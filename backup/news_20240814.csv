32424461,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635467,1723678228,MATIC: Experts Warn Of Key Support Level As Price Hits Two-Year Low Levels,"MATIC, Polygon’s native token, recently suffered a significant price decline amid a broader market downturn. The token dropped over 20% in the past month, reaching its lowest price level in two years. As the market recovers, some analysts have made a bullish case for the token but warned of a key level to watch. Related Reading: Buying The Dip: PEPE Price Recovers 10% As Whales Load Their Bags MATIC Hits Two-Year Low Levels Over the past few months, MATIC has registered a steady decline from its one-year high of $1.27. Since July, the token’s price has retraced 20.5%, falling from the $0.55 support zone to the $0.40 mark. During the August 5 market crash, where most cryptocurrencies plunged by 20%, MATIC fell to a two-year low price of $0.35. This level, last seen in June 2022, represented a 30% decrease from its price at the beginning of the month. MATIC’s market capitalization also fell by 30.2% during the crash, going from $4.6 billion to $3.5 billion. Since then, the token has lost its spot among the top 20 cryptocurrencies by this metric. Polygon’s native token currently sits at the 28th largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $3.8 billion. The token has reclaimed the $0.40 resistance level, hovering between the $0.40 and $0.43 price range. Despite the 22% recovery from the crash, the token continues to move within a range not seen since June 2022. However, some market watchers consider that this level could be the best time to accumulate MATIC at a low price. On Wednesday morning, an analyst highlighted that the token is “at its weekly support, and the RSI has also bottomed out.” All Eyes On Key Support Zone Following this week’s Monday retrace, pseudonym crypto analyst Cryptorphic pointed out that MATIC hit the lower support zone, set between $0.31-$0.38, “as expected.” The analyst emphasized that the token must hold this level, as if “it fails and breaks down, things could turn out poorly.” To Cryptorphic, if the token maintains above the crucial support zone, it could attempt to reclaim another key resistance level at the $0.98 mark. The analyst also set a retest of the token’s all-time high (ATH) price of $2.92 as a long-term target. Similarly, another market watcher pointed out that Polygon’s native token “bounced perfectly from the lower boundary of the falling wedge pattern.” This suggested that investors could expect growth toward the $0.75 resistance level if the token broke above the $0.465 mark. Meanwhile, renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez made a bold prediction for MATIC. According to Martinez, the token “will melt faces” if the altcoin season kicks off. Per the chart, MATIC displays a multi-year descending triangle pattern. A breakout from the upper line of the pattern, set at $0.89, could trigger a massive rally to unprecedented highs similar to the 2021 run.

However, he warned investors not to “go ape yet” as a “weekly close below $0.30 would invalidate the bullish thesis.” As of this writing, MATIC is trading at $0.41, a 1.1% drop in the last 24 hours.

32421433,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635498,1723672800,Dogecoin On Track To Rally 100% To $0.2; Crypto Analyst,"Dogecoin has certainly dipped quite far from its highest point so far this year. While this sideways movement and a recent correction have lingered on for quite some time, the price action is a reflection of the wider crypto market movement. However, DOGE continues to attract bullish opinions among traders. Its popularity and status as the largest meme coin continue to generate optimistic sentiment within the trading community. Crypto analyst Astronomer believes DOGE is still prime for a strong bull run on the technical side of things. According to Astronomer, the current price structure of DOGE demonstrates a relative strength that sets it apart from other cryptocurrencies price action since Q4 2023, suggesting that the coin has the potential to recover and even thrive in the near future. DOGE On Track To Rally Above $0.2 Astronomer’s DOGE technical analysis, which he shared on social media platform X, is based on the cryptocurrency’s price action since the fourth quarter of 2023. The crypto market kickstarted its recent market cycle in Q4 2023 after the applications of Spot Bitcoin ETFs by BlackRock and others. Related Reading: Bitcoin Flashes Inverted Triangle, Analyst Peter Brandt Explains What This Means This event marked the end of a multi-year bearish cycle, leading to bullish sentiment across the entire crypto market. As a result, many cryptocurrencies experienced substantial price increases, which pushed them to reach new multi-year highs. Although many market participants might argue the market is still largely in a bullish cycle, many cryptocurrencies have corrected even below Q4 2023 prices. However, Astronomer notes that DOGE stands out in this regard, as it has managed to maintain a price level above its Q3 2024 value. At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.1057. Although the meme coin is still up by 29% from its price in the beginning of the year, it has corrected 52% from its yearly high of $0.22. Additionally, DOGE has corrected by 12% from its Q3 2024 opening price of $0.121; a pivotal price point. According to crypto analyst Astronomer, all the cryptocurrency needs now is to break above a new local high to solidify the return of a bullish price run. Price Targets For Dogecoin In terms of a price target, the Dogecoin/Tether US price chart shared by the analyst predicts DOGE will double its current value and climb back above the $0.22 price point later this year. The analyst’s projections are even more bullish, suggesting that DOGE could surpass $0.26, which would represent a remarkable 145% increase from its current trading price. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Price Will Rally 10,400% To $60, Here’s When However, the recent DOGE price action suggests various resistances before $0.22. Nonetheless, the analyst remains confident that once DOGE successfully breaks through this local high, it could trigger a renewed and sustained upward movement, further fueling the bullish sentiment surrounding the coin.

According to CoinGecko, FTM gained more than 17% since last week, representing the hype their network migration caused within the community. Related Reading: Celestia (TIA) Gains 14% Following Network Upgrade Announcement The new Sonic Labs is poised to continue Fantom’s legacy as four core proposals are now underway for the eventual release of the Sonic mainnet. If passed, the proposals will provide users and developers with a smooth transition to the Sonic network once D-day arrives. Core Proposals Promise Smooth Transition To Sonic According to the Sonic Labs X account, four proposals will affect the user experience during the switch to the Sonic network. The most notable is the proposed one-to-one ratio between FTM and $S, the native token of the new network. The new token will act like the old FTM token, with 3,175,000,000 $S tokens on Genesis Day. With @MessariCrypto‘s Q2 2024 report, we looked back at the latest quarter in the world of #Sonic, including 4 governance proposals: 💵 190.5M $S Airdrop 🚀 $FTM to $S Compatibility 💰 Ongoing Funding 👥 Validators/Builders Let’s explore the report 👇 pic.twitter.com/Sypi35TTF4 — Sonic Labs (prev. Fantom) (@0xSonicLabs) August 13, 2024 As a general “thank you” gesture to Opera users, the platform will allocate over 190,500,000 $S tokens to airdrop. The airdrop also has safeguards to protect the market from a sudden influx $S tokens. It will have a burn mechanism that penalizes users who choose to claim their airdrop position on day 1, burning almost 100% to 88.9% of the tokens vested for the user. This gives users time to contribute to the overall on-chain activity while providing a guaranteed long-term gain. The new users are also eligible to receive the airdrop once the network is released. 4️⃣ Validators/Builders This proposal approved: ✅ Validator rewards migrated from Opera to #Sonic 🚀 Apps in GasM can earn up to 90% of gas with a new burn model 💰 Ecosystem Vault funds allocated to @SonicCouncil 🔒 14-day staking lock-up period 🔗 https://t.co/KCAtB2rm7t — Sonic Labs (prev. Fantom) (@0xSonicLabs) August 13, 2024 Funding for the new network is also secured as they allocate 47,625,000 $S tokens for running Sonic Spark and Sonic University, providing developers the know-how to build on the platform. To ensure zero wastage of the funds, Sonic will burn the remaining funds if not used within a specified time frame. For example, if only half of the whopping 47,625,000 $S tokens were used, the other half would be burned to protect the integrity of the network while ensuring the funds are not wasted. Validator rewards will also be migrated from Opera to Sonic to promote the use of the network while protecting $S from too much inflation in the first four years. FTM Price To Stabilize On This Level Ahead Of Sonic Network Launch As of press time, the token is struggling to flip the $0.3689 ceiling to support which is crucial for the bulls in the long term. Related Reading: AVAX Set For ATH? Analysts Predict Explosive Rise To $285 Although the token is seemingly slowing down, the market’s general positivity will pick up in the coming days, pushing bears off of the FTM market.

In a strange way, this week's fee cuts at Solana-based memecoin launchpad Pump.fun has, for many traders, made it neither. For observers of the spectacle, however, It's entertaining enough to gawk at the memecoins surrounding former President Donald Trump. Read on.

Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Network news  TRUMP.FUN – Former President Donald Trump's speech just a couple weeks ago at the Bitcoin Nashville conference now seems like a distant memory. Not only has he been overtaken by Vice President Kamala Harris as the frontrunner in this year's U.S. presidential election – at least in the eyes of punters on the prediction-betting site Polymarket – but his name and family members are now regularly getting dragged into conversations about memecoins. It started last week when one of his sons, Eric Trump, tweeted that he has ""fallen in love with Crypto / DeFi. Stay tuned for a big announcement,"" as related by CoinDesk's Krisztian Sandor. Then on Thursday, a newly launched cryptocurrency on Solana (SOL) called Restore the Republic, or RTR, rumored to be the official token of Donald Trump, began trading, shooting to a $155 million market capitalization within hours after the launch. Eric Trump then warned users of ""fake tokens"" and said that the ""only official Trump project has not been announced."" RTR tumbled 95%. His brother, Donald Trump Jr., tweeted that while he loves ""how much the crypto community is embracing Trump,"" traders should ""beware of fake tokens claiming to be part of the Trump project."" Then there was the former president's Spaces session on Monday with X owner Elon Musk, during which the pair notably didn't even mention Bitcoin or crypto. According to The Block, the omission sent prices tumbling for the tokens with names like MAGA Hat and Doland Tremp. The crypto news site Decrypt reported that some 10,000 tokens were launched during the Spaces on the meme coin launchpad Pump.fun, where the $2 issuance fee was completely eliminated earlier this week – making it that much easier and cheaper to launch a token. Based on one account posted on X, after Trump uttered the phrase ""rough people"" about five times in a row, there were at least 10 distinct memecoins launched with the name ""ROUGH PEOPLE."" Some memecoin traders complained that using Pump.fun was ""not fun anymore"" because there were ""10,000 scams."" But for at least one commenter, watching the action felt almost like a news feed: ""I don’t even need to watch the space when there’s pump fun.""  ELSEWHERE:  Crypto executives and investors are pursuing efforts to support Vice President Kamala Harris as the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate, even without a direct indication of how she'll approach the sector. The fledgling ""crypto4harris"" effort is supposed to kick off Wednesday with an online forum at which prominent industry figures are expected to gather under the vice president's banner. Such initiatives don't yet have formal ties to the Harris campaign.  Amid controversy over the recent Venezuelan presidential election, local users of Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, experienced difficulty accessing the site, the company said in a post on X on Friday. ""Like several company websites in different segments in Venezuela, including social media, Binance's pages have been facing access restrictions,"" the exchange posted.  Tigran Gambaryan, the U.S. Binance employee held in Nigeria, is being ""denied adequate access to his legal team and his health is deteriorating rapidly,"" his family said in an emailed statement to CoinDesk on Monday.  Ethereum Set For Overhaul of Crucial Programming Standard With 'EVM Object Format'  Artistically modified screenshot from code describing new EOF ""containers"" (Ipsilon/GitHub, modified by CoinDesk using PhotoMosh)  Ethereum developers are steering toward an upgrade that could bring the most fundamental changes in the network's programming environment since the original smart-contracts blockchain shook up the crypto industry when it launched nearly a decade ago.  The Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) known asEVM Object Format (EOF), which has been discussed extensively in developer circles this year because of some participants' concerns about possible security risks, is now set to be included in a major package of changes expected later this year or early next, known as the Pectra hard fork.  The EOF proposal is a series of smaller changes aiming to update the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), theprogramming environment that executes smart contracts on the blockchain, and arguably Ethereum’s secret sauce that made it different from Bitcoin and other early distributed networks when it launched in 2015.  Specifically, EOF would make smart contracts more developer friendly, especially for those building decentralized applications in Solidity or Vyper programming languages. The series of changes are incredibly delicate that can break existing smart contracts, so developers have added in a new version, allowing dapp builders to choose which version of the EVM to use when deploying their code.  “EOF will be the first major EVM related change in years,” said Parithosh Jayanthi, a core developer at the Ethereum Foundation, over a text message on Telegram to CoinDesk. “It sets the stage for future upgrades to the EVM and showcases the base layers intent to continue to improving the EVM.”  Click here for the full story by Margaux Nijkerk  Protocol Village  Top picks of the past week from our Protocol Village column, highlighting key blockchain tech upgrades and news.

42417446,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYR1p,1723665736,Ghost Chains to Goldmines: How to Create Web3 Products That People Want,"The Web3 industry is currently stagnating when it comes to delivering products that people will actually use, rather than just another gambling tool. This is a point of agreement among many in the space. For months, the conversation has revolved around when funding will arrive for consumer applications. However, there’s no consensus on who is to blame.  The finger-pointing has been directed at venture capitalists (VCs), project founders, other ecosystems, or the very concept of infrastructure. The problem with this blame-game is that it distracts from identifying and addressing the root cause, making it harder to solve the issue. To move forward, we need to step back and understand how we got here. The strategies that brought the blockchain industry to its current state are not the same ones that will propel it to the next level.  The journey of a builder in Web3 today is quite challenging. Let’s say you want to create an actual application instead of founding something like an L2. The path ahead is tough. Traditionally, you would gather a team of potential co-founders and brainstorm how your idea makes sense. Ideally, this team would include individuals who can help build the product through coding. Once your team is in place, you’d decide which blockchain to launch on. Recently, L2s have been popular, but you might also consider non-EVM blockchains like Solana, which are attracting developers. This decision involves several factors: understanding where users are, where they are headed, where liquidity is, the transaction speed and cost your application requires, and, importantly, the incentives different chains offer to help you build your minimum viable product (MVP).  Let’s assume that as a founder, you’ve successfully navigated all the steps above and found a blockchain that offers incentives like grants to support your project. Perhaps the grant is $50,000, or in rare cases, it might be as high as $150,000. Is this amount enough to build, launch, and successfully scale your application? Absolutely not. What do you do next?  Looking at Web2, if you were a founder in this position, you’d reach out to VCs who would evaluate your MVP, listen to your proof-of-concept, understand your business model, and assess your user acquisition success before raising money. The problem in Web3 is that too much funding has gone into infrastructure projects, driven by the potential for token launches that allow VCs to recoup multiples of their investments.  Additionally, it’s challenging to determine the best blockchain for an application due to the unpredictable hype cycles. As a result, VCs prefer the safer bet of infrastructure investments over the uncertain future of a specific blockchain that an application might depend on. And if you never get invested in by a VC, your chances of a successful token launch to create liquidity for yourself decrease immensely.  So what do you do next?  Given your options, the logical decision would be either to become a founder of an infrastructure company or to build lower-quality products that every chain seems to want. In doing so, you might become a ""grant mercenary,"" similar to airdrop hunters who use new blockchains temporarily to collect and sell tokens for profit. Essentially, you’re incentivized to play zero-sum games. And who could blame you?  The problem with this is that, if enough builders repeat this pattern over time and across ecosystems, we end up in the period of purgatory we’re in now. Everyone is upset, almost no one is making money, and nothing valuable is being produced.  Now that we understand the problem, it’s easier to see what it would take to fix it. There are seemingly only four stages needed to create success in this ecosystem, all of which involve aligning incentives for everyone involved.  First, you need a blockchain that makes sense to build on — one with users and liquidity because no builder wants to go to a ghost chain.  Then, you need builders creating products that people want and will use.  After that, you need VCs willing to fund those products.  Finally, you need successful token launches, ideally with centralized exchanges, to create a positive flywheel of success where everyone involved comes out a winner.  Right now, we’re stuck in a situation where blockchains have become the main characters instead of focusing on creating success stories for applications built on their chains. They’ve become complacent, relying on grants from their foundations and wondering why no one wants to build useful things. Instead, they criticize builders for creating copy-paste applications across multiple chains to collect as much grant money as possible. The reality is this behavior is a result of the incentive alignment set up by the blockchains. Builders are simply doing what logically makes sense in this context.  It’s entirely the fault of the blockchains. To get to where they are now, they had to raise massive rounds and create the main-character energy they exhibit today. With a small ecosystem of users and limited liquidity, these blockchains had to do everything possible to attract initial dollars and users to their chain. For many of them, this approach worked. However, it’s now time to evolve. The tactics that brought them success up to this point are not the same ones that will lead to the next phase of true blockchain adoption worldwide.  So how do we move forward?  The answer is simple, but the execution is challenging. Growth requires discomfort.  Blockchains, builders, VCs, and centralized exchanges must come together to find alignment. Blockchains need builders to create valuable applications. Builders need chains that value them and have active users. VCs need innovative projects that can deliver financial returns. Centralized exchanges need tokens that excite users and drive trading. While these four entities haven’t collaborated seamlessly so far, it’s clear they need each other to thrive. When builders can find strong blockchains, secure venture funding, and successfully launch tokens, we’ll enter the next phase of evolution where blockchain adoption becomes the norm.

Massive Silk Road Bitcoin Influx To Coinbase According to on-chain data tracker Arkham, the US government recently moved 10,000 Bitcoin worth around $590 million from a known government wallet to a Coinbase Prime deposit address. Notably, this transfer sparked a 3.3% dip in the Bitcoin price, which fell below the key $60,000 support level to trade at around $59,130 at the time of writing. However, it’s important to note that the US government’s selection of Coinbase as the custodian for its seized digital assets may only sometimes lead to immediate selling. Related Reading: XRP Price Eyes $0.60 Reclaim: Crucial for a Fresh Upswing As reported by Bitcoinist, Coinbase announced that the US Department of Justice’s asset forfeiture division, the US Marshal Service, had chosen Coinbase Prime to offer custody and advanced trading services for its “Class 1” digital assets. This partnership is intended to streamline the custody, management, and disposal processes for cryptocurrency assets, allowing for diversification in the types of digital assets that can be handled and disposed of under the government’s forfeiture programs. Ultimately, this may result in the exchange holding this large amount of BTC and not affect the Bitcoin price in the short term or contribute to selling pressure unless there is a shift from previous movements and the authorities decide to liquidate the tokens. Critical Resistance Levels And Support Thresholds In a recent analysis of the current Bitcoin price action, crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades recently highlighted key levels to watch for a potential continuation of BTC’s recovery over the past seven days after falling towards $59,000 on August 5th. The analyst first noted that Bitcoin is at a pivotal point where it needs to break above the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $59,468 and the 200-day moving average (MA) at $62,274. Daan Crypto Trades explains that these levels are key to catalyzing favorable medium-to-long-term dynamics in favor of the bulls. However, the cryptocurrency has struggled with this challenge and failed to consolidate above these levels last week. Related Reading: Maker Sees 7% Upswing As Key Indicators Signal $2,662 Resistance Test In light of this scenario, the analyst has identified two significant resistance levels that the BTC price must uphold if a potential correction looms. Daan Crypto Trades underscores the importance of vigilance around the $56,530 mark on the BTC/USDT daily chart, emphasizing its role as a critical floor crucial for preventing a downturn that could mirror the substantial 20% correction witnessed at the commencement of August. Moreover, the analyst points to the $52,990 threshold as the subsequent support level to monitor should Bitcoin falter at the aforementioned mark, especially if selling pressure intensifies, exerting downward pressure on its price trajectory.

32415510,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635405,1723662029,Ethereum Price To Hit New All-Time High If This Happens: Crypto Analyst,"Crypto analyst Poseidon (@CryptoPoseidonn) has released a detailed price prediction for Ethereum (ETH). His analysis, delivered to his 123,000 followers on social media platform X, revolves around the pivotal $2,160-$1,900 price range which has historically served as a significant high-timeframe (HTF) support since the summer of 2021. ETH Price Analysis: $8,000 Is Possible If … According to Poseidon, Ethereum recently retested what he describes as the “most crucial support level on the chart” after a significant breakout earlier in the year. This price zone has consistently acted as a key battleground for bulls and bears, making it a central focus of technical analysis. “Early in 2024, we broke out of this level, leading to a substantial price increase because this was the only resistance holding us back. Now, after 200 days, we are back at the same level, and for me, buying ETH here is an opportunity,” Poseidon detailed in his analysis. Related Reading: Bigger Risks More Returns: Ethereum’s Volatility Surpasses Bitcoin’s by 50%, Data Shows The resilience of the $1,900 support level is critical to Ethereum’s bullish outlook. A breach below this level without quick recovery would likely indicate a cycle top and could precipitate a drop to as low as $1,000, marking a significant reversal in the prevailing market trend. However, Poseidon assesses this risk as low, expressing confidence in the support’s reliability: “I find this scenario highly unlikely. I believe the price will bottom out in this range, marking a significant HTF low.” Looking forward, Poseidon sets conditional targets that rely on Ethereum reclaiming and stabilizing above certain price thresholds. Initially, ETH needs to breach the $3,000 mark, followed by $3,500, to set the stage for a potential rally to new highs. “If we manage to surpass $5,000, I think $7,000-$8,000 is realistic. Although I believe we could go much higher, anything above $8,000 would be risky for me to stay in longs. I’d be extremely cautious and would sell quickly if the daily trend breaks down,” he stated. To justify these targets, Poseidon employs Fibonacci retracement levels, a common tool among traders for predicting potential reversals, support, and resistance levels based on prior market movements. These projections, however, are contingent on the market maintaining its structure without significant trend breaks. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Ready For 75% Breakout To $4,723, Here’s Why The transition to a bullish market phase for Ethereum hinges on several key technical indicators. First, Ethereum needs to reclaim and hold the 200-day EMA to signal strengthening momentum. Second, the crypto asset must maintain support above the range low which is crucial for continued bullish sentiment. Third, overcoming the daily supply zone from $3,100 to $3,200 will likely test Ethereum’s resilience, which if successful, could solidify the asset’s upward trajectory. Poseidon elaborates on the challenges of this bullish flip, noting the current bearish sentiment and the difficulty of breaking above these resistance levels. “While we’re sitting at a strong weekly and monthly support level, we’re still in a downtrend. To confirm this level as the bottom, we need to shift the daily trend to bullish again.” Adding to his technical analysis, Poseidon highlights the H8 timeframe and its EMA200 as the “GOAT” (Greatest of All Time) for trend determination. “I’ve studied the H8 EMA200 on ETH since 2018, compared it with other EMAs and timeframes, and I can confidently say that the H8 EMA200 is the GOAT,” he asserts. This particular timeframe and moving average provide a unique insight into shorter-term price movements and are key to Poseidon’s trading strategy. At press time, ETH traded at $2,753.90.

42417434,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYQpR,1723661365,Democrats Make Pitch For Crypto Voters. Will Crypto Listen?,"When Donald Trump gave his landmark speech at the recent Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, it seemed like the Republican presidential nominee might have a lock on the crypto vote going into November’s election. But, with President Biden deciding not to run and Kamala Harris taking his place at the top of the ticket, parts of the crypto community seem inclined to give Democrats another chance on crypto policymaking.  Possibly.  Tonight, Crypto4Harris, a group of Democrat-leaning crypto advocates, is organizing an online “townhall” to discuss the way forward. “Come meet the crypto industry leaders, policy professionals, and enthusiasts who are organizing on behalf of the Harris for President campaign,” the invite reads.  The confirmed speaker list features some well-known names from Congress and the crypto industry, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), businessman Mark Cuban, Anthony Scaramucci, a former White House communications director under President Trump and now CEO of Skybridge Capital, and high profile crypto lobbyists such as Sheila Warren, CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, and Justin Slaughter, VP of Regulatory Affairs at Paradigm.  Custodia Bank CEO Caitlin Long, who has many reasons to distrust the Biden Administration given the regulatory troubles of her own project, said she would attend tonight’s town hall with an open mind. “I'll join @Crypto4Harris event tomorrow & hope …. that moderate Dems have ended Biden/Warren crackdown on law-abiding #crypto cos,” she wrote on X/Twitter.  The people behind the efforts to organize on behalf of the vice president say the goal is to encourage Harris to signal ""an openness and a willingness to have a reset"" with the sector, according to reporting from CoinDesk’s Jesse Hamilton. Scaramucci, who now campaigns against his former boss, has told Democrats that they have made a “horrific mistake” in not being more willing to set clear rules-of-the-road for the crypto industry during the Biden Administration. Many of the Harris-aligned group speak badly of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, a close ally of Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), the standard bearer for anti-crypto sentiment in Congress.  Critics say the industry should pay more attention to Harris’ actions than her words. They point to how two advisers on her team – Brian Deese and Bharat Ramamurti – were part of Biden’s National Economic Council and associated with anti-crypto policy initiatives, including, these critics claim, efforts to de-bank crypto companies under an unofficial policy known as “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.”  Others, however, note that Harris’ campaign includes other advisers who have worked with crypto companies before, including David Plouffe (Binance) and Gene Sperling (Ripple).  Brian Krassenstein, a podcaster with more than 850K followers on X, is organizing a pro-Harris pro-crypto Spaces right after the Crypto4Harris main event.  “Personally, I think she will hire new people once her new administration starts. I don’t see her keeping Gensler, and I also don’t see her keeping the same advisors that Biden had,” Krassenstein said over X DMs. “I know that [Harris] has been very open about listening to those within the crypto space.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Benjamin Schiller,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/news-analysis/2024/08/14/democrats-make-pitch-for-crypto-voters-will-crypto-listen,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a71999a4ba2699261e34b107f7454b0f53110423-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Miners seek cheap energy, leading to two strategies: being in front of the meter (I.e., grid-tied) and being behind the meter (i.e., direct co-location with power generators).  The grid-tied model allows for economies of scale, as large-scale miners may obtain cheaper energy rates based on the load size they bring onto the grid, and participation in “Demand Response” and ancillary services, enabled by the interruptible nature of this type of compute.  The co-location model feeds on deadweight loss and mismatches between energy demand & supply, targeting intermittent renewables (e.g., solar & wind) and baseloads (e.g., hydro, nuclear, geothermal). Being behind the meter entails business models such vertical integration, partnerships, and joint ventures, enabling miners to engage in energy arbitrage and generating Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs).

Hashrate offers investment opportunities for individuals to participate in Bitcoin mining without owning hardware. In addition, derivatives allow for hedging against price fluctuations, providing risk management tools for miners and investors. The value of hashrate is tied to the demand for Bitcoin mining, influenced by Bitcoin price and mining profitability, but is susceptible to regulatory challenges. Despite these challenges, Bitcoin hashrate presents a compelling case as a novel commodity with unique investment and trading opportunities. As the Bitcoin ecosystem evolves, the role and significance of hashrate as a tradable asset are likely to grow, attracting further attention and innovation within capital markets.  Hash price vs. Hash cost  Hash price and hash cost are key metrics influencing the Bitcoin mining landscape. While often confused, they represent distinct aspects of mining profitability.  Hash price, the price per unit of hashpower, reflects the current market value of mining power. It's calculated by dividing the total daily mining revenue by the network hashrate. A higher hash price indicates greater profitability for miners.  Hash cost represents the cost of producing one unit of hashpower, encompassing expenses like electricity, hardware, and maintenance. A lower hashcost signifies a more efficient and profitable mining operation.  The difference between hash price and hash cost determines mining profitability. When hash price exceeds hash cost, miners reap profits. Conversely, when hash cost surpasses hash price, they operate at a loss. High hash price attracts more miners, increasing competition and potentially driving down hash price. Conversely, low hash price may discourage miners, leading to a decrease in network hashrate and potentially pushing hash price back up.  The availability of ASICs also has an impact on the relationship between hash price and hash cost. These mining machines and the current kW/h wholesale price of electricity drives network hashpower, which drives mining difficulty. Where ASICs aren’t readily available, hashpower becomes more valuable, and therefore the delta between hashprice and hashcost should expand, creating profitable opportunities for miners.  Understanding the relationship between hash price and hash cost is crucial for miners to make informed decisions. The delta between hash price and hash cost will also influence a miner’s ability to raise capital. Miners aim to lower hash cost for increased profitability, impacting their capital-raising ability. A smaller hash price-hash cost gap makes miners susceptible to Bitcoin price factors like energy costs and mining difficulty. Conversely, a larger gap suggests resilience. Lenders assessing loan risk will scrutinize this gap, pressuring inefficient miners seeking capital due to their preference for low-risk returns.  For example, Runes, a recently released way for Bitcoin to create non-fungible tokens, temporarily increased Bitcoin blockspace demand, leading to higher transaction fees and longer confirmation times. During this time, hash price futures were trading in Contango vs the spot price suggesting that the market had a high likelihood of increased future blockspace demand.  This situation prompted Bitcoin miners to sell hash price futures, locking in future revenue; that was a decision that proved prudent as blockspace demand cooled post-halving. The availability of hashrate linked products now also provides more financial data points to predict network events impact on blockspace demand and transaction fees.

Crypto Analyst Provides Answers","Bitcoin has not been in the $20,000 range going on two years now and some believe that the pioneer cryptocurrency will never revisit this level again. However, according to one analyst, the Bitcoin price falling back to $20,000 is a matter of when, not if. While they do not expect that this crash will happen anytime soon, they have warned that the possibility should not be ruled out at this point. Bitcoin Price Could Go For $20,000 Crypto analyst “Without Worries”, in a new analysis on the TradingView website, has outlined the possibility for the Bitcoin price to crash to $20,000 once again. The analysis focuses on the Bitcoin price on the 3-week chart, which showed some interesting insights into the movement of the digital asset. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Price Will Rally 10,400% To $60, Here’s When According to the crypto analyst, there are some important events that have taken place, giving birth to the expectation that this will happen. One of these has to do with the Stochastics RSI that has made some notable moves. As the crypto analyst points out, the Stochastic RSI had moved above 80 and then eventually crossed back down to 50. This move in the Stochastic RSI, which happens to be one of the most important indicators of bull and bear cycles, shows resistance is building. At this point, the analyst advises investors to watch out for confirmation of resistance that could signal the start of the downtrend. Looking back, the crypto analyst revealed that resistance had previously appeared back in 2018 and 2019. What followed was a downtrend. Then again, in 2021, the resistance appeared, and each time, there was an average 70% decline following the resistance. If this resistance were to reappear, then historical performance would suggest that the Bitcoin price would follow the same trend. In that case, a 70% decline from the current all-time high price would mean that the BTC price does return to the $20,000 level once again. However, this is months away from playing out, according to the analyst. Will BTC Rally Into 2025? Touching on the topic of the Bitcoin bull run continuing into the year 2025, the crypto analyst does not believe this is possible. He believes that with so many calls for the pioneer cryptocurrency to reach new peaks, it is not going to happen. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Ready For 75% Breakout To $4,723, Here’s Why However, the analyst does not believe that the market has topped at this point. They point out that the market is still in fear, which is not an ideal time for the market to reach its top. Instead, the top will come when the market is in euphoria. “When this RSI resistance confirms, there will be no long opportunities in the market until 2027 at the earliest,” the analyst said in closing.

42417448,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYR4v,1723655486,The Anatomy of a Meltdown (and Just BTFD),"There has been much consternation in traditional markets of late, with a variety of reasons to blame. First, the Bank of Japan raised interest rates to combat the falling yen, causing traders to unwind yen-carry trade positions. Second, worries around U.S. economic growth came to the fore after a series of disappointing releases, especially the latest employment report. And finally, fears of a wider war in the Middle East arose after Iran vowed retaliation for the assassination of a Hamas political leader.  Such financial, economic, and geopolitical uncertainty caused widespread panic, resulting in, for example, Japan’s Nikkei recording its largest single-day drop since 1987 and many large U.S. tech stocks falling by double digits over several days, just to name a few.  Cryptocurrencies, which would have been expected to fall by a greater amount than equities anyway, had their own negative drivers, including impending Mt. Gox fallout, mixed spot digital asset ETF flows, a rising appreciation that pro-crypto Trump candidacy isn’t a lock, and reports of a large market maker dumping hundreds of millions of dollars of crypto during the panic’s peak. All in, Bitcoin touched $49,200, down 30% from just a week earlier, while Ethereum fell below $2,200, dropping 35% over that time.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Towering Bull Tenets and Fading Risks Offer Chance at $1m BTC  Despite the downturn, we remain as convinced as ever in the bull thesis, with its core tenets towering in place:  Central Bank Rate Cuts: We stand at the beginning of global monetary easing. As shown below, rising global liquidity has historically catalyzed Bitcoin.  ETF Flows: Thespot Bitcoin ETFs have garnered $17b of net flows, the spot Ethereum ETFs are getting over the ETHE outflow hump, and the wirehouses are starting to allow FAs to solicit allocation, all amounting to a slow-but-steady TWAP buy.  Improving U.S. Stance: Regardless of who becomes President, a greater desire from both parties to institute clear guardrails that protect consumers and foster innovation will ultimately ignite a wave of corporate activity.  Bitcoin for Governments: Though low odds and likely requiring a Trump victory, the creation of a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve could prompt a nation state-level war for Bitcoin, given the potential implications and game theoretic buying by others.  Oh, and these near-term bull tenets say nothing of crypto’s supreme driver, which iswhat it will, over decades, ultimately become.  Global Liquidity vs. Bitcoin Price, Year-Over-Year Growth  Source: The People’s Bank of China, Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan, Investing.com, Glassnode, GSR  Note: Converts local currency M2 to US dollars and aggregates before taking year-over-year growth. Note that different countries may define M2 slightly differently, but the general concept of M2 is that of a measure of the money supply that includes cash, checking deposits, and non-cash assets that can easily be converted into cash.  And, while there may always be a black swan event, it’s hard to identify many large and likely risks. For example:  Dissipating Overhangs: The specters of past sins are resolving, whether it be FTX returning $13b of cash to creditors or Mt Gox disbursing BTC to victims of its hack. To boot, these may turn into catalysts as FTX cash is reinvested and the Mt Gox overhang is removed.  Traditional Markets Risks: Financial and economic uncertainty may be ebbing, with the BOJ suggesting rate hikes are done for now and Goldman Sachs ascribing just a 25% chance of a US recession (and the Fed pledging to “fix it” should growth slow).  Others: Other risks like the U.S. selling its $13b seized BTC portfolio, heavy altcoin unlocks, or CEX/stablecoin insolvencies could go the other way, seem manageable, or appear of falling odds.  All in, should the bull tenets materialize, risks fade, and crypto make strides towards its endgame – perhaps with a dapp that goes mainstream or Bitcoin/Ethereum’s adoption as the world settlement layer – we believe Bitcoin would easily surpass $1m, skewing the risk-reward exceedingly positive at just about any odds of the above occurring. Imagine, instead of Bitcoin as “digital gold,” gold becomes relegated to “physical Bitcoin.”  The Dip as a Gift - Time to Buy  Ultimately, we see the recent dip as a gift, offering a solid entry point and pushing crypto to its greatest risk-reward in years. Indeed, ETH is lower than prior to the SEC’sstunning about face on the Ethereum ETFs, while Bitcoin is down from prior to theU.S. changing its stance towards crypto. Yes, we’re in a very different macro environment than before, but it’s hard to argue these catalysts are priced in any major way.  So while 30%+ drawdowns are indeed disconcerting, they create compelling opportunities. And while it’d be easy to come away negative after the events of last week, using price to inform one’s view of the underlying fundamentals is a recipe to buy high and sell low. Instead, the best analysts check whether the cause of any adverse price movements invalidated their thesis, and if not, they grow the position given the now-much-greater upside.  So with the bull tenets squarely in place as risks fade, a legit chance of $1m Bitcoin, and greater potential upside after the recent dip, the risk-reward has rarely looked so compelling.

42417445,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYR0n,1723653898,Bitcoin Price May Turn Lower as Crypto Exchanges See $1B USDT Withdrawal: IntoTheBlock,"Bitcoin started a downtrend soon when USDT exchange outflows surpassed $1 billion earlier this year, ""suggesting investors may be adopting a risk-off stance,"" IntoTheBlock said.  The current price action ""feels eerily similar"" to last year's when bitcoin traded sideways for two months after a large capitulation in August, one analyst noted.  Cryptocurrency prices sharply rebounded from last week's turmoil as bitcoin {{BTC}} rebounded to above $60,000 after falling below $50,000 during the Aug. 5 crash. But further upside might be elusive – at least based on one metric that has foreshadowed recent local tops.  Crypto analytics firm IntoTheBlock noted that more than $1 billion of Tether's USDT stablecoin was withdrawn from crypto exchanges on Tuesday, the most in a day since May.  ""In recent cases where withdrawals exceeded $1 billion, bitcoin began a downtrend soon after, suggesting investors may be adopting a risk-off stance, moving funds to safer environments like cold wallets in anticipation of market volatility,"" IntoTheBlock analysts said.  However, there are nuances to interpreting the data. While stablecoin deposits to exchanges are positive, signaling fresh funds arriving to buy assets, withdrawals are not always negative as users might move funds to decentralized finance (DeFi) to earn yield. Notably, yields for providing USDT liquidity in DeFi pools have been trending lower, DefiLlama data shows.  Bitcoin fell to $59,000 during Wednesday U.S. trading session, fully retracing yesterday's surge above $61,000 despite Wednesday's U.S. CPI inflation report reassuring expectations of an interest rate cut in September.  Zooming out, seasonal trends are neither in favor of higher crypto prices. Most of the time during bitcoin's history, August and September brought negative monthly returns, data compiled by CoinGlass shows.  Well-followed crypto analyst Miles Deutscher pointed out that bitcoin's current price action resembles last year's action. Then, BTC tumbled to $24,000 from the top of its range at $30,000 during a large leverage flush in August and traded mostly sideways for two months before commencing a rally in October.

Global stock market pressures, interest rate hikes, and recession fears led to selling pressure on US technology stocks and the strongly correlated Bitcoin. Thus, sentiment has turned bearish. A final panic has an increased likelihood until the end of September or mid of October and should bring the start of a new uptrend. Technically speaking, Bitcoin might not need to make a new low but could shake of the remaining weak hands with a tricky and tenacious sideways consolidation over the coming one or two months. Not surprisingly, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has experienced significant market fluctuations over the last few weeks. While Bitcoin spent most of the spring with a boring sideways consolidation, volatility has exploded in recent weeks. Hence, the exuberant ETF euphoria is gone and pessimism is spreading among investors. Review Since the new all-time high of USD 73,793 on March 14th, Bitcoin and all those new Bitcoin spot ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , BITO , ARKB , BITB , HODL , BRRR , EZBC , ARKW , BITX , BITQ , WGMI , BTCW , BTF , STCE and BETH as well as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) initially only digested its enormous price gains slowly and sluggishly through a sideways consolidation until mid-June. From mid-June onwards, there was a first sharp pullback down to USD 53,550, from which Bitcoin was able to recover in no time. However, the round psychological resistance of USD 70,000 could not be recaptured again. Instead, due to numerous factors, global stock markets came under pressure from the end of July. A treacherous mix of geopolitical tensions, an interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan, weak US economic data and fears of recession led to selling pressure on US technology stocks. As expected, the closely correlated Bitcoin could not escape this massacre. Hence, over the first weekend of August until Monday, 5th of August, there was a dramatic crash in the crypto sector, too. With a low at USD 49,577, Bitcoin fell to its lowest level since February 12th. Almost all of the gains since the launch of the Bitcoin Spot ETFs were temporarily wiped out, and the correction we had been expecting for months finally became reality. Strong bounce: +26.5% in four days But Bitcoin wouldn’t be Bitcoin if it hadn’t immediately staged a sharp and impressive bounce back to USD 62,729 in the following days. This rapid recovery shows that confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects remains intact, despite existing macroeconomic risks such as recession concerns and geopolitical tensions. At the same time, however, the general mood in financial markets has quickly improved again over the course of last week, too. This may have contributed to the positive dynamics in the crypto sector in recent days as well. Overall, it is still too early to call for the end of the correction in the stock markets. Accordingly, caution is still advisable when it comes to Bitcoin. Technical Analysis for Bitcoin in US-Dollar Bitcoin Weekly Chart – Buyers are waiting below USD 55,000 Bitcoin in USD, weekly chart as of August 13th, 2024. (Tradingview) Since the new all-time high of USD 73,794 on March 14, Bitcoin has been in an extended consolidation for almost five months. With a pullback of almost 33%, one can now also speak of a correction. Nevertheless, this correction is still very manageable in the bigger picture. From the bear market low of USD 15,479 to the new all-time high of USD 73,794, Bitcoin rose by almost 377% and has now corrected slightly more than the classic 31.8% Fibonacci retracement (USD 51,518). The long wick of last week’s candle in the range between USD 50,000 and USD 55,000 also makes it clear that there were plenty of new buyers lurking below USD 55,000. A similar development was already observed at the beginning of July when prices fell to USD 53,550, only to immediately attract a lot of new buyers. Tenacious and boring sideways consolidation might be enough to get rid of all the weak hands However, we suspect that Bitcoin may still need to correct a bit further, especially in terms of time. If, for example, the cup and handle pattern that was identified months ago continues to manifest itself, the consolidation could possibly even drag on until the end of the year. However, this does not necessarily have to lead to new lows below USD 50,000. A tenacious and boring sideways period could also be enough to push the last weak hands out of the market right in time before the next big rise will start. Overall, the weekly chart is more or less neutral, as the rapid recovery in recent days has initially made up for much of the technical damage. However, the stochastic oscillator has challenges to activate a clear buy signal, while the candlestick structure of recent weeks makes a rather bearish impression. As of now, the correction will only come to a clear and unambiguous end if the bulls manage to break free with a weekly closing price above USD 74,000. Bitcoin Daily Chart – Strong resistance around USD 62,000 Bitcoin in USD, daily chart as of August 13th, 2024. (Tradingview) On the daily chart, Bitcoin has slipped significantly below its 200-day line (USD 62,174) during the sell-off and has not yet been able to regain it despite the rapid recovery. Nevertheless, the countermovement has led to a new buy signal from the stochastic oscillator. If the bulls can clear the double resistance of the falling 50-day line (USD 61,732) and the rising 200-day line (USD 62,174) in the area around USD 62,000 in the coming days, further recovery potential to around USD 68,000 to USD 70,000 should open up immediately. If the bulls fail to recapture the 200-day, however, the technical picture will become significantly cloudier. Accordingly, at least a reunion with the zone between USD 53,500, and USD 55,000 should be taken into account. Overall, the daily chart briefly turned bullish due to the strong countermovement/recovery. However, the significant pullback since last Friday does not bode well. Below USD 62,000, the bears are still in control. Sentiment Bitcoin – First signs of panic Crypto Fear & Greed Index, as of August 7th, 2024. (Bitcoin Magazine Pro) For the first time since the end of 2022, the “Crypto Fear & Greed Index” shows a sharp increase in panic among market participants, with a low of 29 out of 100 points. CMC Crypto Fear & Greed Index as of August 7th, 2024. (Coinmarketcap) So far, it has only been a brief panic. In the past, however, such uncertainty usually needed to lasted longer than just a few days. The sharp price drop within just a week is likely to have thrown highly leveraged market participants out of the market. But it usually takes more time and pain to get rid of all the weak hands in time for the next big rise. Only then will the potential for surprise be sustainably on the upside again. Overall, from a contrarian point of view, sentiment is slowly but surely becoming very interesting again. However, we would like to see at least several weeks of a depressed mood. So far, that is not yet the case. In this respect, the sentiment analysis still urges patience. Seasonality Bitcoin – Seasonality extremely unfavorable until the end of September Seasonality for Bitcoin, as of May 3rd, 2024. (Seasonax) According to seasonal statistics, Bitcoin is in its worst phase of the year. On average, over the last 14 years, Bitcoin prices have mostly fallen sharply from mid-August to the end of September or the beginning of October. In addition, there is a strong correlation with the stock markets, for which unfavorable seasonal trends (“Sell in May”) have also been active since the beginning of May. In summary, the seasonality is extremely unfavorable until at least the end of September. The seasonal traffic light is therefore still dark red. Sound Money: Bitcoin vs. Gold, Bitcoin -This correction is probably not over yet Bitcoin/Gold ratio, daily chart as of August 10, 2024. (Tradingview) With prices of around USD 58,400 for one Bitcoin and around USD 2,462 for one ounce of gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ), you currently have to pay around 23.72 ounces of gold for one Bitcoin. Put another way, one ounce of gold currently costs around 0.042 Bitcoin. While the correction in Bitcoin against the US dollar since mid-March has by no means been very obvious, a surprisingly clear picture emerges against gold. Thus, the Bitcoin/Gold-ratio has been falling in a defined downward trend channel since March 14th. With the crash at the beginning of last week, Bitcoin had already corrected more than 50% of its previous upward movement against gold. Accordingly, the Bitcoin/Gold-ratio has fallen very significantly within around five months from values ​​of around 34.5 down to around 21.4. In addition to the classic 61.8% retracement at around 18.8, the uptrend line that started in January 2023 is waiting at around 19 as the ultimate support. At the very latest, the Bitcoin/Gold-ratio should be able to turn upwards again in this area. Overall, Bitcoin’s correction against the price of gold has already progressed quite far. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that the seasonally weak months of September and October could still see a final exaggeration towards the south. The Bitcoin/gold-ratio should come up with the turning point and subsequently with a trend reversal in the area of ​​around 19 Macro Update – Interest rate hike in Japan triggers stress in the global financial casino Yen vs. MAG, as of August 9, 2024. ( Holger Zschäpitz) Since the end of May, we had increasingly anticipated a correction in the markets. Indeed, the global financial casino finally came under significant pressure at the end of July. In particular, the unwinding of yen carry trade positions caused increased stress from July 23rd onwards. We had already analyzed the unfavorable constellation for the Bank of Japan in May and warned at that time against an interest rate hike in Japan ( EWJ ). After investors and speculators had taken out low-interest loans in Japanese yen for many years and invested in higher-yielding currencies and US assets, these loans had to be unwound or reversed very suddenly and quickly from mid-July onwards. The Bank of Japan’s interest rate hike on July 31st ultimately led to a sharp rise in the yen ( FXY )( USD:JPY ), which weighed on exporters’ earnings forecasts and led to panic selling in the markets. This particularly affected the Japanese market, where the Topix ( OTC:TPXXF ) ( SPTOPIXUSDNTRWM ) index fell by over 24% from its record high. VIX with record spike Volatility S&P500 index (VIX) spikes , as of August 10th, 2024. (Holger Zschäpitz) As a result, the VIX volatility index exploded by 150% to 59.2 on Monday, August 5th, indicating a high level of panic & selling stress. This spike in the VIX thus reached the third-highest level in the last 35 years. Only the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 and the Covid crash in 2020 caused greater panic swings. The stock and crypto markets initially slid deep into the basement accordingly. Even the price of gold fell from USD 2,477 down to USD 2,366 within just 24 hours. However, the sharp spike in the VIX on Monday afternoon already indicated a short-term, completely exaggerated panic. Not surprisingly, the situation calmed down quite quickly in the following days. The markets also stabilized thanks to the Bank of Japan’s announcement that it would not raise interest rates any further for the time being. A 20% setback occurs approximately every four years Frequency of 10% and 20% pullbacks, as of August 7th, 2024. (Bank of America) A new Bank of America’s analysis highlights the following. – 5% pullbacks occur approximately 3 times per year– 10% pullbacks occur approximately once per year– 15% pullbacks occur on average every two years– 20% pullbacks occur approximately every 3 to 4 years The recent pullbacks in the DAX and S&P500, each of around 10%, correspond roughly to the magnitude of corrections that occur once a year. The last time the markets corrected by more than 20% was four and a half years ago, though! Hence, the sharp pullback at the beginning of August may have cracked the market psychology, meaning that further distortions and turbulence could occur in September and October. And despite the quick recovery, the increased volatility is likely to have eroded the yen’s safe-haven status and will make carry trades less attractive due to the increased risk. So, despite the interest rate differentials still being desirable, it may take at least some time before investors and speculators consider returning to these trades. First US interest rate cut in September The increasingly weak economic data from the USA has not improved with the panic sell-off, either. In fact, the US economy is likely to be in a worse state than previously assumed. The financial markets have now abruptly started to price in justified fears of a recession and a first US interest rate cut in September. However, we suspect that this step by the Fed will come too late. The euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence, which had previously driven technology stocks in particular since December 2022, is also likely to continue to subside or let off some more hot air. Accordingly, the revaluation of many tech stocks is particularly weighing on the Nasdaq 100, with which Bitcoin is closely correlated. The intense U.S. election campaign is unlikely to calm tempers, but rather has the potential to increase uncertainty and tension until at least early November. In addition, the well-known geopolitical tensions remain virulent and are likely to continue to cause increased volatility and growing uncertainty on the financial markets. At the moment, one can only hope that Iran’s announced reaction against Israel will not lead to an uncontrolled conflagration in the Middle East. Possible panic sell-off in September and October S&P500 seasonality over the last 25 years, as of August 12th, 2024. (Seasonax) In addition to the numerous macro factors and escalating geopolitics, the seasonal pattern for the S&P 500 and thus essentially for the entire financial system shows a significantly increased probability of a pullback, correction or crash in the two autumn months of September and October. The markets very often come under pressure during this period and then find an important low point, from which a rally can typically start until the end of the year. S&P500 Sentiment, medium-term optimism index (Optix), as of August 12th, 2024. (Sentimentrader) With the significant pullback, the mood among investors has already been affected. On this basis, an extension of the correction to over -20% would also be conceivable. Such corrections typically occur every four years. With the sentiment index for the S&P 500, one can currently draw parallels to the last slump in February 2020. Consequently, there are quite a few indicators pointing to the likelihood of experiencing the typical four-year low in the financial markets this autumn. Overall, the outlook for the stock markets and thus for Bitcoin, as it is closely correlated with tech stocks, appears unfavorable until approximately mid to late October. The current market conditions could potentially trigger a panic sell-off this fall. Therefore, we recommend maintaining a relaxed approach during the remaining summer weeks, with a higher liquidity ratio. Ideally, by October, the market will be dominated by pessimists, who could then become the driving force (wall of worry) for the next rally and the continuation of the crack-up boom. Conclusion: Bitcoin – This correction is probably not over yet To the surprise of many and within just a few days starting at the end of July, the unwinding of the yen carry trade accelerated. A liquidity crisis immediately spread throughout the entire financial system. All sectors were sold off in blind panic. Bitcoin in particular came under severe pressure, falling by 30% within a week. Even the price of gold was also unable to escape the sell-off. In the middle of summer or mid-August, the stress in the stock markets, which undoubtedly have considerable correction potential due to the strong price increases alone, is most likely not yet over. We suggest bracing for more, as more challenges are looming! On top, the seasonal pattern typically delivers significantly more stress into autumn. And Bitcoin will not be able to escape this. “Patience is bitter, but its fruit is sweet.” – Aristotle We therefore expect the correction to intensify over the next one to two months, and would not be surprised if the markets crashed temporarily. A panic sell-off lasting several weeks should then provide patient investors with very good entry opportunities in September or October, or at the latest, after the US election in early November.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4714489-bitcoin-this-correction-is-probably-not-over-yet?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/32410680.jpeg

32409825,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635406,1723651241,"Maker Sees 7% Upswing As Key Indicators Signal $2,662 Resistance Test","Maker (MKR) is currently demonstrating bullish moves with a 7% upswing, positioning it for a critical resistance test at $2,662. This surge reflects growing optimistic sentiment as key technical indicators suggest that the cryptocurrency could be on the verge of a significant breakout. As the market turns green, expectations are that the price of Maker maintain this momentum and push through the $2,662 resistance level, potentially setting the stage for further gains. This article tends to offer a clear understanding of Maker’s potential price trajectory by analyzing the recent price movement, exploring technical indicators, and assessing the significance of the $2,662 resistance level. In the past 24 hours, Maker has gone up by 7.01%, reaching around $2,133, with a market capitalization of over $1.9 billion and a trading volume exceeding $114 million at the time of writing. Maker’s market cap has increased by 7.14%, while its trading volume has surged by 66.30%. Understanding The 7% Surge: What’s Driving Maker’s Momentum? Currently, the price of Maker on the 1-hour chart is bullish and is approaching the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the $2,662 mark. The digital asset has been on an upward spiral since it failed to break below the key level of $1,731, which indicates that the bulls are gaining control of the market and could drive the price higher. Additionally, an analysis of the 1-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that the signal line of the indicator has successfully risen above 50% toward 70%, suggesting that buying pressure greatly increases and the asset might experience further upward movement. On the 4-hour, although Maker is still trading below the 100-day SMA, it can be observed that the crypto asset is attempting a bullish move toward the 100-day SMA, printing two bullish momentum candlesticks. After the rebound at $1,731, Maker has shown bullish resilience, keeping its pace above this level. With this recent bullish sentiment, the digital asset could extend its rally toward the $2,662 resistance level. Finally, on the 4-hour chart, the RSI indicator also indicates a rising bullish momentum for the cryptocurrency as the RSI signal line has moved out of the overbought zone and is currently heading toward the 50% level. Breaking Through $2,662: What It Could Mean For The Future Of Maker If the bulls can sustain their strength in the market, the price of Maker will continue to move upward toward the $2,662 resistance level. Should the price break and close above the $2,662 level, it may continue to rally toward the next resistance point at $3,222 and possibly other levels. However, if Maker reverses direction at the $2,662 resistance level, it would begin to drop toward the direction of its previous support range at $1,731. When the price breaches this support range, it could signal a deeper bearish trend, leading to further price declines towards other lower levels.

42417440,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYQxh,1723651200,"As Restaking Takes Shape on Solana, Ethereum's Renzo Jumps in With 'ezSOL'","Early efforts on the Solana blockchain to develop a framework for ""restaking"" – a way of securing new protocols and applications without having to spin up additional validator networks – appear to be gaining traction.  Jito Labs, a developer of infrastructure tools for Solana, has yet to launch its planned restaking effort on mainnet. But the mere prospect of this potentially lucrative greenfield is already attracting launch partners.  Liquid restaking protocol Renzo, known primarily for its work on Ethereum-based restaking projects including EigenLayer and Symbiotic, disclosed Wednesday that it's preparing to launch a SOL derivative token, called ezSOL, that offers holders exposure to Jito’s yield-generating infrastructure, plus the extra tokens generated by staking and restaking.  It’s a change of pace for one of the established players of EigenLayer’s pioneering restaking ecosystem. Renzo’s ezETH is among the Ethereum world’s biggest liquid restaking tokens: It takes users’ ETH or ETH liquid staking tokens and “restakes” them with certain blockchain apps to provide a measure of economic security, generating interest along the way.  The same general principles will apply in Jito’s upcoming restaking protocol, said Renzo founding contributor Lucas Kozinski, albeit with some different verbiage. EigenLayer refers to blockchain apps secured via restaking as “actively validated services,” or AVSs, whereas Jito calls them Node Consensus Networks (NCNs).  “We think that restaking is going to be the largest DeFi segment, similar to how liquid staking grew, and because of the complexities associated with restaking, I think everybody focuses on the token, but they don't realize how much infrastructure needs to be run to essentially be able to secure AVSs and in Jito’s cases, NCNs,” Kozinski said.  How Renzo ezSOL works  Renzo’s ezSOL will work in close proximity to Jito’s own staking token, jitoSOL. Solana users who deposit SOL into Renzo will get back the ezSOL token, Kozinski said. Behind the scenes, Renzo will stake that underlying SOL with Jito to get jitoSOL, where it MEV rewards and gains exposure to the native yield of the Solana blockchain. Renzo will then restake that jitoSOL with NCNs.  Despite some similarities between Renzo’s liquid restaking setups on Ethereum and, soon, Solana, getting it all going is far more complicated than simply plugging the old system into the new. Solana follows an entirely different architecture than Ethereum and its apps are written in a different coding language.  Kozinski said he has hired Rust engineers to build smart contracts for ezSOL. A press release said those smart contracts will relay the value generated by restaking into the price of ezSOL. If all goes according to plan, ezSOL will trade in tandem with but slightly higher than SOL, much like Jito’s staking token, jitoSOL does.  Solana also has a different crypto culture than Ethereum. Its user base of crypto traders, stakers and borrowers crossover but hardly match up. Each chain has its share of partisans, some of whom believe this network or that is practically – sometimes even philosophically – superior to the other.  That dynamic helped doom other blockchain apps who tried to cross the cultural and technological chasm. Ethereum’s liquid staking leader Lido once tried to challenge Solana’s resident staking services and gain dominance on both chains. It failed and in February retreated.  That makes Renzo – a name brand only in the Ethereum restaking world – a somewhat unlikely candidate for success on Solana. It isn’t abandoning its Ethereum product, but it is betting expansion to another has more potential than staying put.  Kozinski is nevertheless insistent that Renzo can make it work. He said his team is culturally similar to Jito’s and can align in ways that incentivize activity. He also pointed out that Renzo is not working alone. Its product feeds directly into Jito, one of the Solana’s most successful startups to date.  “Ethereum users might be interested in using Solana. Solana users might be interested in using Ethereum. But the bigger play here is growing the Renzo user base and bring in that expertise that we've developed over the past year, building on top of EigenLayer,” he said.",POSITIVE,ETH | SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SOL | SPONSORED | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/08/14/as-restaking-takes-shape-on-solana-ethereum-focused-renzo-jumps-in-with-ezsol,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1f4ea452e85fa81c150bf430e79056a922efa495-960x540.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

32407044,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635363,1723645852,Brace For Impact: Render Poised For A Staggering 990% Surge — Analysts,"In a market with divergent projections, the Render token warms up to analysts and crypto believers. At a present value of $4.80, cryptocurrency researcher Crypto Patel has predicted Render is going to skyrocket over 990% to as high as $50. This could happen despite the token having plunged 75% from its peak. Related Reading: Helium (HNT) Surges 48% — Here’s What’s Fueling The Rally Conversely, Crypto Alex found Render charts contained a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern that could trigger a significant rally once sellers lose momentum. With these two diverging views, Render is at a junction, making its future interesting. Key Support And Buy Zones Moreover, the analysis is not based entirely on Patel’s optimistic price target. He has been able to identify crucial buying zones for the investors. The entry point, according to him, near $4-$3.5 and $2-$1.7, may turn out to be a prospective upsurge of the token. RNDR/USDT Bullish Analysis Toward $50 🚀$RNDR has taken a hit, dropping 75% from its recent peak, but it’s now trading around $4.58 and has made a strong recovery from the $3 support level. Key Buying Zones: Entry 1: $4 – $3.5 Entry 2: $2 – $1.7 Target: $50 If RNDR can hold… pic.twitter.com/ytL5mul0U0 — Crypto Patel (@CryptoPatel) August 13, 2024 However, Patel said that more emphasis is given to the $3 support level. If the token is able to stay above this barrier, then that would indicate a strong uptrend. If below, then optimal purchasing zones may need to be $4. Render: Bearish Signs RNDR has its downsides. A closer look at technical indications suggests caution. The 1-Day chart suggests ongoing bearishness. The Keltner Channels indicator shows Render’s price below the middle line foreshadowing negative momentum. The price commonly touches or hangs near the bottom band that indicates strong selling pressure. Now, a low reading of 34.16 RSI, below the neutral 50, is actually a point of concern. With an RSI below 30, bearish momentum can continue, although oversold conditions could finally lead to a rebound. Chaikin Money Flow comes in at -0.05, indicating only a slight capital outflow. This means that, even while sellers have a very slight advantage, the situation is not radically extreme. Bullish Pattern Render charts spell out a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, according to Crypto Alex. A trend change might be happening here due to the pattern that started in early August. The left shoulder, the head as the low, and then the right shoulder all form the inverse head and shoulders, all higher compared to the head. $RENDER bottom is in 🚨 A breakout above $5.2 and RENDER will moon 🚀 pic.twitter.com/ERdQ0SP6Z9 — AMCrypto (@AMCryptoAlex) August 10, 2024 The neckline of this pattern comes in just below $5.2 and is important. A clear break above this resistance level could see prices higher. Render has rebuffed this level previously, but higher lows suggest buying pressure. The token breaking the $5.2 resistance might see it rise further and hit Patel’s lofty target. Related Reading: Celestia (TIA) Gains 14% Following Network Upgrade Announcement Render Token finds itself at a crossroads with differing forecasts from analysts. Crypto Patel sees a parabolic move up to $50 despite recent drops, outlining key buying zones and the need to hold above $3. Crypto Alex, on his end, has pointed to what could be a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. To that regard, he noted that if RNDR broke above $5.2, a huge rise could be witnessed. Both analysts have put forward very interesting but contrasting views; therefore, RNDR’s next move will be important to watch.

The risk-reward for the shares is now skewed to the upside, the report said.  The probability of Hut 8 signing an HPC/AI customer in the near-term has increased, the broker said.  Hut 8 rose Wednesday after broker H.C. Wainwright upgraded the Bitcoin miner two steps to buy from sell.  The broker also raised its price target on the shares to $13.50 from $7.50. The stock rose for the first time in four days, adding as much as 5.6%, and was recently trading 3.7% higher around $11.36.  The broker gave four reasons for its positive shift in sentiment, among them that Hut 8 now benefits from ""competitive blended average electricity costs"" following the restructuring of its newest facility in Texas.  The miner also has the ""capital and the infrastructure in place to purchase and deploy the latest-gen mining equipment at an opportune time in the cycle,"" analysts Mike Colonnese and Dylan Scales wrote.

32406788,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635463,1723645447,1000X Your Wealth With Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE),"The cryptocurrency market is no stranger to stories of immense wealth creation, where a small investment can turn into a life-changing fortune. As 2024 unfolds, two meme coins are capturing the imagination of investors with the potential to 1000X their wealth: Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). These two tokens are not just riding the wave of meme culture; they are also leveraging unique technologies and strategies that set them apart from the crowded field. Here’s why Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) might be the keys to multiplying your wealth in the coming months. Pepe Unchained: Leveraging Layer-2 for Exponential Growth Pepe Unchained (PEPU) is not your average meme coin. While most meme coins rely heavily on their cultural appeal and viral potential, Pepe Unchained goes a step further by integrating Ethereum’s Layer-2 technology. This integration is a game-changer, allowing Pepe Unchained to offer faster, more cost-effective transactions than traditional meme coins. The use of Layer-2 significantly reduces transaction fees, which have been a major barrier to the mass adoption of Ethereum-based tokens. As of mid-August 2024, Pepe Unchained (PEPU) has raised over $8.4 million in its presale, demonstrating strong investor confidence and market interest. This impressive fundraising achievement is a clear indicator that Pepe Unchained (PEPU) is on the radar of serious crypto investors who see its potential for exponential growth. What makes Pepe Unchained (PEPU) particularly exciting is its roadmap for the future. The project plans to launch a full-scale ecosystem that goes beyond just being a meme coin.

By building an ecosystem that provides real utility, Pepe Unchained is positioning itself for sustained growth, making it a strong contender for those looking to 1000X their investment. Mpeppe: The Next Big Meme Coin with Viral Potential While Pepe Unchained (PEPU) focuses on combining technology with meme culture, Mpeppe (MPEPE) taps into the raw power of virality. Mpeppe (MPEPE) designed to capture the essence of what makes meme coins so appealing: community-driven growth, social media buzz, and the potential for rapid, exponential returns. Currently, in its third stage of presale, Mpeppe has already raised over $935,892, with more than 64.85% of its tokens sold. Mpeppe (MPEPE) stands out in the meme coin space by actively engaging with its community through social media campaigns, influencer partnerships, and viral marketing strategies. These efforts are designed to create a strong, loyal community that can drive the token’s value higher. As we’ve seen with other successful meme coins, a dedicated community can be the difference between a token that fades into obscurity and one that skyrockets in value. One of the unique aspects of Mpeppe (MPEPE) is its plan to launch a series of themed NFTs that will be integrated into the broader Mpeppe (MPEPE) ecosystem. These NFTs will not only serve as collectibles but will also offer utility within the Mpeppe (MPEPE) platform, such as access to exclusive events, voting rights in community decisions, and more. By adding this layer of functionality, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is creating additional value for its holders, which could drive demand and push the token’s price higher. PEPU and MPEPE: A Strategic Duo Investing in both Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a balanced approach to wealth creation. While each token has its unique strengths, together they provide a comprehensive investment strategy that leverages both technological innovation and the viral potential of meme culture. Pepe Unchained (PEPU) provides a solid foundation with its advanced Layer-2 technology, ensuring that transactions are fast and affordable. This makes Pepe Unchained (PEPU) a long-term play with the potential for sustained growth as its ecosystem expands. On the other hand, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers the explosive growth potential that comes with being a meme coin with a strong community and viral appeal. By holding both Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Mpeppe, investors can benefit from the stability and innovation of PEPU while also capturing the high-reward potential of MPEPE. This strategic combination allows investors to diversify their risk while maximizing their chances of achieving significant returns. Conclusion: Seize the Opportunity to 1000X Your Wealth The crypto market is full of opportunities, but few offer the potential for returns as massive as Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). With their unique approaches to technology and community engagement, these tokens are well-positioned to deliver the kind of exponential gains that can truly transform your financial future.

A new PM and government is to come into place and that may impact implementation of crypto related policies.  Thailand Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin's shock removal from office by a court on Wednesday may not impact crypto rules in the nation, even if some policy implementations may be affected, experts told CoinDesk.  After the verdict, Thavisin said he was unsure whether the next government would continue with his policies, CNN reported. He was removed by The Constitutional Court in Bangkok for breaching ethics rules by appointing a lawyer who had served prison time to the Cabinet.  The ruling Pheu Thai-led coalition will need to nominate a new prime minister, who will be subsequently be voted on by the 500-seat parliament, as a new government comes into place. It is unclear how crypto-related policies could be impacted by this specifically.  ""The removal of PM Srettha will have minimal impact on digital asset regulations,"" said Tanawat Sutunthivorakoon, the CEO of Bitazza Thailand.  Sanjay Popli, Chief Executive Officer of Cryptomind Advisory and the co-Founder of Cryptomind said ""It's unlikely that the new Prime Minister will have significantly different views on cryptocurrency, given that the ruling party, Pheu Thai, remains in power.""  Last week, the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched a sandbox for crypto-related businesses. Sutunthivorakoon said the SEC has ""consistently supported"" the crypto industry for the ""past six years irrespective"" of the ruling party in parliament.  Thailand features 10th in Chainalysis' 2023 Global Crypto Adoption Index Top 20 and several crypto exchanges have been issued licenses there.  For some time now, the nation and its regulators have been attempting to find the balance between supporting the crypto ecosystem and preventing fraud. It has allowed institutional investors and very high-net-worth individuals to invest in crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) but it has also said custodians need to have a contingency plan if something goes wrong.  Nares Laopannarai, the President of Digital Asset Association of Thailand said overall crypto regulations should remain unaffected but ""PM Strettha's originally proposed Digital Wallet Policy,"" will likely be impacted.  The launch of a Digital Wallet Policy to stimulate the economy earlier this month has already seen ""25 million registrations,"" according to Laopannarai. The policy includes a 10,000-baht (approx 285 USD) handout upon registration.  ""This initiative ... may face delays or revisions or even cancelation due to the recent developments,"" Laopannarai said.  Popli said the recent appointment of a new SEC director has helped the make the landscape ""increasingly"" clear and the Sandbox ""underscores the country’s commitment to fostering innovation while ensuring robust oversight.""

Bitcoin Price Boost Is Incoming In his latest research note, Thielen explains the critical importance of monitoring and analyzing crypto money flows, which provide crucial insights into market conditions that can either accelerate or inhibit Bitcoin’s price movements. “Traders are often caught off guard by price crashes, overlooking the critical signals these flows offer. However, the inverse is also true; a sustained increase in money flows can drive higher prices, but many also miss these indicators,” Thielen writes. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Action “Boring” Despite Rapid Accumulation: Is Something Big Cooking? The researcher explains that money flows can predict price movements in both directions. In April 2024, signaled a price correction as “broad money flows largely paused.” Thielen adds, “a resurgence in certain money flows helped lift prices as markets approached bottoms. The critical factor was monitoring the sustainability of these flows, as rallies often lost momentum without continued support.” The report highlights the most recent activities involving major stablecoin issuers. Thielen points out that last night, Tether minted $1 billion in USDT, categorizing it as an inventory build rather than immediate market issuance. This distinction is essential as it suggests a preparatory step for potential future market actions rather than immediate liquidity injection. Moreover, the researcher details an important observation regarding recent issuances by Tether and Circle, which cumulatively amount to nearly $2.8 billion. Thielen interprets this as a strong indication of institutional investors deploying fresh capital into the crypto market, which historically signals bullish conditions for Bitcoin. “If this trend of issuance (not just minting) continues, Bitcoin could see further gains,” remarks Thielen. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Altcoin Bull Run Will Return, Arthur Hayes Reveals Timeline Further supporting Thielen’s analysis, the on-chain analysis platform Lookonchain reported yesterday via X: “Tether Treasury minted 1B USDT on Ethereum again 20 mins ago. Over the past year, a total of 32B USDT has been minted by Tether Treasury!” Additionally, Lookonchain may have found a reason for the large issuance of new stablecoins. The firm found that substantial amounts of USDT flowed to Cumberland. They remarked, “In just 8 days, Cumberland has injected 1.04B USDT into the crypto market! An hour ago, Cumberland received 141.5M USDT from Tether Treasury again and transferred it to major exchanges such as Kraken, OKX, Binance, and Coinbase.” More Bullish Catalysts Crypto analyst Miles Deutscher delivered another reason to be bullish on Bitcoin via X. He noted the current market conditions resemble the multi-month consolidation from 2023, suggesting a potential end to this phase based on similar chart formations and a sharp decline in retail interest. “This feels eerily similar to August-October last year. Retail interest is evaporating fast (YT views have fallen off a cliff over the past week). Apathy amongst existing market participants. Lack of clear narratives (and the #Bitcoin price action looks identical too),” Deutscher stated. Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, added a macroeconomic perspective, noting the expansion of the global money supply as a historical driver for rising Bitcoin prices. “Global money supply is exploding up. Plus, we just broke out of a massive 4-year consolidation. What do you think this means for Bitcoin?” he posed rhetorically, suggesting a bullish outlook based on this factor. At press time, BTC traded at $60,853.

The Consumer Price Index rose 0.2% in July, according to a U.S. government report Wednesday morning. That's up from a decline of 0.1% in June and against expectations for 0.2%. On a year-over-year basis, the CPI was higher by 2.9% versus 3% expected and 3% in June.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 1,961 +3.2% Bitcoin (BTC): $61,384 +4.4% Ether (ETH): $2,754 +4.3% S&P 500: 5,434.43 +1.7% Gold: $2,513 +1.9% Nikkei 225: 36,442.43 +0.58%  Top Stories  Bitcoin topped $61,000, reversing some of its losses from the steep drop at the start of August. BTC has risen more than 4% in the last 24 hours, outperforming the broader crypto market, which has increased just over 2%, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index. Despite the gains, some trading funds remain cautious amid a busy week for data, warning of possible short-term tremors that could impede the rally. “Investors remain cautious ahead of US CPI this week,” crypto trading firm QCP Capital said in a Telegram broadcast. “They will closely watch inflation numbers for guidance on whether the Fed will cut rates by 50 or 25 bps in September. The odds are now evenly split.”  Goldman Sachs holds positions in seven of the 11 U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETFs, totaling over $400 million. Its largest holding is BlackRock's IBIT at $238.6 million, followed by Fidelity's FBTC at $79.5 million, then $56.1 million of Invesco Galaxy's BTCO, according to its quarterly 13-F report. During CoinDesk's Consensus 2024 festival in Austin, Mathew McDermott, the bank's global head of digital assets, said the BTC ETFs were a ""big psychological turning point"" for the industry. ""The bitcoin ETF obviously has been an astonishing success,"" McDermott said on stage. Goldman Sachs' digital asset desk is primarily focused on the digitization of assets.  Coinbase appears to be developing a version of wBTC to run on its layer-2 blockchain Base. Speculation was sparked by cryptic posts from Coinbase late Tuesday U.S. time. The posts contained the wording: ""cbBTC"" and ""Coming soon."" They were followed by a post from Jesse Pollak, who runs Base, saying how the team plans to build a ""massive bitcoin economy"" on the network. Wrapping a crypto token is a way of making it available on protocols other than the one it was originally designed for, bringing increased liquidity to the target ecosystem.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows bitcoin dominance – the percentage of the total crypto market that BTC accounts for – over the last 12 months.  Its current level above 57% is the highest since March 2021.  This reflects the positive tailwinds such as ETF approval and the halving event in the face of challenging market conditions.

Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said during an interview on CNBC that crypto is already a ""purple,"" or bipartisan issue, but more needs to be done to solidify this status, or the U.S. will miss the opportunity to lead in this space.  ""What's interesting is that if you look at what happened over the past year, you actually saw a lot of bipartisan work getting done. Crypto, in many ways, has been treated as a bipartisan issue for quite some time,"" he said. ""You saw major bills in stablecoin, major bills in market structure advancing, and so it looked like this was a purple issue.""  Allaire is one of the many voices calling for bipartisanship on crypto. In a recent interview with CoinDesk, Paul Grewal, Coinbase's Chief Legal Officer, said that technology should transcend the political divide.  While some bipartisan work has been done to advance legislation, Allaire also criticized the current administration for missing opportunities to lead in the crypto industry, arguing that its policies have driven jobs overseas, stifled innovation, and left crucial decisions to the courts instead of Congress.  ""They've made the cost of building in this space extremely prohibitive,"" he said. ""That is not how a new technology industry should be developed. They've really missed the beat on that.""  Allaire said that this lack of leadership has caused the U.S. to fall behind other regions, such as Europe, which have moved ahead with comprehensive regulation.  ""I think what the industry is looking for is clear statements, from the existing White House, and clear statements from Harris as part of her economic policy agenda,"" he said, noting that the Harris campaign has been reaching out to the industry to learn more about the asset class.  But does former President Trump have all the answers? In late July, the Republican candidate made an appearance at the BTC 2024 conference in Nashville, but has not said much on the issue since. During a recent X space interview between Trump and Elon Musk, the asset class went unmentioned.  Allaire mentioned that while Trump himself might not have a deep grasp of the issues, ""what does seem clear is that a lot of the people around him and his advisers have a somewhat sophisticated view on the topic.""  While the crypto community has speculated that Trump might support some bold moves, such as making Bitcoin a reserve currency, Allaire seemed doubtful about the likelihood of Trump's commitment to such ideas.

Pump.Fun recently eliminated the $2 fee for token creation, shifting this cost to the first buyer of the token which led to an explosion in token creation and complaints.  Token generator Pump.Fun raked $5.3 million in daily fees, a lifetime record, to become the highest-grossing platform in the crypto market, ahead of more prominent protocols and entire blockchains.  The silver went to Ethereum's staking application Lido which was far behind Pump with a relatively smaller fee of $2.3 million. Blockchains Ethereum, Tron and Solana made less than $1.3 million each, data tracked by DefiLlama shows.  Pump lets anyone issue a token for around $2 worth of Solana’s SOL in capital, after which they choose the number of tokens, theme, and a meme picture to go along. When the market capitalization of any token reaches $69,000, a portion of liquidity is deposited to the Solana-based exchange Raydium and burned.  Developers dropped the $2 issuance fee earlier this week – sparking the equivalent of a digital firework of creators. As of Wednesday, the fee is now paid by the first buyer – usually trading bots or an automated service – of any token created on Pump. The creator also now receives 0.5 SOL if the coin completes its bonding curve and is listed on Raydium.  Over 10,000 tokens were created in a single three-hour period on Tuesday, propelling Pump’s revenues to $5 million from under $900,000 on Monday and Tuesday. This bump came after the creator fees were dropped.  Market watchers, however, expressed dismay at the decision.  “Nobody is having fun anymore besides the pump fun team raking in fees,” said @anon_rip in an X post. “How is this a good thing anymore?”  “Not entertaining watching things go to zero in seconds,” said @Vertwashere, referring to the brisk creation of new tokens that plunge in value after initial buying activity in the first few minutes. “Nobody is entertained but ur team and your pockets,” @CookerFlips, another X user, said.  As CoinDesk previously reported, Pump's quick token creation means tens of thousands of tokens have likely been issued since its March launch. However, only a few have reached more than $10 million in market capitalization.",NEGATIVE,SOL,ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SOL | RAY,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/14/pumpfuns-removal-of-2-issuance-charge-pushes-daily-fees-to-all-time-highs-but-users-are-unhappy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ea6187d940e314472851cc8a6cf23332109672ee-6000x3375.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Though the market is still highly unpredictable, a tendency for consolidation and holding on to gains is slowly showing up. Related Reading: Helium (HNT) Surges 48% — Here’s What’s Fueling The Rally Crypto Tony recently commented that a break above could show the beginning of a new uptrend, referring to $58,300 as the key resistance level. The most recent data from Glassnode makes a move in this direction, which indicates that though the price of Bitcoin remains highly unstable, key players may be preparing for a new phase of accumulation. This comes after a spell of distribution that has been going on for several periods to wallets of all sizes. Following the all-time high of bitcoin back in March, investors sold their holdings for quite a while. However, it now appears that this trend is reversing and for the larger wallets often affiliated with exchange-traded funds. Major entities seem to once again start hoarding Bitcoin en masse—a potentially optimistic sign for the crypto’s future. Bitcoin Long-Term Owners Change Course The behavior of long-term holders is also changing course. LTHs are showing a renewed propensity to hang onto their assets after selling during the ATH run-up. In the past three months alone, more than 374,000 BTC have changed into LTH status. That means a large portion of investors are choosing to hold rather than sell, and it might just be the development to prop Bitcoin’s price in the upcoming months. Bitcoin accumulation now sits at 1.0 of the Accumulation Trend Score (ATS), which measures the weighted balance globally—thanks to high buying in the past month, particularly from long-term holders. These holders were previously in a so-called “phase distribution”; it seems things have changed. Their newfound interest in Bitcoin holdings could mean that confidence in the market is rising. Spot Price Continues To Be Above Critical Level Another positive is that the current price of bitcoin has continued to remain above the Active Investor Cost Basis (AICB). This measure for active coins indicates the average purchase cost. On a spot basis, remaining above this level does appear to be a strong indication of the market, even considering the aggressive distribution from April to July. It seems that investors are riding the brisk momentum that may shortly ensue and are preparing for an upward trend. $BTC / $USD – Update Weekly above $58,300 is the main goal for the bulls this week. Could provide a good base if we get it pic.twitter.com/CeSUHqDmSa — Crypto Tony (@CryptoTony__) August 13, 2024 Key Long-Term Level Of Resistance To Watch From a macro perspective, Bitcoin approaches a make-or-break level. Analysts have called $58,300 as a key level to watch. Crypto Tony commented that if Bitcoin were able to close above this resistance, it would be the start of something more interesting. In other words, this resistance level would present itself as an important obstacle to overcome, and if it does, tremendous buying pressure would likely ensue.

Users will be able to make purchases directly with their USDC, USDT and wETH assets held on the layer-2 network Linea.  MetaMask, the popular self-custodial crypto wallet for the Ethereum {{ETH}} network, is starting the rollout of its blockchain-based debit card developed with payments giant Mastercard (MA) and crypto payments specialist Baanx.  The MetaMask Card will initially be available in a ""limited pilot of a few thousand digital-only cards"" to users based in the European Union countries and the UK, Metamask told CoinDesk on Wednesday. The company plans broader distribution later this year, with a ""full rollout"" in the EU and UK and more pilot launches in other regions through the coming quarters.  The offering comes as traditional financial services and blockchain-based digital assets are getting increasingly intertwined. As global institutions tokenize old-school instruments like bonds and credit and asset managers start offering bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} exchange-traded funds, payments giants are exploring ways to implement blockchain tech into financial rails.  Mastercard has been working with Baanx on its web3 payments initiative, connecting traditional payments with crypto platforms like hardware wallet firm Ledger and decentralized exchange 1inch. Rival company Visa (V), meanwhile, has partnered with Circle's USDC stablecoin and the Solana {{SOL}} network to speed up cross-border payments.  CoinDesk broke the news in March that MetaMask was testing a blockchain-based payment card with Mastercard and Baanx.  Read more: With Mastercard, MetaMask Tests First Blockchain-Powered Payment Card  ""We saw a significant opportunity to make purchases for self-custody wallet users easier, more secure, and interoperable,"" said Raj Dhamodharan, executive vice president of blockchain and digital assets at Mastercard.  ""Anybody who has access to a mobile phone should be able to get access to a basic range of financial services by default,"" said Simon Jones, chief commercial officer at Baanx. ""This would have huge implications in countries with large numbers of unbanked or underbanked individuals.""  The card works like a typical debit card but allows purchases directly with digital asset holdings in Metamask's self-custodial wallet. This means that users retain custody of their funds until the moment of payment.  Users will be able to spend their USDC, USDT and wETH cryptocurrencies held on the Linea blockchain, an Ethereum layer-2 network developed by Consensys, which is also the developer of MetaMask.  “This gives people more freedom to spend their assets; in this case, crypto,” said Lorenzo Santos, senior product manager at Consensys.

TON Ventures announced its formation on Wednesday, led by Ian Wittkopp, the former director of TON Accelerator, and Inal Kardan, former gaming lead at TON Foundation.  The organization has already raised $40 million and plans to invest in early stage consumer applications in the TON ecosystem with ""mass appeal,"" the press release said. The investors in the fund are ""mainly [composed] of individual, private investors, who want to support the long-term growth of the TON ecosystem,"" the founders told CoinDesk in an email.  The TON ecosystem has seen a rapid rise in popularity recently, with web3 games such as Hamster Kombat and Notcoin attracting many millions of users. These apps are built on top of The Open Network, or TON, a decentralized layer-1 blockchain originally developed by Telegram, but continued as an independent operation due to regulatory concerns after Telegram settled a lawsuit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2020.  Digital asset investment firm Pantera Capital said earlier this year that it made its largest investment in its history in TON, and was reportedly raising funds for a second investment round.

32399696,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635312,1723633253,Bitcoin Poised To Reach New All-Time Highs: Expert Dives Into Tether’s Role As The Key,"The Bitcoin (BTC) price has broken free from its recent consolidation phase, breaching the $60,000 mark and setting its sights on critical resistance levels essential for propelling the cryptocurrency to new all-time highs (ATHs). This surge comes amid emerging bullish momentum in the world’s largest digital asset. However, the key to continuing this breakout is the influential role of Tether (USDT), the largest stablecoin in the crypto ecosystem. USDT Minting Could Propel Bitcoin Beyond $73,700? According to technical analysts, such as Doctor Profit, the continuous minting of USDT by its issuer could be the decisive factor that pushes Bitcoin to surpass its previous record high of $73,700 reached in March this year. Related Reading: Cardano Is Not ‘Dead’: Crypto Analyst Predicts Surge To $5 In a recent social media post, Doctor Profit highlighted the significance of Tether’s activities in the current Bitcoin price dynamics. Despite Bitcoin’s consolidation below the $60,000 mark over the past 48 hours, Doctor Profit noted that Tether has continued to print more USDT, with its market capitalization increasing by 13.6% since Bitcoin’s all-time high in March. “Usually, Tether market cap needs to drop in a bear market or strong correction,” Doctor Profit observed. “However, this move indicates that Tether is heavily printing during this sideways period for the next leg up. We now have $15 billion worth of USDT that has not been injected into the markets yet.” The analyst further pointed out that just today, an additional $1 billion in USDT was minted, suggesting that the crypto market seems to be ignoring this “bullish fact.” Doctor Profit concluded that Tether will ultimately “decide when to send BTC to a new ATH.” Inflation And CME Gaps Echoing this bullish analysis, crypto analyst Ali Martinez also noted that Bitcoin forms a symmetrical triangle pattern on the lower time frames. According to Martinez, a daily close outside the $59,000 range seen in the past 48 hours could trigger a spike of up to 4.8% for BTC. Currently, BTC is trading at $61,350, up only 2.8% in the last hours of Tuesday’s trading session. Adding to the bullish momentum, the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) data in the United States has come in lower than expected, suggesting that inflationary pressures may be easing more than anticipated. This, in turn, could influence the Federal Reserve’s decisions on interest rates, potentially leading to rate cuts that could ultimately benefit crypto assets. Related Reading: Strong Bearish Signal Appears In Solana Chart, Where Is Price Headed Next? Another analyst, Rekt Capital, also remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s recent price action, noting that the cryptocurrency’s most recent rebound has allowed it to re-fill the CME Gaps that were previously placed between $59,400 and $62,550. Rekt believes that building a support base within these CME gaps is crucial to establishing a bullish directional bias. It remains to be seen if these bullish signs can be sustained in the coming days and how high the BTC price can go.

42390606,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd4KDn,1723633200,Ethereum Set for Overhaul of Crucial Programming Standard With 'EVM Object Format',"The new EVM Object Format (EOF) proposal aims to make the de facto industry standard Ethereum Virtual Machine more developer-friendly.  Concerns were raised by some developers that the risk of implementing the proposal weren't worth the benefits.  Ethereum developers are steering toward an upgrade that could bring the most fundamental changes in the network's programming environment since the original smart-contracts blockchain shook up the crypto industry when it launched nearly a decade ago.  The Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) known as EVM Object Format (EOF), which has been discussed extensively in developer circles this year because of some participants' concerns about possible security risks, is now set to be included in a major package of changes expected later this year or early next, known as the Pectra hard fork.  The EOF proposal is a series of smaller changes aiming to update the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the programming environment that executes smart contracts on the blockchain, and arguably Ethereum’s secret sauce that made it different from Bitcoin and other early distributed networks when it launched in 2015.  Specifically, EOF would make smart contracts more developer friendly, especially for those building decentralized applications in Solidity or Vyper programming languages. The series of changes are incredibly delicate that can break existing smart contracts, so developers have added in a new version, allowing dapp builders to choose which version of the EVM to use when deploying their code.  “EOF will be the first major EVM related change in years,” said Parithosh Jayanthi, a core developer at the Ethereum Foundation, over a text message on Telegram to CoinDesk. “It sets the stage for future upgrades to the EVM and showcases the base layers intent to continue to improving the EVM.”  The EVM standard  As the first and largest smart-contract blockchain, Ethereum has defined the programming standard that many other blockchains have adopted. Other layer-1 blockchains have also found ways to be compatible with the EVM, recognizing how important this piece of technology is in the blockchain industry.  But developers are now looking to introduce a newer version of the EVM, so they can write more secure smart contracts and dapps. With this, some developers have a few concerns that the procedure might create some unintended consequences for the network.  Currently, the EOF component of the Pectra upgrade, Ethereum’s next hard fork, consists of 11 Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs).  EOF proposals were suggested in the previous upgrade, Dencun, but when Ethereum developers wanted to be heads-down working on proto-danksharding – another crucial innovation that makes data storage on the blockchain cheaper and faster – they pushed EOF out and suggested to revisit it for Pectra.  One notable critic of EOF was the core developer Marius Van Der Wijden.  “The problem that I see is that now performing these operations, performing these verifications, these checks, is also part of the consensus,"" he told CoinDesk in an interview at the Ethereum Community Conference in Brussels. ""That means if there's a bug in there, and we deploy something that passes our verification, but has a bug in it, then it will later on crash in a very unexpected way.”  Van Der Wijden’s high-level concern with EOF is that “the big disadvantage that we will have is to maintain this EVM alongside the old one. Because the old one is not going to go anywhere, right? And everyone has sort of been making use of the old one.”  Most of the core developers, however, say that EOF will bring benefits to the Ethereum ecosystem that outweigh the risks.  “EOF is ready, implementations are complete, and downstream users such as Solidity are advocating for it,” Danno Ferrin, an independent contributor to the client team Besu, told CoinDesk in a message over Telegram.  “When the feature is ready and done it's time to ship it or to permanently mothball it. EOF also fixes a large amount of technical debt the EVM has had since its inception,” Ferrin said.

Particularly, according to Matrixport’s recent report, Ethereum is now displaying greater price fluctuations compared to Bitcoin in the past weeks. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Gains Strength, Outpaces Bitcoin With An 8% Surge Ethereum’s Volatile Outpacing Bitcoin’s Volatility measures the price variations of an asset over time, with higher volatility indicating more significant price changes. According to data from Matrixport, the 30-day realized volatility spread between ETH and Bitcoin typically ranges from 1.0 to 1.5. #Matrixport 📈Today-Aug 13: #Ethereum’s Volatility Surpasses #Bitcoin’s#Cryptoassets #cryptomarket #BTC #ETH pic.twitter.com/QoKsuLUrAH — Matrixport Official English (the only official X) (@Matrixport_EN) August 13, 2024 This means that Ethereum’s price movements have been up to 50% more erratic than that of Bitcoin, suggesting that Ethereum may offer a riskier market for investors. This increased volatility is evident in the way Ethereum reacts to market stimuli. Over recent weeks, Ethereum has shown volatility levels higher than Bitcoin. This distinction has become particularly notable since the onset of the latest bull market, with Ethereum’s price experiencing more drastic shifts. These rapid changes can significantly impact investment strategies, as Ethereum’s larger peaks and troughs present different risk and reward scenarios compared to the relatively more stable Bitcoin. Matrixport noted in the report: Due to Ethereum’s underperformance since the start of this bull market, this higher volatility has made it a less appealing asset. However, as long as the volatility ratio stays within this range, buying Ethereum volatility at the lower end could present an attractive opportunity. Bitcoin And Ethereum Performance Meanwhile, over the week, both assets appear to be almost mirroring each other in price performance, with BTC rising by 7.5% and ETH by 7.9%. However, there has been a noticeable difference in the performance of the past 24 hours. Over this period, Bitcoin has surged by 2.8% to reclaim its $61,000 price mark. On the other hand, Ethereum has increased by only 1.2%, reclaiming its price mark above $2,700. Related Reading: Is Now the Time to Buy Bitcoin?

32396212,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635232,1723626058,"Bitcoin ETFs Are “Important, But Not The Drivers,” On-Chain Analyst Argues","An on-chain analyst has explained why the Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), although important, may be something other than the drivers in the market. Bitcoin Spot ETFs Compared With Other Capital Flows On The Network In a new post on X, on-chain analyst Checkmate has discussed how the different capital flows in and out of Bitcoin stack up against each other. The first netflow of interest is naturally the total capital netflow itself. This netflow is calculated using the Realized Cap indicator. The Realized Cap is a capitalization model for BTC that calculates the asset’s total valuation by assuming that the “real” price of any coin in circulation was the price at which it was last moved on the network. The last transaction of any token was likely the last time it changed hands, so the price at its time would make up for its current cost basis. As the Realized Cap essentially sums up the cost basis of every coin in circulation, it tells us about the amount of capital the investors have used to purchase the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Only 66% Of Ethereum Holders In Profit Despite 21% Price Jump Therefore, the changes in this metric would reflect the incoming or outgoing capital from the sector. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows how the monthly version of this netflow has looked like for Bitcoin during the past year. As the graph shows, the change in the Bitcoin Realized Cap has been positive for almost this period, suggesting that a net amount of fresh capital has only been flowing into the asset. Currently, BTC is observing net inflows worth $12 billion per month. Checkmate has also attached the data for the flows related to the spot ETFs in the same chart. The green curve represents the monthly change for the ETFs excluding GBTC, while the red one corresponds to the GBTC outflows. The former stands at a positive $3.7 billion per month, while the latter is at a negative $0.93 billion per month. The capital flows related to these financial instruments don’t make up for anywhere near most of the market. “At best, the ETFs are 20% of the influence,” notes the analyst. “They are important, but not the driver.” The final metric in the chart is related to the supply change of the Bitcoin long-term holders (LTHs), who are the investors holding onto their coins since more than 155 days ago. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Participate In $588 Million Selloff: Is There More To Come? It would appear that these HODLers had been selling earlier in the year. Still, recently, their supply change has again flipped into positive territory, with their combined balance now growing at a rate of $1.6 billion per month. BTC Price In a sharp move up, Bitcoin has recovered beyond the $61,300 mark during the past day.

42390611,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd4KTB,1723625244,"Coinbase Promotes cbBTC, Wrapped Bitcoin Alternative for Base Blockchain","Posts on X from Coinbase and Base creator Jesse Pollak suggest the crypto exchange is developing a wrapped bitcoin similar to BitGo's wBTC to run on the layer-2 blockchain.  Despite some controversy over wBTC, BitGo's protocol remains stable.  Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) appears to be developing an alternative to BitGo's wrapped bitcoin wBTC {{WBTC}} to run on its own layer-2 blockchain, Base, to provide users a way of accessing the largest cryptocurrency by market value on the network.  Speculation was sparked by cryptic posts from Coinbase late Tuesday U.S. time. The posts contained the wording: ""cbBTC"" and ""Coming soon.""  They were followed by a post from Jesse Pollak, who runs Base, saying how the team plans to build a ""massive bitcoin economy"" on the network.  Wrapping a crypto token is a way of making it available on protocols other than the one it was originally designed for, bringing increased liquidity to the target ecosystem. Each wrapped bitcoin represents one of the original, which is stored in custody. When a trader wants to redeem the wrapped token for bitcoin, the wrapped version is ""burnt,"" or deleted from the chain, and the original is released.  Coinbase's announcement comes as a cloud hangs over wBTC. Earlier the month, BitGo said it was establishing a joint venture with BiT Global, a Hong Kong-registered custody platform partially owned by the Tron ecosystem and Tron founder Justin Sun. The venture, it said, will continue to use the same BitGo multisignature technology and deep cold storage.  The response to the announcement was generally neutral because there is no technical change to the product and all data about underlying reserves continues to be verifiable on-chain. Some chatter on the forums of DAI stablecoin issuer MakerDAO, however, expressed a negative reaction. An executive proposal for MakerDAO token holders proposes to stop wBTC borrowing and cut wBTC debt limits to 0 DAI to reduce risk is open for the next month.  Still, on-chain data from Dune shows there has been no change in supply for wBTC, meaning traders aren't trying to exit the protocol en-masse.  In a post on X, Sun said that there will be ""no changes to WBTC"" outside of the joint venture and he does not control the protocol's private keys and cannot move any of the BTC reserves.  ""My personal involvement in WBTC is entirely strategic,"" he wrote.

Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) ETF emerged as the 6th largest Bitcoin ETF by AUM with the lowest expense ratio of 0.15%. As the market for spot Bitcoin ETFs matures, Grayscale Mini Trust is expected to grow and potentially become the third or fourth-largest Bitcoin ETF by AUM. On January 10th, 2024, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission [SEC] approved the first 11 Bitcoin Spot ETFs for trading. Prior to this date, many institutions were hesitant to create a Spot ETF other than the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ((BTC)) (GBTC). Ahead of this time, Grayscale dominated the cryptocurrency ETF sector with the expansive 2% expense ratio as they were the only game in town. Grayscale’s products ranged from Ethereum, Chainlink, Bitcoin, Ethereum Classic ETFs, the list goes on, some products publicly traded on the NYSE, while others are privately managed. Since January 10th, the eleven approved spot Bitcoin ETFs have siphoned over $10bn of assets away from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, likely due to the higher expense ratio. To combat this, Grayscale has done two things - lowered the original ETF expense ratio from 2% to 1.5% and split a portion of the original Bitcoin Trust to the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ((BTC)) ETF ( BTC ) with an expense ratio of 0.15%. This is the lowest of the ETFs to date, with many in the range of 0.2-0.25%, this leads me to believe that eventually the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ((BTC)) ETF will grow into the third or fourth-largest Bitcoin ETF by assets under management within the next 24 months. As an owner of the original Grayscale Bitcoin Trust since 2020, Grayscale provided me one share of BTC for every share of GBTC but a slightly over 10% of the price and capital gains free. Now, I am a holder of both GBTC and BTC, and I'm not adding at the moment unless the underlying drops below $50,000. If I were to add, I would add to BTC due to the lower expense ratio. I do foresee Bitcoin being a speculative asset for folks to hold now and into the next decade as volatility with fiat, inflationary currencies continue to get printed out of control. For this cycle, I have a peak price target for Bitcoin between $120,000 and $200,000 in mid-2025 with a retracement back to today’s prices as we enter 2026. About the ETF Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust is a Bitcoin spot ETFs that holds Bitcoin as its only underlying asset and thus trade in tandem with the price of Bitcoin, which at the time of writing is approximately $59,500. This is important to note as there are other ETFs that are Bitcoin-linked which may trade Futures Contracts or leveraged derivatives and for those seeking strictly Bitcoin Spot ETFs, I do not want you to get impacted by choosing the wrong ETF. Always read a prospectus and understand holdings and ETF objectives prior to investing. Current AUM of Bitcoin ETFs The original Grayscale Bitcoin Trust held over $28bn as of January 10th, 2024 prior to all the other ETFs being approved by the SEC. Since then, the top 3 ETFs have grown from $28bn to over $46bn. Those ranking 4th and below hold $3bn in under, starting with Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF with an expense ratio of 0.21%. Assets Under Management of Top 10 Bitcoin ETFs (TheBlock.co) The above graphic demonstrates how the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF has already emerged as the 6th largest bitcoin ETF based on assets under management ((AUM)), outpacing other ETF managers like Bitwise, VanEck and others but below BlackRock’s iShares and Fidelity. Current Expense Ratio of Bitcoin ETFs With the cheapest expense ratio of the top Bitcoin ETFs, many traders of bitcoin and long-term holders of Bitcoin ETFs will likely be drawn to the 0.15% of the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF. This ETF’s expense ratio outpaces everyone else by 0.04% and the majority of ETFs by 0.1-0.15% and the latest bigger Grayscale ETF by 1.35%. That said, I do not know how expense ratios will move down in the future as competition heats up. If Bitcoin ETF AUM continues to increase from the approximately $50bn, smaller funds may be willing to lower ratios to capture a larger share of the market, so this is something to track when this article ages. Bitcoin ETFs Ticker Name AUM ($B) Expense Ratio IBIT iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF 21.04 0.25% GBTC Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF 14.19 1.50% FBTC Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin 10.71 0.25% ARKB ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF 2.78 0.21% BITB Bitwise Bitcoin ETF 2.31 0.20% BTC Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust 1.88 0.15% HODL VanEck Bitcoin Trust 0.661 0.20% BTCO Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF 0.483 0.25% BRRR CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund 0.537 0.25% EZBC Franklin Bitcoin ETF 0.39 0.19% BTCW WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund 0.211 0.25% The Ease of Bitcoin ETFs Many crypto maximalists will note that investing in an ETF is silly, as the entire point of investing in crypto is to own your own assets, decentralized with no bank. Now that over 4% of Bitcoin is held by ETFs, and then provide paper, the system is doing the exact opposite of what the creation of bitcoin was intended to do - that said, Bitcoin, or cryptocurrency for that matter is not in a place where everyone wants to create different wallets or open separate brokerage accounts to access Bitcoin. Also, while there are places around the world where one can use bitcoin as a legitimate currency, most individuals only want exposure to Bitcoin for its speculative growth nature and add extra returns to their portfolio. Therefore, the Bitcoin ETFs are a perfect place to accomplish this as they trade like a normal stock or ETF would with the underlying asset being Bitcoin, allowing you to benefit from the spot price of the currency. Therefore, as more individuals get used to cryptocurrencies being a certain percentage of assets in one's portfolio, larger institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity may benefit as they have access to a large pool of assets already under management. Second, Grayscale due to its history in the sector or industry will benefit, and then many will likely select the Mini Trust as their preferred ETF as the expense ratio is cheapest. Thus, as assets continue to grow and the market for spot Bitcoin ETFs matures, I view Grayscale Mini Trust continuing to grow at a faster rate and take market share from the other ETFs. This will let BTC grow into the fourth-largest Bitcoin ETF by AUM easily, but may even take third place as folks continue to withdraw money from the larger Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ((BTC)). Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Assets Under Management (AUM (YCharts) Future price of Bitcoin As a firm believer that crypto should be at least a small percentage of one’s portfolio, I do hold a view on what bitcoin will do in the future. Many followers of bitcoin may have seen the Bitcoin Rainbow chart before, and even though it may be more qualitative than quantitative, I see a pattern approximately 12–18 months post halving cycles for bitcoin that I see as replicable for this current cycle (halving occurred in April 2024). Bitcoin Rainbow Chart ( Blockchaincenter ) For those unfamiliar with the Rainbow chart, it is a log plot versus time (non-log) where the rainbow colors represent a similar log trend just at a slightly different location on the y-axis. This log trend has been adjusted from peaks and troughs of previous cycles of bitcoin movement to show when bitcoin was or is currently under or overpriced. Today, the rainbow plot shows things are still at a relatively cheap price compared to what one should expect for this halving cycle. Based on previous cycles, the expected price should fall between $160k-$220k 12-18 months post halving, which occurred in April 2024. I have added a margin of safety for myself to be lower at $120k to $200k. With the price of bitcoin currently $59,500, I anticipate the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF to double or triple in price ($10.50-$15.75) between now and mid-2025, retracing back to current prices once we enter 2026. Conclusion The last few years for Bitcoin’s approval within the financial community has completely morphed, and for the average investor the ETFs are a phenomenal place to put a percentage of your portfolio if you are willing to take on the risk. It should be noted that Grayscale was the original ETF, and while it may not have traded at spot and had premiums to asset value, it attained a premium 2% expense ratio during that time and established a name for itself in the cryptocurrency community. This reputation should trickle down into the Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF and I anticipate as traders and investors look for the best place to park money, the Mini Trust ETF will grow. Since the SEC’s decision to approve the first 11 Bitcoin Spot ETFs, the battle for assets under management in the Bitcoin ETF space has been a competitive arena. The Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF has gained notoriety as the 6th largest Bitcoin ETF by assets under management and will likely continue to increase its market share as it has the lowest expense ratio to date. I do see an opportunity for other ETFs to try to compete with BTC’s lower expense ratio, especially if the entire market cap or percentage of Bitcoin held by ETFs increases, however until that happens, BTC is poised to grow into the fourth or third-largest ETF by assets under management. While I, personally, am not adding to BTC at the moment, in a larger pullback in the price of Bitcoin, I may continue to add to my BTC as it is the easiest way and cheapest way to manage in my Fidelity brokerage account. Based on the Bitcoin Rainbow chart, I could see the price of bitcoin going north of $120,000 resulting in a 2-3x of the current price of the ETF.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4714347-btc-future-top-3-bitcoin-etf?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/32395732.jpeg

This latest addition to Grayscale’s product suite allows investors to gain exposure to MKR, the utility and governance token underpinning the Ethereum-based MakerDAO ecosystem. Grayscale Expands Crypto Portfolio MakerDAO is an autonomous organization operating a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, providing users access to a permissionless, open stablecoin system and various other on-chain financial services. According to Tuesday’s announcement by the firm, through the Grayscale MakerDAO Trust, investors can now participate in the growth and development of the protocol’s MKR ecosystem. Related Reading: Cardano Is Not ‘Dead’: Crypto Analyst Predicts Surge To $5 “As demand for crypto exposure continues to grow, Grayscale is committed to expanding our suite of products and providing innovative investment opportunities,” said Rayhaneh Sharif-Askary, Grayscale’s Head of Product & Research. “The launch of the Grayscale MakerDAO Trust allows investors to experience the growth of the entire MakerDAO ecosystem, aiming to remove DeFi’s dependency on traditional finance infrastructure by providing a permissionless, decentralized, and open stablecoin system,” Sharif-Askary also stated. The new trust functions similarly to Grayscale’s other single-asset investment vehicles, with the fund solely invested in MKR tokens. The trust is now open for daily subscription by eligible individual and institutional accredited investors, providing them a convenient way to gain exposure to the MakerDAO protocol. This announcement comes on the heels of Grayscale’s recent launches of the Grayscale Bittensor Trust, dedicated to the TAO token supporting the Bittensor Protocol, and the Grayscale Sui Trust, focused on the SUI token underpinning the Sui Layer 1 blockchain. MKR Price Action Grayscale’s news sparked a spike in the MKR token, which hit an 8-month low of $1.7 on August 5 amid the broader market crash and global economic uncertainties that led to an increased sell-off. MKR is trading at $2.10, up nearly 6% in the last few hours, coupled with a 16% increase in trading volume in the 24-hour time frame, amounting to $124 million, indicating investor interest in the token’s prospects. Related Reading: Strong Bearish Signal Appears In Solana Chart, Where Is Price Headed Next? MKR must consolidate above the $2.06 level to further capitalize on this latest surge, as it has acted as a resistance wall for the token over the past few days before Tuesday’s bullish news on the MKR/USDT daily chart. This would be key for MKR’s future advances and the potential to surpass its next resistance barrier at $2.16. However, if there is a resurgence of demand and buying pressure for the token and the broader market, which can also contribute to MKR’s 10% surge last week, it would position MakerDAO’s native token to tackle its next resistance at $2.31, $2.42 and $2.73 on its way to reclaiming the $3 mark.

ASX’s statements were ""deceptive"" and ""this was a collective failure by the ASX Board and senior executives,"" said ASIC.  Australia's Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) has sued the country's largest market operator, ASX Limited, for allegedly making misleading statements about how its blockchain project to replace its aged Clearing House Electronic Subregister System (CHESS) was progressing, before revealing that it had cancelled the project, the regulator announced on Wednesday.  In Nov. 2022, ASX cancelled its planned blockchain system for settling trade after Accenture identified ""significant challenges"" with its design. The decision saw it write-down about A$250 million ($168 million) after several delays. After years of tests, ASX had announced in 2017 that by Q1 2020 it would migrate one of its core services to a blockchain-based system.  ASIC sued on Tuesday and has not yet determined what penalty it will be seeking, but the Australian Financial Review (AFR) reported that ASX faces a maximum penalty of more than $500 million Australian dollars. ($330 million).  “We recognize the significance and serious nature of these proceedings. We cooperated fully with ASIC’s investigation and are now carefully reviewing and considering the allegations,” ASX chief executive Helen Lofthouse said in a statement.  Calls for ASX chairman Damian Roche to resign have emerged.  ASIC alleged that ""ASX announcements on 10 February 2022 that the project remained 'on-track for go-live' in April 2023 and was 'progressing well' were misleading.""  These representations were ""deceptive"" because at the time of the announcements, the project was not on track to the plan.  ""ASX’s statements go to the heart of trust in the integrity of our markets. We believe this was a collective failure by the ASX Board and senior executives at the time,"" said ASIC Chair Joe Longo.  Longo said the project's ""critical importance was all the more reason ASX needed to ensure it told the Australian public the truth about how the project was tracking and whether it would be completed on time.""

42390621,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd4LIT,1723618876,Bitcoin Miner Capitulation and Record High Hashrate Point to Possible Price Bottom: CryptoQuant,"Miners are increasing their network hashrate despite a recent drop in bitcoin prices, signaling a positive sentiment after a capitulation event that has typically marked price bottoms.  A significant miner capitulation was observed with a spike in Bitcoin outflows to 19,000 BTC on August 5, the highest since March 18. This came as bitcoin's price touched $49,000, suggesting miners sold off to cover costs as profit margins tightened.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} miners are expanding their capacity again as network hashrate reached a fresh all-time high this week following a capitulation event, on-chain analysis firm CryptoQuant shared in a report with CoinDesk.  Network hashrate set a new record of 627 exahash per second on Tuesday, recovering from the 8.5% drawdown in early July. Such expansion comes despite a recent drop in bitcoin prices and record-low hash price – or the average revenue per amount of mining power – indicating positive sentiment among miners after a bout of selling in the past few months.  Hashrate refers to the computational power used by miners to mint new bitcoin and verify new transactions on the Bitcoin network. Millions of calculations are solved each second to ‘win’ new blocks, in a process broadly called mining.  “We may have seen a miner capitulation event last week as miner outflows spiked after prices touched $49,000,” CryptoQuant said. “Bitcoin daily miner outflows spiked to 19K BTC on August 5, the highest level since March 18.”  Miners are entities that supply computing power to any blockchain network in return for “rewards” in the form of BTC tokens. They typically sell bitcoin to keep operations afloat continually as running such systems is costly: Only five popular mining rigs were profitable in early July as prices floated around the $54,000 mark.  “Miners sold some Bitcoin as their average operating profit margins were squeezed to 25%, the lowest since January 22,” the firm added.  A miner capitulation event is typically seen near local bottoms for Bitcoin prices during bull markets.  Since 2023, a spike in miner outflows coincided with local bottoms in March 2023 after the Silicon Valley bank sell-off – and January 2024, the price correction following the bitcoin spot ETF launch in the U.S.  BTC trades just above $61,000 in Asian afternoon hours Wednesday, up 2.8% in the past 24 hours to lead gains among crypto majors.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/14/bitcoin-miner-capitulation-and-record-high-hashrate-points-to-possible-price-bottom-cryptoquant,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/14326e80e965d7da2dfb227d93379d0677984bdf-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

32392088,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635262,1723617011,"Bitcoin at $70K, Ethereum at $4K: Arthur Hayes Predicts When Altcoin Season Will Begin","As historically proven, the start of an altcoin season, or ‘altseason,’ a period marked by the strong performance of alternative cryptocurrencies relative to Bitcoin, often begins following a significant increase in BTC’s price. This phenomenon has been elaborated recently by Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of BitMEX and Chief Investment Officer at Maelstrom Fund, who has now shared the specific time when the alt season for this cycle could begin. Related Reading: Is Now the Time to Buy Bitcoin? Top Analysts Predict $150K Surge On The Horizon Bitcoin And Ethereum: Key Price Targets To Kickstart Altcoin Season In Hayes’ latest substack blog post “Water, Water, Every Where,” the BitMEX co-founder suggests that certain key price marks for Bitcoin and Ethereum hold the key to altcoins commencing their next major rally. Hayes emphasizes that for altcoins to embark on a bullish trend, Bitcoin and Ethereum must surpass significant psychological barriers. According to the BitMEX co-founder, Bitcoin must break above $70,000, and Ethereum must exceed $4,000 to set the stage for a broader altcoin rally. These levels are seen as crucial for restoring investor confidence and enabling a flow of capital into smaller-cap coins. Hayes particularly noted: Alt szn will return only after Bitcoin and Ether decidedly break through $70,000 and $4,000, respectively. Solana will also climb over $250, but the crypto market-wide wealth effect of a Solana pump is nowhere near as potent as with Bitcoin and Ether, given the relative market caps. The combination of a dollar liquidity-inspired Bitcoin and Ether rally into year-end will create a strong foundation for the return of a sexy shitcoin soiree. The Potential Catalysts In addition to his alt season start-off forecast, the BitMEX co-founder disclosed some potential catalysts that could play a major role in these upcoming market rallies. Hayes connected these imminent market movements to macroeconomic factors, specifically the issuance of US Treasury bills (T-bills). He argues that these could introduce new liquidity into the crypto markets, propelling Bitcoin towards the $100,000 mark within this cycle. This anticipated flow of funds is expected to benefit Bitcoin and have a significant positive impact on Ethereum and, by extension, the broader altcoin market. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Gains Strength, Outpaces Bitcoin With An 8% Surge Hayes also commented on the upcoming US election and the likely impact on the crypto market. Referring to it as “a coin toss,” the BitMEX co-founder said that with the election in early November and Yellen being at “peak manipulation in October, there will be no better time for liquidity this year.” He added: Therefore, I shall sell into strength. I will not liquidate my entire crypto portfolio but take profits in my more speculative momentum trades. At the end of the note, the BitMEX co-founder touched on the US debts and reiterated his $1 million prediction on Bitcoin, noting: Once the US debt ceiling charade is over, liquidity will gush from the Treasury and possibly the Fed to get markets back on track. Then, the bull market will begin for realz. $1 million Bitcoin is still my base case.

Traders continue to remain bullish on TON because of its integration with Telegram and growing GameFi ecosystem.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} surged above $61,000 in early Asian trading hours Wednesday to lead gains among major tokens, reversing losses from a steep price drop earlier this month.  Bitcoin added over 3%, CoinGecko data shows, with majors ether {{ETH}}, Solana’s SOL, Cardano’s ADA, xrp {{XRP}} and BNB Chain’s BNB rising as much as 2.8%. Major memecoins dogecoin {{DOGE}} and shiba inu (SHIB) rose just 1%, suggesting sentiment wasn’t in favor of riskier bets.  Gains in bitcoin beat the 2.45% rise in the broader CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index tracking the largest tokens by market capitalization, minus stablecoins.  Despite the modest gains, some trading funds remain cautious amid a busy data week, warning of possible short-term tremors that could impede the ongoing rally.  “Investors remain cautious ahead of US CPI this week,” crypto trading firm QCP Capital said in a Telegram broadcast. “They will closely watch inflation numbers for guidance on whether the Fed will cut rates by 50 or 25 bps in September. The odds are now evenly split.”  Wednesday’s recovery helped chalk up gains for traders nursing losses after a 20% market-wide drop earlier in August as the popular yen carry trade unwinded. And some strategists warn of further losses related to the carry trade, stating its impact is not entirely over.  In a CNBC interview earlier this week, Richard Kelly, head of global strategy at TD Securities, said he is “very hesitant” to declare the end of the carry trade unwind.  “I’d push back on a lot of those narratives. You don’t have any real data to price your carry trades that we know,” Kelly said in the CNBC interview. “I think there is still a lot that can unwind, especially if you look at how undervalued yen is.’  “That is going to change the valuations for the next one to two years to come. That’s going to have spillover effects,” he added.  The Bank of Japan (BoJ) recently raised rates for the first time in over a decade, destabilizing global markets and risk assets, including bitcoin. When rates were low, traders borrowed yen for cheap to invest in another asset that provided a higher rate of return – creating the carry trade.  A bump in rates impacted the profitability of trading strategies, creating a ripple effect that impacted nearly all markets. BTC fell 15% in a 24-hour period, one of its largest drops in recent years, while major tokens slid at 22%.  Earlier in August, the deputy governor of the BOJ said that the central bank would avoid raising rates amid unstable markets, impacting yen carry trades and risk assets.  A former BOJ official has since said the central bank would defer additional interest rate hikes to next year, suggesting a preference for market stability over the near term.  Aside from bitcoin, traders continue to be bullish about TON.  Toncoin’s TON rose 7% during the Wednesday Asia trading session, according to CoinDesk Indices data. Stakeholders in the Toncoin ecosystem point to the growth of GameFi on the platform, as well as its close integration with Telegram as reasons for the token's continued growth.  ""The number of players of TON games break the ceiling glass of previous blockchain games by the viral social growth in Telegram. And some TON games have already verified the significant revenue from game play itself, not token selling,"" John Cheang, the TON Foundation's Asia-Pacific lead said in an email interview, while also pointing to TON's record-high blockchain transactions per seconds as a reason why it can scale.  Ben El-Baz, Managing Director of HashKey Global, which is an investor in TON-ecosystem projects like Catizen, added in an email comment that leveraging Telegram's advantage will ""attract more developers represents a significant opportunity for TON.""",NEUTRAL,BTC | TON,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | TON,"Sam Reynolds, Shaurya Malwa",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/14/bitcoin-crosses-61k-as-traders-remain-cautious-ahead-of-us-cpi-further-unwinding-of-yen-carry-trade,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/03ce4c2551a0bd7774235837ac9b23ad5c06f54d-1034x541.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A clear move above the $535 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $550. A close above the $550 resistance might set the pace for a larger increase toward the $565 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $580 level in the near term. Another Decline?

The analyst has also outlined when to expect this anticipated price increase. XRP Price Set To Hit $60 With Projected 10,400% Surge In an X (formerly Twitter) post on August 12, crypto analyst, Brett Hill expressed bullish optimism about XRP’s future price. The analyst suggests that XRP could be on the verge of a significant breakout, potentially propelling it to new all-time highs. Related Reading: Ethereum Return To $4,000: Key Zones And Price Levels To Watch He shared a chart tracking XRP’s price movements from March 2023 to 2025. Based on his analysis, the analyst predicts that XRP is poised to reach a price range of $50 to $60, representing a substantial 10,400% surge from its current value. While outlining his bullish forecast for XRP, Hill pointed to XRP’s weekly Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). The MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that is used to identify entry and exit points for crypto traders. The analyst disclosed that this unique indicator is currently signaling a strong bullish momentum for XRP, solidifying its potential price increase to new all time highs. He further highlighted a key support level at the $0.5403 mark. Hill has forecasted that XRP would potentially surge between $50 to $60 if it stays above the aforementioned support level. With XRP currently trading at $0.57, well above the crucial support level, this could mean that the $50 to $60 price target may be achieveable in the coming weeks. The analyst has also affirmed that as long as XRP holds this support level, it is well-positioned for “big gains.” Despite his rather ambitious and bullish prediction for the cryptocurrency, Hill warns that investors should watch out for a resistance level of $0.6836. He disclosed that if XRP can break through this resistance level, it could potentially trigger a powerful upward momentum that could send its price even higher. Analysts Stay Bullish On XRP After Legal Win In a previous X post, Hill forecasted that the XRP Ledger is poised for an explosive growth following Ripple’s recent legal victory over the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On August 8, the United States (US) South District Court fined Ripple $125 million in civil penalties for violating securities laws by selling XRP to institutional investors. Ripple’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Brad Garlinghouse sees the settlement fee as a significant win, given that the SEC had previously requested a whopping $2 billion in settlement.

Crypto enthusiast, Amelie disclosed that XRP’s newfound regulatory clarity was set to inject trillions of dollars into XRPL projects. Additionally, a crypto analyst identified as ‘CryptoBull’ on X has projected a major bullish price target for XRP. According to the analyst, XRP could surge anywhere between $13 and $46 within the next 1 to 18 months.

The token has significantly retraced from its march all-time high (ATH) and is currently testing key resistance levels. Some crypto analysts seem unsure about TAO’s short-term performance but remain bullish long-term. Related Reading: Buying The Dip: PEPE Price Recovers 10% As Whales Load Their Bags Bittensor To Lead The ‘AI Wave’? Bittensor Protocol’s token TAO recently saw a major downturn following the broader market retrace. The token, which had recovered the $300 mark in July, faced a significant correction as August started. The price decline deepened on August 5, falling below the $180 level. As the crypto market recovered, TAO’s price surged over 75% from its lowest point last Monday. The token retested the $300 resistance level over the weekend but failed to hold it as the market saw another crash this Monday. Bittensor’s native token registers a 10% drop from its Friday price of $315, which seems to have left some investors and market watchers pondering TAO’s short-term performance. According to renowned analyst Altcoin Sherpa, the AI token might experience another 25%-30% drop soon. To Sherpa, TAO’s “bearish market structure is still there,” which could drive the price below the $200 support level again “pretty soon.” Additionally, the analyst wonders whether AI tokens like TAO will outperform most of the market “like they did in early 2024.” Nonetheless, Gonzo, another market watcher, believes that the token will “lead the AI wave” in the coming months. Replying to Sherpa, the investor suggested that TAO might need to move sideways for a while and “hope that BTC doesn’t dump” to start a new uptrend. Gonzo also considers that Grayscale “might dump it hard to get in cheap” but “will pump it to make money” after launching its Bittensor fund. As reported by NewsBTC, Grayscale Investments announced the offering of its new crypto fund, the Grayscale Bittensor Trust, last week. No Clear Direction For TAO Short-Term Crypto trader Pidgeon analyzed TAO’s long-term performance, finding an unclear path in the shorter timeframes. Per the post, the chart displays a “big head and shoulders” pattern in the weekly timeframes. To the analyst, this pattern, which suggests a trend reversal, “remains completely irrelevant as long as Bittensor holds the $200 support area.” He considers that the chances of TAO holding this level significantly increased after “Monday’s major fakeout and liquidity sweep.” Additionally, Pidgeon highlighted that the token is moving within a clear range between the $210 and $360 levels in the daily timeframe, where the token has previously consolidated. The trader considers there won’t be “major direction until either side breaks.” To break from the downtrend, TAO must reclaim the $310 level before retesting the $360 mark. If it breaks above the $360 trendline, the token’s price could retest the $480 and $570 resistance levels before trying for a new ATH. Related Reading: Ethereum Nears Key Bearish Triangle Apex: Breakdown To $2,160 Target Looms If it fails to hold above the $200 support zone, it might “revisit the wick lows down around $160” and even go as low as $90. Nonetheless, he identified a lower high structure “that it has been stuck in for months” and that “tends to break to the upside.” Ultimately, the trader stated he’s leaning bullish med-long term, but it will depend on “which side of the range it breaks.” As of this writing, TAO is trading at $277, a 4% drop in the last 24 hours.

32384802,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635250,1723600846,Bitcoin Price Action “Boring” Despite Rapid Accumulation: Is Something Big Cooking?,"Though buyers stand a chance, Bitcoin is steady when writing, teetering at the $60,000 level. After rejecting August lows, the bounce above the round number at $60,000 to as high as $63,000 by the end of last week was impressive. However, from the daily chart, prices are moving sideways in a possible accumulation, bounded by the August 8 bullish engulfing bar. Bitcoin Is Moving Sideways And “Boring” Amid the optimism, the crypto market is quiet and even boring. Picking out this state of affairs, one analyst on X, citing on-chain developments, observed that the dull market explains the generally low activity. For instance, the analyst said that the Bitcoin netflow has stood at -8,748 BTC over the last seven days. Related Reading: AVAX Set For ATH? Analysts Predict Explosive Rise To $285 This means that more BTC was bought than sold, indicating accumulation amid the general market lull. That traders and investors are looking to buy at current prices is a net positive for bulls and might help steady prices in light of the dizzying fall to as low as $49,000 on August 5. The possible accumulation is unsurprising and aligns with the broader crypto market behavior. So far, Bitcoin, like Ethereum and even XRP, is in a bullish recovery after the crash in early August. Even though the bull bar of August 8 lifted sentiment, there has been no follow-through. The immediate resistance is $63,000, while support is between $57,000 and $60,000. If buyers are to press on, breaking $63,000, it will likely set up the base for another leg up to $70,000 and even all-time highs. Miner Liquidation Risk Low, BTC Holders Accumulation Even so, before then, Bitcoin is moving sideways and inside a bullish bar, a net positive for upbeat traders from an effort-versus-result perspective. On-chain data second this preview. According to Glassnode, Bitcoin is at the HODLing stage, and users are keen to accumulate. The decision to double down as spot rates when prices are lower could suggest confidence and expectation of even more gains in the coming days. Related Reading: Ethereum Nears Key Bearish Triangle Apex: Breakdown To $2,160 Target Looms Encouragingly, the possible leg up won’t face headwinds, especially from miners who may choose to dump. Weeks after Halving in late April, miners began dumping BTC, forcing prices lower, as evident throughout June. For now, there is stability as the hash rate–a measure of computing power–picks up, looking at YCharts. Daily miner revenue, one analyst notes, fell by roughly 60%, crashing from $75 million to as low as $30 million after Halving. Meanwhile, over the last 720 days, their reserve fell by 50,000 BTC as they sold to upgrade their gear and stay competitive. Even as they liquidate, the analyst is confident miners are not in immediate danger since their reserves remain at over 713,000 BTC.

The analyst also explained why this parabolic rally is possible for the second-largest crypto by market cap. Why A Rise To $4,723 Is Possible For Ethereum Marks mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Ethereum’s price is poised to rise to $4,723 as bull divergences continue to hold within a massive climb since breaking out. He added that the 75% move to this target and above can take place with the breakout and divergence holding. Related Reading: Legendary Fibonacci Extension Reveals When Bitcoin Will Reach $109,000 From the chart he shared, Marks also suggested that Ethereum’s price could rise to $8348. However, the analyst didn’t provide a timeline for when ETH will reach this price target. Crypto analyst Altcoin Daily also recently predicted that Ethereum could rise above $8,000 as he put his peak price target for ETH in this bull run at $8,800. Crypto analyst Poseidon also believes that Ethereum’s price can rise as high as $8,000. Meanwhile, crypto analyst DavidOnCrypto has provided a timeline for when Ethereum could reach $8,000, stating that it will happen in the next six months. He claimed that ETH’s move from its current price level to $8,000 would foreshadow the move that Bitcoin enjoyed as it rose from $25,000 to $70,000. Ethereum investors will undoubtedly be wary of such price targets, considering how much the crypto token has underperformed compared to Bitcoin since the start of the year. However, crypto analysts like Roman have assured that Ethereum’s time will come when it will make that parabolic run in this market cycle. The analyst explained that it wasn’t unusual for Ethereum’s price to lag while Bitcoin hit new highs. He alluded to 2020 when ETH was down 80% from its all-time high (ATH) while the flagship crypto broke its ATH. Roman predicted that Ethereum would make its run by year-end, as that is when he believes liquidity will begin to shift from Bitcoin to Ethereum and other altcoins. Some Positives For ETH Crypto analyst Crypto Kaleo recently stated that he is confident that Bitcoin’s dominance has hit cycle top. This represents a positive for Ethereum’s price as Crypto Kaleo noted that altcoins will begin to gain ground starting with the “king” ETH. He added that the real altcoin season begins when Bitcoin’s dominance drops beneath 50%. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says End Of This Bitcoin Bear Trap Could Drive Price To $72,000 Meanwhile, Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which has recently contributed much of the selling pressure on Ethereum, recorded its first zero-flow day since converting to a Spot Ethereum ETF. This is undoubtedly a positive for Ethereum, especially considering that Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) recorded 78 consecutive outflow days before registering its first day without an outflow. On the other hand, ETHE achieved this feat on the fourteenth day of trading as a Spot Ethereum ETF.
