42376437,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AZaT,1429122233,Former White House Advisor to Head MIT Digital Currency Initiative,"MIT Media Lab has announced the launch of Digital Currency Initiative, a three-pronged program aimed at increasing awareness of the technology on campus and abroad while providing research to promote policy and standards initiatives.  The news was first detailed in a post penned by former White House senior advisor and Digital Currency Initiative director Brian Forde, who today officially joined the university-run research laboratory.  Forde previously worked with the administration of current US president Barack Obama to help the government leverage emerging technologies.  Media Lab director Joi Ito, who earlier this week suggested an imminent announcement regarding the future of bitcoin at MIT, expressed his enthusiasm at the appointment while praising digital currencies for their disruptive potential.  Ito said:  “Brian’s experience mainstreaming emerging technologies from the rural mountains of Nicaragua to the White House will be invaluable as he tackles the challenges of digital currency – one of the most promising emerging technologies for the next 10 years.”  In his separate post, Forde went on to detail how the Digital Currency Initiative will seek to address questions regarding the technology's security, scalability and privacy, while convening governments and nonprofits ""to research and test concepts"" related to its use.  Collaborative effort  To drive this research, MIT Media Lab indicated it plans to engage a range of participants, from its current researchers to undergraduates like Jeremy Rubin, who helped pioneer bitcoin development on campus with the MIT Bitcoin Project.  Rubin's work was also cited by Ito who added:  ""The students running the MIT Bitcoin Club, the MIT Bitcoin Project, and the various events including the Bitcoin Expo have been a key part of getting this initiative started.""  Some of the more experienced names involved will be CSAIL’s Nickolai Zeldovich and Sloan School of Management’s Simon Johnson, who was the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund.  Forde hypothesized that by engaging such participants in the development of digital currency, the campus could ensure that the technology is able to bring about a new wave of innovation.  ""For comparison, the Internet had more than 20 years to mature in academia and government before its tremendous impact on mainstream commercial and personal use,"" Forde wrote.  Still, he suggested that more work needs to be done for the technology to be safe, secure and reliable enough for more widespread use, and that the industry is still openly suffering for poor public perception.  Development questions  The announcement notably follows on the heels of the public struggles by the Bitcon Foundation, the industry's oldest industry trade organisation and, historically, the group that funds the development of bitcoin's open ledger.  In recent weeks, the group has openly discussed pivoting away from core development, though debate remains ongoing regarding what, if any, role the foundation will continue to play in this process.  In his remarks, Forde suggested that the MIT Digital Currency Initiative would be open to hosting developers, though no specifics were detailed.  ""Interested companies, developers, and forward-thinking policy makers will also be engaged in the effort,"" Forde's post added.

42378160,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MLBB,1429115272,Buttercoin CEO Reveals 'Tactical Mistake' that Led to Company Closure,"One week after his startup's abrupt closure, Buttercoin CEO Cedric Dahl says the wider community should be careful to learn from his experience at the helm of the US bitcoin marketplace.  Despite accruing an impressive list of investors, including Google Ventures, Centralway Ventures and Y Combinator, Dahl suggested that it was Buttercoin's affiliation with larger investment firms that ultimately left it less able to adapt in a changing bitcoin ecosystem.  He told CoinDesk:  ""The big lesson is that you cannot rely on venture. You have to make a product that is self sustaining.""  Founded in 2013, Buttercoin raised $1.3m in funding, capital that helped make the startup 'one to watch' in a crowded market. However, in hindsight Dahl wouldn't have tried to raise venture funds at all, he said, calling the decision a ""tactical mistake"".  ""There's much more seed money out there. It's much easier to raise, whereas with venture, if you're not able to get it, the funding is over. With seed and angel money, you can keep going,"" he continued.  Since the move, some of the company's more high-profile customers have already reported switching marketplace providers, with MegaBigPower's Dave Carlson entering a business relationship with Boost VC-backed startup Hedgy.  Buttercoin's last full day of operations was 10th April, with employees scheduled to depart at close of business on 15th April.  Supply and demand  In interview, Dahl talked at length about his regret that he didn't bootstrap the company, instead trying to raise ""a significant amount"" early on.  ""What I should've done is really start with a fraction of what I would actually need and once you have enough demand, raise more,"" Dahl said.  Still, Dahl warned that having traction in the marketplace isn't everything, as he believes Buttercoin was able to achieve an active user base despite opening to the public roughly five months ago.  ""At the end of the day, we built a great product that had real growth that was growing between 10–25% per week,"" Dahl said.  Dahl also suggested the decline in the price of bitcoin was a factor in funding, noting that his initial fundraising took place when the price of bitcoin was at or near $1,000, compared to its current value of $220 at press time.  Consolidation to continue  Dahl also discussed the need for bitcoin industry executives to strike a balance between ""reality and perception,"" noting that both are equally important when dealing with potential investors.  ""Perception is important,"" Dahl continued, adding that he expects companies to raise funds without introducing products because of this factor.  The most likely targets for this funding, he suggested, would be first-time bitcoin investors or firms looking to capitalize on the big opportunities in the space. Further, he said that investment is likely to be split between large venture rounds and smaller seed investments, though all in line with an overall trend of consolidation.  ""If you look at the money this year, 50% has gone to two companies. That's a rough figure and I think you'll continue to see this distribution where fewer companies get more.""  Dahl went so far as to predict an environment where the number of bitcoin wallet providers is whittled down to a handful of well-capitalized winners.  ""I think that you'll find there's going to be a really big consolidation in the space,"" he added.  'Moonshot' option on table  Despite the formal announcement, Dahl suggested that he wasn't ruling out a last-minute bid to save the company or secure an exit for investors.  ""We're trying to do the best we can by our team and our investors, we're pursuing every option possible to get compensation,"" he said.  Overall, Dahl expressed his thanks to his team which he commended for handling both the scaling up, and subsequent winding down, of Buttercoin professionally. Going forward, Dahl indicated he would also seek to make himself available as a resource to aspiring bitcoin entrepreneurs.  Dahl concluded:  ""At the end of the day, I'm super proud of the team we put together and the product we've built.""
