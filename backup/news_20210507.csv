42406351,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetmHq,1620421055,The Anything-Can-Happen Days,"We're in the fun era of this industry.      For example: Uniswap is issuing non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to cryptocurrency wallets that lend assets to its market making services, as part of its version 3.0, released this week.      It was probably necessary to switch to NFTs from fungible tokens, because Uniswap's new system is so much more complicated than the old one. Here's what probably wasn't essential: Each of these NFTs comes with a special image that represents the deposit, something shiny and pretty with a hint of cyberpunk.      It's cute. I don't mean that condescendingly! It just is. The team didn't have to do this, but they did, because they knew people would like it.      We're in the time when people are going to keep finding extremely clever solutions for problems that crop up. It's so impressive that it makes heads spin. Someday it will hit an inflection point when what works is largely known and successful projects will do more to guard market share than solve problems.      So enjoy this time of inventiveness and charming little touches. It's happening now, and it's not going to last forever.      A little more on Uniswap, and then we'll pivot to NFTs.    Neat solutions    In case the very top of this post was a little baffling, let me explain a bit more. Uniswap is an automated market maker, which is a kind of exchange that always has a buy price and a sell price for any token it lists. In fact, it has a price for every token denominated in every other token.      Want to swap ZRX for WBTC? It's got a price for that.      The key point is this: It's an exchange where buyers and sellers trade with the exchange itself. A bunch of token holders have lent it coins on the promise that they would share in fees earned by the coins it lent Uniswap.      This model had some drawbacks, though, which we have explained in detail elsewhere. In short, under certain circumstances depositors could lose dollar-denominated value even as their crypto bags got heavier.      It's called impermanent loss. It's a head scratcher. Bancor and THORChain are similar services and they took the problem on. What do people usually do when they fear a loss? They provide insurance. So those products offered insurance in exchange for patience.      Uniswap looked at the problem a whole other way, though. It's new solution allows depositors to put guardrails on their trades. That fixed it.      It's just one of those reminders that pernicious problems are just one clever person away from solved.    NFTvolution    As also mentioned, Uniswap went further and added an imagistic NFT for its depositors, even though it didn't have to.      So let's talk about NFTs.      What's the No. 1 critique that gets made about NFTs?      Some version of: ""It's just a jpeg.""      Right?      OK. It's true-ish, with a caveat: for now.      NFTs are going to be more than jpegs. When? Before you know it. What will they be? Something else! It will make sense when it happens.      Well, it will make sense to the people for whom it makes sense. Then some of them will make it make sense to others. And then everyone else will feel as though they just have to figure it out. That's what happened with social networks, cell phones and the web itself (I was there for all of them).      But there's some twist to be made on digital ownership out there, some tweak to the NFT model as we know it that will speak very loudly to the notion that this thing has to be owned, this has to be digital and this could only work online.      That's coming. Someone will figure out. Someone will look at this quandary differently and come up with something new.      And technology will once again teach its lesson: You never know what the new thing is really for until it shows you.      They won't learn the lesson of course. They never do.      So that's the good news. The bad news: It won’t always be this way. On the old web, people used to start companies to change the world. Now they start companies to be acquired as potential features tacked upon tech giants.      But here on the blockchain, there are tons of experiences that aren't quite right, processes that don't quite make sense and best practices that are just too hard to practice. When those are solved the right way, the solution will look like it should have been obvious all along. It will feel natural.      That's delightful.      And this is the time of delights. It's nice!

The U.S. economy added 266,000 jobs in April, missing estimates of a 1 million gain. The weak jobs report reinforced expectations of continued easy money policy at the Federal Reserve, which sent bitcoin (BTC) higher by about 2% over the past 24 hours. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq also ended the day in the green while safe havens such as Treasury bonds sold off.      The April jobs miss suggests a fragile economic recovery, which means easy money from the Fed could continue to fuel the rally across risk assets. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has stated that rising inflation is transitory and whether the U.S. central bank's tightening policy will depend on a variety of factors including labor market conditions.      “The reaction from bitcoin is undeniable,"" said Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics, in his daily newsletter. ""Even gold and silver hit fresh highs.""      Speculation is prompting funds to flow beyond bitcoin as altcoins take the lead.

This time, it’s dogecoin,” according to Greenspan.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $57,902 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 3.2% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $55,321-$58,724 (CoinDesk 20)  Ether (ETH) trading around $3,524 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 1.5% over the previous 24 hours.  Ether’s 24-hour range: $3,361-$3,590 (CoinDesk 20)    Bitcoin bounced above $57,000 around the time of the release of the U.S. jobs report. The cryptocurrency was trading around $58,000 at the time of writing and is holding support on intraday and daily time frames.      Technical charts imply that bitcoin will likely trade higher over the weekend and through next week, although further momentum is needed to push prices past $60,000.      For now, as bitcoin consolidates, traders are turning their attention to altcoins.    Bitcoin dominance continues to fade    It’s definitely altcoin season, evidenced by the bitcoin dominance ratio declining below the 50% threshold. The ratio measures the total market cap of BTC versus the market cap of the entire cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin dominance is currently at the lowest level since July 2018.      “Historically, bitcoin reaches its all-time-high and then drops, which starts an alt season,” wrote Adam Morris, co-founder of Crypto Head, a cryptocurrency education website, in an email.      “It’s coins like this that are first to drop 95% in a market crash, which has already happened in the 2018 crash,” wrote Morris referring to the popularity around dogecoin, which is now the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.      “On the other hand, it's likely that ethereum will keep rising and if history repeats itself we'll probably see it all-time-high towards the end of the year,” Morris wrote.    Ether futures volume approached $1 billion    Ether futures volume approached $1 billion on Tuesday as the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap broke above $3,500. ETH is up about 28% over the past seven days compared to BTC’s gain of 1.5%. Higher volumes in the futures market suggests growing interest from sophisticated traders who wish to hedge or speculate on price movements.      In the options market, traders anticipate higher ETH volatility relative to BTC, evidenced by the one-month ETH-BTC implied volatility spread.

42386696,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUZob,1620415282,Ethereum Classic’s ‘Irrational’ Price Tripling Bears Hallmark of Dogecoin Frenzy,"Ethereum classic (ETC), the not-really-like-ether (ETH) sibling of the Ethereum blockchain’s native cryptocurrency, is on track for the best weekly performance in its four-year history, with prices nearly tripling since Sunday.      Analysts in the digital-asset market say the price move likely reflects a speculative fever among retail traders rather than deeply informed bets on the Ethereum Classic blockchain’s future technological potential.      The dynamic might show that the just-for-fun yucks of trading the joke token dogecoin (DOGE) (which bears the hallmark of this year’s frenzy in GameStop shares on Wall Street) might be spilling over to almost-left-for-dead cryptocurrency projects from the last big bull market in 2017.      Few professional cryptocurrency-market analysts see Ethereum Classic as possessing the disruptive potential of Ethereum or other up-and-coming blockchains like Binance Smart Chain or even Cardano.      But to retail traders looking to bet on price-go-up, the ETC tokens might be looking pretty good, and cheap.      “I think a lot of the interest has to do with the fact that dogecoin has moved so much and U.S. retail is looking for the next big asset,” Joshua Frank, co-founder and CEO of crypto data firm The TIE, which tracks social media interest in digital-asset markets.      At press time, ethereum classic is changing hands at $133.72, up 7.96% in the past 24 hours.      Ethereum Classic was born out of a contentious split from Ethereum in 2017, known in blockchain lingo as a “hard fork."" However, it quickly lost the support of the larger Ethereum software-developer community and has never attained a similar level of respect among industry executives and investors. The project’s market capitalization is less than one-twentieth of Ethereum’s $409 billion and it has been the victim of several 51% attacks.      Yet, that hasn't stopped ETC's price from shooting up for eight straight days in the current bull market. For instance, the ETC price rose 47% on May 5, according to data from Coinbase and TradingView.      The ETC growth is also supported by trading activity: Trading volume for ethereum classic on Thursday surged above $10 billion on Upbit, a Korean cryptocurrency exchange, according to data from CoinMarketCap.      “It’s a crazy, irrational market now,” Ki Young Ju, the chief executive of South Korea-based blockchain data firm CryptoQuant, said. “People will learn.”      Bitcoin’s rally since the beginning of last year could be mainly attributed to institutional investors in North America. Some of them have argued that bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency (with a market capitalization of about $1.1 trillion) might work well as a hedge against inflation in the wake of trillions of dollars of coronavirus-prompted monetary stimulus from central banks around the world.      Ethereum classic’s gains, by contrast, appear to be largely driven by retail investors in both the West and East, according to analysts. That’s similar to the driving force behind the meme-centered dogecoin.      The TIE’s Frank says he noticed ethereum classic was trading at more than a 50% premium on U.S.-based, retail-focused crypto trading platforms including Robinhood and Coinbase, compared with prices at roughly the same time on other native cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance.      The observation suggests rising demand for the ETC token from retail investors in the U.S.      “If institutions were behind the move, I don't think you would have seen such a large spread in price between major exchanges with the retail-focused platforms having such a significant price premium,” Frank said.      The number of tweets about ethereum classic and bitcoin cash (BCH), a token created from a hard fork of the Bitcoin blockchain, has soared in the past week, another indication “a mass market” could be behind the outperformance, said Frank.      Robinhood currently supports seven cryptocurrencies on its platform: bitcoin, bitcoin cash, bitcoin sv (BSV), dogecoin, ether, ethereum classic and litecoin (LTC), according to its website. Among those, only ETC and dogecoin have outperformed both bitcoin and ether on a year-to-date basis.      In South Korea, where ETC’s trading volume is surging on the Upbit exchange, investors behind the rally are only looking at profits in the short term, Ju said.      “There are no institutional investors in Korea,” Ju said. “Koreans are seeking cheap coins that look likely to be pumped.”      Analysts expressed concern investors would get hurt eventually by the recent speculative fervor in these lesser cryptocurrencies. After the pump comes the dump, the thinking goes.      “Investors will get burned at some point, but this could go on for a while,” Frank said.      Thursday on Twitter, @SecretOfCrypto, who has more than 176,000 followers, tweeted that cryptocurrency markets are in a phase where ether has outperformed bitcoin and new money has started flowing into other large-cap tokens seen as having more room to spike in price.      “Memes are everywhere,” according to the tweet. “Everyone is super excited and you feel the mania in the air.""",NEGATIVE,DOGE | ETC,DOGE | ETC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/07/ethereum-classics-irrational-price-tripling-bears-hallmark-of-dogecoin-frenzy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b5afb58309daf56d7c317f3f47ad8fd49850a9bf-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42386698,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUZr7,1620415039,Money Reimagined: NFTs Can Help Create a New Internet,"Donald Trump was back. And then he wasn’t. In this week’s column we look at the decision by Facebook’s oversight board that the social media company can continue its suspension of the former president’s account.      Note: This is not to take a view in favor or against Trump’s right to publish on Facebook, or on the veracity of, or harm done by, the posts that got him into trouble with both Facebook and Twitter. Rather, it’s to use those questions as a lens for looking at the broken state of the digital media economy in the Web 2.0 era.      Elsewhere in the newsletter, we look at bitcoin’s (BTC) correlation with U.S. stocks, at Crypto Twitter and Bill Maher’s mutual need for attention and (what else?) at dogecoin’s (DOGE) insane price rally.      Once you’ve read the newsletter, be sure to listen to this week’s episode of our “Money Reimagined” podcast. Sheila Warren and I bring in Nathaniel Whittemore, host of CoinDesk’s “Breakdown” podcast, and Coin Center’s Neeraj Agrawal, to discuss the importance to the crypto community of memes like “Laser Eyes” and the “Honey Badger of Money” as well as of the shifting narratives about Wall Street, gold and inflation.    An NFT Fix for Deplatforming    Two seemingly unrelated events this week shone light on the problem of centralized information control that eats at the integrity of the internet economy.    You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    While the issues they raised are far from new, they emerged at a time when crypto-inspired Web 3.0 ideas such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have become possible solutions. Time will tell if they create a fairer system or reinforce old imbalances.      The biggest of the two news items was Wednesday’s ruling by Facebook’s oversight board allowing the company to extend its suspension of former President Donald Trump’s account but requiring Facebook to decide in six months whether the ban is permanent.      No matter what side of the Trump divide you’re on, you can see that “deplatforming” controversies like this expose the enormous discretionary power that big internet platforms like Facebook and Google wield over which ideas the public gets to hear.      As CNN’s Donie O’Sullivan noted, Facebook’s effort to “punt” the politically fraught decision to an outside body backfired. In putting the ball back in Facebook’s court until November, the board recognized that the power to decide whose voice is heard ultimately resides with shareholders (whose interests may diverge from those of the platform’s users). The other relevant event was Reuters’ move to retire the URL “blogs.reuters.com,” which led Felix Salmon, now a writer for Axios, to complain that the 169-year-old news service had “vaporized” his past blog posts, highlighting the irony of something he’d written a decade earlier:      Salmon’s word choice was a tad extreme. It turns out his Reuters posts are still available at this archive link. Still, searches on both Google and Reuters failed to find that page and offered no links to archives of other past Reuters bloggers angered by change, including Jennifer Ablan, Rolfe Winkler and Dean Wright.      This shows that deplatforming is not just about whether published material exists somewhere on the internet; it’s about how easily people find it. And that hinges on the immense curation power enjoyed by the internet platforms.      Whatever shape the next phase that economy takes, we must address this power imbalance.    Broken business model    This all stems from the internet business model that emerged with the start of the Web 2.0 era early in the new millennium.      Web 1.0 made it clear that in slashing the cost of both publishing and accessing information the internet had undermined traditional media publishers’ dominance of content production and distribution.      In theory, this was a positive, democratizing step enabling a wider, diversified array of information sources and bringing us closer to the utopian ideal of a “marketplace of ideas.”      The problem was no one could figure out how to reliably monetize content amid that free-for-all. For publishers, audiences became maddeningly fickle, flitting between independent bloggers, websites and mainstream publishers without the predictability advertisers demanded. If media companies couldn’t make money, how would society pay for the production, verification and distribution of trustworthy news and information?      Enter Google. Its powerful, ever-improving algorithm gave it unassailable leadership over search, creating a massive user base that represented the one thing every publisher wanted: an audience. Then Google learned how to track users’ behavior to create definable, deliverable audiences to sell to publishers and advertisers. So began the age of surveillance capitalism.      The Google model became the modus operandi for Facebook and other social media platforms, attracting advertising dollars that would otherwise have gone to the publishers.      Tapping increasingly complex user data to curate content with which to corral audiences into advertiser-ready interest groups, the algorithms evolved toward behavior modification. We’ve all had experiences where Google or Amazon starts suggesting products related to some topic in which we’ve shown interest. There are also stories of the YouTube recommendation algorithm taking people down rabbit holes that begin with video game tutorials and end with allegiances to white supremecist groups.      There’s clear evidence these audience curation models shaped our politics. Cambridge Analytica exploited Facebook’s to build voter support for Brexit. Social media echo chambers helped deepen the United States’ political divisions.      We went from the utopian vision of a marketplace where ideas compete on their merits for public acceptance to a nightmare in which they compete for acceptance by a secret algorithm and are vulnerable to doing “Facebook jail time” if they cross some arbitrary, ill-defined line of acceptability enforced by company contractors.    Can NFTs help?    The solution: Upend the business model. This is where NFTs might be useful because they represent a first, modest step toward solving one of the core problems of Web 2.0: digital replicability.      As content moved online where it could be easily copied at near-zero cost and then disseminated by anyone under the cloak of anonymity, traditional media companies lost control of both their product and their revenues.      They tried to solve it with digital rights management (DRM). But as media companies wedded themselves to litigious copyright enforcement, Facebook and Twitter created a more open environment that encouraged posting, sharing and engagement by general users who were happy to give their content away. By inserting blanket waivers into their terms and conditions, they encouraged an explosion of content and captured an audience. Media companies couldn't afford to ignore those audiences so they, too, had to play by the platforms’ rules.    Read more: Money Reimagined: NFTs Can Learn From DeFi’s Growth    Eventually, the largest publishers figured out how to survive as paywalls for news sites slowly became acceptable. But not only did those barriers undercut the idea of an open “marketplace of ideas,” they were viable only for big firms that had earlier weathered the heavy legal and production costs required to compete in those early difficult years. It took the deaths of thousands of smaller newspapers to get to this point.      Then, along came NFTs.      In establishing digital scarcity via one-of-a-kind tokens, and in holding out the promise of peer-to-peer digital media exchanges, NFTs hint at new approaches for media companies and brands to engage directly with their audiences without the intermediation of the platforms.      NFTs pose their own ownership issues. Many buyers are discovering they don’t really own the art or content to which they are attached.      And, as Khloe Kardashian’s bikini photo saga shows, it’s very hard to stop the replication of content, especially when it’s going viral. NFTs can’t physically stop or control the copying of digital content.      However, we can establish standards assuring that special rights to NFT-associated content are not controlled by a separate custodial platform but are assigned to the token owner and cryptographically bundled with the token itself so they can be easily transferred to the buyer with each downstream sale.      Among other design features, this model will require storing the content’s genesis version in a permanent location that no centralized entity – be it a media company, a social media platform, a hosting service like AWS, or a government – can ever take down. And to ensure the future market for digital content has no shortfalls requiring the kind of centralized fixes that grow into Google-like monopolies, it will also need self-sovereign identity, decentralized token exchanges and interoperability protocols. When combined, these technologies could completely transform the digital media economy.      People are hard at work on these big ideas, all of which deal with the problem of trust in a decentralized environment. There’s the decentralized storage models of Filecoin and Sia. And there are big ideas around decentralized web infrastructure at the Web3 Foundation, with its interoperability protocol Polkadot, and at Cosmos.      We must take lessons from the first two phases of the internet, when the network routing architecture was decentralized but developers overlooked the “double-spend problem” (which the Bitcoin white paper solved) holding back digital money, identity and content.      If we rush into these new solutions without thinking through all the interconnected pieces, we’ll end up in the same place.    Off the Charts: Converging divergence    Today’s chart offers a reminder to put conclusions based on anecdotal observations to the rigor of statistical analysis.      I asked our data visualization guru Shuai Hao to compare a chart of the S&P 500 index (SPX) with one capturing the correlation coefficient between bitcoin’s price and the value of that same index. My hunch was we’d find the latter rising because both stocks and bitcoin had seemed to move in unison of late, in particular when both fell after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned that interest rates may rise to address market overheating, and then jointly recovered when she wound back those comments. The chart Shuai gave me shows how wrong I was.      I figured that when stock investors go into “risk off” mode, they treat bitcoin as a correlated risk asset and sell it along with equities; whereas in calmer moments, or when bitcoin itself is being affected by factors unrelated to stocks, the correlation falls as bitcoin is viewed in isolation at those times.      The chart does hold up that idea for certain moments in time – notably during the big COVID-driven market rout in March 2020, when both stocks and bitcoin plummeted before the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing buoyed investors. But it takes extreme moments such as that for the correlation to increase. Mostly, bitcoin lives in isolation.      Over the past two years, the correlation coefficient between bitcoin and the SPX has remained low, oscillating between positive or negative readings that suggest no consistent pattern. Right now, when investors are responding to the utterings of the Treasury Secretary but by no means freaking out, the correlation is, literally, zero. For those looking for an uncorrelated asset with which to diversify a portfolio, that’s pretty compelling.    The Conversation: Bill Maher roils Crypto Twitter    Bill Maher became the latest baby boomer to earn the “Old Man Yells at Bitcoin Cloud” label from Crypto Twitter. The comedian dedicated his monologue last Friday evening to mocking cryptocurrencies and the people who develop the technology.      Maher went after the “nerds” who invented cryptocurrencies, noting that “one of them, in 2008 … made up Bitcoin out of thin air using the fake name Satatoshi (sic) Nakamoto, which I think are the Japanese words for ‘monopoly money.’” Crypto Twitter was not amused.      There was mockery from podcaster Peter McCormack:      There was a “stay humble” appeal to the crypto “fam” from Matt Odell:      And there was this earnest outreach from “Pomp"":      Look, Maher’s piece was boring, predictable and based on the tired logic of many, many ill-informed people over the years. But it was just comedy. Bad comedy, maybe. But nothing to get worked up over.      The impression one gets in these moments, where critics say something provocative and the Crypto Twitterati respond with indignation, is that both sides quietly need each other. As discussed above, the digital media economy runs on a system that’s deliberately designed to encourage endless engagement and sharing. Maher’s personal “currency” is bolstered as much by angry replies as by “likes.” The same goes for that of many of Crypto Twitter’s personalities. It’s a symbiotic relationship.    Relevant reads: Doge debate    Despite ourselves, we can’t stop talking about dogecoin. A currency that has increased around 10-fold the past month alone and whose market cap earlier this week surpassed that of Lloyds Banking Group and yet was founded, quite literally, as a joke, is, frankly, unignorable. The good news is that, as CoinDesk’s coverage revealed, there are plenty of angles, some quite serious, others less so, to this phenomenon.    The rally was boosted early in the week by decisions from eToro and Gemini to list the cryptocurrency on their exchanges, as reported by Sebastian Sinclair and Omkar Godbole.  That resulted in a two-day surge that on Wednesday pushed the Shiba Inu-themed currency beyond the 69-cent mark, a threshold the doge community had hoped to break on April 20, “National Stoner Day.” Sinclair’s coverage of that dubiously historic moment includes a rundown of the Galaxy Digital team’s deep-dive research report into “The World’s Most Honest S**tcoin.”  What if all goes south? So asks Daniel Kuhn in a piece for The Node newsletter, which ponders what might happen if a collapse in dogecoin leads to a regulatory crackdown.  But it’s too early to worry about such things. Leave that for Monday. For now, all you need to know is that dogecoin buyers are hoping Elon Musk will utter the “D” word during his “Saturday Night Live” appearance this weekend. As CoinDesk’s Ollie Leach notes, “Only in the looking-glass world of 2021 could a late-night comedy show have the potential to move markets.”",NEUTRAL,BTC | DOGE,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Michael J.

42386685,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUZZV,1620414458,How to File Your Crypto Taxes (and Not Get Screwed),"Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are transforming the world of finance. More than 21 million U.S. adults own assets like bitcoin or ethereum, crypto credit cards are growing in popularity, and artists are making thousands of dollars selling non-fungible tokens (NFTs).      These products and positions all raise tax implications that too often go unconsidered. Purchasing an NFT with bitcoin? Taxable. Trading your dogecoin for ethereum? Taxable. Using your staking income to buy a coffee from a vendor accepting crypto? Taxable.    Seth Wilks is the Director of Tax & Accounting SME at TaxBit.    You get the idea. Taxes around cryptocurrency can be complicated. Whether you’ve just started dabbling in the world of crypto or you're a long-time believer, it’s important to understand how cryptocurrency tax reporting works so that you can stay compliant and enable this transformative innovation to continue to thrive.    Read more: Opinion: How to Minimize Your Crypto Taxes  1. Most crypto activity is taxed as property – and you need to report more than just cashing out    There’s a common misconception that you have to report crypto taxes only when you sell your crypto for fiat currency. While that is indeed a taxable event, it’s not the only activity that you need to include on your return.      For most people who invest and trade cryptocurrency, it’s taxed as property much like stocks. That means you’ll have to report capital gains or losses on Form 8949 for the following activities:    Selling your crypto for cash  Trading one cryptocurrency for another cryptocurrency  Using cryptocurrency at a merchant as payment (for those who use crypto debit cards, this applies to you as well)  Buying an NFT with crypto.  2. Crypto earned as income also needs to be reported on your tax return    It’s also possible to have received cryptocurrency as income. These interactions will need to be reported on a separate part of your return:    Receiving airdropped tokens resulting from a hard fork  Staking or mining cryptocurrency  Getting paid in crypto.  3. If you don’t report your crypto taxes, you run the risk of being audited by the IRS    Failure to report any of the taxable events will likely result in an Internal Revenue Service audit. For the first time this year, the IRS has placed a question at the top of Form 1040 that asks “[a]t any time during 2020, did you receive, sell, send, exchange, or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency?”      So, if you’ve done any of the above taxable crypto activities, it’s in your best interest to answer that question honestly and report your taxes on the proper forms. It should be noted that more and more exchanges are starting to report crypto activities to the IRS through From 1099-B, which means the IRS is already aware of some of your activities.    4. Not all crypto activity is taxable    Good news! Just because you own crypto doesn’t mean you owe taxes. If you bought crypto and haven’t disposed of it, you have no taxable activity to report. Nontaxable activities include:    Transferring assets between exchanges  Buying cryptocurrency (although nontaxable, it does set your cost-basis)  Gifting cryptocurrency (this excludes large gifts that may trigger other tax obligations)  Donating cryptocurrency (instead, this is tax deductible!).    While donating cryptocurrency is not a taxable event, it is recommended that you do report the donations on your tax return because you may be eligible for the itemized charitable deduction.    5. Wash sale rules don’t apply to crypto    Cryptocurrency provides the unique opportunity of being able to appreciate wealth over time while saving money on taxes. Because wash sale rules don’t apply to cryptocurrency, you can enjoy the tax advantages of offsetting taxable gains with investment losses and immediately buy back the same asset to maintain your position in the asset (i.e. continue to hodl).    6. Crypto tax rates depend on your holding period    The rate cryptocurrency is taxed at depends on how long you held the asset for and your annual income. If you held the asset for less than one year, your cryptocurrency gains will be taxed as a short-term capital gain at the same rate as your ordinary income, with a range of 10% - 37%. If you held the asset for more than one year, it will be taxed at the long-term capital gains tax rate, with a range of 0% - 20%.    7. Capital losses can be used to minimize your tax liability    That’s right! While a bummer at the time, capital losses can be used to offset your gains and reduce the amount of taxes you could owe! Savvy crypto investors are well aware of the tax implications of their trades throughout the year – and they use that to their advantage through a strategy called tax-loss harvesting.      And, even if you don’t have capital gains to offset, tax-loss harvesting could still be beneficial as a capital loss deduction from your income.    Time to file those crypto taxes? Follow these steps:    Step 1: To start, you’ll need a list of all your exchanges and transactions, including any 1099 forms received from exchanges.      Step 2: Next, calculate your capital gains and losses by subtracting your cost-basis, or the price you bought the asset at, from the price you sold the asset at (Capital Gain or Loss = Selling Price - Cost-Basis).      Step 3: Fill out your capital gains and losses on IRS Form 8949 for all events taxable as property.      Step 4: Transfer totals from your IRS 8949 to Form 1040 Schedule D.      Step 5: Fill out any remaining cryptocurrency income on Form 1040 (remember, this is from mining or staking, air drops, or getting paid in crypto).      That’s it! At least for most people. If you are a higher volume trader, the process gets much more complex and it’s recommended that you use crypto tax automation software to calculate your gains and losses.      Keep in mind that the more attention you pay to the tax implications of your crypto transactions year round, the easier you’ll have it come tax time. Not only that, but by making strategic trades in loss positions, you can reduce your tax liability – or even get a tax refund! Your future self will thank you later.

42386689,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUZiJ,1620413139,Marathon Miners Have Started Censoring Bitcoin Transactions; Here's What That Means,"Marathon Digital Holdings’ (MARA) new mining pool has mined a bitcoin block that is “fully compliant with U.S. regulations,” meaning the company has started excluding transactions from entities it believes are sanctioned by the U.S. Department of Treasury or have been involved in dark web activity.      The Marathon OFAC pool, which was first announced in late March, “refrains from processing transactions from those listed on the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN)” to stay “compliant with U.S. regulatory standards,” according to the company.      Marathon said it is addressing a concern among “many large funds and corporations"" that have"" expressed interest in purchasing bitcoin” by marketing its mined bitcoin as OFAC-compliant. Marathon spokesman Jason Assad confirmed that the firm's first OFAC pool block censored some transactions, but didn’t specify which ones.      “By excluding transactions between nefarious actors, we can provide investors and regulators with the peace of mind that the bitcoin we produce is ‘clean’, ethical and compliant with regulatory standards,” Marathon said in a statement.    Read more: How Bitcoin Mining Works    It should be noted that Marathon is mining “compliant” blocks of its own volition and that nothing in the current U.S. regulatory or legal code explicitly mandates that practice for miners.      The company uses DMG’s Walletscore blockchain surveillance software to filter transactions, Assad told CoinDesk. The blacklist is “based on information provided by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and Office of Foreign Assets Control, databases of OFAC restricted cryptocurrency addresses, as well as other sources including the dark web,” he said.      Iran, which is included on OFAC’s sanctions list, is a hotbed of bitcoin adoption, partly in response to the pressures sanctions place on its citizens. (Notably but unrelated, Iran’s government just said that only bitcoin produced in Iran is legal to trade.)    What are ‘clean’ bitcoins?    The practice of censoring transactions, sanctioned or otherwise (put another way, excluding them from blocks because of the sender’s presumed identity), is a subject of heated debate within the Bitcoin community. Satoshi Nakamoto designed Bitcoin mining to facilitate permissionless and censorship resistant transfers of value, but initiatives like Marathon's undermine that feature for no reason, critics say.      ""It is totally against the Bitcoin ethos as they are trying to make it a permissioned protocol instead of open for all,"" said Ben Carman, a Bitcoin Core and Suredbits developer.      He also said Marathon's approach doesn't make sense. ""They are mining blocks that will not have the highest fee transactions, but (are) still on top of blocks with transactions they deem 'bad,' giving them more security,"" he said.      Others also questioned the practicality of making a compliance claim.      Indeed, despite Marathon’s surveillance, transactions from a Russian dark web market, Hydra, were still processed in the “clean” block.      Further, shortly after Marathon blazoned the “clean” block on social media, bitcoiners from Iran and around the world began to send bitcoin to the address that received the Marathon “clean” block reward. The gesture was meant to display how easy it is to undermine Marathon’s initiative (and thus demonstrate how futile the chase is for “clean” coins).      Miners speaking to CoinDesk from other pools declined to go on the record about Marathon and its compliance push, but the sentiment was generally negative. One miner laughed at the notion, while another called it a manufactured issue.    The economics of a ‘compliant’ bitcoin block    Marathon began directing its hashrate, or computer processing power, to the OFAC pool on May 1 and mined its first block on May 5, Bitcoin block 682170. That block’s transaction fee reward, 0.05 BTC (worth less than $3,000 at the time) is substantially less than the fees collected in the blocks before or after it (both of which were 0.31 BTC or ~$17,800). Block 682172 included 0.48 BTC for nearly $28,000.      BitMEX Research’s diagnosis notes that the block “contained 0.00330944 BTC less transaction fees than expected.” The block excluded a number of transactions that BitMEX’s own hypothetical template would have included, which “could indicate censorship,” the post said.      Interestingly, it also included many transactions that BitMEX’s model excluded because their fees were too low to be considered a priority. That could indicate “out-of-band payments” for the fee, BitMEX says, which are under-the-table payments that are not included in the payer’s transaction.      If Marathon is not receiving out-of-band fees, then so far its “compliant” blocks are netting significantly less in transaction fees. That portion of the block reward has become increasingly important for miner profits as bitcoin’s block subsidy has dwindled to its current rate of 6.25 BTC per block and demand for bitcoin has grown.      Marathon’s block occurred only a minute after the one before, which could explain the block’s lower fee reward and transaction count. Marathon, however, still used it to censor transactions that, for other miners, would have gone through.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/05/07/marathon-miners-have-started-censoring-bitcoin-transactions-heres-what-that-means,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6d4193e2973aeeb58193ecd0ec5960a8e5fe9c29-2122x1413.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386694,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUZm5,1620409141,"Consensus 2021: Crypto Is Booming in Brazil, but Regulations Lag Behind","Gustavo Filgueiras, a 25-year-old businessman in Brazil, began trading cryptocurrencies in 2019 after seeing an acquaintance’s crypto investment portfolio.      “I like high-risk investments because they usually result in higher profits. As a consequence, crypto caught my eye,” Filgueiras said.      Filgueiras knows 15 or so crypto investors in Brazil, the majority of whom are day traders looking for quick gains. A few use crypto for savings or as a store of value, he said.      Crypto is booming in Brazil, fueled by day traders like Filgueiras and his colleagues eager to take advantage of the ongoing bull market. Regulators, however, have yet to catch up. Save for a few tax requirements, Brazil’s crypto industry remains largely unregulated.    CEO of QR Capital Fernando Carvalho will be speaking at Consensus by CoinDesk, our virtual experience May 24-27. Register here.    Brazil's largest bitcoin exchange reported record trading volumes in the first quarter of 2021. Locals say they're interested in making a profit off the asset class. This is part of a larger regional trend: Other South American countries like Colombia and Argentina are seeing an explosion of interest in crypto as retail traders take advantage of crypto as an investment, remittance tool or store of value.      Brazil, the largest economy in Latin America, is struggling to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. It is one of the countries hit hardest by the pandemic, trailing the U.S. and India. The country’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, is facing a criminal investigation for his controversial response to the pandemic. The economy is at risk of not recovering quickly from the recession that followed the first wave of the pandemic, while experts predict a spike in the inflation rate.      Against this backdrop of political and economic uncertainty, institutional and retail traders alike are piling into crypto. Their interest was bolstered by the launch of two crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) earlier this year.    Big growth    In the first quarter of 2021 alone, the country’s largest bitcoin exchange, Mercado Bitcoin, (with around 2.7 million users) traded almost $5 billion in crypto on its platform.      This year’s volume so far is larger than the volume traded on the platform between 2013 and 2020, Mercado CEO Reinaldo Rabelo told CoinDesk. Through all of 2020 the platform traded just $1.2 billion.      Mercado Bitcoin was able to complete its first fundraising round this year, led by GP Investments and Parallax, and secured a $40 million investment to expand to other markets, Rabelo said. As part of this investment plan, Mercado agreed to buy Blockchain Academy, the largest crypto school in Brazil.      “In the Brazilian market, the recent growth is due to the institutionalization of the subject, stimulated by the Coinbase [public listing], which led banks and even Brazil’s stock exchange B3, to make positive statements about investments in cryptocurrencies,” Rabelo said.      Meanwhile, other big players in the region have moved in. In December, Mexico-based Bitso raised $62 million – a hefty portion of which was dedicated to expansion into Brazil. The firm launched operations in Brazil last week but did not answer specific questions about its volume in South America’s largest nation by press time.      Argentinian crypto exchange Ripio began operations in Brazil in 2016. According to Juan Mendez, chief brand officer at Ripio, the platform had a couple of hundred users in Brazil at the beginning. Although Ripio saw impressive growth in Argentina in the last few years, adoption in Brazil was relatively slow, according to Mendez.      But the numbers really started to pick up last year.      “Since November 2020 we have seen an incremental growth in volume, and our user base is growing 10% month over month. That's a great sign that adoption is growing steadily in Brazil,” Mendez said.      In January 2021, Ripio acquired Brazil’s second-largest crypto exchange, BitcoinTrade, to expand its presence in the country.    Crypto ETFs and bitcoin’s appeal    In February, Brazilian asset manager Hashdex announced the launch of one of the world’s first crypto exchange-traded funds. The ETF created by Hashdex and Nasdaq, tracks the Nasdaq crypto index, and allows investors to access a diversified crypto portfolio in one transaction. The ETF began trading on the Sao Paulo-based stock exchange B3 in late April.      In March, the Brazilian securities and exchange commission also approved a bitcoin ETF created by Latin American blockchain investment firm QR Capital.      “We’re seeing lots of demand for bitcoin at what is the beginning of institutional adoption in Brazil. So we have a very strong expectation about this product,” Fernando Carvalho, CEO of QR Capital, told CoinDesk, adding the ETF will start trading on B3 in late May.      According to Carvalho, the 2020 bitcoin price run.was one reason for the increasing demand for bitcoin in Brazil through the pandemic. The demand spiked even more as the country’s central bank brought down its key interest rate to a historic low of 2% in August, and people began looking for alternative investments.      Further, in 2020 Brazil’s inflation rate rose to over 5% for the first time in four years as the pandemic raged. In March, the central bank began raising interest rates to try to bring inflation back to its 3.75% target.      “In Brazil they had bad inflation numbers in 2020. This year didn’t start with very promising numbers either. Most of our staff, and also users in Brazil, chose crypto as a store of value and as an asset to invest in,” Mendez said.    Slow regulations    Despite the growing use of cryptocurrencies in Brazil, the regulatory framework has been inconsistent.      In 2014, Brazil’s tax authority, RFB, declared that virtual currencies will be subject to capital gains, but only if more than 35,000 Brazilian real (US$6,670) was involved in the settlement. In 2019, the RFB published guidance, requiring crypto traders to report transactions exceeding 30,000 real ($7,600 at the time) to the national treasury.      Shortly before publishing new tax requirements, Brazil’s financial authorities also announced a fintech regulatory sandbox. According to Carvalho, 32 projects applied for approval for the testing environment and more than six of them are blockchain-based projects. The sandbox will select seven projects to test fintech services for a period of one year, he added.      Crypto firms in the country are open to the proactive regulation of the space, Carvalho said. Businesses have been suffering from the lack of clarity in regulations, particularly because local banks are reluctant to work with crypto firms.      In 2018, major local banks suddenly shut down accounts connected to crypto platforms in the country, leading to an investigation by Brazil’s antitrust authority. The banks denied they had worked together to halt services to crypto firms, claiming the accounts were closed because of violations of anti-money laundering (AML) requirements. The investigation was ongoing as of last year.      Last year, Brazilian Senator Soraya Thronicke proposed a series of laws that could bring some legal clarity to Brazil’s unregulated crypto space, and could also hold scammers and fraudsters accountable. But there has been no update on the status of the proposed bill since then.      “This is something that's moving really slow, in my opinion, it will probably not evolve at a very high speed because there's a lot of lack of knowledge about the technology,” Carvalho said.      Filgueiras added that innovative initiatives, crypto or otherwise, tend to be viewed with skepticism in Brazil.      “I believe we have a long road ahead of us, given that groundbreaking ventures still struggle a lot. I hope it changes soon, but I doubt it,” Filgueiras said.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/07/consensus-2021-crypto-is-booming-in-brazil-but-regulations-lag-behind,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/007afd279ef330a82a5b7371abe288fb71e43388-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Turkish government vowed to swiftly regulate the local crypto industry after two local cryptocurrency exchanges shut down operations overnight within days of each other in April, prompting an international manhunt for the CEO of one platform. Shortly after the incidents, Şahap Kavacıoğlu, the head of Turkey’s central bank, said that crypto regulations were coming soon, although he said an outright ban was unlikely.      On May 1, Turkey added crypto platforms to the list of firms covered by AML regulations. On Thursday night, Elvan said that he doesn't see the need to rush regulations and that they should be considered and implemented carefully.      Elvan added that MASAK, Turkey’s financial crimes investigation board, has been given the authority to oversee compliance with the regulations.      According to Tansel Kaya, managing partner at the Mindstone Blockchain Labs, the government needs to provide clarity and to do so soon. “For example, the latest order talks about crypto asset service providers? What are they? Unclear,"" Kaya said.      “The government wants to access records. It's just how the mechanism is defined. Anything above 10,000 lira will be actively sent to the agency for monitoring financial crimes,” Kaya said.      As recently as March, crypto was completely unregulated in the country, and the demand for bitcoin and other virtual currencies was on the rise, fueled by the recent pressure on the Turkish lira.      But in mid-April, the government issued a ban on cryptocurrencies for payments that went into effect at the end of the month. Shortly afterward, local cryptocurrency exchanges Thodex and Vebitcoin went offline, prompting the government to speed up regulations.      During his appearance on CNN Turkey, Alvan didn't specify when the new AML regulations would take effect.      “All in all, we are going to have regulations soon,” Kaya said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/07/turkish-crypto-exchanges-must-report-transactions-over-1200-finance-minister-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6477ab34ac660d724c83cf308a2e1ca6fa9c699d-2266x1322.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

At least that's the perspective of many crypto-industry executives who predict that most, if not all, of modern finance will eventually run on digital rails. Just put it on the blockchain, as it were.      Such thinking lurks behind a new report from the World Economic Forum, the organization whose annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, has been, at least prior to the coronavirus pandemic, a venue of choice for the global financial and regulatory establishment. (Board members include European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Carlyle Group co-Executive Chairman David Rubenstein and the Indian billionaire businessman Mukesh Ambani.)      ""Many anticipate a future blurring of the lines between traditional publicly listed equities and tokenized private company shares,"" according to the report, published Thursday.      There's still a long way to go before any of this blurring is commonplace, the report suggests – partly because of friction from incumbent financial institutions and their overseers likely to resist change.      Read more: Strange Bedfellows: The World Economic Forum and Crypto      ""While greater digitization is inevitable, substantial headwinds may continue to limit adoption of distributed-ledger technology solutions, including limited leadership buy-in and uncertain business cases, the need for significant restructuring of business operations, challenges relating to bridging legacy systems with new solutions and perceptions about regulatory uncertainty,"" the report reads.      What's perhaps most notable about the 100-page report is the length to which the authors go in estimating the potential size of the traditional markets that might be ripe for disruption.      In all, it works out to $866.9 trillion:    Equity markets: $95 trillion  Debt markets: $106 trillion  Securitized products: $10 trillion  Derivatives: $560 trillion  Securities financing: repurchase agreements $4 trillion, securities lending $2.9 trillion  Asset management/fund administration: $89 trillion.    The upshot? The opportunity could be substantial for an already fast-growing crypto industry with a current market capitalization currently around $2.3 trillion.

At the Fed, Hsu was part of the supervision and regulation division, meaning he oversaw major banks.      “Mike has devoted his career to the stability and supervision of America’s banking system. He is among the most talented and principled regulatory officials that I have had the pleasure of working with, and I am confident he will execute this role with integrity and efficiency,"" Yellen said in a statement on Friday.

Setting up the system takes as little as five minutes, according to a page AWS’ Chinese website that has now been deleted, as reported by The Block on Friday.  AWS provided a brief tutorial on how to integrate the architecture, generate wallet addresses and start “farming”, the chia equivalent of mining.  Chia Network, a blockchain and smart transaction platform, published a white paper in February announcing its goal of making mining easier for individuals, letting them commit unused hard drive space to support its decentralized network.  The system is geared toward supplanting the energy-intensive proof-of-work model (as used by bitcoin) with proof-of-space-time, whereby network participants show they have been storing data over a period of time.  Created by BitTorrent founder Bram Cohen, Chia launched its platform to conduct transactions and for trading on Monday. That reportedly prompted a shortage of hard drives in China as people rushed to buy the equipment to ""farm"" the cryptocurrency.

42386690,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUZjZ,1620385208,Gold Rallies as Bitcoin Languishes Around $56K,"Bitcoin was trading sideways on Friday, even as gold rallied to three-month highs amid a renewed drop in U.S. real (inflation-adjusted) bond yields.      The cryptocurrency was changing hands at $56,500 at 11:00 UTC, continuing a week-long consolidation in the range of $52,000 to $59,000, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      Gold, a traditional store-of-value asset, rose to $1,820 per ounce, the highest level since Feb. 16. The move came a day after the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond real yield fell to a three-month low of -0.88%, per data from the U.S. Treasury Department.      ""Lower real rates boost gold which now trades below fair value,"" ByteTree CIO Charlie Morris tweeted Thursday.      The collapse in real yields was in large part responsible for risk-taking across financial markets last year, as noted by MarketWatch. In addition, some institutions poured money into bitcoin amid fears over inflation. As such, some crypto market participants became more cautious in late February and early March 2021, after a brief spike in real yields to -0.57%.      However, the latest bout of weakness in the inflation-adjusted 10-year yield is struggling so far to push bitcoin higher.      Since mid-March, the yield has dropped by 30 basis points, marking a steady increase in inflation-adjusted loss for bond investors. Bitcoin registered a moderate decline of 1% during that time-frame, while gold has responded positively, rising from $1,700 to over $1,800.      According to Bank of America, inflows into gold funds amounted to $1.6 billion in the week ended May 5, the largest in three months.      In the crypto markets, investor focus has shifted from bitcoin to ether and Ethereum-related projects like decentralized finance and layer 2 scaling. That could be the reason for bitcoin's lackluster performance of late. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, has chalked up more than 60% gains in just the past 12 days.      That said, a continued rally in gold may revive spirits in the bitcoin market, as the precious metal led the cryptocurrency higher last year.      Gold picked up a strong bid last June and surged to new record highs above $2,000 in August. Bitcoin followed suit in the final quarter, charting a near 90-degree rise to new record highs above $20,000.      History may well repeat itself this time because bitcoin funds are again becoming popular. A report earlier this week from digital-asset manager CoinShares showed bitcoin funds and investment products drew $442 million last week, having leaked a record $21 million in the preceding week.      While the declining negative real yield is currently painting a bullish picture for bitcoin and gold, some analysts are of the opinion that good times may not last long.      Also read: Bitcoin Options Traders Leaning Bearish Despite Price Recovery      ""The bad news is global tapering has begun,"" analysts at Bank of America said, adding that the process could pick up the pace in the third quarter, according to ForexLive. Tapering refers to the gradual reversal of inflation-boosting stimulus policies implemented by central banks.
