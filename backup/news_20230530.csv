13043928,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=535773,1685489445,"Raydium Prices Shot 30% 2 Weeks Ago Before Plunging, What Happened?","RAY, the native governance token of Raydium, the automated market maker (AMM) decentralized exchange (DEX) on Solana, soared 30% on May 17 before reversing gains, plunging to spot rates. RAY Prices Under Pressure According to CoinMarketCap data on May 30, RAY is changing hands at $0.19, stable against the USD, Bitcoin, and Ethereum on the last trading day. RAY has a market capitalization of $41.2 million at this rate, with an average trading volume of $2 million in the past 24 hours. At this pace, RAY remains in a bearish formation as bears peeled back gains posted on May 17, aligning the token with bears from mid-February 2023. Related Reading: Can This THORChain New Feature Push Back RUNE Bears? Like Solana and tokens based on this network, RAY’s bearish price action has persisted and hasn’t reversed losses from mid-November 2022. The collapse of FTX, a crypto exchange, and Alameda Research, the investment wing of FTX, which was heavily invested in Solana, triggered a sharp sell-off of SOL, weighing negatively on RAY and other ecosystems. Raydium Updates The sharp expansion of RAY prices on May 17 coincided with the upgrade of the Raydium DEX to version V.2.10.11. According to the development team, the decision was reached following a server load due to API abuse. Specifically, there was a nearly 3X jump in API pings in April than in March 2023. The extra load stressed Raydium’s servers, disrupting the connection. The team behind the project stated: Raydium’s APIs were pinged more than 50 billion times in April, up from 18 billion in March. May figures are set to surpass April highs. This highlights how much stress servers have been under and why issues have popped up. Nearly 2,000 new pools were created in the first two weeks of May, bringing Raydium’s total pool count to nearly 8,000. This update, V.2.10.11, served to correct this issue. Besides increasing the server capacity by 11X, there were several bug fixes that the exchange expects to “greatly improve user interface responsiveness.” While the update was received enthusiastically, momentum has waned, and RAY is trading near May 2023 lows. Trackers show that Raydium’s total value locked (TVL) is around $30 million as of May 30, down from $2.2 billion recorded in mid-November 2021. Meanwhile, there has been a noticeable drop in the number of unique active wallets (UAW) from early May 2023, according to DappRadar.

The hacker drained user funds from various Raydium liquidity pools without burning or owning any liquidity pool (LP) tokens.

42420345,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUlMp3,1685487329,Bitcoin Edges Below $28K as Investors Eye U.S. Debt Ceiling Progress,"Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $28,000 during U.S. trading hours on Tuesday but then steadied as investors monitored progress on a debt ceiling deal, whose passage remained likely but not assured.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at around $27,740, up 0.1% over the previous 24 hours, although slightly down from its higher perch earlier in the day, according to CoinDesk data.  BTC topped $28,000 on Sunday, for the first time in almost three weeks, after U.S. President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy reached an agreement to suspend the debt ceiling until Jan. 1 2025 and prevent the nation from defaulting on obligations as soon as June. The deal also means that the U.S. Treasury would likely issue around $1 trillion of debt to replenish its Treasury General Account.  “Typically, when governments issue debt that takes their debt to GDP at uncomfortable levels, that should be good news for crypto, but too many crypto companies might deal with difficult financing options over the next year,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange Oanda, wrote in a Tuesday note.  Meanwhile, traders have also revised their expectations for a more dovish, monetary turn by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The CME FedWatch Tool now shows a 66% probability that the Fed will raise interest rates 25 basis points for a fourth consecutive time at its June meeting. Only 28% expected a rate hike just a week ago.  “So far, bitcoin has moved in lockstep with liquidity,” Dessislava Ianeva, research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko, told CoinDesk. Ianeva noted that quantitative tightening (QT), which usually happens when the central bank looks to reduce its balance sheet, ""was partially offset by the Treasury spending its cash at the Fed and Bank Term Funding Program, but that push is now exhausted.”  Further rate hikes combined with QT “would definitely dampen prospects for a significant market-wide rally,” Ianeva said. “That said, other different narratives have increasingly been driving BTC markets this year such as store-of-value, NFTs, as well as technical factors such as supply/demand… (Tether has openly said they'll buy) and liquidity.”  She believes that unlike last year, BTC could show resilience amid further monetary tightening.  Among other digital assets, ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, rose roughly 0.6% to change hands at around $1,905. Payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP jumped more than 6% for the day to trade at around 52 cents, while storage protocol Filecoin's FIL token rose by 4% to trade at $4.83.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which measures overall crypto market performance, was up 0.6% for the day.  After a three-day, holiday weekend equities were mixed. The S&P 500 closed flat on Tuesday, while Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) slid 0.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was up 0.3%.  In bond markets, both 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields dropped 11 basis points to sit around 4.44% and 3.69%, respectively. Crypto prices generally operate inversely to yields.  The House is expected to vote on the debt ceiling deal on Wednesday with some hardline conservatives already indicating that they would not vote for the hard-fought package and a few progressive Democrats yet to commit. “Based on the weekend reaction to the debt ceiling news, an agreement following the vote seems likely to reflect positively on the market in the short term,” Vetle Lunde, a senior analyst at K33 Research, wrote in a weekly note published on Tuesday.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/30/bitcoin-edges-below-28k-as-investors-eye-us-debt-ceiling-progress,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/321efe35c4b636754a6e094c7adc420f2ab6208c-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

13042864,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=535767,1685485834,Chainlink Bulls Must Overcome Key Hurdle For Potential 7% Rally,"Chainlink Price has been attempting to reverse its recent losses over the past few weeks. Currently, Chainlink is trading under a crucial resistance mark which has caused the altcoin to face rejection. Over the last 24 hours, Chainlink has managed to appreciate by only 0.4%, signifying that it has been consolidating. On the weekly chart, LINK has already increased by 1.8%. Continued price consolidation will cause the bears to take over the price completely. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Receive Inflows Of 7,000 BTC, What Does It Mean? The technical outlook of the altcoin has also sided with the bears as buying strength showed signs of struggle. Both demand and accumulation have therefore remained low on the chart. As Bitcoin trades inside the $ 27,000 price zone, major altcoins have also been trying to move north on their respective charts. If Bitcoin does not stabilize above the $ 27,500 price, sellers can exert another pull on Chainlink, causing the price to fall further. The market capitalization of Chainlink declined, which indicated that buying strength remained low at press time. Chainlink Price Analysis: One-Day Chart When writing, Chainlink (LINK) was trading at $6.60. However, this price level has proven to resist the altcoin strongly. Despite this, the bulls have managed to prevent further price retracement. The overhead resistance for LINK is currently set at $6.80. LINK has been trading between $6.20 and $6.80 in recent weeks. Breaking above the upper boundary of this trading range is crucial for LINK bulls. Failing to breach the $6.80 resistance level would likely result in the dominance of the bears. If the price declines, the initial support level is $6.20. Further downside movement could see LINK trading near the $6.00 price level. The trading volume of Chainlink in the last session was low, indicating a limited number of buyers in the market. Technical Analysis For LINK Chainlink (LINK) faced difficulties attracting buyers during May and most of April. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has consistently remained below the 50-level, suggesting buyers have lost interest in LINK due to recent price rejections. Additionally, LINK has fallen below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, indicating that sellers have been driving the price momentum in the market. To regain bullish momentum, it is crucial for LINK to move above the $6.60 level, which would enable the altcoin to trade above the 20-SMA line. In contrast to other technical indicators, Chainlink (LINK) exhibited the emergence of a buy signal on the daily chart. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showed the formation of green histograms, suggesting the potential for bullish momentum to develop.

13041793,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=535766,1685482240,Is Bitcoin Poised For A Comeback To Higher Price Levels? Experts Weigh In,"Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is currently showing signs of a new momentum refresh and the beginning of a newly formed bull run. Market analyst Justin Bennet accurately predicted this move, citing recent range highs and a cluster of short liquidations in the $27,500 area. However, Bennet suggests an expected market between $27,500 and $28,250. He further claimed: Bitcoin’s pullback today is not surprising, given the aggressiveness of the weekend rally. The pullback will remain constructive as long as Bitcoin can stay above $27,500 on a 4-hour and daily closing basis. Related Reading: Can This THORChain New Feature Push Back RUNE Bears? Is Bitcoin On The Verge Of Reaching $30,000 Again? Furthermore, Bennet suggests a sustained break below Bitcoin’s current trading area would confirm a deviation and expose the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) gap at $26,900. To understand what a CME gap is, it’s important to know that Bitcoin futures are traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. When the CME closes for the weekend, there can be price movements in Bitcoin that are not reflected in the futures market. This can create a gap between the Friday close and Monday open on the CME chart, known as a CME gap. However, Bitcoin is trading above a key resistance level, as indicated by the 50-day Moving Average (MA), noted in the chart below by the brown line. This level could support Bitcoin in the short term and prevent further price drops in the $27,440 area. It remains to be seen if Bitcoin can consolidate above this key indicator and maintain its momentum. If it successfully manages to do so, the next target could be to consolidate above $28,000 and break out of the current range, as suggested by analyst Justin Bennet. This could pave the way for Bitcoin to reconquer the $30,000 level. BTC Could Reach $300,000 Or Drop To $3,000 Moreover, Bitcoin’s volatility has been compressing over time, according to trader Jackis, who believes this compression could lead to a significant price movement in 2024. He predicts that once Bitcoin leaves this compression phase in 2024, it could drop to $3,000 or soar to $300,000. Jackis further claimed that this potential price movement could mark the next stage of Bitcoin’s evolution, as it moves from the “Early adopters” phase to the “Vast majority” stage. As more individuals and institutions adopt Bitcoin, its price and volatility will likely be impacted. However, according to Glassnode co-founder James Check, the headwinds that have kept Bitcoin’s price under $30,000 include the strength of the US Dollar (DXY), a bounce in interest rates, and the risk of further Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. Nonetheless, he believes that the market may be about to turn and that Bitcoin may be poised for a rally. While the Nasdaq has been used as an indicator of Bitcoin’s potential rally, the Glassnode co-founder believes other factors are at play. He sees a potential turn in the DXY at levels of 106-107, potentially leading to a reversal in interest rates. The US Dollar Index measures the value of the US Dollar against a basket of other currencies. A stronger DXY can be seen as a headwind for Bitcoin, making the cryptocurrency relatively more expensive for holders of other currencies. Related Reading: Rare Crypto Signal Emerges That Could Spark Another 2017-Style Boom However, the Glassnode co-founder believes that the DXY may be nearing a potential turn, which could provide a tailwind for Bitcoin. Additionally, a reversal in interest rates could also provide a boost to Bitcoin’s price.

42420341,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUlMq5,1685479041,ProShares’ Bitcoin Futures ETF Underperforms BTC This Year: K33 Research,"CORRECTION (May 31, 15:05): Corrects BITO underperformance vs. BTC to 2.6% from 13.8% as K33 Research omitted monthly dividends from calculations. BITO started to pay monthly dividends to investors in February 2023.  ProShares' bitcoin (BTC) futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) is underperforming BTC this year, diminishing its appeal as a vehicle for betting BTC’s price appreciation, according to digital asset research firm K33 Research’s report.  The price of ProShares’ Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) has risen 58.7% this year until May 26, trailing BTC’s 61.3% gain over the same period, ProShares noted.  The underperformance stems from the costs associated with the fund's structure. BITO does not purchase tokens, instead it holds BTC futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The fund must roll over the contracts every month as they expire, making it vulnerable to the price difference between terms. If next month’s contract trades at a premium to the nearest expiry – a phenomenon called contango and typical during a bull market – over a sustainable period, the fund will compound losses due to the “contango bleed.”  Read more: Everything You Need to Know About Bitcoin ETFs  When BITO started trading in October 2021, several observers predicted that the fund might underperform the spot market by 10% to 13% annualized, CoinDesk reported at the time.  In its first year, the fund trailed BTC’s performance only by 1.8%, as the crypto bear market helped to mitigate the contango bleed.  This year’s market rebound exacerbated the fund’s vulnerability to rolling costs as the CME futures market returned to trade in contango. However, BITO started to distribute the fund's taxable income as monthly dividends to investors, compensating for most of the bleed. The performance gap during the year’s first five months would have been 13.8% without dividends instead of 2.6%, according to K33 Research.  Investors should expect the underperformance to ensue, K33 senior analyst Vetle Lunde said in a note. “The strong term structure remains an issue for the viability of using BITO as a tool to maintain long exposure,” he wrote in the report.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has consistently denied applications so far to list exchange traded funds that would directly invest and hold BTC, despite industry players advocating that it would be a superior product for consumers.  The underperformance “illustrates the shortcomings of futures-based ETFs compared to spot ETFs,” and how the “SEC's rigorous stance against direct BTC spot ETFs harms investors,” Lunde added.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/30/proshares-bitcoin-futures-etf-increasingly-underperforms-btc-this-year-k33-research,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/24ad8f77154b974a9a9156d33e0065fc4eaa7c39-1796x983.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

AVAX is hovering around a significant support line that has historically propelled its price in previous months. AVAX has experienced a slight 0.1% downward movement on the daily chart, while the weekly chart reflects a loss of approximately 2% in value. Related Reading: Polkadot Experiences Correction After Reaching $5.54: What’s Next In Store? Technical indicators for Avalanche indicate a bearish influence, with demand and accumulation remaining low. For buyers to regain confidence in the market, AVAX must maintain its support level and attempt to break through its resistance level. The appreciation of Bitcoin has also influenced altcoins, prompting some attempts at price increases. However, if Bitcoin’s price falls below the $27,500 mark, it is unlikely that Avalanche will be able to surpass its next price ceiling. On the other hand, if AVAX manages to break through the overhead resistance, it may experience a rally. The decrease in the AVAX market capitalization suggests that selling pressure still exists in the market. Avalanche Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, AVAX was priced at $14.48. If sellers do not exert further pressure, the altcoin will likely make gradual progress on its chart. The immediate overhead resistance for AVAX is set at $14.70, and surpassing this level could pave the way for further upward movement toward $15 and beyond. On the other hand, a decline from the current price level could bring AVAX down to $14 and potentially lower. However, if buyers step in and provide a slight push, AVAX bulls can strengthen their position in the market. The trading volume of AVAX in the last session was in red, indicating that selling strength was influencing the price action. Technical Analysis Throughout May, AVAX has experienced a lack of positive demand. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has remained below the 50-mark, indicating that sellers have outnumbered buyers. The consistent rejection at the current price level could further diminish demand. Furthermore, AVAX has fallen below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, suggesting that sellers have been dictating the price momentum at the time of writing. This indicates a bearish sentiment in the market. In line with other technical indicators, the buy signal for AVAX has been diminishing. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, which measures price momentum and reversals, has shown declining green histograms, indicating a decrease in buy signals. Additionally, the Bollinger Bands, which depict price volatility and the potential for price fluctuations, have significantly narrowed. This suggests that AVAX may experience a period of consolidation, with the potential for explosive price action in the upcoming trading sessions. Related Reading: Rare Crypto Signal Emerges That Could Spark Another 2017-Style Boom If AVAX can maintain its position above the current price level, there is a possibility that it might attempt a rally.

With the recent announcement of the long-term vision for the protocol by Andre Cronje, co-founder of the blockchain platform, the community is buzzing with excitement for the future of Fantom. Fantom’s Gas Monetization, which just went live on May 28th, is one of the most highly anticipated updates for the platform. The governance proposal was first approved in January 2023, with an overwhelming 99.8% of the votes, showcasing the community’s support for the initiative. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Receive Inflows Of 7,000 BTC, What Does It Mean? Fantom Launches Gas Monetization Program Gas monetization is an incentive program to reward high-quality dApps for their generated fees. These dApps will receive a 15% kickback on all the gas fees generated, incentivizing development and attracting more developers to the ecosystem. The money for this reward comes from the fact that the FTM burn rate will be reduced from 20% to 5%. This is a win-win situation for both developers and the Fantom network. Developers are compensated for the value they create on the network, while the network benefits from increased adoption and usage. The reduction in the FTM burn rate also helps control inflation and gives more stability to the token’s value. Francesco, a leading figure in the blockchain industry, remarked that this incentivization of development is exactly what Fantom needs to achieve its goals. With Gas Monetization, the platform is taking a significant step forward to become one of the leading L1 giants in the blockchain industry. However, the mechanism could be targeted by spam dApps and malicious actors trying to exploit it. To prevent such exploits, Fantom has implemented certain criteria that dApps must meet to be eligible for Gas Monetization. Fantom’s Eligibility Criteria A dApp must have completed at least 1 million transactions and been live on the Fantom network for at least 3 months to be eligible. These criteria are valid for each smart contract on the Fantom mainnet and may be subject to change during the program based on their effectiveness. Once approved for the program, dApps will receive 15% of the gas fees they generate. The FTM tokens received are unlocked and can be used as the dApps see fit. However, what happens to the 15% share of gas fees made by dApps that do not participate in the Gas Monetization Program? These transactions are ineligible and do not qualify for the 15% share of gas fees. The Fantom Foundation has clarified that only dApps that meet the eligibility criteria can participate in the Gas Monetization Program and receive rewards for their contributions to the network. The Foundation also reserves the right to suspend rewards to participating dApps for any necessary reason, including fraudulent user activity or the overall well-being of the Fantom ecosystem. The Gas Monetization Program is a great opportunity for dApps to showcase their value and be rewarded for their contributions to the network. However, ensuring that spam dApps or malicious actors do not exploit the program is essential. Related Reading: NFT Market Update: Major Collections Suffer Price Slump in 2023 This new approach is just a series of incentives Fantom builds to attract developers and keep them engaged with the ecosystem.

42420329,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUlMcf,1685474475,How to Manage Risk When Trading Cryptocurrency,"Cryptocurrencies are often considered to be volatile and trading them can sometimes be risky. The crypto market has also been known to experience price swings, and like every other investment, there is the chance your investment may sink in value, irrespective of how sure-shot things may seem. That said, risk management is undoubtedly one of the most important aspects of investing in cryptocurrencies.  Here are some ways to manage crypto risk.  Only invest what you can afford to lose  As with any investment, you should never invest more than you can afford to lose. This rule applies to all markets and even more so to cryptocurrencies, which can experience double-digit losses in a span of hours.  There’s no doubt that cryptocurrencies have turned several early investors into millionaires. But at the other end of the spectrum, they have left a number of novice investors in financial peril. Apart from the fact that these assets can quickly lose their value in response to ever-changing government policies, crypto trading platforms can fall victim to a hack or shutdown operations.  In 2021, dozens of people in Singapore filed police reports against a crypto trading platform called Torque. A rogue employee of the company reportedly performed unauthorized trading activities that led to significant losses and customers were restricted from using the platform.  Optimism can affect rational decision-making during market peaks, but it’s important to avoid getting caught up in the hype cycles and unsubstantiated promises. Think before investing your life savings or selling a property to buy crypto.  Move your crypto assets into cold storage  You’ve probably heard this saying from crypto folks: “Not your keys, not your coins.” Storing your assets on a centralized exchange can come with a number of risks, like site crashes, hacks and even bankruptcy. Crypto platform FTX halted withdrawals and filed for bankruptcy in November 2022, dragging much of the crypto industry down with it as it crumbled.  Transferring crypto assets to a cold storage device can mitigate some of the risks associated with trusting a centralized exchange to safeguard your funds. To clarify, a cryptocurrency exchange holds your private keys and therefore controls your assets. Cold storage, on the other hand, gives you full custody over your assets. Moreover, cold storage devices are not connected to the internet, which drastically decreases the ability of hackers and cybercriminals to access your funds. Some of the most popular cold storage devices are hardware-based and come from companies like Ledger and Trezor.  Hedge your crypto portfolio  Hedging has long been used in traditional financial markets as a form of risk management. It involves buying or selling an asset to potentially help reduce the risk of loss of an existing position or adverse price movements in an asset.  It is worth mentioning that although hedging allows you to protect your investment from adverse market swings, it also limits the potential gains from your crypto investment. Nevertheless, this is a better option than losing a significant portion of your investment.  There are several ways to hedge your crypto portfolio, such as dollar cost averaging, buying options, futures and even yield farming.  The “Dollar Cost Averaging” (DCA) strategy is one of the simplest ways to hedge a crypto investment. It entails incrementally buying or selling crypto at regular intervals rather than deploying capital in one large purchase or selling one’s entire holdings at once.  For example, let’s assume you have $1,000 to invest in Bitcoin. Instead of purchasing $1,000 worth of Bitcoin in one fell swoop, you can split your investment into $250 every week spread across a month. While you might lose some potential gains if the price of Bitcoin shoots up after your initial purchase, you’d have also saved yourself from potential losses if the price crashes.  Diversify your portfolio  When it comes to crypto or any other investment, avoid putting all your eggs in one basket. In May 2022, the price of algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST), which was supposed to be pegged to the U.S. dollar, fell to 35 cents. A few days later, its accompanying cryptocurrency, LUNA, plunged from $80 to a few cents.  Do not invest in only one cryptocurrency, regardless of your conviction. Instead, spread your investment across several digital assets. You can diversify your crypto holdings by investing in projects based on their use case or technology. For instance, Bitcoin has been touted as a store of value and might be a good way to preserve wealth. Ethereum, on the other hand, has become the largest platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts. Meanwhile, a stablecoin’s value is pegged to an underlying asset, making it typically less erratic than other digital assets. It’s good to remember that there are hundreds of cryptocurrency projects trying to achieve different things.  Avoid excessive leverage  This is more of an advanced tip, but you’d be shocked at the number of beginner traders that try to margin trade. Margin is used to increase the order size and gives you the option of going long or short. Some crypto exchanges may offer leverage as high as x100.  While the idea sounds good in theory, a 1% move against you could wipe out your entire portfolio. You could lose your entire principal during a forced liquidation.  A safer approach would be sticking to lower leverage amounts, which provide more room to not only increase your gains but also a buffer zone to exit a bad trade.  Practicing caution  As with any investment, risk is a part of the cryptocurrency trading experience and cannot be entirely removed. Rather than assume that everything will go as planned, a smart trader identifies risky areas and finds a way around them.

Bill SB 1751 passed through the state Senate unanimously in April. It would have limited bitcoin miners' participation in demand response programs – under which they get paid in credits to turn off their operations when the power grid sees a surge of demand – to 10% and abolish tax abatements for the industry.  The news that the bill wouldn't pass the House was tweeted by Dennis Porter, an advocate that has been heavily involved in the bill's process. ""This win ensures that energy innovation will continue to grow"" in the U.S. and ""highlights the power of the bitcoin community,"" Porter said in a statement to CoinDesk.  The statement emphasized the importance of the campaign mounted against the bill by Porter's organization, the Satoshi Action Fund, as well as industry groups Digital Chamber of Commerce and Texas Blockchain Council.  A House committee that would have recommended the bill to the full legislature never voted on it, the statement said.

42420344,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUlMr7,1685473521,CoinDesk Turns 10: 2021 – The Year Bitcoin Became Salvadoran,"“We die on this hill! I will die on this [expletive] hill.”  The defining crypto story in 2021 came to us by way of Strike founder Jack Mallers and this teary-eyed proclamation at Bitcoin Magazine’s Bitcoin Conference in Miami that July.  The hill was Bitcoin.  El Salvador President Nayib Bukele had just told attendees via video-link that he planned to make bitcoin a legal tender – the first country to take this momentous step. Soon, consumers would be able to use BTC alongside the U.S. dollar.  El Salvador, a dollarized country since 2001, aimed to mitigate the negative impacts that stem from being tethered to the U.S. central bank. Now the Central American state was opting into a digital currency that cannot be controlled by any central authority and can be altered, as language in the bill outlined, only in accord with “objective and calculable criteria.”  This feature is part of our ""CoinDesk Turns 10"" series looking back at seminal stories from crypto history. El Salvador’s Bitcoin Law is our choice of the most momentous story from 2021.  The Bitcoin faithful were elated at the announcement. Finally, a real, tangible first step towards widespread adoption of Bitcoin. An entire country was going to make bitcoin its currency.  Former CoinDesker Colin Harper, now of Luxor, a mining company, was covering the announcement for CoinDesk alongside CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson. They said the energy on the floor was something to behold.  “Everyone went crazy,” Harper said.  “We were scrambling behind the scenes to get an article out,” said Nelson, showing how important the news was to a publication like CoinDesk, which had been covering relatively piecemeal crypto-adoption milestones for years. He then shared screenshots of Slack messages between CoinDeskers which featured enough typos to make any copy editor blush.  The onstage performance in Miami was a flashy, vibrant affair, befitting the city itself. But the announcement wasn’t the actual hard work in El Salvador to actually make the idea a reality. That came with the passage of the country’s Bitcoin Law in September 2021. Meanwhile the U.S. Bitcoin community was heading south in droves, pursuing local Bitcoin projects in places like the surf town of El Zonte on Bitcoin Beach, a circular bitcoin economy. The work continues now there and elsewhere in the country.  But the rollout did not go smoothly over the next few months.  Before the Bitcoin Law  In 2020, a group of bitcoiners based in and building out Bitcoin Beach met with El Salvador’s Ministry of Tourism, which led to meetings with the Ministry of Economy in March 2021 and Bukele’s economic advisors. Less than three months later, the Salvadoran President made his first surprise announcement at the Bitcoin Conference.  In that group of pioneer-Bitcoiners was Mike Peterson, Director at Bitcoin Beach. Peterson bought a home in El Salvador 20 years earlier. He argues that Bukele’s move was the result of a grassroots movement and was not something top-down, as some U.S. critics have alleged.  “El Salvador’s Bitcoin movement started in El Zonte,” Peterson told CoinDesk. “It just moved quickly from ideation, meeting with economic advisors, to Bukele quickly pushing it to law. During the official passage of the law in the assembly, Bukele joined a Twitter Spaces and told thousands of listeners that the government was inspired to make Bitcoin legal tender because of how Bitcoin was transforming the lives of the unbanked in El Zonte.”  In classic Bitcoin fashion, the law’s passing was first shared with the world in the most bitcoin way possible, on a Twitter Spaces hosted by CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter.  Crazy.  Even crazier, President Bukele tweeted as far back as 2017 that El Salvador would use Bitcoin some day, right after the central bank tweeted a warning about using cryptocurrency.  After the Bitcoin Law  Once the Bitcoin Law was in place what followed is probably best described as a bit chaotic. President Bukele wanted to roll out a Bitcoin wallet as soon as possible and promised it quickly. He wanted Bitcoin ATMs set up around the country and to give every Salvadoran who downloaded the government-sponsored Chivo wallet $30 in bitcoin. The wallet was built hastily by Athena Bitcoin, then eventually rebuilt by AlphaPoint.  It was messy.  Salvadorans, meanwhile, had several misconceptions about Bitcoin, which added to the government’s rollout issues. They were not aware that Bitcoin was not President Bukele’s invention and that users would not actually be required to use the Chivo wallet and could instead use any wallet they wanted. To boot, the falling price of bitcoin at the time didn’t exactly do anyone any favors.  When the bill was announced in July 2021, BTC was trading at around $30,000. When the bill became law in September 2021, it was trading around $45,000. By September 2022, a year after the law was enacted, it was below $20,000. Any discussion around El Salvador and adoption would be incomplete without acknowledging these price swings and the bitcoin bear market.  Still, bitcoiners in El Salvador remain optimistic.  Read more: 1 Year of Bitcoin in El Salvador: The Bad, the Good and the Ugly  The CEO of Blink (aka the Bitcoin Beach Wallet) Noor El Bawab told CoinDesk in an interview that “although rollout was slow, you can still live fully on Bitcoin in El Salvador.” Noor also urged people to look at per capita numbers when discussing transaction volume (or lack thereof) in the country.  El Salvador is the smallest country in Central America, home to only about 6 million people. Of those 6 million people, Chivo amassed 3.8 million clients, according to a report from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  Now, of course, most of those 3.8 million Salvadorans could have taken the $30 and never touched bitcoin again, just as easily as those 3.8 million could still be using Bitcoin. But 2022 survey data from the U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research suggested that only four in ten Salvadorans who downloaded Chivo still use it.  Perhaps Salvadorans moved their bitcoin off the custodial, state-owned Chivo wallet into a non-custodial wallet or even into self-custody via a hardware wallet. We don’t know.  We posed this question to Noor, knowing that the Blink wallet was a custodial wallet, and she offered a sobering perspective: “It’s expensive.”  Everyone went crazy  Now when you consider that the average income in El Salvador is around $300 a month and a hardware wallet setup at a minimum costs around $100, then sacrificing one-third of a month’s income for self-custody is a tall order. It’s cheaper to use a custodial solution.  Andrew Mahowald and Pretyflaco, who works at Blink’s parent company Galoy, recently wrote in support of custodial solutions which introduces the concept of “Satoshi’s hierarchy of needs.” That argues for the use of professional Bitcoin-only custodians as an intermediate solution for those not ready for self-custody. This could be a result of Noor and Pretyflaco speaking from a biased source, given Blink is custodial, but there could be a kernel of truth in there.  Read more: As Bitcoin Scales, We Need Better Custodial Solutions  What is certain is that companies and individuals are still building Bitcoin solutions in El Salvador to this day. Even though plans for El Salvador’s utopic “Bitcoin City” fell through – which was to be built at the foot of a volcano after the placement of so-called “bitcoin bonds.” Still, companies like Galoy have cropped up and are dedicated on Bitcoin in El Salvador. Others still, like Strike, have either opened up offices in El Salvador or made some sort of public commitment to the country.  Some of the opposition  Then there’s President Bukele himself.  Although he is immensely popular in El Salvador, boasting a >90% approval rating according to some polls, the rest of the world has a problematic relationship with President Bukele, who has a reputation for authoritarian impulses.  Bitcoin advocate Alex Gladstein, Chief Strategy Officer at Human Rights Foundation, told CoinDesk over Twitter direct messages that he has mixed feelings about “the world’s coolest dictator.”  ""I continue to question and oppose the authoritarian tactics of the Bukele administration – like scrapping presidential term limits, spying on dissidents, and arresting tens of thousands of people without due process – but I consider the Bitcoin Law to be historic,” he writes. “I wish my own country [the U.S.] would add Bitcoin as legal tender, and I think it’s only fair if people worldwide could freely use an open neutral decentralized currency as opposed to a centralized, rent-seeking fiat currency.""  CoinDesk Turns 10: What We Learned From Reporting a Decade of Crypto History  The mainstream finance community has been unsupportive of Bukele’s efforts.In fact, the International Monetary Fund issued a report in 2022 which included a warning that El Salvador’s adoption of Bitcoin “as legal tender … entails large risks for financial and market integrity, financial stability, and consumer protection.”  The IMF is currently owed 287.2 million of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) from El Salvador (roughly $382.1 million, as of May 25, 2023).  The IMF then issued another report earlier this year reiterating its concerns. “While risks have not materialized due to the limited Bitcoin use so far – as suggested by survey and remittances data – its use could grow given its legal tender status … In this context, underlying risks to financial integrity and stability, fiscal sustainability, and consumer protection persist …”  There is something to be said about that on both sides.  For one, the IMF’s concern around instability in El Salvador is supportable and understandable. The price of bitcoin is volatile and volatility can be destabilizing. That said, a country can suffer greatly economically when it doesn’t control its own monetary policy. Just look at when struggling eurozone countries needed a weaker currency during the European sovereign debt crisis in the early 2010s to stimulate the economy, but instead had to suffer through endless austerity packages.  Also in this series: 2016 - How The DAO Hack Changed Ethereum and Crypto  So while El Salvador doesn’t control the monetary policies of either of its currencies, at least Bitcoin’s monetary policy is known and unchanging.  Then again, these are just IMF reports with warnings embedded, there hasn’t been much loud opposition. But on that point, Gladstein offered a sharper take on the IMF, El Salvador and Bitcoin.  ""The IMF is opposed to Bitcoin adoption in El Salvador because it gives people an escape from the debt colonialism that it imposes on much of the world,” says Gladstein “The IMF has been relatively muted in its opposition so far, in part because El Salvador is a dollarized economy and in part because the [Salvadoran] government has still sought its assistance … But if another country, let's say Argentina, adopted Bitcoin, they would enter panic mode.""  In the end …  All said, 2021 was a monumental and important year for Bitcoin and Salvadorans. If crypto lives on for many decades, the story of a sovereign nation adopting Bitcoin as its legal tender will go down in history as a critical milestone.  CoinDesk’s interviews with Salvadorans and with those in El Salvador working on bitcoin there show a good level of enthusiasm and excitement for Bitcoin. One individual working in El Salvador offered that they believed 50% of the population will use Bitcoin regularly in the next bull market.  If that happens, then 2021 will go down as the year when Bitcoin truly became Salvadoran.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | ETH | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/05/30/coindesk-turns-10-2021-the-year-bitcoin-became-salvadoran,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8b9c6015ea9052b04e34059cca4d90d3b57494c9-3000x1688.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420339,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUlMlx,1685472353,Should Russia Bolster or Ban Bitcoin?,"Another country is waffling on blockchain. Russia, the belligerent nation led by an egomaniac, has allegedly ditched plans to build a national cryptocurrency exchange, according to local reports surfaced to Crypto Twitter by Wu Blockchain’s Colin Wu. Instead, the country will write rules allowing the private sector to operate crypto exchanges, State Duma member Anatoly Aksakov reportedly said.  The plans for a government-operated crypto exchange appear to date back to 2022, around the time Russia President Vladimir Putin signed a bill banning digital asset payments in the country. At the time, the state’s legislature and central bank were locked in a debate over whether to regulate crypto or ban it outright (an option the Bank of Russia preferred).  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Since then, the government in Russia has considered introducing an “experimental legal regime” opening the door for crypto to be used in export-import deals, and tasking “special organizations” with mining crypto and processing international crypto payments. The country has also come around on the idea of using stateless currencies like bitcoin and permissionless stablecoins to skirt international sanction.  In some sense, Russia scrapping plans for a national crypto exchange – which seems always to have been unspecific or at least difficult to search on this side of the splinternet – and potentially allowing tightly-watched companies to move in is a perfect encapsulation of the rampant cronyism that’s taken root since the collapse of the USSR. It’s also a tight bow on the country’s strange stance on crypto.  (For what it’s worth, English-language publications could be overstating whether Russia ever wanted a state-run crypto exchange or mistranslating the country’s previous plans to spin up a national agency to license and supervise crypto platforms.)  Is it surprising that an autocracy has a hot and cold approach to crypto, a suite of technologies that function to undercut middlemen and despots? Putin has imposed internal capital controls to backstop a weakened ruble, in part influencing his decision to ban crypto. At the same time, he’s looked to crypto in his attempts to project power overseas. Crypto, being ungovernable, is a double-edged sword for the country.  See also: Why Russia Isn't Relying on Crypto to Evade Sanctions | Opinion  Only recently, apparently, did Russian leaders come to grasp that the use of crypto is basically inevitable and they’d be better off writing regulations than bans, as my colleague Anna Baydakova reported in April. This is especially true considering Russia has functionally been cut off from U.S. dollar-powered global economic infrastructure.  In fact, Oleg Ogienko of major Russian mining company BitRiver’s, lauded the finance ministry’s most recent move on the grounds that it would “minimize the risks of sanctions.” He added, funnily enough, private crypto exchanges would also “eliminate possible market monopolies” in a country known as much for its oligarchs as its vodka.  See also: Russia's Gazpromneft and BitRiver Partner to Develop Mining Operations  It still remains to be seen exactly which crypto exchanges will be allowed to operate, and what type of internal controls they would be required to follow. Izvestia reported the central bank would “probably” oversee these platforms (the Department of the Ministry of Finance for the Russian Federation might be another contender). It goes without saying Russian crypto exchanges would be exempt from interacting with U.S. citizens and much of the world.  Indeed, crypto occupies a curious place in the world of international politics. For years, Russian citizens have relied on stablecoins like tether (USDT) to move money in and out of the country. And yet, by and large, neither the U.S. nor EU have been all that concerned about crypto being used to avoid their economic blockades.  Crypto is undoubtedly, remarkably and increasingly useful for anyone around the world looking for a way to protect their wealth from volatile fiat currencies or government seizure. And yet, at the same time the industry does not pose much of a threat to the current order. Crypto has a penchant for over-promising and under-delivering – especially when it comes to disempowering The State.  The blockchain, instead, has become one of the most powerful financial forensic tools available to governments. Crypto is part of the reason why we have an approximation of how much North Korea earns from ransomware and internet attacks, and how U.S. investigators have tracked down digital era drug kingpins. Although crypto represents just a tiny fraction of global crime estimates, every crime committed that interacts with the blockchain becomes a potential honeypot.  See also: Who's Watching? Crypto Market Surveillance and Why It Matters | Webinar  More importantly, crypto’s success in empowering individuals is precisely why it is less of a threat in aggregate. If Russia ever really thought crypto would be used for mass evasion of capital controls, then the country failed to consider either the UX/UI issues that prevent countless people from fully integrating into the crypto economy, or how thoroughly on-ramps into crypto can be controlled. Crypto can be incredibly potent for good or bad actors looking to skirt oversight who know what they’re doing, but is essentially a worse version of Venmo for everyone else.  Crypto functions mostly as a symbol – one that borrows heavily from the U.S. highest ideals of personal liberty and sovereignty.

The former product manager, Ishan Wahi, and his brother, Nikhil Wahi, were arrested last year on charges of wire fraud conspiracy and ""wire fraud in connection with a scheme to commit insider trading."" On the same day, the SEC brought insider trading charges. In Tuesday's announcement, the SEC said the two agreed to disgorge their gains and pay interest.  Both brothers pleaded guilty to the Department of Justice charges, with Ishan Wahi now facing a 2-year sentence and Nikhil Wahi serving a 10-month sentence. The SEC said that the brothers' fines from their criminal case satisfy the civil case's settlements, and it would not seek any other penalties.  In a statement, SEC Director of Enforcement Gurbir Grewal said the alleged ""conduct is not"" new.  ""We allege that Ishan and Nikhil Wahi, respectively, tipped and traded securities based on material nonpublic information, and that’s insider trading, pure and simple,"" he said. ""The federal securities laws do not exempt crypto asset securities from the prohibition against insider trading, nor does the SEC. I am grateful to the SEC staff for successfully working to resolve this matter.""  The settlement puts an end to the court case which was set to answer the question of whether nine of the cryptocurrencies at the heart of the case were indeed securities, as the SEC has argued.

The SEC has argued that virtually all cryptocurrencies are securities, while the crypto industry maintains the position that they are not and want the SEC to publish formal guidance stating how a cryptocurrency would be deemed a security – guidance that SEC Chair Gary Gensler said is unnecessary.

13038510,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=535735,1685471413,Can This THORChain New Feature Push Back RUNE Bears?,"THORChain, a decentralized exchange and one of the liquid decentralized finance protocols by total value locked, plans to release “Lending” in 2023. It is a feature THORChain says will complete their THORFi ecosystem. However, amid this development and community anticipation, RUNE remains under pressure, slipping 32% from April 2023 highs as of writing on May 30. THORChain Lending According to THORChain, Lending will function similarly to other decentralized money markets, including one of the earliest, MakerDAO, which operates on Ethereum. With THORChain Lending, not only can the borrow deposit collateral, a token or coin already integrated by the platform, but also take loans with zero interest, liquidation, and expiry. Related Reading: Downside Threat: These Two Crypto At Risk Of Crash Due To Unlocks This arrangement means a borrower would effectively hold a loan without the risk of liquidation, irrespective of the collateral’s volatility. Moreover, THORChain says a user can be short the USD while being long on crypto assets such as Bitcoin and others. Their feature will depart from how other competing decentralized money markets operate. Most require over-collateralization, considering the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies. Borrowers will deposit collateral and create debt at a collateralization ratio (CR) set by the market. A distinction in ThorChain Lending, the protocol clarifies, is that debt will be denominated in TOR. TOR is a stablecoin that tracks the value of USD, irrespective of the collateral used, and will be non-transferable. There will be limits on collateral and risks contained by, among other factors, “slip-based fees when opening and closing loans, dynamic CR, and a circuit breaker on RUNE supply.” Loan repayment, THORChain adds, can be done at any time and in any supported asset. All repayments will be converted to TOR. Impact On RUNE RUNE serves as the utility token of the THORChain ecosystem. Using the token, users can pay for gas and use it to secure the network. RUNE plays a role in ensuring the platform is decentralized and resistant to attacks from malicious agents. With THORChain Lending, every new loan is expected to create a deflationary effect on RUNE. However, repaying the loan creates an inflationary impact. Related Reading: NFT Market Update: Major Collections Suffer Price Slump in 2023 If by the time the loan is created and closed, the price of the collateral has not moved relative to the RUNE price; there will be zero effect. However, there will be an inflationary effect if the collateral price increases versus RUNE during this time, which could negatively impact the token price if many positions are opened that meet these criteria. Ahead of this launch, RUNE prices remain flat in the last week of trading. However, it is up 7% from May 2023 lows. As of late May 2023, DeFi activity is yet to recover. According to DeFiLlama data, TVL has stagnated below $50 billion in the last five months. During this time, Uniswap, a popular multi-chain DEX, and Curve, a stablecoin DEX, have dominated activity. THORChain has a TVL of $106 million, with most liquidity from tokenized Bitcoin.

This comes after Binance Australia halted Australian dollar bank transfers earlier this month, citing its third-party payment service provider as the issue and said that it's working to find an alternative. Binance Australia will allow AUD withdrawals until June 1.  “The announcement from Binance prompted traders to sell their BTC/AUD pairs, resulting in the price reaching a historically high discount,” said Hosam Mahmoud, Research Analyst at CCData in a conversation with CoinDesk.  Bitcoin was trading at around $33,400 AUD ($21,700) on Binance compared to other exchanges such as Kraken, Coinjar and BTCMarkets, where it was trading at around $42,500 AUD ($27,700), according to CCData.  Binance Australia also had its derivatives license canceled in April, after the exchange made the request for it to be shut down.  Although the exchange assured customers that it will continue to operate in Australia, the effort hasn't successfully addressed the issue, according to Mahmoud. “This is evidenced by record-low trading volumes for the BTC/AUD pairs,” he said.  Daily trading volumes on Binance for the BTC/AUD pair were at 12,293,856.55 on May 18 prior to the announcement, and dropped to a low of 912,297.20 on May 20, according to CCData.  “According to our data, despite the significant discount, arbitrageurs are taking advantage of the lower prices, suggesting that the problem may be resolved once the funds are transferred to USDT.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING | BNB,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/30/bitcoin-trades-at-a-20-discount-on-binance-australia-following-banking-issues-in-the-country,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/59f1d1d0c7250adcbf70f80469782b3d8403aa51-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The last time it fired, the total cryptocurrency market cap climbed more than 7,000% and put the asset class on the map. With the signal now firing once again, is this a prelude to another 2017-style market boom in digital currencies? Why Crypto Could Be On The Verge Of A 2017-Style Boom Volatility is the measure of how much price varies within a timeframe. For example, an asset that rises and falls $5 either way on average is nowhere nearly as volatile as something like Bitcoin which can crash by 80% then rip higher by a 1000%. The Bollinger Bands visualize volatility over the last 20-periods using a moving average and two standard deviations. When the tools tighten, it signals a lack of volatility. When the bands expand, they signal intense volatility ahead. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Double Fractal Points To “Extended” Parabolic Rally A squeeze setup involves the Bollinger Bands tightening, then expanding to release the energy built up in the trading range. This is precisely what’s happening in the Total Crypto Market cap chart for the first time since late 2016. In the chart below, Bollinger Band Width is at the tightest in over six years. Although past performance is no guarantee of future results, the last time the signal appeared the crypto market climbed from $10 billion to $780 billion in value. A massive move is coming in cryptocurrencies | TOTAL on TradingView.com Buckle Up: Bollinger Bands Suggest Volatility Ahead The Bollinger Bands are telling us that volatility is coming, but says little about the direction of price action. For a buy signal to occur, price must close above the upper band. Until that happens, all we know is a big move is coming. Volatility, however, can resolve to the upside, despite being more so associated with downside in financial markets. The VIX, which is a measure of implied volatility in the S&P 500, is also called the “Fear Index” because it so often spikes during corrections. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Indicator Turned $5 Into $34,000 Even Oxford Languages defines the term with a negative connotation. According to the authority, volatility is the “liability to change rapidly and unpredictably, especially for the worse.” Simply put, things could also get worse for crypto. But considering the extended downtrend and evidence from the last time the signal fired, this tight of Bollinger Band Width has the potential to produce a 2017-like rally in crypto.

The network’s transaction surged to 10 million a few days after the Ordinals creator, Rodarmor, announced stepping down from the project. Related Reading: Pepecoin Eyes Rebound As It Finds Support In Strong Algorithm Data Score Reaching over 10 million inscriptions suggests that many transactions have occurred on the protocol. Casey Rodarmor tweeted that he had stepped down as the lead maintainer of Ordinals. He claimed that he was not giving Ordinal full attention and handed over the role to a programmer, Raphjaph. He further emphasized that donations from the community will fund the coder’s work on the project. Ordinals Protocol And Its Rapid Growth Bitcoin Ordinals is a protocol that supports the transcription of a unique identifier to individual satoshis (SATs) to enable easy tracking during transactions. After the launch of Ordinals in January, the protocol quickly gained popularity as a means to create new assets on the Bitcoin blockchain. Initially, Ordinals served to “inscribe” data on individual satoshis (the smallest divisible unit of BTC). However, the rapid growth in the number of Ordinals inscriptions occurred when the BRC-20 token standard was introduced in early March. Related Reading: Floki Inu: Does Meme Coin Have What It Takes To Re-Enter Top 100 Spot? This new token standard, established by the pseudonymous “Domo,” enabled users to mint new tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. According to data from BRC-20.io, in the first week, the number of Bitcoin-based tokens jumped from a hundred to 25,000 at the time of writing. The introduction of the BRC-20 token standard has expanded Bitcoin’s functionality. This increased utility has boosted the adoption and use of the Bitcoin blockchain for tokenization and asset creation. Controversy Surrounding Bitcoin Ordinals – Efficiency And Speed Concern The growth of Ordinals has not been without its share of controversy, as critics among the Bitcoin community have raised concerns about its method of “inscribing” assets on the network. They argue this approach is “inefficient and wasteful,”, particularly regarding block space and transaction fees. In response, alternative developers have been exploring using smart contracts to mint assets and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Bitcoin blockchain. They aim to address the efficiency issues associated with Ordinals by leveraging smart contracts. On the other hand, proponents of the initiative have praised Ordinals for its ability to attract new users to the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. Notably, even prominent anti-Bitcoin advocate Peter Schiff recently minted a small number of NFTs on Bitcoin using the Ordinals protocol. While the surge in Ordinals-related activity has increased BTC transaction fees, miners have greatly benefited from this heightened network engagement. According to data from Dune Analytics, miners have received over $44 million in fees related to Ordinals transactions.

On Monday, Bitcoin Miladys, the Bitcoin-based derivative of the popular Miladys NFT collection, introduced its BRC-721E token standard in collaboration with Bitcoin-based NFT marketplace Ordinals Market and Bitcoin wallet Xverse. The token standard is said to act as a bridge between the Ethereum and Bitcoin networks, allowing traders to convert their ERC-721 NFTs to BRC-721E tokens on Bitcoin.  According to the Ordinals Market website, Ethereum-based NFT holders can burn their tokens and inscribe them onto a satoshi on the Bitcoin network. Once inscribed, the tokens will automatically appear on a custom Ordinals Market collection page with complete metadata.  It’s worth noting that while the new standard allows for the conversation of ERC-721 NFTs to Ordinals NFTs, metadata is initially not stored on-chain. Ordinals Market provides a number of options that allow for on-chain previews of the NFT, which can be displayed in existing wallets or marketplaces.  According to data from Dune Analytics, ordinals surpassed 10 million inscriptions Monday, a substantial leap from the 3 million inscriptions reported in the first week of May. Last week, Bitcoin climbed to the number two spot on the leaderboard for NFT trading volumes in terms of network, according to data platform CryptoSlam, blazing ahead of Solana and trailing just behind Ethereum.  The growth is sizeable considering the Ordinal protocol has only existed since January.  More recently, NFT marketplaces have been opening up their support for Bitcoin NFTs.

42410553,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdfWI5,1685466806,U.S. CFTC Warns About Clearing Derivatives Tied to Digital Assets,"U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) staff are warning companies to be wary of and actively counter risks from clearing digital asset transactions, and Commissioner Kristin Johnson said the agency should turn this advisory into a full-blown rule-writing effort.  The CFTC's Division of Clearing and Risk sent out the advisory on Tuesday, saying it would put a special focus on the emerging risks in crypto in response to an upswing in its supervised entities clearing such trades. These risks include potential conflicts of interest, protections against cyber threats and how firms are managing physical delivery of digital assets in transactions requiring delivery.  The agency said it expects companies “to actively identify new, evolving, or unique risks and implement risk mitigation measures tailored to the risks.”  Commissioner Kristin Johnson followed the agency's statement with one of her own, calling on the CFTC to start a formal process to set up new rules.  ""We observe increased registration activity for crypto-commodity derivatives clearing and note that several proposed models adopt a non-intermediated market structure,"" she said in a Tuesday statement. “Unless we introduce parallel regulation, these crypto-commodity derivatives clearing models may not be subject to the most rigorous regulatory standards.”  Some crypto firms – including the former FTX.US subsidiary, LedgerX – have joined the ranks of derivatives clearing organizations overseen by the agency. A LedgerX effort to set up direct crypto clearing without go-between firms – famously pushed by ex-FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried – was later abandoned, but it opened up a controversial possibility that remains unresolved.  Johnson argued that the CFTC's new advisory illuminates the need for something more – “a rulemaking process to explore the unique challenges of introducing customer protections in non-intermediated crypto-markets.”  When such a regulator issues public warnings about certain activities, as the agency did Tuesday, it’s often followed later by sanctions in that arena. Meanwhile, the CFTC has already been pursuing major enforcement actions against crypto companies, including a recent action against Binance’s global operations.  The derivatives regulator directly regulates crypto futures and has an enforcement reach into fraud and manipulation of spot markets for the trading of non-security crypto assets. It’s expected to have a wider future role as an industry watchdog, but bills that would enhance its authority haven’t yet moved through Congress.

In supporting its expansion into the renewable energy sector, Tether said it's recruiting experts in the space. The traditional process of mining bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is energy-intensive due to competition among miners who race to verify transactions on the blockchain in return for rewards. “By harnessing the power of Bitcoin and Uruguay’s renewable energy capabilities, Tether is leading the way in sustainable and responsible Bitcoin mining,” said Paolo Ardoino, chief technology officer of Tether. “Our unwavering commitment to renewable energy ensures that every Bitcoin we mine leaves a minimal ecological footprint while upholding the security and integrity of the Bitcoin network.” The move comes after Tether laid out a new investment strategy earlier this month that would ""strengthen and diversify"" the reserves that back its dollar-pegged USDT ( USDT-USD ) stablecoin. As of the end of March, the company revealed that it held some $1.5B worth of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). Tether pointed out that Uruguay is a big player in renewable energy production, having achieved 94% of electricity generation from renewable sources , chiefly wind and solar power. Publicly-traded companies involved in eco-friendly BTC mining include: Greenidge Generation ( GREE ), Iris Energy ( IREN ), Marathon Digital ( MARA ), Bitfarms ( BITF ) and Hut 8 Mining ( HUT ).

Here’s what this may mean for the asset. Bitcoin Miner Netflow Has Registered A Large Positive Spike As an analyst in a CryptoQuant post pointed out, Poolin mining pool seems to have been behind most of the recent inflows. The relevant indicator here is the “miner netflow,” which measures the net amount of Bitcoin entering or exiting the wallets of all miners. When the value of this indicator is positive, these chain validators are now depositing a net number of coins into their addresses. Such a trend can indicate that the miners are accumulating currently, which can be bullish for the price. On the other hand, values of the metric below zero imply this cohort is taking coins out of their wallets. The main reason why these investors would transfer their coins away from their addresses is for selling-related purposes. Thus, this kind of trend can have bearish implications for the asset. Now, here is a chart that displays the trend in the Bitcoin miner netflow over the past year and a half: The value of the metric seems to have been quite elevated during the past day | Source: CryptoQuant The above graph shows that the Bitcoin miner netflow has observed a pretty large positive spike during the last day or so. With this sharp rise in the indicator, the miners have received 7,000 BTC in their wallets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Hopes Still Alive, If This Metric Is To Go By This is quite an extraordinary amount, as no other spike has come close during the last one and a half years. Naturally, if these net inflows indicate that the miners have been buying, the cryptocurrency could feel a bullish boost. In January, for example, the miners participated in some possible buying, as the netflow registered a significant spike. Following these inflows, the price started its rally. The quant cautions, however, “It is important to note that having such a large influx of BTC into miners’ wallets does not necessarily guarantee a bullish movement in the price of Bitcoin. Similar situations have occurred in the past where there were significant inflows into miners’ wallets, but the price of Bitcoin subsequently declined.” The analyst also points out that 99% of these net flows seem to have involved just one mining pool in the sector: Poolin. The chart below shows the trend in the combined holdings of the miners in this pool. Looks like the metric has spiked recently | Source: CryptoQuant Since the net Bitcoin inflows are mostly to the wallets of this mining pool, it’s unlikely that they represent the sentiment among the wider mining industry, regardless of whether they are a sign of buying or not. Related Reading: XRP Bullish Signal: Address Activity Spikes To Historical Levels From the chart, it’s visible that last month, following the local top in the asset’s price, Poolin appears to have sold many coins.

Titled “Maschine,” the collection by van den Dorpel is supported by Mercedes-Benz NXT, the car manufacturer’s new Web3 arm that focuses on digital collectibles and virtual experiences.  The collection features 1,000 unique Ethereum-based tokens and plays on themes of velocity and perception, as the artwork mimics a wheel in motion. The sale opens as a Dutch auction on June 7.  According to a series of tweets, Mercedes-Benz NXT plans to release three “core” collections planned, developed and managed by the creative studio 0xNXT. It also plans to include satellite and peripheral projects within its NFT ecosystem.  Van den Dorpel told CoinDesk that Mercedes-Benz’s emphasis on innovation and aesthetics relates to his practice of creating generative art.  “It was an honor to be asked for this drop and be given the trust to make a truly generative experimental art piece,” said van den Dorpel. “The technical features given by blockchain have helped consolidate the fluid character of digital art in all its variations, in terms of ownership, provenance and conservation.”  Luiz Ramalho, Fingerprints DAO founder, told CoinDesk that working with Mercedez-Benz NXT bridges the gap between emerging digital art and the traditional art world.  “Regular people that are mostly unaware of the developments in the Web3 space are likely to have their attention drawn to a collaboration like this… we can make them see that there is substance to artworks being made over here, artworks that couldn’t possibly be done without the use of these new technologies,” said Ramalho.  Fingerprints DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization, has curated a gallery of NFT art selected by a community-elected Curation Commitee. Its collection includes a number of Autoglyphs by Larva Labs, Loot Bags and other works that it has deemed “inimitable and irreplaceable.”  Last week, Mercedes-Benz introduced Mercedes-Benz NXT, which it hails as a “long-term commitment to building a dedicated presence within the Web3 community.” According to its website, the new team aims to bring the collectibility of its vehicles and memorabilia to the digital realm and touch on all of the Mercedes-Benz brands and product portfolio.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | TRADING | ZRX,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/05/30/mercedes-benz-web3-arm-to-release-nft-collection-with-digital-art-community-fingerprints-dao,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a14955f4cd4ebc2c98f8ae5b972c7074fa9e480f-1293x896.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

13059811,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/05/crypto-ai-spikes-post-debt-ceiling-agreement,1685462257,Crypto AI spikes post debt ceiling agreement,"A debt ceiling agreement appears to have been reached, but a vote is still needed. Crypto AI tokens are rising strongly. Still some way to go to agree debt ceiling Amid mutterings of discontent about the debt ceiling deal, especially on the Republican side, the issue is due to be put before the House. Republican lawmaker Chip Roy put it into perspective by remarking in a tweet on Sunday: “they haven’t been educated yet on what a t*rd-sandwich this “deal” is. They will be.” Republicans and Democrats need to get the deal voted on and passed by June 6. Should they fail to do so, a most unlikely scenario, the US government would default on its debt for the first time in history. Crypto is a hedge out of the debt debacle Bitcoin and crypto are receiving an advantage of the uncertainty as investors dip their feet into the asset class in order to diversify and hedge their risk. However, it’s not the entire crypto sector that is benefiting. Bitcoin and ethereum are looking strong, as are some of the more fundamentally sound tokens, although the sector as a whole is still flat after the crypto rally from the beginning of the year - that is with the exception of the artificial intelligence niche. AI tokens make strong moves to the upside Certain of these AI tokens have surged considerably today. Ocean (OCEAN) has been one of the most prominent of the AI crypto tokens to make some great gains in the last several hours. From a price of $0.34 OCEAN rose as high as $0.39 - a 14% increase. Now the token looks to be forming a flag at the upper limit of a trendline formed since early February. A further break to the upside is a possibility. SingularityNET (AGIX) is another trendline breaker. It has managed 13% in all today, but the price is still to come back and retest the trendline before potentially going much higher. Possibly the most successful of the AI tokens so far today is Matrix.ai (MAN). MAN surged more than 30% in just the last two hours, taking it to a price of just under $0.32. The price has since returned to $0.30, but there does appear to be more in the tank for a potential move higher. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42410543,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdfVoK,1685460752,FTX Examiner Appointment Referred to Court of Appeals by District Judge,"The appointment of an independent investigator into the collapse of crypto exchange FTX was on Tuesday referred to the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals by a Delaware District Judge.  The government has joined a bipartisan grouping of Senators to call for an independent inquiry into the fall of Sam Bankman-Fried’s empire, despite warnings from FTX’s new management the probe could cost the estate around $100 million in legal costs.  In a Tuesday ruling, District Judge Colm F. Connolly argued the matter was out of his hands, as the law compels him to refer the case upwards if the U.S. Trustee, a branch of the Department of Justice (DOJ) concerned with bankruptcy, asks for it, and if there’s no dispute over facts.  “No one contests that the Trustee requested an examiner here or that the debtor's fixed, liquidated, unsecured debts, other than debts for goods, services, or taxes, or owing to an insider, exceed $5 million,” Connolly’s ruling said, adding that all that remains is a legal question – whether the bankruptcy code compels an independent probe.  In March, John Dorsey, a judge from a bankruptcy court, declined to appoint an examiner into the case, saying it could represent a costly delay to the wind-up of the network of around 100 companies.  FTX filed for bankruptcy in November. Bankman-Fried, FTX’s former chief executive officer, is battling DOJ charges including wire fraud, while filings by his successor John J. Ray III have hinted at a reboot of the exchange’s activity.  In January, independent examiner Shoba Pillay found that Celsius had used new customer funds to pay for withdrawals, after she was asked in September to investigate whether the bankruptcy crypto lender had operated as a Ponzi scheme.

After going live last August, Canto experienced a now-familiar hype cycle in which it enjoyed a euphoria-filled first coupe of months that saw its TVL jump from less than $1 million to more than $110 million. It's since suffered multiple 60% corrections along with periods of consolidation.  Alongside, the blockchain's native token CANTO has tumbled, including a fall of more than 55% over the past six weeks to $0.16, according to Cryptowatch data.  Canto is a blockchain that was designed for DeFi services like lending, staking and liquidity provision. Since its inception, it has seen a total of $591 million bridged from Ethereum's mainnet, but that figure has stagnated over the past month as daily inflows struggle to top $3 million versus more than $20 million seen earlier this year, according to data from Dune Analytics.  Canto's difficulties aren't necessarily related to to its products and services – it has a capable DEX and several decentralized apps (dapps) that can be used to generate a yield. The issue instead may be the fickle nature of crypto investors – as hype recedes, so does the appetite of users.  The overall total value locked on DeFi protocols has shrunk from $53 billion to $48 billion since April 15, according to DefiLlama, with liquidity continuing to get sucked into a black hole of meme coin rug pulls and derivatives markets.  As seen during DeFi Summer a few years back, innovation will be key in order for DeFi to make a comeback.  The recent lack of innovation has resulted in a series of copycat lending protocols that only differ in branding and user interface. As the narrative of TradFi using DeFi to generate a yield continues to subside, DeFi developers need to think outside the box with unique offerings – something that will lure fragile crypto liquidity back from ""get rich quick"" schemes like meme coins.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH,Oliver Knight,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/05/30/the-plight-of-hyped-blockchain-canto-demonstrates-dreary-defi-outlook,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8ed7eb37f74c7af50076d90f9d4766985dd1f4a1-3684x2072.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, the picture could turn red in the short term for some altcoins as unlocks season kick-off. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Faces Dilemma As New Addresses Take Conflicting Positions As of this writing, Ethereum trades at around $1,900 with sideways price action in the last 24 hours. In the past week, the cryptocurrency traded in the green but has been outperformed by altcoins, such as XRP, Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and its synthetic version Lido Staked Ether (stETH). Crypto Unlocks Jeopardize Altcoin Sector According to an analyst at Scimitar Capital, the native token for the Ethereum-based scalability solution Optimism (OP) and the native token for the Sui Network (SUI) are poised for a major retrace. These two tokens will unlock a big chunk of their supply soon. In the past, any uptick in circulating supply for a token led to increased selling pressure in the market. The more supply, the less demand for the crypto, which translates into downside price action. The analyst claims that SUI will see a 13% unlock on its market capitalization, meaning $67 million in the token, at current prices, is about to enter the market. On the other hand, OP is about to see a spike of over 110% in its market cap. In other words, around $580 million in OP will flood the altcoin market; according to the analyst, the likely scenario is for the token to succumb to downside pressure: Optimism has a massive unlock this week with over 114% of the current circulating supply unlocking. All else held equal, this means the token should trade much lower than it is now, as price is a function of supply and demand more supply = lower price. If the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can’t push upside and break out of their current range, then SUI and OP are likely to re-test critical support. Other altcoins could face a similar fate as market conditions worsen. Unlocks Season Hints At Bearish Pressure, But Shorting Is A Bad Idea? However, the team behind Optimism announced an important upgrade for the network. The second layer solution will lower fees and increase performance one week after unlocking the OP supply. There have been other announcements regarding the state of this network and its development. The analyst believes that this is part of a strategy to offset the unlocks and warn traders against shorting the token, despite the unfavorable conditions: (…) consider who you are trading against the investors and team are incentivized to coordinate and fuck over presellers as much as possible. Do you really want to pvp vs a16z and paradigm and the optimism insiders? As mentioned, SUI is likely also to continue seeing downside price action. Despite unlocking fewer tokens than OP, the Sui Network team has a weaker strategy to counter the potential selling event, which could provide a better opportunity for traders.

It’s a mandatory lesson for life if you’re interested in having the best shot at success and having that elusive result only a small portion of traders end up having – more profits than losses. In today’s world of high inflation, increasing interest rates and strained geopolitical tension, opening positions across a variety of different asset classes is more important than ever. The Exness Trade App makes this task seamless and convenient. As a one-stop-shop platform, the app offers the entire A-Z trading journey, from sign-up to withdrawal. More importantly, it offers a diverse range of instruments, including a bountiful selection of cryptocurrency CFDs alongside the more traditional markets. Unlike some other trading apps on the market, Exness Trade provides a comprehensive trading experience for anyone looking to put their eggs in as many baskets as possible. Why having the crypto trading option matters Exness opens the door to the next level of portfolio diversification – the ability to spread your capital across a very wide range of crypto prices against the USD, Gold, the Aussie Dollar, and more. Exness Trade App gives access to all of the broker’s cryptocurrency products through its MT5 trading accounts. That means you can trade the price of 25+ crypto CFDs on offer against the US Dollar – from the biggest market players in Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum to the lesser-known 1inch, Polkadot, and Elon Musk’s favorite Dogecoin. Exness is also one of the very few brokers who offer you the opportunity to trade Bitcoin’s price against metals like Gold and Silver. Beyond having access to such an impressive portfolio of cryptos, trading with Exness Trade App comes with a whole slew of features that can propel your crypto trading to new heights. Features for an immersive crypto trading experience What makes the Exness Trade App really stand out is the way it allows users to monitor and analyze their trading performance, as well as its customization capabilities. Since there is such a large collection of cryptocurrencies on offer, you have options to tailor your app experience so that you keep quick track of the cryptos you care about. For example, in the Performance section, you can analyze your overall trading history for instruments like BTCXAU, BTCUSD, DOTUSD, DOGEUSD, and ETHUSD in terms of profit and loss by looking at different time periods and time categories. Four different time periods – 7, 30, 90, or 365 days – and three different time categories – General period, Time intervals, or Data slices – help you perform a deep dive into your profitable and non-profitable historical crypto orders. Sifting through all the instruments in the app is made much easier by the three different ways you can view them: Favorites – you can tag any crypto instrument you’d like as a favorite, such as BTCXAU, DOTUSD, or DOGEUSD, and it will be grouped here. Popular – a category that is automatically updated based on the overall number of orders from all Exness traders. See how popular crypto trading is with other traders and adjust your strategy accordingly. Top movers – a list that is refreshed every time the app is loaded, featuring 10 instruments with the highest percentage of daily price changes (top five bullish and top five bearish). Keep an eye out for any big movers in the crypto market here. For the ultimate personalized experience, crypto traders can set up personalized push notifications on the Exness Trade App, as well as bid and ask price alerts, for specific cryptocurrency CFD instruments or events. Multiple alerts can be set up for a single instrument, such as BTCUSD or ETHUSD, and the app stores a history of your alerts until you decide to clear it. This way, you’ll never miss a minute of the crypto market action that you care about the most. Beyond these stand-out features, the Exness Trade App also offers more standard, but extremely useful, tools to help you navigate the crypto markets. Things like margin, swap, and spread calculators, economic calendars, trading signals, and the latest news help you hone your trading strategies, while different chart layouts, popular indicators, and the ease of setting up take profit and stop loss orders help to sharpen the technical side of your trades. Trading the more traditional markets for next-level diversification Besides cryptocurrency CFDs, the Exness Trade App also caters to traders interested in more traditional markets, or those looking to diversify their portfolio beyond just crypto assets. Users can access a vast array of CFDs in forex, metals, indices, energies, and stocks. Metals, for example, include a range from the most popular Gold vs. USD (XAUUSDm) with an extended swap-free option, to the rare Palladium (XPDUSDm) that you won’t find with many other brokers. This kind of versatility applies to all the other asset classes, allowing traders to capitalize on a multitude of opportunities across different market sectors and adapt their strategies according to changing market conditions. Exness has built an app that ensures a comprehensive trading experience, whether you’re a seasoned crypto trader, a beginning trader, or anyone in between.

13059807,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/05/qwan-launches-as-the-decentralized-gaming-token-for-ethereum,1685455200,QWAN Launches as the Decentralized Gaming Token for Ethereum,"Ethereum has a lot of tokens – tens of thousands in fact. In the poly-token era, there is a token for everything. Gaming is no exception. On the surface, therefore, QWAN, a token supporting a decentralized economy for gamers, would appear to be late to the party. Maybe so, but there is enough about the project to suggest it has the potential to dominate its sector and to become Ethereum’s de facto gaming asset. Let the Games Begin The case for creating a universal digital currency for gamers is a compelling one to say the least. There are over three billion of them, they’re tech literate, and there is a significant crossover with crypto holders. If anyone is going to “get” crypto, it’s gamers. This unbridled potential, however, has to be countered with the acknowledgement that thus far a universal gaming token has yet to emerge. This is surprising given the number of attempts at fostering a token-based mechanism for social sharing and driving positive economic behaviors. Creating a widely adopted gaming token is in itself a game that has yet to claim a winner. So what does QWAN possess that affords it a realistic prospect of triumphing where other tokens have foundered? Well, for one thing it’s got the requisite ecosystem partners onboard, which is imperative when launching a project of this magnitude. Gaming platform and marketplace Banger will be supporting the QWAN launch, while web3 advisory and solutions provider Horizen Labs Ventures (HLV) is supplying strategic advice. The strongest argument in favor of QWAN succeeding, however, is that it is not allowing itself to be pigeon-holed into niche communities or specific gaming categories. GameFi is a broad term incorporating any type of game that includes a blockchain component, and QWAN’s architects have deliberately targeted as wide an audience as possible. When Token, Why Token? On May 31, QWAN will be listing on a series of exchanges including MEXC, AscendEX, and BTSE at a starting price of $0.15. Thereafter, it’s a case of watching to see how its ecosystem expands and use cases evolve. The idea is that gaming communities and projects will choose to integrate QWAN due to the token’s ability to align economic incentives between participants. As an open and permissionless digital token, anyone can build with it, trade it, or create games that utilize it while tapping into the network effects that come from having a broad and distributed ownership base. “We are excited about QWAN and its potential to positively impact and shape game economies, powering new utilities and a community-led governance that can appeal to existing web2 gamers,” says HLV’s Rohan Handa. “With the gaming token being adopted and integrated by the Banger platform, we believe QWAN can onboard the next wave of users to web3 and push the gaming industry forward.” That’s the bull case for QWAN. The more gaming communities it enters, the stronger it will become. It will take time for this vision to manifest. But the rewards, if QWAN can fulfill its ambitious objective of reaching millions and ultimately billions of gamers, are huge. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Amid this exciting surge, Tradecurve is in its presale phase, which is garnering substantial interest from investors keen on getting in on the ground floor. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) has experienced a downturn, underscoring the ever-volatile nature of the crypto market. Let's break down each of these movements in more detail. >>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW Tradecurve (TCRV) the world's first Defi hybrid trading exchange Tradecurve is a hybrid trading exchange that gives users direct access to stocks, commodities, cryptocurrencies, and the forex market — all through one easy-to-use account. With Tradecurve, you can bid goodbye to the often time-consuming KYC checks that other traditional platforms necessitate. In a remarkable step towards user privacy, Tradecurve intends to allow fully anonymous trading across all financial markets. Starting to trade on Tradecurve is as simple as it gets: create an account with an email, link your crypto wallet, and make your initial deposit. No longer are the financial markets a world away for novice traders — Tradecurve is making them accessible to everyone. As it's built on the principles of decentralization, Tradecurve empowers users to maintain absolute control over their assets and private keys. Furthermore, with the upcoming implementation of the Proof of Reserves (PoR) protocol, Tradecurve will add another layer of security and transparency. TCRV is the utility token for Tradecurve and can be used to enjoy fee discounts, staking rewards, account upgrades, and more. TCRV is currently only available through the presale, which has already seen the sale of 45+ million tokens and a 50% price pump to $0.015. This impressive performance has been triggered by analysts predicting the price to approach the $1.00 level on public launch. XRP price surging by more than 10,000% XRP is a digital asset native to the Ripple network. The main use case of the XRP token includes remittance services, instant money transfers, and even e-commerce. XRP saw massive institutional adoption in 2018, with the XRP price surging by more than 10,000% to reach a market capitalization above $119 billion. XRP failed to sustain its price momentum and the asset's market capitalization plummeted to just $7 billion in 2020. This XRP drop can be blamed on the crypto-wide bear market, but the SEC's lawsuit against Ripple Labs also played a significant role. However, XRP has proved to be a resilient asset with a loyal community, as the XRP price has recovered by over 50% since early 2023. The bullish news doesn't end there as XRP is currently building a platform for CBDCs and is attempting to become the go-to asset for banks, especially within Asia. Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction Cardano (ADA) is not faring quite as well as XRP and Tradecurve — the asset has seen its price take a hit as it loses ground in the competitive layer-1 blockchain space. Cardano (ADA) had a market capitalization of over $90 billion in 2021 but this has fallen to a current market cap of $12.38 billion and a price of $0.36 per Cardano (ADA) token. Analysts believe that this Cardano (ADA) drop could be due to the increased competition in layer-1 blockchain projects, with Ethereum (ETH) and the layer-2 projects posing the biggest threat to Cardano (ADA). This is further compounded by Cardano (ADA)’s slow development process and lack of adoption. Price-wise, it is expected that Cardano (ADA) will range between $0.30 and $0.42 until the wider crypto market enters a sustained bullish phase. A move below $0.30 is not out of the question, which could see Cardano (ADA) plummet further to $0.18-$0.20.

The firm is collaborating with a “local licensed company” and is actively recruiting, according to the release, which did not disclose amounts of the investment or the partner firm.  Tether expects that the mining facility will start operating by mid-Q3 this year, a company spokesperson told CoinDesk.  The news comes after Tether laid out plans earlier this month to allocate a part of its profits to bitcoin investments, including regular purchases of BTC and funding infrastructure. Alongside that announcement, the company revealed its first bitcoin purchases, saying it held about $1.5 billion of the crypto as of the end of March.  “By harnessing the power of Bitcoin and Uruguay's renewable energy capabilities, Tether is leading the way in sustainable and responsible Bitcoin mining,"" Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s chief technology officer, said in the press release.  South America has seen increasing attention from overseas crypto investors, specifically bitcoin mining, thanks to a drying up of opportunities in North America. Uruguay's neighbor Paraguay has experienced an influx of miners looking to tap into its unused hydropower, though this has caused a stir in that country's political and energy systems.  Tether’s USDT is the largest stablecoin on the market with an $83 billion capitalization. The token is mostly backed with assets like U.S. government-issued debt, but also gold and a stash of secured loans to undisclosed parties. Rising yields over the past year-plus have proven to be a boon for the company, contributing to its $1.5 billion in net profits for the first quarter of 2023.

42410561,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdfWfE,1685452916,Bitcoin Mining Difficulty’s Record Setting Streak Shows No Signs of Stopping,"The bitcoin mining difficulty - a measure of how easily miners can discover a block of bitcoin - is set to surpass the 50T mark on Wednesday, setting a new all-time high, and it’s could continue to grow further.  The rally in bitcoin prices this year and rise in popularity for the Ordinals protocol has led to better profitability for the miners, and miners are continuously deploying more mining machines, as planned. These factors contribute to more computing power, which leads to record difficulty levels.  The bitcoin mining difficulty adjusts automatically as the more computing power, or hashrate, gets added to the network, in order to keep the time required to mine a block stable at about 10 minutes.  “New-generation machines will continue to get plugged in as rack space is made available,” said Ethan Vera, chief operating officer at mining services firm Luxor Technologies.  Read more: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty: Everything You Need to Know  Meanwhile, the popularity of the ordinals protocol has led to transaction fees three times higher than normal, adding to miners’ revenue, Vera said.  Ordinals enable additional functionality on the bitcoin blockchain, such as non-fungible tokens and other coins, which in turn increase the number of transactions, making mining a block more profitable.  An increase in difficulty means a decline in profitability for miners because their chances to win any single block, and bring in revenue, becomes slimmer. Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), one of the biggest miners, noted that its monthly mined bitcoin was lower, month-on-month, as difficulty rose in April. Similarly, Canadian miner Bitfarms (BITF)’s fourth quarter slid to a loss due to higher difficulty.  Read more: Bitcoin’s High Fees Brought Back Bull Market-Level Mining Revenue, But Not for Long  However, a few events could dampen the growth of the hashrate.  The lack of positive bitcoin price movement and constraints in available infrastructure could be some of those catalysts, according to Tim Rainey, Treasurer at Greenidge Generation Holdings (GREE).  Uncertainty around the next Bitcoin halving event could also slow down the increase of mining difficulty, according to Charles Chong, senior manager of business development at Foundry.  Foundry is owned by CoinDesk’s parent company, Digital Currency Group.  Meanwhile, having too much hashrate in one region could also affect the growth of the bitcoin mining difficulty as it may change how mining rigs are deployed.  “Given the concentration of hashrate in North America, we are seeing new seasonal trends,” said Colin Harper, head of content and research at Luxor Technologies. Previously, the hashrate would increase during China’s rainy season, when cheap hydropower was plentiful.  Instead, now, when summer heatwaves sweep through the U.S., miners power off their machines to save the energy required for cooling.

The measures that went into effect Tuesday afternoon local time include restrictions on transfers from the exchange to platforms that don't comply with Travel Rule Universal Solution Technology (TRUST), a system kick-started by U.S.-based crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) to ensure firms comply with FATF's requirements.  The exchange has set notification requirements for receiving and sending crypto to TRUST-compliant platforms in a list of 21 countries, which includes Japan, Israel, Gibraltar, Hong Kong, the Bahamas and Switzerland. BitFlyer further restricts transfers to complaint platforms in these countries to TRUST-compatible crypto assets such as bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and several ERC-20 tokens.  Transfers to and from countries not on this list, as well as transfers to private wallets, can be made in any crypto asset available on the bitFlyer platform, the company said.  In accordance with these measures, domestic crypto transfers to and from bitFlyer can be made only to Coincheck, the other TRUST-compatible platform in Japan – and only via bitcoin.  Japan recently vowed to implement FATF's travel rule, which mandates the sharing of crypto transaction information between platforms after the watchdog urged advanced economies grouped in G-7 to take the lead in combating money laundering through digital assets.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin (BTC) climbed above $28,000 after an agreement on a deal to raise the U.S. debt ceiling, but the crypto still appears on track for its first monthly loss since December. The leading cryptocurrency by market value traded as high as $28,400 late Sunday, up from about $25,900 the previous week. At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at just under $28,000. Prices, however, were still down about 5% for May in what would be the first monthly decline of the year, assuming things hold through Wednesday. Ether (ETH) at the moment is up modestly in May after trading in a tight range for most of the month. Analyst Matteo Bottacini at Crypto Finance AG said in a morning note that he sees potential for ether and other altcoins to outperform thanks to positive narratives surrounding the Ethereum network, such as the all-time high in staked ether.  The European Central Bank (ECB) has finalized prototypes for a digital euro as it prepares to take a decision later this year over whether to develop the EU's fiat currency in a new format, according to reports released on Friday. The ECB says its potential central bank digital currency (CBDC) can be designed to boost innovation, but appears more skeptical about using Web3-style distributed ledger technology and smart contracts. “This exercise shows that it is possible to smoothly integrate the digital euro design choices into the existing payment landscape while leaving ample scope for innovative features and technologies,” ECB Executive Board member Fabio Panetta said in a letter to the European Parliament’s Irene Tinagli, adding that findings “will serve as input for both the functional and technical design of a digital euro.”  Criminal charges against Sam Bankman-Fried – including technicalities around his extradition back to the U.S. and campaign finance violations – are valid,prosecutors said in court filings from Monday. U.S. lawyers were responding to early May pretrial motions from Bankman-Fried’s attorneys to dismiss most charges levied against him. Lawyers for the former head of failed crypto exchange FTX cited procedural issues, the irrelevance of some U.S. laws given FTX's non-U.S. location, and allegations that exceeded the agreed extradition terms. Bankman-Fried’s motions did not seek to dismiss securities fraud and money laundering charges. With regards to Bankman-Fried’s argument that the Bahamas needed to approve any charges prior to extradition, prosecutors contended that the U.S. treaty with the Caribbean nation allows for post-extradition charges with the consent of the extraditing country, and any charges presented post-extradition in new indictments do not violate this rule.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows 1.4 million addresses have accumulated over 700,00 bitcoin in the price range of $27,167 and $27,976.  The range is likely to act as a solid support, according to onchain analyst Ali Martinez.

13031490,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=535687,1685449005,Shiba Inu Price Faces Dilemma As New Addresses Take Conflicting Positions,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) finds itself amidst a contrasting scenario. Holders of the meme coin and newly emerging addresses are taking conflicting positions, leading to a state of uncertainty. Some long-standing holders remain steadfast in their belief in the token’s potential, having weathered its volatile journey thus far. On the other hand, fresh addresses, intrigued by the recent buzz surrounding SHIB, bring with them a mix of skepticism and curiosity. This contrasting sentiment within the community creates a dynamic landscape, ripe with possibilities. However, there remains a glimmer of hope as the trust of whales and the potential for wider adoption may play crucial roles in shaping the future of the token. Related Reading: Pepecoin Eyes Rebound As It Finds Support In Strong Algorithm Data Score New Addresses Up, Signaling Growing Interest In SHIB The Shiba Inu ecosystem recently witnessed a notable development as the number of new addresses on the SHIB network reached 2,538 on May 26, according to Glassnode. This figure represents the highest influx of new participants or investors into the SHIB ecosystem since February. Such a surge in new addresses indicates a growing interest in the SHIB token and potentially impacts the market dynamics. Furthermore, it serves as evidence of increased demand for the token within the crypto community. Source: Glassnode Long-Term Shiba Inu Holders Face Challenges While the entry of new participants is a positive sign for the SHIB ecosystem, the same cannot be said for long-term holders of the token. IntoTheBlock data reveals that approximately 78% of SHIB holders currently find themselves in a position of loss. Source: IntoTheBlock This indicates that the majority of long-term SHIB holders have seen a decline in the value of their investments, which can be disheartening for those who have been holding onto the token for an extended period. Source: Coingecko At present, the price of SHIB stands at $0.00000877, as per CoinGecko. However, recent market movements have caused some fluctuations in its value. Over a span of 24 hours, SHIB experienced a subtle decline of 0.8%, followed by a week-long decline of 3.0%. SHIB total market cap at $5.07 billion on the daily chart at TradingView.com Long-Term Value In The Meme Coin The current surge in new addresses and sustained interest from Ethereum whales in SHIB reflects a contrasting narrative to its abysmal performance over the past year and in the preceding months. Despite this historical underperformance, insights from a crypto market analysis platform revealed that a staggering 80% of SHIB holders possess significant amounts of tokens in their portfolios. Additionally, data from WhaleStats demonstrated that SHIB remained the most frequently traded token by Ethereum whales within the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Floki Inu: Does Meme Coin Have What It Takes To Re-Enter Top 100 Spot? These findings suggest that despite SHIB’s lackluster performance, there remains considerable interest and confidence among influential market players, such as Ethereum whales. This sustained interest from these cohorts implies that they view SHIB as a potentially valuable asset to hold in the long term. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice.

42410551,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdfW1Y,1685448177,India's RBI Intends to Push G-20 to Focus on Crypto's Macro Risks,"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is trying to expand the global narrative around cryptocurrencies beyond ""financial stability and integrity to macro-financial and cross-sectoral implications and risks of crypto-assets,"" the central bank said in its annual report published on Tuesday.  The move is seen as a step to attract attention towards how crypto can hurt or completely change the global economy rather than just nations and customers individually, government sources have told CoinDesk previously. However, this is perhaps the first time the RBI has articulated its ""intent"" as an important stakeholder in the current global conversation around global crypto rules, even as it reiterated its concerns saying ""cryptocurrencies are a material threat to financial stability.""  India currently holds the presidency of the Group of 20 (G-20) nations, giving it the power to set the agenda. The RBI helps the Finance Ministry in shaping the agenda.  At the start of the nation's presidency, Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said how to regulate crypto assets should be an international priority and will be a big topic of discussion during its G-20 presidency.  In February, India announced that coming global crypto rules will be based on what's in a new synthesis paper jointly produced by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The FSB sets international standards around global financial stability and is expected to publish its individual recommendations for regulating crypto and stablecoins in July 2023.  ""The intent of India’s Presidency is to expand the G-20 crypto asset narrative beyond financial stability and financial integrity concerns to capture the macro-financial and cross-sectoral implications and risks of crypto assets,"" the RBI annual report said. The report also revealed the central bank is prioritizing the discussion on CBDCs ""with a focus on their macro-financial implications.""  India's ongoing retail and wholesale CBDC pilots will be expanded by ""incorporating various use cases and features"" to more than the current 15 cities and 13 banks, the report said. The retail CBDC pilot began in Dec. 2022 and by April it had onboarded more than 100,000 customers, with the ambition to take that number to a million by July, CoinDesk has reported.

13031192,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=535651,1685448018,XRP Bullish Signal: Address Activity Spikes To Historical Levels,"On-chain data shows the XRP active addresses metric has spiked to historical levels recently, a sign that may turn out to be bullish for the asset. XRP Daily Active Addresses Has Observed An Uplift Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, address activity on the network reached its second and third-highest values ever during the last couple of days. The “active addresses” indicator tracks the total number of unique addresses that are participating in some kind of transaction activity on the XRP blockchain daily. This metric accounts for both senders and receivers. As the indicator only measures the unique number of addresses, it means that even if there are some addresses making multiple transfers on the network in a single day, their contribution toward the metric remains only one unit. Unique addresses can be thought to be the same as the unique users visiting the blockchain, so the active addresses indicator can tell us about the degree of traffic that the network is observing at the moment. When the value of this metric is high, it means that a large number of addresses are taking part in transfers on the chain right now. Such a trend suggests that traders are active in the market currently. Related Reading: Bitcoin Shows Recovery: Did This Historical Line Act As Support Again? On the other hand, low values imply the network isn’t observing that much activity right now. This kind of trend can sometimes be a sign that there isn’t much interest in the cryptocurrency among general investors. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin daily active addresses over the last few months: Looks like the value of the metric has been quite high in recent days | Source: Santiment on Twitter As shown in the above graph, the XRP active addresses had been at relatively low values during the past few weeks, but in the last couple of days, the indicator has suddenly burst into life. Around two days ago, the metric saw its second-highest-ever daily spike, registering a value of around 490,000. This means that 490,000 unique addresses had been interacting on the chain during this surge. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Hopes Still Alive, If This Metric Is To Go By Yesterday, the metric observed a slowdown and has since dropped down to a value of 281,000. This level, however, is still the third largest in the history of the cryptocurrency, meaning that activity still continues to be at historically high levels right now. The only instance where a higher value than these spikes was observed (that is, the all-time high of the indicator) was back on the 18th of March. In the chart, Santiment has highlighted this particular surge. Interestingly, the price of XRP went on to rally around 45% following the occurrence of this spike, suggesting that the high user activity may have provided the fuel for the rise. Currently, as users continue to remain highly active on the network, the price is also going up. It’s unclear, though, whether this ongoing surge will grow into anything like what was seen earlier in the year, but it’s an optimistic sign nonetheless.

Data from TradingView show RNDR has gained 6.5% to $2.55, with prices hitting a 13-month high of $2.93 early this month. Wall Street's tech-heavy index Nasdaq has gained nearly 8%. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC) has declined by 5%, decoupling from Nasdaq and the total market value of all cryptocurrencies has dropped by 3.5%.  ""RNDR has been a good high beta Nasdaq play in recent weeks,"" Decentral Park Capital's portfolio manager Lewis Harland said in Friday's market update, noting the artificial intelligence narrative as a catalyst for gains in both tech stocks and RNDR.  A week ago, the U.S.-based chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), while forecasting surging revenue, said it is increasing supply to meet the spike in demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) chips used to power ChatGPT and similar services.  Since then, investors have been scrambling to take exposure to shares in Nvidia and other assets like Render's RNDR token that align with the AI narrative.  ""RNDR (Render Network) stands out due to its unique convergence of key narratives such as integrations with the Apple ecosystem, Metaverse involvement, artificial intelligence (AI) integration, and 3D rendering capabilities,"" crypto fundamental analyst Jason Choi said in his research newsletter Blockcrunch VIP dated May 22.  ""As demand for GPU computing power is expected to soar in fields like gaming, metaverse development, architecture, animation, product design, augmented reality (AR), and more recently, AI tooling, RNDR may present an accessible alternative to expensive computing equipment typically required for creating 3D graphics,"" Choi added.

The platform’s recent announcement comes in the midst of a countdown to a significant payment deadline, adding a sense of urgency to the offer. While Bitcoin (BTC) currently trades above $27,000 on several exchanges, it traded at a price of AUD34,863 on (USD22,670) Binance Australia lower than its current price on exchanges. The limited period that comes with the discount has made some traders act fast so as to take advantage of the reduced price. Bitcoin Trading At A Discount Recent market data has revealed an intriguing trend on Binance Australia, with Bitcoin and other digital tokens trading at a discount compared to rival exchanges within the country. Related Reading: No All-Time High For Bitcoin In 2023, Former BitMEX Head Arthur Hayes Predicts CryptoCompare data shows that Bitcoin traded at A$34,863 ($22,670) on Binance Australia, significantly lower than the average price on platforms like Independent Reserve and CoinJar. Notably, discounts of around 20% were also observed for popular tokens such as Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). The discount on Binance Australia is closely linked to impending changes in the platform’s payment withdrawal options. Starting from 5 p.m. on June 1, users will no longer be able to withdraw Australian dollars to their bank accounts using the popular PayID service. This follows the platform’s earlier loss of access to certain Aussie dollar deposit services, creating a series of challenges for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Industry experts have weighed in on the situation, shedding light on the motivations behind the discounted Bitcoin prices. Richard Galvin, the co-founder of fund manager Digital Asset Capital Management, explains that Australian clients are selling Bitcoin at a discount to ensure they can withdraw their Australian dollars before the payment deadline. This urgency has created a unique opportunity for investors looking to acquire Bitcoin at a reduced price. Furthermore, to ease the withdrawal process for users, Binance Australia has devised a solution. Following the payment deadline, Australian dollar balances can be converted into the Tether stablecoin, facilitating both withdrawals and trading activities. The platform is actively seeking alternative providers to restore AUD deposit and withdrawal services, underscoring its commitment to offering a seamless user experience. BTC Latest Price Action Meanwhile, Bitcoin hasn’t shown any significant move in the past week. Instead, the largest crypto asset by market capitalization has recorded sluggish movement up by only 1.7% in the past 7 days. Over the past 24 hours, BTC has seen a 0.1% loss. At the time of writing, Bitcoin currently trades at $27,849 after trading slightly above $28,000 on Sunday. Bitcoin’s trading volume has plunged a bit from $14 billion earlier last week to $12 billion in the past 24 hours indicating less trading activity.

The ECB says its potential central bank digital currency (CBDC) can be designed to boost innovation – but appears more skeptical about using Web3-style distributed ledger technology and smart contracts.  “This exercise shows that it is possible to smoothly integrate the digital euro design choices into the existing payment landscape while leaving ample scope for innovative features and technologies,” ECB Executive Board member Fabio Panetta said in a letter to the European Parliament’s Irene Tinagli, adding that findings “will serve as input for both the functional and technical design of a digital euro.”  While the digital euro was at one stage floated as an answer to Facebook’s own currency, Libra – subsequently renamed diem and then abandoned – the ECB’s prototypes have been plagued by controversy due to the involvement of another U.S. tech giant, Amazon.  As EU lawmakers called for a U-turn on the plans, Panetta appeared keen to downplay the long-term significance of Amazon’s involvement, saying that prototypes were a “lab experiment” to be “discarded and not used further.”  Design  For the back-end of the prototype – developed by the central bank itself – the ECB rejected distributed ledger technology, but favored a centralized model based on unspent transaction outputs, or UTXO, that are also used in crypto transactions.  The UTXO system “allows for fast and efficient validation of transactions,” supporting different payment types while protecting privacy, the ECB report said, adding that it also allowed conditional payments to be made without using smart contracts – a type of automated software popular in decentralized finance.  In June, the European Commission is due to publish a bill covering digital euro privacy safeguards and other major issues. But lawmakers have expressed skepticism over the CBDC’s benefits, particularly if it doesn’t allow for innovations such as programmable money where users can control how funds are subsequently used.  The EU is one of many jurisdictions across the world currently contemplating a CBDC – including near neighbors at the Bank of England.

Like the earlier version of the protocol, New Qredo, announced on Tuesday, uses clever key sharding tech called multi-party computation (MPC), with improved control over team permissions and approval processes, the company said in a press release.  Having complete control over digital assets is ever more vital in the wake of last year’s blows-up of FTX and the bankruptcies of various other centralized crypto platforms. As such, there’s a gap in the market for a custody system that’s open-source, on-chain and doesn’t cost the earth, according to Qredo chief operating officer Josh Goodbody.  “The New Qredo is a brand new institutional-grade custody and wallet management platform, and the radical thing we’ve done is make it open and available to anyone,” Goodbody said in an interview with CoinDesk. “The big players in this space like Copper, Fireblocks and others gate-keep their product and charge a very high service fee that means really only large firms are able to use them.”  Qredo has been building custody and wallet products for over four years now, with over 85,000 users globally, of which 350 are institutional and corporate clients, Goodbody said. The firm sees an average of over $4 billion of monthly asset movements in and out of wallets.  “We saw a spike to just under $6 billion per month following the collapse of FTX, when everybody flooded to self custody,” Goodbody said. “Over the course of last year alone, the flight to self custody saw us secure just under $30 billion of crypto asset movements.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/30/crypto-storage-firm-qredos-revamped-self-custody-wallet-goes-live,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0ee3519a49b6ffa246f83dcb8a238df8ff57433d-5520x3376.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410545,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdfVrd,1685434413,"U.S. Criminal Charges Against Sam Bankman-Fried Don’t Warrant Dismissal, Prosecutors Say","Criminal charges that lawyers for Sam Bankman-Fried sought to dismiss, including technicalities around his extradition back to the U.S. and campaign finance violations, are valid, prosecutors said in court filings from Monday.  In early May, Bankman-Fried filed pretrial motions to dismiss most charges levied against him by U.S. prosecutors, with his defense arguing procedural issues, the irrelevance of some U.S. laws given FTX's non-U.S. location, and that the charges exceeded the agreed extradition terms. The motions did not seek to dismiss securities fraud and money laundering charges.  With regards to Bankman-Fried’s argument that the Bahamas needs to approve any charges prior to extradition, prosecutors contended that the extradition treaty with the Caribbean nation allows for post-extradition charges with the consent of the extraditing country, and any charges presented post-extradition in new indictments do not violate this rule.  One of these charges, filed in March, alleged that the former executive had violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) because he offered $40 million to unnamed Chinese officials to convince them to unfreeze accounts.  While Bankman-Fried argued allegations he had committed commodity fraud are invalid because it involves extraterritorial enforcement, U.S. prosecutors said the accusations should stand as the impact of FTX’s trades were felt in crypto markets within the U.S.  On the allegations of campaign finance law violation – which center around Bankman-Fried donating money in the names of FTX executives – prosecutors said his arguments don't hold up because the indictment details exactly how he worked to obscure the source of funds for donations.  The filing also notes that the defense has requested more discovery documents, arguing that the FTX estate ""should be considered part of the 'prosecution team'"" due to its cooperation with the U.S. Department of Justice.  Bankman-Fried is due in a New York court in October.

13026997,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=535634,1685434410,Pepecoin Eyes Rebound As It Finds Support In Strong Algorithm Data Score,"Pepecoin (PEPE) has recently experienced a significant development as it hits a crucial bullish order block (OB), raising hopes for a potential recovery opportunity. However, the ability to reverse the prevailing downtrend momentum is contingent upon an essential factor that holds the key to the coin’s future trajectory. In a market characterized by uncertainty, investors and enthusiasts eagerly await the resolution of this pivotal element to determine whether Pepecoin can regain its lost momentum and chart a new course. Related Reading: Floki Inu: Does Meme Coin Have What It Takes To Re-Enter Top 100 Spot? Evaluating Pepecoin Price Potential For A Reversal Since May 24, Pepecoin (PEPE) has exhibited a positive response to the bullish OB. This encouraging price action implies a significant influx of buyers at this level, indicating that the bullish OB could serve as a crucial demand zone capable of triggering a potential price U-turn, especially if Bitcoin makes it past the key $28,000 region. Nevertheless, PEPE’s price movement currently faces constraints from both ends. On one side, there is the trendline resistance, while on the other side, the bullish OB acts as a limiting factor. Crypto total market cap unchanged at $1.12 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com Should the bullish sentiment persist and bulls manage to overcome the resistance posed by the trendline, PEPE could endeavor to rally towards the 50% Fibonacci level, which stands at $0.00000160. PEPE currently finds itself in the grips of a challenging market environment, with its CoinGecko price at a meager $0.00000136. The past 24 hours have witnessed a slight slump of 6.5%, further exacerbating the coin’s struggles, while the seven-day period has seen a significant decline of 13.6%. Source: Coingecko Understanding PEPE’s Volatility And Intrinsic Value Pepecoin (PEPE) has consistently exhibited an incredibly volatile movement, a characteristic that is not entirely unexpected. As a cryptocurrency, PEPE falls within the broader category known for its highly volatile nature. However, PEPE’s status as a meme coin adds an additional layer of complexity to its price fluctuations, as it lacks intrinsic value. In the early stages, PEPE experienced a continuous upward price movement, drawing attention and interest from investors seeking quick gains. However, experts in the field have long predicted that, eventually, PEPE’s price would spiral downwards. Regrettably, the current situation seems to align with these projections. Impressive DEXT Score For Pepecoin Meanwhile, Pepecoin enjoys an impressive DEXT Score of 99/99 and high liquidity, which is a positive sign for the meme coin. DEXTools’ DEXT Score is an algorithm that takes into account data from the blockchain as well as other sources to determine the reliability of a given project. The higher the score, the better for the crypto. Social data, pair liquidity, transaction volume, token circulation, and contract creation are just some of the metrics that make up the DEXT Score. Source: DEXTools Meme coins, like PEPE, often rely heavily on social media trends, community enthusiasm, and speculative trading. Without a solid foundation of intrinsic value or underlying assets, their prices are particularly vulnerable to sudden shifts in sentiment and market dynamics. As a result, investors must approach meme coins like PEPE with caution and a thorough understanding of the inherent risks involved. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice.

42410549,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdfWBT,1685433622,Bitcoin Headed for First Monthly Loss in 6 Months,"Bitcoin (BTC) has regained some poise since last Thursday, but the cryptocurrency still appears on track for its first monthly loss since December.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value traded near $27,800 at press time, a 7.5% rise from lows under $25,900 registered last week. However, prices were still down about 5% for the month, the first monthly decline of the year (assuming, this loss is held through Wednesday's UTC close). Bitcoin has put in a positive performance in January, March and April and ended February on a flat note.  Against ether (ETH), bitcoin looked set for a monthly decline of nearly 7%, CoinDesk data show.  Bitcoin's dour monthly performance comes as bond traders have reinstated bets that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will keep interest rates elevated for longer in response to sticky inflation and a resilient labor market. Earlier, interest rate traders expected the Fed funds rate, the benchmark borrowing cost, to fall to 4.5% or lower by the end of 2023 from the current 5%. However, the market no longer foresees the Fed implementing rate cuts this year.  The renewed hawkish Fed bets have given a boost to the U.S. dollar this month, lifting the greenback by 2.7% against a basket of fiat currencies, including the euro. Bitcoin tends to move in the opposite direction of the dollar.  Capital has been leaving the crypto market since early last year. The trend has persevered this month, with the stablecoin market capitalization shrinking to a 20-month low of $130 billion. Stablecoins are digital assets with values pegged to an external reference like the U.S. dollar and have been widely used to fund purchases of other cryptocurrencies over the past three years.  ""We can assume that the liquidity wave of lower inflation has now run its course and the market needs a new driver and theme to lift prices higher,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto services provider Matrixport, said. ""The tech sector tends to be correlated with BTC, but the former has found new life with the AI and Chat GPT revolution, which is not benefiting BTC yet.""  Bitcoin has decoupled from Wall Street's technology-heavy index Nasdaq, which has risen nearly 8% this month.  Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin, said the continued high-interest rate environment would keep the odds against bitcoin bulls.  ""In a high-interest rate environment, high risk-free returns such as money market funds are more attractive to investors, which means the lack of liquidity in the crypto market continues,"" Ardern said.  Dick Lo, the founder and CEO of quant-driven crypto trading firm TDX, said, bitcoin's 4% rise on Sunday was a relief rally triggered by U.S. leaders announcing a provision deal to lift the $31.4 trillion debt limit hit in January and further gains may be hard to come by.  ""The rebound we saw on Sunday night / Monday morning was very much a relief rally on the back of the U.S. debt ceiling package. The market will likely return its focus to the possibility of another 25 basis points interest rate hike at the June FOMC meeting and the potential liquidity drain as the Treasury needs to sell at least $500 billion in bills in the short-term to refill its cash position, which will weigh on risk assets,"" Lo said.  We see strong resistance on BTC at $28,500 with initial support seen at $27,350, followed by a potential retest of $26,200,"" Lo added.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/30/bitcoin-headed-for-first-monthly-loss-since-december,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f1f8596fa071343113f777e7d7dc3988dd0792c0-720x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

ETH is currently supported and might soon aim for a move toward $2,000. Ethereum is currently eyeing a fresh increase above the $1,920 resistance zone. The price is trading above $1,880 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a major bullish trend line forming with support near $1,880 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $1,920 resistance. Ethereum Price Remains Supported Ethereum’s price started a decent increase above the $1,800 resistance. ETH even broke the $1,880 level before the bears appeared near $1,920 and pushed the price lower, similar to Bitcoin. There was a downside correction below the $1,900 and $1,885 levels.

If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,920 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,885 level. The next major support is near the $1,870 zone or the trend line. If there is a close below the $1,870 support, the price could decline toward the 100 hourly SMA.

Bitcoin is beginning East Asia’s trading day down 1.3% at $27,746 while ether is down 1.1% to $1,893.  In the last few weeks, crypto has struggled with a narrative problem. The absence of a defining narrative – is it a risk asset, or a hedge against risk? – has made for patternless price swings and confused investors.  Some might say, for instance, that bitcoin should have risen on debt ceiling uncertainty, as a U.S. default would have jolted the traditional financial system. But instead, bitcoin acted like a stock. Perhaps crypto’s narrative is no narrative at all.  Ed Moya, a Senior Market Analyst with foreign exchange market maker OANDA, posits that the upcoming U.S. election is the narrative to watch.  “We were reminded that the key to Bitcoin’s success in the US might depend on the upcoming presidential election,"" Moya wrote in a note Friday. ""Florida governor Ron Desantis announced his intentions to run for president and appears poised to ‘protect’ Bitcoin.”  With Central Bank Digital Currencies being a new wedge issue in Florida’s political landscape, the national stage is the next logical step. Crypto has come up in elections worldwide, such as South Korea and Thailand, and President Joe Biden mentioned it when discussing debt deal negotiations.  Maybe this will be the narrative to watch?

The 24-contract increase follows a reduction of 162 contracts the week prior.  The increase halts what appeared to be more of an overall reduction in exposure than a commentary on price itself. Asset managers reduced their short positions as well over the identical time period by a total of 194 contracts.
