42376448,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6Adrv,1367861200,CarbonWallet offers beefy security for storing bitcoins,"CarbonWallet  , a new bitcoin wallet service, is offering a new model for securely storing the digital currency.  Described as an ""online deterministic wallet"", CarbonWallet doesn't store bitcoins locally or on its servers. Instead, users create a passphrase that is turned into a 128-bit key, which is then used to generate bitcoin addresses.  ""Your passphrase is your wallet access and wallet backup,"" the CarbonWallet site states. ""Determined bitcoin addresses mean no need for a remote server to hold keys and no need to store keys on a local hard drive.""  However - the approach also means users must ensure they don't forget or lose their passphrases.  ""Without the passphrase your coins are gone,"" CarbonWallet warns. ""There is no way to retrieve CarbonWallet wallets without the passphrase.""  The site recommends that users write down their passphrases and keep them stored someplace secure. It also warns that users need to be alert to potential attempts to steal their passphrases via phishing, social engineering, malware or brute force.  ""According to ""how big is your haystack?"" (o)ur passphrases would take five-hundred trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion centuries to break under a massive cracking scenario,"" the site states.  CarbonWallet's passphrases are compatible with both the Electrum bitcoin client and Brainwallet.org. That means users can take their passphrases to either of those wallets if CarbonWallet's servers go down, ensuring they can still access their bitcoins.  More details on how CarbonWallet works can be found at its page on the code-sharing site GitHub.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | TECHNOLOGY,Shirley Siluk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/06/carbonwallet-offers-beefy-security-for-storing-bitcoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/52d1d0be88d6c6c1c0cdf97bfe75a3da3e9fefc2-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376458,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6Ae1z,1367852465,Are Amazon Coins designed for breakage?,"Your cash has never been more valuable  Amazon is set to launch its Amazon Coin this month. It’s an interesting move and one that paves the way for other retailers to soak up a lot of cash with very little effort.  There’s nothing new about companies offering gift tokens, but this is currency -- and word has it that several other large brands are developing their own versions to be wrapped in their own corporate identities.  As a customer, you’d be offered cheaper goods for using their currency. For example, with Amazon Coins, you might pay less for a product than if you paid with cash.  So why do companies want to do it?  Well, it’s the simple reason that companies want your cash. In an economy where nothing is certain any longer, cash is king. Cash flow, however -- as any business owner will attest –- is even more valuable.  As a company, having your own corporate currency solves three big problems around cash flow:  1 – No transaction fees  If I’m a retailer taking a lot of payments, I will be spending millions -- if not billions -- of dollars on transactions fees.  Companies find this irritating. Large retailers already spend millions trying to find the cheapest transaction price to use in real time.  The entire transactions infrastructure is built on lots of organizations taking a small cut for moving money around quickly. It’s bogged down with regulation that, for a global company, is oh so very dull.  2 – Fraudulent payments  Big retail companies  have to foot the bill for a lot of fraud. They are victims of fraud because they can’t tell the difference between a legitimate and a dodgy transaction.  By owning a digital currency, companies like Amazon could tighten the controls over the transactions they will accept. And if fraud occurs, they don’t lose cash –- they lose their monkey tokens.  3 – They can use your cash  This is the big one –- and it’s called “breakage”. This is a term used in accounting at gift card companies when people buy tokens or vouchers and never use them. This is profitable for a company, which relies on the fact a certain percentage of people will never reclaim their money. Accountants have been confused as to how they should account for the money.  Last month, one of the most widely used versions of digital currency –- the Oyster Card –- was accused of hoarding £53m in unclaimed ticket money. Those people who had tried to reclaim their cash found it took a long time to do so and had to go through a very hard process.  Having a pot of £53m of other people’s money is quite convenient for a large business. They know people won’t ask for it back all at once or -- if they do -- the company can take its time in giving it back.  Guarding or lending the cash stash?  So ... companies that are ""watching over"" big pots of cash can use the money for other things, like lending. Now banks would normally pay you interest for the convenience of using your cash to lend to other people. Breakage doesn’t go there. Nor will you know where your money is being lent (though, to be fair, you wouldn't with a bank either).  Utility companies are notorious for taking direct debit payments larger than the bill you owe. What happens to that money while it’s in their care? You’d have to ask them. But lending is a very attractive option for companies with cash they have access to.  Is breakage fair for the consumer?  It depends how quickly you believe people should give your money back. If it's quickly, the answer is ""no"".  But it's not illegal.  Could it be more transparent? Yes.  Could it be easier to see how much money you have in your accounts? Yes. (There might be an app opportunity in that.)  Is it profitable for the company? Yes.  Could it be better regulated? Probably.  Open vs closed  Consumers are much wiser to the benefits and drawbacks of technology these days. No one wants inconvenience. So Amazon and friends will have to be vigilant over how useful it is to people in their general shopping ... not just on Amazon.  The latter assumes (as many technology companies have wrongly assumed before) that the company will be the dominant player in their market whatever the weather. As we have seen, that mindset quickly becomes expensive when there’s a more convenient technology around the corner ...  In this case, there is a tightrope to walk in launching currency for convenience: Too locked down –- people will not like it and something else will come along. Too open –- there’s a whole world of trouble around rates, inflation and acceptance, so companies would need an infrastructure (and philosophy) to cope with that.  Don’t disregard cash –- liquidity counts  Make no mistake: cash is valuable. It will be around for a long time yet. Why would you ditch a system that works? Companies have realized -- as banks did a long time ago -- that whoever controls liquidity is in a good position.  Companies are keen to use your cash. Why? Because it’s more valuable to them than ever.",NEUTRAL,없음,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Dan Ilett,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/06/are-amazon-coins-designed-for-breakage,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c916db3b50998535ac7a97824841395a9d801ec3-628x356.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376443,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6Adld,1367825200,A night at a London Bitcoin Meetup,"Robin Dhara connects people. He meets a lot of people on his travels. But he hadn't met any bitcoin people ... so we sent him to a London Bitcoin Meetup to see what he could learn.  I have to admit I’m late in coming to the bitcoin party. It’s a new topic for me. I wasn’t quite sure what to expect of a meeting at the back of a tourist pub in Paddington last week.  When I arrived, I couldn’t see anyone who looked ""bitcoiny"" or part of a new tech revolution. But there was a clearing at the back of the room, where a crowd had gathered, taking it in turns to speak around a pool table.  This was it ...  Keeping good company  What immediately surprised me was the quality of people in the room. In the crowd were some of London’s most prominent tech personalities and developers.  I learned very quickly that the UK is turning into a hive of startups exploring the bitcoin economy. Incubators, bitcoin miners and development companies are springing up all over the UK designing new ways the currency can be used ... not just in the digital world, but in the physical world too.  One developer, who asked not to be named, has started a campaign to list the retailers willing to accept bitcoin as currency. He wants to turn the data into an app for consumers.  I also learned there have been similar talks of shopkeepers in Germany accepting bitcoins instead of euros. However, gaining the trust of more traditional retailers will need more work. There would need to be physical locations where bitcoins could be cashed out for more people to buy into it, one man tells me. After all, people need to know how to get at their money.  I did hear of a Bureau De Change group that is currently looking into accepting bitcoins in London. More on that one next time ...  Digital currency in action  An interesting answer came from Pablo, a filmmaker and activist from Barcelona. In an experiment that reminded me of the Brixton Pound, he talked of a local currency used in the outskirts of Barcelona called the Eco.  The Eco is largely used and managed by a community that operates as an ""integral co-operative"" for families, health and housing services ... without the need to deal with the relevant state departments directly.  This solved the problem of trying to secure papers and documents, which some in the community might not have readily available. Already being used by several thousand people, the managers of the Eco are exploring cryptocurrencies and seeing positive results so far.  And so it seems there are three kinds of people who are interested in bitcoin: Those who want to make money. Those interested in programming and security. And the idealists who want to build communities for the greater good.  That’s what struck me about this Bitcoin London Meetup: the bitcoin movement seems to be an example of democracy at work.  The other side of the coin  Despite the energy in the room, there was also a certain nervousness. Some people believed that the bitcoin would be ""banned by big money"".  This is not an idle concern. Mirroring the entertainment industry, which tried to stop pirating and sharing music, bitcoin’s problems could potentially be far bigger. Bitcoin is on a collision course with banking.  “The thing that will save bitcoin is international expansion,” said Javier, CEO of a global bitcoin trading company. “You also have to consider that most of the people that have power today in the world are over 50.  “Most of the people that have made it will not go down without a fight and they don't want to know about bitcoin. They don't understand the technology, it’s too complicated.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Robin Dhara,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/06/a-night-at-a-london-bitcoin-meetup,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e99e59161a273836bbb4e8ad17c7557c26930a29-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
