42401707,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2Dol,1532985021,Gallup Poll: 75% of US Investors Think Bitcoin Is 'Very Risky',"Three-quarters of U.S. investors with more than $10,000 in stocks, bonds and mutual funds think bitcoin is a ""very risky"" investment, a new survey revealed Monday.  A poll conducted by Gallup and Wells Fargo asked U.S.-based investors about their views on bitcoin, finding that just 2 percent currently own any and more than 70 percent ""have no interest in ever buying bitcoin."" A further 26 percent are ""intrigued"" but do not plan to purchase any in the near future, the poll found.  The poll surveyed nearly 2,000 adults in the U.S. who have invested either in a retirement savings account or through another type of account, according to Gallup. It was conducted over the course of a week in early May.  The survey found that bitcoin's perceived riskiness is the primary reason few investors are holding the cryptocurrency. While 75 percent considered bitcoin to be ""very risky,"" less than 0.5 percent (or less than 10 people surveyed) thought bitcoin was ""not risky at all."" Only 2 percent thought bitcoin was ""not too risky,"" with the remaining 23 percent thinking of bitcoin as being at least ""somewhat risky.""  Another reason for the lack of interest might come from bitcoin's limited popularity as only 29 percent of investors surveyed in the poll say they knew anything about cryptocurrencies.  In addition, the statistics show that the perception of bitcoin varies among investors in different age and gender.  ""Men and younger investors are far more likely than women and seniors to say they know something about bitcoin or other digital currencies,"" the pollsters wrote.  Just 3 percent of men and 1 percent of women said they owned bitcoin, with 3 percent of those aged 18 to 49 and 1 percent aged 50 or older.  ""For now, most investors are on the sidelines, knowing little to nothing about bitcoin,"" the pollsters concluded. ""Few are already invested in it, and even fewer plan to jump in soon.""

The cryptocurrency merchant bank, which was first announced in January, received final approval from Canadian regulators to begin trading, founder and billionaire investor Michael Novogratz told BNN Bloomberg Toronto. He called the process to receive permission ""frustrating,"" citing the time it took to receive this approval.  He added:  ""If I knew what I know now, knew the crypto markets were going to swoon as much, and it was going to take so long, I might have stayed private for another year or so and then gone public. But I don't think it's a mistake.""  Galaxy Digital lost $134 million in the first quarter of 2018, largely due to declining cryptocurrency prices, the company announced in a quarterly earnings report last week, as CoinDesk previously reported.  The lengthy listing time came from the fact that Galaxy Digital chose to undergo a reverse takeover by merging with a TSX-listed shell company. Regulators examined the deal closely, going so far as to push back the final approval for listing from April to August, according to Bloomberg.  That being said, Novogratz believes cryptocurrency prices will rebound, predicting that bitcoin's price might soon see $10,000 again.  ""I think we actually [are] in the bottom of the market. Part of this is the anticipation of an ETF that will hopefully get approved. If that ETF gets approved in a few weeks, we will go to $10,000. I don't think we get through $10,000 cause there is a big ceiling over there,"" he said.  Investors need more tools to trust the space before the price can go beyond $10,000, he said, explaining that ""a lot of retailer investors got caught by bad prices last November and December.""  ""I don't think we will get through $10,000 until we get custody solutions announced implemented by trusted names,"" he added.  At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around the $8,000 mark, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.

Le Minh Tam, head of Vietnam-based Sky Mining, has been missing since July 26, according to the report. The startup, which claimed it would rent crypto miners to investors for between $100 and $5,000, received funds from roughly 5,000 individuals prior to Tam's disappearance last week. Each miner would promise a 300 percent return over a year, with investors keeping the machines for at least 15 and up to as many as 18 months.  However, when one group of investors went to pick up their miners last Friday, they found that the firm's mining facility and office were empty, and that the mining machines had already been taken away. Tam later reportedly claimed he sold them to cover financial losses, and that his disappearance was aimed at protecting his life.  He sent a similar message on Sunday, claiming that he would return, but Sky Mining deputy chairman Le Minh Hieu claimed the CEO had stolen the funds and relocated to the U.S.  Some investors have already filed lawsuits against the firm, though it is unclear if they will receive their funds back.  Vietnamese news outlet VnExpress reported that Tam controlled every aspect of the company, overseeing all mining operations and controlling all the funds.  Hieu said he tried to set up a temporary board to run the company in Tam's absence, but death threats against him and his family forced him to shut it down.

42401712,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2Dqj,1532955643,Dubai Plans to 'Disrupt' Its Own Legal System with Blockchain,"A Dubai-based international court dealing with civil and commercial disputes in the financial industry is planning to launch what it calls a ""Court of the Blockchain"" to streamline legal operations.  The Dubai International Financial Center (DIFC) Courts announced on Monday that it is teaming up with the government-backed Smart Dubai initiative to form a task force that will focus on developing the blockchain-based legal platform.  The DIFC said the goal is to employ a network based on blockchain and smart contracts to allow different courts to share information in a decentralized manner. With the system, it said, the need to carry out manual tasks such as document duplication will be eliminated, bringing a higher level of efficiency to the current system.  As an initial step, the two partners said the task force will focus on an R&D effort to put court judgement data on a blockchain so institutions can verify and share information in real-time for better cross-border law enforcement.  ""Future research will combine expertise and resources to investigate handling disputes arising out of private and public blockchains, with regulation and contractual terms encoded within the smart contract,"" according the the release.  The effort comes as part of the Dubai's wider push to bring smart innovations to its government operations.  The Smart Dubai Office's director general, Dr Aisha Bint Butti Bin Bishr, explained in today's announcement that Dubai's blockchain strategy ""seeks to run 100 percent of applicable government transactions on blockchain by 2020.""  The director general added:  ""An invention of this calibre and potential requires an equally disruptive set of rules and an empowered institution to uphold them. This is where our partnership with DIFC Courts comes in, allowing us to work together and create the world's first disruptive court, helping to truly unlock the power of blockchain technology.""  As part of the 2020 project, various government bodies have already announced individual blockchain initiatives.  For instance, in May, the Department of Economic Development announced its plan to develop a commercial business registry platform using blockchain tech. And, last year, the Dubai Immigration and Visas Department also said it was working on blockchain-based passports that could potentially eliminate manual checks at the U.A.E. city's international airport.

42429420,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLyjDh,1532952015,Draper Dragon Backs $20 Million Raise for Alibaba Vets' Blockchain Startup,"A public blockchain project founded by the former head of Alibaba's blockchain team has raised over $20 million from institutional investors in a combined token and equity sale.  Called Ultrain, the startup announced Monday that leading investors in the round included token funds, such as Draper Dragon, FBG Capital, DanHua VC and Arrington XRP Capital, as well as blockchain industry startups, such as crypto wallet Bixin and exchange OKCoin. Traditional VC funds including Morningside Capital and Ceyuan Capital also participated.  Launched in October 2017, Ultrain was created by a group of former Alibaba staffers. The project's chief executive, Ray Guo, was in charge of security strategy and data security as the former tech director of the Alibaba Group's security unit.  Additionally, its chief technology officer, William Li, previously led the blockchain development team of Alibaba payment affiliate Ant Financial and was a core architect at AliCloud. Meanwhile, Emma Liao, another co-founder and also the chief strategy officer, is the former head of internet of things investment at Qihoo 360, an internet giant focused on security.  With the new funding, the company said it will focus on the technological development of its public blockchain protocol – also called Ultrain – that is designed as a scalable platform for empowering decentralized applications (dapps)  Earlier this year, the platform launched a test version of its network that was claimed to be able to process 3,000 transactions per second (TPS) on a network with 1,000 nodes hosted on Alibaba cloud servers.  Guo told CoinDesk that public blockchain projects should focus on the ""real needs of users"" instead of focusing solely on TPS, adding that 3,000 TPS would be plenty for the time being.  He said:  ""Alipay has 150 million daily active users, its peak TPS on normal days is around 4,000 to 5,000. The next step for dapps is breaking 1 million daily active users. Therefore a public blockchain with 3,000 TPS will be enough for dapps for at least two years.""  While being a prolific prep-school for blockchain entrepreneurs with over 65 blockchain-related patents so far, pushing forward blockchain applications at Alibaba is not as easy as it might seem, according to the team.  Explaining why he'd made the decision to leave and start his own project, Guo told CoinDesk that Alibaba's strategy is to ""build an ecosystem around itself.""  ""A vital part of this strategy is strong control over the partners within the ecosystem – it is a centralized way of thinking. It is very hard to change the minds of the internal business leaders and persuade them to negotiate with the partners instead of controlling them,"" he said.  Li also spoke to the greater possibilities to be had when founding an independent project, saying:  ""Currently, the country's policy towards entrepreneurs is relatively friendly, so our blockchain exploration can cover every aspect of the technology, including a public blockchain focusing on a token eco-system. ... On the contrary, all I could do at Ant Financial was a token-less consortium blockchain.""

42429431,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLyjZh,1532948418,A Blueprint for Reforming the Crypto Token Market,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      The token industry needs to grow up.  I'm not talking about financial growth, at least not for now. With $20 billion raised in ""initial coin offerings"" and an overall token market valuation of $300 billion, early participants in crypto finance have done a spectacular job of ""growing"" their monetary value as measured by the very fiat currencies many claim are being disrupted.  But if digital tokens are to matter and if they are to enable networks of distributed trust, the industry needs to advance to adulthood.  Only with a self-regulating system, in which broadly accepted norms of behavior, modes of communication and business practices are encouraged, can the industry shake off a Wild West image of Lambo-loving scammers and move from the fringe into the mainstream.  This, by the way, is also the only way to experience true and meaningful financial growth by which opportunities are distributed beyond a small set of early adopters to a wider array of participants in the $100 trillion world economy.  As such, it is encouraging to see proactive efforts to promote best practices. The latest such effort comes from the Token Alliance, an industry initiative of the Digital Chamber of Commerce that comprises 350 global industry participants, including blockchain and token experts, technologists, economists, former regulators, and practitioners from over 20 law firms.  On Monday, the Alliance will release its first white paper, one that aims to bring two important constituencies – industry leaders and regulators – into alignment around the appropriate business and legal treatment of digital token issuances.  In particular, it seeks clarity for tokens that are not intended to be investment contracts – typically those that have a ""utility"" value in driving a decentralized network of users – and for that reason, deserve to be excluded from existing securities laws.  According to a foreword from Token Alliance co-chairs Jim Newsome, a former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and Paul Atkins, a former commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the principles outlined in the report ""are designed to help market participants understand the parameters around their activity and to act in a fair and responsible manner toward potential purchasers.""  At the same time, Newsom and Atkins add that these guidelines can help policymakers understand the technology better so as to avoid drafting draconian rules potentially creating ""an environment of regulatory arbitrage, or even worse, unintentionally decrease the attractiveness of a jurisdiction regarding innovation and jobs creation.""  It takes two...  The key point here is that this is two-way street.  On the one hand, policymakers clearly need educating – as highlighted by California Democrat Rep. Brad Sherman's ludicrous suggestion to ban bitcoin during Congressional hearings a week and a half ago.  But on the other, regulators are going to be much more willing to give the industry the regulatory space it needs to flourish if there isn't widespread public anger over unsavory and exploitative behavior in the crypto community.  After all, as smugly satisfying as it was to read all the ""Old Man Yells at Cloud"" memes that mocked Sherman, his and other lawmakers' misplaced proposals were prompted by some pretty shoddy industry behavior, especially in the initial coin offerings (ICOs) market.  Assessments of ICOs have concluded that as many as two-thirds of those in 2017 were scams. Notably, the lament heard most widely and vociferously about this problem is from within the crypto community itself, with serious developers complaining constantly about ""shitcoins"" and ""vaporware"" projects raising eight-, nine-, even ten-figure amounts without building a single thing.  Some in the community would much prefer that the whole ""ICO"" thing would go away. (In all fairness, ""ICO"" really is a terrible term, one that immediately labels tokens as purely a money-raising enterprise, substitutable for an IPO.) They want the world to recognize the relative purity of bitcoin and perhaps a smattering of other fully mined altcoins. (Ether is usually excluded from this list.) They view bitcoin and its ilk as the only true censorship-resistant systems, neither reliant on third parties to operate nor at risk of being shut down by regulators.  But token issuance can't be wished away. It's here to stay.  Irrespective of the debated legal distinctions between ""securities"" and ""utility tokens,"" sales of these digital assets have already proven to be an effective way to bootstrap the development of decentralized networks and the decentralized applications (dapps) that thrive within them. It's not clear whether pure cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin bogged with scaling challenges will ever have the capability to support the smart contract functionality that dapps require.  The case for self-regulation  Once you accept the premise that ICOs are here to stay, it should also be apparent that in order to flourish they must operate within a constructive legal framework.  This is not to say that token projects shouldn't be disruptive, but it is an acknowledgment of the need for pragmatism. It should be possible for crypto developers and entrepreneurs to hold true to their decentralizing and anti-corporate principles yet also foster a less cynical, more realistic relationship with government.  The best route to a constructive legal framework is to foster a reliable, structured system of self-regulation, which can be designed to soften the compliance blow for startups. Most of the responsibility for boosting public confidence in the technology should rest with industry participants rather than law enforcement, but fall within a predictable legal framework.  We must develop standards of accountability, attestation, reputation and certification (decentralized or otherwise) that weed out bad actors from the market and do so in a way that gives regulators confidence that the social objectives that define their mission are being upheld.  This is the basic principle behind self-regulatory organizations (SROs) at regulated exchanges and traditional certifying bodies in finance such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). This is not to say the crypto industry should follow these heavy-handed approaches, which are rightly criticized for overly protecting incumbents. Rather, it is to say that with the help of the kind of transparency and accountability offered by blockchain technology and crypto innovations such as multi-sig custody, an opportunity exists to build institutions that foster both public confidence and startup-led innovation.  For this self-regulatory approach to succeed, the authors of the Token Alliance paper argue, it is vital for governments to provide a supportive legal framework. Here, in their bid to educate regulators, they favorably describe the approach applied in the U.K. territory of Gibraltar, which requires ""adequate, accurate, and balanced disclosure of information to enable anyone considering purchasing digital tokens to make an informed decision.""  The section on Gibraltar's forward-looking framework for token regulation stands in stark contrast to preceding sections, which cover evolving legal approaches in Australia, Canada, the U.K. and the U.S. Put these together, and a picture emerges of continued uncertainty and contradictory perspectives.  On the industry education side, the Token Alliance paper takes a decent stab at laying down principles for how development teams that take on the role of ""token sponsor"" should bring their tokens into the world if they are to avoid having to comply with securities law.  Some of these proposed principles will be unwelcome to teams who've viewed ICOs as get-rich-quick opportunities. The authors argue, for example, that sponsors' white papers ""should avoid discussion of any allocation of tokens for investors, developers, founders, or employees,"" since these facts would be more relevant to an investor than a token user – highlighting the token's vulnerability to being regulated as a security.  This, however, is the price of growing up, and it's a price worth paying.  Blueprint image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Michael J.

42429434,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLyjfh,1532948404,"Bitcoin's Price Needs Move Above $8,350 to Regain Bull Bias","Bitcoin's (BTC) price is consolidating in a narrow range at press time and could regain bullish momentum above $8,350, technical charts indicate.  The leading cryptocurrency moved back above $8,000 on Friday as expected and was seen rising to recent highs above $8,500 over the weekend.  However, BTC has traded in a sideways manner in the last 60 hours. The upside has been capped around $8,300 and dips to $8,050 have been short-lived, according to Bitfinex data.  Despite the bull breakout, the price consolidation has neutralized the immediate bullish outlook, yet it is still too early to call a bearish reversal. Further, buyers may feel emboldened if the $250 trading range is breached to the upside, resulting in a resumption of the rally.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,170 on Bitfinex.  4-hour chart  BTC witnessed a descending broadening channel breakout on Friday – a continuation pattern – which signaled a revival of the rally and opened the doors to a re-test of $8,507 (July 24 high).  However, the bullish move failed to materialize and the cryptocurrency ended up creating a sideways channel over the weekend, as seen in the above chart.  An upside break of the sideways channel now would validate the descending broadening channel breakout and allow a rally to 200-day moving average (MA) of $8,468. On the other hand, a move back into the descending broadening channel could prove costly.  That said, the probability of a bullish breakout of the sideways channel is high as the major moving averages are biased toward the bulls. For instance, the 50-candle, 100-candle, and 200-candle MA are trending north and located one below the other.  Daily chart  The relative strength index (RSI) is no longer reporting overbought conditions, meaning there is room for a rally to recent highs above $8,500 on the upside break of the sideways channel seen in the 4-hour chart. Further, the 10-day MA continues to rise in a bullish manner.  View  Bitcoin's price consolidation, when viewed against the backdrop of the descending channel breakout, indicates bullish exhaustion. Consequently, the immediate bullish outlook has been neutralized.  A break above $8,340 (upper end of the sideways channel) would allow a re-test of $8,468 (200-day MA) and $8,507 (July 24 high). A daily close (as per UTC) above the 200-day MA would confirm a long-run bear-to-bull trend change.  On the downside, a fall back into the descending broadening channel would shift risk in favor of a deeper price pullback to the 100-candle MA in the 4-hour chart, currently located at $7,496.

42429428,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLyjVh,1532944838,Blockstack's First Business App Wants to Help Employees Earn More Crypto,"If cryptocurrency is decentralizing the world of money, a new bitcoin wallet startup thinks it could also help decentralize the world of work.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Misthos launched its multi-signature wallet Monday on top of Blockstack's decentralized application platform. One of the first enterprise products launched on Blockstack, the wallet is designed for project teams, investment partnerships and other ad hoc ventures to manage the divvying up of income (received as bitcoin) among their individual members.  These organizations, which often form to carry out a specific objective before disbanding (more like a Hollywood production than a corporation), ""want to have transparency into where their cash is going and want to be able to distribute their income in a fair way,"" Misthos founder Justin Carter told CoinDesk.  To that end, all proposed payouts from a venture using a Misthos wallet must be approved unanimously by the partners in that venture. Carter described this model as ""moving away from an employee-employer relationship to a group consensus about who contributed value.""  In other words, instead of a getting paid according to a salary or contract negotiated before taking on a job, the individual is compensated based on social consensus among the team. Misthos makes its money by collecting a 1.49 percent cut of the payouts.  Similarly, proposals to add partners are subject to approval by all the existing participants, and in order to kick one person out, everyone else in the group must agree to it. Several partnerships are already using Misthos to distribute bitcoin among members, including the four-person team behind Munich-based bitcoin publication Coin Trainer.  ""It helps us create a transparent environment where contributions are rewarded fairly and democratically,"" Marcel Kasper, one of the co-founders of Coin Trainer, told CoinDesk.  Eventually, this collaborative model could be applied to managing fiat currency income for projects as well, but bitcoin was a natural starting point, Carter said.  ""We are starting to build out the product on bitcoin is because of the reduced friction, as we have no institutional dependencies,"" he told CoinDesk, adding:  ""Crypto-first is about first developing a financial service for the new platform (cryptocurrencies). And once the overall experience is well-defined, adapting it to the old platforms, integrating with legacy financial institutions operating in fiat.""  Free agents  Misthos is part of a broader push across the cryptocurrency community to support less centralized employment models.  Opolis, for example, is a professional employment organization (PEO) that handles outsourced human resources functions such as benefits and payroll for employers. However, it caters to a specialized clientele, including blockchain projects and startups, and has close ties to ConsenSys, the ethereum design studio.  By the end of the month, roughly 300 Opolis users will be able to facilitate crypto or fiat payrolls, employee benefits, and tax documents through this one-stop-shop service provider. The company also runs an employment marketplace for recruiters and job seekers, and it has a grander vision of future ""decentralized employment organizations,"" or DEOs.  John Paller, a co-founder of Opolis, told CoinDesk his platform is optimized for individual contractors instead of corporate hierarchies.  ""[Freelancers] can choose and vote on any benefits they want, any number of things, including things that are out of the scope of traditional options today,"" he said. ""For example, you could have part of your income go to a group investment model.""  Both Misthos and Opolis use decentralized data solutions of some kind for worker IDs and credentials, making it easier to recruit, onboard and offboard collaborators.  ""There's also storage that Blockstack provides, and part of that we're leveraging,"" Carter said of Misthos, which uses Blockstack IDs for logins and wallet management. ""All the history of the ventures is all stored with the individual partners.""  Human factors  Stepping back, it's easy to see why these entrepreneurs see an opportunity in offering solutions tailored for project-specific, flexible employment arrangements. These days many of the ecosystem's leading developers prefer to work independently. Turnover at crypto startups is particularly high.  Indeed, Wall Street veteran turned startup advisor Jill Carlson told CoinDesk a wide range of workers with soft skills could benefit from employment opportunities modeled after open source collaborations.  In traditional freelance contract negotiations, ""You have very little leverage,"" Carlson said. ""I want to be able to do this style of work but to scale it in some way.""  On the other hand, Carlson also emphasized the importance of training and mentorship provided by traditional employers. To bring bitcoin's ethos to the workplace, some collaboration will need to take place offline, face-to-face. ""I do my best work when I'm with other people,"" she said.  Plus, in her view, it's important to consider how crypto community politics, and arguments on social media platforms where ""a lot of nuance is being lost,"" could impact project governance on Misthos, which she nevertheless said offers a compelling idea for on-chain bounty management.  Carter agreed that much of the social governance will take place off of the Misthos payroll platform.  ""The point Misthos steps in is for a form of documentation and execution,"" he said.  This is why Jude Nelson, lead blockchain engineer at Blockstack, told CoinDesk such democratic projects will require both on-chain and off-chain coordination.  He concluded:  ""On-chain smart contracts are likely necessary for users of a dapp who don't know each other. But since all partners in a Misthos venture must know one another before signing off on a payment, they are able to coordinate pay-outs off-chain without needing a potentially cumbersome on-chain smart contract.""

42429426,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLyjPh,1532941250,Korean Government Seeks to Strip Tax Perks From Crypto Exchanges,"Cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea may soon lose eligibility for significant tax benefits currently granted to smaller companies.  A proposed revision to the existing tax law, announced by the South Korean government on Monday, would exclude crypto exchanges from the category of startups or small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that can claim a tax cut of up to 100 percent, according to CoinDesk Korea.  Under the existing tax law in the country, startups and SMEs are able to apply for a deduction of 50–100 percent of their income tax or corporate tax in the first five years after their establishment, and 5–30 percent thereafter.  However, the government appears to have decided that crypto platforms do not justify the benefits, explaining that ""cryptocurrency transaction brokerage is not effective in generating added value.""  A draft revised bill will be presented to the National Assembly by Aug. 31 for parliamentary debate before a decision will be made on whether and when the updated legislation should take effect.  That said, the government recently indicated that blockchain startups working on research and development could still be eligible for tax benefits – a move that is part of the government's wider push for helping emerging technologies in the country.  The news marks the latest legislative effort in South Korea that takes a focus on cryptocurrency and tax. According to CoinDesk Korea, the government also announced in May that it would soon establish a cryptocurrency taxation system for investors.

42429419,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLyj9h,1532937624,IBM and FX Giant CLS Team Up to Launch Blockchain App Store for Banks,"Even private and permissioned blockchains need to build ecosystems and achieve network effects, just like their permissionless, public counterparts.  At least, that's the thinking behind LedgerConnect, a financial blockchain ""app store"" that aims to make it easier for banks to access distributed ledger technology (DLT) solutions from fintech and software providers, and for those vendors in turn to reach bank customers.  Announced Monday, LedgerConnect is the offspring of bank-owned currency trading utility CLS and enterprise software giant IBM, and counts major banks Barclays and Citigroup among its founding members.  In fact, nine financial institutions are participating in the proof of concept (PoC) and have selected services from a number of vendors including Baton Systems, Calypso, Copp Clark, IBM, MPhasis, OpenRisk, SynSwap and Persistent Systems.  On LedgerConnect, financial institutions will be able to access DLT-based services in areas such as know-your-customer processes, sanctions screening, collateral management, derivatives post-trade processing and reconciliation and market data.  This new hub will address a connectivity gap, where upstart fintechs and large tech firms alike are faced with the cost and complexity of spinning up their own distributed networks so banks can consume their various applications, according to Keith Bear, IBM's vice president for financial markets.  ""Having a secure network and proven infrastructure allows an app store kind of model, where banks can identify applications from certified fintech and software providers and deploy these apps over a seamless blockchain network,"" Bear told CoinDesk.  For Barclays, one of the most active banks in the DLT field, the app store is a way to test out a new approach.  Dr. Lee Braine of the investment bank CTO office at Barclays, explained that there are several different deployment options to consider when architecting distributed ledgers for live environments.  For example, if a financial market infrastructure provider like CLS is providing the governance and business services for a particular use case, then there may be an option for that market infrastructure provider to also host the nodes on behalf of the banks in order to accelerate the initial speed to market, said Braine.  ""Some banks may also look to explore the more decentralized deployment option of hosting their nodes themselves,"" said Braine. ""By participating in the LedgerConnect proof-of-concept, Barclays is gaining experience of a distributed ledger private network aimed at connecting both market infrastructure-hosted nodes and bank-hosted nodes.""  LedgerConnect itself runs partly on a permissioned blockchain based on IBM's blockchain platform, which in turn was built on Hyperledger Fabric, and all the apps currently in the store are Hyperledger-based. However, the founders are open to other enterprise blockchain solutions making use of the app store.  ""We are not averse to supporting other ledger implementations, whether it is R3's Corda, whether it is Quorum (provided these techs are robust and can meet the needs we have from security perspective etc.),"" said Ram Komarraju, head of innovation and solution delivery at CLS.  He added:  ""Our expectation is that in principle we will not be limited to one technology only.""  Original consortium  Stepping back, CLS can perhaps be thought of as the original blockchain consortium.  Granted, it was founded in 2002 (six years before the first blockchain was conceived) to provide plumbing for FX trades. But it's been testing blockchain technology since early 2015, before Hyperledger started and when R3 was still flying under the radar.  The early CLS blockchain efforts were later formalized into CLSNet, a way of testing blockchain to match and net trades involving a range of new currencies not on the main platform, keeping immature blockchain technology separate from the core settlement engine used by 60 large financial institutions.  ""There is a lot of trade processing we do for banks and buy-side firms, without getting to the last mission-critical aspects of settlement itself,"" said Komarraju.  As such, CLSNet will be one of the first applications on the new LedgerConnect portal. All these apps have been selected in the hope of removing typical reconciliation efforts and data duplication (remedies include things like capturing digitalized master agreements of derivatives contracts on a single ledger for example).  ""Look at capital markets today, every bank has its own silo office systems even though they are trading typically with a counterparty that has the same type of business logic but using the same technology stack,"" added Komarraju.  IBM and CLS go back a ways; the main CLS platform was built by IBM. And LedgerConnect is a way of joining the dots between their respective financial infrastructure and blockchain work, at the same time extending the blockchain work CLS has been doing beyond foreign exchange into other capital market domains.  ""This is really leveraging the combination of CLS's position as a globally systemically important market utility owned by the banks, and also IBM's investment in that,"" said Komarraju.  PoC fatigue  Unlike the average PoC, LedgerConnect is at quite an advanced state, according to Komarraju.  ""We didn't start this on Monday,"" he said. ""We have institutions that have selected a number of use cases and these have been implemented and we are in the very late stages of proving the technology.""  While Barclays and Citi are the only banks being named at this time, big hitters like JPMorgan and Goldman, which are both part of CLSNet, are logical candidates to take part.  Another list of likely suspects are the banks on the we.trade platform, which also uses Hyperledger in the form of an IBM software-as-a-service (SaaS) model.  Explaining why CLS couldn't reveal all the participants in LedgerConnect, Komarraju hinted that some of these big banks are experiencing a bit of blockchain PoC fatigue.  ""We cannot share the names of full list of banks because we haven't (yet) received the approvals from some of them. Some of them wanted to wait until the proof of concept is complete and others needed more time for internal approvals,"" he said.  Meanwhile, Bear of IBM said the whole reason we are seeing PoC fatigue is because so many of them don't progress. While this can be because of a weak business case, or one that doesn't need a blockchain, oftentimes it comes down to the cost and complexity of getting a network up and running.  ""In many ways we are trying to get rid of that PoC fatigue,"" said Bear. ""I know we have to go through a PoC to do that, but it's kind of inevitable.""

The multinational, one of Australia's ""Big Four"" banks, said in a statement on Monday that some 37,000 pounds of almonds were shipped from Australia to Germany and were tracked via a private blockchain platform developed by the bank on top of the ethereum network.  Participating nodes of the blockchain system included key parties along the supply chain, such as agriculture producer Olam Orchards and logistic carriers, as well as port operator Patrick Terminals and the Port of Melbourne.  The CBA said the blockchain-based system stores the data of containers, documents and financial transactions on a distributed network. As such, different partners can simultaneously view and track information about a shipment in real-time – data including the shipment's status or the temperature and humidity of the containers.  ""This level of data provided partners in the supply chain with a greater level of transparency and efficiency regarding the location, condition and authentication of the goods being transported,"" the bank said in the release.  Olam Orchards' supply chain manager Emma Roberts commented in the announcement:  ""Trade inefficiency can be extremely detrimental to our business.

On Tuesday, The Icahn School of Medicine said the Center for Biomedical Blockchain Research would be created inside the school's Institute for Next Generation Healthcare, which researches the application of artificial intelligence, robotics, genomic sequencing, sensors and wearable devices in medicine, New York-based news organization Crain's reported.  The center's staff will conduct academic research on blockchain in medicine, as well as create their own prototype networks. The possible use cases include drug development and preventing the sale of counterfeit drugs, clinical trials and a better research reproducibility, Healthcare IT News wrote.  The new center will be run by Joel Dudley, executive vice president of Precision Health at Mount Sinai and a former senior data scientist at Pivotal Software, which researches the use of artificial intelligence in biology. Dudley was previously involved in designing predictive models in healthcare.  His new focus will revolve around developing predictive health applications using the information from electronic health records, wearable devices and other digital sources.  The project began with bringing together a database of 144 companies that are working on blockchain projects related to healthcare. They include CoverUs, which works on allowing patients to get paid for their health data via a specialized exchange, and Embleema, which is designed to connect patient-generated health data and electronic medical records in a common secure repository.  The companies on the list have raised a combined $670 million through initial coin offerings, Crain's wrote.
