42397916,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEWx9,1409526614,"All Things Alt: Dogecoin's Future Prep, Strange Gold Pegs and a Friendly Scam","Sad the summer months are nearly over? Excited about what the fall may bring for the altcoin community, or the digital currency world as a whole?  You aren’t alone, as many investors, traders, developers and everyone in between are no doubt gearing up for what could be a make-or-break season for block chain technology. While the last few weeks haven’t been easy for those in altcoin circles, the promise of the near future is no doubt exciting for all those involved.  Uro unveils emerging market exchange system  The urocoin project has recently unveiled or released a number of updates that continue to build on the existing infrastructure surrounding the altcoin.  On August 15th, the URO development team unveiled Nuro, a digital currency wallet designed with many elements common in online banking interfaces. The open-source initiative, detailed in a recent Bitcoin Talk forum post, is focused on delivering functionality for both smartphones and less technologically advanced mobile devices.  In a statement, the team behind the project said:  “Originally developed to address the needs of urea fertilizer wholesalers and farmers by providing a wallet that would minimize the technological resources needed to permit fast, secure transactions. The platform’s inclusion of bitcoin, urocoin and litecoin, with more coins to follow, gives Nuro a universal utility that enables traditional banking consumers across the globe to easily transition into trustless, decentralized banking.”  This wallet app release was followed by an announcement last week by the Uro Foundation, the umbrella group overseeing the various initiatives involving the digital currency, that a new exchange system would be developed in emerging markets.  According to the organization, the first exchange is expected to open in Cambodia, with more to follow throughout the region. The exchange system development is part of a broader process described to CoinDesk in an interview with developer Bohan Huang, who said that the goal was to create an environment in which both farmers and traders stand to benefit.  Ripoffcoin seeks education through humor  The all-too-common scams in alternative digital currency circles have led to calls for higher standards to be adopted by the community, or at least a greater degree of accountability than exists today.  While grassroots-level initiatives have had an impact and altcoin exchanges are doing their best to improve vetting processes, the fact remains that investors remain at risk – though some argue that research and a critical eye can help greatly as well.  A rather odd attempt to help educate the community about the risks of an altcoin scam has taken shape in the ripoffcoin project, which is best exemplified by the openness of the development team who say that yes, the initiative is not a real coin project. Rather, the team wants to show that too many investors in the space are after a quick buck rather than backing meaningful initiatives.  Much of the content produced by the ripoffcoin team takes a comedic stance, including an open letter addressed to the management of now-defunct bitcoin exchange Mt Gox. The letter stated that the ripoffcoin community was being forced to pull its support for the exchange, citing concerns that it was at risk of being scammed by the site’s operators.  CoinDesk spoke with the lead developer of ripoffcoin, who commented that the project was focused on trying to teach an important lesson while having some fun at the same time, saying:  “It’s about educating people a bit, showing people that most things are not what they seem to be, and of course, having a lot of fun.”  The developer added that, in time, ripoffcoin could become utilized for the same purpose as dogecoin: social tipping and gifting. That future, he concluded, depends on how the coin’s public image develops in the weeks ahead.  Dogecoin prepares for AuxPOW  Preparations for dogecoin’s adoption of auxiliary proof-of-work (AuxPOW), which will allow merge-mining with litecoin, are underway, setting the stage for the internet’s favorite meme-themed digital currency to add some extra firepower – and security – to its network.  In recent days, members of dogecoin development community have taken to the alt’s subreddit to help supporters, miners and everyone in between get ready for the hard fork. One post focused on contingency preparations should certain shibes find themselves unable to sync with the updated code.  The post noted that community members shouldn’t wait for near-term updates. As the post explained, the to-be-released code will be the definitive one for the immediate future, adding:  “Some of you may be holding off on updating to 1.8 because you’re expecting another client to come out and figure you’ll wait for that. That new client is 1.8.1 and it is specifically scheduled to come out after the AuxPoW fork. What that means is your existing client will stop being part of the main chain, before the update comes out.”  As one commenter added: “Don’t panic!” But with testing underway – the development team began work nearly two weeks ago - the dogecoin community is already pressing ahead on the hard fork.  Strange alt of the week  Here on All Things Alt, we’ve shined the spotlight on more than a few strange ways to back the value of a digital currency. From the unsigned confessions of network participants to the estimated daily oil production of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, many approaches have been taken to establish some level of underlying value to a coin.  Goldenloafyanukovichcoin (sign: GNY) utilizes what may be the strangest commodity backing for a coin to date: a two-kilogram piece of gold known infamously as the “golden bread loaf”. As detailed by The Moscow Times, the lump of gold was confiscated when former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich fled the country as it descended into revolution several months ago.  For this unique form of backing, GNY has won this week’s Strange Alt of the Week Award.  According to the coin’s official Bitcoin Talk post, GNY leverages the X11 hashing algorithm, with a max supply of roughly 130,000 coins. The developer stated in the post that the goal was to create a digital currency with a one-of-a-kind way of underpinning GNY’s value, saying:  “Our coin [was] created to share the cost of a massive paperweight in the form of a full-size loaf weighing two kilograms, made of gold, a valuable item found in the former residence of Viktor Yanukovych near Kiev.”  Development on GNY appears to have slowed, although the coin is available for purchase on the altcoin exchange C-CEX.

42397917,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEWvB,1409505308,3 Forces Shaping Next-Generation Bitcoin Exchanges,"Investors and venture capitalists have developed a healthy appetite for funding bitcoin exchange services in recent months.  As the exchange system represents a key element of the broader bitcoin economy, it’s unsurprising that these companies are able to secure working capital. A closer look at recent news events, however, reveals that underlying trends may be a motivating factor.  In the aftermath of Mt Gox’s much-publicized collapse, a new breed of exchanges has moved to fill the vacuum previously occupied by what was once the most popular bitcoin exchange.  From China to Silicon Valley, the companies behind the world’s most active bitcoin exchanges are raising funds and using those resources to build and deploy stronger and more user-friendly platforms, ones that go beyond Mt Gox in many key ways.  Overall, the funding rounds reflect three trends currently at work in the exchange space. Today's bitcoin exchanges are internationally focused, institutional investor-approved and compliant (or as much as possible) with local laws.  1. International markets  OKCoin, the largest China-based bitcoin exchange by volume, raised $10m in a Series A funding round back in March. The deal touted notable participants including Ceyuan, a VC fund that was among the first to develop in mainland China.  In the time since, the company has put that funding to work. As revealed in subsequent conversations with CoinDesk, OKCoin has begun to make big investments in its international services with an eye on capturing a significant market share outside of mainland China.  Today, the firm has roughly 100 employees and has even hired key talent from the US market in conjunction with its expansion.  From a broader perspective, exchanges can utilize funding to help integrate with the traditional financial system. This process also give exchanges the resources to build services that make it easier for users familiar with other platforms to interface successfully.  As noted by Changpeng Zhao, OKCoin’s chief technology officer:  “The image that we want to build, and we will build, is that of a professional financial services company. It’s not just an Internet company, it’s not just a bitcoin company. We are an exchange.”  2. Investor interest  Though it wasn't announced until March, Bitstamp raised $10m in new funding from Pantera Capital Management in 2013. The move gave the Europe-based bitcoin exchange a significant boost during a time of significant evolution in the exchange marketplace.  During the period Bitstamp purportedly received the funding, bitcoin exchanges were seeing larger volumes in response to the rising price of the digital currency. This was also a period of increasing interest among deep-pocketed investment groups, and Pantera’s deal would be the first of many to come.  The hedge fund itself further reflects its growing institutional interest in digital currency. Pantera is a bitcoin-focused investment fund formed in conjunction with Fortress Investment Group, Ribbit Capital and Benchmark Capital.  3. Legal realities  The largest deal to involve a US-based bitcoin exchange in 2014 thus far, Kraken parent company Payward, Inc.’s $5m Series A round, was intended to raise money to fund overseas development.  The Series A round was led by Hummingbird Ventures, an early-phase VC fund. Given the international – and 24-hour – nature of the bitcoin market, Kraken and other exchanges look to funding as a way to expand internationally. Yet, this deal also highlighted another major expense that bitcoin exchanges have to contend with: legal compliance.  Kraken CEO Jesse Powell told CoinDesk when his company announced its $5m round that, ultimately, much of that funding would be directed toward legal expenses.  He explained:  “We’re really excited, we’ve been putting the round together for a long time, the funding is going to go to development, regulatory stuff, getting all the licenses in the US and around the world. A lot of it is going to go into legal.”  Powell added that companies in the exchange sector no doubt face increased scrutiny due to the nature of their business and the still-developing regulatory environment for bitcoin.  As a result, it’s possible that exchanges may require additional resources in the future to maintain compliance.

42397906,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEWmK,1409494556,The Short-Term View on Bitcoin Remittances,"Luis Buenaventura is the head of product at Satoshi Citadel Industries, and “dreams of a world where everyone has access to everything”.      Satoshi Citadel Industries manages several different digital currency services and sites, including Bitmarket, in-beta exchange Coinage, photo-sharing site Bitstars.ph, and remittance service ReBit.      SCI is also rolling out pre-loaded bitcoin cards as a way to get bitcoin into newcomers’ wallets.    Remittance is often cited as the one of the primary ways that bitcoin would change the global financial landscape, by virtue of the cryptocurrency’s microscopic transfer fees and region-agnostic transmission.  Advocates and enthusiasts often point to exorbitant remittance fees as a sign of an established industry that is ripe for disruption.  A recent Business Insider study projects global savings of 90% (US$42bn) if we were to adopt bitcoin-based remittance on a worldwide scale. But what does it take for this paradise of free-flowing bytes and money to actually become a reality?  The road ahead, initially paved with libertarian dreams and well-meaning naiveté, has some missing segments that have yet to be filled in.  'Half a business'  In a recent interview on Let’s Talk Bitcoin, crypto-evangelist Richard Boase refers to BitPesa, a well-known bitcoin remittance service based in Kenya, as “half a business”.  In order to understand this, you need to understand how the average bitcoin remittance business in the developing world works.  An overseas customer wants to send money to a friend overseas, so they visit the website of a bitcoin remittance company in the relevant country and type in the amount of money they want to send. The site responds with a BTC invoice. The customer whips out his or her smartphone, scans and confirms the transfer, and bitcoins come flying out of their virtual wallet and into that of the remittance company.  On the local side of the process, the company raises the equivalent amount in fiat and delivers it to the customer’s nominated recipient.  Every bitcoin remittance service is, at its core, just a company that buys up bitcoins, as all it is doing is taking its customers’ BTC and paying their nominated recipients for it in fiat. This is why it’s only “half a business”.  Inevitably, the company will amass more BTC than it needs and run out of the fiat it needs to make payouts, that is, unless it also has a related service that sells the surplus coins.  In order to sustain this constant stream of incoming BTC and outgoing fiat, a remittance provider needs to either be very liquid or be very lively on the trading desks. This is easier when bitcoin’s market value is rising, but these past few weeks of tepid ups-and-downs have not been kind to the latter strategy.  The cost of compliance  Regulatory compliance, as described in an earlier CoinDesk piece, is one of the root causes of expensive remittance fees. The US, as a prime example, blurs the line between customer protection and outright protectionism by requiring money service businesses to obtain licences in 43 separate states. Furthermore, in California, for instance, the surety bond starts at $250,000.  Obtaining a licence in the US is the single largest barrier to entry into the remittance industry and explains, at least partially, why there has been so little innovation in the space. BitPesa tellingly opts to avoid the issue altogether and doesn’t accept customers from the US at all.  The sneaker API  Getting the bitcoins from the sender over to the company in the relevant country isn’t the end of the story. Once the BTC has made its trans-oceanic leap, the final challenge is in bridging the last mile – getting the local currency from the company headquarters into the hands of the waiting recipient.  In the Philippines, as in most Asian countries with substantial diaspora, there are dozens of options, including over-the-counter bank deposits, pawnshop/cash pickup centers, telco-backed mobile wallets and door-to-door delivery.  There are two problems, however. The first is there’s no clear market leader, so instead of specialising in one fulfilment method, a money transfer business instead needs to somehow integrate with all of them.  Second, none of these methods have any kind of web-service automation, so the act of taking funds from the company’s accounts and delivering them to a given fulfilment provider’s branch office must be done by physically visiting the establishment.  The good news is that labour is cheap in the developing world, and the sneakernet is alive and well. There is a substantially larger overhead to managing full-time manpower than a handful of JSON-RPC connections, but given the absence of the latter, such businesses must subsist via the former.  The final calculation  Although it is true that bitcoin reduces the cost of money transmission to next to nothing, the network isn’t the most expensive part of the money-transfer value chain. It’s actually compliance and logistics, both of which are sectors that bitcoin as a technology can address only tangentially.  In the short term, a bitcoin-powered remittance service will be severely hobbled by these realities and thus can only mount a mildly competitive alternative to traditional providers, and not the mind-blowing sea change that evangelists envision.  In a world where cryptocurrencies were ubiquitous, regulatory compliance could be rendered obsolete and logistics costs could disappear. That paradise might be down the road, but we’re not quite there yet.

42397918,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEWy8,1409479224,5 US States Poised to Promote Bitcoin-Friendly Regulation,"Given the recent critiques of New York and its proposed framework for bitcoin businesses, many of the law's opponents are no doubt hoping the state and its regulators will alter the bill during its now extended comment period.  After all, New York's BitLicense proposal, once approved, could prove influential at shaping wider US bitcoin regulation, a fact recently underscored by New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) superintendent Ben Lawsky in an interview with CoinDesk.  Of course, while vocal opponents of the bill and its controversial provisions await more guidance, there remains the possibility that another US state will introduce a framework that proves more enticing to the bitcoin industry and its interests.  The ability for states to regulate and pass laws is what makes America unique in many ways. So it should not come as a surprise that some US states could see the backlash against New York's proposal as an opportunity to position their jurisdictions as more accepting of digital currencies and the jobs and investment the industry can attract.  In this piece, CoinDesk takes a look at some of the US states that could be poised to pursue such a path.  Texas  Owing to its former status as a sovereign nation, Texas has a long history of independence, a trait that its lawmakers and citizens alike take pride in. Texas operates its own electrical grid, has no income tax and has introduced a favorable regulatory framework for bitcoin exchanges.  As such, it should come as no surprise that the state has produced vocal bitcoin advocates.  For example, Steve Stockman, a US Representative for the 36th Congressional District of Texas, has indicated in the past that he favors the bitcoin industry as a way to create jobs in his home state.  In line with his beliefs, Stockman will reportedly introduce a bill to change bitcoin’s status from property, as is currently used for IRS reporting, to currency, a distinction long lobbied for by the bitcoin industry.  Outside of Stockman's efforts, however, Texas also has in the past courted technology companies like Amazon seeking to avoid charging sales taxes on customers – an example of favorable treatment for digital businesses.  New Mexico  New Mexico is already known as a state where bitcoin businesses can get things done. The state’s Financial Institutions Division does not license or regulate money transmitters, making it a friendly place for digital currency-related ventures.  That’s the primary reason why the first bitcoin ATM in the US was launched there, as its operator was easily able to comply with state laws.  Despite the lax regulatory environment in New Mexico, the state’s Regulation and Licensing Department did put out an alert regarding the risks of virtual currencies.  Yet, the regulatory body indicated it was “evaluating the developing market for bitcoin and other forms of virtual currency”, according to Alan Wilson, Director of the New Mexico Securities Division.  New Hampshire  The tiny New England state of New Hampshire takes its state rights seriously, a fact evidenced by its not-so-subtle state motto – “Live Free or Die”.  This has led to growing support for the state's bitcoin movement. Andrew Hemingway, a Republican candidate for governor has notably embraced bitcoin as part of a libertarian-leaning campaign stance, parlaying his policies to gain new followers in the process.  He says that the weekly New Hampshire bitcoin meetup regularly attracts 50-60 people every session – folks who believe that cryptocurrencies are aligned with libertarian ideals.  Further, Hemingway makes it clear he wants to attract bitcoin businesses, telling CoinDesk:  “Companies are being regulated out of business, so they are looking for places to move. A state like New Hampshire, for instance, has the right to compete against a state like New York.”  California  As far as bitcoin is concerned, California is the capital of digital currency in the US. It’s no wonder, then, that the state is attempting to build the right framework – in a cautious way – to help influence innovation, a hallmark of the state.  There’s a lot at stake – California leads the way in bitcoin-related jobs, housing a majority of the industry's engineering and technology-driven talent.  David Kaufman, a consultant with Capital Advisors who helped to usher in California’s HN 8129 bill acknowledging virtual currency as legal money within the state, told CoinDesk that it is expected the state legislature will adopt “friendly regulations down the road”.  That’s a major reversal from just a year ago, when California sent the Bitcoin Foundation a cease-and-desist letter for violating various financial codes.  Since then, California has led the way in bitcon-related venture capital investment. According to the most recent CoinDesk State of Bitcoin Report, 48% of all bitcoin related VC went to Silicon Valley startups in the second quarter of 2014.  Colorado  As the first state to legalize marijuana, Colorado’s interest in adopting virtual currencies is twofold. For one, the state has seen an uptick in its government coffers as a result of being the first to adopt a regulated and taxed marijuana economy.  Additionally, the state's economy has struggled to get along with the traditional banking sector – it seems accounts could be closed for no reason, at any time.  If there’s one thing that distributed money like bitcoin can accomplish, it is a better transport and transaction mechanism over cash – something marijuana dispensaries which cannot get bank accounts must conduct all their business in.  Alternative currency efforts such as Potcoin have been developed specifically for the used of marijuana ventures. Innovations such as vending machines accepting bitcoin for marijuana are also novel ideas that can reduce overhead as well as thwart potential security concerns with human handling of both pot and cash at the same time.  Of course, major bitcoin payment processors have stated that they will not do business with companies that violate federal law, meaning should Colorado move to embrace bitcoin, this industry may still face problems promoting wider digital currency adoption.  What states do you expect to promote relaxed bitcoin regulations? Weigh in below.
