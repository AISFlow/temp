The month is expected to follow bullish trends that were triggered in the previous month and bitcoin has not been disappointed in this regard. However, some metrics remain low compare to the price of BTC. This could be as a result of investors taking profit in the market but low enough to draw attention to them. BTC had seen a lot of investment pour into it the week after the first ETFs went live. The record-breaking $1.4 billion inflow for the week had pushed the price of the digital asset towards a new all-time high. Yet, subsequent weeks have not fared as well in the market. One of the ways this decreased inflow has shone through has been spot trading volumes for the asset.

42396592,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT4XPy,1635974818,Federal Reserve to Taper Money Printing That Fueled Bitcoin Bets,"The U.S. Federal Reserve announced plans to taper its $120-billion-a-month in bond purchases, taking the first step toward winding down a post-coronavirus money-printing program that has inspired many investors to buy bitcoin as a hedge against inflation.  The Fed said Wednesday in a statement that it will reduce the pace of asset purchases by $15 billion a month starting this month. Purchases of U.S. Treasurys will drop to $70 billion a month from $80 billion, while purchases of government-backed mortgage securities will decline to $35 billion a month from $40 billion.  Under the plan, the Fed will continue to wind down its purchases by $15 billion every month until the program concludes during the middle of next year.  “The committee judges that similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month, but it is prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook,” the Fed’s monetary policy committee, known as the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, said in the statement.  The asset purchases – a form of stimulus funded by newly created money, known as “quantitative easing,” or QE – have helped to more than double the size of the Fed’s balance sheet since March 2020, to about $8.6 trillion as of last week.  Bitcoin price  The U.S. central bank left interest rates unchanged at close to 0%, but a growing number of analysts in traditional markets are predicting the Fed might have to start hiking the benchmark rate to tamp down inflation at a time when U.S. consumer prices are rising at a clip not seen on a sustained basis in three decades.  So If the Fed stays the course and tilts hawkish on inflation, bitcoin might look incrementally less attractive as a hedge against dollar debasement, and the cryptocurrency’s price could come under downward pressure similar to the predictions for the stock market.  Bitcoin’s price briefly dropped after the statement but by press time was essentially unchanged around $62,300. The Fed’s decision had been fully telegraphed by officials prior to the meeting, and thus may have been anticipated by the market.  “On one hand, tightened monetary policy may lead to less rapid growth of bitcoin demand, as many use it to hedge inflation, and less QE in theory means less inflation,” said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of the cryptocurrency hedge fund BitBull Capital. “On the other hand, the effects of the largest QE in history may lead to the largest inflation in history, regardless of the Fed attempting to scale back. If this happens, we expect demand, and prices, for bitcoin to rise to new all-time highs.“  DiPasquale said that BitBull has a price target of $80,000 for bitcoin by the end of 2021.  ‘Expected to be transitory’  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell had signaled during a meeting in September that there was “broad support” to begin tapering of the asset purchases, based on a plan to complete the effort “sometime around the middle of next year, which seems appropriate.”  A growing group of high-profile investors including the legendary hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones II and the venture capitalist Peter Thiel have joined many crypto traders in betting that bitcoin can be effective as a hedge against inflation. That’s mainly due to the limits on new supplies of bitcoin, as hard-coded into the 12-year-old blockchain’s underlying programming.  JPMorgan analysts wrote recently that more investors are seeing the cryptocurrency as an inflation hedge.  But bitcoin also has often been highly correlated with U.S. stocks, which can come under downward pressure when the Fed tightens monetary policy, because higher borrowing costs often translate to higher financing costs for companies, potentially becoming a drag on quarterly profits.  In Wednesday’s statement, the FOMC said it noted that inflation was “elevated” but said the factors behind the consumer price increases were “expected to be transitory.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/03/federal-reserve-to-taper-money-printing-that-fueled-bitcoin-bets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f96da102c80b8292bdacb83fb75ecaaaa16aa054-1440x1079.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42396617,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT4Xhg,1635974507,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Holds Above $60K After Fed Taper Announcement,"Bitcoin traded in a choppy price range on Wednesday as traders reacted to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s plans to taper its $120-billion-a-month in bond purchases.  The unprecedented amount of buying by the Fed as part of its monetary stimulus plan known as quantitative easing (QE) provided a tailwind for financial assets, such as cryptocurrencies, deemed by the market to be risky. But lower liquidity as a result of the tapering could encourage investors to reduce their exposure to crypto and other risks.  Bitcoin’s price fell by about 5% during the announcement by the Fed’s policymaking Federal Open Market Committee in its post-meeting statement, but buyers were quick to step in around the $60,000 support level.  Analysts remain bullish on cryptocurrencies, but some have pointed to declining trading volume as a sign of slowing upside momentum in prices.  “We haven’t even seen an episode of FOMO (fear of missing out) yet, so the sharpest bull-run part of the rally is yet to come,” Alex Kuptsikevich, an analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “Despite BTC’s very sluggish performance in recent days, what still draws attention is the apparent support on dips,” Kuptsikevich wrote.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $62,997.19, -0.64%  Ether (ETH): 4,630.40, +2.78%  S&P 500: 4,660.57, +0.65%  Gold: 1,772.56, -0.83%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.596%  Bitcoin rally on low trading volume  Trading volume in the bitcoin spot market continued to decline despite bitcoin’s price rally over the past month. The chart below shows the seven-day average BTC trading volume, which is down almost $1 billion from the previous week, according to data compiled by Arcane Research.  But some analysts expect higher trading activity if BTC rallies through the end of the year.  “The trading volume has decreased substantially since bitcoin hit an all-time high on October 20, and it should increase considerably if bitcoin is to challenge its all-time high again soon,” Arcane wrote in a Wednesday report.  Trading has also been relatively quiet on the Coinbase crypto exchange over the past week, with BTC accounting for 21% of total volume. However, the company noted that trading activity is starting to increase in alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) as bitcoin’s price stalls.  “Ether (ETH) volumes have also seen an increase to 18.51%, relegating SHIB to the third spot,” Coinbase wrote in a newsletter to institutional clients, referring to the shiba inu coin. “It is possible to envisage a scenario where ETH will again overtake BTC in terms of volumes as we head into year-end if this narrative gains steam.”  Altcoin roundup  Layer 2 coins are thriving as Ethereum costs are rising: The average fee on Ethereum has given rise by 2,300% since late June and is now at $56. This appears to be driving investors to coins associated with layer 2 products that facilitate faster and cheaper transactions, and those of rival programmable blockchains, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reported. This allowed Solana’s SOL token, which surged in price by 13% in the past 24 hours to $234, to pass Cardano’s ADA as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency, according to CoinGecko. At the same time, smart-contract blockchain Polkadot’s DOT token also rallied to an all-time high of $53.37 early Wednesday.  EOS Foundation CEO says, “EOS, as it stands, is a failure:” At a virtual event on Wednesday, Yves La Rose, CEO of the EOS Foundation, claimed the EOS blockchain protocol’s native currency, EOS, has been “a terrible investment,” CoinDesk’s Andrew Thurman reported. La Rose’s speech places much of the blame on backer and former developer Block.one, which the project will no longer be relying on for guidance. He also said that EOS was “a victim of its own success,” and that it was put in a position of “having to meet extreme expectations as it raised extreme sums.”  Kraken fails to list SHIB: Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has failed to list popular meme token SHIB on its exchange after it promised to do so on Twitter, CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen reported. In a tweet on Monday, the exchange said that if they got 2,000 “likes,” it would list shiba inu on Tuesday. However, at press time on Wednesday, SHIB is still not available to buy and sell on Kraken despite the tweet having over 77,000 likes. The lack of action by Kraken has triggered anger on social media, with one user tweeting, “[Y]ou have lost me as lifetime customer now.”  Relevant news  JPMorgan Report Says CBDCs Can Save Firms $100B a Year in Cross-Border Costs  Riot Blockchain Raises Hashrate Guidance by 11.7% for 2022  Direxion Withdraws Application for Short Bitcoin Futures ETF  China’s CBDC Has Been Used for $9.7B of Transactions  Digital Currency Group Achieves $10B Valuation in $700M Secondary Sale  Other markets  Most digital assets in the CoinDesk 20 ended the day higher.

42410964,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtkPt,1635974157,How Yield Farming on Curve Is Quietly Conquering DeFi,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and their associated yields have earned a unique reputation across traditional finance and even the broader crypto market as risky, unsustainable and even Ponzi-esque. Where does the yield come from and how is it 100 times higher than the rates offered from bonds, certificate of deposits or savings accounts?  A handful of protocols essentially created peer-to-peer lending, trading and insurance protocols that remove a middleman like a bank, exchange or insurance company and allow smaller users to take their place. Here are some examples at a very basic level:  Uniswap and Curve allow any user to create a market and earn trading fees from token swaps.  Aave and Compound allow any user to provide collateralized loans to other speculators and earn a vast majority of the borrow interest.  Maker allows any user to create its decentralized stablecoin, DAI, by providing crypto as collateral.  Aside from offering low trading and lending fees, DeFi protocols have been generous in giving away their “governance tokens.” These native tokens often hold rights to a small percentage of protocol earnings, much as a company might pay dividends to shareholders.  Furthermore, some of the most prominent protocols have given token holders a share in the responsibility to control the future plans, upgrades and offerings of the project itself. Curve DAO and its native token CRV are examples of that governance model with the token playing a vital role in the protocol and the broader DeFi universe.  Introduction to Curve DAO  Until recently, Curve had been extremely under discussed, considering the major role it holds in DeFi across blockchains. Recent shifts in tokenomics led its native token, CRV, to become net deflationary; subsequently, the price is up 122% since the token became deflationary. To understand DeFi yields, it is almost essential to understand the inner workings of Curve. So what does Curve do and how does it do it?  Curve is a decentralized exchange, known for its pegged-asset swaps like fiat-pegged stablecoins or assets that trade at a 1-1 ratio. With over $3 billion in deposits, Curve’s largest pool is known as 3pool and contains DAI, USDC and USDT. The stablecoin pools have gained traction offering high liquidity and low fees (0.004%), because Curve uses its native token to reward liquidity providers instead of higher swap fees. Below you can see the results of swapping $75 million from USDC to USDT on Curve, Sushi and Uniswap, with Curve optimizing the swap with significantly less slippage than its competitors. Slippage is the difference between expected and executed price on a trade, or how far away from market price the trade executes.  CRV tokenomics  CRV holders may “stake” their tokens in the platform and lock them in fixed periods of between one week and four years to decide their voting weight. Depending on the amount of Curve locked and the length of time locked, stakers are given an adjusted amount of vote-escrowed Curve (veCRV). veCRV holders are then able to vote on how CRV rewards are distributed across Curve’s pools by assigning weight to the “pool gauge” aligning with their financial interests. The gauge is an instrument to measure which pool is weighted most heavily with rewards and gauge votes occur biweekly via Snapshot.  Subsequently, a system for bribing veCRV holders to vote in favor of specific gauge weightings has arisen. Projects like Abracadabra pay veCRV holders in their native token for weekly bribes to boost the yield on their decentralized stablecoins, increasing demand for their own project. Abracadabra has paid the equivalent of $1.9 million to veCRV holders willing to vote for their stablecoin pool in the last two weeks alone, now giving their pool 32.5% of the relative gauge weight.  Holders of veCRV also earn a portion of the protocol’s revenue via swap fees. According to Curve’s documents, “A community-led proposal introduced a 50% admin fee on all trading fees. Those fees are collected and used to buy 3CRV, the LP token for the TriPool, which are then distributed to veCRV holders.”  The dynamic capabilities of veCRV have kept the demand for CRV strong, even with inflation, to match the demand for maximized yield and low-fee swaps. However, as seen below, the emission schedule has slowed because of the end of early user rewards. The demand for locking CRV has also increased, turning the asset net “deflationary.” The CRV that is locked for voting is not considered part of the token supply, as it is non-liquid and the majority is locked for the next three to four years.  The foundation for DeFi  The dynamic capabilities of the CRV token and ecosystem have made the project an attractive building block for several other DeFi projects, namely Yearn and Convex. The two projects can be considered “yield optimizers” that rotate assets between Curve pools and remove the complexities of efficiently using the CRV token. Both protocols allow users to deposit Curve liquidity positions (LPs) or CRV into their vaults, which then harvest rewards – both compounding the LP position and reinvesting in CRV to optimize yields.  Yearn was born out of the “DeFi summer” and started to quickly pull in large ownership of veCRV, holding nearly 10% of the supply when Convex was launched. In a few months, however, Convex was able to swallow over 35% of the veCRV supply. The competition for control over Curve’s gauge voting and yield boost was dubbed “Curve Wars,” and some in the DeFi community believed the projects were playing a zero-sum game. Bankless HQ has highlighted where the two protocols differ and how each gets its competitive edge.  “There are three key differences between Convex and Yearn:  On Convex, users will have to manually reinvest their rewards back into the different vaults to compound rather than it being done automatically on Yearn  Convex has a lower fee structure, as it keeps 16% of profits in the form of a performance fee, while Yearn charges a 2% management fee along with 20% of profits  On Convex, users can “farm” CVX, which can also be reinvested back into the various vaults.  The two protocols are undeniably competing on some level, but their combined presence seems to grow the Curve pie as a whole. In fact, Yearn is likely one of the largest depositors in certain Convex strategies, with $724 million deposited in Covex’s sETH strategy and $586 million deposited in the usdn3crv strategy.  While Convex supporters have been pitching that the protocol now owns a much larger portion of veCRV than Yearn does, Yearn developer @bantg suggests that Yearn’s responsibility for a large portion of Convex’s CRV holdings and total value locked, or TVL, makes simple metrics less valuable for comparing the two products.  Over time, Yearn and Convex appear to be symbiotic and a net positive for each other. More clear, however, is the positive effect they both have on Curve and CRV. If the demand for stable yields continues to grow, the fight for maximized boosts on Curve has only just begun. Yearn and Convex will continue to purchase CRV in an attempt to keep up with their increasing TVL and to offer the highest possible yield.  Early user rewards are also coming to an end, meaning CRV emissions are topping out.. A recent CoinDesk article highlighted CRV’s recent performance and why it is standing out, even as the wave of “dog coins” is taking over the crypto trading narrative. The chart below shows a very clear trend:  Curve’s importance in the DeFi ecosystem  Over the past six months, Curve has made just $34.1 million in swap fees, even though it has $16.5 billion in TVL on Ethereum’s main network and has kept its trading volume consistently high. Curve and its liquidity providers make $0.40 on every $1,000 in trading volume, compared with another popular decentralized exchange, Sushi, which makes $3 on every $1,000 in trading volume for its liquidity providers. Oftentimes, liquidity would migrate to exchanges with higher fee brackets for higher returns, and yet Curve has the lowest fees and more liquidity locked than any other exchange. The project’s real secret is subsidizing liquidity with the CRV token, keeping yields high enough for liquidity providers to stay in its pools.  Curve now has almost $18.8 billion in TVL across seven different ecosystems, making it the second-largest decentralized application, or dapp, behind Aave and giving the project 11.4% of Ethereum’s overall DeFi TVL. According to Curve’s release schedule, during the third quarter, about 113 million CRV tokens were released to the community. At the current price and TVL, that equates to a 12% annual percentage yield to stakers and liquidity providers, not accounting for swap fees and incentive programs from alternative chains like Polygon and Avalanche.  Providing such enormous liquidity rewards has given Curve the reputation of being the backbone of all DeFi yields. A jump in CRV price usually signals a “risk-on” DeFi market, with yields trickling down throughout the ecosystem.  Stablecoin swaps are not the only source of DeFi yield. Aave and Compound both offer relatively attractive returns on stablecoins and crypto assets for providing collateralized loans. However, the demand for swapping stables is an essential piece of arbitraging lending rates or moving capital between protocols and exchanges. Curve has established itself as a go-to player for large swaps and passive yield, as well as a testing ground for decentralized stablecoins like DAI or MIM, and tokenized assets like staked ether.  DeFi TVL hitting all-time highs most likely signals a growing hunger for yield. Large funds or high-net-worth individuals will use Curve, Yearn and Convex for non-volatile yields, making the “Curve Wars” as important as ever.",POSITIVE,CRV,BLOCKCHAIN | CRV | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Edward Oosterbaan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/03/a-look-into-curves-ecosystem-defis-centerpiece,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2af86952c34058a7927055f67c2d82687bc5952d-5290x3194.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396609,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT4Xbm,1635972659,CoinDesk Names Kevin Reynolds Editor-in-Chief,"No matter what views people hold about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, there’s no denying the general public has an insatiable appetite for news and information about this field.  That’s why CoinDesk is building the leading global media platform for a rapidly growing digital asset industry, one that will be a vital information resource for all those engaged in the transformation of the global financial system that it portends.  To take that mission to the next level, we’re promoting Kevin Reynolds to the newly reconstituted role of Editor-in-Chief, where he’ll oversee our news, long-form and professional editorial content. A journalist with decades of experience building and running global news teams in fast-moving, high-stress environments and with an entrepreneurial instinct for finding and addressing new markets and audiences, Kevin is the ideal person to lead CoinDesk’s editorial coverage of this important story. Prior to this promotion, Kevin was CoinDesk’s Global News Editor.  Before joining CoinDesk last year, Kevin was at Bloomberg News for over 23 years, where he started, scaled and ran First Word, a 250-person global news/analysis service for professional clients. By the time Reynolds left Bloomberg, First Word had grown to be the most successful news product in company history, getting more client views than the much-larger Bloomberg News and winning two CEO awards.  Kevin also started Bloomberg’s Speed Desk, which Joe Weisenthal cited in Business Insider as a “mindblowing operation” that sends flash headlines on breaking news from press releases, Securities and Exchange Commission filings, websites and other media, as well as Bloomberg’s assignment desk. He turned around two other operations and started numerous others, including the training program that all Bloomberg News hires worldwide are required to take. He shares a patent for a CMS he helped design and is a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps.  Kevin enjoys the continued support of Executive Editor Marc Hochstein and Deputy Global News Editor Zack Seward, leading a two-pronged editorial mission.  As Executive Editor, Marc is leading the development of CoinDesk’s soon-to-be named online magazine of ideas, which will focus on long-form stories, investigative pieces, people profiles, Op-Eds and research, providing a resource for those looking for deeper dives into the many contentious issues facing this industry. Under Marc’s leadership, the new magazine will set the agenda for how this highly disruptive technology is incorporated into society, addressing the many challenges it poses to regulators, engineers, business leaders and the general public.  A former Editor-in-Chief at American Banker with more than 25 years in journalism, and now a four-year CoinDesk veteran, Marc will also continue to exercise autonomous authority as Executive Editor for ethics and standards. Journalists covering this field have an obligation to do so in as fair and impartial manner as possible and to seek to hold business leaders and policymakers to account over their commitment to principles of open access and the common interest in a technology that should be considered a “public good.” We are blessed to have a journalist of Marc’s experience and integrity overseeing CoinDesk’s commitment to this.  Zack will take responsibility for managing the global news staff, leading CoinDesk’s daily news meeting and helping to shape our daily, around-the-clock coverage of news in the crypto and related industries. He joined CoinDesk three years ago from Technical.ly, where he was Editor-in-Chief.  These changes within the editorial department give me an opportunity, as well, to call out the talented, experienced leaders heading CoinDesk’s other content departments.  Joanne Po is CoinDesk’s Head of Multimedia and Executive Producer. Her career includes senior leadership roles at Fox Digital, The Wall Street Journal and CNBC.  Emily Parker, who leads CoinDesk’s international expansion, is a former editor at The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times and a former member of the Policy Planning Staff at the U.S. State Department. She is the author of “Now I Know Who My Comrades Are” and a co-founder of the Asia-based crypto startup LongHash.  Pete Pachal, a former technology editor from Mashable who has been CoinDesk’s Executive Editor for Operations and Strategy will now take on a cross-content department role as Chief of Staff.  With token prices at all-time highs amid an explosion of innovation in decentralized finance (DeFi) that’s challenging the incumbent financial system, and with the non-fungible token (NFT) zeitgeist pointing to a new digital economic model, we are at what might be described as as “crypto moment.” I’m proud to have brought together this A-list team of media professionals so that CoinDesk can capture and explain all of its exciting elements.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Michael J.

One key distinction has been decreased volatility expectation.  This metric, which shows the cryptocurrency’s expected price swings, did not spike when bitcoin’s price hit record highs in April and then in October, indicating that bitcoin may be evolving into a more mature investment asset.  Prior to 2021, bitcoin’s three-month implied volatility (IV) – investors’ expectation of how turbulent prices will be over the ensuing three months – spiked during both bull and bear runs, according to data from crypto data firm Skew. But this year, a similar spike only occurred when the market crashed in May.  “IV tends to go up when people are unsure of what’s going to happen in the future,” Patrick Chu, director of institutional sales and trading at institution-focused, over-the-counter desk Paradigm, said. An increase in IV reflects a market attitude “like ‘wow! how high will it go?!’”  The change coincides with a low realized volatility of bitcoin – bitcoin volatility that has already occurred, Chu also noted.  “The market feels very complacent,” Chu said. “The recent realized volatility has been grinding lower as bitcoin becomes more mature, so most [our] clients are also not in a rush to buy options (buy implied volatility) to express their trade views at the current time.”  As CoinDesk reported, buying implied volatility is one of the lesser-known uses for options trading, which is a bet on whether price swings will increase or decrease. Traders buy options (call/put) when volatility is relatively cheap and sell when it’s high.  Data from Skew shows that except for a trading volume spike on Oct. 15 due to excitement over the debut of the first U.S. bitcoin futures-based exchange-traded fund (ETF), bitcoin options volume remained relatively low in October – even when bitcoin hit an all-time high on Oct. 20.  “When the market is stuck in a familiar range, traders tend to lose interest,” Chu added.  But some analysts argue that bitcoin is at an earlier stage and remains more volatile than traditional stock and capital markets.  IV “may have stabilized but is still very high compared to the S&P [500], for instance,” Noelle Acheson, head of market insights at Genesis Global Trading, said. (Genesis is owned by Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)  Trader and analyst Alex Kruger told CoinDesk that bitcoin is still “far from” a traditional asset, adding that decreased IV could be due to more volatility sellers on the market.  Meanwhile, speculative trading interest appears to have shifted to ether, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.  Ether’s three-month implied volatility and its options trading volume have both elevated in recent days, according to Skew, as the cryptocurrency broke to a record high on Tuesday.  As CoinDesk reported, options traders have turned to long-term bullish bets on ether as some anticipate that an ether-based ETF product will likely follow the launch of the bitcoin futures-based ETFs approved in the U.S.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/03/lower-trading-volatility-in-2021-crypto-bull-runs-signals-maturing-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/83ca0452a847f0318b19609cc49be44118b43909-4800x3188.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42396613,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT4Xej,1635968814,JPMorgan Report Says CBDCs Can Save Firms $100B a Year in Cross-Border Costs,"A central bank digital currency (CBDC) network could save global corporations over $100 billion a year in transaction costs when it comes to cross-border payments.  So says a report published Wednesday by consulting firm Oliver Wyman and JPMorgan called “Unlocking $120 Billion Value in Cross-Border Payments.”  The report estimates that of the nearly $24 trillion in wholesale payments that move across borders each year, banks incur more than $120 billion in total transaction costs; this excludes potential hidden costs in trapped liquidity and delayed settlements.  “The case for CBDCs to address pain points in cross-border payments is very compelling,” said Jason Ekberg, an Oliver Wyman partner, in a statement. “The bulk of today’s wholesale cross-border payments process remains sub-optimal due to multiple intermediaries between the sending and receiving banks, often resulting in high transaction costs, long settlement times, and lack of transparency on the status of the payments.”  Conversations around CBDCs, driven by the march of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, can be about either retail issuance or the type of wholesale transactions that are the focus on the report.  Read more: France Tests CBDC Flows With Singapore Using Automated Liquidity Pool  There have been several wholesale banking initiatives in recent years led by private companies, commercial banks and central banks, the report points out, but nothing like a full-scale, multiple central bank digital currency (mCBDC) network.  As an example, the report uses the ASEAN region and its corridors, comprising Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, which operates across a diverse set of 10 currencies and contributes 7% of global cross-border trade.  JPMorgan and Oliver Wyman suggest a model for the ideal mCBDC that considers the process from minting and redeeming of CBDCs to foreign exchange conversion and settlement.

Faze, a startup that creates digital collectibles, also announced its partnership with the International Cricket Council (ICC) to launch a cricket non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace on the Flow blockchain, where NBA Top Shot captured mainstream attention earlier this year.  Faze CEO Anshum Bhambri said in a press release he hopes to use the partnership “to build the metaverse for cricket.”  Flow builder Dapper Labs, major Dapper backer Coatue, Sequoia Capital India, Samsung Next, Courtside Ventures and Sacramento Kings owner Vivek Ranadive also invested in the round.  Faze’s cricket marketplace will mimic Top Shot’s use of present-day and historical moments in the sport, the company said in a press release. It also plans to build a “play-to-earn universe” involving the “battling of NFTs.”  It’s not the first cricket NFT platform to hit the market. Polygon-based Rario launched in August with a pair of cricket leagues signed on.  Through an earlier project, Round Labs, Bhambri appears to have rolled out a different cricket related NFT project, but on the Ethereum blockchain.  “We’re excited to be partnering with Faze to launch the ultimate cricket fan experience with the ICC on Flow,” Dapper Labs CEO Roham Gharegozlou said in a press release. “With over one billion cricket fans across ICC’s 105 member nations, Faze is revolutionizing how cricket fans everywhere connect and engage with some of the greatest moments in cricket history.”  Dapper Labs announced a $250 million funding round in September at a $7.6 billion valuation.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | SPONSORED | FLOW,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/03/international-cricket-nfts-to-hit-flow-blockchain-following-17m-seed-round,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2ed8a7abb322f08debe63de0b387b62866901c01-4165x3124.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396632,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT4ZF7,1635968509,EOS Foundation CEO: ‘EOS as It Stands Is a Failure’,"At a virtual event on Wednesday, EOS Foundation CEO Yves La Rose claimed that “EOS as it stands is a failure,” according to a transcript of prepared remarks viewed by CoinDesk.  In the speech, Rose weighed in on the past and future of the EOS blockchain protocol, saying that the project’s native currency, EOS, has been “a terrible investment.”  The speech places much of the blame on backer and former developer Block.one, and says that the EOS Foundation is set to step up, as the project can “no longer rely on” the Cayman Islands-based blockchain software company for guidance.  The remarks also lay out a path forward for the project that includes forming new core teams, creating and distributing grants programs and developing a roadmap guided by “four pillars” of new products.  Victim of its own success  Rose’s speech argues that the listless current state of EOS is due in part to the fanfare of its inception. EOS famously raised $4.1 billion in 2018 in an unprecedented initial coin offering (ICO) held over the course of a year.  Read more: The First Yearlong ICO for EOS Raised $4 Billion. The Second? Just $2.8 Million  “It’s very clear to me that EOS was a victim of its own success,” La Rose said, according to the prepared remarks. “The token sale for EOS shattered and broke all previous records in terms of funds raised. This put EOS in a position of having to meet extreme expectations as it raised extreme sums.”  However, the speech then places the blame on Block.one, going so far as to allege potential crimes.  “At this point, it is the consensus of the majority of token holders that I speak to, inside and outside of EOS, that Block.one knowingly misrepresented their capabilities and this amounts to negligence and fraud,” La Rose wrote.  The speech argues that the EOS Foundation could replace Block.one as a guiding organization, which will free the project to expand. La Rose spun up the foundation in August after stepping down in May as the CEO of EOS Nation, an infrastructure provider for the protocol.  “What we are experiencing is a shift whereby the EOS community is placing itself in a position to be able to move away from Block.one, essentially forking them out. Until this formal shift occurs Block.one will simply continue weighing EOS down,” La Rose wrote.  CoinDesk has reached out to Block.one for comment.  Block.one CEO Brendan Blumer mentioned the EOS Foundation in a supportive tweet last month:  Block.one has recently shifted its focus to the development of Bullish, a crypto exchange with Wall Street backing that is partially built on the EOS blockchain. The exchange, which is still pre-launch, announced in July that it was going public in a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) deal valued at $9 billion.  Read more: Bullish Set for Public Listing Through $9B Merger With Ex-NYSE President’s SPAC  ‘Four pillars’  In his speech, La Rose said he hopes the fairly new EOS Foundation will be able to take narrative and branding control over the project in order to counteract the disarray of decentralization.  “Our issue has not been decentralization, but the lack of centralization. A centralized entity that could support the ecosystem in a way that only a centralized entity could,” the transcript reads.  He then proposed four “pillars” that will guide the project forward. Each pillar – branded Audit+, Wallet+, Docu+ and API+ – currently has a working group, and each will produce a “blue paper” that will collectively serve as a road map for the project moving forward, with a target publication date “prior to the upcoming Chinese New Year.”  New investment  La Rose claims the project has been approached by venture capital firms looking to deploy upwards of “$150-$200 million” in the ecosystem, and that the EOS Foundation is prepared to help deploy that capital after overseeing $7 million in grants.  The speech then ends with La Rose staking a definitive claim to leadership over the project.  “I’m not here to be liked, I’m here to do a job. What we’ve been lacking in EOS is leadership. Somebody who will lead by example and show up every single day working towards greatness for us all,” La Rose concludes, echoing one of his recent tweets.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/11/03/eos-foundation-ceo-eos-as-it-stands-is-a-failure,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/28825ed78bac9fafedee93fb6672ebbfb36644b7-4607x3463.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The letter questioned why the SEC is comfortable with allowing a derivatives-based bitcoin ETF but not a bitcoin spot ETF. It referred to the launch of the first bitcoin futures ETF in U.S., which started trading in October.  Emmer and Soto wrote that bitcoin spot ETFs are based directly on the asset and offer investors more protection than one based on derivatives.  “To be clear, we do not intend to say that one method of exposure is better than the other, but rather that unless there are clear and demonstrable investor protection advantages, investors should have a choice over which product is most suitable for them and their investment objectives,” the lawmakers wrote.

The Fear And Greed Index Says The Bitcoin Market Is Still Greedy As per the latest weekly report from Arcane Research, the fear and greed index has been pointing towards greed since almost a month now. The &apos;fear and greed index&apos; is an indicator that shows what the general sentiment is among investors in the Bitcoin market. The metric uses a numeric scale that goes from zero to hundred, with values below fifty signaling a fear sentiment, while values above 50 implying a greedy sentiment in the market. Values close to the extremities, that is, below 25 and above 75, indicate extreme fear and extreme greed, respectively. Usually, fear values are seen when the Bitcoin price is showing a declining trend, while greed values are seen during upwards movement. The extreme values imply investors are either overly bearish (in case of extreme fear) or overly bullish (for extreme greed) about the crypto&apos;s future. Such points can therefore lead to a reversal in the price. For this reason, some traders tend to consider periods of extreme fear as good buying points, and that of extreme greed as selling points.

The demand for insurance has grown by more than 130 percent over the last decade and is now a staggering $5.5 trillion industry. With new businesses and opportunities coming to life, the demand is unlikely to cease. Likewise, one industry where the demand for insurance is growing at a rapid pace is crypto and DeFi.

42394382,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvck7F,1635960658,The Cube Movement,"The mainstream media has caught on to the latest huge crypto trend, which isn’t a new non-fungible token (NFT) line or a fresh dog token, but small desk tchotchkes made of one of the densest elements humans can safely touch – tungsten. Spearheaded by Neeraj Agrawal at CoinCenter and investor Nic Carter, the Cube Movement has surged through Crypto Twitter over the last month or so. Midwest Tungsten – the true Cube connoisseur’s American supplier of choice – has seen massive sales spikes. Twitter users have reported wait times of more than a month for new Cube orders.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Yesterday, NBC did its take on the “Tungsten Cube Bull Market” and offered a few tentative insights into the big question: Why are people into these things?  It started off as another Crypto Twitter meme obliquely commenting on speculative manias, but has become A Thing for literally material reasons: The cubes are so weirdly heavy that holding one feels like a kind of tactile illusion. To my shame, I do not own a Cube, but I have experienced its inscrutable allure, the almost supernatural sense that something so dense must be in some unspeakable way alive, an aliveness beyond the horizon of our petty human concerns. As Tim Copeland at The Block perfectly phrased it, when you hold a Cube, you sense that “it yearns to be one again with the earth.”  The Tungsten Cube is basically a Magic Eye poster for your hands, in other words. But, at the risk of taking all the fun out of it (which, OK, I guess is my job), the Cube phenomenon is deeply layered and has a bizarrely large amount to tell us about not just crypto, but where we are as a society.  The Cube is about Zoom and the coronavirus pandemic. The Cube is about market froth. The Cube is about the metaverse. The Cube is about income inequality.  One level up from the pure sensation of its weird density, the Cube is a digital-age reminder that we have bodies and that those bodies really, really, really matter. In purely hedonistic terms, holding The Cube is just an extreme version of the experiences that await you every minute of every day if you just get up from your desk for a little while and go take a walk or, better yet, head into the woods and take a hike.  Sure, the Cube is cool, but have you ever picked up a random good-looking rock from the side of a river? Have you ever overheard a really interesting conversation when walking to the corner store? The Cube’s weight is a memory and reminder of the rich reality that’s out there for the taking the second we log off. The Cube is a symptom of our Plague Years, embraced by a professional class that has been isolated behind screens and has had enough. (It should also, as a purely frivolous luxury good, be a reminder of all the GrubHub drivers and “essential workers” whose physical risk and discomfort the work-from-home cohort has been able to conveniently hide behind app screens.)  The Cube is also a righteous middle finger to the wave of metaverse pitches coming fast and furious from the likes of the former Facebook and now Microsoft. The Cube rebuts the absurd idea that virtual reality is going to replace playing ping-pong or fencing in real life. Both of those were featured in Facebook’s Meta presentation and (to return to Earth from the realm of poets) they are gobsmackingly stupid pitches. The kind of haptic feedback and low latency needed to have even a reasonable approximation of these visceral experiences in a virtual world are decades, if not centuries, away. Using them as examples is probably the clearest evidence that Mark Zuckerberg’s “Meta” is essentially a con meant to sell a bill of goods that will never truly arrive.  It might seem equally absurd to claim this rhetorical weight for a meme emerging from Crypto Twitter, which is almost as full of terminally online brain-poisoning victims as Politics Twitter. But as I’ve explored at length in my book “Bitcoin is Magic”, the deep purpose of crypto and blockchain is to imbue digital objects with the permanence of the physical world – to give them, if you’ll indulge me, digital density.  The Canadian media philosopher Marshall McLuhan analyzed the history of media in terms of a tradeoff between enduring communication technology (e.g., the Pyramids) and high-speed communication technology (e.g., email). Bitcoin and crypto are a novel melding of the durable and the fast. The technology’s costs and inconveniences (I’m looking at you, gas fees) are not a bug, but a feature inextricable from this ambition.  Yes, OK, at the end of the day there’s no denying that Tungsten Cube Mania is mostly just another fad, fueled by the newly crypto-rich who can splash out two hundred bucks or more for a 21st century Hummel figurine. But as with any fad with real legs, if you look a bit deeper you’ll find a weighty truth within.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,David Z.

The voted-in proposal could bring greater efficiency and utility by deploying a longtime staple of the decentralized finance (DeFi) world.  Stellar is a blockchain protocol designed to facilitate cross-border payments between different forms of tokenized money, such as digital dollars and tokenized gold. Until today, the protocol operated with an orderbook-style matching engine, connecting buyers and sellers of various tokens.  AMMs are a decentralized form of exchange pooling two assets, such as ETH and DAI, which automatically adjusts the price relationship between the assets based on trading volume. They are a particularly popular form of asset exchange in DeFi.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Stellar’s head of ecosystem, Justin Rice, said that the addition of an AMM at the protocol level was a popular ask among developers and users, and that the implementation takes cues from Ethereum-native AMMs such as Uniswap v2.  Users will now be able to deposit liquidity into pools for trading fees, and the implementation could prove to be a boon for market makers and arbitrageurs trading between prices on the order book and the AMM.  Additionally, Rice said that this integration will make adding new assets to the protocol easier, as AMMs allow long-tail or exotic assets to trade despite limited liquidity.

Like bitcoin, its mining revenue had been affected by the crackdown. However, ETH did not suffer as much as bitcoin did from this move. Hence, miners of the asset have seen good returns on their activity. The difference has been evident in the mining revenue between bitcoin and ethereum miners. Ethereum Outpaces Bitcoin Mining Mining revenues between Ethereum and bitcoin mining show a discrepancy in their figures. For one, Ethereum miners have definitely had the more profitable year out of the two. Although not a very wide gap, it is still a notable difference in the returns from both assets. While ETH miners saw a total of $17 billion in revenue from their mining activities, bitcoin miners only saw $13.6 billion.

The San Francisco-based crypto exchange tweeted on Monday that Brian Hoffman, its crypto platform product lead, said Kraken would list shiba inu on Tuesday if the tweet received 2,000 “likes.” At press time, the tweet had received more than 77,000 “likes.”  However, as of Wednesday, SHIB is still not available to buy and sell on Kraken, and in a follow-up tweet, the exchange wrote that while they’ve heard SHIB’s supporters “loud and clear,” there is “more work” for them to do as they move through their listing review process. Kraken did not further clarify when or if it would list SHIB.  When reached for comment, Kraken said it had nothing to add beyond what it had already tweeted.  The event has triggered plenty of anger on social media, with Twitter user @Rogersnith10 tweeting: “Don’t tweet false promises in future it really doesn’t give any investors confidence in your platform, you have lost me as lifetime customer now.” The tweet has received almost 1,400 “likes.”  While SHIB’s trading volume is mostly concentrated on decentralized finance (DeFi) trading, it has been extremely popular among retail investors on major centralized exchanges. At the time of writing, Binance, Coinbase and OKEx are the top three exchanges with the most SHIB trading volume, according to CoinGecko.  SHIB was recently changing hands at $0.00006433, down 6.5% in the past 24 hours.

42396642,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT4ZMz,1635955010,"Ether Hits Fresh Record High, Sandbox’s SAND Leads Rally in Metaverse Coins","Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum’s blockchain, refreshed record highs on Tuesday amid continued bullish flows in the options market. Meanwhile, tokens associated with virtual reality games extended their rally on Facebook’s recent championing of the metaverse as the next evolution of social technology.  Ether rose to $4,480 during the European hours, surpassing the previous peak price of $4,458 reached on Oct. 29, according to CoinDesk 20 data.  On Monday, several large bull call spreads crossed the tape on Deribit, the world’s largest crypto options exchange by volume and open interest.  As seen in the chart, a bull call spread involves purchasing a call at a particular strike price and simultaneously taking an opposite position in a higher strike call. The strategy is initiated when a measured rise in a cryptocurrency’s price is expected.  Traders have been snapping up $10,000 and $15,000 calls expiring in March 2022 of late, with Goldman Sachs reportedly predicting an $8,000 ETH price before the year’s end.  “Since mid-October, we have seen higher interest in year-end and March upside ETH exposure,” Deribit’s Institutional Newsletter for October said.  “Premiums for downward protection are getting cheaper. A drop in 3 or 6 Month Skew indicates that out-of-the-money calls are getting more expensive than the money puts. A similar effect can be seen in the volatility term structure where Dec. and March IVs [implied volatilities] are elevated,” Deribit added.  SAND tops $3  Ethereum-based virtual reality platform The Sandbox’s SAND token tapped record highs above $3, taking the seven-day gain to over 300%. Other gaming tokens like enjin coin (ENJ) and lluvium’s ILV token also traded higher.  “The growing investor attention on the potential of the metaverse, helped by Facebook’s announcement (SAND and MANA are much more direct ways to bet on metaverse growth than is an investment in Facebook stock),” Noelle Acheson, head of market insights Genesis Global Trading, said.  “Facebook’s recent decision to rebrand as Meta is powering metaverse, non-fungible tokens and gaming tokens higher. AXS, ILV, WILD – all have hit lifetime highs, MANA, SAND, have tripled,” Dennis Hui, a DeFi portfolio manager at DAO Ventures, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  According to Anthony Vince, global head of trading at GSR, The Sandbox’s latest closure of a $93 million Series B funding round led by SoftBank adds to bullish momentum around the cryptocurrency.  “This should help catapult their growth plans in the metaverse and NFT space, which is a focus of forward-thinking crypto investors at the moment,” Vince said of The Sandbox.",POSITIVE,ENJ | ETH | SAND,BUSINESS | ENJ | ETH | SAND | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/02/ether-hits-fresh-record-high-sandboxs-sand-leads-rally-in-metaverse-coins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dd1e568902145050886badbc951236153cbd2673-1080x880.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42396640,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT4ZNy,1635954928,"Loopring Surges 40%, Solana Replaces Cardano as 5th-Largest Coin as Ethereum Fees Spike","Rising costs on Ethereum, the world’s largest smart-contract blockchain, appear to be driving investors to coins associated with layer 2 products facilitating faster and cheaper transactions and rival programmable blockchains.  The average fee on Ethereum, known as gas, has risen by a staggering 2,300% since late June. It has more than doubled to $56 in the past two weeks alone, according to data provided by the blockchain analytics firm Glassnode, and the seven-day moving average of the mean transaction fee has hit a record high of $52.  Surging costs are drawing the ire of the investor community and forcing the retail crowd to search for relatively cheaper options like layer 2 protocol Loopring and rivals Solana and polkadot.  “Ethereum is a beast (ETH bull here) which is the future of cryptocurrency – but the gas fees really can affect us,” a Redditor complained in a blog post published Tuesday, explaining the rationale behind purchasing Loopring. “We are tired of paying $150+ in gas fees just to transfer or buy $100 worth of a cryptocurrency.”  CoinDesk data show LRC, the native token of Loopring, a layer 2 scaling protocol for Ethereum-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs), has increased 243% from $0.42 to $1.44 in the past seven days, with the price surging by nearly 40% over 24 hours. Rumors that video game store GameStop may team up with Loopring for a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace could be adding fuel to LRC’s price rally.  Programmable blockchain Solana’s SOL token has risen by 13% in the past 24 hours to a record high of $234. The cryptocurrency has gained 25% in the past seven days, pushing Solana’s market capitalization to $70 billion – the fifth-largest globally and ahead of another Ethereum rival Cardano’s $67 billion, CoinGecko data show.  According to Messari’s Mason Nystrom, Solana is also expanding its footprint into Ethereum-dominant crypto market sub-sectors like NFTs.  “As the Solana ecosystem continues to expand, NFTs on Solana have similarly witnessed formidable growth as a category,” Nystrom said in a blog post published Wednesday. “Total NFT secondary sales volume on Solana has officially reached $500 million.”  Smart-contract blockchain Polkadot’s DOT token also rallied to an all-time high, touching $53.37 early today and surpassing the previous peak of $49.74 reached in May.  Most coins linked to smart-contract blockchains have outperformed ether in the past 24 hours. Ether was trading near $4,600 at press time, representing a 3.5% gain.  According to Delphi Digital, a continued rise in Ethereum’s transaction fees would crowd out retail investors, leading to a drop in network usage and the cryptocurrency’s price.  “It is critical that Ethereum scaling solutions like StarkNet, zkSync, Arbitrum and Optimism gain traction soon, otherwise steep transaction costs will increase activity on alternate L1s such as Solana, Avalanche, Fantom and Polygon (to name a few),” analysts at Delphi Digital said in the market updated published Tuesday.",POSITIVE,ETH | LRC | SOL,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | LRC | SOL,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/03/loopring-surges-40-solana-replaces-cardano-as-5th-largest-coin-as-ethereum-fees-spike,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c4237331ee1cb5f2731a300d568e6a096267da73-1800x1013.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Castle Rock, Colorado-based miner cited a recently completed $54 million purchase order for 9,000 S19j Pro miners with Bitmain for the increase in its forecast. The mining computers are expected to be delivered and deployed from May through October 2022.  Riot also said that the increase in its hashrate guidance doesn’t include any potential benefits from its 200 megawatt immersion-cooled technology, which is expected to increase the mining power of its existing computers.  In October, Riot produced 464 bitcoins, which is about a 433% year-over-year increase.  Riot said its total year-to-date, self-mined bitcoin production is 2,921, compared to 2,457 bitcoin as of September, which is an increase of 464 bitcoins, implying it is continuing to “hodl” the coins it mined this year.  The bitcoin miner said its current hashrate capacity is 2.8 EH/s, which is about 1.6% of the Bitcoin network’s total hashrate of 170.9 EH/s as of Nov. 2, according to data analytics firm Glassnode.

The celebration comes as Huobi’s cryptocurrency exchange winds down operations in mainland China after a government crypto ban.  In the flagship campaign for the anniversary, Huobi will offer one winner a trip to the “outer perimeters of Earth.” The company says the contest is open to all Huobi Global users.  Huobi didn’t specify the name of the company that would facilitate the space trip. Virgin Galactic, Blue Origin and SpaceX are companies that are leading the race to put paying passengers in space. Last month, Huobi sent two crypto experts to the environment-focused Oceans 4.4 retreat in the British Virgin Islands at the home of Virgin Galactic founder Richard Branson.  Back on Earth, Huobi will host its annual online industry forum on Nov. 8, which features panels with economists, government officials and crypto business leaders. The list of speakers this year includes former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.  Global expansion will be a unifying theme to the anniversary celebration in the wake of China’s crypto ban. Huobi stopped accepting new user registrations in mainland China in late September. The company will gradually retire existing accounts by the end of the year.  Huobi Global has said it already derives 70% of its overall revenue outside of China, and its global expansion has targeted emerging markets such as Turkey, Brazil and Indonesia. Huobi gauges expansion success in terms of user growth and said it has started seeing strength in new markets it’s entering.  “In terms of user growth, we’re seeing increasing activity across Southeast Asia and the CIS [Commonwealth of Independent States] region. We only recently launched operations in Latin America, but the region is also showing a lot of promise,” Jeff Mei, Director of Global Strategy at Huobi Group, told CoinDesk.  Huobi continues to work toward its goal of increasing its global headcount to 3,000 by the end of the year, up from 2,300 in early October.  “We’re continuing to ramp up our global talent acquisition efforts but it’s also critical that we find the right people in each market. We’ve made some progress, but it’s still too early to say where we’ll land by the end of the year,” said Mei.

42410960,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtkCf,1635939000,Looking Into Ethereum’s Economic Future,"This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum 2.0 and its sweeping impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to Valid Points here.  While weeks and months in crypto often feel like years, it has only been 60 days since the hard fork that contained EIP 1559 was implemented on Ethereum’s mainnet. A world of data regarding EIP 1559 has surfaced, but ultimately the upgrade is still in its infancy.  In fact, a few weeks ago, I wrote about Nic Carter’s somewhat overly eager Ethereum takeaways and how it was probably too early to estimate EIP 1559′s impact on the network. However, this week I am changing my tone a bit and looking at the potential implications of the upgrade’s base fee burn and its effect on the longevity of Ethereum.  At a very high level, under proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS), Ethereum uses block rewards to incentivize miners and validators of the chain. This incentive helps properly secure the network by paying those that are beneficial for confirming transactions and logging the state of the chain, which in turn encourages competition to grow a large and distributed base of miners/validators.  Reward issuance: Bitcoin vs. Ethereum  Bitcoin uses a similar model, but every four years the amount paid in block rewards decreases until the reward is extremely negligible and the bitcoin supply tops at 21 million. As block rewards become negligible, bitcoin miners will be forced to rely on transaction fees in order to remain profitable. Reasonably, the network will have to maintain a level of activity high enough to pay miners for their services.  Ethereum and EIP 1559, on the other hand, now take a reverse approach to Bitcoin’s security budget. EIP 1559 took away the vast majority of transaction fee revenue that miners previously received, but Ethereum will continue to emit block rewards to miners (and eventually validators), indefinitely. While Ethereum takes an uncapped supply approach, the newly introduced fee burn will help counteract ether’s inflation.  Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against inflation has certainly been a huge part of the asset’s success. However, its “digital gold” narrative leads to lower network activity as the asset is considered a store of value rather than a medium of exchange, at least for the time being. This issue has left some wondering if transaction fees will be enough to keep miners interested, if miners will adapt or if the network will have to pivot to an updated compensation model.  It’s likely wrong to say that EIP 1559 “solved” this issue of paying miners into perpetuity, because again bitcoin’s fixed supply is what makes investing in the asset so attractive. Ether’s supply, on the other hand, will be extremely dependent on network activity and the demand for blockspace. The Bitcoin network is years away from the concern becoming a reality and will likely surprise me with its ability to adapt and survive.  My comparison between the two networks is strictly how they approach miner incentives, something I believe EIP 1559 possibly addressed with its fee burn mechanism. A future in which Ethereum can continue to subsidize validators without diluting those that hold ether is very promising for the network.  Pulse check  The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain over the past week. For more information about the metrics featured in this section, check out our 101 explainer on Eth 2.0 metrics.  Disclaimer: All profits made from CoinDesk’s Eth 2.0 staking venture will be donated to a charity of the company’s choosing once transfers are enabled on the network.  Validated takes  The Altair upgrade shifted validator rewards toward newly created “sync committees” of 512 randomly selected validators. BACKGROUND: Sync committees are responsible for providing support for light clients and signing the newest block header. The odds of a validator getting chosen to the committee are currently 1/489 and attestation rewards/penalties are amplified for the 24-hour period that they are part of the sync committee.  A CryptoPunk NFT appeared to sell for $530 million after an on-chain transaction caused price bot alerts last Thursday. BACKGROUND: While CryptoPunks have sold for as much as 4,200 ETH in the past, the fake sale would have been the largest by orders of magnitude. It appears the owner used a flash loan to make the fake purchase of the Punk, borrowing and repaying 124k ETH. The move was likely a marketing stunt.  Cream Finance was exploited by a flash loan for over $260 million in depositor assets. BACKGROUND: Cream is a prominent peer-to-peer decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform with a history of exploits. The flash loan manipulated the price of Cream’s faulty collateral “yUSD,” making the price artificially high and allowing the exploiter significant borrowing power. The exploiters showed significant DeFi knowledge, maximizing the return of their loot and hiding their tracks with the Ren Bitcoin bridge.  Aave was rumored to be susceptible to an exploit similar to the one that targeted Cream, prompting Justin Sun to remove over $4 million in collateral. BACKGROUND: A vulnerability with xSushi collateral scared Aave depositors and led to a ~20% decrease in total value locked (TVL). The governance process held the team back from making an immediate fix and the bug is still exploitable as of today. The Aave team’s analysis showed that the manipulation would not be profitable for a hacker.

42396638,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT4ZK2,1635923410,Group of Exchanges Call on Indian Government to Regulate Crypto in Front-Page Ad,"CORRECTION (Nov. 3, 16:57 UTC): Corrects to make clear that the source of the piece was a front-page ad in the Economic Times and not a news article.  A group of cryptocurrency exchanges and trade groups took out an ad taking up the entire front page of one of India’s top finance newspapers, calling on the government to provide regulatory guidance to the crypto industry.  At the same time, the exchanges, which include WazirX, ZebPay, CoinDCX, CoinSwitch Kuber and others, committed in the ad in The Economic Times to complying with the Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Committee of India’s (BACC) self-regulatory code of conduct under the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI).  The main features of the code include online know-your-customer (KYC) verification of all customers, checking for fraud, investor education, an audit trail of all transactions, grievance redressal and full compliance with law enforcement and tax authorities.  The Indian government has been sitting on a crypto regulation bill for at least a year. Meanwhile, since the Supreme Court lifted the Reserve Bank of India’s two-year banking ban on crypto exchanges in March 2020, investment in crypto has soared.  Initially, it looked like the Indian government would once again look to ban crypto but recently it’s been reported that the legislation would regulate crypto as an asset class like commodities. It’s likely the exchanges are hoping that their ad adds momentum to that movement.  Tens of millions of Indians have invested $80 billion (INR 6 trillion) in crypto, according to the ad. Given these “staggering” numbers and “massive” growth potential, India needs a “transparent and regulated environment,” the group said in the ad.  “The huge amount of Indian investor exposure to cryptocurrencies warrants quick action by the government on the regulatory front,” Prasad Rane, partner at Legaligence Strategic Consulting LLP, told CoinDesk.  “The global anti-money laundering agency the Financial Action Task Force [FATF] has already identified crypto assets as a source of risk and recently published guidance to regulate the industry like banks,” Rane said. “Our government is behind the curve.”  Indian investment in crypto has ballooned to $6.6 billion this year from $923 million last year, intelligence firm Chainalysis found in July.

42396633,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT4ZG6,1635920766,Bitcoin Whale Holdings Reach 2021 High Amid Inflation Fears,"Bitcoin whales, or large investors with ample capital supply, appear to be buying again as fears of inflation lurching out of control strengthen the case for investing in store of value assets.  Large investors holding at least 1,000 BTC snapped up 142,000 coins last week, taking the cumulative tally to nearly 200,000 BTC - the highest in 2021, according to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis’s market intel report published Tuesday.  The renewed buying amid rising inflation expectations across the globe suggests investment is the primary use case for bitcoin.  “Its a confirmation of the view that bitcoin is seen as digital gold, or perhaps institutions are just making a longer term trade on the bitcoin price,” Chainalysis said.  The U.S. 10-year breakeven rate, which represents how the market foresees long-term price pressures, recently rose to a decade high of 2.64%, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Bitcoin rallied nearly 40% in October, hitting a record high of $66,975.  Analysts at JPMorgan have attributed the rally to the perception that bitcoin is an inflation hedge contrary. The perception stems from bitcoin’s mining reward halving. This programmed code reduces the pace of supply expansion by 50% every four years, putting the cryptocurrency’s monetary policy at odds with the Federal Reserve’s decades of money printing.  However, bitcoin needs to expand its footprint into crypto sub-sectors like Web 3 and decentralized finance to remain relevant relative to ether in the long run, according to Chainalysis.  “Bitcoin usage has not reached the sophistication of Ethereum or other layer 1 assets,” Chainalysis said. “A decentralized way of wrapping bitcoin is needed to unlock the use of bitcoin as high-quality capital in DeFi.”  “If bitcoin can be used as capital in Web 3.0 then it will have a future as both a scarce fungible asset and as a useful asset in the more innovative side of crypto,” Chainalysis added.  The uptick in whale holdings suggests the recent rally is backed by strong hands and is sustainable. Bitcoin’s bullish momentum lost steam in the first quarter as whale holdings started declining. The market crashed in May.  The cryptocurrency was last changing hands near $62,900, representing a 0.5% drop on the day, according to CoinDesk 20 data.

Naturally, this move is shining a spotlight on the metaverse industry, or the field of virtual worlds. While this concept has more recently become a viral phenomenon, it&apos;s not a new idea at all. The metaverse began as a science-fiction concept that was first introduced in the 1990s by sci-fi writer Neal Stephenson in his famous book, Snow Crash. Stephenson imagined networks of virtual worlds where people could experience all the benefits of modern technology—without the hassles of physical travel. But it wasn&apos;t until Facebook&apos;s purchase of Oculus that virtual reality (VR) became somewhat mainstream. Achieving true immersion with VR is still an arduous task, but Facebook is making steady progress toward its goal of having a viable business selling VR headsets to the masses. Innovate or Die Since Facebook&apos;s acquisition of Oculus and re-branding to Meta, the metaverse has become more than just a sci-fi concept. It&apos;s fast becoming a new playing field for businesses. In other words, businesses can no longer ignore the metaverse industry; they need to innovate or get left behind.

However, she did not give any indication of the regulator’s decisions on ETFs.  The SFC is currently reviewing its regulatory regime for crypto to see if it is still “fit for purpose,” Leung said.  Under the regime, virtual asset service providers have to be licensed to operate in Hong Kong and can only offer services to professional investors, defined as individuals with a portfolio of over HK$8 million (US$1 million) or companies with more than $5 million in total assets. SFC-regulated fund managers can invest up to 10% of their gross asset value in crypto, and can apply for a special license if they wish to invest more.
