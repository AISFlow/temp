That's down considerably since the firm's August 2018 filing, which showed $967.8 million in assets under management. That's a loss in value of $376.4 million.  The Wall Street Journal was the first to report that the company was no longer a billion-dollar operation.  Polychain is one of the most elite funds serving startups in the crypto industry. Founded by Olaf Carlson-Wee, the first employee of Coinbase, Polychain was among the earliest funds to invest in tokens rather than companies, as CoinDesk reported in 2016.  Part two  of the most recent form describes the company as managing five funds: Polychain Master Fund, Polychain Master Fund II, Polychain Ventures, Dfinity Ecosystem Fund and Polychain Opportunities Fund I.  The document acknowledges significant risks in investing in crypto assets, writing:  ""There is no assurance that digital assets will maintain their long-term value in terms of purchasing power in the future, or that acceptance of digital asset payments by mainstream retail merchants and commercial businesses will grow.""

42430366,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsBJh,1555014664,Crypto Exchange Bithumb Posts $180 Million Loss for 2018,"Bithumb, South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has posted a net loss of 205.5 billion won ($180 million) for 2018.  CoinDesk Korea reported the news on Thursday, saying that the loss was mainly due to a sharp decline in the cryptocurrency market last year, though the company's operator BTCKorea also cited infrastructure investments and labor costs as factors.  The figure marks a big swing into the red for Bithumb, having recorded a net profit of 534.9 billion won ($469 million) in 2017.  The exchange’s revenues, on the other hand, grew around 17.5 percent to 391.7 billion won ($343.4 million) in 2018, compared to 333.4 billion won ($292.3 million) the year prior.  The figures also show that the exchange's operating profit declined 3.4 percent to 256.1 billion won ($224.5 million) last year from 265.1 billion won ($232.5 million) in 2017.  Meanwhile, operating expenses rose from 68.3 billion won ($59.8 million) to 135.6 billion won ($119 million), while non-operating expenses increased sharply from 4.1 billion ($3.6 million) won to 381.9 billion won ($334.8 million).  Bithumb has been going through some tough times. Just two weeks ago, the exchange suffered its latest hack, losing around $13 million in the EOS cryptocurrency and about $6.2 million in XRP. Last year, Bithumb was also hacked for some $30 million-worth of cryptocurrencies, but later claimed to have retrieved $14 million-worth of the hacked funds.  Since the latest theft, Bithumb has disclosed that it holds all customers's assets in cold (offline) wallets to prevent losses through such attacks.  Amid its financial issues, Bithumb, said last month that it plans to cut its staffing levels by up to 50 percent, from 310 employees to around 150.

42430382,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsBph,1555009807,MakerDAO to Increase Fees Above 10% in Bid to Stabilize DAI Stablecoin,"UPDATE: MakerDAO token holders have now voted to increase the DAI Stability Fee to 11.5 percent.    ________    Investors who hold tokens in the programmatic lending protocol MakerDAO appear likely to approve a fifth fee increase that would further raise the cost of platform's US dollar-backed stablecoin DAI.  Since Monday, five different options have been presented to MakerDAO token holders, all of which suggested different possible increases to the platform's ""stability fee,"" the most extreme being a 4 percent increase. This preliminary round of polling has now ended and token holders look set to ratify that change in a final executive vote.  Once ratified, the 11.5 percent stability fee will make it more expensive for users to take out programmatic loans of DAI by locking up ether as collateral.  The aim is to reduce the amount of DAI in the markets and push up the stablecoin's value, which currently hovers at $0.96, a figure that's below the stable $1 price developers and users want to achieve.  As noted by MakerDAO Foundation risk management lead Cyrus Younessi during a public call Thursday:  ""The DAI peg has continued to be weak this past week, pretty much as weak as it has ever been, hovering around 96 cents. DAI supply started to trend back up as the ETH price continued to go upward. [There is] lots of borrowing and lots of weakness in the DAI price.""  The news comes despite a 4 percent fee hike executed just last month and three other, smaller increases that have been approved and implemented to the code since February.  Reducing DAI supply  Yet, with all increases having proved ineffective in stabilizing the DAI peg, some users are now calling for a different approach to reducing circulating DAI supply.  ""At some point soon, it may make sense to lay off the [stability fee] hikes and rely on the 100 million supply cap to restore order,"" writes Ryan Sean Adams, founder of crypto asset investment company MythosCapital, on Reddit.  This suggestion to change the hard supply cap of 100 million DAI was also raised as a point of discussion in today's MakerDAO governance and risk call.  ""I'd say if we don't see an improvement in the DAI price by next week we consider reducing the debt ceiling in addition to a [stability fee] raise,"" wrote Matthew Light in the call chatroom.  Currently, only 100 million DAI can be loaned out to users in exchange for ETH. The eventual plan is to introduce multi-collateral DAI whereby users can take out new DAI by putting up holdings of a variety of different cryptocurrencies – not just ETH – each with a unique ""debt ceiling.""  ""The debt ceiling should primarily reflect the extent to which [the MakerDAO system] is willing to generate DAI off of this collateral,"" explained Younessi on today's call. ""It should be constrained by the liquidity of the underlying asset.""  As such, Younessi added that changing the debt ceiling for DAI – presently backed only by ETH and with a hard supply cap of 100 million as a result – in his view was ""not a great idea.""  ""MakerDAO should want to accommodate as much debt ceiling and DAI generation as possible barring risk of collateral failing for the system. Messing with the DAI ceiling to affect the price of DAI seems like not the right approach,"" said Younessi.  Echoing Younessi's hesitation, call participant Lawson Baker called instead for more aggressive and dynamic fee hikes.  ""Using the DAI supply cap/debt ceiling is the functional equivalent of shutting down your app for new users. This is a bad idea ... Increase the costs until [user demand] slows enough to stabilize the system."" wrote Baker in today's call chatroom.  'Continuous polling'  For now, as stated by MakerDAO Foundation head of community development Richard Brown, the plan is to move into ""a process of continuous polling.""  ""The idea now is that every week we come out with the same options [for Stability Fee increases],"" explained Brown on the call. ""We do that until what I'm assuming in the happy, happy future we decide this is slightly onerous and unnecessary.""  For this to work, Brown emphasized the importance of continued voter turnout by holders of the MakerDAO governance token each week until DAI peg stability is restored.  ""Signaling is paramount,"" said Brown. ""Even if you're not going to move the needle, signaling any support of one of these options is an amazingly important data point.""  Calling the end of today's community vote ""potentially one of the records for voter turnout"" with 64 voters in total signaling for another four percent fee increase, Brown emphasized:  ""The success of this system hinges on the stability of DAI...Even if you're not going to move the needle, please vote.""

42430367,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsBLh,1555003804,21 US Lawmakers Urge IRS (Again) to Clarify Crypto Tax Rules,"With the deadline for Americans to file their taxes days away, more than 20 U.S. lawmakers have again urged the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to provide clarity on cryptocurrency questions.  The lawmakers' letter, addressed to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, explains that taxpayers may find it difficult to calculate how much they owe the agency due to unanswered questions about how the IRS is treating various cryptocurrencies.  The IRS issued guidance on the subject in 2014, but has not updated its guidance to acknowledge forks and other advances in the space since.  The bipartisan letter was signed by Reps. Tom Emmer, Darren Soto, David Schweikert, Warren Davidson and Ted Budd, among other lawmakers, and comes more than half a year after the IRS ignored a similar letter sent last fall.  ""There is still substantial ambiguity on a number of important questions about the federal taxation of virtual currencies,"" Thursday's letter explains.  'Urgent need'  The document lays out three specific areas where the lawmakers believe there is an ""urgent need"" for guidance:    Acceptable methods for calculating the cost basis of virtual currencies. Which specific methods does the IRS consider to constitute ""a reasonable manner that is consistently applied,"" as required by Notice 2014-21?    Acceptable methods of cost basis assignment and lot relief for virtual currencies. Do taxpayers need to use specific identification whenever they spend or exchange virtual currency, or are other methods, such as first-in-first-out or average cost basis, acceptable as well?    The tax treatment of forks for taxpayers that use virtual currencies, such as the 2017 hard fork of the Bitcoin blockchain.  However, the lawmakers say that these questions are not a complete list of topics that need clarity.  The Congressmen ""urge the IRS to issue more robust guidance clarifying taxpayers' obligations when using virtual currencies,"" and asked for a written response outlining how the IRS might develop this guidance by May 15 – a month after Tax Day.

42430379,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsBlh,1554998405,'Crypto Stripe' Flexa Raises $14 Million So You Can Buy Coffee With Bitcoin,"Consider yourself $14.1 million closer to buying your morning coffee with bitcoin.  New York-based payments startup Flexa just raised that amount in a private token sale involving Pantera Capital, 1kx, Nima Capital, Access Ventures and others.  The startup’s token, Flexacoin, is an ethereum-based ERC-20 token that will eventually be used by developers and businesses to stake value on Flexa’s network for merchant payment processing.  While Flexa co-founder Tyler Spalding declined to specify which merchants will accept bitcoin through this app, video tests show users buying Starbucks with it. (A Starbucks spokesperson told CoinDesk it is not working with Flexa.)  Spalding emphasized that Flexa is a business-to-business startup. Shoppers won’t need to hold or interact with Flexacoins at all. Flexa co-founder Trevor Filter said the details related to such governance and participation are still under development.  “The long-term goal is to give over the network to the merchants,” Filter added. “A sort of consortium of their own that allows them to accept crypto.”  Return of the token sale  Stepping back, Flexa is one of several companies to fundraise over the past six months through a private token sale without equity options. The predictions market startup Numerai announced a similar raise in March.  Access Ventures partner TJ Abood told CoinDesk his firm would have been interested in an equity offering as well. But as he’s also satisfied with Flexacoin because it allows his firm to participate in growing the network.  Businesses, from Access Ventures to merchants, can stake Flexacoin to the network and earn token rewards in a model comparable to proof-of-stake systems like Cosmos or Tezos. Flexa plans to launch a custodial crypto wallet app for its network, with users being able to spend crypto at point-of-sale with a type of QR code scan, similar to Apple Pay.  “We wanted the total Flexacoin supply to represent how much money can flow through the system right now,” Spalding told CoinDesk, adding that the network will launch on May 13. “All the participants earn money.”  Unlike Numerai’s token-fueled platform, Flexa’s network is not blockchain-based. Flexa’s approach to ethereum-compatibility, without complete reliance on that network, fit into Abood’s investment strategy.  “We subscribe to the idea of being a user-owner. Any company that we invest in, we immediately look to be a user,” Abood said. “Making use of the developer tools and all the system tools that exist to be able to deliver a superior product, that’s what drives us.”  On the other hand, 1kx cofounder Lasse Clausen told CoinDesk his firm also plans to become a staker because he believes for-profit tokenized networks are inherently better than traditional businesses. Speaking to Flexa’s symbiotic merchant acquisition strategy, Clausen added:  “If Flexa were a traditional for-profit venture, how would merchants be able to trust them that they won't end up raising fees once they have reached enough network effects?”  Bridges not blocks  Instead of building a blockchain-based network, Spalding described Flexa’s protocol as an “elegant pipe” that processes payments from various cryptocurrency networks, including bitcoin, ethereum, bitcoin cash and litecoin, to the merchant’s own payment processing system for direct bank transfers.  “We wanted to build essentially the Stripe for these type of transactions,” Filter said.  Abood said this merchant-oriented structure could entice mainstream brands that are crypto-curious by offering the ability to accept bitcoin without risk. According to Spalding, Flexa will partner with exchange platforms for liquidity on the back-end. Plus, the Flexacoin collateral could be used to compensate if there’s an issue with blockchain settlement.  “Flexa plays a critical role in blockchain adoption at-large because it is bridging this digital payments landscape into a brick-and-mortar setting,” Abood said. “It’s opening up the idea of spending cryptocurrency to a much broader audience.”  Filter described the Flexa protocol as bolting merchant’s traditional infrastructure to a crypto-friendly bridge, rather than relying on debit cards or credit cards. Since the process uses crypto wallets, there’s no personal information exposed the way a credit card payment would.  “I don’t think that blockchains are good for many things,” Spalding added. “But, they are amazingly powerful for fraud-free payments.”  In the future, Flexa plans to add support for various exchange-issued stablecoins and other crypto assets. Until then, the focus is on partnering with exchanges and merchants to make custom on-and-off ramps via the Flexa protocol.  “A driving source in [mainstream] adoption will be the availability to accept cryptocurrency and that’s a merchant decision,” Abood concluded.

42430371,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsBTh,1554994848,Binance Partners With CipherTrace in Latest Compliance Push,"Malta-based cryptocurrency exchange Binance is embarking on a multi-pronged push to boost compliance procedures across its platform.  To that end, Binance is announcing a new partnership with the blockchain analytics firm CipherTrace to enhance anti-money laundering (AML) processes like tracing the source of on-chain funds and matching user IDs to problematic wallet addresses.  “We are very serious about improving our compliance standards,” Samuel Lim, head of compliance at Binance, told CoinDesk. “We will continue to build our [compliance] team, continue to re-invest in the compliance space.”  The addition of CipherTrace, which is backed by venture firms such as Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital, comes on the heels of a new partnership with IdentityMind on know-your-customer (KYC) compliance. Binance also works with Chainalysis, Refinitiv (formerly the financial risk division of Thomson Reuters) and the Blockchain Transparency Institute (BTI), according to Lim.  “We want our users to have the best trading experience, to know that they are safe that they are not trading with crooks or bad actors,” he said.  For example, the analytics firm Whitestream identified a Binance account that allegedly received bitcoin from supporters of the military-political group Hamas, which the U.S. deems to be a terrorist organization. Most experts agree such cases are extremely rare.  Financial crimes present a more common reputational risk, especially considering the regtech startup Coinfirm identified Binance as an exchange that may not always enforce restrictions based on KYC requirements.  Along those lines, a BTI report released this week found that although Binance trading volumes were more than 85 percent authentic some wash trading – the practice of simultaneously buying and selling the same assets to create the illusion of market activity – was occuring with niche token pairs. So BTI development director Marco Paez told CoinDesk his research firm is working with Binance to crack down on wash trading.  Coupling those BTI insights with CiperTrace’s services could complement the broader compliance push across the Binance ecosystem. However, Lim said these partnerships are merely enhancing Binance’s existing capabilities, adding the exchange already has an in-house team with “dozens” of legal and blockchain analytics experts devoted to tasks like platform moderation, AML and KYC compliance.  Indeed, Lim said Binance’s compliance team is committed to continually raising the bar as the regulatory landscape and user behaviors also evolve.  Said Lim:  ""Compliance is always a quest, you are always on a journey to improve your compliance.""

42430373,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsBXh,1554991241,Digital Asset Scores Partnership With Cloud Computing Giant VMware,"Enterprise-focused distributed ledger tech startup Digital Asset (DA) has landed another high-profile partner.  Announced Thursday, software virtualization giant VMware is integrating DA's smart contract language into its own blockchain platform.  Further, VMware, a publicly traded company majority-owned by Dell Computer with more than 24,000 employees, will distribute the Digital Asset Modeling Language (DAML) with its VMware Blockchain platform directly to customers and through partners.  “DAML has been proven to be one of the few smart contract languages capable of modeling truly complex workflows at scale,” said Michael DiPetrillo, senior director of Blockchain at VMware, in a press release.  According to the companies, VMware Blockchain ""is deployed in enterprises worldwide,"" although further details weren't provided.  Palo Alto, California-based VMware first revealed last August that it had developed an open-source blockchain designed to be both scalable and energy-efficient, known as Project Concord. In 2017, the firm sought a patent for a system that would use blockchain as part of a wider effort to boost the speed of data transfers. Its main business is providing cloud computing and platform virtualization services to companies.  The team-up is the latest in a string of announcements by New York-based Digital Asset, which is best known for its former CEO, JPMorgan alum Blythe Masters, and its multi-year contract to rebuild the Australian Securities Exchange's aging CHESS system using DLT.  The startup recently open-sourced DAML and began working with the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) to aid the Wall Street trade group's effort to standardize data in complex financial contracts.

42430377,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsBfh,1554987641,World's Second-Largest Grocer Joins IBM Food Trust Blockchain,"Albertsons Companies, the world's second-largest supermarket company by sales, has joined IBM's Food Trust blockchain, a digital system for tracking and tracing food between retailers and suppliers.  Announced Thursday, Albertsons will begin with a pilot involving suppliers of romaine lettuce – a product which was last year linked to a widespread outbreak of E-coli resulting in recalls on a grand scale, 96 people being hospitalized and, tragically, five deaths.  Based in Boise, Idaho, Albertsons operates nearly 2,300 stores across the U.S., including the Safeway, Vons, Jewel-Osco, Shaw’s, and Acme chains. With $57 billion in sales in 2017, it was second only to Kroger among supermarket companies, according to The Balance Small Business. Albertsons' addition brings the total number of brands involved in Food Trust to over 80.  Arguably the jewel in the IBM Blockchain Platform crown, Food Trust, which went into live production in October of last year, tackles a critical problem in the commercial food chain: the ability to rapidly pinpoint a dodgy batch of produce and surgically remove those tainted goods from circulation so that retailers don’t have to empty their shelves of every item in the affected category, be that lettuce, spinach, beef, etc.  It appears to be a compelling proposition. Most recently Food Trust signed up European supermarket giant Carrefour, to join other food business giants such as Walmart, Nestle, Dole Food, Tyson Foods, Kroger and Unilever. According to Big Blue, more than 500,000 traces have been conducted on the platform to date (each trace represents a single lot, although the number of items per lot varies from company to company).  Rucha Nanavati, group vice president for IT at Albertsons, told CoinDesk:  “I truly believe there's power in numbers. Now all those big companies can come together and ask suppliers to come on the platform. We always had technology in supply chain but now with all the data you can gather the potential is there to take it a step further.”  She explained that the food industry has always had a firm focus on safety but said doing recalls efficiently is difficult, first involving the internal supply chain and then looking into the external supply chain. “What we had before wasn't this efficient, that's for sure,” she said.  As early as 2016, IBM and Walmart began testing blockchain to reduce the time to track goods. A proof of concept done with the Tsinghua University of Beijing focused on China’s massive pork market, reduced the time taken from days to minutes.  This can now be done in seconds flat, said Suzanne Livingston, offering director for IBM Food Trust. Whereas typically “these investigations can take months in some cases to get to a root source, some investigations don't get to a root source so the companies are left to get all products off the shelf,” she said.  Nanavati said Albertsons is already thinking about the next categories of products to add, but that for now, the focus is on ensuring the romaine pilot succeeds, which will take “weeks” rather than the typical “months and months.""  The Walmart mandate  Having been a key platform partner to IBM Food Trust, Walmart last year issued a mandate to all its suppliers of leafy greens stating that they had to get on to the blockchain by a deadline of the end of September 2019.  Asked whether Albertsons will follow Walmart in mandating that its suppliers use Food Trust, Nanavati said:  “I think we are in a position to do so. It is going to benefit the customers in general. Are we there yet? I don't believe so. I think mandate or not, we would recommend it.”  It’s not uncommon for large retailers to demand quite exacting quality assurances from suppliers down the line. Nanavati said that Albertsons has seen some of its suppliers coming forward and asking to be involved in Food Trust.  As far as Walmart’s mandate goes, IBM’s Livingston said that while “it does work hands down if you make it a requirement,” she acknowledged some retailers are against this approach and don’t want to send a message entailing further requirements to their suppliers.  “I see it being good and also having some drawbacks. I think it’s beneficial [to participate] for all parties whether you are mandated to do it or not because it's in your best interests,” said Livingston.  Nanavati added that Albertsons has been working with IBM to make sure getting data on the blockchain is easy for suppliers large and small.  “I have this vision that I want some farmer who only has these two fields but we care deeply about them, that they be able to just use their smartphone and do something quick for tracing,” she said.  Looking beyond food safety, Albertsons is also exploring how blockchain can assure consumers of the provenance of its extensive “Own Brands” portfolio, worth about $11bn per annum. Carrefour also mentioned this use of the tech, in conjunction with an app which easily lets customers trace the life cycle of its organic chickens.  “The joke is consumers now want to know where their chicken's parents were from,” said Nanavati.  Trusting competitors  It’s notable that IBM seems to have had a relatively smooth ride getting competing firms to join the Food Trust blockchain.  Livingston attributed this to careful consideration on the technical side of things regarding data privacy.  “We knew we would have competitors on this so we asked what they wanted,"" she said. ""They told us they wanted it to be permissioned and they wanted fine-grain access control on the data, to be able to stipulate who has access for every transaction and for everyone who comes into the system. If they want, they can make it completely private.”  She also said the establishment of a Food Trust Governance Committee has helped reassure players of a level playing field.  Looking at blockchain consortia in other industries, banks, for example, remain skittish about sharing data, even when encrypted. Meanwhile, ocean carriers don't appear to trust each other enough to get on a distributed ledger together.  So is the food production and supply chain industry more convivial?  Nanavati said a better word would be “responsible” since disasters in food supply chain can really impact people’s lives, concluding:  “This is not the place to compete in my opinion. This is one place where it’s about serving the interests of our customers. Food safety is paramount. It's table stakes.”  Alberstons supermarket image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/04/11/worlds-second-largest-grocer-joins-ibm-food-trust-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c2f4937a9b800160dfa559f9380a4f5fb488a86a-1500x997.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42430369,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsBNh,1554987632,Pennsylvania's State-Backed VC Firm Is Tokenizing an Investment Fund,"The venture capital arm of Pennsylvania's economic development office is tokenizing one of its funds.  Ben Franklin Technology Partners of Southeastern Pennsylvania, one of four regional outposts formed by the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development in 1982, launched the Global Opportunity Philadelphia Fund, or GO Philly Fund, in February with $15 million committed.  Unlike Ben Franklin, which receives funds from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and is restricted to investing in the companies based in the Greater Philadelphia area, GO Philly can raise funds and invest globally, but will focus primarily on the Philly area-based companies, Scott Nissenbaum, Ben Franklin's chief investment officer and a managing partner of GO Philly, told CoinDesk.  Working with the California-based token platform Securitize, GO Philly is looking to raise another $35 million by selling GO Philly Fund tokens to accredited investors.  “GO Philly Fund has been a trailblazer, not only in the blockchain space, but also as an impact fund,” Securitize CEO and co-founder Carlos Domingo told CoinDesk via a spokesperson. ""We are proud to be partnering with them as their technology provider.""  Built on top of the ethereum blockchain, the GO Philly Token will be available for purchase by accredited investors at $0.50 apiece, in dollars, bitcoin or ether – but the minimum buy-in is $250,000.  Big investors first  The $50 million fund was created in partnership with a publicly traded IT company, EPAM. GO Philly raised more than $15 million pre-launch: with $5 million from Ben Franklin, $5 million from EPAM and the rest from investment firms including Fulton Financial Corporation, SRI Capital and Provco Group.  These investors have already secured their bags of GO Philly tokens, with the first batch being sold on Feb. 7. Nissenbaum sees that early action as an assurance to new investors:  ""There are so many question in this market about what's real and what's not. So we decided that we are going to bring big companies first, and then the rest of the entire globe can also buy in.""  GO Philly is expecting to sell 100 million tokens in total, including the portion already sold. The tokens will be ""a digital representation of a limited partnership contract"" and comply with the SEC's Rule 506(c), Nissenbaum explained.  When payout?  The token holders' money will fund GO Philly's efforts and earn them a profit if the supported startups flourish.  ""All the value we will create in those companies will flow back to the token holders,"" Nissenbaum said.  The advantage of the token model, he said, is that, if an investor wants to get out, it's easier to sell a token than a limited partnership in a venture fund, given that GO Philly is going to create a secondary market for such tokens in the future – though the legal structure of that future entity is not yet disclosed.  However, the tokens won't have the profit distribution functionality: instead of smart contracts, traditional bank transfers will deliver money to the owners of the digital securities. GO Philly also won’t hold crypto, even though it’s allowing investors to buy tokens with bitcoin and ether. The BTC and ETH will be immediately sold for cash, Nissenbaum said.  The Philly-area Ben Franklin invested $8.1 million into 51 startups in 2018, according to its annual report. Its total portfolio includes 227 companies leveraging $354 million in assets.  Securitize, a Coinbase-backed digital asset platform, recently announced the launch of a ""one-stop shop"" for various token-related services, with Coinbase Custody, OpenFinance, Rialto Trading and CBlock Capital as the first participants.

The move is consistent with past sentiments voiced by founders of the New York-based company, which in late 2017 were critical of token sales to private investors, arguing at the time that they did not enable enough diverse participants to create a truly decentralized software network.  Still, the company has been forced to walk back its ambitions given the U.S. regulatory environment, raising $50 million through a sale of 440 million tokens in December of that year.  Investors at the time included Union Square Ventures, Foundation Capital, Winklevoss Capital and Blockchain Capital, among others. More than 800 people were said to participate in the sale.  Muneeb Ali, co-founder and CEO of Blockstack, said in a statement: “We’ve been working with securities lawyers to create a legal framework that can enable blockchain protocols to comply with SEC regulations.”  He continued:  ""This can potentially set a precedent for others in the industry, not just for public offerings, but also as a path to launch new public blockchains and establish a path to bootstrapping decentralized ecosystems.""  According to the filing, Blockstack now employs 21 employees and $32 million in total assets.

The number one cryptocurrency by market valuation made a strong bullish break from an ascending triangle pattern yesterday evening at 18:00 UTC, reaching a peak of $5,488 on the Coinbase exchange. However, that move was quickly rejected and an increase in selling pressure on today’s open laid the pathway for bitcoin to slide, first to $5,200 overnight, then quickly to $5,018 soon before press time.  At press time, bitcoin is trading at $5,068, down over 3 percent for the session, as per CoinDesk price data.  The drop may now have thrown a spanner into a bullish market setup that had looked likely to propel prices to highs not seen since late last year. Had bitcoin’s triangle breakout succeeded, a measured move to $5,800 may have been on the cards. However, bitcoin fell $300 short of that target as buyer volume fell short on the day.  With bitcoin taking a hit, the wider crypto market is also flashing red at press time. Other top tokens, such as ether and XRP are fairing worse than bitcoin, posting 24-hour losses of 7.46 and 5.85 percent, respectively, according to CoinMarketCap data.

42430376,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsBbh,1554973522,Tata Settles Securities Between National Depositories on a Blockchain,"India's second largest firm by market valuation has completed a blockchain trial of cross-border securities settlement between two central securities depositories (CSDs).  Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) announced Wednesday that the ""successful"" pilot project created a set of equity and fixed income securities for Morocco's Maroclear depository and the Kuwait Clearing Company on the BaNCS Network – the firm's multi-asset transaction management system implemented on its Quartz blockchain. Segregated accounts to hold the securities were also created.  In tests conducted by the CSDs, cross-border settlement instructions for these securities were matched and settled “instantaneously” using blockchain, TCS said, with confirmation notifications also arriving in real time.  The pilot transactions were settled with “cash coins,” a fiat-pegged stablecoin, on the Quartz blockchain using a delivery versus payment (DVP) model.  “Cash coins in a blockchain network enable seamless and real-time DVP settlement of cross-border securities transactions,” the firm said, adding that having no delay in settlement “significantly” reduces the currency risks associated with such transactions.  TCS Financial Solutions vice president and co-head R. Vivekanand, said:  “Real-time cross-border settlement with cash coins reduces risks, costs and has the potential to create enhanced liquidity in markets in Middle East and Africa.“  By using technologies like blockchain, ""we can overcome limitations in prevailing business models and create new business opportunities for our customers,"" said Fathia Bennis, CEO of Maroclear.  Earlier this week, TCS revealed that its Quartz blockchain solution enables clients to connect to RippleNet, a blockchain-based payments infrastructure from Ripple, in order to help them process cross-border forex remittance transactions.  As far back as 2016, TCS said it was working on over 100 blockchain pilot projects.

42430374,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsBZh,1554969639,US Energy Department Eyes Blockchain to Prevent Power Plant Cyberattacks,"The U.S. Department of Energy is exploring blockchain technology as a line of defense against cyberattacks on power plants.  The department’s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) unit announced Wednesday that phase two of an electric grid security project has been launched in partnership with decentralized cybersecurity startup Taekion, formerly Grid7.  The laboratory provided a grant of $1 million to Taekion last year, and now as part of the second phase of the project, the startup will research on how blockchain technology can be used to secure a power plant, by keeping all sensor, actuator and device transactions on a distributed ledger.  “Accurate information on the status of power plant operations is critical for electric grid security,” NETL said, adding that, when the storage of key information is decentralized, “there is no single point of failure.”  In an example of how a cyberattack could take place on a power plant, the lab said a system could be compromised so that it appears operational when it has actually been shut down by hackers, potentially ""leaving millions without power."" Such an attack took place at a power plant in Ukraine in 2016, the laboratory said, which caused widespread power outages during the winter months.  NETL said:  “The applications being developed in the NETL-managed project have the potential to thwart such attacks by preventing hackers from altering the plant’s operational information.”  Taekion plans to work on other applications, too, that would help secure energy transactions to protect process data at power generation facilities, increase grid reliability and integrate a more decentralized energy infrastructure.  The project is part of the energy department’s Office of Fossil Energy Sensors and Controls program and is funded through the department’s Small Business Innovation Research program.  This is not the first time that the department has looked to explore blockchain for technological improvements. Last year, it partnered with BlockCypher to develop solutions allowing energy transactions to be settled across multiple blockchains.  The department also recently announced federal funding of up to $4.8 million for universities working on R&D projects, including those related to blockchain.

42430365,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsBHh,1554948955,China's New Policy Isn't An Automatic Bitcoin Mining Ban – Here's Why,"The Takeaway:  A draft proposal from China’s economic planning commission labels bitcoin mining as an industry that needs to be “eliminated.” But even if finalized in its current form, this would not automatically amount to an outright mining ban.  While local governments are supposed to follow the commission’s guidance, to take action against an industry they need a basis in the laws of the state, not industrial policy.  Further, there are past examples of “undesirable” industries that were eventually recategorized because phasing them out was found to conflict with local interests.  Seizing on this, miners are arguing that eliminating their industry would also conflict with local interests, in part because they soak up excess electricity that would otherwise go to waste.      One of these things is not like the others.  On Sept. 4, 2017, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), together with six other central government agencies and financial regulators, banned initial coin offerings (ICOs).  Later that month, regulators ordered the country’s bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchanges to shut down.  And on April 8 of this year, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), China’s top macroeconomic planner and one of 26 cabinet-level agencies which form the State Council, published a draft proposal to amend the Catalog for Guiding Industrial Restructure.  The proposed revision, still pending public consultation, classifies “virtual currency mining, such as the production process of bitcoin” as an industry category that’s undesirable and to be eliminated, together with hundreds of other sectors.  The news was widely covered, with most media outlets leaping to the conclusion that China now wants to ban cryptocurrency mining, just as it did in 2017 with ICOs and domestic spot trading.  But to call this policy a “ban” in the same sense is misleading at best. The reality is more nuanced, and requires additional context to fully understand.  Below, CoinDesk takes a close look at the history of the NDRC’s policy recommendations to clarify what this latest guidance really means – and why it does not automatically amount to an outright ban.  A provision and a catch  The NDRC first published its catalog in 2005, grouping industrial sectors into three types – those the agency advises the country to encourage, restrict or eliminate.  It defined those to be eliminated as industries that have obsolete techniques, products, and technology, or which are unlawful, unsafe, wasteful or pollutive.  The purpose of the catalog is to serve as a macro-level economic policy to guide local governments on how to allocate their investment and resources to balance local economic growth with overall stability.  To give such policy a legal status, the State Council promulgated an “Interim Provisions on Promoting Industrial Structure Adjustment” for implementation in December 2005.  According to a translation by LexisNexis (full document included at the end of this article), Article 19 of the Interim Provisions clarifies what local governments shall do with industries that are categorized as to be eliminated.  “[Government] Investments are prohibited from being contributed to projects of the eliminated category. All financial institutions shall stop various forms of credit granting supports to such projects, and take measures to recover the granted loans,” the Article reads, adding:  “If any enterprise of the eliminated category refuses to eliminate the production technique, equipment or products, the local people’s government at each level and the relevant administrative department shall, in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations of the state, order it to stop production or close it.”  Therefore, indeed, local governments are required to take proper actions to implement what’s outlined in the NDRC’s policy guide.  But there’s a notable catch: the part about “the relevant laws and regulations of the state.”  Kai Xu, a legal practitioner in China with expertise in corporate governance and compliance, explained to CoinDesk that local governments must use related laws and regulations – not the Interim Provisions itself – as a legal basis to take forceful actions to shut down “undesirable” companies.  For instance, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce recently published a provision for administrative penalty when regulating businesses like internet advertising and e-commerce.  It outlines who is entitled to take forceful administrative actions against companies violating regulations, what the penalties are and how they should be carried out.  “Because such an action is an administrative penalty, it must have a legal ground first,” Xu said. “It’s currently unclear [how or what types of laws bitcoin mining should fall under].”  He added that the legal nature of the NDRC’s policy is different from that of the ICO ban announced by the central bank in 2017 (which clearly defined the nature of ICOs as an illegal activity, meaning any entity that still engages in that activity is subject to legal actions).  “The former is an industry policy and the latter is a departmental regulatory document,” he said.  Local interest  Also importantly, the State Council emphasized at the top of the 2005 Interim Provisions that local governments, when implementing the industrial policy, are also required to balance the government guidance and the functions of the market as well as local interests.  It states:  “The relevant governments and departments shall, when implementing the ‘Interim Provisions’, correctly deal with the relationship between government guidance and market regulation, give full play to the fundamental role of the market in allocating resources, correctly deal with the relationship between development and stability, that between partial interests and overall interests, and that between immediate interests and long-term interests, so as to keep the stable and fast development of the economy.”  Xu told CoinDesk that if the final form of the policy guide includes bitcoin mining as a category to be eliminated, it will be the job of local governments and relevant departments to implement actual executional plans.  But he also pointed out there is always the possibility that a policy will not be enforced or implemented in the end, adding:  “There are many reasons to that, since executions are carried out by human beings, after all. And there may also be information costs during implementation, as well as conflicts with local interest.”  And members of the local mining community have also raised questions about whether it’s reasonable to label bitcoin mining as an industry to be eliminated, arguing that such a decision could potentially conflict with local interest.  Alex Ao, founder of Innosilicon, which manufactures cryptocurrency mining equipment, said in China’s Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang and southwestern provinces like Sichuan and Yunnan, there is excessive electricity generated every year that can neither be fully consumed by local demand nor be integrated to the State Grid to be transmitted to regions outside.  For instance, the Garze prefecture government in Sichuan has said that in 2017 alone, hydropower plants in the area generated 41.5 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity thanks to the rainy season in the summer.  But a total excess of 16.3 billion kWh went to waste due to not enough local consumption, which resulted in a direct economic loss of some 4 billion yuan, or $600 million, for local hydropower companies.  Tyler Xiong, chief marketing officer of Bixin, which operates a mining pool and wallet service, echoed that sentiment.  “First, bitcoin mining doesn’t result in pollution. It actually helps consume excessive electricity [generated by local plants] that would otherwise go to waste. And it creates jobs and revenue locally,” he said. “Eliminating that could conflict with local interest because it can benefit the local economy.”  The public now has until May 7 to submit feedback on the NDRC draft proposal. While it’s unclear when the final version will be published, the draft comes at a time when Chinese bitcoin miners have been investing to scale up their mining capacity to capture on the cheap electricity during the summer.  What happened before?  It’s worth noting that the NDRC had published and revised the policy guide multiple times over the past decade. What happened to some of the industries that were previously labeled as to be eliminated?  While it is difficult to grasp a full picture of the actual implementation over the years, one article from the People’s Daily in 2006 described certain issues local governments in Hebei encountered when eliminating energy-intensive sectors such as cement manufacturing, following the 2005 policy guide.  The article cited a comment from an official from the NDRC, explaining the policy guide was not a legal basis for taking forceful actions to shut down companies.  “It must be done in accordance to relevant laws,” the official said, a point echoed by Xu above.  In the cement-making instance, the article said most local governments used laws and regulations relating to land resources and environment management as a legal basis for taking actions.  And there are also examples where certain items were first marked for elimination, but later removed from the category, thanks to feedback gathered during implementation.  For example, in 2011, the production equipment for manufacturing cold-rolled ribbed bar (a material used in construction) was classified as a sector that should be eliminated.  In a revised version in 2013, the NDRC adjusted the wording to specify that only certain types of cold-rolled ribbed bar equipment with productivity below a threshold should be eliminated.  The NDRC explained in a separate note that the reason for the revision was because during implementation, the industry had provided feedback that there was still a considerable amount of domestic demand for cold-rolled ribbed bar making.  After gathering and studying such feedback with relevant government departments, the Commission agreed that some equipment with higher productivity and efficiency should be kept.  None of this is to downplay the attitude shown in the policy guide from the NDRC, which clearly voices a stance of not supporting cryptocurrency mining in China.  Yet the main questions that are now in the air is whether the final form of the policy will still include bitcoin mining in the “undesirable” category, and if so, how lawmakers and local governments will carry out the implementation – especially when it conflicts with potential local interest.
