Despite remaining the second-largest meme coin, it has continued to decline in price and this has caused the asset to fall below very crucial support. And now that SHIB is now sitting at the $0.000008 level, is it a good time to buy the meme coin? Shiba Inu Falls Below Critical Level For Shiba Inu, the $0.000009 price level has served as good support for it through the ups and downs of the crypto market over the last year. This made it the most important point for bears to beat if they were to take control of the digital asset. However, over the last week, SHIB has fallen below $0.000009 which could present a good buying opportunity for the digital asset. Related Reading: Decentraland (MANA) Leads Crypto Market Gains, Here‚Äôs Why One reason why buying SHIB could be a good play right now is that the developments by the team are yet to reflect in the performance of the coin. Also, with the launch of the four new hubs in Shib: The Metaverse coming soon, the meme coin could see renewed interest and this interest could lead to a price rally. SHIB price falls below $0.000009 support | Source: SHIBUSD on TradingView.com The market has also been consolidating for a while with the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum trading sideways for the last week. Once this consolidation ends, the likelihood of these large assets rallying upward remains high. And as always, a rally in these top cryptocurrencies would pull the rest of the market up with it. If Bitcoin were to move above $30,000 again, SHIB could go as high as $0.00001 once more, which would mean a more than 10% gain for investors in the short run. Over the long term, the gains could be higher, assuming that the market has not completely exited its bull trend. SHIB Could Be A Breakout Star The Shiba Inu team continues to rapidly develop the ecosystem and the latest in its long line of products is its SHIB-themed cold wallets. These wallets have been in the works for a while and the official SHIB handle confirmed on Twitter that the wallets will be ready for preorder on May 29. The wallets are being developed in partnership with Swiss company Tangem to allow users to hold more than 6,000 coins. #SHIBARMY! @Tangem is about to unleash SHIB-themed cold wallets! üéâ These card-shaped vaults are set to become your new best friend for safeguarding our ecosystem's tokens.

12782876,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=534098,1684529438,Gas Crisis Averted: NFT Marketplaces Witness Dramatic Reduction in Ethereum Fees,"Ethereum gas consumption landscape is transforming significantly as Non-Fungible Token (NFT) marketplaces no longer dominate the network‚Äôs gas usage. According to a report by Nansen,¬†a crypto analytics platform, NFTs have fallen behind in doing the most in Ethereum gas fees. Notably, while Ethereum‚Äôs transition to proof-of-stake, in an event known as ‚ÄúThe Merge,‚Äù is anticipated to address high gas prices, investors are now exploring alternatives like Cardano, which boasts greater cost-efficiency following its recent Hydra upgrade. Ethereum‚Äôs Gas Consumption Shift According to data revealed by Nansen on Friday, there‚Äôs currently a noteworthy shift in Ethereum‚Äôs gas consumption patterns. NFT marketplaces, which once held the top spot, now account for a mere 3% of total gas usage. Related Reading: Crypto Assets Flow From Ethereum To BSC, Are Users Escaping High Gas Fees? Surprisingly, decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap has emerged as the primary gas consumer, representing 31.99% of gas consumption. This shift indicates a diversification in Ethereum‚Äôs transactional activity and a reduction in NFT-related gas usage. Nansen noted: Gone were the days of NFTs topping the Ethereum gas-consuming charts. This week, of the top 20 gas consumers, OpenSea and Blur accounted for less than 10% combined.¬†And against all gas consumers, the NFT marketplaces were just over 3%. Uniswap in contrast was 10x more ‚Äì 31.99%. This substantial decline in NFT-related gas consumption can be attributed to various factors, including the network‚Äôs congestion caused by an influx of meme coin trading, notably the recently hyped frog-themed meme coin PEPE. This surge in meme coin transactions resulted in heightened gas prices, prompting users to explore alternatives and alleviating the burden on NFT marketplaces. Navigating the Gas Crisis Ethereum‚Äòs gas crisis has persisted despite The Merge, which is said to enhance scalability and reduce gas fees by migrating the network to a proof-of-stake consensus model. In response, some investors have sought solace in blockchain platforms offering cost-efficient alternatives. With its recent Hydra upgrade, Cardano has gained attention for its ability to handle transactions more economically. The implementation of Hydra‚Äôs layer-2 scaling solution has positioned Cardano as a viable option for users seeking relief from Ethereum‚Äôs high gas prices. The recent decrease in NFT marketplaces‚Äô gas consumption marks a significant turning point in Ethereum‚Äôs gas crisis. As decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and other transaction-heavy platforms take the lead in gas consumption, the burden on NFT marketplaces has lessened. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Faces Confluence Of Bearish Factors and At Risk of Another Decline However, the broader Ethereum community anticipates the implementation of updates on the mainnet to address the persistent gas issues and improve scalability on the network.

42410702,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdgGQA,1684528496,Demand for Tokenized Treasury Bonds Soars as Crypto Investors Chase TradFi Yield,"Demand for tokenized versions of U.S. Treasury bonds is soaring as rising yields in traditional financial markets attract fresh capital from crypto investors.  The combined market capitalization of tokenized money market funds nears $500 million, and has quadrupled in size this year, according to data compiled by CoinDesk.  Money market funds are traditional investment products that hold short-term government securities and offer a relatively safe way to earn a yield. Investors have been flocking to these funds for their perceived safety from failing banks and their 4-5% interest rate offering compared to bank deposits.  The high yields of government bonds have also captivated digital asset investors discouraged by low lending rates and last year‚Äôs bankruptcies. Hence, a slew of platforms have come up with a way to offer access to them on the blockchain in the form of a token.  The first and largest offering, investment giant Franklin Templeton‚Äôs Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX) ‚Äì which gives a BENJI token on the Stellar blockchain representing one share ‚Äì grew to $276 million in assets as of the end of April. This is almost triple the deposits in early January represented by the BENJI token supply, blockchain data shows.  New challengers are quickly catching up in market share. Ondo Finance‚Äôs OUSG and Matrixdock‚Äôs STBT tokenized products both opened for investors in January and each backed by short-term government bonds, have raked in $132 million and $72 million of funds so far, respectively, according to Dune Analytics dashboard by Steakhouse Financial.  Recent entrants also experienced substantial inflows. Switzerland-based Backed Asset‚Äôs tokenized short-term government bond fund (bIB01) now has $4.6 million assets under management since its March release, according to Etherscan.  Singapore-based OpenEden, a platform that lets USDC stablecoin holders invest in a Treasury bond vault by minting yield-generating TBILL tokens, has already gained $4.8 million of deposits in two months, per Dune data. The protocol opened two weeks ago for the public.  Tokenization wave  The tokenization of real world assets such as government bonds has emerged as one of the hottest trends in crypto this year. Banking giant JPMorgan called it the killer app for blockchain, while Bank of America said it‚Äôs a key driver for digital asset adoption.  Tokenized money market funds are especially in demand among those who hold large amounts of stablecoins, a token version of U.S. dollar cash. These include digital asset investment funds, crypto companies and decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) treasuries, Eugene Ng, co-founder of OpenEden, said in an interview.  Fund investors are taking an increasingly sophisticated approach when it comes to on-chain cash management, Justin Schmidt, president and chief operating officer of Ondo Finance, said in a note. ‚ÄúA low-risk asset that pays meaningful yield in token form can serve as a valuable option for CFOs [chief financial officers] as they position their treasury operations for success.‚Äù  The fact that established players are also coming into the space, merging blockchain technology with traditional finance, also fuels growth, according to Doug Schwenk, chief executive officer of Digital Asset Research, a research and crypto data provider for institutional clients.  ‚ÄúBrands like Franklin Templeton and Ondo Finance are bringing more trust to an asset that would be viewed more skeptically,‚Äù Schwenk said.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | ONDO,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/19/demand-for-tokenized-treasury-bonds-soars-as-crypto-investors-chase-tradfi-yield,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/12aadf777b36dc32a0cd75e657cfee15fdcd5e22-1893x1065.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

BTC‚Äôs price rose to nearly $27,200 late Friday morning as Powell ‚Äì appearing with former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke at the Thomas Laubach Research Conference ‚Äì said credit stress could mean interest rates would not have to go as high as previously thought.  ‚ÄúThe financial stability tools helped to calm conditions in the banking sector,‚Äù said Powell. ‚ÄúDevelopments there, on the other hand, are contributing to tighter credit conditions and are likely to weigh on economic growth, hiring and inflation,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúAs a result, our policy rate may not need to rise as much as it would have otherwise to achieve our goals.‚Äù  Powell said the assessment of the upcoming interest rate decision will be ‚Äúan ongoing one‚Äù as he previously highlighted in the press conference following May‚Äôs Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. ‚ÄúHaving come this far, we can afford to look at the data and the evolving outlook and make careful assessments,‚Äù he said.

Among the 22 individuals and 104 entities in the sanctions list published Friday, there is one cryptocurrency wallet, first spotted by the blockchain intelligence company Elliptic. The wallet on the Ethereum blockchain belongs to a 48-y.o. United Arab Emirates resident from Ireland, John Desmond Hanafin, according to OFAC.  A wallet related to a company he led, according to the blockchain data, received over $5.2 million in the tether stablecoin (USDT) since the beginning of the war.  According to OFAC, Hanafin helped high-net-worth Russian citizens obtain passports from other countries, as well as move money across borders while Russia has been cut off from major global payment networks by previous sanctions.  As a chief executive officer of Huriya Private FZE LLE, an UAE-based private equity and corporate structuring entity, Hanafin helped moving money from Russia into the UAE, using his firm as intermediary, the OFAC press release said. To launch the operations in the UAE, Hanafin worked together with Yulia Sergeeva, employee of a Moscow-based investment banking firm Aquila Capital Group, which also is under sanctions now.  It‚Äôs not clear for what purposes Hanafin and his company used crypto. The wallet designated by OFAC received a bunch of large transactions since Feb. 2022, one for as much as 1,132,000 USDT. Most of the money sent to the wallet came from centralized exchanges like Binance, Huobi, OKX and the now-bankrupt FTX, according to the data on Etherscan.  OFAC also sanctioned Cryptovenience and CryptAnet, firms controlled by a Swiss national Anselm Oskar Schmucki.  ‚ÄúSchmucki controls a global network of shell companies and has had close financial relationships with an individual charged with financial crimes and a company with suspected links to Russian organized crime and money laundering,‚Äù OFAC press release said.

Bitcoin was higher by about 0.7% over the past seven days at $26,880, while ether was ahead 0.5% over the same time frame as its overall supply contracted by 24,000 tokens.  The biggest winners of the week for those coins with a $1 billion market cap or more were Litecoin (LTC), and ether staking solution Lido (LDO), up 13% and 12%, respectively.  Litecoin‚Äôs performance was partially driven by the launch of its LTC-20 token standard, an upgrade that allows non-fungible tokens (NFT‚Äôs) to be attached to its blockchain. Now with a gain of 30% year-to-date, litecoin has drawn recent attention as possibly trading at a potential discount relative to fair value, given its market value to realized value (MVRV) Z score.  Laggards in large-cap crypto were Quant Network (QNT) and Cosmos (ATOM), falling 3.8% and 5.7%, respectively.  For those who trade bitcoin and ether intraday, there were some wide swings in price action as initial jobless claims, uncertainty around U.S. debt negotiations, and hawkish and then dovish comments from Federal Reserve officials knocked prices around.  To wit, a report Friday morning that GOP officials walked out of debt negotiations saw BTC prices quickly switch from rally to slump, and then back to modest rally again.  Alongside the negative impact of stalled debt negotiations was optimism on softer monetary policy following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell‚Äôs comments that interest rates may not need to rise as much as previously expected.

According to a recent report by DappRadar, NFT sales could fall below $1 billion for the first time this year. Related Reading: XRP Ledger On Fire: Daily Transactions Skyrocket 10.7% In Q1 2023 NFT Market Facing Headwinds According to the report, the NFT market shows signs of a potential shift in May 2023, with the trading volume reaching $333 million from $2.3 million in sales, a trend that may result in the first month of this year with a trading volume under $1 billion. Despite this decline in sales, the NFT industry is still showing strong activity and engagement, with daily unique active wallets (dUAW) linked to NFT activities reaching 173,000, marking a 27% increase from the previous month. However, the NFT market is facing significant challenges, with many traders selling their large NFT holdings at a loss to participate in the Memecoin frenzy, according to DappRadar. This has led to an uptick in on-chain activity, driving Ethereum‚Äôs gas fees above $100 and negatively impacting the volume of low-value NFT trades on the blockchain. Despite this, the NFT market is still experiencing significant developments and events. Elon Musk‚Äôs tweet on May 10, 2023, referencing the Milady Maker collection, fueled a trading volume spike, reaching $13.95 million and doubling the number of trades in the same week. Additionally, the Pudgy Penguins project secured $9 million in seed funding, debuting the Pudgy Toys collection, which amassed a total trading volume of $7.89 million the following week. Furthermore, the top ten NFT sales reveal stalwarts like the Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks dominating the NFT landscape. However, a new entrant has emerged in the sixth position ‚Äì an ADA handle, a personal crypto domain on the ADA blockchain, sold for $182,089, equivalent to 500,000 ADA. Bitcoin Ordinals vs. NFTs Bitcoin Ordinals, a new form of digital asset, has become a hot topic in the decentralized app (dapp) community since its launch by software engineer Casey Rodarmor on January 21. This protocol has garnered a significant following, with over 7.4 million Ordinals minted at the time of writing. Ordinals differ from NFTs as they house all their data directly on-chain, earning the label ‚Äúdigital artifacts‚Äù. This feature makes Ordinals a potential technical upgrade to NFTs and a shift in Bitcoin‚Äôs cultural landscape. However, the rise of Ordinals and the BRC-20 token standard, which enables the deployment of meme coins on the Bitcoin blockchain, has provoked concern among Bitcoin maxis. These innovations have strained the Bitcoin network, leading to a backlog of unconfirmed transactions and increased fees. The spike in transaction demand caused fees to soar to $31 on May 8, 2023, according to DappRadar‚Äôs report. Despite the challenges, the increased activity has boosted miner fees, enhancing the overall security of the Bitcoin blockchain. The surge in fees indicates a growing number of people using Bitcoin for non-financial purposes, such as creating and trading Ordinals and speculation on tokens. The Ordinals Protocol has given rise to intriguing collections and impressive sales, with Ordinal Punks and TwelveFold as notable examples. These collections have seen trading volumes, in the past 30 days, of 11.85 BTC and 14.9 BTC, respectively, indicating significant interest and engagement in the new digital asset. Related Reading: Lido‚Äôs ETH Deposits Reach Record High Amid Stagnant stETH Withdrawals The introduction of Bitcoin Ordinals represents an exciting development in the NFT space, opening up new possibilities for digital asset creation and trading. However, it also highlights the need for continued innovation and upgrades to address the challenges posed by increased activity and demand on the Bitcoin network.

42410710,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdgH0X,1684516790,Ledger‚Äôs Hard Lesson: Being Right Isn't Good Enough,"Ledger, the Paris-based hardware wallet maker, has had a terrible week. And in large part, it seems they have themselves to blame.  Things started out badly enough. Ledger‚Äôs May 16 introduction of the ‚ÄúLedger Recover‚Äù seed phrase recovery service was greeted with skepticism from the crypto community, who worried about new security risks being introduced to one of the most widely-trusted hardware wallets on the market.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Then it all got much worse. By midweek, Twitter filled with wild speculation that Ledger devices were now compromised. There were even Ledger-smashing videos of a sort normally associated with far-right culture war boycotts. In part that was thanks to spiraling paranoia, social-media hyperbole and basic misunderstandings of crypto architecture. But Ledger‚Äôs own communications also poured fuel on the fire.  The incident‚Äôs key takeaway for other crypto companies is simple: It‚Äôs not enough to be technically correct, especially in a crisis. As crypto attracts more and more users with limited technical knowledge, it‚Äôs more important than ever to communicate clearly and carefully.  In other words, it‚Äôs important to not make tweets like this. For the sake of our industry.  You can‚Äôt handle the truth  Some of those piling on to attack Ledger have simply misunderstood that the new Ledger Recover service, and the identity documentation involved, are entirely optional. Ledger Recover is aimed at less rigorous crypto users who may want an insurance policy against losing their private keys. Strategically for Ledger, and frankly for crypto as a whole, offering this sort of middle-ground security option makes sense.  But the backlash only spun further out of control after someone at Ledger, purportedly a customer support agent, tweeted that ‚Äútechnically speaking it is and always has been possible to write firmware that facilitates key extraction.‚Äù  Now here‚Äôs the thing: while Ledger has wisely deleted and rephrased its message, this tweet seems to be basically accurate. As cryptography pioneer Christopher Allen laid out in this Twitter thread, ‚Äúall it requires is a signed firmware update and seeds can go wherever they want.‚Äù And that applies to many kinds of hardware wallets, not just Ledger.  But boy oh boy, is ‚Äúyou have always trusted Ledger not to steal all your money‚Äù not the right way to phrase that. Despite being broadly accurate, the message added immensely to the confusion, fueling even more panicky rhetoric on Twitter ‚Äì including claims that Ledger devices have been revealed to have some deep flaw or ‚Äúback door.‚Äù  See also: Ledger Bats Back Criticism of New Wallet Recovery Service  The offending comment seems to simultaneously affirm all of the worst fears being floated ‚Äì and also belittle the worriers for not catching on sooner. Regardless of intent, both ‚Äútechnically speaking‚Äù and ‚Äúwhether you knew it or not‚Äù will be heard as condescending, even dismissive. ‚ÄúYes we can do the thing you‚Äôre most worried about, but you shouldn‚Äôt be worried about it because we could always do it, and you‚Äôre kind of dumb for not already realizing that‚Äù is not a way to calm anybody down.  One way of thinking about this unfortunate drama is that language is not like computer code  (A note on responsibility here: If they were indeed a rank-and-file customer service rep, whoever wrote this tweet should not have felt empowered or responsible to make such a broad statement at all. True culpability for the misstep lies further up the chain of command.)  Even worse, the message commits a sin that we in journalism call ‚Äúburying the lede.‚Äù A second tweet, threaded onto the ‚Äútechnically speaking‚Äù post, emphasized that every update has to be manually approved by the user. This is the core of Ledger‚Äôs rebuttal of the ongoing attacks against it.  You can still use a Ledger  While the technical nuances are beyond my scope here, some extremely trustworthy experts have rebutted the most extreme worries circulating about Ledger.  Most significantly, Taylor Monahan, founder of the MyCrypto wallet and now part of the Metamask team, has vigorously condemned the worries about Ledger as ‚Äúsensationalist bullshit.‚Äù Haseeb Qureshi of Dragonfly Capital also notably walked back his initial concerns, writing ‚Äúnow I‚Äôm in the ‚Äònvm it‚Äôs fine‚Äô‚Äù camp.  It‚Äôs too soon to completely sign off on the idea that everything is fine, but the main misunderstanding is clear. A hardware wallet needs an updatable operating system (OS), including so it can add support for new tokens and chains. So users have to allow updates at some point, and most Ledger users have likely gotten an update or two before the current controversy popped off.  That is, they‚Äôve trusted Ledger, whether they knew it or not. The fact that an update would be used to implement a recovery scheme was what finally drew attention to the process. The alternative isn‚Äôt to buy a different hardware wallet, but to store your seed phrase on a piece of paper in a safe.  See also: Brainwallets: The Bitcoin Wallet You Probably Shouldn't Use  The one ding on Ledger that does seem valid is that these updates, and the Ledger code, are not open source, while many other hardware wallets‚Äô code is. This genuinely makes the trust placed in Ledger even higher than with other wallets. But this real question has become muddled with a lot of off-base and ill-informed speculation, and Ledger has so far failed to quell either the real concerns or the mistaken ones.  One way of thinking about this unfortunate drama is that language is not like computer code. If you‚Äôre writing a smart contract or a physics engine, you can construct the same function a half dozen different ways with little functional difference. When you‚Äôre writing a tweet, by contrast, tiny variations matter immensely to how it will be received. It‚Äôs art, not science ‚Äì and the gap between the two is only going to grow wider as more and more average folks adopt crypto.",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TRADING | WALLET,David Z.

42410715,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdgHAS,1684516697,Why Web3 and the AI-Internet Belong Together,"A tweet this week from Chris Frantz, the founder of email platform Loops, irked me.  Frantz said ‚Äú90% of the people I know in web3 have pivoted their company to AI.‚Äù  What got to me was not that founders are so obsessed with securing venture capital that they‚Äôll glob onto the next ‚Äúin‚Äù thing. (Let‚Äôs save that problem of Silicon Valley fickleness for another time.) It was that people see the various elements of the complex new digital economy forming around us ‚Äì artificial intelligence, blockchain, the metaverse, programmable money, digital identity, cryptographic proofs, quantum computing, IoT and so forth ‚Äì as unrelated, exchangeable pieces, when they‚Äôre really intertwined and complementary.  You‚Äôre reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  AI will need Web3, and vice versa. Why not build both?  I see this harmful, reductionist simplification of ‚ÄúWeb3,‚Äù ‚Äúblockchain‚Äù and ‚Äúcrypto‚Äù stemming from a fundamental failure to identify the core, unifying feature of all projects that end up under those labels. To me, the commonality is that they all use a novel system of distributed record-keeping and incentives to deal with the basic problem of human trust around information. These technologies help communities of mistrusting strangers collectively maintain open data records that allow them to distribute and share valuable (or sensitive) information among themselves without the intermediation of middlemen.  In addressing how to keep valuable information secure in a decentralized environment, Web3, crypto and blockchain address a societal challenge that has been with us since the start of the internet. But, now, in the age of AI, when uncertainty over information is going to go stratospheric, it‚Äôs an even more urgent matter.  Original misconceptions  So why do people ‚Äì whether they‚Äôre founders flipping from one fad to the next, or policymakers who think crypto is just for money-laundering ‚Äì not comprehend the all-encompassing importance of this new data architecture?  At the risk of being sacreligious, I think it goes back to cryptocurrency's roots, with the founding of Bitcoin.  Back then, the messaging should have been about information, about sharing data, about protecting privacy ‚Äì in essence, the primary concerns of the cypherpunks whose mailing list Satoshi Nakamoto used to unveil the Bitcoin white paper in October 2008.  Now, I‚Äôm not really blaming Satoshi here. The founder was simply offering up one of a number of information solutions that the cypherpunks had ruminated on for years: a cryptography-based digital currency. Satoshi knew that, while money is special in terms of its fundamental importance to society, it is really just another form of information.  Money isn‚Äôt a thing. It‚Äôs a standardized, commonly agreed-upon symbolic representation of value. It‚Äôs a particular type of information that, because it is highly valued, requires an elaborate, institutionalized system to instill confidence that people and entities won‚Äôt abuse it. But it is far from the only type of information that carries value and which, by extension, requires institutional coordination. That‚Äôs why Bitcoin was, to me, a prototype for a much bigger idea.  There were, of course, many early Bitcoin believers, including Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, who got it. They recognized that this decentralized data architecture could be applied to the myriad problems we face in sharing valuable information in the digital age.  The problem was that in the general public‚Äôs eye, as well as those of regulators who wished to jam this strange square peg into the round hole of traditional finance, cryptocurrencies and blockchains were purely about money.  Setbacks  That misunderstanding has set us back, perpetuating a Web2 structure of harmful data manipulation by giant internet platforms that have sown mistrust in our information systems and democracy. If a broader understanding of the potential had existed, this industry would have addressed its inherent scaling, legal and privacy challenges more readily. Maybe there‚Äôd have been less of an instinct toward scams and ‚Äúnumber go up‚Äù token casinos, and more drive to build meaningful solutions to the world‚Äôs problems.  But, now? Now, in the age of artificial intelligence, this misunderstanding gets downright dangerous.  Please don‚Äôt accuse me of naive ‚Äúblockchain fixes this‚Äù hand-waving. The challenges of the AI moment are daunting, from protecting copyright in the inputs of large language models (LLMs), to avoiding racial bias in their outputs, to the ‚Äúliar‚Äôs dividend‚Äù fostered by our current inability to distinguish between real content and AI-created fabrications. There is no easy way to save humanity from the machines. Whatever solution arises will inevitably draw on a wide range of technologies and policies.  Here‚Äôs what I do know: we are not going to resolve these matters with an outdated 20th-century regulation-technology stack. We need a decentralized governance system for how we produce, verify, and share information in this new era.  How it can help  Whether or not, as currently designed, they can deliver what‚Äôs needed, blockchains do have qualities that can help.  Immutable ledgers allow us to track the provenance of images and other content and so could protect against deep fakes. The same might apply to testing the integrity of the datasets on which machine learning AI products are trained. Cryptocurrencies could be used to pay people worldwide, in a borderless digital manner, for their contributions to AI training. Projects such Bittensor are building tokenized, blockchain-government communities that incentivize AI developers to build human-friendly models (addressing the concern that AI systems owned by private corporations are incentivized to put the profits of shareholders over the rights of users.)  There‚Äôs a long way to go before these ideas can deliver on this promise at the scale that‚Äôs needed, if they ever will. Also, success will require the integration of a range of other technologies ‚Äì zero-knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption, secure computing, digital identities and decentralized credentials, IoT ‚Äì as well as smart, multi-stakeholder legislation that protects privacy, punishes bad behavior and encourages human-centric innovation.  But to position Web3, blockchain, crypto, or whatever you want to call it, as a has-been with no place in the emerging digital future is to severely mis-comprehend the problem at hand.",NEUTRAL,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | REGULATION | BITTENSOR,Michael J.

12778475,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=534056,1684515556,XRP Ledger On Fire: Daily Transactions Skyrocket 10.7% In Q1 2023,"According to the latest report by the research firm, Messari, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) saw a significant surge in activity during the first quarter of 2023. The daily active addresses and daily transactions increased by 13.9% and 10.7% QoQ, respectively. XRP‚Äôs price also showed an impressive increase of 56% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ), from $0.35 to $0.54. This price increase outpaced the total crypto market cap in the same period, largely due to positive news regarding the ongoing case between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Related Reading: Shiba Inu Sees Juicy Capital Inflows ‚Äì An Imminent Rebound in Sight? XRP Ledger Network Activity Soars The XRP Ledger is a blockchain network operational for over a decade. It is known for its fast and energy-efficient cross-border payment capabilities, among other features. It offers a variety of native capabilities, including Issued Currencies, a decentralized exchange, escrow functionality, and token management. These features allow the XRPL to execute many of the same functions as other networks, even though it does not support smart contracts. The chart above shows that the XRPL has seen a significant increase in overall network activity metrics in Q1. Daily active addresses and transactions increased by 13.9% and 10.7%, respectively. The increase in total active addresses was largely due to receiving addresses growing by 17.1% from 47,000 to 55,000. However, sending addresses decreased by 7.2% QoQ, further separating the metric from receiving addresses. Despite 141,000 accounts being deleted in Q1, the total addresses increased. This is because, unlike many other blockchain networks, the XRPL allows accounts to be deleted to reclaim the deposit of XRP escrowed during account creation. This escrow incentivizes to delete of accounts, and the total address metric has more significance. According to the report, the XRPL applies deflationary pressure to the total supply of 100 billion XRP through transaction fee burning. However, only around 10 million XRP have been burned since the XRPL‚Äôs inception. To counteract this burn rate, 1 billion XRP vests to Ripple per month. Any XRP not spent or distributed by Ripple in that month is returned to escrow. This system will continue until the remaining 48 billion XRP become liquid. Unlike many other cryptocurrency networks, the XRPL does not distribute rewards or transaction fees to validators. Instead, validators are incentivized by supporting the decentralization of the network. This is similar to a full node for Ethereum/Bitcoin rather than a validator/miner. NFT Market Adapts To XLS-20 Standard The XRPL standardized NFTs on its network with the XLS-20 standard, enabled in October 2022. Five new transaction types were created to track all NFT activity on the network accurately. However, NFT mints declined 40.4% QoQ, from 732,000 in Q4 to 436,000 in Q1, while NFT offers accepted declined 25.1% QoQ, from 370,000 in Q4 to 277,000 in Q1. Furthermore, in NFT sales volume, XPUNKS remained the all-time leader with 15.7 million XRP ($8.5 million as of Q1). However, Core Apes Club and RipplePunks rivaled XPUNKS in sales volume in Q1, with each collection doing 400,000-500,000 XRP in quarterly volume. RipplePunks averaged 141,000 XRP ($76,000) in monthly sales volume and 960 monthly sales in Q1. Related Reading: Lido‚Äôs ETH Deposits Reach Record High Amid Stagnant stETH Withdrawals Overall, the XRPL‚Äôs deflationary mechanism of burned transaction fees and focus on decentralization and trust between nodes through unique node lists are key factors in its success.

42420403,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpfXp,1684512300,To Axie Infinity and Beyond,"This week, Axie Infinity announced the launch of its card-based strategy game Axie Infinity: Origins on the Apple App Store in some of its biggest markets across Asia and Latin America, giving its native AXS token a brief bump.  Plus, Jack Butcher released a new NFT collection called Elements that are paired with physical prints, and DappRadar released a new report predicting that NFT trading volume is on track to dip below $1 billion for the first time this year. But how important is NFT trading volume anyway?  You‚Äôre reading The Airdrop, our weekly newsletter where we discuss the biggest stories across Web3. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday.  This Week's Alpha  Axie‚Äôs App Store debut: Popular NFT gaming project Axie Infinity launched its card-based strategy game Axie Infinity: Origins on the Apple App Store across its key markets in Latin America and Asia. The game was previously available in limited regions on the Google Play store and through the company's Mavis Hub. People can start playing with free non-NFT ""starter"" characters and the game currently has 1.5 million installs across all platforms.  AXS surge: Axie Infinity's native cryptocurrency AXS jumped over 12% from $7.16 to $8.04 after the news was reported, becoming the top gainer on CoinDesk Indices' leaderboard. The bump didn‚Äôt last however and the token is trading at just under $7 as of writing.  The fifth element: Artist Jack Butcher has released another NFT collection called Checks Elements that expands his popular Checks ecosystem with physical prints. The new 152-piece generative art collection explores the four classical elements of earth, fire, water and air and uses his signature Checks motifs and grid. Each NFT in the collection comes with a paired monoprint. Part of the collection is currently being offered at auction through Christie‚Äôs.  Consensus of truth: Butcher told me that Checks Elements explores the ""ever-evolving relationship between consensus and truth.""  NFT and physical pairs: A burn mechanism was not built into the project, meaning that the physical prints and NFTs can be sold separately. However, Butcher said that in the long-term, the idea is for the NFTs to ‚Äúexist as pairs that sit together as a complement to the existing checks ecosystem.""  Should we care about NFT trading volume? A new report by DappRadar released on Thursday said that NFT trading volume was on track to dip below $1 billion for the first time this year and is lagging behind last month‚Äôs numbers. In contrast, there have been 2.3 million sales executed so far this month and a notable increase in the number of weekly active wallets interacting with NFTs.  What does this mean? Sara Gherghelas, a blockchain analyst at DappRadar, told me that these numbers may signal that there are more NFT traders in the market making smaller dollar-figure trades.  Trading volume metric: Trading volume remains an important metric for measuring activity in the NFT market, though it has the potential to be manipulated by wash trading and transactions done by a small number of ultra-wealthy traders. Overall, the metric remains a useful indicator of trader behavior but should be considered in the context of the current market.  Projects on the Rise  The Memes by 6529  Who: @punk6529  What: Created in June 2022, pseudonymous Twitter personality and NFT collector Punk 6529 has been steadily releasing a collection of art NFTs based that references pop culture and memes. The collection, divided into three ‚Äúseasons,‚Äù has released 99 ERC-1155 token editions, resulting in about 77,000 total NFTs minted as part of the collection. At the time of writing, the collection has done 20,347 ETH in total volume (nearly $37 million), according to OpenSea. According to the 6529 website, the Memes collection ‚Äúis focused on the fight for the open metaverse‚Äù and has been created by a number of artists.  Why: The project recently received some buzz after Gregory Schneider, deputy general counsel for Hedera, created a tool that allows people to add ‚ÄúMeet Summer Glasses,‚Äù a collectible created in the first season, to any image. The meme and its underlying asset are CC0, which means that anyone can remix the image.  In Other News  Higher standards: ERC-721C, a proposal to put NFT royalties on-chain to avoid marketplaces like Blur from dropping creator royalties to zero, picked up steam this week, alongside another draft proposal called ERC-6551, which would allow NFTs to be used as a ‚Äúholding identity‚Äù rather than a single asset.

Instead of the metadata of the token pointing to an external file, the whole artwork (or video or music file, etc.) is kept on-chain and is kept in the witness signature field of Bitcoin transactions.  Recently, tokens on Bitcoin have taken the crypto world by storm because of a new proposal called BRC-20, modeled and named after ERC-20, which uses the same ordinals inscription back-end as the NFTs. But while the naming is similar, there are no smart contracts and they are currently not listed on most exchanges.

42420398,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpfQb,1684511571,Beyond the JPEG: Web3 Is Expanding the Artist's Canvas Through Immersive IRL Experiences,"On May 5, thousands of people packed the streets surrounding renowned architect Antoni Gaud√≠‚Äôs Casa Batll√≥ in Barcelona, Spain. It wasn‚Äôt the typical horde of tourists though ‚Äì viewers from near and far gathered to experience digital artist Refik Anadol‚Äôs dynamic work projected onto the facade of the UNESCO World Heritage Site.  The ten-minute video mapping of Anadol‚Äôs generative non-fungible token (NFT) artwork ‚ÄúLiving Architecture‚Äù captivated the crowd as colors, lights and sounds made the building feel alive. The work had debuted as a projection on Casa Batll√≥ the year before, but the draw of seeing the work in person brought in tens of thousands of new viewers across five showings that evening.  The show left an impression on its audience in a way that extended beyond its colorful visuals. The emotional reaction of the sensory spectacle came from the sheer number of attendees ‚Äì both Web3-native and those entirely unfamiliar with crypto ‚Äì who showed up to watch a public display of on-chain art together.  There are many barriers to entry into NFT and digital art creation. Just setting up a wallet and funding it with cryptocurrency is enough to turn away most newcomers before they even attempt to buy or sell an NFT artwork. Instead of trying to onboard the masses through complex technology, many in Web3 are refocusing the conversation to be about the art itself and are creating delightful experiences that welcome exploration.  ‚ÄúYou need to show art that is absolutely, positively worthwhile when taking a passerby's attention. It is not about converting the museum-goer, but rather the office commuter on a tight schedule,‚Äù AC, head of generative art at the 6529 NFT Fund (which owns the ‚ÄúLiving Architecture‚Äù NFT) told CoinDesk. ‚ÄúDigital and multimedia art have the ability to entrance a viewer where a canvas may be physically constrained, and that is how you bring people into NFTs.‚Äù  Manager of digital art sales at Christie‚Äôs Sebastian Sanchez told CoinDesk that digital art calls for flexibility and invites artists to be creative about how they display their work and engage with their audience.  ‚ÄúArtists may have instructions on how they want to display their art, but you can put it on a projector, you can put it on the screen, you can print it, you can put it on your computer‚Ä¶ there are infinite ways to display digital art, which I think is the exciting part and sort of lends itself to this fluid nature,‚Äù said Sanchez.  Expanding the dimensions of digital art  Susannah Maybank, CEO of digital art marketplace Tonic, noticed a core problem in her early days of founding her Web3-native company: The growing appetite for NFT art was missing a real-life component.  ‚ÄúWe began with a lot of customer research of figuring out what were their priorities, what were they hesitant about?‚Äù Maybank told CoinDesk. ‚ÄúAnd that utility of display was a recurring theme where people really valued the ability to live and appreciate the art in their homes and in their lives.‚Äù  When a collector purchases an NFT from Tonic, they also receive a physical derivative of the work to own and display IRL. Maybank said this consumer model encourages more collectors to appreciate the art rather than simply collect it for its market value or promised utility.  ‚ÄúWhen looking at something on a screen with a 12-inch MacBook, you lose so much and it‚Äôs such a pale experience,‚Äù said Maybank. ‚ÄúWhen you're in a room with people, you feel the energy, you're able to meet the artist and that‚Äôs when you get to really experience the work as it was intended.‚Äù  J. Douglass Kobs, CEO and founder of digital art marketplace and residency program Wild, told CoinDesk that its mission is to expand opportunities for art collectors by creating experiences that transcend physical boundaries.  Wild is building out its Wildverse, an art-oriented metaverse that aims to bring communities together in a digital space where they can discuss their work, view their counterparts‚Äô creations and learn how to build on-chain art collections. Kobs said Wildverse also aims to help onboard new users, ‚Äúwelcoming people with open arms‚Äù as they explore new mediums for creating art.  ‚ÄúI really felt like if we could start to engage more senses, then you're able to connect with people in a very different way as an artist because you're trying to build an emotional connection and you're trying to convey a message,‚Äù said Kobs. ‚ÄúMy top priority is not ‚Äòhow can I print this and put it on my wall?‚Äô but rather ‚Äòhow can I enable artists to connect with their collectors in ways that weren't possible before?‚Äô‚Äù  Galleries are paving new pathways for collectors  As creators and collectors continue to find new ways to make on-chain art more accessible, museums and galleries around the world have slowly started to embrace digitally-native art collections.  In December, NFT giant Yuga Labs kicked off its Punks Legacy Project, an initiative to donate CryptoPunks NFTs ‚Äì one of the first NFT collections ever on the Ethereum blockchain ‚Äì to museums around the world. It has donated Punks to The Institute of Contemporary Art in Miami and the Paris‚Äô Centre Pompidou museum so far. NFT collector Cozomo de‚Äô Medici also donated 22 digital artworks to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art from their personal collection.  In March, generative artist Tyler Hobbs held New York-based Pace Gallery‚Äôs first Web3 solo exhibition featuring physical derivatives from his popular QQL NFT collection. And since November 2022, Refik Anadol‚Äôs ‚ÄúUnsupervised‚Äù digital artwork has been on display on the first floor of New York‚Äôs Museum of Modern Art.  Beyond viewing digital art in galleries, startups like Bright Moments are allowing collectors to be a part of the art creation process.  Bright Moments has physical gallery locations in Berlin, London, Mexico City, New York, Venice and Tokyo, and holds in-person events year-round across its six locations. It also has its own NFT collection, CryptoCitizens, which grants holders access to the Bright Moments DAO ‚Äî a decentralized community that can vote to decide which Bright Moments location hosts its next event.  Read More: Art Blocks and NFT Gallery Bright Moments Team Up to Bring Generative Art IRL  Brougkr, a full-stack engineer at Bright Moments, told CoinDesk that a unique part of each Bright Moments event is that the artists and collectors get to stand in the same room to watch their NFT be minted and the art be created for the first time.  ‚ÄúThat is such a beautiful moment to be able to see unfold in real-time, seeing the culmination of an artist's work and all the time and energy they put into their algorithm to create the collection,‚Äù said Brougkr.  Christie‚Äôs Sebastian Sanchez said that while NFT art attracts Web3-native buyers, more ‚Äútraditional‚Äù art collectors are beginning to see real value in the space.  ‚ÄúThe majority of people who walk through our halls and galleries in New York are ‚Äòtraditional‚Äô clients, so those are non-NFT people seeing this art for the first time, and I think that's great,"" he said. ‚ÄúThe value for digital art is almost equally the idea of owning it and equally the idea of loving it.""  Creating for cultural evolution  Andre O‚ÄôShea, an NFT artist and animator that uses artificial intelligence (AI) in his practice, told CoinDesk that the definition of art is continuing to evolve through NFTs.  ‚ÄúI grew up seeing film, TV and animation as art. So when I see NFTs and digital art becoming more popular to display, it feels like a natural progression,‚Äù said O‚ÄôShea. ‚ÄúOur world is increasingly digital so our art should be as well.‚Äù  Auguste Wibo, a pseudonymous NFT artist who has participated in the Wild residency program, told CoinDesk that art has historically reflected the cultural zeitgeist, which now demands NFT representation. When experiencing art, he believes the context is just as important as the content.  ‚ÄúMuseums have a responsibility to tell these stories,‚Äù said Wibo. ‚ÄúWhether it‚Äôs AI or the algorithms behind these new pieces that galleries are showcasing, they reflect our times and it will be very interesting to observe in context with pieces from the past.‚Äù  And similar to expensive pieces of fine art that are hidden away from the public, Wibo noted the importance of pulling rare NFTs out from digital storage spaces, inviting everyone ‚Äì not just the ultra-wealthy ‚Äì to experience them.  ‚ÄúIt's not only expensive NFTs that are kept behind closed doors ‚Äì very expensive physical art will probably never be seen by the public and only enjoyed by private collectors or institutes,‚Äù said Wibo. ‚ÄúThere is a long way to go for both mediums to be considered equal so it‚Äôs important to push digital art in front of non-crypto natives to educate viewers.‚Äù",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/05/19/beyond-the-jpeg-web3-is-expanding-the-artists-canvas-through-immersive-irl-experiences,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1369b0abcf8371a3fca44339b4b26873aa94ecfa-1600x1067.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The collection of technologies includes tamper-proof, self-owned identifiers similar to email addresses or usernames called decentralized identifiers (DIDs); secure digital certificates called verified credentials (VCs) that provide legal proof of things like name, age and ownership of assets; and decentralized web nodes (DWNs) that store data in a decentralized way.  The full Web5 platform is expected to launch later in 2023, but with this initial release, developers can start building decentralized applications on TBD‚Äôs developer platform.  ‚ÄúWe're at Bitcoin Miami right now.

12775581,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=534035,1684506649,Lido‚Äôs ETH Deposits Reach Record High Amid Stagnant stETH Withdrawals,"Lido (LDO), the leading liquid staking derivatives (LSD) protocol, recently made waves in the crypto community by enabling staked ETH (stETH) withdrawals. Expectations were high as many anticipated a surge in stakers unstaking their ETH. However, contrary to these predictions, Lido has witnessed a remarkable increase in ETH deposits, reaching a record-breaking level. This surge has also been reflected in the protocol‚Äôs native token which has recorded a rally of more than 20% in the past week. Related Reading: Lido (LDO) Surges 16% In Single Day, Maintains Dominance In Liquid Staking Market ETH Deposits Soar to New All-Time High Despite the introduction of stETH withdrawals, Lido experienced a surge in ETH deposits, defying expectations of widespread unstaking. On Friday, the platform witnessed a significant milestone as the total number of ETH deposited hit an all-time high. According to data provided by Lido, an astounding 6,373,289 ETH is currently staked with Lido, equivalent to more than $11.5 billion. Interestingly, while ETH deposits on Lido continue to soar, stETH withdrawals have remained stagnant around the 450,000 ETH mark, as reported by data from Nansen. It is worth noting that these withdrawal requests have yet to be processed, contributing to the overall stability of stETH withdrawals. This trend raises questions about the anticipated unstaking frenzy, prompting a closer examination of the factors influencing stakers‚Äô decisions. As the most significant liquid staking derivatives protocol, Lido holds an impressive 75% market share, surpassing its competitors in the Liquid staking (LSD) space. Notably, according to data from Nansen, Coinbase and Rocket Pool trail behind, occupying the second and third positions. Furthermore, while it may sound like positive news that ETH deposit is surging while withdrawal flattens, it is worth noting there are several reasons behind this so as not to get carried away. On the one side, the stabilized withdrawal can be attributed to the pending processing of withdrawal requests. On the other side, it can be attributed to¬†stakers‚Äô long-term commitment to the protocol and the attractiveness of Lido‚Äôs offerings amidst the volatile crypto landscape. Lido Surges 20% In The Past Week Along with its surge in market share, Lido native¬†token LDO‚Äôs price has experienced an upward trend¬†in the past week up by more than 20%. Lido has surged from a low of $1.81 seen last Friday to trading as high as $2.48 on Wednesday.

42420401,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpfUj,1684503653,Is Ledger‚Äôs New Bitcoin Key Recovery Feature Safe? Experts Have Doubts,"When Ledger, a Paris-based hardware wallet-maker, announced a new key-recovery feature this week, it thought the move would be popular.  Allowing users to recover their private keys ‚Äì much like you can recover your password if you forget it ‚Äì would help onboard customers, the company believed. Potential crypto users are known to be turned off by crypto's unforgiving self-custody ethos (""not your keys, not your coins""). But a key recovery service would offer more comfort.  Immediately, the launch of ""Ledger Recover"" provoked criticism.  Opponents say that the product isn‚Äôt compatible with the concept of a hardware wallet, which promises to ring-fence private keys from prying eyes.  ""For a hardware wallet to transmit the seed or shares that can reconstruct the seed over the internet fundamentally alters the security threat model of a hardware wallet,"" said Pavol Rusnak, co-founder of SatoshiLabs, which makes a competing hardware wallet Trezor. ‚ÄúIn fact, this change is so significant that I'm not convinced it's a viable solution for a hardware wallet at all.""  The opt-in update, available for Nano X models, allows Ledger owners to use a service named Ledger Recover and share their seed phrase (a sequence of words used to recover a lost wallet) with a set of trusted custodians, namely Ledger, Coincover and EscrowTech. They will store users‚Äô encrypted backups for a monthly fee.  According to the company, this allows users to restore access to their crypto if they forget or lose their seed phrases. By using the service, they would be able to ask Ledger for help, prove their identity and get their private key restored for them.  The critics worry that both the firmware update and the whole recovery setup does not look safe. Ledger insists that things are secure as ever.  CoinDesk looked into how the new feature is supposed to work (as described by Ledger itself) and asked experts what the potential security concerns here may be.  Ledger explains  According to Philip Costigan, Ledger communications lead, the new feature does not mean the device itself communicates with custodians over the internet, as the Ledger wallets themselves ‚Äúhave no WiFi or any other internet connection capability.‚Äù  To transfer encrypted parts of the seed to custodians, users need to connect their Ledger wallet to their phone with a Ledger app via Bluetooth, Costigan said. The same mechanism is used for approving transactions, when Ledger owners want to spend crypto from their wallets.  Here is how Costigan explains the process: First, users verify their identity with Onfido and Tessi, the two providers Ledger employed for this task, via Ledger‚Äôs mobile app.  ‚ÄúLedger, Coincover and EscrowTech don't review or hold people's IDs, it's done by the technology of the two providers I mentioned above who are experts here,‚Äù Costigan said.  After that, the Ledger device gets a prompt to create a backup. Then a backup is created, encrypted, divided into shards using the Shamir‚Äôs Secret Sharing technique and transferred to Ledger, Coincover and EscrowTech, Costigan said. Each custodian gets to keep one shard, which are useless on their own.  ‚ÄúAll encryption, fragmentation, and decryption of your secret recovery phrase happens on your Ledger on the secure element. So the only thing that leaves the secure element chip, and only after your consent, are the encrypted shards,‚Äù he added.  Costigan also underscored that the hardware wallet itself does not store any user‚Äôs identity information on it.  When a user requires a recovery, any two out of three custodians will ‚Äúsend fragments back to your Ledger device, reassembling them to build your private key,‚Äù the FAQ page on Ledger website says.  Security concerns  The news of the update provoked a storm of criticism from the crypto community, with accusations that Ledger‚Äôs new offering contradicts its past statements about keeping private keys off the internet.  In particular, Crypto Twitter piled on the tweet Ledger‚Äôs official account posted in November, assuring users of the safety of their devices.  ‚ÄúHow can you prove to us the customers that the private keys on the device are not leakable via a firmware update in case someone at the company wants this?‚Äù a Twitter user known as @S_Radude asked on Nov. 15, 2022.  ‚ÄúHi - your private keys never leave the Secure Element chip, which has never been hacked. The Secure Element is 3rd party certified, and is the same technology as used in passports and credit cards. A firmware update cannot extract the private keys from the Secure Element,‚Äù Ledger responded.  Users pointed out that the new update does almost exactly what Ledger said they wouldn‚Äôt do. There is a caveat: during the recovery process, as Ledger describes it, it‚Äôs not the private key itself that is getting extracted but the seed phrase encoding it.  This still sent a worrying signal to the users: what they considered safely stored in a little citadel of their hardware wallet now can leave it and travel elsewhere. What if Ledger decided to just extract and collect users‚Äô seed phrases, without any protection?  ‚ÄúIf you can update the firmware to instruct the ‚ÄòSecure Element‚Äô to encrypt, shard, and distribute the seed, what stops you from updating the firmware next week to just extract the unencrypted seed,‚Äù user @NewWageCrypto asked.  ‚ÄúTechnically speaking it is and always has been possible to write firmware that facilitates key extraction. You have always trusted Ledger not to deploy such firmware whether you knew it or not,‚Äù Ledger responded on Wednesday in a tweet that has since been deleted.  But the archived copy of the thread shows that the tweet, which immediately triggered a new wave of outrage, was followed by a clarification: for any update to happen, users must manually approve it.  ‚ÄúEvery firmware update requires a PIN unlock device approval, this is the final line that makes it impossible for us to extract your keys even if we had your device,‚Äù another now deleted tweet from the company said.  However, the questions still linger: what does Ledger‚Äôs firmware actually can do and can users still trust their devices?  Crypto developer and researcher Laurence E. Day told CoinDesk that the core of a problem here is that Ledger‚Äôs code is closed source, so nobody can review what the update is actually doing. Blockchain security expert Christopher Allen shared similar considerations on Twitter.  ‚ÄúOne of my concerns with the new Ledger Recover service is that they appear to be sharding via Shamir‚Äôs Secret Sharing, but doing so in a proprietary way and possibly in a naive fashion. We don‚Äôt know, as it is not open source,‚Äù Allen tweeted.  Looking for Attack Surfaces  For Day, the most worrying part of the situation is an apparent breach of trust between Ledger and its users, triggered by the contradictions in the firm‚Äôs statements.  ‚Äú‚Äã‚ÄãI guess the thing that bugs me here is that there‚Äôs this breach of a covenant that seeds would never leave the secure element chip, even though it‚Äôs always been possible to do that through firmware (and this remains an option for other hardware wallet suppliers too),‚Äù Day told CoinDesk via direct messages in Twitter.  Another issue has to do with privacy. Hardware wallets are typically viewed as a way to store your crypto anonymously, without attaching your name to it.  However, users who opt in for the Recover update will have their identities linked to their crypto wallets, making the experience closer to using a centralized exchange with know-your-customer (KYC) checks.  Head of content for another competitor hardware wallet maker Foundation, going by the nickname Seth For Privacy, tweeted that a setup Ledger is offering means a whole set of concerns for users, including ‚Äúdata leaks, hacks, and government censorship or surveillance.‚Äù  ‚ÄúNot only can leaks or hacks occur, the sales of data on users of Ledger would be extremely valuable now and in the future, and any of the ‚Äòauthorized third parties‚Äô could decide to leverage your data as an income stream at any moment,‚Äù he wrote.  If, in the future, hackers breach Onfido or Tessi, they might get a list of Ledger users, who are likely to own large amounts of crypto (the wallet itself costs about $150 to buy), along with a wealth of their personal data, Seth added.  Ledger has been breached in the past: in July 2020, information of 272,000 users was stolen from the firm, with a series of phishing attacks on users following that breach.  Law enforcement agencies, too, might use the setup to get access to Ledger users‚Äô crypto, Day said: ‚ÄúThe three organizations that will hold the shards are known, so they‚Äôre liable to get a visit from the feds ‚Äì so you could argue that by enabling Recover you‚Äôre turning your wallet hot even if there are legal steps in between,‚Äù he said. (In crypto terms, ‚Äúhot‚Äù wallets are connected to the internet, ‚Äúcold‚Äù are not.)  There is also a danger that, however secure the offered setup is, any system can be gamed, SatoshiLabs‚Äô Rusnak said: ‚ÄúThere's always the risk that someone could use generative AI technologies to impersonate me, obtain my seed shares, and ultimately reconstruct my seed.‚Äù  Some commentators on Twitter also voiced concerns that while the feature is optional now, in the future, Ledger might make it obligatory for all devices, for regulatory reasons or else.  Against the Crypto Ethos  Using trusted custodians is nothing new for crypto ‚Äì in fact, everyone who keeps their coins on an exchange is trusting the exchange like it‚Äôs a bank. But hardware wallets embody the ‚Äúbe your own bank‚Äù ethos of Bitcoin: that you don‚Äôt have to trust an intermediary to keep your money safe.  Read also: Air Gap? Hardware Wallet? Multisig? Bitcoin Self-Storage Means Hard Choices  This means keeping the keys to your crypto on a device that only you control, preferably disconnected from the internet, to avoid the risk of hacking. But this approach requires self-discipline that might feel excessively burdensome to many people. Ledger‚Äôs new service attempts to give users some peace of mind, allowing them to recover lost crypto wallets like they would recover stolen credit cards or forgotten passwords (although in a much more sophisticated fashion).  In this sense, Ledger Recover is a kind of compromise between the autonomy of cold storage and the comfort of custodial one: your crypto is on your device, but if you lose it, there is someone to restore it for you. The question is, do Ledger users want that compromise?  ‚ÄúI get the point of why you'd want to offer Recover as a U.X. improvement to mom and pop, but it just feels like a comms screw-up: mom and pop aren't using these devices anyway,‚Äù Day said, adding that hardware wallets users are by default a more sophisticated public.  Read also: Ledger Bats Back Criticism of New Wallet Recovery Service  Ledger, however, believes that moms and pops might just not know they want it yet.  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre saying this is not what customers want. Actually, this is what future customers want,‚Äù Ledger CEO Pascal Gauthier said during a Twitter Spaces session on Tuesday. ‚ÄúThis is the way that the next hundreds of millions of people will actually onboard to crypto.‚Äù",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/05/19/is-ledgers-new-bitcoin-key-recovery-feature-safe-experts-have-doubts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/791045cc1c77972a32359eba2029c807da16be2f-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
12774561,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=533988,1684503402,"Bitcoin Plunges Below $27,000 As Miners Show Signs Of Selling","Bitcoin has now dipped below the $27,000 level as on-chain data shows the miners have possibly been selling the asset recently. Bitcoin Miner Reserve Has Taken A Sharp Plummet Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, miners have taken out about 1,750 BTC from their wallets during the past day. The relevant indicator here is the ‚Äúminer outflow,‚Äù which measures the total amount of Bitcoin that miners are transferring out of their wallets currently. The counterpart metric of the outflow is called the ‚Äúinflow,‚Äù and it naturally tracks the total number of coins going into the addresses of these blockchain validators. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin miner outflow, as well as the inflow, over the last few weeks: Looks like the value of the outflow has been pretty high in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant Whenever the miner inflow has a high value, it means that this cohort is depositing a large amount of Bitcoin into their wallets. Such a trend, when prolonged, can be a sign that the miners are accumulating right now. Naturally, this can have bullish implications for the price. When the outflow is high, on the other hand, it suggests that a large amount of the asset is exiting from the supply of the miners. Generally, the main reason why these holders transfer their coins out of their wallets is for selling-related purposes, so this kind of trend can be bearish for the cryptocurrency‚Äôs value. In the above graph, it‚Äôs visible that the miner inflow has been at relatively low values during the past day, implying that these investors aren‚Äôt depositing any significant amounts to their wallets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Binary CDD Stays Low, Here‚Äôs What This Means The miner outflow, however, has registered a pretty high spike in the same period. In total, around 1,750 BTC ($47 million) has exited the supply of the miners with this surge in the indicator. Since there haven‚Äôt been any inflows to counteract these outflows, a net amount of the asset has now left the miners‚Äô wallets. This would mean that if the outflows were made for selling purposes, a net bearish effect should appear on the price. An indicator that helps better identify whether these transfers were for selling or not is the ‚Äúminer to exchange flow,‚Äù which tracks only the miner outflows heading towards centralized exchanges. Usually, this cohort uses the exchanges when they want to take part in distribution. As shown in the above chart, however, the metric has remained low recently, meaning that these outflows haven‚Äôt directly entered into the wallets of these platforms. Though, the quant has discovered that the destination wallet of the 1,750 miner outflow made another transfer, which was indeed towards an exchange. ‚ÄúThere is a high probability that 1,750 BTC ultimately went to Binance,‚Äù explains the analyst. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Support Line Is Still Active, Bullish Signal? When these outflows took place yesterday, Bitcoin was above the $27,000 level. Following them, however, the asset has observed a plunge and is now below this mark, suggesting that this latest selling pressure from the miners may have been behind the decline.

It‚Äôs no secret that Coinbase is currently at loggerheads with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has warned the exchange that its going to be targeted with an enforcement action for violating securities laws. The recent U.S. regulatory crackdown has also spooked many companies and investors, who are already looking to relocate to other jurisdictions.

However, when asked about how Canada‚Äôs PRU compared with the situation in the U.S., Nana Murugesan VP international and business development at Coinbase, said that he prefers Canada‚Äôs approach.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a couple of ways we see regulators acting: one is regulation by engagement; the other one is regulation by enforcement,‚Äù Murugesan said in an interview with CoinDesk. ‚ÄúThe latter part is tough, because you don‚Äôt know what the rules are.

42420391,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpfKP,1684501359,Bitcoin in Stasis Below $27K Ahead of Powell Speech,"The crypto market remained risk-averse early Friday, with the focus turning to an impending speech by Fed Chair Jerome Powell following Thursday's hawkish comments by other central bank officials.  Bitcoin (BTC) traded flat at just below $27,000, following Thursday's 2% decline. Other major coins except Ripple's XRP nursed moderate losses. In traditional markets, the dollar index pulled back to 102.30 from the two-month high of 103.62 and futures tied to Wall Street's tech-heavy Nasdaq index signaled a flat open.  Treasury yields rose alongside an increased probability of the Fed delivering another 25 basis point interest rate hike next month, helping keep investor risk appetite under check. The yield on the 10-year note rose to 3.67%, the highest since mid-March, and taking the weekly gain to 20 basis points. The two-year yield also clocked a two-month high of 4.08%. Recently, bitcoin has decoupled from Nasdaq and has moved in tandem with gold, which tends to move in the opposite direction of bond yields.  Earlier in May, markets were confident the Fed would pause its liquidity tightening cycle next month and pivot to rate cuts later this year. The confidence, however, was shattered on Thursday after St Louis Fed President James Bullard advocated higher interest rates and Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan said that data at this time does not support pausing the tightening cycle.  ""Hawkish comments from Fed officials and the first decline in continuing unemployment claims below 1.8 million in two months boosted US rates and the odds of a June rate hike rose to about 37%,"" said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, in a daily market update. ""This represents a near tripling of the probability in the past week,"" he added.  Optimism about a potential U.S. debt ceiling deal faded after a Reuters report said a group of Republican hardliners could block the deal if it doesn't contain robust spending cuts. The U.S. hit the debt ceiling of $31.4 trillion earlier this year, forcing the Treasury to implement extraordinary measures to keep the government functioning. Early this week, President Joe Biden expressed confidence the government will avoid an unprecedented and potentially catastrophic default.  At 15:00 GMT, Powell will speak at the ""Perspectives on Monetary Policy"" panel before the Thomas Laubach Research Conference hosted by the Federal Reserve.  Some observers expected a hawkish talk from Powell ‚Äì an outcome that will likely ensure the end-of-the-week flows in the market remain risk averse.  ""Seems like Powell needs to take the rate hike odds up again today in order to be prepared to go again in June if the debt ceiling debacle is tabled for a short term resolution,"" Craig Shapiro, macro advisor at LaDucTrading, tweeted. ""Data remains too good right now with the SEP likely to show a lower YE23 U rate and higher PCE, both of which suggest the dots for 24 are way too low.""

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  An onchain metric suggests that litecoin (LTC), the 12th largest cryptocurrency by market value, is trading at discounted prices. Litecoin's market value to realized value (MVRV) Z-score was negative at press time. A sub-zero score indicates the cryptocurrency is undervalued relative to its fair value, according to analytics firm Glassnode. The market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the total number of coins in circulation by the crypto‚Äôs price. The realized value is a variation of the market cap that adds the market value of coins when they last moved on the blockchain. It excludes all coins lost from circulation (more than 15%) and is said to reflect the real or fair value of the network.  The stablecoin universe continues to shrink and a sustained recovery in crypto prices is unlikely until this stops, JPMorgan said in a research report Thursday. A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that is pegged to another asset, such as the U.S. dollar. ‚ÄúHeadwinds from the U.S. regulatory crackdown on crypto, the unsettling of banking networks for the crypto ecosystem and the reverberations from last year‚Äôs FTX collapse are weighing on the stablecoin universe which continues to shrink,‚Äù analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.  Digital asset financial services firm HashKey Group is planning to raise funds at a $1 billion valuation, according to a Bloomberg report on Friday. The Asia-based HashKey is in preliminary talks to raise between $100 million to $200 million, according to the report, which cited people familiar with the matter. The firm is looking to capitalize on Hong Kong's re-emergence in recent months as a potential crypto hub as the city has looked to formulate a clear regulatory structure for digital assets. Hong Kong is looking to attract crypto firms to its shores as a means of generating greater investment and capital, following a few years of restrictions related to COVID taking their toll on the economy.  Chart of the Day  The chart by pseudonymous DeFi analyst Ignas shows that there currently are eight decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) with Treasury holdings less than the market capitalization of their respective tokens. (Treasury balances do include holdings of their own coins).  Per Ignas, these DAOs can be targeted by the so-called RFV raiders or supposed activist investors looking to take over the DAO to manipulate the price of tokens for financial gains.

Iris Energy has scaled to 5.5 EH/s and is guiding for 6.5 EH/s this year. The company has the cash needed for the ASICs. The company has market-leading mining efficiency numbers and no debt. In my previous Iris Energy ( IREN ) article for Seeking Alpha , I mentioned my belief that the company should consider flipping its treasury approach from a 100% production seller to some sort of hybrid model. This belief stems from the fact that Bitcoin supply emissions have been the largest driver of miner revenue by far. Thus, with a block reward halving happening overnight in a little under a year, all BTC miners theoretically benefit from holding BTC on the balance sheet to benefit from the theoretical increase in the coin's price. LookIntoBitcoin Bitcoin has a history of increasing in price following halving events. This is a somewhat critical part of the coin's construction because without higher coin prices, the miners who process transactions and secure the network see revenue decline in perpetuity if fresh supply at a constant USD-denomination is the only source of income. This is theoretically while input costs remain unchanged. It's not a great recipe for success long term but there is a recent catalyst that might minimize the impact from declining block reward emissions. Maybe HODLing Won't Be Necessary In a previous article covering Bitfarms ( BITF ), I explained some of the recent developments regarding the Ordinals NFT protocol and the impact that NFTs on the block space have had on Bitcoin transaction fees. I won't re-write that section again here but the main takeaway is that Ordinals lead to more transaction fees for miners and the inscriptions from that protocol have continued to make new highs in recent weeks: Ordinals Mints (Dune Analytics/dgtl_assets) I detailed why I felt Ordinals had the potential to lead to a fee war within the Bitcoin community back in early February, and that assessment is closer to coming to fruition. Regardless of whether everyone within the Bitcoin community likes Ordinals or not, the potential stickiness of transaction fees is a significant fundamental development for the miners. Despite short-lived spikes to fees over the years, the industry has been almost entirely reliant on fresh BTC supply emissions from the block reward. We can see the impact from the transaction fee increases in May in the chart below: IntoTheBlock Between January and April, the share of Bitcoin miner rewards coming from transaction fees averaged about 2.4%. Through the first half of May, that average has spiked to over 17%. While there are a couple clear outlier days on May 8th and May 9th that are helping to boost this surge in transaction fee share, even when we take those two days out of the average we still get a transaction fee share of total rewards of roughly 14% for the month of May. I have to be clear that I'm not saying that Ordinals or BRC-20 tokens will be what causes transaction fees to continue higher. But I will go as far as saying something likely needs to be adjusted to the model for miners to remain profitable long term. This is an idea that has been explored previously by analysts who are much smarter than me. In my personal view, the simplest approach might be the one that aligns with the free market mentality that I believe most bitcoiners possess; market participants simply have to start paying a more realistic fee for the service they're using. Surviving Crypto Winter Things looked pretty bad for the Bitcoin mining industry in Q4-22 and Iris Energy was no exception. After scaling from under 1 EH/s in March 2022 to nearly 4 EH/s by October, the crypto market moved against the sector and Iris had to forfeit machines held through special purposes vehicles. This led to a dramatic month over month fall in BTC production for Iris from October to November of last year: IREN vs BITF (Company Disclosures) While it was unfortunate the company missed out on 5 months of BTC mining revenue at a time when the coin was staging a recovery, Iris structured it's machine collateralization in a way that allowed the company to live another day and try again. At the end of April the company had 4.0 operating EH/s. As of May 10th , Iris has 5.5 EH/s. In my view, this scaling of capacity in such a short amount of time is impressive and encouraging. Iris Energy Iris is expecting to bring on another 1 EH/s of operating capacity, most of which is at the company's Childress site. Iris projects this will require an additional $35 million in capex to scale. On the last quarterly conference call CEO Daniel Roberts mentioned the machines required to bring on that additional EH/s have yet to be purchased and the company is being patient with those buys: In terms of anticipated CapEx, we haven't procured miners at this stage. We will look to do that. Over time, we don't see the urgency. We can give some guidance on what that might cost. There have been some recent market benchmarks that people can refer to. We're looking to procure the BITMAIN S-19 XP mines as a priority. Hashrateindex Fortunately, ASIC prices are still cheaper than at any point in the last year and Iris has the cash to pull off this additional EH/s scaling without taking on debt. Finally, the company has proven to be in a class of its own when it comes to maximizing efficiency: Miner YTD Metrics BTC Production Avg BTC per EH/s Iris Energy 820 94.3 CleanSpark ( CLSK ) 2,395 90.1 HIVE Blockchain ( HIVE ) 1,065 90.0 Bitfarms 1,676 87.5 Bit Digital ( BTBT ) 447 87.4 Sources: Company disclosures Year to date, Iris Energy has proven to be the most efficient miner in the space based on average BTC mined per EH/s. I expect that to continue given the company's intention to buy S19 XPs. Risks To date, Iris Energy has not been a profitable business. As currently constructed, the company is highly reliant on the price of Bitcoin and consumer demand for BTC. Bitcoin has had quite a bit thrown at it in the last 12 months and it seems clear that US-based regulators are in the ""fight them"" phase of the crypto story. This could theoretically diminish demand for BTC and that could negatively impact Iris Energy's stock. Investor Takeaways Crypto Winter has been devastating for many of the Bitcoin miners in the public equity markets. We've seen several examples of solvency issues, bankruptcies, and drastic reductions in production. Despite the hiccup in Q4, Iris Energy structured its obligations in an advantageous way and seems to have come out on the other side as one of the top companies in the industry again. For me the combination of exahash growth and mining efficiency make IREN a buy for Bitcoin miner stock holders. While I've previously been slightly skeptical of Iris Energy's BTC treasury management approach, if there is long term stickiness to BTC transaction fees, securing the network can theoretically be a profitable business even when the reward from fresh supply issuance is halved next year. I've again taken a small long and will look to add on any weakness in the near future.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4606012-iris-energy-transaction-fees-change-everything?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/12772518.jpeg

These developments have left many speculators wondering if this positive momentum will be sufficient to initiate a much-anticipated price rebound. With increased interest and activity surrounding Shiba Inu, all eyes are now focused on whether this surge in support will ultimately lead to a revitalization of the cryptocurrency‚Äôs fortunes. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Resurfaces After 2-Year Hiatus, Stakes $7.4 Million In ETH Shiba Inu Price Consolidation And Increased Capital Inflows Shiba Inu, over the past few days, has witnessed relatively low volatility on higher timeframe price charts. From May 8 onwards, its price has oscillated within a range of $0.00000832 and $0.00000914, indicating a period of consolidation. At the time of writing, CoinGecko reflects Shiba Inu‚Äôs price at a mere $0.00000871. In the past 24 hours, the cryptocurrency experienced a slight slump of 1.4%. The meme coin was up a very modest 0.3% over the course of the last seven days. Source: Coingecko Despite the recent price consolidation, the daily chart‚Äôs CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) and RSI (Relative Strength Index) have shown notable upward movements in the past few days. The CMF suggests increased capital inflows, while the RSI indicates rising buying pressure. SHIB Potential Rally Based On Fib Retracement, Market Conditions To analyze the potential price movement of Shiba Inu, traders have utilized the Fibonacci retracement tool by placing it between the swing high of the first quarter (Q1) and the lows observed in December. This tool helps identify crucial levels based on the Fibonacci sequence. If the current trend in SHIB continues and the overall macro environment conditions continue to improve, there is a possibility of a rally. This rally could lead SHIB to reach the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level, which stands at approximately $0.00000967. Fibonacci retracement levels are commonly used in technical analysis to identify potential support and resistance levels based on the historical price movement. The 23.6% level often represents an initial area of interest where a significant rebound or reversal could occur. SHIB market cap nearly unchanged at $5.22 billion.

A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that is pegged to another asset, such as the U.S. dollar.  ‚ÄúHeadwinds from the U.S. regulatory crackdown on crypto, the unsettling of banking networks for the crypto ecosystem and the reverberations from last year‚Äôs FTX collapse are weighing on the stablecoin universe which continues to shrink,‚Äù analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.  Despite a positive start to the year, cryptocurrency prices have slumped in the past month with the industry's overall market cap dropping from $1.26 trillion on April 13 to $1.089 trillion.  The U.S. regulatory clampdown continues to take its toll on USD Coin (USDC), which has experienced a loss of stablecoin market share at the expense of Tether (USDT), the report said.  Tether‚Äôs dominance has been further boosted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ban on rival stablecoin Binance USD (BUSD), the note said.  JPMorgan says the U.S. debt ceiling issue drew attention to the reserves of major stablecoins and their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities.  ‚ÄúThe share of U.S. Treasury securities in the reserves of major stablecoins has been increasing over time, implying a big challenge by stablecoins to maintain their pegs in an adverse scenario of a U.S. technical default,‚Äù the analysts wrote.  Any issues faced by stablecoins in such an adverse scenario would impact the whole crypto ecosystem given the role these cryptocurrencies play in providing access to trading and decentralized finance (DeFi), and as a source of collateral, the report added.  The bank notes that Tether has sought to diversify its stablecoin reserves to protect against the U.S. debt ceiling issue.

As the market witnessed a flurry of activity, an unexpected twist unfolded when an anonymous whale made a significant decision‚Äîto sell a portion of their coveted meme coins. In a move that raised eyebrows, one of these hefty Dogecoin holdings found its way to crypto exchange Binance, setting the stage for intrigue and speculation. This interesting development came at a time when Dogecoin was fiercely determined to regain its footing and recoup some of the losses it had endured in recent weeks. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Resurfaces After 2-Year Hiatus, Stakes $7.4 Million In ETH Dogecoin Whales Make Waves: Massive DOGE Transfers Raise Eyebrows In a series of transactions, the Dogecoin community has been abuzz with news of substantial transfers involving the popular meme-inspired cryptocurrency.

On the other end of the spectrum, the smallest transaction consisted of a still impressive 10,000,000 DOGE. Over a span of 24 hours, a total of five major transfers of the meme coin DOGE took place, as substantial chunks of cryptocurrency ranging from 10 million to 30 million DOGE were swiftly shifted between wallets. The flurry of activity has piqued the interest of the Dogecoin community and the wider crypto sphere, as they eagerly analyze the implications of these substantial movements. DOGE Whale Behavior Sends Ripples Through The Market: Impact On Price The recent surge of large-scale DOGE transfers by anonymous whales has not gone unnoticed, and their behavior has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency market. Unsurprisingly, the market has reacted to the recent whale transfers, resulting in notable price volatility for Dogecoin. The price of DOGE, as reported by CoinGecko, experienced a slight 0.7% slump in the past 24 hours. This downturn is likely attributed, at least in part, to the influx of substantial DOGE holdings hitting exchanges and potentially creating selling pressure. DOGE market cap currently at $10 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Related Reading: PEPE Outperforms Bitcoin In Social Media Buzz, Triggers Bullish Run For Frog Coin However, the broader trend for Dogecoin remains positive, with a 2.7% rally over the past seven days. This upward momentum, coupled with increased adoption and renewed interest in DOGE, may indicate that the impact of the whale transfers on the overall price has been mitigated by bullish market sentiment. Until then, observers will continue to dissect the actions of these anonymous whales, searching for insights and anticipating the next twist in the ever-evolving tale of Dogecoin. -Featured image from Cryptoglobe",NEUTRAL,DOGE,DOGE | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin-binance-receives-millions-of-doge/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

42420389,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpfIL,1684485331,XRP Bucks Bitcoin-Led Slide in Majors as SEC Case Tilts in Ripple‚Äôs Favor,"The XRP token rose as much as 5% in the past 24 hours after reports that the U.S. Securities and Exchange's (SEC) landmark case against Ripple was tilting in favor of the blockchain firm.  At the time of writing, XRP was trading over 2% higher at 46 cents posting gains for the second straight day. While, bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) fell 1%, leading a nominal slide in the broader crypto market.  The XRP token has added nearly 10% value in the past week, becoming the top gainer among major tokens.  In 2020,, the SEC sued Ripple on allegations that the firm sold unregistered securities. Ripple has historically maintained a distance from XRP, the token that powers some of its products and the XRP Ledger network. But any progress in the case clearly has an impact on XRP prices.  Earlier this week, a federal judge ruled that the SEC cannot seal documents tied to former official William Hinman's 2018 speech on crypto and securities to Ripple, stating that they were ‚Äúrelevant to the judicial process.‚Äù  District Judge Analisa Torres, of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, ruled that the documents tied to that speech, in which the former SEC Director of Corporation Finance stated that in his view, ether was not a security, cannot be sealed in a court order.  Access to these documents would mean Ripple lawyers can learn how Hinman came to that conclusion, which could impact XRP‚Äôs own classification as a security. This is considered bullish for XRP tokens by some traders as they price Ripple‚Äôs victory in the court case.

42420406,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpfav,1684485272,"Litecoin Is Undervalued, Onchain Indicator Suggests","An onchain metric suggests that litecoin (LTC), the 12th largest cryptocurrency by market value, is trading at discounted prices.  Litecoin's market value to realized value (MVRV) Z-score was negative at press time. A sub-zero score indicates the cryptocurrency is undervalued relative to its fair value, according to analytics firm Glassnode.  The market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the total number of coins in circulation by litecoin's going market rate. The realized value is a variation of the market cap that adds the market value of coins when they last moved on the blockchain.It excludes all coins lost from circulation (more than 15%) and is said to reflect the real or fair value of the network.  The Z-score shows by how many standard deviations the market value differs from the realized value.  Historically, Z-scores above eight have signified overvaluation and bull market tops, while negative values have indicated undervaluation and market bottoms.  The chart shows the Z-score has been consistently negative since July last year.  That's not new. The indicator has consolidated below zero several times in the past, eventually paving the way for meteoric bull runs.  If history is a guide, the path of least resistance appears to be on the higher side. That said, litecoin and the broader crypto market remain vulnerable to adverse macroeconomic developments like liquidity tightening and the state of the global economy.  At press time, LTC changed hands at $92, representing a nearly 31% gain for the year. Prices clocked a one-month high of $95 early this week, per CoinDesk data.

These smaller investors, often overlooked in favor of institutional giants, have recently reached a significant milestone, with the total supply of Bitcoin held by them surging to an all-time high of 1.31 million coins. This surge not only highlights the growing influence of retail investors in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies but also underscores their determination to ride the Bitcoin wave alongside their more affluent counterparts. Related Reading: Conflux Network Partners With China Telecom For Blockchain, SIM Project ‚Äì Details The Rise Of Bitcoin Shrimp Investors According to data analytics firm Glassnode, these shrimp investors have surged to an all-time high (ATH) of 1.31 million coins. The continuous rise in their holdings highlights their growing influence and raises intriguing questions about the evolving dynamics within the Bitcoin ecosystem. The #Bitcoin supply held by Shrimp Entities (<1 BTC) continues to relentlessly rise, expanding to an ATH of 1.31M coins. The cohort is currently experiencing a significant expansion of +26K coins per month, with only 202 (3.9%) trading days recording a larger monthly growth. pic.twitter.com/Fa2QCHxZPO ‚Äî glassnode (@glassnode) May 18, 2023 The data further reveals that shrimp investors are adding an average of approximately 26,000 Bitcoins to their cumulative holdings each month. This significant expansion is worth noting, considering that only 3.9% of trading days, equivalent to 202 days, have witnessed a larger monthly growth rate. These statistics underline the sustained interest in Bitcoin among retail investors, who remain undeterred by its well-known price volatility. The Shrimp Investor Effect On BTC Price Dynamics Bitcoin‚Äôs price, as reported by CoinGecko, currently stands at $26,914, reflecting a slight 1.1% decline over the past 24 hours, while the cryptocurrency was up 1.4% over the last seven days. Source: Coingecko The surge in shrimp investors, indicated by their increasing accumulation of Bitcoin, can have multiple impacts on the current price of BTC. The sustained interest and continuous buying pressure from shrimp investors can contribute to upward price momentum. As more retail investors enter the market and acquire Bitcoin, the increased demand can drive the price higher. This influx of buyers, particularly if they are accumulating the cryptocurrency at an unprecedented rate, as mentioned earlier, can create a bullish sentiment that attracts further investors and potentially leads to price appreciation. BTCUSD backpedals to the $26K level. Chart: TradingView.com Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Resurfaces After 2-Year Hiatus, Stakes $7.4 Million In ETH Conversely, the impact of shrimp investors on the price of BTC can be influenced by market dynamics and investor sentiment. While their accumulation may indicate growing interest, the overall sentiment in the market, including the actions of larger institutional investors or regulatory developments, can also influence the price. If negative news or a general bearish sentiment prevails, it can offset the impact of shrimp investors and result in a more stagnant or declining price. -Featured image from DELAYNA EARLEY / THE ISLAND PACKET VIA AP",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-shrimp-accumulation-surge/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/12768069.jpeg

However, the current market structure is bearish, supporting the bears in the short to medium term. Thus, MATIC bulls should defend $0.8339 as much as possible. With on and off-chain developments backing the token, MATIC might see a return to $1 in the coming days or weeks. Despite this, investors should be cautious in the short to medium term. Ethereum‚Äôs recent upward swing caused the altcoin market to follow as well. If these price swings continue to move upward, MATIC‚Äôs rise to $1 is secured.

Bitcoin is down 1.9% to $26,882, while ether is down 0.89% to $1,805.  A lot is weighing heavy on bitcoin, with macroeconomic uncertainty continuing to bother traders.  But Coinglass data shows that traders in Asia remain optimistic towards the asset class. Right now, traders are mostly in long positions, with 53.62% long and 46% holding shorts.  Liquidation data also favors the longs. Coinglass shows that $7.3 million in short positions were liquidated in the last four hours compared to $1.57 million in longs.  Traders seem to be even more bullish on ether, as 90% of liquidations were shorts, at $3.36 million, versus $361,000 in longs.  It could be because the regulatory situation in Asia is a bit more clear than in the U.S. Singapore has a framework for regulating crypto. Imperfect as it is, it exists. Hong Kong will have licensed crypto exchanges online by mid-year. Even Taiwan, known as a financial hub, will have a framework in place sometime in 2023.  Rulebooks, even if they aren‚Äôt perfect, create certainty. It‚Äôs much better for business than making things up ‚Äúon the fly.‚Äù  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector XRP XRP +3.5% Currency Stellar XLM +0.1% Smart Contract Platform  Insights  GrumpyCat and Pepe, two pump-and-dump meme coins, are at war. GrumpyCat‚Äôs feline army wants the frog on a platter.  GrumpyCat is based on the GrumpyCat meme of yesteryear, while Pepe is an image of a cartoon frog originally from a little-known cartoon called Boys Club but has since been re-appropriated by online groups. These are both recognizable brands made by someone else, and just like Charlie Brown or Homer Simpson, are the intellectual property of their respective authors.  The team behind GrumpyCat wants the world to know this is all a joke, and they aren‚Äôt in it for the money.  ‚ÄúGrumpyCat is not a revenue-generating project. In fact, it proudly embraces its status as a useless meme token,‚Äù the site reads. ‚ÄúGrumpyCat takes a cynical and skeptical approach to the world of crypto, providing a much-needed breath of fresh air for those tired of hype and unrealistic promises.‚Äù  But here‚Äôs the problem: they don‚Äôt have the rights to GrumpyCat. It‚Äôs not theirs to market. Even if they say it‚Äôs all in good fun and they aren‚Äôt doing it for the money, GrumpyCat, the IP, belongs to someone else. It‚Äôs the property of GrumpyCat LLC, and that company has specifically trademarked GrumpyCat in the context of crypto (as well as other merchandise), according to the U.S. Patent Office.  GrumpyCat LLC is making good on protecting its IP via a legal threat. Served on-chain, no less (which courts have given a green light to in New York and in the U.K). Pepe is also the property of someone that‚Äôs not the team behind the meme coin, and while they haven‚Äôt targeted the meme coin, they have aggressively gone after its unauthorized use.  Meme coins are fun, and they are driving nearly a billion dollars in trade on-chain, according to CoinGecko data. A debate about whether this is actual value is something for another time. The reality is that when projects get to have market caps in the size of Pepe ($673 million cap and $258 million in trading volume), trademarks and copyrights become real concerns.  It‚Äôs very likely that GrumpyCat‚Äôs team will just ignore the legal threat. But the law is catching up to crypto. We‚Äôre in an era now where there‚Äôs a legal precedent for the argument that DAOs and their founders have the same sort of liability as general partnerships and corporations.

42420397,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpfTh,1684460498,"NY Fed, Singapore Regulator Verify CBDC Interoperability, Payment Speeds in Latest Test","Central bank digital currency (CBDC) systems operating on different types of networks can be used for cross-border and cross-currency payments, a new report published by researchers with the New York Federal Reserve and Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said on Thursday.  The report, part of the NY Fed's New York Innovation Center and MAS's ongoing joint Project Cedar/Project Ubin research efforts, found that the respective teams were able to conduct cross-border transactions across different distributed ledger (DLT) and hashed timelock contract (HTLC) technology stacks, with near real-time settlement finality.  A note in the report specified the research focused on studying technical issues, and it ""does not reflect any decision to implement"" CBDCs or the underlying tech stacks anywhere in particular.  The researchers looked at questions of interoperability, atomic settlement whether transactions could settle near real-time, a press release said. The teams used simulated CBDCs and hypothetical payments.  ""Hashed timelock contracts, a form of smart contract, were used to successfully bridge ledgers with distinct underlying DLT systems and execute simulated cross-border, cross-currency payments,"" the report said. ""This demonstrated that interoperability could be established across ledgers with different technical designs.""  The researchers created eight different scenarios to test their interoperability hypotheses, the report said.  The atomic settlement tests found that all trades settled nearly 6.5 payments per second on average, with ""a peak of 47 payments per second.""  These payments were end-to-end, and the researchers were able to reach an average payment latency of less than 30 seconds, the report said.  In a statement, the Head of the New York Fed's Market Group, Michelle Neal, called cross-border payments ""a major railway"" for the global economy.  ‚ÄúOur research collaboration with the MAS reveals key opportunities for central bank innovation to play an important role in easing wholesale payment flows globally and improving settlement outcomes,"" Neal said.  Similarly, MAS Deputy Managing Director Leong Sing Chiong said ""the Cedar x Ubin+ experiment envisages a future digital currency landscape where central banks can enable interoperability of wholesale CBDCs to facilitate more efficient cross-border payment flows including for less liquid currencies, without requiring a common infrastructure"" in a statement.
