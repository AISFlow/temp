42376773,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eGRL,1387305041,Following the Money: Are Bitcoin Black Market Purchases Really Anonymous?,"This article is the second in a two-part interview with University of California-San Diego researcher Sarah Meiklejohn on her new research paper, ""A Fistful of Bitcoins: Characterizing Payments Among Men With No Names."" Part One provides an introduction to her paper and illustrates her findings on anonymity within the Bitcoin protocol.    Meiklejohn’s paper, “A Fistful of Bitcoins: Characterizing Payments Among Men With No Names,” provides a snapshot of the bitcoin economy as of April 2013.  The bitcoin economy of today looks a bit different than it did in April, back when notorious black marketplace Silk Road was still facilitating nearly $2m in monthly sales, and the price of 1 BTC was edging towards with the $100 mark.  However, many of the same concerns remain in the community today. Namely, with online black markets becoming the prime target of law enforcement, will those who participate in such actions face repercussions for their involvement?  University of California, San Diego researcher Sarah Meiklejohn recently completed a paper that traced the movements of bitcoin in April using heuristics, a specific problem-solving technique that allowed her to trace individual bitcoins from consumer-facing exchanges like Mt. Gox to marketplaces such as Silk Road.  Her comments to CoinDesk suggest that the answer is no, and furthermore, the US could take actions against past users. Meiklejohn said:  ""I would be surprised if some of the bigger drug dealers were not prosecuted, because it seems so easy at this point. The FBI now has all the data for Silk Road, they can see how much these guys earned, and they can see the addresses they used. So it really seems like they have a lot of what they need to be able to prosecute them. I would say small-time individual users, just buying a little bit of weed, are probably not going to be prosecuted.""  In an exclusive interview, Meiklejohn discusses how her research was able to prove to reporters that coins seized from the account of Ross Ulbricht, the accused Dread Pirate Roberts, had passed through Silk Road. Meiklejohn also discusses if it will be possible to prosecute bitcoin users in connection with the Silk Road case and whether it's possible to hide criminal transactions using the block chain today:  CoinDesk: If it's so hard to stay anonymous with a large amount of money, how are people getting away with large-scale theft?  Sarah Meiklejohn (SM): The point of the work was not to completely de-anonymize users. At best, what we can do is cluster these addresses together and say, 'These are all one user' but we still don't know who that user is.  The point was that this might erode your anonymity sufficiently to the point where an agency with subpoena powers would be able to step in.  For example, the thing we identified the most was transactions with services. Deposits into Mt. Gox, withdrawals from Mt. Gox, deposits into Silk Road, withdrawals from Silk Road.  Obviously, with all these transactions, we can say: 'look, there is an individual depositing bitcoins into Mt.Gox', but we certainly can't say which individual, unless that individual has identified their addresses publicly, in a forum or something.  In and of itself, we're not de-anonymizing the thief or the user, but the thing is – once you start transacting with services that know your real-world identity, you're making yourself vulnerable to these agencies that are going to that service or exchange and saying: 'I need to know who this is'.  We're not getting you all the way there but we're following these bitcoins to the doorstop of Mt. Gox. One of the most frustrating parts of bitcoin is that you can see this happening and there's nothing you can do about it.  I've had people email me and say, “I had these bitcoins stolen, can you help?” and I write back and say, “I can track them, but it's not clear what that's going to do for you.” If I say, “I saw your bitcoins go to Mt.Gox, it's not clear what that buys you.”  CoinDesk: Have you worked with law enforcement so far, and are they interested in this work?  SM: I've talked to a few different law enforcement agencies. Yep, there is definitely interest.  CoinDesk: Do you know of any bitcoin thieves who have been prosecuted successfully?  SM: No, but I have a favorite story about stolen bitcoins. In April, the mining pool Ozcoin had mined a block, and they wanted to pay their miners. Then someone hacked their script to steal the bitcoins.  Apparently the operator of this mining pool was a nice, respected guy in the bitcoin communtiy, and people really rallied around it – starting this witch hunt to follow the stolen bitcoins.  They didn't go very far. They went one hop, and then another hop to Strongcoin. Luckily Strongcoin is very identifiable, because all of their transactions go to this one strong address. The bitcoins then sat in Strongcoin, and the members of the bitcoin community really pressured the owners of the Strongcoin wallet service to turn the bitcoins in.  When the thief tried to spend the bitcoins, Strongcoin somehow hacked their own system so that the bitcoins went back to the owner, Ozcoin.  So this wasn't law enforcement, but this was kind of a sign that if you can track these flows of bitcoins and identify what they're doing, then you can implore that service to step in – and they did.  CoinDesk: I know you were not involved in the FBI's investigation of the Silk Road. But describe what you've observed with the Silk Road addresses since the case became public. Does that give you any insight into the FBI's work?  SM: I confirmed for some reporters that the funds flowing to the seized coins/FBI address were directly from the Silk Road, and that some of the coins flowing to Dread Pirate Roberts' seized coins were from Silk Road.  With these volumes of bitcoins flowing through the network, it's impossible to miss. 26,000 BTC flowing into an address within a few hours, that doesn't happen all the time.  CoinDesk: Has anything interesting happened with these addresses since then to make you wonder what the FBI is doing?  SM: The most interesting thing with those addresses will be in years when the case is over. For now, they have to keep those bitcoins in those addresses for evidence.  Once the trial is over, it sounds like what they're supposed to do is cash out, liquidate the assets. That's going to be interesting to see. Cashing out that volume of bitcoins now would take months, given the volume of trading. And who knows what bitcoin will look like in a year or two or whenever the trial is over. That will be something interesting.  In the meantime, the thing I find the weirdest about those addresses are these protest messages. I call it spam or graffiti. You ping the address with some tiny amount of bitcoins, and you attach a public note.  It ranges from advertisements for gambling sites to anti-government protest messages. It's kind of funny. The block chain is the global history of bitcoin, and that graffiti will be around forever.  CoinDesk: Do you expect a lot of individual Silk Road customers to be prosecuted?  SM: I would be surprised if some of the bigger drug dealers were not prosecuted, because it seems so easy at this point.  The FBI now has all the data for Silk Road, they can see how much these guys earned, and they can see the addresses they used. So it really seems like they have a lot of what they need to be able to prosecute them. I would say probably small-time individual users, just buying a little bit of weed, are probably not going to be prosecuted.  CoinDesk: What does the Silk Road case say about bitcoin crime? Do you feel like this case is showing people that the party's over? Or will the criminals just become more clever?  SM: If you know how bitcoin works and are very motivated to protect your anonymity, that is possible. The problem is there are more people who don't know.  We saw a lot of people buy their bitcoin from Mt. Gox or another exchange, then transfer the bitcoins that they just bought directly from their Mt. Gox address to the Silk Road account, and that's how they buy the drugs.  We saw a lot of that, and that's the biggest mistake – not understanding that hopping directly from an exchange that knows who you are to the site where you want to buy drugs is probably not a good idea.  CoinDesk: More sophisticated criminals would do what?  SM: Let's say you're a drug dealer. You've taken in a bunch of bitcoins, now you want to cash out. The first thing would be to withdraw to an address that you own that is outside of Silk Road and outside Mt. Gox. Then you would want to mix those bitcoins. Right now, this is somewhat tricky to do at scale.  Our experience with mix services was not great – one service stole our bitcoins and with the other one, they didn't come back very mixed. One of them was fine – but we only tried to mix 1 or 2 BTC. So who knows, once you scale.  Once you've mixed your bitcoins, you could drop them into an exchange and cash out.  That would be it. We wouldn't be able to track that. I don't know if I really want to be advertising that to future criminals, [laughs].  There's this tension between privacy and anonymity, and then usability. If you're not super into bitcoin, if you're just doing this as a way to make money, at some point, doing what I just described might be unattractive. That might be enough of a deterrent to not bother.  We've actually been looking into a form of ransomware recently. The idea is, someone holds something hostage and demands payment in bitcoins. I was trying to look for information about this, and I found a bunch of users online complaining about being held ransom – not that they were being held ransom, but that dealing with bitcoin was such a pain.  CoinDesk: What kind of things were they being threatened with if they didn't pay?  SM: This ransomware can come in a bunch of different forms. The most direct thing is, they just lock down your computer and say, 'Give us 2 BTC at this address and we'll unlock your computer'. It's a form of malware.  They've infected your computer, but rather than monetizing it using one of the ways that botnets typically do, they monetize very directly – by getting you to give them money in exchange for getting your computer back.  Our group just had a paper accepted [""Botcoin: Monetizing Stolen Cycles,"" lead author Danny Yuxing Huang, published 6th December] exploring bitcoin mining and the usage of botnets to mine bitcoins. The classic way that botnets make money is to send spam, do port scanning or steal credentials.  But it's this long-term process of monetization. And now there's ransomware – that's a more direct way. This other thing we've been seeing [over the past 18 months] is probably the most direct form you could imagine, which is just mining bitcoins.  So, I compromise your machine, and then I use your machine to mine bitcoins. I'm literally minting bitcoins with your infected machine.  We wanted to look and see how common that was, how much money these botmasters could make doing this, and get a sense of the landscape. It's definitely happening, and it definitely seems profitable.  Some of the pretty big botnets like ZeroAccess were doing this. [According to lead author Huang, hundreds of thousands of infected computers or more are mining bitcons, yielding hundreds of thousands of dollars in profit.]  This interview has been edited for clarity and length. Return to Part One of our interview with Meiklejohn here.

42376756,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eG8T,1387303237,Denmark's Authorities: Bitcoin is Not Regulated Here,"Denmark’s Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) today issued an official statement on the use of virtual currency in the country – and surprisingly, it’s not all bad news.  Although the FSA's statementhttp://www.finanstilsynet.dk/da/Nyhedscenter/Pressemeddelelser/2013/Advarsel-mod-virtuelle-valutaer-bitcom-mfl-2013.aspx echoed warnings issued by the European Banking Authority (EBA) and red flags from regulators worldwide, it emphasised that cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, will not be policed by Denmark’s financial regulators.  The statement highlights that virtual currency isn't covered by Denmark’s existing regulatory framework. Thus, cryptocurrencies cannot be subjected to the country's standard financial regulation.  According to the FSA, doing business with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies does not qualify as issuance of electronic money, currency exchanges, brokerages or deposit services. The regulator stated:  “Virtual currencies are a form of unregulated electronic money, as opposed to real money they are not issued or guaranteed by a central bank, which in some cases can be used to make payments.”  It added that: “Virtual currencies have emerged in many different forms, first in the context of online gaming and social networks. Later, virtual currencies evolved to be used as an alternative to real currency.”  As a result, bitcoin entrepreneurs who want to build businesses and establish exchanges in the country will not need government approval. A translation from the FSA’s website reads:  “Companies do not need permission to be able to establish their operation in Denmark if they want to run bitcoin exchanges that also include exchanging real money.”  Risky investments  However, like the EBA, the FSA pointed out that investors who choose to buy, trade and hold virtual currencies risk losing their investments, having their virtual currency stolen, or simply watching the value of their currency drop to zero.  The EBA has also warned that there is no assurance that virtual currencies can be exchanged for national currencies, adding that trading virtual currencies carries implications for both tax and crime.  Interestingly, the FSA is the first national regulator to implicitly name altcoins in its warning. The somewhat unflattering reference includes litecoin, zerocoin and linden dollars.  The FSA also added that bitcoin is accepted as payment by an increasing number of businesses both online and offline.  Denmark's 'hands-off' approach to bitcoin regulation is interesting, but will other nations follow?

Luckily a Russian bar franchise has started accepting bitcoins as a form of payment, so inebriated bar goers should have less explaining to do tomorrow.  Killfish bars allows users to create their own wallets using credit cards and multiple mobile payment services, as well as bitcoin. Russian tech magazine Tjournal gave it a try and it worked.  One bitcoin would add $706.16 (at the time of writing) to the wallet and there is just a small fee to pay, roughly 0.0001BTC. However, the process wasn’t very smooth or fast, as it took more than half an hour and multiple confirmations.  Killfish bars can be found in 25 Russian cities, including Moscow, St. Petersburg, Kazan and Chelyabinsk. The bars are renowned for cheap food and booze, as well as aggressive marketing, including referral schemes.  The company says it plans to comply with local laws, but cryptocurrencies are not exactly regulated in Russia, or other parts of the world for that matter.  Killfish is not the first bar to embrace bitcoin. The Pembury Tavern in Hackney, east London, started accepting bitcoin earlier this year. The tavern employed a straightforward QR code based payment system that requires customers to simply open their bitcoin wallet and snap the QR code.  Sydney’s Old Fitzroy became the country’s first bar to accept bitcoin back in September, dubbing the programme ‘Beer for Bitcoins’. It also uses a QR code system.  If you every find yourself short on renminbi while touring the Glorious People’s Republic of China, you can buy a bitcoin pint at the 2nd Place Cafe Bar in Beijing’s Wudaokou suburb. It is the first such establishment in the country to accept bitcoin.  CoinDesk would like to remind you to drink responsibly during this festive period!

42376771,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eGQ5,1387298423,Bitcoin Ideology and the Tale of Casascius Coins,"A weekend article in The New York Times examined the ideological underpinnings of the bitcoin cryptocurrency. While the article got most of it correct, it missed some additional principles that are core to the adopters of bitcoin.  First of all, a vote for bitcoin is essentially a vote against the established monetary order with its centralized authority, legacy infrastructure, and diminishing financial privacy. Moreover, it is also a vote for an individual's choice in currency and freedom of transaction without payment blockades and surveillance. To both the technical and non-technical, bitcoin represents fungibility, irreversibility, and user-defined privacy.  As The New York Times pointed out, additional facets that bitcoin adopters find attractive include how bitcoin demonstrates the absurdity of a central bank's unlimited issuance model and the irrelevancy of self-serving capital controls.  A decentralized cryptocurrency separates a functioning medium of exchange from state control.  Nothing illustrates this more starkly than a physical bitcoin on a coin-shaped metal disc, which could be considered a negotiable monetary instrument in some jurisdictions. Lately, bitcoin has appreciated so much that the older 10 BTC and 25 BTC Casascius coins must now be declared to US Customs when entering or exiting the US.  FinCEN's involvement  On November 27th, Casascius founder Mike Caldwell received a letter from FinCEN, the US Treasury bureau responsible for safeguarding the financial system from illicit use and combating money laundering. The letter implied that his three-year-old business of selling coin-shaped pieces of metal could be defined as a money services business requiring registration with FinCEN and possibly registration with the money transmitter regulators in each individual state.  The FinCEN claim rested largely on the premise that Caldwell had no way of verifying that the coins were being shipped to the same person, or persons, that purchased the items with bitcoin. Caldwell believes that the coins should be viewed as collectibles.  Subsequently, Caldwell suspended operations of his coin-shaped metal business and ceased taking orders for purchases of new product. He also engaged legal counsel to ascertain if his business was indeed acting as a money transmitter under the law.  In telephone conversations with Caldwell, he reiterated to me that the ongoing operation of his business was secondary to establishing the important freedom-to-contract principles and choice in currency principles. According to Caldwell, he took the drastic step to suspend as a precaution, however he does not believe that he is in violation of any existing laws as he is only sending empty private keys in the mail.  Business model  Under the current business model, Casascius receives an order and the payment received does not involve any US currency or any other countries' currency. He accepts bitcoin for the sale of a round metal disc with a private key attached under a hologram. The strong reputation of Casascius and its process is paramount to the success of a physical bitcoin, because it involves trusting the integrity of a third party.  During shipment, the coin-shaped piece of metal is valueless and corresponds to a bitcoin address containing zero bitcoin. When the recipient receives the coin-shaped piece of metal, an appropriate amount of bitcoin is transferred to the corresponding public key, or bitcoin address.  In an alternate approach, Casascius could send the coin-shaped metal and allow the recipient to initiate the transfer of bitcoin to the corresponding bitcoin address, thereby removing Caldwell from handling the bitcoins at all. In that scenario, Caldwell would not be handling US dollars or bitcoin so it would be difficult to see how any possible money transmission was occurring.  Recalescence Coins, LLC  in Port Orchard, WA has already moved to the model of selling blank coins as a result of the FinCEN letter received by Casascius.  Caldwell and his attorney plan on responding to the FinCEN letter, describing their process and outlining a satisfactory business model.  Casascius uses brass tokens in the shape of a coin. Another business based in the UK sells similar coins. Other companies could just as easily use rectangular plastic or special paper to store a hidden private key. They could even be divided, sent separately, and re-joined later to form a complete private key. However, the requirement to separate a private key would mean sending empty private keys in the mail somehow represents a form of money transmission which it does not.  Form factors  Also, form factors matter legally, or they should. Phil Zimmermann faced a somewhat similar situation when he could not export his email encryption program, Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), due to US restrictions on the exporting of encryption with ""munitions-level"" strength. A group of volunteers then transcribed the computer code line-by-line into a book format to export PGP as a book to be re-transcribed and compiled on the other side.  Money is the speech of commerce and ""we need freedom of speech in our financial commerce,"" says Mike Gogulski, a stateless ex-American living in Bratislava, Slovakia.  The Liberty Dollar case exemplified how far a government will go when alternatives to the compulsory unit of account begin to emerge. The Liberty silver coins containing real silver were embarrassing to the government that was issuing the fake silver coins, so the public had to be protected from thinking that the real silver coins were actually money. Huh? Government prosecutors in the case laughingly described Bernard von NotHaus as representing a ""unique form of domestic terrorism"".  [post-quote]  All money is an illusion at some level, because like language and religion, its proliferation and success depends on growing adoption from an increasingly larger pool of adherents.  The creator of the Bitcoin protocol gave the world a method to conjure up its own monetary illusion. The reason this is a gift is because, prior to bitcoin, other monetary illusions depended either on legal tender laws for their illusory value or physical objects like gold and diamonds which are easily confiscated.  Bitcoin put the power of ""survivable"" money directly in the hands of the masses. It is a testament to bitcoin's survivability that it still exists today.  Bitcoin is not permitted to exist because various governments are bitcoin-friendly or pledge to support innovation. Bitcoin exists today precisely because it is distributed and decentralized, designed to outlast political institutions. And, it is beyond confiscation because it is digital. If it could be eradicated, it would have been eradicated as soon as it broke out of its niche market with a few pizza deals back in early 2010.  I understand from sources that approximately twelve such letters were issued by FinCEN in the last 30 days. If so, the purpose hopefully is to better understand these bitcoin business models and not just to use impressive letterhead in persuading voluntary business suspensions. In the case of Casascius, I fear the latter.

42376759,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eGAz,1387289427,Barclays Bank Blocks Customer's Account Following Bitcoin Transaction,"A Barclays customer in Scotland has claimed the bank blocked access to his account after he made two transactions to buy bitcoin.  The customer, who wanted to remain anonymous, wrote about his experience under the username Apollo Moonwalker on reddit.  He has since revealed to CoinDesk that he bought bitcoin through Bitstamp and Localbitcoins in the first week of December. He claimed he sent about £100 each time, first through a SEPA payment to BitStamp and then a bank transfer to a seller on Local Bitcoins a week later.  After making the second transaction through Local Bitcoins, he said he could no longer access his account through internet banking, adding:  ""My internet banking was immediately shut off as soon as I tried to make this particular payment and I couldn't log on, but when I phoned [Barclays] they had me confirm both transfers.""  The customer said he was automatically logged out of Barclays' internet banking platform and received an error notice saying: ""Error RP309 you have been blocked from Barclays Online Banking.""  He claimed that he tried to login again through his phone, but was unable gain access.  The customer's internet banking remained blocked for three days, from 6th to 9th December, he said. He claimed that he had to place two half-hour phone calls and a visit to a Barclays branch to get the matter resolved, adding:  ""It was not a simple matter to get fixed. I have no idea what I would have done if this happened when I was out of the country three weeks ago.""  The customer, who works in the oil and gas industry, added that he had experienced similar restrictions to his internet banking when he had previously performed transactions abroad.  However, he noted that it had been easier to regain access to his account's internet banking in those instances, usually requiring a one 30-minute phone call to the bank.  When CoinDesk contacted Barclays for clarification, a press officer said the matter would be looked into, but declined to comment on-record.  A search on Barclays' online banking help pages revealed no results for the error code, nor reasons why the customer was automatically logged out of the platform.  The Barclays customer added that he had completed many purchases through Bittylicious and Local Bitcoins in the past without any restrictions.  Bitcoin in the UK  Bittylicious  is a UK marketplace that allows individuals to sell bitcoin and feathercoin to buyers via bank transfer. Bittylicious users can buy cryptocurrencies using Barclays' Pingit mobile payment app. The app, which lets customers send and receive money from individuals and businesses, is available to the public and is not restricted to Barclays account holders.  The Barclays customer's post about his experience on reddit has attracted 151 comments to date. The top comment read:  ""Banks are scared and already making the same mistakes that the music industry made 15 years ago.""  UK Banks have been cautious about dealing in bitcoin, as the cryptocurrency remains unregulated here. Additionally, bitcoin exchanges in the UK have faced difficulty finding banks willing to do business with them.  Tom Robinson, the founder of bitcoin exchange BitPrice, has said that finding a bank to work with is one of the main reasons he hasn't launched his service yet.  Another high-profile exchange, Coinfloor, recently had to delay a much-hyped launch date.  One reason UK banks have treated bitcoin with caution is due to the digital currency's uncertain status here. Regulators have struggled to understand the cryptocurrency.  For example, the tax authority recently met UK bitcoin lobbyers to gather information so that it could rethink its earlier decision to classify the cryptocurrency as a payment voucher, which would attract a 20% value-added tax to every transaction.

The investment firm claims to be the first public company with a presence in bitcoin, thanks to its new subsidiaries: Bitcoin Canada Investments Inc and Bitcoin Angel Capital.  Bitcoin Canada will invest exclusively in bitcoin, while Bitcoin Angel will invest in early-stage projects in bitcoin as well as other cryptocurrencies. GreenBank plans to spin-off both companies at a later date, listing their shares publicly on the Canadian Stock Exchange.  GreenBank will maintain a hands-on approach, managing the bitcoin investment portfolio in both subsidiaries for a 10% fee of portfolio appreciation. The company said in a statement:  “GreenBank intends to make a private placement to accredited investors of up to $5,000,000 Debentures with conversion rights into 90% of the common shares of Bitcoin Canada and Bitcoin Angel.”  GreenBank hopes the move will allow investors to gain more exposure to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Danny Wettreich, CEO of GreenBank, Bitcoin Canada and Bitcoin Angel, said:  ""Bitcoin is a digital cryptocurrency that is not issued by any government, bank or central organization. During 2013, the market price of bitcoin has increased dramatically, and increasing acceptance and popularity will make it a viable alternative to fiat currencies."" He added:  ""I believe that Bitcoin is in the early stages of becoming a revolutionary payment medium, and GreenBank intends to be actively involved as a bitcoin incubator and investor.""  GreenBank has a long tradition of focusing on investments in Canadian small cap companies. It also facilitates the listing of private companies on the Canadian Stock Exchange, arranges acquisitions and mergers, and invests in equity.

His Las Vegas mansion, a luxurious 25,000 square-foot home which features a Jacuzzi in its staff quarters, yes – staff quarters, is adorned with metamorphic rock sourced from China, Iceland and Brazil.  The house also contains a “secret” garden and the books in its library rest upon American cherry wood shelves.  Now the mansion up for grabs, and you can pay with bitcoin – well, if you happen to have $7.85m worth of the currency, that is.  Sommer, who previously owned The Aladdin casino resort in Las Vegas (now the Planet Hollywood casino resort), decided to offer the property to bitcoin buyers as a means of attracting publicity after a suggestion from his sons, who are both keen bitcoiners.  The entrepreneur told the Las Vega Review-Journal:  “The advantage is that we’re expanding our market and adding some notoriety.”  The property, which is situated within a gated community on a golf course, has been on the market since the beginning of October, according to the property listing.  His sons have mined, stockpiled and traded bitcoin, using the currency to “buy computers, software and other equipment,” the Las Vegas Review-Journal added.  Alberta property  Earlier this year, Canadian Taylor More tried to sell his home in Alberta for bitcoin.  His 2.9-acre property was listed at CA$405,000 (US$382,616), with a discount for those paying with bitcoin. CNET Australia said the property looked like “a great opportunity for someone who's looking for a fixer-upper”.  Just this month, another property in Alberta was listed with bitcoin as a payment option. According to the National Post, the CA$1m (US$944,733) property in Red Deer includes:  “A four-bedroom, two-bathroom home complete with greenhouse, a secret room accessible via a walk-through closet and a private forest.”  Yes, you can now buy your own private forest with bitcoin. According to the property listing, the master bedroom has room for “two king sized beds, a sitting area and office space”, which means that it’s probably bigger than most London flats.  Attention to detail  But although Sommer’s Las Vegas mansion isn’t the first property to list bitcoin as a payment option, it is certainly the most lavish. Sommer told the Las Vegas Review-Journal: “This house was an exercise in how many cool details we could put in.”  Although it doesn’t have a private forest, its does have a 120-ton cooling tower that supplies air conditioning to the property, as well as a 2,000 square-foot guest house where Anna Nicole Smith once shot a film.  Sommer and his wife, Laura, are downsizing now their seven children have flown the coop, according to AP.  In practice, using bitcoin to buy the property could prove tricky – due to the continued volatility in its price. Julian Tosh, owner of bitcoinsinvegas.com, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal:  “If the value is changing 30% a day, how do you quantify that in a contract and expect each side to hold on for 30 to 90 days while escrow clears.”  But with the asking price at almost $8m, very few bitcoin fans will be able to afford it. And hey, who would actually want to buy it? It doesn’t even have a private forest …  Las Vegas image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Kadhim Shubber,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/17/bitcoin-bidders-welcome-for-luxurious-785-million-vegas-mansion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/878053eca849e97244624cf51017aed09e0efe58-1000x665.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42422954,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1yuxh,1387276223,"Additional Sources Confirm China's Payment Processor Ban, Bitcoin Price Falls $200","UPDATE: CoinDesk can confirm that the source for our original piece on the PBOC ban was Bobby Lee, CEO of bitcoin exchange BTC China. Lee said he is now happy to go on the record.  -------------------------------------  Bitcoin dipped to its lowest price in a week, following yesterday’s reports that the People’s Bank of China had banned third-party payment firms from dealing with bitcoin exchanges.  Prices took a dive throughout the day, starting at around $876 on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index in the early hours (GMT), and falling to as low as $645 later in the day. Prices briefly rallied up to $771 on the BPI, only to dip once again.  At its lowest point over the 24 hours, the virtual currency took a 22% loss.  Original reports of the ban came from a trusted source within China’s bitcoin community, who had spoken to a participant present at the meeting between third-party payment companies and the Bank itself.  Over the course of the day, Chinese news sites reportedly confirmed the claims with PayPal and Alipay (a subsidiary of the international trading company Alibaba). Alipay is said to deal with 65 financial institutions and have at least 700 million registered accounts.  TenPay, another third-party payment company, also reportedly confirmed the news to journalists. In China, third-party payment companies are licensed by the government-operated PBOC. TenPay received its licence back in May 2011.  December's fluctuation  At the time of writing, the price fluctuation in bitcoin hasn't yet matched that of 5th December, when the PBOC issued a statement warning financial institutions to steer clear of the currency.  Following that announcement, the currency lost $300 in a single morning on Mt. Gox. In turn, the Coindesk Price Index fell from $1,139 to $584 by that weekend.  History tells us that China's role in bitcoin is large enough to spook investors into selling. The Chinese Yuan has outpaced the USD volume-wise as a fiat pair with bitcoin. 46% of bitcoin-fiat trades are conducted in the Chinese Yuan, while 44% are conducted in US dollars.  Nevertheless, market watchers urged the market to stay calm. Jaron Lukasiewicz, CEO of New York-based bitcoin exchange Coinsetter said:  “This development will have a negative influence on bitcoin’s near-term price potential, but I would encourage investors to remember that speculation doesn’t drive reliable value in general.""  ""Bitcoin’s long term value will ultimately be derived through global usage as a payment network in less restrictive countries,” he added.  Funding and withdrawal options  Exchange users in China have reported a decrease in the number of funding and withdrawal options for BTC China.  The image below shows funding options, which still include banks but have been reduced to only one third-party provider, Yeepay:  The second image shows the withdrawing options available. There are only five remaining, and Yeepay is not included on the list:  Zennon Kapron, a financial technology analyst and consultant whose company Kapronasia operates out of Shanghai, said as recently as three days ago one that of his friends had been able to fund a BTC China account through China Merchants Bank. The money arrived within a few hours.  Today, however, transactions resulted in errors and could not be completed.  Third-party companies  It seems that some existing relationships are continuing, said Kapron, but no new ones are allowed and third-party transfer options must close by the Chinese New Year (around the end of January on the Western calendar).  Kapron claimed third-party companies were likely the first warned by the authorities and that's why they were the first to exit the scene. Banks could possibly come next.  However, Kapron also noted that these new revelations have come from meetings with business operators, and an official statement has yet to be published on the People's Bank of China website.  Another source, who operates a bitcoin-related business in China, confirmed the funding and withdrawal options had been curtailed since the People's Bank meeting, and likened the situation to poker-playing websites in the US.  The source explained that users are free to access the sites and play as much 'poker' as they like, but US financial institutions have been barred from transferring funds to them, effectively banning Americans from playing poker online.  At its peak in early December 2013, BTC China listed bitcoin prices topping $1,250. The exchange traded 109,841 bitcoins in the week preceding 4th November, compared with Bitstamp’s 93,372 and Mt. Gox’s 76,673.  Given the nature of business and government in China, and particularly the current climate regarding digital currencies, several of CoinDesk's sources requested not to be identified by name.
