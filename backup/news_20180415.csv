42380583,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gSU9,1523791806,A Hobbyist Crypto Trader's Life in Tax Hell,"Chandan Lodha is co-founder at CoinTracker, a portfolio and tax manager for cryptocurrency. He can be reached on Twitter here.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's Crypto and Taxes 2018 series.      As a hobbyist investor, my first foray into cryptocurrency was with Coinbase.  I was buying a few coins here and there, and everything was simple enough to manage in a spreadsheet. I would record the date, time and amount bought and sold for every transaction. This worked well enough for the first 10 transactions.  Soon, however, like many others in the space, I found myself deep down the cryptocurrency rabbit hole.  I had exchange accounts on GDAX, Poloniex, Binance and a bunch of others. I was buying privacy coins on decentralized exchanges. I had read about the large-scale exchange hacks which burned many folks in the past, so I set up cold storage hardware wallets and ended up with over 15 different wallets for different types of altcoins.  Still, I was a hobbyist; I was new to the space and just tinkering with small amounts of these coins, learning, curious to see how this digital, decentralized economy operated and how the underlying technologies all worked.  It was fascinating, but also confusing as hell.  The moment I moved a single coin out of Coinbase, the exchange no longer had an accurate reporting of my holdings and transactions so its tax report was incorrect.  My own spreadsheet was getting unwieldy, as I started to integrate Google Apps scripts to look up exchange prices from the different exchange accounts I had, plus match-up cost bases for wallet-to-wallet transfers.  The spreadsheet got more and more complicated, until one day it took two minutes to load.  Money on the line  That was the breaking point – there had to be a better way than running this hacky spreadsheet.  Normally, for a side project I wouldn’t have cared, but this was actual money on the line and I didn’t have a clue how much fiat money (U.S. dollars) I had invested. How was I going to calculate my capital gains taxes on crypto if I didn’t even know how much money I have invested in the first place? It was becoming financially irresponsible for me to not have a better grasp of this.  I turned to my friend sitting next to me and asked him how he was solving the same problem for himself. He turned his laptop to me: a nearly identical complicated spreadsheet (in fairness, his was better than mine).  There was no way that mainstream users were jumping through these hoops. We immediately started researching what other crypto-enthusiasts were using to solve the tracking problem.  To our disappointment, there were no good tools. The most popular tool was a mobile app that operated like a stock ticker app: it would show you the prices of coins daily and, if you wanted, allowed you to manually add these coins into a portfolio, one at a time.  This was even worse than the spreadsheet we already had and wasn’t at all personalized to our particular portfolios, let alone calculating our cost basis, capital gains, or providing any useful information for taxes.  Then and there, my friend and I decided to stop doing what we were doing and productionize our spreadsheets (OK, his spreadsheet) into a simple website. It was the first incarnation of what has now become CoinTracker.  Takeaways  The moral of the story: make sure you keep good records of your transactions, or use exchanges which provide these records for you.  If you are using multiple exchanges and wallets, trading multiple coins, or using secure cold or local storage for your coins (which everyone should do) then there are several tools out there which can help you track your whole portfolio, your return on investment, the amount of fiat invested, and perhaps most importantly your cost basis and capital gains.  In the future, ideally the IRS will help clarify the tax rules which apply to cryptocurrency, especially around grey-area issues such as like-kind exchange (retroactively), which accounting methods are acceptable for capital gains (e.g. FIFO, HIFO, etc.), and airdropped coins.  Until then I hope to see exchanges and brokers making easy reporting a priority so that their users are not left scrambling to figure out their tax situation.  Meantime, I recommend educating yourself about how to secure your coins, and learning about how cryptocurrencies are regulated in your jurisdiction. If you haven’t already nailed down your 2017 cryptocurrency taxes, file a free tax extension (but make sure to pay your estimated taxes due to avoid late fees).  Even though cryptocurrency is still a nascent space with lots of uncertainty and some headaches – like the ones I’ve described above – I’m very hopeful about the future of the industry. Rarely does such a revolutionary tech come along and there are lots of great materials out there to learn more.

42380572,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gSIp,1523786455,Why Leading Crypto Devs Don't Work In Silicon Valley,"""If you or your engineer friend is bored at BigTechCo, get in touch.""  The tweet, sent out by Coinbase vice president and general manager Dan Romero, represented a rare request from the San Francisco-based exchange. Despite building on various cryptocurrency protocols for years, it was perhaps the first time the company had signaled it would offer financial support to someone working directly on open-source code.  As such, the tweet drew its fair share of confusion among bitcoin and ethereum's largely volunteer developers.  That's not to say that they aren't interested in taking sponsorships from companies in an effort to make money from their passions – they are. But the trouble is many developers see larger industry startups like Coinbase, which made more than $1 billion in revenue last year, as a prime example of the ""big tech companies"" that Romero positioned as antagonists.  In fact, some would go so far as to say there’s a quiet struggle being waged in the blockchain industry between the coders who develop these open-source protocols and those who mainly sell related products or services for commercial interest from their corner offices in Silicon Valley.  This was on full display when Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr tweeted a disgruntled reply to Romero after private conversations clarified that the role wouldn't focus exclusively bitcoin or ethereum, nor would it give developers autonomy to focus on projects they see as beneficial.  Instead, Coinbase executives would be directing the work, potentially requiring the developers work on cryptocurrencies that might run afoul of their own personal tastes. (As an example, in the case of Dashjr, the long-time bitcoin coder, was loathe to devote time to rival bitcoin cash).  Coinbase acknowledges a kind of disconnect, yet thinks the lines between industry and open-source will continue to blur.  ""At a high level, we want to invest in supporting open-source communities, because we believe that the future of this industry will be defined more by open source than by enterprises,"" Jori Lallo, a software engineer at Coinbase told CoinDesk. ""That said, as a fast-growing company we've had a lot of things to split our time between, and admittedly we didn't spend a lot of time on supporting open source in the early days.""  That initial neglect left a lasting impression that has been hard for Coinbase to shrug off.  According to Jeremy Rubin, a Bitcoin Core contributor, Silicon Valley’s culture in general remains at odds with open-source philosophy, in that the former doesn’t give enough credit and support to the broader ecosystem.  Rubin told CoinDesk:  “You see this at a couple different companies but I think they [Coinbase] are one of the most egregious. They’re trying to do better, but they got a ways to go.”  Not enough?  Still, Lallo detailed some of the exchange's work in reaching out to the open-source developer community that has attempted to shift that perception.  For instance, in mid-March, Coinbase introduced the Coinbase Protocol Team, whose mission it is to contribute to community-led projects, naming payment channels, proof-of-stake blockchains and light clients as some areas of interest, and widely respected bitcoin programmer Jim Posen is a part of the team.  Around the same time, Coinbase announced its Open Source Fund, which donates roughly $25,000 a month to public blockchain projects.  Even Dashjr recognizes that Coinbase's efforts aren't ""bad"" and could even bring to the table some insights that open-source developers may miss, since they don't interface with the business community quite as much. ""It just isn't the norm or ideal,"" Dashjr said.  Others argue, though, that such programs, after years of inaction, aren't enough, though Rubin said he sees the problem as bigger than any one company.  In Rubin's view, lucrative blockchain companies could easily donate a few million dollars each in grants and sponsorships for open-source developers. It's the same argument open-source developers have made regarding a whole slew of integral internet protocols that have allowed companies like Google, Facebook and Uber to grow into multi-billion-dollar companies.  “Not only do they not do that [provide generous patronage], but they don’t support a lot of conferences that are really critical to the space. They didn’t support the MIT Bitcoin Expo this year, even though they sent a bunch of recruiters,"" Rubin said, adding:  “I don’t think Coinbase really gets open source.""  In addressing the criticisms, Lallo said, ""As we grow, expect to see more investments – both in terms of time and money.”  Coinbase also announced in a blog post on Thursday that a new venture capital arm of the company will provide ""financing to promising early-stage companies"" that ""move the space forward in a positive, meaningful way.""  Rethinking the culture  But it might take more than time and money.  According to Christopher Allen, the former principal architect at Blockstream, it's more about adapting to the culture of open source.  For instance, Blockstream, which funds the work of several developers who solely work on the bitcoin protocol, goes a step further by offering employees individual patent rights for technologies they contribute to, in addition to roughly 20 percent paid leave to work on side projects.  “These types of very progressive attitudes towards open source were a large part of my consideration [in joining Blockstream] because I’ve been working on my own projects for a number of years,"" Allen said. ""I wanted to be able to continue to work on them without being constrained.”  Joe Lubin  , founder of ethereum startup incubator ConsenSys, echoed the importance of this cultural shift toward independence. As such, ConsenSys strives to retain top talent by letting employees choose their own projects and work whenever and from wherever they want.  Tough to retain  Still, many leading blockchain companies struggle to retain talent.  For example, bitcoin security startup BitGo lost Alex Bosworth, a renowned developer who now works on lightning network implementations, in December.  According to Bosworth, the missions of large tech companies, and now large crypto companies, run counter to the ideals of the developers who started developing the protocols to begin with.  “The tech companies are building empires based on locking users into walled gardens and generally not thinking about what is best to progress the needs of the user,"" he said. ""That's something that open source software addresses which is pretty inspiring and fulfilling to work on.”  As such, the community has rallied around several initiatives that fund developer work without strings attached.  For instance, several developers CoinDesk spoke to mentioned Chain Code Labs, which sponsors a handful of Bitcoin Core developers at a financial loss through the money the founders, Alex Morcos and Suhas Daftuar made from a previous Wall Street venture. And Allen recently launched the GitHub Blockchain Guild, which aims to create new opportunities to fund contributions to various blockchain projects.  The collaborative, autonomous nature of these initiatives is what makes open-source cryptocurrency developers so drawn to them.  Speaking to the need for the industry to adapt to the open-source culture, Lubin said:  “Nobody works on projects that they don't care deeply about. An entrepreneur's freedom to develop their own projects and operational style doesn't need to change.”  Golden Gate Bridge image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/04/15/why-leading-crypto-devs-dont-work-in-silicon-valley,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/692d764452146209a6a282e6bed858ef1c4ee0f9-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
