42378127,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MD6T,1428000015,"$1 Million Legal Fight Ensnares Ripple, Bitstamp and Jed McCaleb","Bitstamp has initiated legal action over more than $1m in disputed funds related to the sale of nearly 100m XRP last month.  Bitstamp  , which operates a Ripple gateway and bitcoin exchange, filed a complaint for interpleader on 1st April in the US District Court in the Northern District of California. Jed McCaleb, the founder of both Ripple Labs and Stellar, and two of McCaleb’s family members were named in the complaint.  The $1,038,172 in disputed funds were used by Ripple Labs to purchase 96,342,361.6 XRP put up for sale through an account allegedly controlled by McCaleb, according to the complaint.  The dispute represents the latest battle between Ripple Labs and McCaleb, who co-founded the company only to later depart and establish Stellar, a fork of the Ripple network. Since then, the two sides have fought over network issues and were later the subject of an in-depth report by the New York Observer.  Origin of dispute  The filing goes on to state that Ripple Labs told Bitstamp that the sale was in violation of an contract agreed upon between the company and McCaleb. That agreement, struck in August 2014, established that McCaleb was entitled to sell only $10,000 in XRP per week during the first year, an amount that will become gradually greater over a seven-year schedule.  Ripple Labs and Jacob Stephenson, McCaleb's cousin, have since laid claim to the money, with Ripple Labs allegedly sending two letters to Bitstamp between 26th and 30th March demanding release of the funds.  Bitstamp has asked the court to settle the claims dispute, according to court documents obtained by CoinDesk. Bitstamp’s legal team wrote in the filing that “with respect to the disputed funds, Bitstamp is a disinterested stakeholder.”  Bitstamp counsel George Frost, who represented Ripple Labs in a dispute following the resignation of former board member Jesse Powell, said in a statement:  ""Bitstamp was unable to resolve this demand with Ripple Labs. Given our inability to ourselves determine the facts underlying the ownership dispute, we decided that an Interpleader filing was the proper approach. Indeed, it is only method to resolve disputes in these difficult circumstances.""  When reached for comment, Ripple Labs spokesperson Michael Azzano characterized the process as ""pretty routine"".  ""This is Ripple Labs looking at some transactions that might run counter to their agreement with Jed,"" he told CoinDesk.  McCaleb, in turn, alleges that the XRP were gifted to family members prior to the finalization of his agreement with Ripple Labs, and therefore, were not subject to this agreement.  ""I am 100% sure I am not in breach of any agreement with Ripple Labs and all evidence will support that,"" he said.  Alleged effort to boost sale  According to the complaint, Ripple Labs told Bitstamp that McCaleb intended to sell the XRP in order to use those funds to underpin a failed effort to sell 650 million stellars, the proceeds of which would then be used to support the development of the Stellar network.  Identified in the complaint are two Ripple addresses, each of which are claimed to be under the control of McCaleb and his family – rUf6pynZ8ucVj1jC9bKExQ7mb9sQFooTPK (cited in the complaint as “rUf6”) and r3Q3B6A2giHDMef83AztzBStBm1JBmxUKX (“r3Q”).  The filing reads:  “On or around March 20, 2015, r3Q offered to sell 98,846,600 XRP on the Bitstamp USD order book, which included the 89,999,900 XRP it received from rUf6 on or around that date and an additional 8,846,700 XRP of the 10m XRP that r3Q had previously received from rUf6 on or around January 6, 2015. On information and belief, this offer was made at McCaleb’s direction and for McCaleb’s and Stellar’s benefit, with the intent to use the funds to purchase STR from the auction STR.”  The same day, the complaint states, Ripple Labs moved to purchase 96,342,361.6 XRP at a cost of $1,038,172. Ripple Labs later told Bitstamp it bought the XRP “in order to avoid and mitigate irreparable harm and damages"".  The filing continues:  ""Ripple Labs’ agent sent the $1,038,172 in purchase funds to r3Q on the Bitstamp gateway. Ripple Labs is demanding the purchase funds back, upon which it has agreed it will return the purchased XRP to rUf6.""  Bitstamp alleged that since the XRP was sold, there have been attempts to use the $1,038,172 to purchase stellars. The funds, according to the filing, have been dispersed to the r3q account as well as two other accounts – rvYAfWj5gh67oV6fW32ZzP3Aw4Eubs59B and rPQB4rgmwoaCjdX4BeoWikeshWL3fLMLD7 – since the sale took place.  Disputed funds frozen  Bitstamp said that on 31st March, it froze those accounts “due to the pending ownership controversy, regulatory and AML concerns and the size and circumstances of the transfers”.  Ripple Labs, the complaint states, is seeking to effectively reverse the transaction by having the $1,038,172 transferred back to its account in exchange for the XRP being transferred back to the rUf6 account.  The filing reads:  “Ripple Labs made a claim to the disputed funds that r3Q is attempting to remove from the Ripple Network and asked Bitstamp to transfer the disputed funds to Ripple Labs’ Ripple account in exchange for Ripple Labs transferring the XRP back to rUf6.”  According to Bitstamp, McCaleb and Nancy Harris – his aunt – have yet to make a formal claim on the funds but that they may opt to do so in the future. The filing added that other unknown parties could try and assert claims over the funds as well.  In addition to asking the court to settle the claims dispute between the different parties, Bitstamp has asked that it be allowed to continue holding the disputed funds until the court makes a judgment on the matter. The company also asked that it be absolved from any future litigation in relation to the disputed funds.

42378129,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MD7j,1427999058,Bitcoin API Startup Gem Raises Funding Total to $3.3 Million,"Californian bitcoin API developer Gem has announced an additional $1.3m in funding, raising its total to $3.3m.  The round was led by KEC Ventureshttp://www.kecventures.com/portfolio/, with additional contributions from First Round Capital, RRE Ventures – also an investor in 21 Inc and Abra – and early Facebook investor Robert Wolfson, among others.  Gem closed its previous round in September last year after receiving funds from Mesa Ventures, Idealab, James Joaquin and Brock Pierce's investment firm, Crypto Currency Partners.  A spokesperson for the platform said the newly acquired funds would be used to accelerate feature development and scale Gem's services for developers worldwide.  Multi-sig wallet  Gem's funding coincides with the launch of its multi-signature wallet API, which is now publicly available following a series of improvements.  Approximately 40% of people using Gem's API are from outside the United States – dispersed throughout Europe, Asia and South America. The new API aims to ease integration for this worldwide user base, while providing added security measures to protect bitcoin wallets and keys.  Ken Miller, COO at Gem, said the security improvements had taken ""massive amounts of time and energy to bring to the market"". However, he added:  ""It just was not an area we were willing to compromise.""  The system now uses Hardware Security Modules (HSMs), physical computing devices that safeguard and manage digital keys for strong authentication and provide crypto-processing.  By implementing FIPS-140-2-Level 3 certified machines, Gem claims that unauthorised access attempts will prompt the device in question to self-destruct.  Competition    ""Getting access to all of that in a few lines of code from our API is pretty differentiating in our opinion,"" said Miller.      The COO commented on what, he believed, set Gem apart from other API providers, which are seeing growing interest from investors:      ""There are some who do parts of what we've built, but for anyone [...] to be able to offer bitcoin capabilities like this in minutes is pretty unheard of at this point.""              Gem faces competition from a growing number of bitcoin APIs in California, including the Boost VC-backed BlockCypher and Chain, which has raised a total of $13.7m from investors including Khosla Ventures and Barry Silbert.      In September last year, one of the best-funded startups in bitcoin, Coinbase, released Toshi, a free API toolkit for bitcoin app developers. This week it published a wishlist for 10 types of companies it would like to see built by developers using its API.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Yessi Bello Perez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/04/02/bitcoin-api-startup-gem-raises-funding-total-to-33-million,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5af60443c92c017d0dc4692e64f2dd4721a846a3-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42378125,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MD3x,1427984922,UBS to Research Blockchain Technology in London Lab,"Swiss investment bank UBS is set to open a London-based research lab to explore the application of blockchain technology in the financial services industry.  The innovation lab, due to open later this month, will be housed at FinTech accelerator Level39 in Canary Wharf – one of London's major business districts.  A group of financial technologists will lead the initiative, which attempts to bring together experts from both the banking and FinTech sectors to examine how traditional banking can drive business growth through innovation.  Oliver Bussmann, group CIO at UBS, said in a statement:  ""Our innovation lab at Level39 will provide a unique platform to explore emerging technologies such as Blockchain and crypto-currencies, and to understand the potential impact for the industry.""  ""We are moving away from a purely in-house innovation strategy, optimising collaboration opportunities with the growing FinTech business, start-up and investor community in an open and transparent way,"" he continued.  The news comes after the Swiss banking giant published an extensive report in March last year outlining the widespread benefits bitcoin's technology could offer if it was co-opted by the traditional banking system.  Britain and FinTech  Level39  , credited with being Europe's largest technology accelerator for the financial and cyber industries, noted the ""far-reaching"" potential of blockchain technologies on its website:  ""[They] have the potential to enable participants to share financial transactions on a common public ledger and therefore enhance transparency and trust while significantly reducing transaction and processing cost.""  The accelerator attracted media attention in August last year when George Osborne, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, withdrew £20 worth of bitcoin from an Robocoin ATM at its London's office during the Innovate Finance conference.

He said: ""My message today is simple: we [Britain] stand at the dawn of new era of banking. Now let's get on with it.""  Following 120 responses to its Call for Information, the UK Treasury unveiled plans to regulate the digital currency industry earlier this month, in conjunction with Osbourne's annual budget speech.

42378121,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MD1R,1427974285,Brawker CEO Cyril Houri Departs in Management Shakeup,"CEO Cyril Houri has left bitcoin buying service Brawker following a management shakeup.      The decentralised platform, which allows bitcoin users to buy ""almost anything"" online at a discount, is now operated by its two-person development team.      Speaking to CoinDesk, the serial entrepreneur said the departure – on ""very friendly terms"" – would give him more time at location technology firm Navizon, which he founded 10 years ago. He added:      ""I am still very interested in the cryptocurrency space and will still keep my eyes open in case I come across another interesting project.""            New development    Gabriel Majoulet, one of the developers behind Brawker, said that the platform's technology would remain unaltered.      ""We will keep maintaining the product the way it is, and focus our work on what makes it a good product: the multi-signature implementation. It is something that the community wants.""              Unlike other implementations, which split keys on company servers, the two private keys used in Brawker transactions are held by the parties themselves. This, Majoulet says, offers superior security to users, as there is no way Brawker – and, by extension, hackers – can access funds in escrow.      This week the company also experienced ""a chain of unforeseen problems"" that interrupted transactions during a migration to a new server. However, the development team insist these issues, which centred around fees, have now been resolved.      Both Majoulet and Houri denied the outage had any connection to the company's restructuring. Majoulet added: ""We will do the support ourselves, we are still learning, but defining new processes today.""

42378137,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MDHn,1427933351,Coinbase Seeks 'Invasive' Details on US Bitcoin Mining Operations,"Coinbase's compliance office is seeking to acquire operational information from bitcoin mining companies in a process that some of the sector's businesses are framing as an infringement on their trade secrets.  MegaBigPower  (MBP) and Bitmain report that Coinbase has asked for detailed information regarding their mining facilities, requesting time-stamped photographs and videos of mining facilities and details about the origin of the hardware the companies operate.  An email dated 25th March sent to MBP owner Dave Carlson and obtained by CoinDesk stated:  “As a followup to our previous inquiry, we need to conduct some additional due diligence. Towards that end, please complete and return the due diligence questionnaire attached to this email, and provide us with verifiable time-stamped images of your mining equipment and key infrastructure elements at your facility.”  The Coinbase representative went on to state that Carlson could be provided with a secure Dropbox to transmit the information.  ""Quite a lot of this information is competitively private information,"" Carlson told CoinDesk.  Carlson said that his company has not used Coinbase in a significant capacity since last summer, though he said that MBP maintains a small account with ""about half a bitcoin"" deposited in that wallet.  Carlson went on to speculate that Coinbase was facing pressure from regulators to gather such information, or that it was seeking details about bitcoin mining for business purposes.  When asked why Coinbase sought this kind of information regarding client mining activities, as well as how the information was relevant to company's service, a spokesperson told CoinDesk:  ""The reason we ask for this information is for consumer protection.""  Detailed request  A questionnaire sent to MBP and provided to CoinDesk included a variety of requests for details about the purchase of hardware components, chip foundry contracts, customer payout receipts, and recent utility bills for its mining facility, among other items.  According to Bitmain's Yoshi Goto, the company received a similar inquiry in the past, which included a request for time-stamped photographs and videos of hardware. Goto went on to suggest that Coinbase has sought such information from other mining companies that use its services.  ""It is not something new that they started to do this,"" he told CoinDesk in an email.  Goto confirmed that Bitmain provided the requested information and said that the request was ""a bit too invasive to the point it would cut into our corporate secrets"".  ""I don't think they are doing a blanket mapping of all the mining operations in the USA,"" Goto added.  New York-based mining company CoinMiner, which is a member of MBP's franchisee program, told CoinDesk that it received a generic request for information a day after MBP received its first email.  Together, the companies are representative of a significant portion of the large, public-facing companies mining bitcoin in the United States.
