42402519,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdK82L,1548440536,NYSE Arca Files Paperwork for Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Approval,"New details have surfaced about the bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposed by Bitwise and NYSE Arca.  Bitwise Asset Management announced its intention to launch the ETF earlier this month. If approved, it would be the first bitcoin ETF to make it to market in the U.S.  At the time, the company said NYSE Arca would file the 19b-4 rule change proposal in the near future. NYSE Arca indeed filed the form the same day, but it does not appear to be listed on any SEC website, possibly due to the ongoing U.S. government shutdown.  As a result, the document went largely unnoticed, despite being posted on NYSE Arca's own website. (An SEC spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)  When Bitwise first announced the ETF proposal, the company said it differed from previous such efforts because a regulated third-party custodian would store the bitcoins. The company also said it would draw pricing data from a large number of exchanges, including both spot and physically settled futures markets, to calculate the index determining the assets' value.  The filed proposal elaborates on the methodology, noting, for example, that these prices will be ""weighted such that bitcoin prices from exchanges with a greater amount of the trading volume in the prior hour are weighted more heavily than bitcoin prices from exchanges with lesser amounts of volume.""  ""The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to protect investors and the public interest,"" the proposal says. In previous ETF rejections, the SEC has highlighted concerns about market manipulation.  NYSE Arca's proposal also touched on concerns about what impact any such manipulation might have on the bitcoin market, stating:  ""... given the fungible nature of bitcoin, the Index Provider believes that the potential impact on Index values of individual exchanges experiencing outside attempts to manipulate either reported volume or reported prices is muted by the use of a large number of exchange price and volume inputs.""  While NYSE Arca has filed the proposal, the clock has not yet started for its approval or rejection. Attorney Jake Chervinsky, of law firm Kobre Kim, told CoinDesk that ""the SEC's deadline for deciding an ETF proposal is triggered by publication in the Federal Register.""  ""That almost certainly won't happen until after the government shutdown ends,"" he said via email. ""According to the SEC’s operations plan, they have discontinued all processing and review of proposed rule changes due to the lapse in appropriations.""  Previous bitcoin ETF proposals have been withdrawn or rejected, with Cboe most recently pulling its joint effort with VanEck and SolidX earlier this week. VanEck CEO Jan van Eck cited the government shutdown as a key reason for this, explaining that the companies were having conversations with the SEC prior to the shutdown, but that these conversations had ceased. However, he said the companies would re-file after the government re-opens.

42402518,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdK84J,1548435603,Security Token Startup Polymath Locks up 75 Million Tokens,"Despite chilly market conditions, one startup is locking up approximately $9 million worth of its tokens for five years.  Polymath, a company best known for advancing the idea of security tokens (those designed explicitly to fit under current securities laws), revealed to CoinDesk that it is locking up 75 million of its POLY tokens. That's 7.5 percent of the total supply, and a quarter of the current circulating supply.  ""A lot of projects have shut down or done major layoffs lately due to lack of funds,"" Polymath cofounder Chris Housser told CoinDesk in an email. ""What we are demonstrating is that our treasury is healthy and we don't have a need for these tokens at this time.""  Treasury management has been a hot topic in the blockchain industry as asset prices have dropped.  ""Thankfully we decided early to diversify a lot of ETH/BTC holdings,"" Housser told us. Polymath raised $58.7 million using a simple agreement for future tokens in January 2018, according to a filing with the SEC.  According to Housser, 74 percent of the locked-up tokens (57 million) will come from those designated for the company and 26 percent (18 million) will come from those designated for the founders. Per the terms of POLY's smart contract, tokens are released for use periodically through 2022, but the team is redirecting part of these to a new smart contract that will hold them until January 1, 2024.  Users spend POLY tokens on the Polymath platform during the process of launching new security tokens. The company says 75 tokens have been created using the platform so far.  Though many things could be tokenized in the future, Housser says the strongest immediate interest appears to be in real estate. He wrote:  ""People really like the idea of fractionalized ownership and the ability to own a piece of something that would be much more difficult to do in the traditional world. With more real-estate-based financial products on the blockchain, there will be greater ability to bundle these products to go long on certain areas and short on others.""  Today also saw news of multiple firms, including Anthony Pompliano's Morgan Creek Digital, backing real-estate tokenization startup RealBlocks.  Limiting token releases or treasury payouts has been viewed positively by the industry. For example, Blockstack has taken a similar path in locking up tokens – though it took a milestone, rather than time-based, approach. The Beijing-based team building the Nebulas blockchain announced last August that it locked up founders tokens for a decade, though it subsequently laid off 60 percent of its staff.  Housser wrote of Polymath:  ""We as a company and founders are committed to the project long-term.""

As reported in The Times of Israel on Friday, investor Zhewen Hu claims in a lawsuit, filed in the Tel Aviv District Court on Jan. 24, that Hogeg had misappropriated some of the crypto millions invested in the firm. The filing also names Yaron Shalem, former CFO at Hogeg’s venture capital firm Singulariteam Ltd. as a defendant, says CTech.  Hu said in the filing that he had invested ether cryptocurrency to the value of roughly $3.8 million in the Stox platform after being convinced by commitments in the firm's white paper that, if it could raise $30 million in ether, it would put the total amount into developing its platform and ultimately boost the price of Stox tokens.  In August of last year, Stox's ICO – notably promoted at the time by boxing champion Floyd Mayweather, Jr. – passed that threshold, raising $34 million, according to The Times.  However, Hu alleges that Hogeg invested just $5 million of the raised funds in Stox and invested the remainder in other ICOs and businesses. The lawsuit also claims Hogeg sold his Stox tokens before a date he had committed to hold them to, thus damaging the value of the tokens still held by investors. The Stox founder has denied any wrongdoing, the article says.  Hogeg is also a co-founder of Sirin Labs, which has built a blockchain smartphone, and chairman of LeadCoin, a blockchain-based business lead sharing network. He also notably bought Beitar Jerusalem Football Club last August 2018 for roughly $7 million.  In another lawsuit in November 2017, Hogeg was accused of stripping the assets of a binary options form, causing it to become become insolvent. He was reported to be countersuing at the time.  Last November, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission settled charges with Floyd Mayweather Jr. for failing to disclose that he had been paid to promote ICOs, including the offering from Stox.

Morgan Creek Digital founder and partner Anthony Pompliano said the primary reason the firm invested in RealBlocks was that its core belief is that “every stock, bond, currency, and commodity will be tokenized at some point in the future.”  Science Inc’s co-founder and managing director Greg Gilman agreed, saying that the real estate market, like other asset classes, will be “increasingly data-driven and digitized"" in the future.  Last month, Morgan Creek Digital also participated in a $4 million investment round of BlockFi, a startup that offers U.S. dollar loans against crypto collateral.

42402493,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJzIE,1548420317,Blockchain Project Polkadot Plans Second Token Sale to Raise $60 Million,"Update (12:10 UTC, Jan. 27 2019): A source familiar with the matter has confirmed the planned fundraising in an email to CoinDesk, saying no new tokens will be issued for the sale.  ---  Blockchain project Polkadot is reportedly seeking to raise up to $60 million through a second token sale.  According to a report from The Wall Street Journal on Thursday citing “people familiar with the matter,” the startup's latest token fundraising effort would bring the value of all its tokens to $1.2 billion, when those not in circulation are included.  Polkadot previously raised more than $145 million via a token sale in October 2017. Soon after, though, it had ether tokens to the value of $98 million frozen due to a bug in Parity wallets. At the time the team asserted: “Our ability to build Polkadot as planned and to the original timetable has not been affected.”  Developed by ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood and overseen by Parity Technologies and the Web3 Foundation, Polkadot is a blockchain interoperability protocol that saw its first proof-of-concept (PoC) go live in May 2018.  The protocol is designed to allow blockchains to communicate with each other and facilitate upgrades automatically without system-wide upgrades or hard forks. A new form of governance was announced last year that passed the decision making to token holders. DOT, the internal token of the Polkadot network, allows holders to vote on potential code changes, which will then automatically upgrade across the network if consensus is reached.  Parity and Web3 have previously said the plan is to officially launch the Polkadot network in the third quarter of 2019.  Parity has been working on building a number of blockchain tools and projects. Last month, it launched Substrate, a platform that lets users create customized blockchains for decentralized applications that is being used to develop the Polkadot protocol.

42402506,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJzT3,1548415217,Bitcoin Awaits Triangle Breakout as Price Squeeze Continues,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) price is largely unchanged on the day and maybe building for a strong exit from the weeks-long period of consolidation.  The leading cryptocurrency hit highs above $4,100 on Jan. 8 before moving lower to around $3,500, where it's become trapped in a tightening trading range.  The bears have persistently failed to keep prices below $3,500, weakening the bearish case put forward by the 9 percent drop seen on Jan. 10. That strong support level has seen the formation of a descending triangle pattern over the last 2.5 weeks, with an upper edge at $3,600 and the base located near $3,500.  Bitcoin is currently trading at $3,550 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.4 percent change on a 24-hour basis.  The probability of a bullish breakout appears high, as the sluggish price action suggests the sellers have run out of steam. Further, prices barely moved following the withdrawal of Cboe's exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposal on Wednesday.  It worth noting that, on Thursday, the trading range (spread between the price high and low) stood near the three-month low of $45.17 registered on Jan. 12. That was the fourth sub-$50 trading range of this month, according to CoinMarketCap..  On the previous three occasions, the trading range widened sharply on the following day, so if history repeats, we may see some movement in the next 12-24 hours.  4-hour chart  A convincing break above $3,600 on the 4-hour chart would confirm a triangle breakout and open the doors to $3,774 (Jan. 19 high). A violation there would expose the psychological hurdle of $4,000.  The descending triangle is widely considered a bearish continuation setup and it often ends up accelerating the preceding move. As a result, a downside break, if confirmed, could prove costly.  View  Bitcoin looks likely to witness a triangle breakout in the next day or two. That would allow a rally to resistance levels lined up at $3,774 and $4,000.  A triangle breakdown – acceptance below $3,470 – would reinforce the primary bearish trend (downward sloping 10-week moving average) and boost the odds of a drop toward December lows near $3,100.

42402499,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJzO8,1548410440,"Bitcoin ATM Startups Say They're Booming, Thanks in Part to Venezuela","The companies behind the world's bitcoin ATM networks say their market is alive and well.  Matias Goldenhörn, director of Latin America operations at the ATM operator Athena Bitcoin, told CoinDesk that such ATMs are “becoming a real alternative to banks” for diverse users in emerging markets.  “The machines have proven resilient to the price fluctuations,” he said.  Indeed, Coin ATM Radar estimates there are now 4,213 cryptocurrency ATM machines deployed worldwide, most of which strictly offer bitcoin, compared to roughly 471 machines worldwide in January 2015. Now that some of these machines also include support for a wide array of digital assets, they offer a conduit for participation in broader cryptocurrency markets without relying solely on web-based exchanges.  Jorge Farias, a Venezuelan expat and CEO of the Panama-based startup Cryptobuyer, told CoinDesk that demand for bitcoin ATMs to support cryptocurrencies like dash and flash is largely driven by sponsored educational initiatives in Latin America – some of which literally give away small amounts of crypto to prospective users in emerging markets like Venezuela, which is currently roiled by crippling financial and political insecurity.  That’s why Farias is preparing to open Venezuela’s first bitcoin ATM in Caracas in early February, which will include support for other cryptocurrencies as well. The machine is already operational. But Farias said for safety reasons it’s important for the current unrest and surging demand for bitcoin to settle down slightly before the public launch.  Moe Adham, cofounder of the crypto ATM retailer BitAccess, told CoinDesk such multi-asset machines provide near-instant liquidity for cryptocurrencies that were otherwise difficult for many users to convert.  “If you earn some other cryptocurrencies through one of these decentralized networks, you can cash it out,” Adham told CoinDesk, adding:  “The bitcoin ATM industry is kind of coming into its own now. … We can provide access to different cryptos with bitcoin as the settlement layer.”  This combination of market demand and new technical capabilities has allowed ATM machines to become an anomaly in the broader industry: a sector where usage and profits are actually growing.  Inflation-driven demand  Although the majority of bitcoin ATMs are currently located in North America, demand from Latin American markets is growing at a breakneck pace, operators say.  According to Goldenhörn, Athena Bitcoin earned $3 million in net profits in 2018, after installing 25 new machines in Latin America, in part because of the Venezuelan diaspora in Colombia and Argentina spreading awareness of how unbanked people can still use bitcoin ATM machines.  “In the U.S., our clients predominantly use our machines to buy bitcoin,” Goldenhörn said. “In Colombia for example, it’s the other way around, people use the ATM to withdraw cash.”  Several of these machines are located inside Latin American Walmart Superstores. If Athena Bitcoin is able to raise a $7 million Series A round – for which the Chicago-based startup is currently fundraising – then Goldenhörn said the plan is to deploy up to 150 new bitcoin ATMs across Latin America in 2019. And his company isn’t the only startup to recognize the opportunity in the region.  When inflation rates in Argentina rose above 46 percent in 2018 – not to mention Venezuela’s staggering economic crisis – Farias raised an undisclosed amount from South African venture capital firm Invictus Capital to launch a new sector of his business with six bitcoin ATMs in Panama.  Farias aims to build a transnational network by working with Lamassu and General Bytes as manufacturing partners and the e-commerce giant MercadoLibre for prime locations, since MercadoLibre has branches across Latin America that allow people to deposit cash for store credit and transfer credits or fiat value to cryptocurrency wallets.  In 2019, Cryptobuyer plans to open 10 more ATMs in Argentina, 10 in Mexico and 10 in Venezuela, since Farias said inflation boosted demand for bitcoin access among local unbanked communities.  “The focus right now is on Mexico and Argentina, which have major immigrant populations from Venezuela,” Farias said. “This lady of 65 years came to one of our [Panama] locations one day with a piece of paper, a QR code printed, and she said to use that her son in Venezuela said with this paper I can send him money.”  For small transaction amounts, this remittance methodology appears to fly under the scope of money transmission regulations in Panama. However, Farias admitted his team is often in contact with local regulators because the compliance landscape could shift in the near future.  “They allow us to work because there isn’t a specific regulation right now, so we are always looking out for new regulations,” he said.  More options  Meanwhile, BitAccess will soon roll out support options for up to 70 tokens across its product lines.  BitAccess co-founder Adham told CoinDesk that aside from bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin and tron saw the most demand from operators and users. He also added that 2018 was the first time his company – originally founded in 2014 – noticed ATM usage was decoupling from the bitcoin’s market volatility.  “The price was decreasing but demand was increasing month over month,” Adham said, speaking of an uptick that has lasted since July 2018.  For example, demand and usage related to BitAccess machines grew more than 9 percent in November 2018, despite bitcoin’s market price sinking below $6,000. Plus, the average buy and sell amounts have both remained relatively constant since March 2018 – around $100 and $250, respectively.  BitAccess’ 242 machines are predominantly located in North America and Europe, with four machines located in Vietnam. Sellers with a more international client base, like the Switzerland-based retailer Lamassu, have also noticed demand is growing more quickly in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America.  “Singapore has been very popular with us, Malaysia as well,” Lamassu CEO Zach Harvey told CoinDesk. “Israel as well, we probably had only one bitcoin ATM until 2018. Now we have 20 machines in Israel.”  Compliance challenges  But as more people use bitcoin ATMs to convert cash and transact across borders, the opaque regulatory landscape presents ever-steeper hurdles.  Last October, Indian police arrested the co-founder of the Indian exchange Unocoin after the company opened a multi-asset cryptocurrency ATM in Bangalore. Unocoin co-founder Sathvik Vishwanath, who has since been released because he did not break any particular law, told CoinDesk that police confiscated the machine because it was unclear whether operators required a license.  “We await the judgment regarding the lifting of this restriction by the Supreme Court,” Vishwanath said, adding that he expects a ruling by the end of February.  Such regulatory complexities are compounded by questions about whether certain cryptocurrencies classify as unregistered securities according to local laws.  In Adham’s case, he said that although BitAccess is merely a retailer and responsibility lies with owners and operators, his company still worked with legal counsel to review tokens and make sure ATM machines only supported assets that were already accessible on other platforms in each jurisdiction.  “Then the question of securitization is very scary,” Adham said, adding:  “There’s not anyone who is entirely certain of where the cards are going to fall on this. … Are there other reputable companies that are offering these tokens? And do they have clearly listed statements about why they are listed?”  Both Harvey and Goldenhörn said they also have to take a unique approach to compliance in each jurisdiction and created a legal review process for both themselves and their partners, even if the burden of responsibility eventually falls on another operator or landlord.  “These systems, which started out as very simple, are becoming very, very complex,” Harvey said, noting that Lamassu machines offer the ability for operators to support ethereum, bitcoin cash, zcash, litecoin and dash. “Depending on which jurisdiction you’re in, there are different demands.”  All things considered, Adham said that his company was “cash flow positive” for the past four quarters and growing demand creates economic incentives to innovate in this space.  “I don’t think that compliance is the No. 1 hindrance,” he said. The biggest challenge, in his mind, is finding and targeting sources of real demand.

42402495,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJzKC,1548407717,"Levi Strauss, Harvard Trial Ethereum Tech to Track Factory Workers' Welfare","Harvard University, jeans giant Levi Strauss and U.S. think-tank New America are investigating blockchain as a means to improve labor welfare.  New America announced Thursday that the U.S. Department of State has granted $800,000 for a pilot project that will develop a blockchain-based system to track the working conditions of factory workers.  The first phase of the project will be launched in the second quarter of this year to “anonymously and securely” track three factories in Mexico producing goods for Levi Strauss and employing a combined 5,000 workers. The scheme will monitor the workforce across the factories, tracking conditions and individuals' health and well-being.  The blockchain system will be developed by ethereum development studio ConsenSys based on a well-being index from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health’s – the Sustainability and Health Initiative for NetPositive Enterprise (SHINE).  SHINE director Dr. Eileen McNeely said that most blockchain uses cases for the supply chain industry revolve around tracking materials, so building a solution for tracking human conditions is an “exciting innovation with broad potential for positive impact on worker well-being worldwide.”  Basing the pilot on ethereum will create a ""transparent environment for workers to securely and anonymously share critical information,” according to ConsenSys founder Joe Lubin.  “Our goal is to develop, test, and scale a system that could empower employees, suppliers, and consumers to make informed decisions about factories, products, and brands,” he said.  The participants are already planning a second phase of the pilot – slated for launch in 2020.  Last week, in a similar development, IBM announced two separate supply chain projects, built on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform, aimed to spot illegal activity like child labor in the metals industry. One is designed to track cobalt traveling from a mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo to a Ford plant, while the other seeks to monitor metal shipments from a mine in Mexico.

42413904,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAmcve,1548392408,"When Bitcoin ETF? Not Any Time Soon, But Maybe by 2020","For the first time in more than a year, there are no active bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposals pending before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Money manager VanEck, financial services firm SolidX and Cboe BZX Exchange withdrew a highly-anticipated proposal Tuesday, citing an ongoing U.S. government shutdown as the reason. The proposal, first filed last June, faced a final deadline of February 27 for approval or rejection. Due to the shutdown, many legal experts anticipated that the SEC would reject the proposal outright rather than let it be approved by default.  VanEck CEO Jan van Eck said the companies will ""re-file and re-engage in the discussions"" with the SEC when the shutdown ends, he did not provide a timeline for when this may happen. And indeed, it is unclear when the government will reopen – while the U.S. Senate was set to vote on two different bills that could potentially re-open the government, neither bill passed.  Other companies are also hesitant to file for a bitcoin ETF while the regulator is in a state of limbo. Bitwise Asset Management announced its intention to file for a fund with NYSE Arca earlier this month, and while NYSE Arca has submitted the required rule change proposal, the SEC has not yet published the document for review in the Federal Register.  Proponents of the fund hope a regulated bitcoin ETF, once approved, will bring in new investors, boosting bitcoin's liquidity and potentially even pumping its price.  Any day now?  There are also nine different rule change proposals for ETFs that are in a state of limbo.  The proposals, filed by ProShares, Direxion and GraniteShares, were rejected last year by the SEC staff, who cited concerns about bitcoin market manipulation. But a review of that decision by the commission was called for the next day.  However, while the SEC must stick to strict deadlines when initially examining a rule change proposal, there are no such deadlines for a review, attorney Jake Chervinsky told CoinDesk. These reviews have taken anywhere from six to 16 months in the past, but are also suspended while the SEC is closed.  Hence, a decision on any of these nine proposals could happen as soon as the government re-opens, or it could drag on for months or even, theoretically, years.  Glimmer of hope  It is possible that an ETF may still be approved by the end of the year, Chervinsky told CoinDesk via email, though he added that it ""will depend on (1) when the ETF proposal is filed and (2) the state of the bitcoin markets when the SEC makes its decision.""  Once a proposal is filed, the SEC has 240 days to approve or deny it, should the regulator take every extension allowable under the law. As such, any proposal filed by May 5, 2019 at the latest would require a final decision before December 31, Chervinsky explained.  He added that he would be ""surprised"" if at least one proposal was not published within that time.  ""The question will then be whether the bitcoin markets mature enough before the SEC makes its decision to adequately address all the issues that have killed ETF proposals in the past, such as valuation, liquidity, custody, and market manipulation,"" Chervinsky said, concluding:  ""In my view, it’s entirely possible that another [10] months of development in the cryptocurrency ecosystem could be enough to finally warrant approval of a bitcoin ETF.""
