20700217,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562476,1700946046,"XRP Price May Recapture 61,000% Surge Seen In 2017, Analyst Claims","Prominent crypto analyst CryptoInsightUK has given his thoughts on whether or not the XRP price can replicate the notable 61,000% gain it enjoyed back in 2017. Although the analyst sounded uncertain about how things could pan out, he provided insight as to what the future holds for XRP. XRP Price Repeating 61,000% Move Will Be Harder In a post on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, CryptoInsightUK highlighted how XRP exploded in 2017. The crypto token is said to have seen a 61,000% gain in 280 days. As to whether a repeat can happen, he mentioned that it would be harder as the market cap would have to be huge. He didn’t rule it out, though, as it would be possible with “real-world utility.” Related Reading: Analyst Sounds Warning: This Might Be Your Last Chance To Buy Bitcoin Below $40,000 The crypto analyst seemed to be more focused on talking about the XRP price potential rather than talking about how high the token could rise. He alluded to the hate that XRP receives and how when people feel such a way, there is probably “value” in that asset. He also highlighted other factors that make the token stand out. CryptoInsightUK mentioned that “XRP has had another 3 years of consolidation to most other cryptos.” This places the token on a higher pedestal as it bounded to enjoy greater expansion from a technical analysis angle. The analyst also spoke about how XRP is the only crypto token that has overtaken ETH in market cap on more than one occasion. On one of them, it enjoyed about 20% market share in the total crypto market cap. The crypto analyst was quick to disclaim whether that meant he was suggesting that the XRP price could achieve these feats again. He stated that only time will tell as he wasn’t making any point but only sharing his thoughts. XRP’s Unique Offerings And Positioning In his post, CryptoInsightUK also mentioned that “XRP is in a unique position.” He was referring to how XRP “is the only altcoin that has legal clarity.” This clarity comes from Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling that XRP is not a security in itself. That is another factor that he believes makes XRP stand out, considering that the regulatory landscape is only just building up. Related Reading: Valour XRP ETP Set To Begin Trading, Can Institutional Inflows Drive Price To $10? Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty had previously echoed similar sentiments when he mentioned how Judge Torres’ ruling helped XRP attain a unique status. He specifically mentioned the fact that XRP was now “uniquely classified” as a non-security in the US. The unique status is more significant considering that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continue a host of crypto token as securities.

The analysis indicates around $70 billion in new money flowing into Bitcoin, potentially setting the stage for a BTC price rally. Bitcoin Spot ETF Set To Ignite New Inflows Blockchain data and intelligence provider, Glassnode has recently published research insights on the potential impacts of Bitcoin Spot ETF approvals on the price of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. The on-chain analytics company has predicted about $70.5 billion flowing into Bitcoin from increased demand from institutional investors. Related Reading: Crypto Fund Exits BLUR For Lido And IMX—Endorsing DeFi? Glassnode bases its analysis on the assumption that substantial portions of capital invested in the stocks, bonds, and gold market might shift toward Bitcoin investments. The blockchain analytics firm has stated that this influx of new capital could have a huge effect on the Bitcoin market, potentially driving its price to greater levels. “Based on these assumptions, we estimate approximately $60.6 billion could flow into Bitcoin from the combined stock and bond ETFs, and about $9.9 billion from the gold market, totaling around $70.5 billion in potential new capital influx,” Glassnode stated. It added: “This significant infusion of new capital could have a considerable impact on Bitcoin’s market, potentially driving up its price as it gains broader acceptance and becomes integrated into more traditional investment portfolios.” Bitcoin Futures And Altcoins Soar On BTC ETF Hype Glassnode has extended its analysis to examine how Spot Bitcoin ETF applications are influencing Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Bitcoin futures and various altcoins. The blockchain analytics firm has stated that the recent crypto market recovery has been driven by the surrounding anticipation of Spot Bitcoin ETF potential approval by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $37.696. Chart: TradingView.com “The market’s upward trajectory was largely driven by the anticipation of Spot BTC ETF approvals, with market movements significantly influenced by updates on filings from major financial entities like Invesco and BlackRock,” Glassnode stated. The on-chain analysis firm revealed that the growing optimism in Spot Bitcoin ETFs has caused a notable increase in Bitcoin futures on CME. According to the blockchain intelligence provider, CME Bitcoin futures rose to an all-time high of 27.8%, exceeding Binance for the first time since the start of the crypto bear market. Various other altcoins like Ethereum and Solana also experienced staggering price increases. Solana surged by 79.05%, and Ethereum’s price is presently above the $2000 mark. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Rockets Past $38,000, Hits Highest Peak Since May 2022 – Details The most notable increase caused by the ongoing hype on Spot Bitcoin ETFs was seen in Bitcoin. BTC surged above $37,000 as the optimism of regulator approvals for the first Spot Bitcoin ETF spread. Additionally, institutional engagement in open interest in Bitcoin call options also rose by $4.3 billion, marking an 80% increase to surpass $9.7 billion.

20690983,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562460,1700926564,VESA at Cypher Capital,"Hi BitFam, Today we’re celebrating a union that took place recently when VESA travelled to Dubai for a month of meetings, partnership calls, keynotes, and conferences. A juicy sized catalogue of VESA works moved into the Cypher Capital Hub in October and this time, we want to celebrate this incredible handshake and share the stories behind the artworks you can see on the walls. In their own words, Cypher Capital is focused on investing in Web3 infrastructure and applications that will drive the digital economy in the future. The Cypher Capital Hub in Marina is shaping up to be one of the sleekest and most functional spots to work, meet and network. The Hub has always been a place for art, most notably two works by Banksy in the main conference room – now featuring a VESA as well. Let’s dive into the stories behind the pieces you can see on the walls of the Hub! Next time you stop by the Hub, please snap a picture of yourself and your favourite VESA work and tag: Cypher Capital Group / Vesa Kivinen // LinkedIn Cypher.capital / artbyvesa // Instagram Refresh has an honorary place at the VIP room alongside two Banksy pieces. Link to tweet Integration First VESA piece you see on the wall as you walk into the space is Integration. The piece represents the dichotomy of worldviews present in our society in relationships between men and women. On the one hand women occupy positions of power like never before and work incredibly hard to pursue and execute those positions. On the other hand, there is a view that supports tearing down all structures of hierarchy in capitalism and science, as they are seen as an oppressive force, rather than a liberating one. Integration was exhibited at Art Dubai 2022 via the Morrow Collective. Million Dirham Hotel Residing in the sleek meeting room, is the Million Dirham Hotel. The work is a part of the larger Mirrors- series, which explores value, experiences, and identity. Million Dirham Hotel evokes images of what a hotel with such a high-ticket price would look like. It is an invitation to a world that challenges the ownership vs access paradigm. The Million Dirham Hotel, like all works in the Mirrors- series entices the viewer with its offering of leveraging IP unseen in the traditional art market. Download the Artivive app and experience the AR version, when you stop by. Truth or Dare- the Currency of Ganesha Next to The Million Dirham Hotel is Truth or Dare- The Currency of Ganesh, or Ganesh for short. This work belongs to the pantheon of VESA’s early crypto art, inspired by the thousands of years old Hindu tradition of faith and worldview. Lord Ganesh is revered as the remover of obstacles, the patron of arts and sciences and a higher being of intellect and wisdom. In this piece, Lord Ganesh and his entourage have assimilated cryptocurrency symbols and blockchain code alongside traditional wealth displays. Gold, platinum, and diamonds hold a historical place in our minds as keepers of value, but as an example the smart contracts layered on top of Ethereum are building the wealth of today and tomorrow. Ganesh is probably THE most complicated work VESA has ever made. It took over 2000 layers of photography of individual paintings and other images before Ganesh started taking shape. Red Eye Red Eye shows the reality of someone falling into the rabbit hole of crypto. The whirlwind seems endless, and the new information pouring into your consciousness sometimes claims your ability to sleep. This piece is another one with stunning merits, as it was featured in Forbes in their first ever article on this new movement of art and money in January 2019. Red Eye was also exhibited at the opening of the immersive Dubai gallery Art In Space. It launces into its AR version via the Artivive app to showcase motion and sound. Compound Defiance On the way to the VIP room, you can see Compound Defiance on the wall. This work is steeped in legendary moments and is a part of crypto art history. The fluid motion forming a solid symbolizes the decentralized financial system that has no point of central control and therefore free to define its own rules. This freedom has its positives and negatives, but more options mean a more expansive, rather than repressive experience. The jarring pattern blending endlessly might seem chaotic at first, before the beautiful pattern presents its holistic face. Compound Defiance was the first artwork used on a street legal NFT VESA Art Car in Dubai and it has a VR version made by Zoan. Refresh Residing in the elegant VIP room, is a piece made in honour of the UAE, called Refresh. It was made in 2020 and it represents the forward-thinking, technologically competent, and culturally mesmerizing country in an artistic way. The round planet in the centre of the piece is Mars, referencing the Emirati space program. Galloping alongside is a tokenized royal horse, modelled after a real-life specimen. The two people featured are the CEO of the Dubai Blockchain Centre, Dr. Marwan Al Zarouni and his wife, Mariam Al Zarouni. In the artwork, the two are immersed in the Bitcoin genesis code, as they witness the evolution of their country. Refresh comes alive with the Artivive app. It has an original soundtrack, and it has been exhibited on large stages in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, as well as extensively in crypto media. You can find the hub here in Dubai. Team VESA wants to thank Cypher Capital for showcasing these works!

20690509,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562407,1700925610,"Dogecoin (DOGE) Set For Major Price Upswing, Analyst Says","In the last week, DOGE, alongside other cryptocurrencies, suffered a significant price dip following reports of US enforcement action on the world’s largest exchange, Binance, and the company’s CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao. In particular, DOGE recorded a cumulative price loss of 6.85%, ranking as one of the biggest losers in the last seven days, according to data from CoinMarketCap. However, there are some positive developments regarding the meme coin, which indicate that investors may soon record a significant price gain. Related Reading: Big Money Returns To Dogecoin: Rally To $0.2 Already Programmed? DOGE Record Transactions Worth Over $100,000 – Price Gain Imminent? In an X post on November 23, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared that the DOGE market recorded $100,000 in transactions in the past month based on data from In The Block. According to Martinez, this development marks a rising interest in DOGE from major institutional players as well as crypto whales, which means the maiden meme coin could be set for a price boost soon. Providing more insight into this positive trend in the DOGE market, blockchain analytics firm Santiment reported that 121 new wallets containing over 1 million DOGE have been created in the last month, terming it “a Sign of Big Money Interest.” Santiment noted that Dogecoin has also recently recorded its largest spike in activity from dormant wallets, which indicates an incoming reversal of the token’s price trend, which is currently negative. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin About To Reverse? Key Factors To Watch Behind DOGE’s Rise In Transaction – Dogecoin Co-Founder Weighs In In explaining the driving force behind increasing Dogecoin transactions, the token’s founder Billy Markus, with the X username Shibetoshi Nakamoto pointed out the introduction of ordinals and shitcoins. This information was revealed in a separate post on X in response to a crypto enthusiast who highlighted the “parabolic” trend in the number of transactions on the Dogecoin network. DOGE Ordinals, popularly known as “Doginals,” are quite similar to the Bitcoin Ordinals. They are referred to as DRC-20 token standards, which allow users to inscribe information on the smallest individual units of a Dogecoin, i.e., shibes. With the DRC-20 standard, DOGE users can now create non-fungible tokens (NFTs) supported by the Dogecoin network. Understandably, this has led to a substantial rise in the transactions on the Dogecoin network. While this development marks an increased network adoption, which could attract investors, the increase in transactions is also accompanied by high network fees, which may drive away network users.

PlanB made a call to action based on his analysis of Bitcoin’s realized price, as all signs point to Bitcoin going on a strong price surge very soon. Enjoy Sub-$40,000 Bitcoin While It Lasts Bitcoin has outperformed other asset classes in terms of price performance this year.

According to his analysis of the realized price model, this could be the last chance to buy Bitcoin under $40,000. Realized price refers to the average price of all Bitcoin currently in circulation. Some experts argue this is a better measure of Bitcoin’s value than the current market price. Bearish markets are usually characterized by a higher realized price than the spot price of Bitcoin. Bullish markets, on the other hand, are characterized by a higher spot market price. A look at the realized price shared by the analyst shows that the spot price of Bitcoin is now trading above the overall realized cost price, the 2-year realized price, and the 5-month realized price.

It looked like the crypto exchange had benefited from Binance’s recent legal problems. People have noticed that COIN’s price has been doing well in line with the overall good trend in the crypto space led by Bitcoin. This week, the price of Coinbase stock has been going up quickly because its competitor, Binance, is having some problems with the government. COIN has been soaring for five days in a row and hit a four-month high of $114.4 as a result. But if you look at the chart for the daily time frame, you can see that this rebound is part of a rising channel. This means that the asset is ready for another surge. The Nasdaq-listed Coinbase stock reached an 18-month high on Friday. The prices of Ethereum and Bitcoin are also rising. The price of a COIN share was $115.75 at the time of this writing, up almost 7% in the last 24 hours. It has almost reached $117 per share so far today. Just one month ago, COIN was worth $82 per share, but now it’s worth over 40% more. Source: TradingView According to data provided by on-chain research company CryptoQuant, the US exchange’s bitcoin reserves have recently shot up, while Binance’s have fallen. Over the past several months, Coinbase has become even more of a major player in the digital currencies sector, even as other companies in the same field have gone out of business. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Rockets Past $38,000, Hits Highest Peak Since May 2022 – Details The exchange’s solid track record has been a key part of its success, especially since it promotes a strong compliance-first approach after rivals like Binance have had major run-ins with the law. This week, Binance admitted to being guilty of money theft in federal court. The company decided to pay fines of $4.3 billion, and Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, the founder and CEO, also admitted guilt and said he would resign. The news somehow benefited its rival, Coinbase, as seen from the decent numbers it has so far tallied. Total crypto market cap at $1.4 trillion on the weekly chart: TradingView.com As of November, the price of Coinbase stock has made an impressive rebound, coming back strongly from a psychological support level of $70. In the last few days, this upward trend has pushed the price of the asset to a remarkable $115, which is a 62% climb. Based in San Francisco, the Nasdaq has listed Coinbase as a public company since 2021. The last time COIN was worth this much was in May 2022, just before the bubble burst for Terra and most of the digital asset economy crumbled along with it. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Rockets Past $38,000, Hits Highest Peak Since May 2022 – Details Analysts said that the Binance legal ruling could also be good for Coinbase because it could make it easier for US regulators to grant permission for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). A Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of investment trust fund that lets buyers benefit from changes in the price of Bitcoin without actually holding the cryptocurrency itself. It works like a regular stock on a stock market, helping investors buy and sell shares that give them ownership in the Bitcoin ETF. Bitcoin is what the ETF is based on, and its value is linked to the success of the crypto asset. Meanwhile, as COIN surges to an 18-month high, nearing the $117 mark, speculation arises about the possibility of it reaching $150. The impressive rally showcases the platform’s resilience and market confidence. Investors are keenly observing whether this upward momentum will persist, potentially propelling Coinbase to new heights. The crypto community awaits eagerly, anticipating whether COIN will continue its ascent towards the speculated $150 milestone. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice.

The altcoin breached the $2,100 mark on Friday, November 24, with its sights now set on new yearly highs. Interestingly, a recent on-chain revelation has shown what could be behind the latest ETH price surge while offering insights into the future prospects of the cryptocurrency. On-Chain Data Shows Whales Continue To Buy ETH Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez, in a post on X, revealed that Ethereum whales have been active in the crypto market over the past few days. According to on-chain data from Glassnode, ETH whales have been accumulating the altcoin for nine consecutive days. Ethereum whales increase balance for nine days in a row | Source: Ali_charts/X Related Reading: Ethereum Outperforms Bitcoin: Is The Altcoin Season Officially On? Notably, Martinez highlighted that this is the first 9-day accumulation spree in over nine months. Furthermore, the crypto analyst noted that “the increasing buying pressure could be a strong signal for ETH bullish price action.” Changes in whale accumulation are often closely monitored in the cryptocurrency space because of how large crypto holders can influence the market dynamics. The steady buying pressure displayed by Ethereum whales over the past nine days suggests a growing optimism amongst this class of investors. Another analyst offered a similar on-chain perspective to the growing accumulation by Ethereum whales. The crypto pundit revealed – via a post on X – that the 200 largest Ethereum wallets now hold a collective 62.76 million ETH (worth about $132.1 billion). According to data provided by Santiment, this whale class has accumulated 30.3% more coins since November 21, 2022. Additionally, these 200 largest Ethereum addresses hold about 52% of Ether’s circulating supply. Ethereum Price – Where Next? While Ethereum’s price broke above the $2,100 mark on Friday, it has since retraced below the price level. However, there is much optimism around a continuous upward movement for ETH, especially as it still trades above the significant $2,044 resistance zone. Many investors might want to keep an eye on the cryptocurrency’s price action by the end of the week, though. According to an analyst, a close above $2,130 on the weekly timeframe will be pivotal for Ethereum’s price trajectory.

Breaking the $38,000 barrier in the early stages of the New York trading session on Friday, the cryptocurrency sector, witnessed the long-anticipated surge. Bitcoin’s recent consolidation within a pennant pattern had hinted at the prospect of a bullish upswing, and it seems those predictions have materialized. Related Reading: BLUR Token Rules Today’s Top 100 Crypto Ranking With 88% Rally – Details Bitcoin Price Hits Highest Peak Since 2022 Bitcoin’s rally also occurred following the Thanksgiving holiday in the US, marking its highest point since May 2022. This surge took place in the face of subdued activity in conventional markets. Although the top coin has experienced a slight pullback, it still holds a 1.5% gain for the day. Traders are incredibly excited by Friday’s surge in Bitcoin’s price, which has rekindled the fear of missing out (FOMO) feeling. Because of this spike, Bitcoin may be able to reach the next major resistance level, which is located at about $42,000, in the next few weeks. Still so far, so good on #Bitcoin.

The US Department of Justice and Binance reached an agreement, which is undoubtedly the most significant development of the month. Changpeng Zhao was forced to resign as the CEO of the company, and the exchange was forced to pay a punishment totaling around $4.3 billion. Binance, the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, has named Richard Teng as its new CEO. Bitcoin poised to reclaim the $38K territory today. Chart: TradingView.com Bitcoin Circulating Supply In Profit Region A recent uptick in market liquidations is another important component impacting the Bitcoin price. Long and short position liquidations have increased significantly across different time frames, with a total of $80.29 million in liquidations in the last 24 hours, according to statistics from Coinglass. Related Reading: Analyst’s Crystal Ball: XRP Bulls Eyeing $40 Price Target, Despite Doubts Source: Coinglass In a related development, during last week’s gain, the proportion of Bitcoin’s circulating supply that is currently in profit hit 84%, or 16.36 million BTC. Additionally, Glassnode noted that this is historically noteworthy because it is significantly higher than the 74% all-time mean number. With #Bitcoin trading at yearly highs above $37k last week, over 83% of the coin supply was driven back into profitable territory. However, the magnitude of unrealized profit remains modest, and is not yet sufficient for long-term investors to divest.https://t.co/IGJpglF20J — glassnode (@glassnode) November 22, 2023 Meanwhile, further fueling the positive outlook is the heightened expectation surrounding the potential approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. With a looming deadline of January 10, the SEC is tasked with evaluating numerous pending applications for these ETFs. If given the green light, these ETFs are poised to provide investors with a more cost-effective avenue to tap into the Bitcoin market, adding another layer of optimism to the current bullish sentiment.

20663587,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562365,1700870424,Crypto Fund Exits BLUR For Lido And IMX—Endorsing DeFi?,"According to Lookonchain data, Sigil, a fund in Gibraltar, has exited BLUR, one of this week’s top-performing tokens, for Lido DAO’s LDO, and IMX, the native token Immutable X–a layer-2 scaling solution primarily dedicated to NFT trading. Sigil Fund Sells BLUR For IMX And LDO On November 24, Lookonchain, a crypto analytics platform, noted that Sigil sold 1.55 million BLUR for 807,799 IMX, worth roughly $1.14 million, and 210,905 LDO, trading at $540,000, at spot rates. The exchange was made via multiple transactions and done on-chain. The swap comes roughly three days after Sigil withdrew 3.1 BLUR from OKX, a cryptocurrency exchange. Surprisingly, the fund is exiting BLUR when the token has dominated performance in the last few trading days. Related Reading: Ripple CEO Offers Perspective On Legal Fallout With The SEC To quantify, the token has more than doubled this week alone, surging to register new H2 2023 highs above $0.60. BLUR is already up 330% from its 2023 lows and continues to edge higher on rising trading volume. The Gibraltar-based crypto investment fund’s rotation from BLUR into core governance tokens of Lido DAO and Immutable X comes when there is FOMO around the 300 million BLUR airdrop in Season 2. Still, it is not immediately clear what might have advised the fund to exit BLUR–and not simply ride the current ride–for LDO and IMX. In retrospect, the shift could be an endorsement of decentralized finance’s (DeFi) resilience and inherent growth prospects. The rotation of funds into DeFi tokens could also signify a focus on backing decentralized ecosystem building rather than speculative NFT mania, as is currently the case with BLUR, which is rapidly rising, spurred by the Season 2 airdrop. LDO and IMX Are Key For DeFi And NFT As of November 2023, Lido DAO and Immutable X are some of the core platforms driving crypto and DeFi. Lido DAO plays a crucial role in Ethereum staking, while Immutable X offers a secure NFT trading infrastructure. Though recent troubles at FTX and other CeFi actors like FTX’s partner, Alameda Research, continue to cap upsides, Sigil’s allocation change is an endorsement for DeFi.

For now, it remains on an uptrend but is generally volatile and not galloping higher like BLUR. The token is up 80% from October 2023 lows at press time. Meanwhile, IMX is extending gains at 2023 highs, looking at price action in the daily chart.
