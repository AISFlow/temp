Some crypto investors are beginning buy more bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies, despite recent bad market news, he said.  ""I think you're seeing that more of the hodler money is starting to increase their exposure and add to their positions. There is a chance that the crypto winter could be over,"" he said during ""All About Bitcoin.""  He spoke after last week’s market wipeout, which dashed hopes of an immediate bitcoin price recovery from the market crash earlier this year. Analysts at the crypto research firm Delphi Digital wrote Monday in a report that if bitcoin follows the pattern from previous historical price cycles, it might fall as low as $10,000 before finally heading higher.  The key is whether bitcoin “continues to show” that it won’t reflect “stock market weakness on steroids when we have risk-aversion days,” Moya said.  Crypto may not be out of “choppy” waters for the next few months, Moya added. But if risk appetite for bitcoin continues to grow, “we could see the momentum really come into place and take crypto much higher.”  Moya’s comments come ahead of the Federal Reserve’s economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to give a speech addressing inflation on Friday.  “The majority of Wall Street, especially hedge funds, [are] anticipating some pain in the stock market” after Powell's remarks, which could give a hint as to how high the next interest rate hike could be. That, in turn, could “weigh on crypto,” Moya said.

42373998,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWhCv,1661286771,Market Wrap: Crypto Assets Rise Following Soft Home Sales in July,"Price Action  Crypto Assets Rose Following Soft Home Sales in July  Most crypto assets ended the day higher on Tuesday after new home sales fell 12.6% in July from the month before, the slowest pace since July 2016.  Bitcoin was recently trading 2% higher following the soft economic news and ether was up 4.8%. The tokens of blockchains Polkadot (DOT) and Avalanche (AVAX) traded more than 4% higher over the past 24 hours.  This article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  The drop in home sales offers the latest evidence that the U.S. Federal Reserve’s more aggressive approach to taming inflation is slowing the economy without casting it into a recession.  ""Bad macro news continues to be good news, so lackluster U.S. home sales data makes for a more dovish Fed, a weaker U.S. dollar and a strong crypto complex,"" said Joshua Lim, head of derivatives at Genesis Trading.(Genesis is owned by Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)  Crypto assets started the week rattled as most traders focused on the Federal Reserve’s economic policy symposium that kicks off on Thursday. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to give a speech on Friday at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's annual Jackson Hole, Wyoming, economic symposium that could give a hint to the central bank's thinking on future interest rates.  Traders are hoping for positive news. Last week’s minutes from July’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting left traders in suspense as to what the Fed’s path forward will look like in detail – specifically in September when the central bank will likely raise interest rates again.  In anticipation of the annual symposium, most crypto assets fell Monday, although that bearish sentiment weakened during U.S. trading hours on Tuesday, which was likely a result of the new home sale data.  The CME FedWatch Tool, which gauges investor sentiment about monetary policy, strongly indicates traders are increasingly unsure of what to believe. A day ago, traders were betting on a 57% chance that members of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's rate-setting body, would hike rates by another 75 basis points.  But on Tuesday, expectations flipped with investors betting on a 58.5% chance of a 50-basis point hike are dominating, which is approximately the same predication as a week ago.  Both a 50 and 75 basis point rate hike would most likely hurt markets, which have interpreted recent comments by central bankers as dovish. Another 75 basis point hike would signal that the Fed is more worried about rising prices than it was earlier this month following the release of unexpectedly favorable Consumer Price Index (CPI) data showing inflation slowing.  Bitcoin has fallen almost 12% over the past week, including a 10% plunge on Friday.

Featured Story  Exchange Giant CME’s Bitcoin Futures Just Hit a Huge Discount to Spot Prices  By Lyllah Ledesma  Bitcoin futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, one of the world’s biggest derivatives markets, just traded at the largest discount to spot prices in at least 2 1/2 years after a big market plunge and right before August contracts expire.  Arcane Research keeps tabs on the average difference between CME’s front-month bitcoin futures – those expiring soonest – and the current market price for bitcoin itself for rolling one-month periods. On Monday, that showed front-month futures at a 3.36% discount. That’s a record low in the firm’s dataset that goes back to Jan. 1, 2020 – though CME bitcoin futures have been trading since December 2017.  That surpassed the previous low of minus 2.39% set on July 21, 2021, which was followed by a hefty short squeeze, according to Arcane.  CME futures have traded at a discount over the last two months but witnessed a short-lived recovery at the start of the month when there was some momentum in the market. Early in August, bitcoin briefly reached $25,000. But it sank below $21,000 on Aug. 19.  “The growing discounts in the front-month contracts might be explained in part by structural effects,” Vetle Lunde, an analyst at Arcane Research, said in a report.  The report said the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) has begun rolling its August contracts into contracts that expire later, possibly causing downward pressure on the front-month contracts. Monday, BITO rolled over 1,000 August contracts and will roll over a further 3,000 August contracts by Friday. Previous times when the exchange-traded fund rolled over exposures, front-month contracts have tended to move toward discounts to spot, according to Arcane.  “Still, such extreme discounts have not appeared during previous rolling periods,” Lunde said. “They might be a symptom of worsening liquidity or general de-risking as S&P 500 and Nasdaq see a tumultuous start to the week while the dollar strength index pushes towards new highs.”     Altcoin roundup  Bankrupt Crypto Lender Celsius Sues Prime Trust Over $17M in Tokens: The dispute stems from a trove of assets held by Prime Trust for Celsius customers in New York and Washington.Read more here.

42373994,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWh7t,1661284326,"As Censorship on Ethereum Begins, Could This Open-Sourced Code Help Counter It?","Flashbots, the team of developers behind MEV-Boost, a critical piece of software for the next phase of Ethereum, has decided to accelerate the open-sourcing of some of its code as the broader Ethereum community frets over looming risks of transaction censorship.  The move comes in reaction to the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) banning Americans from using Tornado Cash, a service that anonymizes transactions, because it abetted money laundering. It also followed the arrest of Alexey Pertsev, who wrote the code for the mixer, banning Americans from using Tornado Cash.  Read more: Are Crypto Mixers Legal?  MEV-Boost is an optional piece of software which, come the Ethereum Merge to proof-of-stake (PoS) in September, will separate “builders” who create blocks of transactions from the “proposers” who propagate those blocks out to the wider network.  Flashbots pitches its software as a way to help validators – the computers that process transactions on Ethereum’s PoS network – more easily (and equitably) extract Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), extra income that validators can earn by strategically selecting the transactions that they add to a given block.  But Flashbots sparked controversy last week after confirming that it would censor the default “relay” it uses to pass pre-built blocks from builders to proposers. In order to comply with OFAC sanctions, the Flashbots relay will exclude transactions involving addresses linked to Tornado Cash and other OFAC-sanctioned addresses.  Read more: Are Block Builders the Key to Solving Ethereum’s MEV Centralization Woes?  In response to community backlash, the team announced in a blog post that it would aim to get its relay code into developers’ hands earlier than planned. This will make it easier for third-party relays – rather than Flashbots’ own default relay – to launch with MEV-Boost this fall.  While Flashbots’ default relay will comply with OFAC sanctions, these third-party relays will be able to handle sanctioned addresses however they’d prefer.  The Ethereum community responds  How Ethereum developers and the community as a whole would handle network censorship was the elephant in the room during last week’s All Core Developers Meeting.  Indeed, it appears that some miners on the current PoW chain have already begun excluding non-compliant transactions.  Micah Zoltu, the founder of Serv.eth Support, a support service specializing in Ethereum decentralized applications (dapps), led the topic of censorship on the call. In a conversation with CoinDesk, he remarked that the outcry around Flashbots’ decision to censor transactions was a wake up call for other relay providers. Now, Zoltu expects most relay providers to offer censorship-free relay options, and he thinks validators will prefer to run these non-censored relays.  Zoltu told CoinDesk that DeFi services firm bloXroute, for example, will run three relays: two that won’t censor, and one that will censor OFAC-sanctioned addresses. bloXroute will leave it up to validators to choose whether to use a censoring or a non-censoring relay.  On the developer call, many of Ethereum’s core engineers spoke out loudly against the movement towards transaction censorship.  Lukasz Rozmej mentioned during the call that if Ethereum creates code that would allow for censorship, that would make Ethereum developers the “enforcers” of censorship on the protocol, a role which developers would not likely want to take on.  Dankrad Feist, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, argued on the call that Ethereum developers should be adamant about censorship resistant qualities.  No one, however, had a clear plan for what developers should do to combat censorship ahead of the Merge.  If anything was clear at the end of last week’s call, it was that this is only the beginning of a long debate.

The company hopes to release 250,000 cards, which were developed in partnership with Visa (V), by the end of the year, offering the product to the one million users it has in the South American country, the company said, adding that the digital version of the card is already available.  The card will allow payments using Brazilian reals and the 28 cryptocurrencies Ripio has listed on its platform, the company said. Serrano said Ripio is considering adding rewards in cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin (BTC).  The company also plans to launch the card in Argentina later this year, Serrano said, and is not ruling out rolling it out in other countries where the firm operates, such as Uruguay, Colombia, Mexico and Spain.  Read more: Binance Joins Argentina’s Crypto Prepaid Cards Boom  Ripio’s latest projects and plans  In Brazil, Ripio currently operates under its own brand and that of BitcoinTrade, a crypto exchange it acquired in January 2021, which had 300,000 users at the time of the acquisition. By the end of 2022, BitcoinTrade will be renamed Ripio, Serrano added.  In Brazil, Ripio recently worked on the development of Mercado Coin, a cryptocurrency launched last week by Mercado Libre (MELI), Latin America's largest e-commerce company by market cap. Ripio also provides the custody and trading service of Mercado Coin in Mercado Pago, Mercado Libre's digital wallet.  “This is the first large tokenization project and the first very large company in Latin America to integrate crypto, but we also believe that this is something that is going to become much more widespread and we want to be catalysts for the future,” Serrano said.  Ripio has also built a business-to-business team to provide white-label crypto products for other firms in the region. And in July, Ripio launched a Web3 wallet called Ripio Portal, which allows users to connect to decentralized applications and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, as well as collect non-fungible tokens (NFT).  Last September, the company raised $50 million in a Series B funding round led by blockchain investment firm Digital Currency Group (DCG). DCG owns CoinDesk as an independent subsidiary.  Serrano said Ripio has no plans to raise new capital during 2022, said Serrano, who added that the company did not have any layoffs in 2022, but did slow its hiring pace starting in November.  Ripio currently has 3.5 million users across Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Colombia, Mexico and Spain, according to Serrano. The company plans to start operations in Chile before the end of 2022, and to open offices in Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia and Paraguay next year, he added.  Serrano said Ripio is not ruling strategic acquisitions to accelerate its growth in Latin America, although he declined to give additional details.  Brazilian exchange Mercado Bitcoin leads the local market, with 3.8 million users. But this year, Latin American crypto exchange Bitso and fintech players Mercado Libre and Nubank announced they had each surpassed one million crypto users in Brazil.

The downbeat coverage comes as Marathon (MARA) remains exposed to execution risk on it ability to reach its targeted 23.3 exahash per second of mining capacity given reliance on third-party suppliers and a lack of infrastructure control, Glogola wrote in a note to clients. Specifically, Glogola lowered his 2022 revenue estimate to $150M from $204M, compared with the consensus of $186.2M.

42421825,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwAGL,1661280186,What Is NFT Wash Trading?,"The non-fungible token (NFT) market saw explosive growth in 2021, with traders investing tens of billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency into digital collectibles. Sales of digital artwork like Beeple’s Everydays - The 2020 collection also moved major money into the space and record high sales of rare Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs highlighted an increase in momentum and demand for NFT projects.  NFT transaction activity has since cooled, according to blockchain data firm Chainalysis, though the number of active NFT buyers and sellers continues to grow in 2022.  While the popularity of certain NFT projects can fluctuate depending on market conditions, some traders may try to manipulate the prices of certain NFTs to make them appear more valuable through a process called wash trading. Here’s everything you need to know.  What is NFT wash trading?  Wash trading is when the buyer and seller in a transaction are the same person or two people colluding. It's banned in conventional financial markets because it misleads the rest of the market about the true level of demand, distorts prices and entices others to trade on fake information.  This activity has been illegal in many traditional markets in the U.S. since the passage of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) of 1936.  However, the practice still occurs in unregulated crypto markets, and in particular with NFTs. According to Chainalysis, “Wash trading involving NFTs has yet to be the subject of an enforcement action.”  Historically, wash trading has been an issue for cryptocurrency exchanges attempting to inflate their trade volumes – for example, Bitwise Asset Management claimed in 2019 that up to 95% of all reported bitcoin (BTC) trading volume on exchanges is faked.  With NFTs, an individual might set up multiple crypto wallet addresses to buy and sell an NFT to themself to make it appear as though a digital asset is highly valuable.  Transactions between wallet addresses are stored on a blockchain and can be viewed publicly – meaning, anyone can see when an NFT was traded and how much that NFT sold for. However, wallet addresses contain no identifying information and are presented as a string of alphanumeric characters, making it very difficult to discern who is behind a transaction and if two wallet addresses are owned by the same individual.  Examples of NFT wash trades  While wash trades are often hard to detect, there have been notable examples of inflated NFT trades that were used to manipulate market prices. On Oct. 28, 2021, CryptoPunk 9998 was traded between two wallets for 124,457 ether (ETH), worth around $532 million at the time. The sale of the white-haired, green-eyed, pixelated character was picked up by CryptoPunks Bot, which automatically tracks and announces CryptoPunks transactions on Twitter.  According to Etherscan, the buyer used a flash loan from multiple sources to pay 124,457 ETH to the CryptoPunk’s smart contract, which was then transferred to the seller’s wallet. The seller then sent the 124,457 ETH back to the buyer, who repaid the loans – a sign of a suspicious transaction.  Ultimately, the CryptoPunks team tweeted that the transaction was null, and that “in a nutshell, someone bought this punk from themself with borrowed money and repaid the loan in the same transaction.”  At the end of the wash trade, the NFT was listed back on the market for 250,000 ETH, or about $1 billion. To put things in perspective, this particular CryptoPunk was selling for between $300,000 and $400,000 before the wash trading incident.  Some NFT marketplaces have also been accused of fostering an environment for wash trading. For example, data compiled by NFT tracker CryptoSlam suggests that $18 billion of the trading volume on LooksRare, or about 95% of the total activity, has been linked to wash trading.  How to spot an NFT wash trade  In February 2022, Chainalysis published a report on NFT wash trading by analyzing sales of NFTs to addresses that were self-financed, or “funded either by the selling address or by the address that initially funded the selling address.” It concluded that “some NFT sellers have conducted hundreds of wash trades.”  In particular, it was able to identify 262 users who had sold an NFT to a self-financed wallet more than 25 times. Although Chainalysis admitted that it could not be 100% sure that all of the users were NFT wash traders, 110 of those wallets collectively generated $8.9 million in profit in 2021.  “[The] $8.9 million is most likely derived from sales to unsuspecting buyers who believe the NFT they’re purchasing has been growing in value, sold from one distinct collector to another,” the report said.  Still, it noted that most NFT wash traders it identified have not been profitable – meaning, their profit did not make up for the gas fees they spent on each Ethereum blockchain transaction.  It's worth noting that the profit made from wash trading is likely higher since the report only considered transactions made in ether and wrapped ether (wETH).  If you're interested in buying an NFT, here are some possible signs of wash trading to look out for:  Price: If the NFT you’re looking to buy is priced significantly higher than the collection’s floor price (the lowest price an NFT is selling for in a particular collection), then it is possible the NFT has been wash-traded, especially if that NFT has little to no rare attributes that might explain a higher price point.  Transaction history: Tools like Etherscan and BscScan can be used to check the transaction history of an NFT. Some marketplaces, like OpenSea, also display this information on their listing pages. A sudden jump in the price of an NFT without any prior activity could be a sign of wash trading.  Previous owners: Look out for wallet addresses that show up multiple times in the transaction history, as in the case of CryptoPunk 9998. If the same wallet has purchased an NFT multiple times, then it could be a sign of wash trading. You can also look at individual wallet addresses to see if they’ve interacted with other wallet addresses listed in an NFTs transaction history – another potential sign that the wallets may be closely linked to one another.  Staying safe  Wash trading is an illegal practice in most traditional markets in the U.S., although it remains difficult to enforce in the crypto space because of the pseudonymous nature of blockchain interactions.  NFT traders will engage in this activity to create a false impression of high demand and inflate the value of an NFT collection.  Typically, there are signs to look out for when an NFT has been wash traded, such as a major difference between the floor price and list price of an NFT in a collection. Ultimately, researching an NFT collection and looking at the transaction history is important to understanding if an NFT's price has been manipulated.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Andrey Sergeenkov,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-nft-wash-trading,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/61793b456aa359d1c1cc5e7e72fdd0ff77efa7c5-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42373997,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWhBf,1661272718,Exchange Giant CME’s Bitcoin Futures Just Hit a Huge Discount to Spot Prices,"Bitcoin (BTC) futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, one of the world’s biggest derivatives markets, just traded at the largest discount to spot prices in at least 2 1/2 years after a big market plunge and right before August contracts expire.  Arcane Research keeps tabs on the average difference between CME’s front-month bitcoin futures – those expiring soonest – and the current market price for bitcoin itself for rolling one-month periods. On Monday, that showed front-month futures at a 3.36% discount. That’s a record low in the firm’s dataset that goes back to Jan. 1, 2020 – though CME bitcoin futures have been trading since December 2017.  That surpassed the previous low of minus 2.39% set on July 21, 2021, which was followed by a hefty short squeeze, according to Arcane.  CME futures have traded at a discount over the last two months but witnessed a short-lived recovery at the start of the month when there was some momentum in the market. Early in August, bitcoin briefly reached $25,000. But it sank below $21,000 on Aug. 19.  “The growing discounts in the front-month contracts might be explained in part by structural effects,” Vetle Lunde, an analyst at Arcane Research, said in a report.  The report said the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) has begun rolling its August contracts into contracts that expire later, possibly causing downward pressure on the front-month contracts. Monday, BITO rolled over 1,000 August contracts and will roll over a further 3,000 August contracts by Friday. Previous times when the exchange-traded fund rolled over exposures, front-month contracts have tended to move toward discounts to spot, according to Arcane.  “Still, such extreme discounts have not appeared during previous rolling periods,” Lunde said. “They might be a symptom of worsening liquidity or general de-risking as S&P 500 and Nasdaq see a tumultuous start to the week while the dollar strength index pushes towards new highs.”  Read more: CME Group Adds to Crypto Offerings With Ether Options",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/08/23/exchange-giant-cmes-bitcoin-futures-just-hit-a-huge-discount-to-spot-prices,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/feb89c503c4f8096591119dbfa5a26f1d11273f1-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374000,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWhGh,1661270455,Solana-based Projects Team Up to Make Cross-Chain Messaging Standard,"A group of Solana blockchain-based protocols are pushing to streamline crypto communications through open-sourced standards that proponents hope will break down the data silos between projects and chains.  The so-called “Open Chat Alliance” debuted Tuesday with buy-in from 19 Solana projects, most notably messaging platform Notifi Network, Solana Name Service (SNS) provider Bonfida and non-fungible token (NFT)-powered social media platform Only1. Their plan is to create a transparent and interoperable standard for handling crypto-based messages that can proliferate across the industry.  The alliance seeks to address what Notifi CEO Paul Kim calls crypto’s “wallet gardens” problem. He told CoinDesk that when users join a protocol or project’s community, they can’t freely communicate with others. Being bound to one platform with one identity creates siloed communication, he said.  This “[goes] against the entire concept of Web3” being open source, accessible and interoperable, said Kim.  It's not the first time crypto projects have tried to break down these walls. Data service Chainlink has its own cross-chain system; the entire Cosmos ecosystem is built around the idea of “inter-blockchain communications.”  The alliance says it will form a communications standard that projects on different chains can utilize despite the tech differences between blockchains. In theory, an interoperable standard would make it easy for a Solana user to send a message to someone on Ethereum, for example.  Even in Solana there's hardly unity around messaging systems. Dialect, a competitor with its own messaging standards, has publicly with many protocols in the space, underscoring the uphill battle that any single self-described ""standard"" faces in achieving mass adoption.  Leon Lee, founder and CEO of Only1, told CoinDesk that an example of the alliance’s framework includes GameFi and NFT dapp users freely communicating with each other, without the boundaries of separate protocols, wallets or chains.  “You're using your wallet as your kind of passport. And that passport has data on what you have and don't have in your assets,” said Kim, the Notifi CEO.  However, the technology surrounding cross-chain messaging hasn’t been safe from hackers.  The $600 million Poly Network hack last August sparked concerns around protocol interoperability because a message sent between chains triggered the attack. These “bridges” are often targeted, as seen in April’s $625 million Ronin hack and the $200 million Nomad exploit earlier this month.  According to Kim, this is why Open Chat Alliance’s framework is solely for messaging.  “There's multiple different features as a user you can subscribe to and, depending on which feature you use, different security protocols,” said Kim. “But at the end of the day, we're not really interacting just yet with any of the transactions beyond just communication.”  The three projects behind the alliance have already partnered with 19 projects in the Solana ecosystem, thus far, primarily NFT and DeFi-related projects. More projects are in the pipeline, according to Kim.  Realy, a Solana-based metaverse, is enthusiastic about incorporating the framework for Web3 users to communicate outside of their network.  George Yang, CEO of Realy, told CoinDesk that an interoperable messaging framework will afford greater communication between projects, because “Web3 is an open and connected network.”  In addition, social data platform CyberConnect hopes to incorporate the messaging framework.  “CyberConnect users will not only be able to view their friend’s profile but also to send a message,” said Shiyu Zhang, CEO of CyberConnect.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | LINK | SOL | TECHNOLOGY,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/08/23/solana-based-projects-team-up-to-make-cross-chain-messaging-standard,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7e7c9a135632e064325cda112c26d4ba8eb9e538-4608x3456.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The main question is whether the Iranian government has provided fixed rules for the use of cryptocurrencies that will not change for several months, and in the meantime, businesses active in this digital field will not be harmed.&apos; The association representative stated, &apos;It is absolutely necessary to educate and train people to use this new technology in Iran as well as have stable regulations in this regard.&apos; Widespread Use of Cryptocurrencies and Smart Contracts The first official import order using cryptocurrencies was successfully placed, according to Alireza Peymanpak, vice minister of Ira...",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/iran-must-have-stable-crypto-regulation-says-import-association/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=iran-must-have-stable-crypto-regulation-says-import-association,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

According to CoinMarketCap, EGLD is up by 0.77% or trading at $53.58 as of this writing. It can be remembered that EGLD had a stirring bull run last month that has propelled the coin to a spike of 16%. However, since then, the coin has had a massive double-digit decline this August. EGLD apparently treads the same direction with major crypto Bitcoin that has experienced the extreme downswing that affected the crypto market this month.

42411404,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNYPs,1661268600,Crypto Banks Are One Step Closer to Reality Under New Fed Guidance,"The U.S. Federal Reserve published guidance detailing how crypto banks can secure master account access, something several of these banks have wanted for over a year. While the guidance stops short of true transparency, potential applicants now have a roadmap of sorts they can follow, while the Fed has indicated that it is indeed open to letting crypto companies (and other novel entities) access global payments rails.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Big baby step  The narrative  After over a year, the Federal Reserve published final guidance detailing how it will assess reserve account applications from banks, ranging from federally supervised entities with deposit insurance to novel financial institutions with state charters. That’s right, folks, we’re talking about Wyoming’s Special Purpose Depository Institutions (SPDI).  Why it matters  A handful of crypto companies have sought bank charters for the past few years. The reasons for doing so vary. In some cases, a federal bank or trust charter opens up the potential client list for various services. For others, being a bank means no longer needing a bank intermediary to access the global financial system. Regardless of the reasons, last week’s release provided a shot of adrenaline to these efforts, although it is just a first step.  Breaking it down  The Fed said last Monday that it was publishing its finalized guidance for novel financial institutions and other banks seeking access to its “master accounts” (otherwise known as Reserve accounts and not at all to be confused with FedAccounts). Under the published guidance, the Fed will look at how applicants meet six criteria and judge them based on what sort of institution they are.  Each applicant will have to 1) be legally allowed to apply for a Reserve Bank account, 2) verify they would not create a risk to the Federal Reserve Bank that grants them an account, 3) verify they will not create a risk to the overall payment system 4) verify they will not create a risk to the U.S. financial system 5) prove they won’t allow illicit activity and 6) show they won’t “adversely affect” the Fed’s ability to draft and apply monetary policy.  The amount of scrutiny a Fed Reserve Bank branch will apply to an applicant depends on what kind of applicant it is. Tier 1 institutions include federally insured banks and will face the lightest amount of scrutiny. Tier 2 institutions are not federally insured but are at least overseen by a federal bank regulator. Tier 3 institutions are not federally insured or overseen by a federal regulator and will face the toughest scrutiny.  Crypto companies, like Wyoming SPDIs or New York trust entities, will mostly fall into Tier 3 (though some, like Paxos, could be classified as Tier 2).  What the Fed did not do is describe just what this scrutiny will actually look like, or how long it may take to evaluate an application.  Julie Hill, a professor at the University of Alabama’s School of Law, noted that the final guidance is “more or less the same” as the proposed guidance first published in April 2021. The Fed solicited public feedback at the time, ultimately receiving more than 40 unique comments and over 280 form letters.  According to the Fed, many of the comments provided specific feedback to the different tenets laid out in the proposed guidance.  Other commenters pushed back against the idea that some companies without federal charters or companies with novel charters could gain access. Despite this, the Fed explicitly denied these commenters’ feedback.  “Some of the commenters to the guidelines said crypto companies or [companies] without deposit insurance should not be eligible and the guidelines don’t say that,” Hill said.  Gary De Waal, special counsel with the Katten Muchin Rosenman law firm, agreed.  “There was a lot of pushback in the comments. This is a classic case of the traditional versus the nontraditional, and I think the Fed has stood up well to the traditional and they said, ‘We’re not going to just say no,’” he said. “You can see that in the responses to the comments. To me that’s very significant, people should not underestimate that.”  In a document published by the Fed detailing the comment letter, the central bank explicitly said the guidance was meant for any eligible company to use.  “The Board does not believe that it is appropriate to categorically exclude all novel charters from access to accounts and services. The Account Access Guidelines as adopted are intended to be applied by Reserve Banks to access requests from eligible institutions with both novel and more traditional charters. The Board believes that the final Account Access Guidelines will provide a robust framework for analyzing and mitigating risk,” the Fed’s guidance said.  This is good news for the crypto applicants, De Waal said. De Waal, alongside two of his Katten colleagues (former CFTC General Counsel Daniel Davis and special counsel Christina Grigorian), wrote an article for the National Law Review analyzing the guidance.  OK, but what’s the bad news?  There is more the Fed needs to explain.  While the Fed detailed its six principles, it did not explain how a company can satisfy those principles. It also has not shared what its timeline for approvals might look like.  In other words, while we know that Tier 3 applicants will face the greatest amount of scrutiny, we have no idea what that means.  A Federal Reserve spokesperson declined to comment about this on the record.  The Fed has a long list of risk factors, but it hasn’t shared what they are, Hill said.  The central bank may publish additional guidance that can answer these questions.  “I think this is clearly a first step, but it’s an important first step,” De Waal said. “... My hunch is the further guidelines that are published by the Reserve Bank will seem more ‘meat on the bones.’”  In the meantime, companies that have already applied for reserve account access may have to continue waiting. Of the two companies that have applied (that we know of), one has already lost patience. Custodia Bank filed suit against the Fed earlier this year, alleging it violated a statutory deadline to make a decision on its application.  The Fed responded last week, after the guidance was published.  The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which were each named as a defendant, filed their own motions to dismiss with supporting documents.  The Board’s defense boils down to stating it is under no legal obligation to direct the Kansas branch of the Fed to approve a master account, as De Waal pointed out.  “The Board, a federal agency … would not be an appropriate defendant even if plaintiff had any cognizable claims (and it does not),” the filing said.  The Kansas bank’s defense further says that it does not believe it has “taken an unreasonable amount of time to consider Custodia’s request,” given the circumstances (namely: That Custodia is a non-FDIC-insured state-chartered SPDI that would be the first crypto company to secure master account access if approved).  It also says it is under no obligation to grant Custodia a master account, and it lays out the various concerns and risks that a crypto bank might pose.  Plus, it’s still crypto.  It’s this last argument that I suspect we’ll see more often. Concerns about the financial stability risks of cryptocurrencies – particularly stablecoins – are appearing more and more. The Fed (national group, not a reserve bank) even included this in the minutes of its latest Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) meeting.  “[The Fed staff] noted that these assets, including stablecoins, were subject to vulnerabilities – such as runs, fire sales, and excessive leverage – similar to those associated with more traditional assets,” the minutes said.  “While the recent turmoil in digital asset markets had not spread to other asset classes, these participants saw digital assets’ rising importance and growing interconnectedness with other segments of the financial system as underscoring the need to establish a robust supervisory and regulatory framework for this industry that would appropriately limit potential systemic risks. A few participants mentioned the need to strengthen the oversight and regulation of certain types of nonbank financial institutions.”  These concerns are probably not going away, so what remains to be seen is how the Fed branch banks address them as they evaluate the crypto banks’ applications.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  Elections are coming up. I wonder what those will mean for this list here.  Elsewhere:  Ukraine Bought Weapons, Drones With Crypto Donations: Ukraine’s government bought weapons, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, better known as drones) and digital rifle scopes, besides non-lethal tools, with some of the $60 million in crypto donated after Russia invaded the European nation earlier this year, Ukraine’s minister for Digital Transformation, Ukraine’s minister for Digital Transformation, revealed Wednesday in a new breakdown of expenditures.  FDIC Orders Crypto Exchange FTX US, 4 Others to Cease 'Misleading' Claims: The U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.

Crypto Lender Hodlnaut Faces Singapore Police ‘Actions’ and Staggering Job Cuts: Hodlnaut, a Singapore-based crypto lender, disclosed early Friday that it had fired about 80% of its staff (40 people) and may be subject to future police proceedings. It has filed for creditor protection; a Singapore court will hear the application on Monday and determine whether an interim manager should be appointed to take charge of the company.  As SEC Leans on Enforcement to Regulate, Crypto Lawyers Study Every Word: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission caused some consternation last month when it brought insider trading charges against a former Coinbase (COIN) employee, alleging that nine cryptocurrencies listed on the exchange were securities in the process. Jesse Hamilton breaks down what attorneys following the crypto sector took away from the filing.  Tornado Cash Developer's Arrest in the Netherlands Draws Community Protest: More than 50 people gathered in Amsterdam to protest the arrest of blockchain developer Alexey Pertsev, who was arrested earlier this month on allegations of being involved in building the now-U.S.-sanctioned Tornado Cash, though he has yet to be formally charged with anything. At the moment, it appears that Pertsev was arrested merely for developing a protocol that has been used for both legal and illicit activity. This is sure to concern blockchain developers, privacy activists and, well, most people.  Voyager Customers Say No to 'Retention' Bonuses for Employees of Bankrupt Crypto Lender: Creditors of crypto lender Voyager Digital have filed an opposition to the company's bid to pay 38 employees a collective $1.9 million as a ""retention"" bonus, arguing the company has done little to reduce headcount or costs. The bonuses are meant to go to ""non-insiders,"" meaning non-executive employees, though the U.S. Trustee's Office said in its own filing that some of these employees may in fact be executives or otherwise ineligible for the bonus.  Outside CoinDesk:  (Wall Street Journal) SEC Chair Gary Gensler wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal saying that crypto markets are identical to capital markets – at least, where his agency is concerned. He pointed to BlockFi and the SEC's recent settlement with the crypto lending platform as an example, saying BlockFi's business model could replace crypto with any other asset and still be the same, legally speaking.  (Politico) U.S. President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law last week. It’s a sweeping bill, and I couldn’t find many articles that provided a broad summary of the different provisions, but it does seem significant so here’s a primer from Politico.  (CNN) There are ongoing, simultaneous heatwaves and droughts across much of the U.S., Europe and China, which seems, I dunno, terrifying? This isn’t directly a crypto-related story but we do all live on this planet and this is clearly an important issue we should be paying attention to. More from the WSJ on the issues here.  (Grid News) Former CoinDesk writer Ben Powers has an interesting look at whether crypto and Web3 really are better for extremists than the, I guess “traditional,” web. The short answer seems to be “not really,” at least right now.  (Crypto Briefing) The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit against Dragonchain last week, alleging it violated securities laws in a 2017 initial coin offering (ICO). Crypto Briefing’s Mitchell Moos published a massive exploration into the company, its leadership and the ICO in question. Among Moos’ findings: Multiple employees alleged that the founders threatened them legally and/or physically during their employment.

Marathon delivered disappointing results in the second quarter as several thousand of its mining rigs were sitting idly due to storms and energization delays. However, the firm has announced hosting deals that would help it reach its hashrate, or computing power, goal of 23.3 exahash per second (EH/s) by mid-2023.  However, these deals come with execution risk due to Marathon's reliance on third-party suppliers and a lack of infrastructure control, said Cowen analysts Stephen Glagola and George Kuhle in a note to clients. They take note that one of those third parties is Applied Blockchain (APLD), a ""relative newcomer to the bitcoin mining hosting business with limited operating history.""  Reflecting those disappointing quarterly results, the Cowen team lowered its 2022 revenue estimate for Marathon to $150 million from $204 million, now below the consensus forecast for $189 million. Cowen also dropped its expectations for adjusted EBITDA to $39 million from $86 million, and mining profit to $91 million with 61% margin, down from $132 million and a 64.7% margin.  Cowen continues to rate Marathon at Market Perform, but lifted its price target to $9 from $7 following a near-tripling in the stock price over the last seven weeks to the current $14 per share.

1641909,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=245483,1661267518,$73M Stolen Money Laundered by Ronin Bridge Hackers Using ChipMixer,"Using the privacy protocol ChipMixer, Ronin bridge hackers laundered 3,460 BTC ($73.2 million), according to on-chain research by SlowMists. The blockchain security company SlowMist conducted an on-chain investigation of the Ronin breach and reported that the mixing protocol ChipMixer was used as a hacker hotspot on the Bitcoin network. The investigation claims that on March 29, hackers stole assets worth $610 million from Axie Infinity&apos;s Ronin bridge. The majority of the money was laundered on the Ethereum and Bitcoin networks. The money used to launder money on the Ethereum blockchain was transferred to Tornado Cash at a rate of 74.7% (300,160 ETH), while the hacker&apos;s account still has 95,570 ETH. To the Bitcoin network, several 6,531.04 BTC were sent. 36.6% of the cash was still kept in the account of the hacker, while 3,460 BTC (49.1% of the total) were laundered, thanks to ChipMixer. The hackers took 2,671 BTC out of the ChipMixer protocol and moved the money through Blender, Wasabi Coinjoin, and the Binance exchange.

42411394,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNXpV,1661267126,Will Global Regulations Stifle the Crypto Industry or Encourage New Users?,"With the Australian government announcing a new cryptocurrency regulatory regime on Monday, and news in April that the U.K. government will introduce new regulations for stablecoins, steps are being taken around the globe to monitor and control the fast-moving digital asset industry, under the guise of consumer protection.  Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers said in a statement that the “Treasury will prioritize ‘token mapping’ work in 2022, which will help identify how crypto assets and related services should be regulated.” (Mapping is a strategy that would account for a cryptocurrency’s underlying code and actual use when classifying an asset – theoretically allowing Australia to take a more flexible approach to digital asset oversight.)  Zac Colbert is a financial writer. This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.     Back in April, The U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, stated, “We want to see the businesses of tomorrow – and the jobs they create – here in the U.K., and by regulating effectively we can give them the confidence they need to think and invest long-term.”  Worldwide, regulators are in the tough position of writing rules that can account for all the varied ways open source cryptocurrencies can be used without stifling innovation.  The U.K. Treasury, for instance, plans to pass legislation to clarify stablecoin regulation for payments, giving the government increased power to oversee authorities such as the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), in bringing stablecoins under a regulatory framework that will allow the U.K. to become a “crypto hub.”  And in June of this year, the European Union introduced its much awaited Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) bill. This new legislation is geared towards regulating both digital assets and stablecoins, and would require digital asset firms to disclose all crypto transactions that take place on their platforms.  This came hot on the heels of U.S. news in April about the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stating that the top crypto asset exchanges should be made to register with the SEC and comply with all relevant financial trading laws.  Officials across the globe insist these steps are aimed at protecting consumers and keeping the various governmental bodies at the forefront of the ever-changing digital asset terrain. However, blockchain enthusiasts and professionals alike feel new rules such as these could undermine the innovation that’s made blockchain technology so successful, and in fact threaten the very safety of the consumers they claim to protect.  See also: US States Will Continue to Lead in Regulating Digital Assets | Opinion  The EU’s MiCA bill in particular drew criticism from 46 leading crypto firms that stated some elements of the legislation actually put digital asset owners at risk, specifically their privacy and the security of their personal data. In addition, the 46 signatories of the letter penned to the EU finance ministers, argued that the laws would place the European Union at odds with other countries, making it a far less competitive location for crypto startups and therefore dissuading top tech talent from operating in EU countries.  Ironically, it was distrust of governments’ traditional role as issuers of fiat money that inspired the creation of Bitcoin and fueled the recent meteoric growth of digital asset markets worldwide. And this incredible increase in adopters of cryptocurrency, non-fungible tokens (NFT) and other digital assets, would signify that users appear comfortable with the risk involved in the volatile market.  Unfortunately, it still feels much more a case of “when” rather than “if” these restrictive rules and legislations will come into place.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION, Zac Colbert,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/08/23/will-global-regulations-stifle-the-crypto-industry-or-encourage-new-users,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/20cadb537152ea4fd1fcc51fea9203fb62541d63-1820x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

OFAC, the Treasury Department's sanctions watchdog, added Tornado Cash to its list of specially designated nationals on allegations it helped North Korea's Lazarus hacking group launder millions of dollars' worth of crypto proceeds stolen from various crypto projects over the past two or three years.  In his letter Tuesday, Emmer said these sanctions looked like a ""divergence from previous OFAC precedent"" as some of the addresses added were tied to smart contracts and open-source software, rather than any specific person or entity.  ""OFAC's sanctions on the virtual currency anonymizing software Tornado Cash in accordance with [an Executive Order] are the first sanctions issued against something other than an individual or entity determined 'to be responsible for or complicit in' malicious cyber-enabled activities that pose a threat on United States national security, foreign policy, economic health or financial stability,"" he wrote in the letter.  Read more: US Treasury's Tornado Cash Sanctions Are ‘Unprecedented,’ Warns Congressman  Another Treasury unit, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), has already drawn a distinction between service providers and software providers, saying only service providers – the operators of a mixer, in this example – are subject to Bank Secrecy Act rules. Tornado Cash should be seen as an anonymizing mixer.  Emmer directed several questions at OFAC, including which entity OFAC believed should have imposed controls on Tornado Cash blockchain contracts, how U.S. users can reclaim funds currently locked in the mixer, what people who receive funds should do, whether funds locked on Tornado Cash ""through some mechanism or legal fiction"" belong to an entity on the SDN list or to the person who put the funds in the mixer and a handful of others.  Perhaps most pertinent to much of the crypto sector, Emmer asked how Tornado Cash addresses could appeal their designation, given they are not people or entities.  Read more: Issues Crypto Should Watch For in the Tornado Cash Sanctions  His letter echoes comments made by the broader crypto industry, which saw the sanctions as a major concern. Coin Center, a crypto think tank, has threatened to bring a legal action against the Treasury Department, questioning whether a running, autonomous smart contract can even be added to the sanctions list.  The Electronic Frontier Foundation has likewise taken up the cause, representing a John Hopkins Professor Matthew Green and his right to publish a fork of Tornado Cash's source code.

Scaramucci Explains,"Many investors picked interest in Bitcoin, believing it could be a hedge against inflation. According to an analyst at D.A Davidson, Chris Brendler, BTC could become a hedge because it is decentralized and not a product of a central bank. These opinions and expectations led many people to accumulate large quantities of BTC coins. But the recent price fluctuations and speculations in the market are seemingly overpowering BTC&apos;s underlying value. Now that inflation is causing havoc in economies, many investors are disappointed that Bitcoin couldn&apos;t serve as a hedge as expected.

The financial organization claims digital assets began an accelerated integration with the region during the pandemic as more people traded them looking to generate yield. From 2020 to its all-time high in 2021, the crypto total market cap increased by over 20-fold which led Bitcoin and Ethereum into price discovery. As seen in the chart below, the total trading volume for cryptocurrencies rose very close to $900 billion from below $100 billion at its peaked in 2021. The regions with the highest trading volume are the Americas and Europe. The Middle East and Central Asia, EM Asia, and AE Asia are below other regions. However, the IMF claims adoption of cryptocurrencies in Asia could pose a systematic risk for the financial world. If the price of Bitcoin and the crypto market reclaim their previous levels, and re-entered price discovery, the financial institution believes that there could be negative consequences. If digital assets were to rise and crash as they did over the past year, &apos;contagion could spread through individual or institutional investors&apos;.

42373993,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWh6d,1661263200,"Blockchain Company Mural, Founded by Palantir Alums, Raises $5.6M","Blockchain startup Mural, founded by alumni of publicly traded data analytics software company Palantir Technologies (PLTR), has raised $5.6 million in seed funding at an undisclosed valuation to help global brands manage the treasuries behind their decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO).  “We’re now seeing a new wave of DAOs being spun up by many of the world’s leading brands,” Mural Chief Product Officer Kevin Alvarez Fung told CoinDesk in an interview. “They see the value of DAOs just like they saw the value of e-commerce in the early 2000s, as a mechanism to better digitally engage their customers.”  Fung previously worked in product management at SoftBank-backed financial technology company Digits, but New York-based Mural has strong ties to Palantir, which was founded by billionaire Peter Thiel. Mural CEO Sinclair Toffa and co-founder and chief technology officer Arthur Kam both worked at Palantir as technical leads and engineers. Mural also named Robert Fink, former chief architect of Palantir’s flagship Foundry product, as one of the founding advisors.  Treasury management  Mural launched on Tuesday with the funding news and an initial group of brand partners that included Superf3st, a community-powered music festival from the creator of popular festivals Outside Lands and Bonnaroo.  Mural is creating financial infrastructure related to decentralized autonomous organizations, blockchain-backed communities that band together around a shared interest. DAO users purchase some type of token, often non-fungible tokens (NFT), in brand communities to participate and vote. Proceeds go into a community treasury that’s used for operations and investments in desired projects.  Read more: What Is a DAO?  DAO treasury management is difficult for even smaller, niche communities. And brands forming a DAO have to deal with security, transparency and regulatory compliance issues for sizable treasuries that could manage tens to hundreds of millions of dollars, said Fung. Mural is building a treasury management platform that helps brands manage treasury currency flows and specific needs such as milestone-triggered payments.  Backers for the funding round included investment firm Galaxy Ventures, CoinDesk parent Digital Currency Group, venture firm Firstminute, and Palumni, the Palantir alumni venture capital fund, among others.  The new capital will go toward hiring talent, building out the product and forming new brand partnerships, said Toffa.  Mural isn't the first time Palantir alums have raised funding for a Web3 firm. Blockchain analytics company Elementus President Greg Barbaccia and Chief Strategy Officer Chitra Ragavan both worked at Palantir, and the company raised $12 million last October shortly after being named to Palantir’s Foundry for Builders program.

Also, bitcoin’s 200-week moving average multiple, a critical level of support used to determine an overall long-term market trend, is suddenly trending down.  Market Moves: Ethereum Merge drama continues as traders pile out, then back in. CoinDesk's Jimmy He looks at what traders are doing.  Chart of the Day: Data shows the Merge is increasingly being mentioned on social media.  This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price point  Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) gained ground slightly Tuesday as markets continued to stabilize following last week’s bloodbath. U.S. stock futures posted modest gains and bond prices edged up.  Over the last seven days, BTC is still down 10% and ETH by 12%. This has pushed the overall market capitalization to below the $1 trillion mark.  The one-day Heiken Aishi (average bar) candles called a reversal this week as the open/close spread is very tight.  Some analysts are expecting the upcoming Merge, a major milestone for the second-largest blockchain, Ethereum, to have a positive impact on the crypto market as a whole, while others are saying it will have little effect on price.  “A short-term rally towards $1.2 trillion is plausible, but I would expect the market to keep being range-bounded going into the Merge,” wrote David Scheuermann, analyst at Crypto Finance AG, in a market note.  Another indicator, bitcoin’s 200-week (200W) moving average multiple, a critical level of support used to determine an overall long-term market trend, is suddenly trending down.  The 200W moving average is a critical level of support used to determine an overall long-term market trend. The trendline measures the average price of BTC over the prior 200 weeks.  According to data from Kraken, BTC is trading at 0.9 times its 200-week moving average, which is down 0.3% week over week, now at $23,118.  At the current 200-week moving average, a 10 times to 15 times multiple (historical range) implies a price range of $231,188 to $346,782, according to a report from Kraken Insights.  In March 2021, the multiple hit a local high of 5.8x before entering into a downtrend.  In the news, crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) faces a class action lawsuit over alleged lapses in security.

Market Moves  Ethereum Merge Drama Continues as Traders Pile Out, Then Back In  By Jimmy He  For the past month, crypto markets have been buffeted by speculation over the potential impact of Ethereum's coming Merge – a major milestone for the second-largest blockchain. A key question is how the shift to a proof-of-stake system, which is supposed to be faster and more energy-efficient than the current proof-of-work protocol, will affect prices for ether (ETH) and related digital assets.  And with the event now approaching, expected next month, the market narrative keeps twisting.  According to a weekly report from the data provider Kaiko, ether’s steep price plunge on Friday brought a swift decline in open interest on derivatives – contracts that traders used to make leveraged bets on the cryptocurrency’s future price. Many traders had their derivatives trades liquidated, or wiped out due to margin calls, according to Kaiko.  But on Monday, money flooded back into the ETH futures market, the data provider found.  “As the price dipped below $1,600, we observed a significant spike in open interest,” Kaiko wrote.  Ether perpetual funding rates  There’s also been plenty of movement in funding rates on ether perpetual contracts, which are similar to futures contracts on commodities but without expiration dates. The funding rates recovered to near-neutral levels after dipping alongside the token’s price.  “When combined with the spike in open interest we observed this morning, it seems these new positions in ETH futures are biased long and investors are bullish at these price levels,” Kaiko wrote.  Trading volumes flipped  Separately, ether’s share of the weekly, combined trading volume of ether and bitcoin hit 57%, the highest since 2018. This trading activity exceeded Ethereum’s previous peak of 55% during the May 2021 crypto sell-off.  “The main driver of ETH trading activity in July has been increased optimism around the Merge and an improvement of global risk sentiment. However, last week’s selloff across markets confirms that ETH remains a higher beta play,” Kaiko wrote.  Read the full story here.  Chart of the Day  ETH Merge Discussions Heat Up  By Omkar Godbole  Data tracked by analytics firm Santiment shows Ethereum's impending technological upgrade, dubbed ""The Merge,"" is increasingly being mentioned on social media.  Large spikes in social media mentions indicates retail investor euphoria, often observed at local price tops. Ether has come under pressure with social media seeing record interest in the topic.  Interest is likely to remain high as we near the supposedly bullish Merge, slated to happen in mid-September.  ""As we draw closer, it's very likely we see yet another spike in 'Merge' social dominance and similar price action (alts dropping, ETH rising) as late comers pile in whatever they have to ride it, which eventually increase the chance of things leading to a blow off top,"" Santiment said in the blog post published last week.

42411396,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNY2j,1661261269,"The More Energy Bitcoin Uses, the Better","Much has been written about how Bitcoin’s energy use is less carbon-intensive than its critics assume. Due to its high utilization of renewable and zero-carbon energy, this is true.  Much has been written about how Bitcoin’s energy use is justified by the economic outcomes it promotes. As Bitcoin provides people around the globe with an incorruptible tool for storing value, this is true.  Steven Lubka, a CoinDesk columnist, leads Swan Private, Swan Bitcoin's concierge service for high-net worth investors.  Much has been written about how Bitcoin’s energy use is tiny in the context of global energy consumption. Bitcoin uses less energy than electric clothes drying machines, so this too is true.  However, very little has been written about how Bitcoin’s energy use is actually good. In fact, energy use itself is good because humans benefit from using energy, and the more they use, the better.  I recognize that this is a controversial stance in today’s world of climate concerns. I sympathize with and share the view that maintaining a habitable planet is an important goal. However, the path to environmental security and the path to economic security is the same path: increased mastery over energy.  See also: Can Crypto Miners Make the World Greener?  The reality of how humans innovate and accomplish important things is intimately tied to our control over energy. So do geopolitics and the matters of war and peace. Even our ability to mitigate the environmental impact is a function of how much control we have over energy.  The bottom line is this: Energy is the master resource of human civilization and we should always be aspiring to become better masters of energy.  Whether you support huge deployments of solar and wind energy, nuclear or even think we should actually use more fossil fuels, you should support humans using more energy in aggregate.  Why? The simple truth is that for us to get better at deploying, maintaining and improving your preferred method of energy production, we need to actually build more of that energy production!  Economic thinking  Human knowledge does not only emerge in the vacuum of academia. Industrial knowledge emerges only when we actually build and operate things.  César Hidalgo, one of the foremost thinkers in the field of ""economic complexity,"" finds that such knowledge only comes from direct experiential learning, not from universities and books. From praxis, not from theory.  In other words, the idea of a nuclear power plant built and run entirely by Ph.D.s who have never operated a power plant a day in their lives is a frightening notion.  This quickly leads one to the realization that accumulating productive knowledge requires those industries to, in the first place, exist, and in the second, to provide opportunities to advance our knowledge via continued operation.  We need productive knowledge to operate industries, and industries can only be operated if we have productive knowledge. It is an intimate dance of increments.  Inevitably, Hidalgo found that countries move from the products they already produce to new products which rely on similar productive knowledge.  Thus, in order to improve our ability to generate energy, we must first generate energy. The more energy we generate, and even one could argue the more diversity of energy we generate, the more opportunities we have to improve our productive knowledge.  Regardless of what form you think humanity's future energy consumption should come in, it is critical to admit that we will only become efficient proprietors of that form of energy by building and operating more of it. This then means that more capital should be devoted to these endeavors. Bitcoin (BTC) mining makes this possible through organic market incentives.  Free markets  Some people see the allocation of capital for an energy transition as being the responsibility of government. However, if history has taught us anything it is that free markets are a modern miracle and are better at capital allocation than any central entity humanity has ever known. I do not intend to argue whether or not governments should have a role, or how much of a role in this process they should have.  No matter what views you hold on the role of government in our energy future, it is impossible to deny that real market incentives provide a massive advantage to the development of better, cheaper and more efficient energy technologies.  Additional capital that incentivizes more energy production is a virtuous cycle whose end result is more prosperity and greater knowledge regarding energy production. This inevitably also includes our ability to control how much carbon is emitted while producing energy.  See also: Revisiting Bitcoin’s Energy ‘Problem’ in the Face of ESG Investment Mandates  Bitcoin is an ingenious force for allocating capital to the most efficient energy producers. Any miner who can secure cheaper energy can make a greater profit mining bitcoin than their competitors.  When new bitcoin miners come online using cheaper energy than existing miners, they actually make it more difficult for those other less efficient miners to continue to mine using their antiquated energy resources. The end result is a virtuous cycle chasing ever cheaper energy and making inefficient energy sources non-financially viable on the Bitcoin network.  Let this sink in for a moment: Bitcoin mining will provide the most efficient energy production facilities with added cash flow and will withdraw its cash flow from less efficient ones. This will accelerate the construction of efficient energy production sources and potentially also accelerate the cessation of inefficient sources.  Do you believe that renewables are the cheapest and most efficient energy to have ever been available to humanity? Then, hallelujah, bitcoin mining is the best thing to ever happen for renewables! For if renewables truly are the cheapest and most efficient energy then it is inevitable that bitcoin miners will use almost exclusively renewables (absent government subsidization of less efficient energies).  And what if you believe the mighty atom is the ideal energy source? What if you look up at the sun and intuit that if nature produces all of its energy via nuclear reactions, then it stands to reason that nuclear reactions are the most efficient way the universe has to produce energy. Once again, hallelujah! Bitcoin mining will be the best thing to ever happen to nuclear power! Let's get going and split some atoms!  Whichever view turns out to be correct, whichever one actually generates energy more efficiently, is the one that bitcoin mining will help the most in the long term.  The only way we will make any progress towards our energy future is by building, using, operating, repairing and improving our energy production knowledge, processes and resources.  The more energy we use, the more jobs there are working in energy and the more energy researchers and innovators that will be funded by the flows of capital throughout the world economy.  The amount of capital that is being invested in energy, even including the recent financing of renewables, has fallen precipitously over the last century as a percentage of total capital investments. How are we supposed to build our energy future if we aren't investing in it?  Rather than wait for some government to recognize this issue and centrally allocate capital, let's unleash the natural incentives so beautifully delivered by the Bitcoin network.  Growth, not de-growth  Using more energy is not at odds with environmental initiatives and it certainly isn’t at odds with civilizational and economic prosperity. No matter which future you want, it will require better mastery of energy, and Bitcoin helps build that future.  The biggest objectors to this view are those who think humanity needs to produce and consume less, sometimes called “de-growthers.” In other words, they believe we must engage in energy austerity – we must stop economic growth, and conserve our resources as much as possible.  Is it actually politically, economically and socially possible to engage in de-growth, considering our economy is built on steady economic growth? Is it fair to force economic stagnation on people around the world, especially those still using less electricity per day than my refrigerator?  De-growth is not a feasible political objective regardless of whether it is right or wrong, necessary or not. I don't believe that governments can get the world to support the policies needed to use less energy and less hope for their children to lead better lives than they did. It is a utopian pipe dream, not realpolitik.  No matter what views you hold on energy, climate change or economic growth, the single pathway available to human civilization is to solve the age old question of producing sustainable, abundant energy.  How do we produce energy cheaper, cleaner and more efficiently? How do we find new energy resources? How do we produce an abundant world for a vibrant global population?  Bitcoin’s energy use is part of the answer to these questions. Bitcoin helps us advance human energy mastery, which is a worthwhile end to pursue, as it is good for both human prosperity and our ability to minimize our environmental impact.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING,Steven Lubka,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/08/23/the-more-energy-bitcoin-uses-the-better,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dc6f3fdecdc15b0eddb88b9aa6110e9d0be9d0d0-2088x1566.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Celsius, in particular, left a gaping hole in the crypto lending industry due to their unsustainable business model and risky, off-platform practices. Now, as Celsius attends its bankruptcy trial, analysts are gathering around to see just what went wrong and how crypto lenders can improve sustainability going forward. Why did Celsius Network collapse? This week, crypto lending platform Celsius filed for bankruptcy. A move that came with no surprise. Ever since Celsius froze its user&apos;s assets a few weeks ago, it was just a matter of time before the once powerful lending platform collapsed. But how did they get to that point, to begin with? Last year, CEO Alex Mashinsky announced that Celsius has a total of $25 billion in assets under management. Now, that number is down to just $156 million.

42374010,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWmqf,1661256494,Hackers Lose 5 Ether While Trying to Attack Near Protocol’s Rainbow Bridge,"Attackers trying to exploit Near Protocol’s Rainbow bridge lost some 5 ether (ETH), or just over US$8,000 at current rates, over the weekend after automated security processes by the bridge’s validators kicked in and mitigated the threat in under 31 seconds.  Blockchain-based bridges allow users to send and receive tokens between different networks by locking native tokens on either side. Rainbow allows users to send tokens among the Ethereum, Near and Aurora networks and has over $2.3 billion in assets locked on the protocol, data shows.  Rainbow developer Alex Shevchenko said in a note Monday that an attacker submitted a fabricated Near block to the Rainbow bridge contract over the weekend by putting up a “safe deposit” of 5 ether.  That transaction was successfully submitted to the Ethereum network, with the attacker expecting Rainbow developers to be unavailable to mitigate any threats. “[The] attacker was hoping that it would be complicated to react to the attack early Saturday morning,” Shevchenko explained.  The attacker likely intended to fake transactions and trick Rainbow’s smart contracts into releasing locked funds without depositing any initial funds. Such a sophisticated mechanism has previously been used to exploit several blockchain bridges, such as Nomad’s recent $200 million exploit.  But Rainbow’s validators automatically caught the fabricated block that the attacker tried to submit, challenged and blocked the transaction, and took away the safe deposit of 5 ether put up by the attacker.  This was possible because of how the Rainbow bridge works. As a wholly decentralized platform, Rainbow relies on several validators, called bridge relayers, who submit block info on Near blocks to Ethereum. Anyone can submit information to Rainbow, and false information could likely result in a loss of all user funds.  However, this is where the validators step in: They agree on which transactions are genuine by tracking blockchain activity on all networks connected to Rainbow. Incorrect transactions are challenged by independent “watchdogs” who observe the Near blockchain to check for data misfits, with incorrect transactions getting flagged and eventually blocked.  Such a mechanism protects the network from seeing potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, especially as bridge attacks become more commonplace.  In late June, attackers linked to North Korean hacker group Lazarus exploited a vulnerability in Harmony's Horizon Bridge to steal over $100 million. In March, Axie Infinity’s Ronin Network was exploited for over $625 million, while Solana-based cross-chain bridge Wormhole lost over $325 million to attackers in February.",POSITIVE,ETH,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | NEAR,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/08/23/hackers-lose-5-ether-while-trying-to-attack-near-protocols-rainbow-bridge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fa7ec2bac578cef52edfc636dcc122e7bb33ac66-1200x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

With a market cap of $356 million, the intraday trading volume of Convex Finance has increased by 12% to reach $14.51 million.

Sudorare was a fork of decentralized NFT marketplace SudoSwap, known for its liquidity pools for NFTs and cheaper gas fees, and LooksRare (LOOKS), another NFT marketplace that rewards users for their participation on the platform. Both projects have gained popularity among crypto circles in the past year.  Sudorare offered a yield farm to users who staked LOOKs, XMON and wETH for its own tokens over one week.  However, blockchain data from Tuesday morning shows Sudorare developers illicitly emptied the LOOKS liquidity pool just six hours after it went live, swapping over 1 million LOOKS for 154 ether and 60,000 USDC in one such transaction, and thus pulling off a colloquial “rug pull.” The developers stole over 514 ether in all, valued at just over $815,000 at current rates.  In decentralized finance (DeFi), rug pulls are scams where the developers conduct legitimate work on a blockchain and then drain the liquidity pools from the project, essentially ""pulling the rug"" from under investors and causing a sharp fall in related tokens.

In an interview on FT's Tech Tonic podcast, Dixon said that power on the internet is currently held by a small group of companies.  ""I don’t think this is a good outcome,"" Dixon said. ""The idea of having the internet controlled by five companies is very bad for entrepreneurs and bad for VCs.”  Since the start of the crypto arm in 2018, a16z has raised more than $7.6 billion to invest in crypto and blockchain companies. That includes its fourth crypto fund, established in May with $4.5 billion even as the market tumbled. Bitcoin has fallen from last November's record high of $69,000 to as low as $17,000 in June.  Dixon said he views the slide as a chance to make more investments: “In venture capital, you’re hopefully buying low and selling high ... so my experience has been downturns have been opportunities.”  Several leading names in traditional finance are beginning to use blockchain technology on a daily basis. On Monday, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. (DTCC), which processes all trades in the U.S. stock market, said it is handling hundreds of thousands of settlement transactions a day on its private Project Ion blockchain, while French bank BNP Paribas is using JPMorgan's blockchain network, Onyx.

In Germany, whether you get your money back from failed crypto projects depends on the details of insolvency law and exact conditions of the service, BaFin said, in an amendment to a February warning on crypto investments.  Recent collapses such as crypto lender Celsius Network have led to messy bankruptcy cases, where ex-customers must fight for their money back as part of lengthy legal proceedings.  If trading platforms or wallet providers turn south or go bust, ""there is no protection covering customer losses, such as deposit guarantee schemes or investor compensation schemes,"" the statement from BaFin says.

1632149,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=245435,1661245213,Why Trading Volume Matters in Crypto Investment,"Crypto investors use crypto volume to measure how frequently an asset is trading hands. This is for determining how popular it is to purchase or sell that asset at any specific time. Investors look at the trade volume for various securities, such as stocks, bonds, and foreign currencies. Trading volume is a crucial indicator that traders consider when predicting a coin&apos;s future course, especially in cryptocurrencies. What Does Crypto Trading Volume Mean? The cryptocurrency trading volume indicates how many times a coin has changed hands in a specific period. Investors examine the volume of cryptocurrency traded on either a typical crypto exchange or all exchanges combined. The most typical time frame for measuring volume is 24 hours, and a bar chart is this statistic&apos;s most characteristic visual representation. Generally, crypto trade with high volume can imply rising prices, whereas trading with low volume can signal falling prices. Importance of Crypto Volume in Trading So, why is crypto volume important?

That is the message from a weekly chart momentum indicator, which is about to flash the first bearish signal in over three years.  Bitcoin's 50-week simple moving average (SMA) is trending south and looks set to drop below the 100-week SMA in a week or two, confirming the so-called bearish crossover, the first since February 2019.  While in theory the upcoming bearish cross would imply strengthening of bearish momentum, the indicator has a perfect record of trapping sellers on the wrong side of the market, similar to the negative SMA crossover confirmed on the three-day chart last month.  Bearish crossovers dated April 2015 and February 2019 proved to be contrary indicators – those that tell you to bet against the herd.  It remains to be seen if upcoming crossover marks peak selling. Per Delphi Digital, the cryptocurrency could bottom out in November.  ""From the previous two cycles, BTC bottomed out 59 and 53 weeks following its cycle top.

The complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, also accuses the company of causing financial harm to users by locking them out of their accounts permanently or for long periods of time, as well as violating federal law by listing securities on its trading platform.  Coinbase, which last year became the first cryptocurrency exchange to go public in the U.S., is facing a string of lawsuits from unhappy investors. In addition to another aspiring class action lawsuit filed in New Jersey alleging the company allowed U.S. persons to trade unregistered securities, earlier this month, a Coinbase shareholder accused the company of misleading investors about last year's public listing. The platform is also trying to settle two separate lawsuits filed by investors through arbitration.  The Georgia lawsuit represents a class of more than 100 people, including lead plaintiff and Georgia resident George Kattula, though Kattula's attorneys say there may be more victims.  “We are aware of a large number of fraudulent transactions in the accounts of Coinbase customers,"" said John Herman of Herman Jones LLC, the Georgia-based law firm representing Kattula, in an emailed statement to CoinDesk. ""We are encouraging all Coinbase account holders to review their accounts carefully and advise us promptly of any irregular activity.""  The lawsuit details some of these alleged issues, citing a 2019 incident in which the exchange reportedly took over six months to let a customer back into their own account, a pattern the suit alleges the company repeated.  Coinbase first requires customers to use its support team, and if the issue is not resolved that way, customers then have to go through the ""Formal Complaint Process,"" the complaint said.  ""If that fails to resolve the customer’s dispute, only then can customers attempt to resolve disputes through arbitration. But Coinbase systemically fails to follow those pre-arbitration dispute resolution mechanisms as set forth in the User Agreement, thereby rendering the provision, including its delegation provision, void ...,"" the filing said.  Moreover, the suit alleges that some of the assets listed on Coinbase match the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) definition of a security, and the company itself may be an ""exchange"" under federal law, meaning it would have to register with the regulator.  Read more: Coinbase Loses Bid to Force Arbitration in Crypto Theft Lawsuit  The lawsuits began piling up this year after the SEC said it was investigating Coinbase over the alleged sale of crypto securities in July.  “Coinbase’s user growth has outpaced its ability to provide the account services and protections it promises to consumers,” Kattula's complaint said.  The suit alleges Coinbase’s failure to ""establish and maintain adequate cybersecurity measures"" caused investors to lose their ""wallet and account access, the assets and investments in those accounts"" as well as ""sensitive personally identifiable information stored in their Coinbase accounts, and, among other things, their investment opportunities.""  Kattula's suit is seeking damages exceeding $5 million (excluding his legal costs and fees), a binding judgement, and injunctive relief, which is an order to prohibit involved parties from carrying out certain activities.

Even I didn’t know I’m going to be there.”  “There” was Blockchain Economy Istanbul, held July 27-28 and billed as Eurasia’s largest blockchain conference. Conference organizers said 3,000 people showed up along with 50 speakers, including Alex Bornyakov, the face of war-torn Ukraine’s crypto movement.  Read More: Ukraine Bought Weapons, Drones With Crypto Donations  But the absences were noticeable. Big players like exchanges Binance, FTX and Coinbase (COIN) didn’t have exhibitions. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao did appear in Turkey – via a virtual meeting with the country’s finance minister on the same day as the conference. At a conference touted as the “meeting place for the world’s top crypto companies and blockchain entrepreneurs,” four fireside chats, six panels and 20 keynote addresses were dotted with empty seats, according to attendees.  Given that the crypto bear market was still rampaging, no-shows should probably have been expected.  “The way they marketed it paints a different picture,” said Tony Dhanjal, the head of tax at Koinly, a company that helps track and report crypto taxes. “When you look at it empirically, that did not look like 3,000 people – rather, no more than 1,000. Perhaps, the lack of attendance was reflected in the fact we are in a bear market.”  Others like Didi Wiboonma, chief communications officer of Bitazza.com, praised the diversity in the attendance but said she had come “a long way from Thailand and so was expecting a little bit more advanced content.”  “The conference is less crowded, welcoming and interactive than I anticipated,” said Kimia Hosseinpour, 25, who came with higher expectations after quitting her job as a mechanical engineer, selling her car and vacating her apartment in Washington, D.C., so she could travel. “I enjoyed some of the panels more than the walking around.”  “One may have seen dotted empty seats in the main hall because the attendees were in the expo area,” said organizers from Teklip, while pointing to the post-event report that reflected a sharp decline in onsite attendance post lunch.  “Attendees decide for themselves whether they would like to listen to speeches or explore exhibitions and network. Also, the smoking area at the entrance of the venue was crowded the whole time. The workshop was also carried out.”  Among speakers, long-time Bitcoin evangelist Michael Saylor was the biggest draw, but India-based Fahad Th, an attendee, told CoinDesk he would not have turned up if he knew Saylor would only speak virtually.  “We had the symbol of a phone next to Saylor’s name indicating he would be on video,” said Servi Aman, the event’s head from Teklip, an advertising and media company.  But there was another lesson lurking: Crypto is thriving in Turkey. Eurasia as a region doesn’t have many prominent crypto hubs. Istanbul, the region's financial capital for centuries, is emerging as one and people there showed plenty of enthusiasm, even if crypto bigshots weren’t in attendance at the massive Hilton Istanbul Bomonti Hotel.  The smoking area at the hotel's convention floor reflected that local buzz. At any given point in time, with smokes in hand and an idea on their lips, dozens of Turkey’s crypto enthusiasts reflected on protocols, pitched journalists, and discussed partnerships.     Several announcements made at the event indicated what was visible in the exhibitor hall: an obliviousness to the crypto bear market, especially when there was a Turkish connection.  Crypto exchange AAX announced its expansion in Turkey, appointing a crypto lawyer and ex-Binance official, Anadolu Aydınlı, as its country director. AAX’s confidence in Turkey was based on a study it commissioned that found 16% of Turkey’s population – approximately 13.6 million people – own bitcoin (BTC).  The paparazzi crowded Engin Altan Düzyatan, the star of the globally acclaimed series “Resurrection: Ertuğrul” – the Turkish “Game of Thrones” – as he announced he’s now the co-founder of a metaverse game based on the show titled “Medieval Empires: Ertugrul.”  A child-like curiosity was in the air, best exemplified by students from the blockchain community of Cankaya University, based in Turkey’s capital, Ankara.  The students sealed an impromptu partnership with QAN, a Quantum resistant layer 1 hybrid blockchain. The deal included QAN providing guest lectures and starting a talent management program at the university.  One young man stood out for not being where he should be – in school. A 15-year-old crypto trader named Efe Kelemci came to Istanbul to achieve his larger aim to educate teens to be financially independent, something he started doing through crypto at age 13 with $1,000 he saved up from birthdays. In Istanbul, he attempted to take it a step further, seeking partnerships for his upcoming decentralized finance (DeFi) venture.  It didn’t matter to Kelemci that crypto big shots didn’t come. Local enthusiasm, and the presence of notable even if not the biggest companies such as Gari Network, Uphold and KuCoin were enough to satisfy his youthful exuberance.

This has pushed the coin quite close to its next price resistance. The bulls were back on the 24 hour chart and that depicted positive price action for the coin. Despite Bitcoin falling on the chart and other major altcoins moving south EOS noted a considerable surge in price.
