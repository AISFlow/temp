42426605,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuNFh,1450824690,2015 Was the Year of the Blockchain,"Chris Skinner is a banking and technology veteran who serves as the chairman of the Financial Services Club, a group created in 2004 to address the future of companies that serve financial markets.  The world is still very confused about bitcoin.  For example, some press are still writing the old stories about the phenomena as an investment: Man buys $27 worth of bitcoin, forgets about them, finds they're now worth $886,000.  It makes for a good headline, but reinforces the view that bitcoin is just some basketcase currency, rather than a currency that should put into a basket of currencies.  This will change.  In fact, some banks are already starting to say bitcoin good, blockchain good, rather than bitcoin bad, blockchain good.  Changing tide  On this note, there’s a really interesting commentary from Deutsche Bank, which released a research note this week.  In the note, analyst Heike Mai notes that ""the original idea of bitcoin – to create a peer-to-peer scheme that is independent of intermediaries and central agents – is to some degree being overhauled by real life. The bitcoin ecosystem now includes a number of financial intermediaries, like wallet providers and exchanges, and these show a trend towards concentration.""  All this in the same week as Satoshi Nakamoto has been identified as an Australian academic called Craig Steven Wright, or is he? Some say that Mr Wright was part of an extortion scheme.  We shall see, but it seems to me that Satoshi is still to be found, and Cornell Professor Emin Gün Sirer kind of tells us as it is: Who cares?  Anyways, attending a discussion about blockchain and bitcoin earlier this week, I heard the simplest summary of what it’s all about.  Bitcoin is a currency, a method of value exchange and a smart way to record contracts. As a technology it is good at these three things, and that’s what we should focus upon.  For banks, the permissioned and shared ledger structures enabled by bitcoin technology provide value exchange and smart contracts is what the whole financial system has woken up to, which is why we talk about blockchain more than bitcoin.  Private ledgers enable banks to exchange value in a trusted shared network, and that network can be backed by USD, EUR or RMB, no bitcoin required.  The 'no bitcoin required' systems are all based upon private shared structures, and the key to this is to remember that word shared.  Moving fast  No blockchain development has value in the financial system unless it's shared by a critical mass of people.  Hence R3 is interesting, with Sberbank being the latest bank wanting to join the global consortium of 30 banks and financial institutions. Even SWIFT is finally making commitments to blockchain developments, so these things are moving fast.  Meantime, I remember thinking when UBS announced a ""settlement coin"" on the blockchain that it would go nowhere unless other banks committed. UBS has now designated ownership of the coin to Clearmatics, who are trying to create an R3 for post-trade markets, so these things are moving fast.  In fact some would say, and I’m one of the them, that 2015 has been all about the blockchain.

42426601,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuN3h,1450811593,Right-Wing Reps Seek Bitcoin Powers in European Parliament,"Three European Parliament representatives from a French right-wing political party filed a motion last month seeking to give member-states the power to regulate or even ban bitcoin activities.  The motion  was filed on 25th November, according to a copy of the motion published on the European Parliament website.  The motion seeks approval from the European Commission – the executive arm of the European Union – to “allow Member States to exercise stricter controls over all virtual currency exchange transactions and even to prohibit them”.  Cited as justification is the recent decision by the European Court of Justice to exempt bitcoin trades from value-added tax, as well as moves by the Russian government to put restrictions on activities involving so-called money surrogates, including bitcoin.  The filing further states that such action is needed given “a high level of risk in the bitcoin system”, while also alleging that digital currencies possess “certain similarities with a Ponzi scheme”.  The motion’s three authors – Dominique Bilde, Sophie Montel and Florian Philippot – are all members of France’s Front National. Bilde, Montel and Philippot did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The representatives, all of whom joined the European Parliament in 2014, aren’t the only French politicians with an eye on regulating digital currency activities more stringently.  Speaking to reporters last week ahead of a UN Security Council meeting on terrorist financing and the Islamic State, French Finance Minister Michel Sapin reportedly said that he would push for greater oversight of bitcoin transactions.  ""Carrying bundles of cash in bags is no longer used. Terrorists have a capacity to use all the new technologies to transfer money around so we need together have identical rules in countries,"" Sapin said, according to Reuters.

42426600,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuN7h,1450804141,Australia's Biggest Stock Exchange is Taking a 'Close Look' at Blockchain,"The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) is reportedly considering whether to use blockchain technology to manage trade risk.  According to the Financial Times, ASX CEO Elmer Funke Kupper said in a recent interview that the exchange, Australia's largest, is considering an application of the blockchain as it explores how to go about improving its trading systems.  Funke Kupper told the publication:  “We’re having a very close look at this. The timing is almost perfect. Where blockchain can make an enormous difference, we’re having a look at whether this is a way to transform our equity markets.”  Funke Kupper stressed that ASX isn’t rushing to adopt the technology, thought, and that a decision won’t be made “for another six to seven months”.  The ASX CEO’s comments echo statements from earlier this year, when he told The Sydney Morning-Herald that the stock exchange was weighing whether to enhance its clearing and settlement system using blockchain technology.  ""We are looking at what we can do to bring end-to-end efficiencies, and we have people looking very closely at blockchain to see if we can create efficiencies for our clients, investors and companies,” Funke Kupper said at the time.  Other exchanges have also spent time and resources looking at blockchain applications. Nasdaq unveiled its private markets blockchain project, Linq, last month in Las Vegas, and made waves earlier this year when it partnered with blockchain startup Chain.  More recently, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) signed on to a trade settlement-focused blockchain initiative alongside a team that includes the CME Group and French bank Société Générale. The LSE is also a partner in an open-source blockchain project led by IBM and the Linux Foundation.

42426609,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuNJh,1450788954,Why Insurers Caught the Blockchain Bug in 2015,"Professor Michael Mainelli is executive chairman of Z/Yen Group and principal advisor to Long Finance. His latest book, The Price of Fish: A New Approach to Wicked Economics and Better Decisions, written with Ian Harris, won the 2012 Independent Publisher Book Awards Finance, Investment & Economics Gold Prize.  In this special feature, Mainelli explores how distributed ledgers and blockchains could fully modernise an industry that still relies heavily on paper.  In April 2015, Lloyd’s of London launched the Target Operating Model (TOM) project. TOM is a central body responsible for delivering modernisation to the still heavily paper-based wholesale insurance transactions in the London insurance markets.  You can state ‘I Support TOM’ on a registration site or ‘like’ TOM on social media. There have been several ‘innovation’ events. There is an orange logo reminiscent of the 1990s when ‘orange was the new black’. The project has even tried to coin yet another tech mashup for the London insurance markets surrounding Lloyd’s – ‘InsTech’.  This is not the first time that the London insurance markets have tried to modernise. They are serial reformers, their attempts have had varying degrees of success, from total failure to middling impact.  Limnet (London Insurance Market Network) made progress with electronic data interchange in the 1980s and early 1990s. Electronic Placement Support (EPS) worked in the late 1990s, but few used it. Kinnect, at a cost conservatively quoted as £70m, was abandoned in 2006. Project Darwin, 2011 to 2013, achieved little. The Message Exchange Limited (TMEL) is a messaging hub for ACORD messages that has had modest success, but most people still use email.  Numerous private exchanges or electronic messaging ventures have gained only partial market shares. Xchanging Ins-Sure Services (XIS), a claims and premiums processing joint venture, was formed in 2000 and runs adequately, but there is still a lot of paper involved.  A swift walk round Lloyd’s, perhaps passing by the famous Lamb Tavern in Leadenhall Market, reveals a lot of heavy bundles of paper lengthening the arms of long-term insurers.  Does Ontogeny Recapitulate Phylogeny?  Ernst Haeckel (1834–1919) was a German biologist and philosopher who proposed a (now largely discredited) biological hypothesis, the 'theory of recapitulation'. He proposed that in developing from embryo to adult, animals go through stages resembling or representing successive stages in the evolution of their remote ancestors. His catchphrase was “ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny”.  In a similar way, TOM seems to be going through all the previous stages of former wholesale insurance modernisation projects, databases, networks and messaging centres, but may come out at the end to realise the potential of mutual distributed ledgers (aka blockchain technology).  Information technology systems may have now evolved to meet the demanding requirements of wholesale insurance.  Wholesale insurance differs from capital market finance in some important ways.  First, insurance is a ‘promise to pay in future’, not an asset transfer today. Second, while capital markets trade on information asymmetry, insurance is theoretically a market of perfect information and symmetry – you have to reveal everything of possible relevance to your insurer, but each of you has different exposure positions and interpretations of risk. Third, wholesale insurance is ‘bespoke’. You can’t give your insurance cover to someone else.  These three points lead to a complex set of interactions among numerous parties.  Clients, brokers, underwriters, claims assessors, valuation experts, legal firms, actuaries and accountants all have a part in writing a policy, not to mention handling subsequent claims.  People from the capital markets who believe insurance should become a traded market miss some key points. Let’s examine two: one about market structure and one about technology.  People use trusted third parties in many roles in finance, for settlement, as custodians, as payment providers, as poolers of risk.  Trusted third parties perform three roles, to:  Validate – confirming the existence of something to be traded and membership of the trading community  Safeguard – preventing duplicate transactions, ie: someone selling the same thing twice or ‘double-spending’  Preserve – holding the history of transactions to help analysis and oversight, and in the event of disputes.  Concerns Over Centralisation  The hundreds of firms in the London markets are rightly concerned about a central third party who might hold their information to ransom. They want to avoid natural monopolies, particularly as agreed information is crucial over multi-year contracts. They are also concerned about a central third party that must be used for messaging because, without choice, the natural monopoly rents might become excessive.  Many of the historic reforms failed to propose technology that recognised this market structure. Mutual distributed ledgers (MDLs) though provide pervasive, persistent, and permanent records.  MDL technology securely stores transaction records in multiple locations with no central ownership. MDLs allow groups of people to validate, record and track transactions across a network of decentralised computer systems with varying degrees of control of the ledger.  In such a system, everyone shares the ledger. The ledger itself is a distributed data structure held in part or in its entirety by each participating computer system. Trust in safeguarding and preservation moves from a central third-party to the technology.  Emerging techniques, such as, smart contracts and decentralised autonomous organisations, might in future also permit MDLs to act as automated agents.  Beat the TOM-TOM  Because MDLs enable organisations to work together on common data they exhibit a paradox. MDLs are logically central, but technically distributed. They act as if they are central databases where everyone shares the same information.  However, the information is distributed across multiple, or multitudinous, sites so that no one person can gain control over the value of the information. Everyone has a copy. Everyone can recreate the entire market from someone else’s copy. However, everyone can only ‘see’ what their cryptographic keys permit them.  How do we know this works? We at Z/Yen, a commercial think-tank, have built several insurance application prototypes for clients who seek examples such as motor, small business and insurance deal-rooms. The technical success of blockchain technologies in cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple have shown that complex multi-party transactions are possible using MDLs.  And we have build a system that handles ACORD messages with no need for ‘messaging’.  Z/Yen’s work in this space dates from 1995. Until recently, though, most of those in financial services dismissed MDLs as too complex and insecure.  The recent mania around cryptocurrencies has led to a reappraisal of their potential, as blockchains are just one form of MDL. That said, MDLs are ‘mutual’, and a number of people need to move ahead together.  Further, traditional commercial models of controlling and licensing intellectual property are less likely to be successful at the core of the market. The intellectual property needs to be shared.  A message is getting out on the jungle drums that MDLs, while not easy, do work at a time when people are rethinking the future of wholesale insurance.  If TOM helps push people to work together, perhaps this time market reform will embrace a generation of technology that will finally meet the demands of a difficult, yet essential and successful, centuries-old market.  Perhaps TOM should be beating the MDL drums more loudly.  Insurance image via Shutterstock  Want to share your opinion on bitcoin or blockchain in 2015, or a prediction for the year ahead?
