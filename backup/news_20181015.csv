Coinbase vice president of operations and technology Tina Bhatnagar announced late Monday that the exchange is opening a new office in Dublin, Ireland in response to customer growth in the EU. What's more, it's a helpful backstop against the looming exit of the U.K. from the European Union, known as Brexit.  ""It is also a plan B for Brexit. As we plan for all eventualities, it's important that we continue servicing our customers across Europe, and Ireland would be our preferred choice there if it comes to it,"" Zeeshan Feroz, who leads Coinbase's U.K. efforts, told The Guardian.  Martin Shanahan, CEO of the country's inward investment agency IDA Ireland, said in a statement that ""Dublin is a talent hotspot,"" which would aid Coinbase as it scales up.  He added that the company ""looks forward to welcoming Coinbase into the Irish economy, and helping them access our talented pool of young professionals from the technology and financial services sectors.""  The news comes weeks after the exchange opened a new headquarters in New York to provide services for institutional clients. As previously reported by CoinDesk, this office aims to hire more than 100 employees within the next year.

42429824,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1aBh,1539634214,"Bitfinex Says Withdrawals Are Fine, But Crypto Exchange Customers Disagree","Crypto exchange Bitfinex said Monday that withdrawal services are operating ""without the slightest interference"" – but some of its users would seem to disagree.  ""Processing complications"" led to crypto exchange Bitfinex suspending fiat deposits into customer accounts last week, according to the October 15 blog post. Its move to pause such deposits is a temporary one, and such activities will resume on Tuesday, October 16, according to Bitfinex. Specifically, users hoping to deposit U.S. dollars, British pounds, euros or Japanese yen cannot do so at this point in time.  However, the exchange emphasized that this pause only impacts ""certain customer accounts"" and ""user groups,"" though it did not expand on which accounts or what groups these might be.  Bitfinex said in its post that withdrawals are not affected, yet some of the exchange's customers appear to be facing a number of issues in withdrawing their funds – although the exact number is difficult to parse at present. Such complaints have occurred periodically in past months, which observers have blamed on Bitfinex's reported banking problems that have seen it shift strategies amid an unfriendly regulatory environment.  Indeed, Bitfinex's latest post drew several complaints about yet-to-be-fulfilled withdrawals on social media. @DongoFabrizio, @crypto_bull_in, @botcrypt, @bbc_trading, @ElCuartoAmigo and @rarelylose were just some of the users who reported seeing delays just this morning.  These issues are not new though. Just this month, a number of users on both Twitter and Reddit have commented on issues with recovering their funds.  Bitfinex communications director Kasper Rasmussen said on Reddit that the exchange is ""currently working our way through a backlog of fiat withdrawals,"" in response to one user asking about their funds through a third-party processor.  Rasmussen added:  ""Fiat withdrawals are currently processing, both old and new, but the backlog which is being worked through means that a few users unfortunately continue to experience these delays for a little while longer. Unfortunately I am unable to provide a clearer estimate as to when you will receive your withdrawal, but I can assure you that fiat withdrawals are processing and that your specific transaction is being monitored closely.""  By contrast, Bitfinex's Monday statement says ""all cryptocurrency and fiat withdrawals are, and have been, processing as usual without the slightest interference.""  In a separate statement to CoinDesk, Rasmussen said: ""Fiat withdrawals are still processing and have not experienced any downtime however ... We continue to experience minor delays in the processing of fiat transactions for certain individuals, but this remains the minority of cases.""  As to the size of the backlog itself, Rasmussen described it as ""small,"" adding:  ""There is a multitude of factors which could contribute to a delayed fiat transaction (deposit or withdrawal), many of which outside the realm of our control. I can't comment on the size of this backlog but it represents a minority relative to the number of daily processed transactions at Bitfinex.""  Withdrawing cryptos  Fiat withdrawals aside, some users have noted issues with withdrawing cryptocurrencies from the exchange as well.  Reddit user under_hood commented that their bitcoin withdrawal was delayed by several hours.  Under_hood later told CoinDesk that they temporarily transferred funds into Bitfinex. While they attempted to withdraw their bitcoin after seeing the price fluctuations of USDT stablecoin issued by Tether (a company with close ties to Bitfinex), they have so far not been successful.  ""After [six] hours the transaction was not even sent to the BTC networked[sic]! Hopefully it is just delayed and [I] didn't get Goxed again,"" they added, referring to the loss of funds when the Mt. Gox exchange collapsed in 2014.  Similarly, Twitter user @JaPennz said withdrawals were not working as normal, and that they could not transfer funds from margin wallets to their exchange wallet.  They told CoinDesk that their USD funds were temporarily unavailable Monday after bitcoin's price spiked on the exchange.  ""However, it all became available in a couple hours,"" they added. Due to the ongoing concerns about USDT, the user ""converted the available USD in my exchange wallet to XRP and [withdrew] the XRP.""  However, even this withdrawal took three or four hours, they explained.  That being said, the system appears to be working again, they said. In a follow-up statement, they explained that ""everything now is good though so I assume it had to do with the BTC pump and likely people exiting tether and maybe overloaded their system.""  Bitfinex spokesman Rasmussen said these cases were the exception rather than the rule. ""Cryptocurrency deposits and withdrawals continue to be fully functioning as well,"" Rasmussen told CoinDesk.  While ""certain individuals or tokens/coins"" may be experiencing delays in withdrawing funds, ""this again wouldn't be a widespread issue and could be due to a number of factors, both on our end and that of the user,"" he explained.

""Those efforts have been successful in helping us understand and advance our thinking around cryptocurrencies ... The creation of Fidelity Digital Assets is the first step in a long-term vision to create a full-service enterprise-grade platform for digital assets,"" he said, going on to add:    ""In our conversations with institutions, they tell us that in order to engage with digital assets in a meaningful way, they need a trusted platform provider to enter this space. These institutions require a sophisticated level of service and security, equal to the experience they're used to when trading stocks or bonds.""            As such, Fidelity plans to build a ""scalable infrastructure"" that takes advantage of Fidelity's existing experience in building such platforms, he said.  At launch, the new company will offer ""institutional-grade custody,"" trade execution and ""dedicated client service,"" the press release continued.  The platform will custody bitcoin, ethereum and other yet-to-be-named cryptocurrencies at launch.

According to a press release from the firm Monday, the system will help manage copyright-related information for digital content, citing educational content as a prime use case. The firm states that, with content rights management currently largely being carried out manually by industry organizations or the creators themselves, its new system is designed to make that process more efficient.  Using the platform, participants will be able to share and verify information such as date and time of creation, and the author's details. It will also automatically verify the rights generation of a piece of written works, the firm adds.  Digital content such as ebooks, music, video, virtual reality content and more are said to be supported by the new system, which is based on a similar system developed by the conglomerate previously. Sony says is now considering the possible commercialization of the system as a service.  The Japan-based firm is no stranger to blockchain innovation.  Last month, research by iPR Daily, a media outlet specializing in intellectual property, showed that Sony is in the top 30 companies for blockchain-related patents, having filed at least 20 applications. Notably, some of those point towards the direction Sony has taken with the system announced today.  As CoinDesk reported in April, one of the patents filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office describes a concept that stores digital rights data using blockchain. The company has also filed for inventions including a system to authenticate user data and manage education data.

Withdrawal functionality has since been returned, according to Binance's website, which previously stated ""wallet maintenance, withdrawal suspended"" on the page for USDT. A customer service administrator on the platform's English-language Telegram channel had previously said that the suspension was due to ""USDT network congestion.""  In another message, an administrator in the channel said earlier Monday that the ""maintenance [is] due to network congestion. Expected date/time cannot be provided. We are fixing it as soon as possible.""  The outage was the second to occur on Binance Monday – the exchange suspended USDT withdrawals earlier in the day, though customers were able to briefly resume withdrawals around 11:33 UTC. Roughly 15 minutes later, withdrawals were suspended again.  Binance had earlier disavowed rumors that it was moving to delist USDT, with founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao calling it ""a single photoshopped fake announcement"" in a tweet Monday.  When reached for comment, Zhao told CoinDesk:  ""I have no comment on that for now, the company will let the public know of the new developments once its concluded.""  As previously reported by CoinDesk, USDT's price sank to an 18-month low of $0.925 Monday morning. The loss of its dollar peg would seem to contradict a long-existing statement on Tether's website, which states that ""USD₮ is always equivalent to 1 USD.""  Prior to the suspension, Binance's bitcoin-USDT trading pair hit a high of $7,680, well above the global average price.

Rolling out the new additions over Monday and Tuesday, the exchange said in a support notice that it will list TrustToken's TrueUSD (TUSD), Circle's USDCoin (USDC), the Gemini Dollar (GUSD) from the Winklevoss-founded New York exchange and Paxos Standard Token (PAX).  The latter three tokens were all launched by their respective companies in September, while TrustToken was ahead of the pack with a March release.  At press time, OKEx is the fifth-largest exchange by volume for bitcoin, and the third-largest for the tether stablecoin, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  The OKEx listing news comes as controversy over the most commonly used stablecoin, tether (USDT), is only building.  Confidence in the token – which is widely used by traders and exchanges to quickly move funds without the need to convert back into U.S. dollars – has been fading in recent months over the perception that USDT developer Tether LLC and its sister firm, crypto exchange Bitfinex are not transparent over the actual amount of USD being held to back the stablecoin.  Some exchanges have already moved to drop tether, and the recent launching of new alternatives may only increase that likelihood.  In other related news, a major sell-off in tether early today saw the price of bitcoin surge to its highest level for a month as its premium on Bitfinex climbed to around $600 over the global average at one stage this morning.  With the sell-off, Tether fell to an 18-month low of $0.925284 at 07:00 UTC, according to CoinMarketCap data. At press time, USDT had returned to $0.962815.  OKEx said it will start accepting deposits in the four new stablecoins from 17:00 local time today (09:00 UTC), with spot trading in pairs against bitcoin and tether to start Tuesday at 14:00 HKT (06:00 UTC). Withdrawals in the newly listed tokens will commence three hours later.  In a similar statement, crypto exchange FCoin said it would add the same stablecoins to its platform, though it did not provide a timeline.

Patrick McFarlin, a councilor of Plattsburgh's Common Council, proposed a new law last week that aims to introduce ""zoning regulations"" for commercial crypto mining activities. According to an update from the council Friday, a public hearing will now be held on Oct. 25 to determine whether to follow through with the proposal.  The suggested zoning rules cover a variety of categories such as fire safety, heat, nuisance abatement and special use permits. If approved, crypto mining farm operators in the city would immediately be required to keep the ambient temperature inside their facilities within 120 degrees Fahrenheit (48.8 degrees Celsius) at any time.  Should the average daily temperature outside the facilities be less than 40 degrees F (4.4 degrees C), mining farm operators must ensure that ""no more than 20 percent of the heat dissipated by the mining activity shall be released directly to the outside.""  The councilor further suggested enforcing a cap on noise generated by mining farms.  ""No mining operation should produce more than 90 decibels (dB) from a distance of 25 feet from the exterior of the containment structure, to avoid any adverse effects for the residents,"" he detailed in the proposal.  The suggested rules follow a decision made by the city in March to introduce an 18-month moratorium on new mining operations after residents raised concerns over increased electricity costs and other issues.

42411156,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gjOKxz,1539602464,Startup Bringing Blockchain Privacy to Central Banks Wins $15 Million Funding,"Blockchain startup Adhara, which boasts a stellar line-up of former banking innovators, has secured $15 million in new funding from Consensys, the ethereum design studio.  The funding will help Adhara continue its work on international payments, which includes introducing central banks to the type of cryptography normally confined to math labs and academic circles.  For example, Adhara has been exploring zero knowledge proof technology (a way of allowing someone to prove that they have knowledge of a secret without revealing the secret itself). And it's combining that with other forms of cryptography in order to get a better performance on a blockchain – all inside the industry-grade payments mechanism of the South African Reserve Bank.  Stepping back, Adhara grew out of Consensys South Africa, with Peter Munnings, former head of blockchain at FirstRand Bank in South Africa, as one of the co-founders. The other two co-founders are also heavy hitters: Julio Faura, Santander's former blockchain lead, and Edward Budd, former chief digital officer at Deutsche Bank.  In his first interview since leaving Santander, Faura told CoinDesk that the team is ""religious"" about the holy trinity of tokenized cash, smart contracts and decentralized ledgers, which, on Adhara's platform, was implemented via a modified version of Quorum, the privacy-centric fork of ethereum.  ""Our approach needs a single, shared, smart contract-enabled ledger where tokenized fiat can be issued and used as a basic building block,"" said Faura, ""and the only real option out there at the moment is ethereum, in whatever flavor.""  He added:  ""If you are religious – like we are – about tokenization, you can see it unlocking possibilities to mix this with other assets; trading with a digital representation of value means you can focus on other aspects of the financial industry.""  Budd also highlighted the much-vaunted concept of tokenized fiat currency, saying: ""Whether derived from a central bank or a commercial bank, it's the only practical way to drive adoption within regulated financial institutions.""  Full of praise for his ""family"" at Santander, Faura explained that, as well to satisfy an entrepreneurial urge, his decision to leave was driven by his passion to solve real-world problems – something he said is hard to do within a large and highly regulated bank.  ""The challenge today is bringing blockchain technology to real things, and I think this is best done from an agile startup that can independently serve many institutions,"" he said.  Solving problems  Adhara's work demonstrates a notable advancement on another central banking blockchain test, Project Ubin – a November 2017 trial of digital ledger tech hosted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and involving R3's Corda, Hyperledger Fabric and Quorum.  The work done by Adhara to process and settle international payments involving the South African Reserve Bank (SARB), dubbed Project Khokha, addressed a number of pain points, such as reconciling what happens at either end of a payment between a mish-mash of disconnected ledgers and the problem of continually rebalancing accounts via the central bank.  Not only did Project Khokha pass SARB's required stress tests, it also picked up ""best distributed ledger initiative"" award from industry publication Central Banking.  In order to meet those real-world requirements, the team had to make some clever modifications to the computationally heavy cryptography used by the Quorum team in Project Ubin, since ""preserving privacy at scale using classical zero knowledge proofs, as they exist in Quorum, is challenging,"" noted Budd.  Faura echoed this, saying that using zero-knowledge proofs for banking accounts systems is possible, but ""becomes a scalability problem very soon.""  In the MAS test, Ubin, Quorum was processing one transaction every 14 seconds. Throughput for Project Khokha, though, was 70,000 in 90 minutes (rounded to 13 transactions per second) – carried out using simplified zero knowledge proofs called ""range proofs.""  ""Range proofs have proven to be a way simpler and more performant way to achieve the same effect of zero knowledge proofs. And our aspiration of course is to build networks that will be joined by hundreds or thousands of banks,"" said Faura.  Innovation focus  Adhara co-founder Peter Munnings drilled down into the key differences between the work done on Project Ubin using Quorum and the way the tech was modified for Khokha.  In Ubin, a zero knowledge proof was used to prove that the resulting balance was made up of the starting balance plus or minus the amount transferred, depending on the direction of the transaction. That proof took around 4 seconds to generate and about 50ms to verify, and used a vast amount of RAM, Munnings noted. Those proofs were published to the blockchain.  In Khokha, a special type of encryption hash called Pedersen commitments were used to provide a way of committing to a chosen value (or chosen statement) while keeping it hidden to others, and having the ability to reveal the value later.  ""Pedersen commitments are extremely lightweight and fast, but they have one small problem,"" said Munnings. ""You don't know if a Pedersen commitment represents a positive or a negative number.""  ""So along with the Pedersen commitments, the banks also had to produce two range proofs. One that proved that the amount being transferred was positive and the second, from the sender, that the resulting balance after the transaction was still positive, i.e. the bank wasn't going into deficit,"" he said.  Despite the complexity of combining Pedersen commitments and range proofs to achieve the performance improvements on Khokha, Budd said the project didn't feel at all ""sterile and lab-based""  This was thanks in large part to SARB's innovation mandate and its emphasis on practicalities, he said.  ""They have policy objectives about inclusion within the region and innovation in the market that's equally driving them to engage in these types of projects,"" said Budd, concluding:  ""It's not because the tech is interesting that someone should do a project.""  100 rand note image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/10/15/startup-bringing-blockchain-privacy-to-central-banks-wins-15-million-funding,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1f4c8820b85170c32921a1d207e91f0266030d1c-1500x715.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42401988,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3BCP,1539601810,Bitcoin Price Spikes But Bull Reversal Is Still $1K Away,"Bitcoin (BTC) spiked 11 percent Monday, likely due to a sell-off in tether (USDT), but a bullish reversal is still not confirmed, technical charts indicate.  The leading cryptocurrency jumped to a 2.5-month high of $7,788 at 06:45 UTC on Bitfinex – the cryptocurrency exchange that manages USDT developer Tether LLC.  Interestingly, the stablecoin was down 2 percent just before BTC picked up a bid at 05:00 UTC, and fell further to an 18-month low of $0.925284 at 07:00 UTC, as per CoinMarketCap.  The unusual drop indicates investors have moved money out of USDT and into bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies – possibly on a fresh round of doubts over whether the stablecoin is fully backed by dollars.  Further, there's evidence of growing interest in emerging stablecoins like Paxos Standard (PAX), TrueUSD (TUSD) and Gemini Dollar (GUSD), which all reported gains during the USDT sell-off.  More importantly, the majority of the rapid gains in BTC likely happened via trading on Bitfinex, where prices rose well above $7,000. Notably, the premium carried by bitcoin prices on Bitfinex rose above $600 early in the European day. Meanwhile, on non-tether-enabled platforms like Coinbase's GDAX, prices only peeped above $6,800.  At press time, BTC's average price across various exchanges, as calculated by CoinDesks's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), is $6,510, representing a 4.6 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  On Bitfinex, the leading cryptocurrency is trading at $6,837, while on Coinbase, it is changing hands at $6,824, meaning BTC is still trading at a premium of $400 on Bitfinex.  Daily chart  As seen in the above chart (prices as per Coinbase), BTC's rally has neutralized the immediate bearish view put forward by last week's downside break of the rising trendline.  However, a bullish reversal would be confirmed only after the cryptocurrency has found acceptance above the Sept. 4 high of $7,402.  Moreover, bulls are not out of the woods yet as the following key resistance levels are still intact:  $6,462 (trendline falling from July highs)  $6,823 (Sept. 22 high)  $7,090 (trendline connecting March highs and July highs)  Meanwhile, major support is seen at $6,150 (today's low), $6,000 (February low) and $5,777 (June 24 low). So, it seems safe to say that there is more room on the downside than upside.  View  The immediate outlook is neutral and the pullback from highs above $6,800 has kept the bears in the game.  A UTC close above $7,090 (long-term falling trendline) would boost the prospects of bullish reversal above $7,402.  On the downside, a move below $6,150 (today's low) would put the bears back into the driver's seat, allowing a drop to June lows below $5,800.

Yao Qian, who founded the Digital Currency Research Lab at the People's Bank of China (PBoC) last year, has now taken up the role of general manager at the China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation (CSDC), according to an update from the firm on Monday.  He joined the firm this month, having left the PBoC in September, the CSDC says.  Yao was notably featured as one of the most influential individuals in blockchain by CoinDesk in 2017, due to his efforts in leading the PBoC's development of a digital yuan.  While it remains unclear who will now fill the lead role at the digital currency lab, the news comes just days after it announced a new round of job openings, looking for both legal and technical experts to focus on the CBDC development.  Yao joins CSDC at a time when the state-owned entity – incorporated in 2000 and overseen by China's securities regulators – is supporting initiatives in the country aiming to adopt blockchain in the traditional financial system.  CoinDesk reported as far back as 2016 that the CSDC had signed an agreement with its counterpart in Russia to partner on blockchain applications for post-trade settlements.  More recently, the CSDC's Shanghai branch supported a domestic commercial bank using a blockchain to issue asset-backed securities (ABSs) worth $66 million.  Yao published an op-ed last Monday, Oct. 8 , in which he was still being cited as the PBoC's digital currency research head. The article indicated the PBoC is developing a blockchain system for the ABS market in China.

42401985,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3BAR,1539592820,Price of 'Stable' Cryptocurrency Tether Tanks to 18-Month Low,"UPDATE (10/15, 7:50 PM EST): Representatives from Tether have released a statement, attributed to chief compliance officer Leonardo Real. The statement comes hours after the USDT price fell below its peg to hit a low of $0.92 Monday morning and, later, temporarily rose back to $1 per token.  As of press time, USDT is trading for roughly $0.95 on Kraken.  Real was quoted as saying:  ""Tether is the leading provider of tokenized fiat currencies and is listed on many exchanges worldwide. We would like to reiterate that although markets have shown temporary fluctuations in price, all USDT in circulation are sufficiently backed by U.S. dollars (USD) and that assets have always exceeded liabilities. In June 2018, a report from Freeh Sporkin & Sullivan, LLP (FSS), based on a random date balance inspection and a full review of relevant documentation of bank accounts, confirmed that all Tethers in circulation as of that date were indeed fully backed by USD reserves.""      The price of the tether stablecoin (USDT) has fallen to an 18-month low Monday, despite a general rise in the wider crypto markets.  The tether-US dollar exchange rate (USDT/USD) fell to $0.925284 at 07:00 UTC – the lowest level since April 27, 2017 – and was last seen trading at $0.967296, representing a 2 percent drop on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinMarketCap.  The slide in the USDT price has pushed up the premium carried by bitcoin (BTC) prices on the Bitfinex exchange above $600.  As of writing, bitcoin is trading at an average of $6,617 across global exchanges, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), having clocked a 5.5-week high of $6,960 earlier today.  However, on Bitfinex, BTC is changing hands at $7,055, meaning prices are trading at a premium of $438 to the BPI. The leading cryptocurrency rose as high as $7,788 on Bitfinex, which operates Tether LLC, the firm that developed the USDT token.  Some reports are putting the price drop down to traders losing faith in the token, amid claimed lack of transparency over tether's true USD holdings and rumored issues at partner firm Bitfinex.  Interestingly, other recently introduced stablecoins like Gemini Dollar (GUSD) and TrueUSD (TUSD) are up 1.85 percent and 4.96 percent, respectively.  Whatever the reason for the drop, it seems safe to say that traders have likely rotated money out of USDT and into bitcoin and other stablecoins.

42401980,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3B7U,1539590417,Blockchain Refresh: Why KPMG's New Strategy Focuses on Customs,"KPMG has decided to ""refresh"" its distributed ledger technology (DLT) strategy, according to new U.S. blockchain lead Arun Ghosh, who took over the group in September.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the Big Four consultancy has taken to expanding its blockchain activities beyond the pure financial services work it had been doing, to explore a less-traveled path.  Specifically, KPMG is homing in on the point where cross-border manufacturing and supply chain meet finance, customs duty, taxation and compliance. This is different than the usual supply chain use case, Ghosh said.  He told CoinDesk:  ""You hear that supply chains have been addressed by DLT – but have they? If you peel back the layers, these supply-chain implementations are simple track-and-trace. The value is missing.""  Where this value resides, in KPMG's view, is in customs and trade. Getting into detail, this concerns intra-company transactions involving different manufacturing components and revenue recognition around those transactions, which basically means the specific conditions in which revenues are accounted for under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  This also includes a complex array of value-added tax (VAT) and customs duties on these components depending on different jurisdictions and trade zones.  Stepping back, KPMG is progressing with previously announced financial services and trade finance blockchain initiatives, including a major asset management project with the Luxembourg Stock Exchange scheduled to go live in January 2019.  Yet its new blockchain leadership team under Ghosh leans toward tax and audit applications with David Jarczyk, KPMG U.S. blockchain tax leader, and Erich Braun, KPMG U.S. blockchain audit leader.  That helps explain the new focus. Rather like other digitally forlorn areas within global trade, cross-border manufacturing transactions and tariffs are today accounted for using a mishmash of shop floor systems, shipping and receiving systems, and bills of lading, with much of the customs work being outsourced.  As a corporate tax consultant to many large companies and conglomerates, KPMG is well aware of the complexity and pain points around the movement of unfinished goods from one country to another country or jurisdiction for those to be either finished, integrated, or added to a broader bill of materials.  ""You have customs agents and customs brokerage that handle things for you. They use a third system, so the shared sense of truth or the universal ledger today is a very manual, intensive reconciliation exercise,"" said Ghosh. This is the case in ""aerospace, auto, any heavy engineering manufacturing industry,"" he said.  So Ghosh and his team have combined KPMG's enterprise efforts around testing and evaluating private and permissioned blockchains with its customs and duty expertise in this area.  ""Customs and trade and the ability to manage compliance of tariffs is a very hot issue these days,"" said Ghosh. ""Unique in my mind, we are taking the same type of advisory or tax work we have done for so long and now putting a blockchain lense to it, because we can and we should.""  Taxing complexity  To test the idea, KPMG started in the first half of 2018 looking at how blockchain could be applied in a simple parts provenance exercise for a particular aerospace component.  It was anything but simple, however, involving imports between three regions and at least 20 manufacturing sites, with thousands of components comprising the bill of materials for a particular aerospace part.  Ghosh said containing and managing all this on a blockchain is one thing, ""but designing the system so you can understand your VAT implications, your duty drawbacks etc is another thing altogether.""  Duty drawbacks, which are refunds of certain duties, internal and revenue taxes collected upon the importation of goods, can vary depending on whether a component was designed in a particular country (in a free trade zone, for example), which may mean tax credits can be applied for, even if it's made elsewhere.  Blockchains and the applications that run on top of them can cut through this complexity and automate the whole process, Ghosh said.  ""The tax component, or the customs and trade and the duty drawbacks component, all become smart contracts that reside on the blockchain, which is now giving you the immutable ledger for the parts and the parts that are either having finished components that are taxable or not,"" he said.  Using a blockchain (KPMG is using Hyperledger Fabric) also makes it simple to show a regulator where a part or component may have gotten integrated with a bill of materials, which is now not taxable because of a free trade zone, for example.  Looking ahead, Ghosh said that in addition to traditional industrial manufacturing (including aerospace, automotive and heavy machinery), the firm is also investigating the use of this type of customs blockchain in the high-tech vertical, where it could track the integration of servers to hard drives down to the chips.  Acknowledging the enterprise blockchain world's difficult transition from an overload of lab testing, and what he described as ""pilot-itis,"" Ghosh vowed that KPMG's customs work was no mere experiment, concluding:  ""It's important to distinguish this from a proof of concept or a small scale pilot; this is being designed for production grade.""

42401978,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3B6V,1539576008,"How a Left-for-Dead, $0.22 Crypto Asset Became a Lifeline for Activists","""It exists everywhere.""  That's how Athens-based crypto enthusiast named ""Sporos"" describes faircoin – a tiny, $0.22 asset that in terms of daily trading volume, is barely a glitch on global cryptocurrency exchanges. Although it's listed at number 1,134 on CoinMarketCap, faircoin users aren't phased by the market's disinterest.  Instead, they pride themselves on faircoin's utility – which they say serves as nothing less than a lifeline.  ""I haven't used a bank in eight years,"" Sporos told CoinDesk.  Sporos was speaking from the heart of Exarcheia, an anarchist stronghold in Athens, where he maintains a faircoin information center. One of several hundred similar stations around the world, the center is stocked with homemade products like soaps, honey, olive oils, teas and jewelry, all available for purchase in faircoin.  According to available data, there's an estimated 624 such centers worldwide, each part of what Sporos calls the ""faircoin ecosystem,"" which includes a transportation sharing app, an AirBnB alternative and even a faircoin-based, tax-free financial institution called Bank of the Commons.  Within this network, Sporos refers to himself as a ""node."" While typically referring to computers, in faircoin, a node is a human representative that forges links between local initiatives and the global faircoin community, also known as FairCoop.  And those that are part of this cooperative trade faircoin – even with its price on CoinMarketCap far lower – for a fixed €1.20. It's a strict peg that was decided on by an assembly of faircoin users in January.  But while the valuation has been reduced on public cryptocurrency exchanges, Sporos argues the underlying infrastructure remains resilient.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Even though if somebody looks at the market price and sees $0.22, and if you have €10,000 you can buy all the coins, and that's it, even though we have this very low price, our real economy is the people.""  Abandoned project  Speaking to CoinDesk, Sporos described faircoin as ""totally the opposite"" of all other cryptocurrencies.  ""Aside from the blockchain, which is the same technology, the rest, why it is there, the people who use it, the past and the future of it, is totally the opposite,"" Sporos said.  Created in 2014, faircoin didn't originate from its current community. Rather, the cryptocurrency was discovered online by anti-capitalist activist Enric Duran, having been abandoned by its original creator (who allegedly created it as a pump-and-dump scheme).  ""Faircoin was just another coin somebody made,"" Sporos told CoinDesk. ""Some friends found this abandoned project, they liked the name, they bought the coins from here and there with their money, they acquired 50 million out of 52 million.""  A legendary activist, Duran is known for robbing nearly half a million euros in loans from Spanish banks in 2008, before founding a post-capitalist collective, the Catalan Integral Cooperative (CIC).  ""What they wanted to do was use the legal system and find bureaucratic loopholes to create their own internal economy and structure outside of the state, where people can satisfy their basic needs,"" bitcoin developer and early faircoin technical advisor, Amir Taaki, told CoinDesk.  From his site in the CIC, Duran organized the fledging faircoin community into an international body, named FairCoop, that seeks collaborations with groups that share similar ideas.  At the time of writing, ""nearly one thousand freelancers, cooperatives, worker-run businesses and small companies accept faircoin for their work and services,"" that serve up to ""15,000 users in total,"" Duran and a faircoin developer that wished to remain anonymous told CoinDesk in a joint statement.  Simply providing ""tools for political disobedience,"" Sporos said that faircoin often works in tandem with other local currency efforts, providing economic tools for communities to differentiate themselves from state forces.  ""Faircoin doesn't have an objective. Whoever uses it has an objective,"" Sporos said. ""It's not a community, it's many communities, collectives, cooperatives, individuals, even people who use it not based on ideology, but just as a tool.""  He continued:  ""It's just a tool, just a tool to avoid taxes, states, banks, whoever is monitoring your private life.""  A trust-based system  Consisting of small, community-oriented efforts internationally, faircoin is distinguished from other cryptocurrencies by its emphasis on trust, which is a defining security characteristic of its blockchain.  ""We as faircoin advocates believe that human trust networked relations and decentralized technologies as the blockchain can and should be combined,"" Duran and the anonymous developer continued.  Initially built on proof-of-stake, faircoin switched to a new way to protect its cryptocurrency in 2017, named ""proof-of-cooperation."" Designed by faircoin core developer Thomas König, proof-of-cooperation is an ultra light-weight consensus mechanism that runs on a set of 19 raspberry pies.  ""The whole system runs on 60 watts, so two light bulbs,"" Sporos told CoinDesk.  Seeking to disable the competitive nature of bitcoin mining, proof-of-cooperation requires that all 19 of these nodes must collaborate in order to validate a block – a task for which they're paid for in transaction fees. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, at a mere 19 block-producing nodes, the underlying group responsible for keeping the network moving are less broadly distributed.  And that's because, in order to become one of these nodes, faircoin deploys a social vetting process – intended to protect its economy from bad actors, like hackers or speculators.  The underlying block creators – comprised of what is known as a ""cooperatively validated node"" – must be approved by the FairCoop assembly, a network of roughly 280 faircoin users responsible for making decisions, to ensure their ideological commitment to the project.  For some, this means faircoin is vulnerable to centralization affects, such as censorship resistance, but according to Duran, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are just as centralized, due to the relatively few companies that can participate in the mining process.  Plus, the developers emphasized that while block creation is essentially a federated process, anyone can run a full node to verify transactions are accurate.  But the trusted, human element underpinning the blockchain doesn't stop there. For example, as well as agreeing on cooperatively validated nodes, the FairCoop assembly is responsible for making technical changes to the network, such as fees, block weight and other things, without requiring a system-wide upgrade, or hard fork.  Additionally, the majority of faircoin is held in a reserve that is managed by a small set of key holders. These key holders, also called ""nodes,"" are responsible for distributing the cryptocurrency to ""small, dense communities"" that use faircoin within their own local economies.  Social challenges  As such, there's a high degree of social coordination that underpins the faircoin ecosystem, which Sporos described as ""extremely challenging"" given the diverse groups present within the international body.  ""Human governance of things can be weak, complicated, can be conflicting, can be human,"" he told CoinDesk.  For example, while faircoin seeks to maintain a stable exchange rate to protect against speculation, the cryptocurrency got swept up in the rising market prices last year, leading to a community decision to increase its valuation from €1.00 to €1.20.  Since then, the markets have plummeted, leading to the miscorrelation between its market price and local trade. As a result, the faircoin reserve has insufficient liquidity to properly manage the ecosystem, leading to a poor distribution of wealth among the networks of faircoin users.  The exact figures of the reserve aren't discussed within the faircoin community (a source told CoinDesk that ""no one can know"" its contents, for fear the knowledge would be corrupting). But speaking to CoinDesk, faircoin enthusiast Matthew Slater described it as ""critically low.""  ""Faircoin's stability is designed to remove market risk, but in the case of a crash it's the reserve that takes the hit,"" Slater said.  While the fixed price was originally increased due to rising markets – the cryptocurrency was officially priced at a mere €0.05 for a number of years – Sporos told CoinDesk that while it's okay to increase the exchange rate ""you cannot go back.""  ""Everything will crumble down. It's not economically rational. Exactly because you are committed to acknowledge the official price. That's why you cannot go back,"" he said.  Slater, an economist theorist, took a similar stance, citing ""psychological reasons"" for not bringing down the exchange rate.  ""It's governed by people that don't fully understand the market characteristics,"" Slater contended, adding: ""There's an attempt to create an alternative economy but it cannot fully disengage from capitalism.""  Additionally, the small set of nodes that underlies the blockchain comes with its own problematics. For example, the majority of nodes need to be online constantly in order for the blockchain function – so if less than a third drop off grid, faircoin will stop processing transactions.  But according to Sporos, while the social coordination is at times highly challenging, it's precisely this grounding in the human condition that gives faircoin its strength.  ""Tomorrow if an electromagnetic storm wipes out the worlds hard disks, the guys who have bitcoins will not have any wealth the next day,"" Sporos said, concluding:  ""Even in the super crash, we just turn off the fucking blockchain nodes and use our telephones. 'Hey brother, hey comrade, hey compañero.' That's what we do. So this is the real economy, the real wealth, it's relations and trust.""
