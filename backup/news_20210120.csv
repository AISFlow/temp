42405729,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAemdBD,1611184512,'Let's Not Be Bitcoin': Yearn Finance Considers Minting $200M in New YFI Tokens,"Bitcoin may be the original cryptocurrency, but that doesn't mean leading decentralized finance (DeFi) projects aren't feeling self-confident enough to distinguish themselves from Satoshi's vision.      ""Let’s not be Bitcoin. This idea of hard caps for start-ups is very romantic but not necessarily the best execution path for maximal value,"" a participant in Yearn's governance forums, yfi_lit, wrote on Jan. 13.      Yfi_lit wrote this in defense of his now-modest proposal to mint a fresh new cache of 1,000 YFI tokens (currently priced at over $30,000), the same token that made the portal to DeFi, Yearn Finance, famous last summer, when 100% of its supply was given to Ethereum users with assets staked in key Yearn Finance vaults.      But the newest proposal has evolved. Now the Yearn community is gauging sentiment for increasing the supply by 22%, of a minting of 6,666 additional YFI (worth something like $200 million, at current prices), a third of which would go to core contributors and the rest would go to the treasury.      The proposal, authored by 11 different people, views ""the fair launch as a living concept rather than a single event,"" they write.      If sentiment looks good, it will be written up as code and voted on-chain using the governance app, Snapshot.      Not everyone is happy about the new developments, of course. Evoking themes like immutability and fixed monetary policy familiar to many longtime crypto enthusiasts, at least two YFI holders announced on the forum that they could no longer participate in a protocol that wasn't honoring its understood social contract.      ""I have observed the inability for the YFI project to detach itself from lord and saviour Andre [Cronje] and find its own path,"" captainobvious wrote under yfi_lit's post, announcing he's leaving.      When another user chimed in with the same decision, yfi_lit replied, ""Sorry for you to leave, but glad that people with that sort of attitude towards our builders are gone.""    Social contract    And it's not entirely unfair that some would see a kind of contract. Last year, Cronje put up a proposal himself to never mint any more YFI and it seemed to pass.      Over 90% of tokens voting supported it, but less than 15% of the token supply took part.      But the vote was never acted on. This is a controversial point in the community, but the current argument is that the only vote was a first phase or sentiment-gathering vote. Users never did the follow-up vote on actual code, so it didn't actually count.      ""What we had in September was a classic case of misalignment between stakeholders in the YFI community,"" Spencer Noon, now of Variant Fund, told CoinDesk. ""Burning the keys would have likely caused the price of YFI to appreciate in the short run, but potentially at the expense of the project's long-term sustainability.""      Yearn's governance processes have become more formalized since those early days, but the confusion around this decision persists.      It appears Cronje has had second thoughts.      On Jan. 12, he wrote again on Medium about why building in DeFi sucks. ""Don’t give away your tokens,"" Cronje wrote. ""I still have all the responsibility and expectation, except I have 0 of the reward or upside. Don’t do this, I was an idiot.""      Cronje, it should be noted, is famous for expressing his frustrations without being entirely committed to actions he espoused in a heated moment. He has also always had his eyes on the door, and may ultimately view a compensation scheme as something that would tie him down.      That said, Yearn isn't just Cronje now. As its team and ambitions grow it continues to look more and more like the protocol that will gobble all of DeFi.      Its existing base of supporters doesn’t want to risk losing the talent that has gotten the platform this far; by and large, it appears that the token supply will expand fairly soon.      ""Bitcoin has the same mindset, and they’re getting blown out of the water by Ethereum because of it,"" yfi_lit contended.      DeFi is building its own set of OGs and they seem to be largely circling their wagons around this move. Mariano Conti, the former chief of oracles at MakerDAO and current member of Yearn's multisig (the closest the protocol has to a board of directors), told CoinDesk over Telegram:    ""I'm very much in favor. YFI was the first 'fair launch' experiment, and my conclusion is that in the end this model didn't align properly with an ecosystem of developers and strategy writers, which is the lifeblood of a yield aggregator like Yearn.""  Oh BABY    Last September, Joel Monegro of Placeholder wrote a blog post urging communities to consider a ""buyback-and-make"" approach to using platform profits, rather than ""buyback-and-burn.""      Taking this to heart, the Yearn community moved forward a Yearn Improvement Proposal called Buyback and Build Yearn, or BABY. It passed with 99% support but less than 10% of YFI voting.      BABY would use profits from Yearn to buy YFI on the open market and use it for contributor rewards and other Yearn initiatives (see its third quarter 2020 financial report). Previously, most of the revenue was distributed to YFI holders who staked for governance, but the returns for doing so were fairly low.      Yearn is currently earning around $100,000 per week in fees, and community member Ryan Watkins contended that this could be better reinvested in Yearn itself.      ""Yearn has proven its ability to provide real value to YFI holders, distributing protocol revenue as dividends is a suboptimal capital allocation strategy given Yearn’s stage of maturity,"" Watkins wrote in October.      However, the sense of the community seems to be that BABY itself is not sufficient to hold onto the core team.      The new proposal suggests BABY will only be able to buy 100-300 YFI per year. Despite the fact that Yearn is rapidly expanding and launching a new version soon, ""earnings will likely not be enough to accumulate a sufficient amount of YFI for the Treasury,"" the proposal authors contend.      If the 6,666 tokens are minted, a compensation committee will take charge of negotiating deals with specific contributors around their ""retention package.""      ""In my opinion, this is yet another example of YFI having one of the most robust and prudent communities in all of DeFi,"" Noon wrote.      Before a proposal can go to an on-chain vote using Snapshot, it has to run for three days in conversation on the forums. It currently has 133 votes, roughly 75% in support of minting more YFI.      Though some have already begun to doubt the process. ""At the end of the day, the devs are going to do what they think is best regardless of community opinion,"" Dankmonty wrote as the conversation began. ""So just let us know. No need for all this drama.""",NEUTRAL,YFI,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | YFI,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/01/20/lets-not-be-bitcoin-yearn-finance-considers-minting-200m-in-new-yfi-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/34c2bb56bc13210d83726a7182f8c38bef8f7fbd-1500x1067.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385705,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB91Y1,1611178702,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Drops Briefly Below $33.5K While Ether Calls Dominate Options,"Bitcoin is recovering from a steady price decline while ether options traders anticipate another high-water mark after it hit an all-time high of $1,439.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $35,023 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 4.1% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $33,430-$36,794 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC above the 10-hour but way below the 50-hour moving averages on the hourly chart, a sideways signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price fell Wednesday, going as low as $33,430 around 15:00 UTC (10 a.m. ET), according to CoinDesk 20 data. It’s been a long and mostly downward direction for the price. The world’s oldest cryptocurrency was at a high of $36,794 just 24 hours ago. It fell over $3,300 before picking up somewhat, at $35,023 as of press time.      Constantin Kogan, partner at crypto investment firm Wave Financial, has a bearish outlook, anticipating a fall to at least $30,000. “This is where the bulls will begin to actively buy back. If we pass this mark it might drop to almost $26,000,” he told CoinDesk. “According to a Bank of America survey, long bitcoin has become the busiest type of trade.”      Read More: Bitcoin Most-Crowded Trade After Passing ‘Long Tech’: Bank of America      Kogan dubbed Wednesday’s crypto spill “a small squeeze.” A squeeze in the derivatives market certainly occurred over the past 24 hours. Jan. 19’s long liquidations, which included early Asian hours trading leading into Wednesday’s market, totaled $121 million. “Liquidations” is the equivalent of a margin call in crypto whereby a leveraged trader’s position gets wiped out.      On Jan. 10, the last time a large number of long liquidations occurred, $555 million in bull-placed leveraged trades were called in and the bitcoin market crumbled to $30,300.      However, Michael Stark, a market analyst at FX broker Exness, expects larger financial players to continue to plow dollars into the bitcoin market as investors continue avoid “risk-off” assets like gold and look into “risk-on” instruments like equities and crypto.      “Bitcoin will almost certainly continue upward eventually, but everything needs to pause here and there,” Stark said.      Read More: BlackRock Give 2 Funds Go-Ahead to Invest in Bitcoin Futures      With a new U.S. president, inaugurated Wednesday, bringing a new set of policies – including an expectation of more fiscal stimulus – traders may be getting optimistic that more dollars flooding into the economy might bring about higher crypto prices. The bitcoin market overall is still in bull mode; less than a month ago, the spot price per 1 BTC was below $25,000.      However, nothing is certain, notes Joshua Mahony, a senior market analyst at trading platform IG. The question for markets now is whether the U.S. Congress remains divided politically, ""with Biden hoping that Democrats will vote along party lines to help him push through a raft of grandiose spending packages,“ Mahony said.    Options traders like calls on ether    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was down Wednesday, trading around $1,338 and falling 3.8% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Read More: Ether’s Record Highs May Propel Cryptocurrency to $10.5K: Fundstrat      Ether’s price also declined Wednesday, though not by as much as bitcoin's. In fact, current-day options orientation in the ether market heavily favors calls, according to Skew. Call options are the right, but not obligation, to buy an asset at a set price and time. Calls are currently dominating those options, 66% versus 34% for puts, which are contracts giving the right, but not the obligation, to sell.      Wave Financial’s Kogan, although bearish on bitcoin for now, expects more bullish results out of ether in the near term. It appears options traders agree, given the way they are positioned. “The expected rollback of ether did not follow bitcoin, which indicates the strength of ETH’s trend,” Kogan said. “We are waiting for a pullback to $1,300 (but) in a couple of days, the growth will resume and very soon we might see the $1,800 mark.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are almost all red Wednesday Notable winners as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET):    algorand (ALGO) + 0.44%  chainlink (LINK) + 0.10%    Notable losers:    litecoin (LTC) - 7%  bitcoin cash (BCH) - 5.3%  cosmos (ATOM) - 5.3%    Equities:    Asia’s Nikkei 225 index ended the day in the red by 0.38% as investors took profits amid incoming U.S. Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen’s comments about more spending.

42385701,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB91Rj,1611178579,Tether Use on Tron Passes Ethereum as Low Fees Attract Small Transactions,"The number of tether transactions on the Tron blockchain have passed Ethereum’s count for three consecutive weeks as fees on the number two blockchain remain high.      Total weekly tether transactions on Ethereum have held steady at around 1.5 million for the past four weeks. But on Tron, transactions per week have grown from roughly 900,000 in mid December to nearly 2 million the second week in January, per Coin Metrics data.      This recent trend is “primarily because of fees,” said Coin Metrics analyst Nate Maddrey in a message to CoinDesk.      Priced in dollars, the average fee for an Ethereum transaction set a record high of above $19 a week ago, but now sits just below $8. Priced in ether, the average fee is well below all-time highs but still rather large, surpassing 0.015 ETH multiple times this month, per data from Blockchair.      “As fees go up, [tether] transactions tend to shift from Ethereum to Tron,” Maddrey said.      Notably, the total value of tether transacted on Ethereum is still larger than Tron, signaling that primarily smaller transactors are migrating. Meanwhile, parties executing larger transactions who can presumably afford higher fees seem comfortable continuing to use Ethereum.      “Lately, given the increased cost of Ethereum transactions, it would be logical to use Tron,” said Tether CTO Paolo Ardoino, noting the newer blockchain also has “good adoption across crypto exchanges” and is “extremely cheap compared to Ethereum.”      Tron isn’t the only alternative for tether users. In the past two years, Tether has also launched on Algorand, Solana and Liquid Network with plans for even more integrations, Ardoino said. But which network claims the largest share of Tether transactions is still somewhat of an open question.      Tether transactions skewing heavily toward just one or two blockchains wouldn’t be surprising, Maddrey told CoinDesk. But the distribution of use depends on “a combination of low fees, network effects, and usability.”      Ardoino told CoinDesk that in a few years he expects Ethereum to still “retain an important role for Tether thanks to the Ethereum 2.0 migration that should guarantee more throughput.”      He also expects other blockchains to “get a fair share of the total throughput,” however.",POSITIVE,ETH,ALGO | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SOL | USDT,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/20/tether-use-on-tron-passes-ethereum-as-low-fees-attract-small-transactions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dc5492904da2fad4f44fc4dfc2b900747fb049ca-1082x710.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385704,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB91VV,1611170626,"Bitcoin Sells Off on Bearish Sentiment, Yellen Worries","Bitcoin’s price slumped by around 5.6% in the past 24 hours thanks to some Asian traders taking a short-term bearish view and concerns the new Biden administration in the U.S. will seek to put a damper on cryptocurrency use.      Profit-taking occurred in the spot market during Asian market hours after bitcoin failed to consolidate around the record high of $40,000 in the past week. In the derivatives markets, short positions grew, led by institutions and large bitcoin holders known as whales.      Data from Skew shows bitcoin's perpetual swaps funding on major derivatives exchanges, a proxy for the cost of maintaining a long position in the derivatives market, dropped today, an implication that the demand for oriented trades has decreased.      At press time, bitcoin traded at $35,008.58, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      The sell-off also led to major corrections for other cryptocurrencies on the CoinDesk 20, including ether, stellar, xrp and chainlink.      Despite some long-term positive view that bitcoin’s price could reach as high as $100,000, analysts and traders told CoinDesk that large bitcoin holders have become more bearish in the short term, especially after ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap reached a new all-time high on Tuesday.      “The sentiment in Asia at least has been very bearish in the short term, after they saw the retail side is getting too bullish, ” Alex Zuo, vice president of China-based crypto wallet Cobo, told CoinDesk. He said the recent price surge in alternative cryptocurrencies reflects increased interest from retail investors, who usually tend to react to price volatility more significantly.      As a result, institutions and bitcoin whales are less inclined to put fresh capital into the market. Zuo said. Instead, they are either taking profits by selling on the spot market or executing arbitrate trades by shorting the spot market.      Data from on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant also indicates there is selling pressure on the spot market. The whale ratio on exchanges, which measures the relative size of the top 10 inflows to total inflows for all exchanges, has gone up since last week to above 0.85, meaning that more large bitcoin holders are depositing bitcoin on exchanges. That is considered a sell signal because it could mean large holders of bitcoin are looking to unload their inventory to the market.      What’s keeping prices from falling drastically, according to CryptoQuant’s company’s chief executive, is the unloaded bitcoins are being snapped up by buyers on one particular exchange.      “If we wouldn’t see any significant buying pressure from Coinbase Pro, I think bitcoin would be bearish,” Ki Young Ju, CryptoQuant’s CEO said in a tweet.      Ki told CoinDesk one indicator to watch is bitcoin outflow from Coinbase, usually a metric that implies an institution’s bitcoin purchase via over-the-counter desks. Once significant bitcoin outflows from Coinbase take place, bitcoin’s price could recover and even go up as high as $100,000, he said.      In the derivative market, the at-the-money implied volatility has dropped sharply since it peaked earlier this month, according to data site Skew. The indicator shows investors’ expectation of how turbulent prices will be over the next month; a drop usually leads to a cheap cost on options contracts.      “Bitcoin put buying over the last several days is finally taking its toll on the market, while at-the-money implied volatility has dropped significantly since peaking earlier in the month,” Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the London-based prime brokerage Bequant, said. “However, call selling has been the dominant play today and there is still a huge amount of open interest in end of the month contracts at the $52,000 mark, which should ease any concerns the bulls may have.”      The declining premium of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust versus its net asset value is another negative sign indicating more selling pressure than buying, Cobo’s Zuo added. The premium dropped to 8.66% on Tuesday from a December high at 40.18%. Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group (DCG), which also owns CoinDesk.      Another possible cause for the decline is U.S. Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen, who made negative comments about bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies during her confirmation hearing on Tuesday.      During the hearing, Yellen suggested President Joe Biden’s administration could look at how to curtail the use of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in financing criminal activity, including terrorism.      Read More: Janet Yellen Says Cryptocurrencies Are a ‘Concern’ in Terrorist Financing      “There is no doubt that the incoming [Biden’s] regime will focus on consumer protection more than the previous one, which means more enforcement actions, tightening rules and aspiring for greater control over the markets,” Guy Hirsch, managing director for U.S. at eToro, said. “If the regulators take an aggressive stance against bitcoin, we could enter a prolonged bearish run.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/20/bitcoin-sells-off-on-bearish-sentiment-yellen-worries,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b440dc5d4e4b70eefc05f292624d29cb66b8aee0-1200x624.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42385699,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB91Nx,1611170105,"The Relationship Between US Government Debt and Bitcoin, Explained","The kind of inflation outbreak that might prove bitcoin’s power as a hedge asset isn’t coming in the near term, according to some economists.      “Right now, low interest rates tell us there’s no evidence that we’re borrowing too much money,” Stanford economist Erik Brynjolfsson said. “Separately, but related, inflation is also very low. The [Federal Reserve] has set a target of about 2% for inflation, and it’s consistently been missing that target on the low side. We don’t see any evidence that inflation is taking off.""      In fact, future economic growth could be in danger if the U.S. doesn’t embrace new stimulus, former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told CoinDesk. He said the potential for inflation isn’t as concerning as the potential for economic growth coming to a halt.      “I think the greater risks are still on the side of secular stagnation and low interest rates,” Summers said. “There may be some temporary sense of heat in the economy because of all the stimulus that's been provided in the last year.”      Bitcoiners are closely watching inflation indicators such as the U.S. Treasury yield curve steepening in early January, which shows that investors expect economic growth that will require the Federal Reserve to raise rates to control inflation. The five-year breakeven rate, which represents how the bond market foresees long-term inflation, has been above 2% since the beginning of the year.      These indicators point to future rising inflation, but “we’re not seeing it yet,” Brynjolfsson said.      “It’s possible, even likely, that government policy over the coming year will change that and start bringing interest rates back up,” Brynjolfsson said. “The Fed may monetize some of that [debt] by printing money.”      Right now, the markets are screaming for more debt.      “Supply and demand dictate that when there are more savers than borrowers, then [real] interest rates are going to fall to zero or even negative,” Brynjolfsson said, commenting on a discussion paper by Summers and Harvard economist Jason Furman. “The markets are willing to buy government assets and if the government were to issue more debt it would be snapped up very quickly.""    Read more: Why Joe Biden’s $3T Stimulus Package Could Add Fuel to Bitcoin’s Rally    Savings have increased significantly during the pandemic while the supply of investment capital has decreased, Summers said. As a result, real interest rates on servicing government debt are negative and likely to remain that way in the near term, which means the government would make money off of borrowing more. (The real interest rate is the interest rate when inflation is taken into account.)      With little room for central banks to lower rates and a clear runway to borrow more, many advanced economies are turning to fiscal policy to stave off the continuing crisis.      “If you look around the world, there’s a shortage of demand in lots of large advanced-economy countries ... [that] began this crisis at deeply negative interest rates and have had little policy space with interest rates,” U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said during an event hosted by Princeton University last Thursday. “That all is going to hang around for a while.”      When vaccines create a world that can spend freely again, that may still not produce the high inflation that bitcoiners would be looking for as an affirmation of BTC’s “inflation hedge” thesis.      “As the pandemic recedes and we see a potentially strong wave of spending as people return to their normal lives and begin consuming various services, there could be quite exuberant spending and we could see some upward pressure on prices,” Powell said. “The real question is how large is that effect going to be and will it be persistent? Because clearly a one-time increase in prices that isn’t very large is very unlikely to produce persistently high inflation.”    Read more: Crypto Long & Short: Bitcoin Is More Than a Hedge Against Inflation – It’s a Hedge Against ‘Crazy’    In the near term, bitcoin will still profit from a low interest rate environment even if inflation doesn’t skyrocket. The less money investors can make on bond yields, the more money they might instead put into potentially higher-returning assets like bitcoin, Summers said.      “It's a fairly straightforward argument,” Summers said. “When the amount you can earn on bonds goes down, people put less of their money into bonds and more of their money into other assets, and that increases the value of those assets.”    See also: Why Bitcoin Is Bigger Than an Inflation Hedge, feat. Dan Tapiero    Brynjolfsson added: “The demand for assets like U.S. Treasurys, gold and bitcoin has dramatically exceeded the supply, driving up prices.

Among other allegations, the report from J Capital called Bit Digital’s filings, which showed it operates nearly 23,000 bitcoin mining machines in China, “simply a lie.”      In December, Bit Digital announced a $13.9 million agreement to buy nearly 18,000 Whatsminer and Antminer ASICs. Whatsminer manufacturer MicroBT did not respond to a request for comment from CoinDesk.      J Capital also called Bit Digital a “sham bitcoin business,” claiming to have verified with local Chinese government officials that Bit Digital has “no bitcoin miners” there, casting doubt over the legitimacy of its Asia-based mining operations in China.      Bit Digital said all of its mainland China mining operations are managed by XMAX Hong Kong, and all “utility bills and other expenses” are paid to Hong Kong suppliers.      The company's stock soared over 400% between Dec. 28, 2020, to Jan. 4, 2021, peaking above $32 and pushing the company above a $1 billion market value. J Capital published its report one week later on Jan. 11. Since then, Bit Digital shares have dropped over 35% to around $16.      Bit Digital responded to none of CoinDesk’s emails seeking comment. CoinDesk was also unable to contact facility managers of Bit Digital’s Asia-based mining operations.      The company also mines in the U.S., however. In Texas and Nebraska, Bit Digital owns a total of 2,100 machines in facilities managed by Minnesota-based mining infrastructure company Compute North.      Compute North CEO Dave Perrill told CoinDesk his company has always had a “very healthy partnership” with Bit Digital, confirming the 2,000 machines in Nebraska and 100 in Texas that his company manages.      On a phone call, Perrill said his team is also “in talks about significantly scaling up operations” with Bit Digital. He said he could not speak to his client’s Asian mining facilities.

Prospectus documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Wednesday indicate that BlackRock Global Allocation Fund Inc. and BlackRock Funds V are at least eyeing bitcoin. They both include the world's oldest cryptocurrency on their lists of derivative products cleared for use.      BlackRock did not state which commodity exchange it will choose to execute these crypto futures buys. However, the funds may only invest in cash-settled bitcoin futures. CME is the only exchange registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that offers similar futures products at this time.      The filings warn that investments in these futures could carry illiquidity risks due to the ""relatively new"" market. Regulatory changes, volatility and valuation risks could similarly weigh on the price and thus ""adversely impact a Fund.""      The filings appear to mark BlackRock's entrance into the bitcoin market.      Before Wednesday, the investments giant has never so much as mentioned ""bitcoin"" in any of its regulatory filings. But that appears to be changing: ""Certain Funds may engage in futures contracts based on bitcoin,"" the prospectus documents state.      Last November, the company's CIO for fixed income, Rick Rieder, told CNBC that cryptocurrency may be ""here to stay,"" and could even replace gold ""to a large extent,"" noting that it was ""much more functional"" than the yellow metal.      CEO Larry Fink even acknowledged bitcoin's rising popularity, saying it had potential to turn into a global market asset last year.      The asset manager also recently posted a job opening for a blockchain and crypto executive, seeking a vice president of blockchain for its New York office.      Candidates for the position should be able to create valuation models for cryptocurrencies, but also evaluate governance models and other aspects of the underlying technology, the posting said.

(CoinDesk opinion)    Market intel    Wall of wallets With bitcoin in the red, shedding some $2,600 on Wednesday, traders are consolidating. The number of addresses holding at least 1,000 BTC, has risen from 2,407 to a new lifetime high of 2,438 in the past seven days, according to data source Glassnode. “It remains to be seen if persistent buying from large investors translates into a quick recovery,” CoinDesk markets report Omkar Godbole writes. “The odds, however, appear stacked against a notable price drop.    At stake    Toil and trouble? The question on everyone’s mind is whether this rally is sustainable. After a parabolic ascent that brought bitcoin above $40,000, a level more than double a previous all-time high set in 2017, the cryptocurrency has seemingly settled in a new normal around $35,000.      Daily trading has seen a level of volatility typical for digital assets, with 5% market moves common on the intraday charts. But it’s still an open question whether bitcoin will continue to set new highs above $40,000 in the near term.      JPMorgan analysts have cited a long-term bitcoin price target of over $146,000, based on a comparison to gold. While bears still think the decade-old crypto could collapse to $0. That’s quite a range of opinions!      In a recent survey of “market professionals,” Deutsche Bank found a whopping 87% think investments across asset classes are overheating. More than half think it's more likely for bitcoin to halve than double within the year. Though even more think the same of Tesla, one of 2020’s best performing bets.      It’s no secret that traditional and digital assets are on the ascent due to an unprecedented amount of U.S. dollars that have flowed into the financial system, as part of a coronavirus recovery plan. Money is cheaper than ever. Interest rates are nothing and approximately 23% of U.S. dollars in circulation were printed last year.      It’s for this reason that some keen observers think it’s not just bitcoin that’s in a bubble, but the entire financial system. Jeremy Grantham, co-founder of GMO, a major investment firm, said “this event will be recorded as one of the great bubbles of financial history,” in a letter to investors. He cited, “extreme overvaluation, explosive price increases, frenzied issuance and hysterically speculative investor behavior.”      Still, many crypto analysts think there’s something different about bitcoin. Driven by increasing institutional investments – from the likes of hedge funds and publicly-traded companies – the recent market cycle sets itself apart from the retail exuberance seen three years ago.      As CoinDesk’s Director of Research Noelle Acheson noted in a recent newsletter, “It could also be argued that bitcoin is the anti-bubble, that its price is going up because of bubbles elsewhere in the economy. Many investors are buying bitcoin in response to what they see as a massive sovereign bond bubble, which they believe the government will try to deflate by printing money.”      Acheson argues that the label “bubble” implies there’s a discrepancy between an asset’s price and underlying value. The question with bitcoin is determining its intrinsic value. That’s a tough proposition, considering bitcoin’s users are still working out what the cryptocurrency's use case is, she writes.      Over the past year, the belief in bitcoin as a hedge against inflation has steadily grown in popularity. Even if this idea is true, it wouldn’t undercut bitcoin’s usability as a payment tool to buck financial gatekeepers, or as a way for anyone to speculate on macro trends.      Bitcoin’s open system is non-discriminatory. It can be whatever you want it to be. As Bloomberg journalist Tracy Alloway put it, “[T]here will always be a fresh bull case for Bitcoin waiting in the wings. In that sense, it's really the perfect post-modern financial asset for a post-modern financialized economy.”      So is bitcoin in a bubble? Well, it depends on what you mean by bubbles and what you mean by bitcoin.

42385696,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB91LR,1611165448,"Dear Crypto Derivatives Industry, Let's Not Repeat 2008","$1 quadrillion. The derivatives market is considered the biggest market in the world on a notional basis, eclipsing even the ballooning world debt market by four times. However, on a gross market value basis, the derivatives market is considered significantly smaller. The Bank of International Settlements (BIS) estimated it at approximately $12 trillion last year.      The lack of clarity over the size of the derivatives market points to its opaqueness, with little improved real-time risk transparency since the financial crisis of 2008-09. In a famous investor letter from 2002, Warren Buffett referred to derivatives as “weapons of financial mass destruction” (not mentioning that Berkshire Hathaway has used stock options, a derivative instrument).    Sandra Ro is a former derivatives banker and market infrastructure executive and the CEO of the Global Blockchain Business Council, a Swiss industry non-profit building the next multitrillion-dollar industry through partnership, education and advocacy.    The global derivatives market is one of the most influential areas of financial services because it often drives the underlying prices of other asset classes, and because it is very lucrative. Derivatives are also considered the “black box” of the financial services world, especially over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, because so few understand them. (Many crypto markets are open books by comparison.)      Most OTC derivative transactions are private and bilateral. Therefore, knowing the actual risk exposures and positions across global derivative portfolios at any given time requires enormous systemic risk management and monitoring. Listed or publicly traded futures and options contracts have more data available for public consumption. However, I would argue they are still difficult to risk manage because most contracts sit across hundreds if not thousands of different exchanges, trading venues, brokers, sell-side and buy-side, in data silos.      See also: UK’s Ban on Crypto Derivatives Goes Into Effect Today      Derivatives, at their core, offer hedging and risk management solutions for those exposed to the corresponding asset, whether in the form of hedging against adverse price movements or too much volatility of prices. American farmers started locking in prices of sugar and wheat more than 100 years ago as a form of protection against lower prices in the future (aka ""futures"" markets).      However, in the years since, derivatives have attracted speculation and leveraged trading, which can spell disaster if regulatory guardrails are not clear and enforced. In the 2000s, “Mrs. Watanabe” investors (a term coined for normally cautious Japanese housewives) became involved with infamous Japanese yen (JPY) carry trades: moving JPY markets globally, befuddling FX traders in London and New York and wiping out the life savings of some Japanese families.    Why crypto markets should care    The crypto markets are growing and maturing, which means, inevitably, more crypto derivative products will be available in the market for institutional and retail investors to trade. Crypto derivative product developers, regulators, brokers, dealers, traders and exchanges should learn from the mistakes of traditional capital markets, specifically the opacity of these markets, and build better ways to risk manage exposures, leverage in the form of margin trading and foster growth in this potentially lucrative market while also protecting retail investors and keeping out or mitigating damage from bad actors.      Furthermore, with the tokenization of potentially everything and anything, we could see real innovation and breakthroughs for the green economy from green bonds to carbon credits to climate change indices.      In recent months, we have seen regulators take a closer look at crypto derivatives, outright banning the retail marketing of them in the U.K., for example. We also see U.S. regulators turning to enforcement actions against companies like BitMEX, which has been offering derivative products on its platform for years.      It is still very early days of crypto derivatives. What do we need to do now?      See also: Crypto Long & Short: A UK Ban on Crypto Derivatives Will Hurt, Not Protect, Investors      There are regulated crypto derivative instruments currently trading like CME’s bitcoin futures, options on futures and the recently launched exchange-traded note (ETN) from Van Eck/Deutsche Boerse. However, product creation is only one part of the puzzle. The crypto derivatives community needs to create real-time risk mitigation and management tools for regulators, industry professionals and, ultimately, help all of us all build more resilient derivatives markets ahead of the next financial crisis.      There will be another financial crisis. The question is, will the crypto derivatives market create it, fuel it, or help mitigate the negative fallout?      In 2021, the industry should step up engagement with legislators and regulators on the topic of derivatives, margin trading, and real-time reporting. It is, when, not if, more crypto derivative products and services will come onto the market. We have seen a notable uptick in interest and inquiries from a variety of stakeholders, including governments and the private sector. The decentralized finance (DeFi) community as well as leading fintechs are developing a lot of creative solutions around real-time settlement, mitigating counterparty risk (aka atomic swaps) and reduction of margin and/or collateral with perpetual futures and other innovative solutions. However, there is a double-edged sword of accountability when things go wrong. Who is accountable? And where does one go, if maligned, and there are financial losses?      Work has begun; we invite all those interested, as well as those working on initiatives to reach out and communicate. The Global Blockchain Business Council (GBBC) is ramping up discussions on a blueprint for crypto derivative standards review and engagement (similar to, and likely needing collaboration with International Swaps and Derivatives Association), mapping of existing products, regulatory and legal frameworks and guidance specific to derivative markets (in discussions with the GBBC’s Global Standards Mapping Initiative to create a derivatives working group), and initial discussions with regulators on how to create digital infrastructure which can deliver better monitoring of real-time risk reporting and overall risk mitigation.      At the end of the day, regulators, central bankers, and governments want to ensure financial stability and consumer protections while allowing for innovation and entrepreneurship in these very segments. The crypto derivatives industry can help shape the building of a better, more resilient, and transparent pathway to global liquidity and financial stability by designing real-time risk management solutions, fostering the growth of innovative grassroots solutions via the DeFi community AND working with regulators to build guardrails that prevent the next financial meltdown.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Sandra Ro,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/01/20/dear-crypto-derivatives-industry-lets-not-repeat-2008,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0087a75bb844feb4e3b2c614b9715158738a85ed-2560x2279.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

San Francisco-based Cere is taking a fresh approach to the slow-moving world of big business blockchain, which usually involves retrofitting some private but shared ledger among a group of banks or logistics companies.      Cere is described as being “aligned” with Polkadot, the public blockchain interoperability protocol built by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood. In fact, Cere has built its own layer one blockchain network that is similar and compatible with Polkadot, explained Cere Network CEO Fred Jin.      “Because it’s built on top of Substrate (the same modular blockchain code framework on which Polkadot is built), Cere can facilitate cross-chain asset transfers and interoperability with most of the other Polkadot/Substrate projects, as well as other public networks such as Ethereum soon,” Jin told CoinDesk via email.      As such, Cere’s goal of shaking up customer relationship management (CRM) software is closer to some Ethereum-based initiatives that are also looking to combine private versions of the tech with the public mainnet, such as the Baseline Protocol.      “Cere is more focused on consumer enterprise uses cases that can really benefit from blockchain technology, such as identity/privacy, micro-payment/derivative assets,” said Jin.      Jin said Cere’s hub-and-spoke model allows for existing enterprise chains such as Hyperledger (the Linux-affiliated DLT greenhouse that includes Fabric, IBM’s preferred blockchain protocol) to be linked to Cere and data to be connected from these chains with the wider Polkadot ecosystem.      “A partnership between IBM and Cere would therefore be a possibility in the future,” Jin added.      Cere has raised $5 million in investment since August 2019 to build out decentralized CRM tools, and since then has signed several Fortune 1000 companies as clients, Cere said.

42385698,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB91Mh,1611152874,Privacy Coin Firo in Midst of 'Hash War' With 51% Attacker,"Firo (formerly known as Zcoin) has experienced a 51% attack and is now in the throes of a hash war. Firo recommends users not make transactions at this time, and said it is working with exchanges and pools to mitigate the damage. The team has also asked that all wallets and masternodes be upgraded with a newly released hot fix as soon as possible.      A 51% attack occurs when a miner (or miners) acquires more than 50% of the network's mining hash power and takes control of the network.      The Firo team first noticed the attack at 7 a.m. UTC, according to Firo Project Steward Reuben Yap. While the attack had ceased, it is now underway again as the attacker tries to move funds.      The Firo team implemented a block on the funds the attacker consolidated.      “Many of the pools have updated and are respecting it,” said Yap. “But the attacker is trying to get their own blocks in to make their own chain, as some of the ecosystem hasn't updated yet. The attacker is still trying to make their chain longer than ours. Once the ecosystem updates with the latest release, this problem will go away. For now, we are locking down the funds and attack vectors as we await further info from exchanges.”    Hash war    At the moment, from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) perspective, both chains are valid. Eventually, whoever has the most accumulated work, will become the chain of ""truth’,"" according to Yap.      The attacker is trying to move the funds, which includes transactions that move their ill-gotten gains. Other pools are trying to invalidate those transactions and keep them locked.    Read more: Privacy Coin Firo Launches ‘Privacy by Default’ Protocol on Mainnet    “So that’s why it’s a hash war,” said Yap. “The miner is mining their own chain and trying to overtake the legitimate chain.”    What happened    In an email, Yap told CoinDesk the attacker created a stealth chain that was mining secretly with a huge amount of hashrate.      “The hashrate doesn't appear to have been rented from the usual suspects, as Merkle Tree Proofs aren’t on NiceHash and there isn't sufficient hashrate on other sites to launch it,” said Yap. “Also, this chain was not broadcast so no one was aware of it.”      Firo implemented Merkle Tree Proofs on its network for egalitarian mining.      In the meantime, according to Yap, the attacker was selling huge amounts of FIRO on the market, causing a crash. Once that was done, they exposed their chain – which was longer. The longer chain invalidated the deposits they made, and the chain rolled back 300+ blocks.      The attacker did several deposits of their funds on Binance before consolidating the vast majority of the funds into a single address.      The Firo team then activated the Lelantus emergency switch to prevent the address from being anonymized, a function that was previously approved by the community.      “To be clear, this was not a Lelantus flaw or a code flaw,” said Yap. “It appears to be a pure 51% attack on a large scale. What was interesting is the pattern of a massive amount of purchases prior and a big price run-up, and then these dumps.”      Yap said his company is still investigating the motive behind the attack and is unsure if there is a correlation or if the funds used to do the double-spend attack were obtained during the run-up. To pull off a double-spend of this magnitude, the attacker would have had to have acquired significant amounts of FIRO legitimately.    Chainlocks on Firo    Firo was weeks away from deploying chainlocks, a secondary validation layer that would have secured its chain by using its masternodes to “checkpoint every block so that you get instant finality upon block confirmation,” said Yap.      Once the chainlocks are activated, the attacker would need more than 50% control of all masternodes on top of 51% of the mining hashrate. In addition to providing a secondary layer of protection, chainlocks will also drastically increase the costs of the attack.    Read more: Privacy Coin Advocates Persevere Amid Multiple Crypto Exchange Delistings    Chainlocks are already live on the Firo testnet.      “So the timing and the way the attacker worked are very suspicious and don’t seem to be entirely profit-oriented,” said Yap. “Especially when considering that MTP has been live on our chain for a long time and several months have passed since the first halving.”      The price of the privacy coin has dropped around 17% in the last 24 hours.

42385707,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB91ZH,1611152060,First Mover: What's Next for Ethereum After Cryptocurrency Hits All-Time High,"Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency, was down for a second straight day, pushing toward the lower end of the range between $34,000 and $40,000 where prices have traded for the past couple weeks.      Ether (ETH), the second-biggest cryptocurrency, retreated after surging on Tuesday to a new all-time high price of $1,439. (Our Market Moves column, below, looks at the significance of this milestone. See also the latest issue of CoinDesk's Valid Points newsletter by our colleagues Christine Kim and Will Foxley, exploring the ""intrinsic value of ether."")      The price pullback is ""somewhat disappointing, but also not entirely unexpected given the focus elsewhere, most notably the transition of power in the U.S.,"" said Denis Vinokourov, head of research for the cryptocurrency prime broker Bequant.      In traditional markets, European shares rose and U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher open ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's scheduled swearing-in on Wednesday in Washington at 12 p.m. Eastern time (17:00 UTC). Gold strengthened 0.5% to $1,848.78 an ounce.    Market moves    Just a month after bitcoin eclipsed its old all-time high from the bull run three years ago, prices for the lesser-known but more-versatile ether notched a new record on Tuesday: $1,439.33, based on CoinDesk pricing.      And just as bitcoin's rapid ascent has spurred a new wave of lofty price predictions, analysts and investors in digital-asset markets immediately set about speculating on what comes next for ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain.      ""Ethereum will soon pass to the next level,"" the trader and analyst Alex Kruger tweeted Tuesday. Points to watch range from $1,500 to $2,750, he added.      The run already looks pretty impressive. Prices climbed nearly sixfold last year and have surged another 90% just in the first few weeks of 2021.      Ether is the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market value, which is becoming increasingly significant in comparison to real-world analogues, including several big U.S. banks that sit at the hub of the traditional economy.      The price surge over the past few days has pushed the market value of all the existing ether in the world to about $160 billion. At that level, it's larger than the U.S. financial behemoths Wells Fargo ($135 billion) and Citigroup ($132 billion) as well as the 86-year-old Wall Street investment bank Morgan Stanley ($137 billion).      Bitcoin's market value is about $644 billion, for what it's worth.      The logical justification for comparing the value with banks is that the Ethereum blockchain is the primary venue for development of decentralized finance. DeFi is a subsector of the cryptocurrency industry where entrepreneurs are using open-source software to build semi-automated versions of lending and trading platforms atop blockchain networks. The theory is that they could someday replace or at least disrupt traditional financial firms.      The comparison isn't perfect because Ethereum works more like a network for companies and developers to build upon rather than the companies themselves. But the exercise does point to the ecosystem's no-longer-dismissable scale.      This is key for the value of ether because the cryptocurrency is often used as collateral within DeFi protocols as well as used to pay fees on transactions over the Ethereum blockchain.      Collateral socked into DeFi protcols has soared to almost $25 billion, from about $700 million at the start of 2020, and even Brian Brooks, who stepped down last week as acting U.S. comptroller of the currency, tweeted Tuesday that DeFi might be ""scary to some today but necessary tomorrow as some banks start telling you what you can and can't do with your own money.""      According to the industry tracker DappRadar, about 45% of 238 new decentralized applications in 2020 were designed to run on the Ethereum blockchain. The top 10 applications, known as dapps, were responsible for 87% of transaction volumes on the blockchain, DappRadar wrote in a recent report.      ""DeFi development has been progressing rapidly,"" the blockchain-analysis firm Coin Metrics wrote Tuesday. ""Although institutions likely aren’t wading into DeFi at this stage, there may be growing interest from traditional finance investors drawn in by the technology.""      The Ethereum ecosystem also has growing similarities with traditional fixed-income markets, especially now that the blockchain is transitioning toward a ""staking"" system, where new rules will reward investors with juicy yields for putting in the capital needed to assure network security. There's even a growing demand for bitcoin that's tokenized to make it compatible with the Ethereum network, where the tokens can then be deposited into DeFi protocols in exchange for attractive interest rates.      And just as bitcoin has benefited from a wave of big institutional investors allocating money to the asset, a raft of headlines on ether could draw fresh interest from professional managers.      Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, CEO of Binance, the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange, wrote this week in a quarterly report that bitcoin works like a gateway for investors getting into the digital-asset ecosystem: ""People enter via bitcoin and will almost certainly eventually explore other things in the crypto space,"" he wrote.      The Chicago-based futures exchange CME, which helped make cryptocurrencies more accessible to traditional investors when it launched bitcoin futures trading in late 2017, announced in December that it plans to start ether futures next month.      ""This will give a more extensive base of institutional investors access to ETH exposure,"" the Norwegian cryptocurrency analysis firm Arcane Research wrote Tuesday in a weekly note to clients.      There are risks, of course. Ether prices are even more volatile than those for the notoriously volatile bitcoin. And over the past year, as DeFi activity grew, the Ethereum network suffered from congestion and elevated transaction fees. Blockchain contenders have sprung up to challenge Ethereum, including Polkadot, Cardano and Binance Smart Chain, according to DappRadar.      Even so, Simon Peters, market analyst for the trading platform eToro, said Tuesday in emailed comments that he's impressed with the network's ability to host decentralized streaming applications, web browsers, video games, shared computing power services and digital art shops. In addition to DeFi.      “This plethora of uses has contributed to Ethereum’s price rise,"" Peters wrote. ""As more Dapps are built on the Ethereum blockchain, its utility increases.""      He said it's ""very feasible"" that ether could hit $2,500 this year, as it ""benefits from the extended cryptoasset bull run we are currently seeing.""      In that sense it's just like bitcoin: A key use case for ether is speculation.      - Bradley Keoun    Bitcoin watch    Investors' ongoing appetite for bitcoin wasn't enough to prevent the top cryptocurrency by market value from slipping by over $2,600 on Wednesday.      Bitcoin fell from $36,000 to $34,000 early Wednesday (coordinated universal time or UTC) and was last seen changing hands near $34,300, representing a 5% drop on the day, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      While the cryptocurrency is down, it’s still within a week-long narrowing price range, as seen on the hourly price chart.      A move below the lower end of the triangle would expose support at $30,000. The odds, however, appear stacked against a notable price drop, as bitcoin investors remain undeterred by the bull market’s pause and continue to boost their holdings. The number of addresses holding at least 1,000 BTC has risen from 2,407 to a new all-time high of 2,438 in the past seven days, according to the data provider Glassnode.      Meanwhile, the number of bitcoins locked up in accumulation addresses has gone up by 30,000 to 2,739,166 BTC in the past week. Accumulation addresses are those that have at least two incoming “non-dust” transfers and have never spent funds. Dust refers to insignificantly tiny amounts of the digital asset.      Lastly, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the biggest publicly traded crypto investment trust, purchased a total of 16,244 BTC ($607 million) on Monday, sucking out significantly more supply from the market than miners had added.

Other investors joining the round include Sino Global Capital, Kenetic Capital, Rockaway Blockchain Fund, Hack VC, DeFi Alliance and Avon Ventures, a venture capital fund affiliated with FMR LLC, the parent company of Fidelity Investments.      Announced Wednesday, Wintermute plans to use the funding to open its first international office in Singapore in the first quarter of this year, spearheading a general push into Asia, the company said.      The company also plans to launch a derivatives business and offer RFQ or “request-for-quote” services for counterparties, typically used for trading illiquid markets.      RFQ is basically an automated version of Wintermute’s over-the-counter trading business and something the firm was “literally pulled into” by its counterparties, according to Wintermute COO Marina Gurevich.      “We were doing a lot of OTC transactions with various institutional counterparties and many of them were asking us to offer RFQ so they could trade more with us,” Gurevich said via email. “With institutional demand for OTC growing in December, we’ve seen demand accelerate, so we were doing pilots and are launching Beta RFQ now.”    Read more: Lightspeed Venture Invests $2.8M in Crypto Market Maker Wintermute    Founded in 2017, Wintermute provides liquidity on more than 500 spot trading pairs, on dYdX perpetual swaps and a handful of crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) from 21Shares. As well as centralized exchanges and OTC, Wintermute is focused on the burgeoning world of decentralized finance (DeFi).      Gurevich said Wintermute will look to provide liquidity to decentralized exchanges (DEXs) that the firm believes in, even if their volumes are low.      “We work with many DeFi projects supporting liquidity of their tokens on CeFi exchanges. We don't charge fees and we partner with the projects we believe can have an impact long-term,” Gurevich said. “We help projects start AMMs [automated market makers] and support liquidity there.

42385703,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB91Wl,1611145800,Valid Points: Why Ethereum 2.0 Shifts How Investors Value ETH,"What is the intrinsic value of ether?      This is a question I’ve been wrestling with this past week as the ether price set a new all-time high of $1,439.33, according to CoinDesk’s price index.      Similar to how many view the current bitcoin price bull run as being credibly different from previous cycles for reasons to do with greater institutional involvement and mainstream interest, among other reasons, I get the sense that the valuation of ether by investors is being looked at this time around in a different light.      The primary reason for why I believe ether’s valuation has shifted in fundamental ways this market cycle compared to previous ones is because this December Ethereum officially launched its parallel staking network, Ethereum 2.0.      If you’re new to Valid Points and the topic of Ethereum 2.0 in general, be sure to check out our 101 explainer on Eth 2.0 metrics to get up to speed about jargon and terminology used throughout this newsletter.      The daily average income of Ethereum 2.0 validators in terms of ETH has been on the slight decline since last week. According to BeaconScan, average income has dropped over the month of January from 0.008063 ETH/day to 0.007768 ETH/day. In dollar terms, however, income has been on the rise given bullish price trends pushing the value of ETH up 66.03% year-to-date.      User participation on the Ethereum 2.0 network has also been increasing at a steady pace of close to 900 new validators each day. There are over 65,000 validators, each staking 32 ETH worth roughly $45,000, at time of writing. An additional 16,000 validators are in a holding queue for entry into the network over the next few weeks.      Because of the continued growth of new users on Eth 2.0, a greater percentage of total ether supply is getting locked away and becoming unusable on the original Ethereum blockchain. Roughly 2.4% of all ETH in circulation is now immovable from Eth 2.0. Some Ethereum investors believe this percentage will grow to be as high as 30% in the future.      A large percentage of total supply being removed from active circulation among decentralized applications (dapps) and transactions between users impacts the velocity of ether as a digital currency. Velocity is the rate or frequency at which units of a currency are exchanged in an economy, or in the case of Ethereum, in a blockchain system. If we think about ETH as money, ETH’s velocity is negatively impacted as a result of Ethereum 2.0.      However, as certain Ethereum experts have pointed out, ETH, unlike BTC, is much more than an asset for transfers of value, or even a store of value for that matter. ETH can be likened to a commodity asset needed for fueling a new decentralized web and financial system. ETH can also be viewed as a capital asset inextricably linked in value to the popularization and adoption of proof-of-stake blockchain protocols.      With the advent of Ethereum 2.0, long-term holdings in ETH represent long-term bets on the decentralized web and/or finance, as well as the viability, scalability and security of proof-of-stake blockchains to the same, if not higher degree, than proof-of-work blockchains.      There are a number of other use cases for Ethereum’s native crypto asset, ether, besides its use as payment for decentralized applications and staking on Ethereum 2.0. However, these are two that are likely to continue motivating investments in ETH as Ethereum 2.0 development advances.    New frontiers    Ether has set a new record price at $1,439 for the first time in three years, some five days to the date.      A lot has changed since then. In this week’s New Frontiers, we’ll take a look at some major headlines – good and bad – that have defined the cryptocurrency’s journey since January 2018:      $6.3 Billion: 2018 ICO Funding Has Passed 2017’s Total - April 2018      Initial coin offerings (ICOs) raised more money in the first three months of 2018 than the whole of 2017, according to data collected by CoinDesk.      In April 2018, the company known for having raised the most amount of funds from an ICO was messaging app provider Telegram. The funds raised accumulated to a total of $1.7 billion. However, in just a few months, blockchain startup Block.one would raise $4 billion through its yearlong ICO for the crypto asset EOS.      Ethereum’s ASIC Rebellion Heats Up With New Effort to Brick Big Miners – September 2018      Mining is a nuisance to many Ethereum fans, which is why it’ll slowly be phased out with Eth 2.0.      A new mining algorithm called Programmatic Proof-of-Work (ProgPoW) sparked life into this conversation before the February 2019 Constantinople hard fork. ProgPow would have made it easier for small miners to participate in the mining game. Yet, it ultimately failed to be implemented. It’s failure now stands as a lesson in “how to do” decentralized governance.      Ethereum Upgrades as Hard Forks Activate on Blockchain – February 2019      The Constantinople and St. Petersburg hard forks were pushed live to the mainnet. The sixth and seventh backward-incompatible code changes prepared Eth 1.x for its future marriage with the Eth 2.0 Beacon Chain. Ethereum hard forked twice again one year later with the Istanbul and Muir Glacier updates.      ‘Scam’ or Iteration? At Devcon, Ethereum Diehards Still Believe in 2.0 – October 2019      CoinDesk reported live from DevCon 5 in Osaka, Japan, – the last physical Ethereum DevCon before the Covid-19 pandemic. The annual gathering of Ethereum developers reacted to Ethereum co-founder and venture firm ConsenSys CEO Joe Lubin acknowledging that Ethereum wouldn’t be able to scale under the original roadmap. Of course, that’s what Ethereum 2.0 is for.      Matter Labs Unveils Layer 2 Scaling Solution for Ethereum Payments – December 2019      Ethereum startup Matter Labs unveiled its layer 2 solution, Zk-Sync, for increasing how many transactions Ethereum can handle from its decentralized applications (dapp). Within a year, rollups would widely become considered a part of Ethereum’s long-term scaling roadmap.      Note: Startup Optimism launched its own rollup variant called the Optimism Virtual Machine (OVM) last Friday.      Why DeFi’s Billion-Dollar Milestone Matters – February 2020      For Ethereum, 2020 was the year of decentralized finance (DeFi). These Ethereum native applications allow for the trading, lending and borrowing of digital assets. The total value locked (TVL) – a metric not dissimilar from assets under management (AUM) – broke over $1 billion by February 2020 and has since shot past $25 billion, according to DeFi Pulse.

42385706,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB91UF,1611144422,Bitcoin Falls 5% Despite Continued Accumulation by Investors,"Investors continuing to buy bitcoin didn't stop the top cryptocurrency by market value from slipping by over $2,600 on Wednesday.      Bitcoin fell from $36,000 to $34,000 this morning (UTC time) and was last seen changing hands near $34,300, representing a 5% drop on the day, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      The price drop comes a day after U.S. Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen suggested lawmakers ""curtail"" the use of cryptocurrencies amid terrorism concerns. ""I think many [cryptocurrencies] are used, at least in transactions sense, mainly for illicit financing and I think we really need to examine ways in which we can curtail their use and make sure that anti-money laundering doesn’t occur through those channels,” Yellen said Tuesday.      While the cryptocurrency is down, it's still within a week-long narrowing price range, as seen on the chart below.      A move below the lower end of the triangle would expose support at $30,000. Strength in the Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the greenback's value against other major currencies, and regulatory concerns could trigger a bitcoin range breakdown. The DXY's performance has had a big influence on bitcoin's price since the March crash. At press time, the DXY is flat-lined near 90.50.      The odds, however, appear stacked against a notable price drop, as bitcoin investors remain undeterred by the bull market's pause and continue to boost their holdings.      The number of addresses holding at least 1,000 BTC has risen from 2,407 to a new lifetime high of 2,438 in the past seven days, according to data source Glassnode. The rise does not necessarily imply the same growth in the number of investors, as a single person or entity can hold multiple addresses.      Meanwhile, the number of bitcoins locked up in accumulation addresses has gone up by 30,000 to 2,739,166 BTC in the past week. Accumulation addresses are those that have at least two incoming ""non-dust"" transfers and have never spent funds. Dust refers to insignificantly tiny amounts of the digital asset.      The metric does not include addresses belonging to miners and exchanges, and excludes addresses last active more than seven years ago to adjust for lost coins.      Lastly, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the biggest publicly traded crypto investment trust, purchased a total of 16,244 BTC ($607 million) on Monday, sucking out significantly more supply from the market than miners had added.      Also read: Bitcoin Becomes Most-Crowded Trade After Passing ‘Long Tech’: Bank of America Survey      Grayscale's inflows aided the price rally from $15,000 to over $41,000 seen in the past three months and are pivotal for bull market continuation, according to JPMorgan. Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk’s parent company.      It remains to be seen if persistent buying from large investors translates into a quick recovery. A breakout from the narrowing price range would imply a continuation of the bull run and open the doors for the psychological hurdle of $50,000.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/20/bitcoin-falls-5-despite-continued-accumulation-by-investors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1e41739fa8d364511a7c3ff8d6404ef18dbb7775-1200x822.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385683,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB5xa1,1611134566,Trustee of Collapsed Exchange Moves to Resolve Crypto vs. Fiat Creditor Claims Tussle,"Ernst and Young (EY), the bankruptcy trustee for the defunct exchange QuadrigaCX, is trying to resolve a dispute over how to value the firm's cryptocurrency assets before disbursement to creditors.      EY will head to court on Jan. 26 to argue the valuation date for cryptocurrency claims should be considered from the date of the exchange's bankruptcy on April 15, 2019. The firm is taking a different stance from affected user, crypto startup BlockCAT, which wants the digital assets to be valued as of Feb. 5, 2019, when Quadriga received court protection to restructure under Canadian federal law.      The date used will greatly affect how cryptocurrency is valued and, thus, how much creditors receive from the remaining pool of assets.      BlockCAT has made a claim of 4 million Canadian dollars (US$3.14 million). Seeking to maximize its payout, it has brought a motion arguing the date for valuing cryptocurrency claims of other users should commence from the exchange's initial court order with respect to the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA).      The issue at hand pits Quadriga's former users who have predominantly cryptocurrency claims against creditors who predominantly have claims for fiat currency. In total, Quadriga users have made 17,053 claims with a value of either CAD$224 million or CAD$291 million, depending on the date used for asset valuation.      The trustee has to pay out claims made for cryptocurrency and U.S. dollars in Canadian dollars, meaning the court must decide on a date for valuation before it can proceed with disbursement.      A factum (a statement of the facts of the case) was filed by EY to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice on Tuesday in connection with its motion for an order to use the prevailing exchange rate on the date of bankruptcy for the conversions.      According to commercial litigator Evan Thomas, who assessed the trustee’s figures as outlined in the factum, a user with a claim solely for CAD will recover 23% less if the April 15, 2019 date is used.      As shown above, the price of cryptocurrencies between February 2019 and April 2019 typically rose. As such, a former Quadriga user with a claim solely for bitcoin would get 14% more in CAD if the April date is determined as the legitimate date by the courts.      If BlockCAT convinces the court that cryptocurrency claims should be valued at the February date, the relative share of the Quadriga pool to be paid to affected users with CAD claims would increase, Thomas noted.      See also: QuadrigaCX Users’ Law Firm Launches Blockchain Analytics Investigation      The case in novel in Canadian law. ""No bankruptcy court in Canada has previously been asked to determine as at what date claims made in cryptocurrency should be valued in Canadian dollars,"" EY states in the factum.

Kurson was one of 73 individualshttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-regarding-executive-grants-clemency-012021/ who received a full pardon from Trump early Wednesday, less than 12 hours before his presidency is set to end. A further 70 individuals had their sentences commuted, but the list did not include Ross Ulbricht, the Silk Road founder who was reportedly considered for a pardon last month; Julian Assange, the Wikileaks founder who helped popularize the use of bitcoin; or Edward Snowden, who released details about a U.S. surveillance program to Glenn Greenwald, then a reporter at The Guardian.    Other recipients of Wednesday's pardons include former campaign strategist Steve Bannon, who said in 2018 he was working on a cryptocurrency project before his 2020 arrest on fraud charges; rapper Lil Wayne, who faced jail time on a firearms charge; and Kodak Black, who is serving a three-year sentence on weapons charges.      Kurson was arrested in October on charges of cyberstalking his ex-wife, after a background check raised accusations of sending threatening messages, installing keystroke-monitoring software and making false accusations to someone's employer, the New York Times reported at the time.      ""In a powerful letter to the prosecutors, Mr. Kurson's ex-wife wrote on his behalf that she never wanted this investigation or arrest and, 'repeatedly asked for the FBI to drop it … I hired a lawyer to protect me from being forced into yet another round of questioning. My disgust with this arrest and the subsequent articles is bottomless,'"" Wednesday's pardon notice read.      The pardon notice continued on to praise Kurson, who is a friend to Trump son-in-law and presidential adviser Jared Kushner, calling him a ""community leader.""      The lack of Ulbricht's name on the list is likely to disappoint many in the crypto industry, who have been advocating for the Silk Road founder's pardon for years. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), a U.S. congressman since 2012, has been a vocal advocate for pardoning Ulbricht and Snowden.      Trump is officially out of office at noon Eastern time on Wednesday, when President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in. Trump can continue making pardons until that time.
