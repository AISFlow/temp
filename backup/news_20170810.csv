42379758,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Kayv,1502397783,$200 Million In 60 Minutes: Filecoin ICO Rockets to Record Amid Tech Issues,"An initial coin offering (ICO) for the blockchain data storage network Filecoin has raised an estimated $200 million from accredited investors despite being beset by technology issues.  The figures add to the roughly $52 million in tokens sold in a pre-sale to investors like Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures, announced last week. However, at press time, the ICO – which is being conducted via CoinList, a joint project between startup investment platform AngelList and Filecoin developer Protocol Labs – is paused.  The sale halt came just over an hour after it first began at 1 p.m. PT.  Site issues cropped up soon after the sale began, with social media posts showing that some users had problems accessing the site. The Filecoin page on CoinList also displayed problems with the ticker meant to track the total amount raised.  Over the course of the first hour, it reset several times, reverting back to a baseline amount despite showing a rising minimum price. (Filecoin's ICO is utilizing a sale model in which the minimum price buyers would need to pay rises as more investors join in.)  Problems aside, the sale has generated a record-breaking level of investor interest.  Just over 30 minutes into the sale, the Filecoin team announced that it had garnered a total of $252 million in investments – a figure which includes the pre-sale figures.  Of that amount, $186 million is confirmed, according to the Filecoin website. Including the unconfirmed purchases, the ICO represents the largest to date, overtaking the $232 million record hit by the Tezos project in mid-July.  According to data from the CoinDesk ICO Tracker, roughly $1.7 billion has been invested through the ICO model to date, indicating that the Filecoin sale could push this figure past the $2 billion mark.  CoinDesk is monitoring this developing story.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which invested in the Filecoin pre-sale.

42379755,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Kb1R,1502389838,Bitcoin Exchange Coincheck Unveils $450k Startup Investment Fund,"Tokyo-based cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck is launching a new investment fund.  With a preliminary funding cap of 50 million yen (about $450,000), the fund will be used to support startups that are developing blockchain projects. Coincheck, in announcing the move, suggested that this amount could expand depending on the pace of investments.  Notably, the fund will also be leveraged to support teams that are planning to launch initial coin offerings or ICOs, according to co-founder and COO Yusuke Otsuka in an interview with TechCrunch.  Coincheck's explainer on the new investment fund details how it wants to offer business development and technology advice to companies that participate. In the blog post, the exchange cites ""barriers to entry"" for new companies looking to enter the space. As such, Coincheck is positioning the fund as a way to navigate some of the trickier waters involved.  Coincheck first opened its doors in 2014, unveiling its exchange service in September and officially launching in November of that year.  The fund's launch comes amid rising momentum for the tech in Japan.  The past few months have seen a growing number of retailers move to begin testing bitcoin transactions, following a move by the government to deem cryptocurrency as a legal form of payment.

Vnesheconombank (VEB) revealed the partnership last week, which will see the development bank and the Health Ministry exploring how the tech could be used to exchange patient history. It further cited a mandate from the government to create a new interagency data-sharing system – suggesting that this could be one area in which Russian officials apply blockchain.  The bank also revealed that it will launch a ""Centre of Competencies"" through which it will study possible blockchain applications.  Sergey Gorkov, chairman of VEB, said in a statement:  ""The Centre will engage in the development of private blockchain using the concerted efforts of the VEB team and an international professional team capable of accomplishing the tasks set by the Ministry of Health. In its turn, the Ministry is to define areas of blockchain application. To ensure greater consistency of work, we invite the Ministry of Health to join the blockchain working group.""  VEB revealed its plans to develop a host of products and services around blockchain earlier this summer. Reports from this week that indicate that the bank is also testing ethereum for charity payments.  In statements to local media, Gorkov pointed to the need to modernize as one of the driving factors behind its work with the tech.  ""When we started to think about how to manage projects efficiently, we realized that there is no platform,"" he said. ""We realized that the blockchain is a good fundamental and qualitative platform for the future.""

42395309,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASaHHr,1502380809,$100 Million: Coinbase Raises Biggest-Ever Round for Bitcoin Startup,"Coinbase has raised $100 million in Series D funding in what is the largest single traditional funding round for a public blockchain or cryptocurrency startup, according to CoinDesk data.  Announced today, the round was led by Institutional Venture Partners (IVP), a Silicon Valley venture firm that counts some of the biggest tech and digital startups, including Dropbox, GitHub and Netflix, among its portfolio. Also participating are Battery Ventures, Draper Associates, Greylock Partners, Section 32 and Spark Capital.  The round's completion raises Coinbase's collective funding to date to more than $217 million, higher than any other industry firm that has raised money from accredited investors.  Put in context, cryptocurrency and distributed ledger startups have raised a combined $1.9 billion to date, meaning Coinbase now accounts for 10% of all venture capital invested in blockchain startups.  In statements, Coinbase said that it would use the funds to expand its customer support and engineering teams, a statement that follows previous commitments to growing support amid a wave of diversifying customer complaints.  Numbers game  Taking another look at the data, Coinbase has now raised two of the industry's largest funding rounds since it was founded in June 2012 and incubated by Y Combinator.  Most recently, Coinbase completed a Series C funding round in early 2015, netting $75 million from a group of investors that included the New York Stock Exchange and Fortune 500 financial services group USAA. In between, it also raised $10.5 million from Mitsubishi UFJ.  In context, however, it is the Series C and Series D rounds that stand out as among the industry's largest.  Still, Coinbase's $100 million round is notably less than the $107 million raised by distributed ledger startup R3 as part of its Series A round revealed in May. Notably, that figure is expected to climb with the addition of a third tranche of capital yet to be closed.  While widely reported in excess of $110 million, fellow Andreessen Horowitz portfolio firm 21 Inc likely never raised this funding in a single round. Investor materials obtained by CoinDesk indicate it was raising a $75 million Series C in early 2015.  The idea that the funding was raised over time, in smaller rounds, is also backed by reporting by author Nathaniel Popper, who reports a smaller $25 million round was never publicly disclosed.  ICO blues  Put in another context, however, Coinbase's funding is lower than three other open-source blockchain projects.  According to the CoinDesk ICO Tracker, blockchain projects have raised more than $1.6 billion by selling cryptographic data designed to power their protocols through a funding method known as an initial coin offering (ICO) or token sale.  And while it's not exactly an apples-to-apples comparison (ICOs are a new and poorly understood funding mechanism), showing the Coinbase raise in context does serve to show potential of that market.  It also highlights its potential excess.  While Coinbase has been active for years, has hundreds of employees and boasts $25 billion in user trading volume on its exchange product GDAX, many ICO products have raised more from investors with little more than a white paper and highly criticized code.  Still, with more traditional VCs showing a willingness to investor in ICOs and tokens, the metric will likely be one to watch as it sheds light the ongoing changes in the blockchain funding sector.

42379760,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Kb2h,1502371804,Buyers Beware: Singapore Central Bank Issues ICO Warning,"Singapore's central bank has issued an investor warning about the risks of initial coin offerings (ICOs).  A new notice from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) – published in tandem with the Commercial Affairs Department (the administration layer for the city-state's police force) – advises prospective investors to investigate and understand the risks associated with buying into token sales.  Among the suggestions offered for investors is that they should deal only with firms licensed by the MAS itself.  The notice states:  ""The laws administered by MAS require disclosure of information on investment products being offered to consumers. MAS-regulated entities are also subject to conduct rules, which aim to ensure that they deal fairly with consumers. If consumers deal with entities that are not regulated by MAS, they forgo the protection afforded under laws administered by MAS.""  The statement highlights other risks, including the potential for a lack of market liquidity, the high rate at which startups fail and the potential for fraud.  The MAS said that consumers who suspect that a token-based investment scheme may be fraudulent, ""should report such cases to the police.""  The warning comes just over a week after the MAS issued a statement detailing that, under its rules, some token sales may qualify as securities offerings. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission released a similar advisory late last month.  ICOs have steadily gained traction in recent months, according to CoinDesk's ICO Tracker. To date, nearly $1.7 billion has been raised through the funding model, with more than $500 million in the last month alone.

42379769,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KbCl,1502369954,"Coco Revealed: Microsoft, JPMorgan & More Demo Blockchain-Boosting Tech","Microsoft is today revealing a new blockchain framework designed to make it easier to build enterprise networks using any distributed ledger.  Out of the box, the new Coco platform – built to supercharge transaction speeds and simplify governance decisions – will be integrated with a number of popular open-source blockchains and distributed ledgers, including ethereum, R3's Corda, Hyperledger Sawtooth and JPMorgan's Quorum.  But it's the trusted security capabilities that Microsoft Azure CTO Mark Russinovich positioned as key to making the platform more than just an improvement of degrees.  In addition to integration with Microsoft's own software-based trusted execution environment, Russinovich said the framework can be made compatible with Intel's hardware-based software guard extensions, known as SGXs.  As more companies look to convert these open-source technologies into enterprise-grade solutions, he further positioned the new platform as one that would accelerate time to market and simplify management after they go live.  Speaking at a press demo, Russinovich said:  ""The Coco Framework is invisible from the protocol itself. It provides these capabilities – the high performance, the security confidentiality, the governance – built in.""  In the first-ever live demo, the framework resulted in an increased volume of 1,700 transactions per second on a private version of the ethereum blockchain.  The average transaction volume of blockchains integrated with Coco (short for ""confidential consortium"") is about 1,600 transactions per second, and it features a built-in governance model that lets consortia members vote on all terms and conditions of a network, including when members can be added or ejected.  While the framework is capable of being powered by the Microsoft Azure cloud-computing offering, the open-source code can be run from any cloud platform or on-site, the company said.  The framework was revealed in tandem with the publication of a white paper outlining how Coco is designed to integrate with a wide range of blockchains and distributed ledgers. Going forward, it will be formally contributed to the open-source community next year, when it is published on GitHub.  ""This is the flexibility of Coco Framework,"" said Russinovich. ""Any ledger can be build into it.""  From open source to enterprise  Stepping back, Coco is the latest development in Microsoft's strategy to provide increasingly advanced services for companies seeking to turn open-source blockchain code into enterprise-grade products.  In late 2015, Microsoft made its public entrance into the industry with its blockchain-as-a-service tool kit for a number of open-source platforms. Since then, the company launched Project Bletchley, designed to simplify the creation of blockchain consortia, and it has unveiled plans for enterprise-grade smart contracts.  With the release of Coco next year, Russinovich said users will be able better balance the trade-offs experienced by companies of having to choose between performance and security when building on a blockchain.  JPMorgan blockchain program lead Amber Baldet explained during a panel conversation at the demo why her company plans to use Coco, in spite of the fact that it created the original Quorum kernel.  Baldet said:  ""What we're looking at doing is making this an additional additive, [an] optional piece that enterprises can use to provide additional degrees of security and performance to Quorum's already operational confidentiality and performance model.""  Tech specs  In two separate live demonstrations of the Coco Framework, both the speed and security of the technology were put on display.  During a speed test, Coco achieved approximately 1,700 transactions per second using a private version of the ethereum blockchain, compared to about 13 transactions per second without the framework.  The ""main reason"" for the improvement, according to Microsoft senior program manager Christine Avanessians, is that the blockchain was being processed in a trusted environment, allowing for a ""simplified consensus mechanism,"" in this case, RAFT.  In the security demo, RFID company Mojix showed how Coco could be used to create permissioned access to a private version of ethereum that only lets certain participants view certain purchase orders, while ensuring the order was accurate.  Intel's vice president in charge of the software and services group, Rick Echevarria, explaining why his company joined the initiative, hinted at why the framework could come to be adopted broadly among enterprise firms, stating:  ""We're going to remove a lot of barriers, the scalability barrier, the privacy barrier and the security barriers, so now companies that are building blockchain technologies can focus on what adds value to their business.""

42379761,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Kb3x,1502366431,Medical Society of Delaware Tests Blockchain to Improve Healthcare Access,"A medical organization in the U.S. that dates back hundreds of years is embarking on a blockchain pilot.  The Medical Society of Delaware, first formed in 1776, has revealed it will build a proof-of-concept focusing on the pre-authorization process for care providers and medical insurers. By improving the efficiency of that step, the society said it hopes care can be delivered more quickly.  As a further benefit, the trial will also create a chain of patient records that can be accessed by insurers and medical care providers.  Partnering on the project is healthcare tech startup Medscient, which itself leverages technology developed by blockchain-focused startup Symbiont.  Andrew Dahlke, vice president of the Medical Society of Delaware, said in a statement:  ""We are confident that this proof-of-concept will not only address this particular pain point, but will lay the groundwork for streamlining other healthcare administrative issues as well.""  Those involved with the project are due to make a presentation at the Medicaid Enterprise Systems Conference, to be held later this month in Baltimore, Maryland.  The news comes shortly after Delaware became the first U.S. state to pass a law allowing the use of blockchain to create and store business records, including stock ledgers – an effort that was first unveiled in 2016.

42379751,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Kav9,1502362801,Crypto Asset Firm Launches Investable Index for Top 30 Cryptocurrencies,"One of the cryptocurrency world's more tenured fund managers is launching two new products aimed at bringing the emerging asset class mainstream.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Tim Enneking's Crypto Asset Management is today releasing a new product called CAMCrypto30 – a cryptocurrency index designed to mirror the 30 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. In addition, the firm also announced a new, investable share class for the fund, which will track the cryptocurrencies listed in the index.  If successful, the index could one day be used as a shorthand for discussing cryptocurrency market movements, providing a reference point akin to an equity index. As indices are standard for traditional asset classes, this would allow investors to better analyze and track performance relative to other asset classes in their portfolios.  Index tracking products, such as the new share class, are designed to allow investors to gain broad exposure to an asset class while diversifying their holdings within it.  CAMCrypto30, which was constructed to resemble the Russell 2000 and FTSE 100 indices, is weighted by market cap.  Enneking told CoinDesk:  ""We've used those two indices as our model because they are the closest to what seems to be appropriate in the crypto space. Not only is there no real index – there is certainly no investable index.""  Unpacking the product  So, what's available today? For one, the index itself, which is separate from the investment vehicle, now has its own website.  An embeddable widget has also been made public for third-party websites to track CAMCrypto30 index data. (Notably, the index will be rebalanced monthly to better track the fast-moving cryptocurrency world, instead of being rebalanced quarterly, as is more typical with equity indices).  Otherwise, investors in the Crypto Asset Management fund are now able to participate in three separate fund classes, each of which provides exposure to a different type of investment.  The new index-tracking I-Class joins two other existing cryptocurrency fund classes: an L-Class, which is used to generate exposure to short-term lending rates, and a T-Class, which is a trading class.  All three classes are issued by two open-ended funds: a U.S.-based master fund, which is structured as a Delaware LLC, and a Cayman Islands-based feeder fund, primarily for international investors. The former, called Crypto Asset Management LLC, is open to accredited investors in the U.S., and is subject to a $25,000 minimum investment.  All Class-I shares, which track CAMCrypto30, have a fee structure of 2.5 percent on funds committed, but fees are not charged on returns, since there is no discretionary management involved in tracking the index.

As reported last year by CoinDesk, the state unveiled a wide-ranging blockchain and cryptocurrency initiative last November. Illinois has since embarked on a multi-agency effort to explore public applications of the technology, while also releasing new rules for startups working with cryptocurrencies.  Now, the Illinois Blockchain Initiative has partnered with Hashed Health, a U.S.-based blockchain startup focused on medical applications, to see whether the tech can help streamline how medical licenses are issued and tracked.  The program's backers expect to build a license registry and medical credential-sharing system running on a blockchain, with smart contracts automatically updating information. The ultimate goal is to create an authentic and transparent chain of records for patients and healthcare provider networks.  The news is the latest signal out of Illinois that state officials are seriously looking at how to apply the techology to real-world problems. Illinois held a month-long hackathon focused on blockchain during June, and, the same month, a group of businesses launched a Chicago-based blockchain center backed by the government.

42379766,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Kb8z,1502355615,UK Police Want to Change the Law to Make Bitcoin Seizures Easier,"A research office backed by a number of U.K. law enforcement groups has proposed changing the country's laws to make seizing bitcoin easier.  Released last week by the N8 Policing Research Partnership, the report is largely an overview of cryptocurrencies and the challenges for law enforcement who encounter them. However, according to the authors, those challenges are largely driven by a lack of institutional knowledge among British police officials.  It goes on to outline how this problem could be addressed, suggesting a broad training initiative and the wide deployment of tracing software to investigators.  Perhaps most notably, though, the report states that the group asked the U.K. Home Office, which oversees the country's law enforcement agencies, to consider classifying bitcoin as a form of cash so that police can seize holdings more easily during investigations.  The report states:  ""A recommendation has also been made to the Home Office regarding a potential legislative amendment to categorize bitcoin as cash for the purpose of cash seizure legislation.""  N8, which lists 11 police groups based in and around Northern England as partners on its website, also said it has prepared guidance on how police can seize bitcoin under both the Police and Criminal Evidence Act and the Proceeds of Crime Act.  Whether the Home Office acts on the recommendation remains to be seen. The department has investigated blockchain technology before, however. It conducted a wide-ranging research effort in 2015, which resulted in a call for the creation of a new government-backed cryptocurrency.

42379734,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KYqp,1502352023,SegWit in the Wild: 4 Lessons Bitcoin Can Learn from Litecoin,"Bitcoin reached a crucial technical and political milestone this week, locking in the long-debated code change Segregated Witness (SegWit).  The milestone, advocates hope, will provide a much-needed transaction capacity boost and – longer-term – open doors for more impactful scaling technologies.  But the idea saw its fair share of contention on its way to lock-in. While it aroused grassroots support from users who arguably helped push it through, it also attracted critics who were serious enough to split from bitcoin and form a new cryptocurrency that excluded it completely.  So, what will happen when the code change goes live? We're not without examples of what we can expect.  After some contentious back-and-forth between miners and users, litecoin, the fourth largest public blockchain network, was able to push through SegWit three months ago. As such, many believe litecoin, a fork of bitcoin's code, can act as a test platform for SegWit, providing real-world insight into adoption hurdles.  Here's what those close to the project have to say about the results:  1. SegWit is working (so far)  Arguably the most important takeaway is that SegWit hasn't led to any problems on the litecoin network itself – as of mid-June, the Litecoin Foundation reported there have been ""no issues.""  This is notable given the amount of controversy the change has created within the bitcoin ecosystem.  Some critics argued SegWit was too complexhttp://zander.github.io/posts/Who%20Wants%20SegWit/ and put the network at risk. For instance, it was suggested that if SegWit was activated (and certain other changes were made to bitcoin in the future), miners would be able to steal the coins from certain types of addresses.  The claim was put to the test on the litecoin network, though, with one user creating a $1 million-worth of litecoin ""bounty"" using a SegWit address. Attached was also a note that read, ""Let's see if segwit really is ‘anyone-can-spend’ or not.""  So far, no one has claimed the litecoin in the contract.  2. SegWit transactions are growing  Litecoin Foundation directors Xinxi Wang and Franklyn Richards have both admitted there haven't been many SegWit transactions across the network to date.  Although, the directors' sentiments are without precise measurements.  University of Freiburg computer science researcher Jochen Hoenicke explained the measurement challenges in this way – while you can label a transaction a SegWit transaction if it's sent ""from"" a SegWit-enabled wallet, you can't if the transaction is only sent ""to"" a SegWit-enabled wallet.  Put another way, transactions sent to SegWit-enabled wallets look identical to another complex transaction type, meaning they can't be monitored.  As such, Heonicke has compiled a list of litecoin SegWit transactions sent from wallets that support the new transaction type. According to his data, roughly 100 out of 10,000 total transactions per day are SegWit transactions.  3. Businesses are accommodating the change  And while Heonicke recognizes the list is incomplete because of the discrepancy in how transactions can be measured, he's noticed one trend.  ""The number is increasing as support rises,"" he said, pointing to hardware wallet Trezor's announcement on June 7 that it was adding SegWit as its default transaction type. After that, he said, there was a noticeable jump (from nearly zero to double digits) in the number of litecoin SegWit transactions happening per day.  And as litecoin wallets and exchanges take the steps to support the code change, more SegWit transactions are likely to follow. According to Richards, other wallets, such as LoafWallet, are making progress on a SegWit upgrade.  In contrast, many bitcoin wallets already support SegWit, as they've been anticipating the change for over a year, so it's likely bitcoin will see more use of the feature.  Richards also argued there are important differences between litecoin and bitcoin that make SegWit less crucial for its operation. Namely litecoin doesn’t have the same high transaction volume.  ""The scaling part of SegWit was predominantly for bitcoin to try and alleviate its network congestion, something that litecoin does not suffer from,"" Richards told CoinDesk.  Litecoin companies then don’t feel the same urgency to update their software to support the change.  ""But I foresee that SegWit will probably be used extensively on bitcoin immediately after activation,"" Wang remarked.  4. Some wallets and users had trouble  Adoption metrics aside, Hoenicke pointed to some other ""minor"" technical issues.  Because of a bug in the mobile litecoin wallet Electrum-LTC, old versions of the software would ""break"" when users sent a SegWit transaction to the wallets.  Hoenicke noted another problem that, while specific to litecoin, highlights user confusion when things are changed around. Since litecoin is in the process of phasing in a new address type, some users needed to convert between the two types.  ""Some accidentally sent bitcoins to their litecoin SegWit address after using the conversion tool and now have to wait for SegWit to activate on bitcoin,"" Hoenicke said.  While these are problems facing specific businesses and users, bad user experiences could cause discontent in the bitcoin community, especially since there's already been a long struggle over the change.
