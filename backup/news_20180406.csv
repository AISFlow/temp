In a statement posted to its website (and circulated via social media), the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said:  ""...all Banks/ DFIs/ Microfinance Banks and Payment System Operators (PSOs)/Payment Service Providers (PSPs) are advised to refrain from processing, using, trading, holding, transferring value, promoting and investing in Virtual Currencies/Tokens. Further, banks/DFIs/Microfinance Banks and PSOs/PSPs will not facilitate their customers/account holders to transact in VCs/ICO Tokens. Any transaction in this regard shall immediately be reported to Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU) as a suspicious transaction.""  The central bank did not respond to a request for comment. But as of press time, the announcement is already having an impact on the local cryptocurrency scene.  Urdubit, a cryptocurrency exchange that first launched in 2014 with the goal of building a base of support in the region, said in the wake of the statement that it will shut down. Urdubit was the first bitcoin exchange platform to open its doors in the country.  The decision was announced via Facebook, with the startup urging its customers to ""please withdraw your funds as soon as possible.""  Urdubit's Facebook post included a link to correspondence from the central bank, which including the warning about transactions being tagged as suspicious.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Rodrigo Souza, the co-founder of BlinkTrade (which provided the open-source software that Urdubit has used) argued that the central bank move is aimed at putting the brakes on cryptocurrency investment.  ""Governments and Banks are going to fight Bitcoin because investing Bitcoin means a bank run on the central bank,"" he said, going on to add:  ""We are working hard to return all PKR to all our customers before our bank shutdown our accounts.""  The move comes a day after India's central bank blocked banks from doing business with cryptocurrency exchanges. But as CoinDesk subsequently reported, exchanges in that country are eyeing a legal challenge that could see the dispute argued before India's highest court.

42380513,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gGBl,1523047855,Arizona's Crypto Tax Payments Bill Is Being Revamped,"Arizona's cryptocurrency tax payments bill is being reworked, according to one of its sponsors, with the hope of putting it forward for a vote in the coming weeks.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Arizona Representative Jeff Weninger detailed the work being done on the measure, which, as previously reported by CoinDesk, would allow residents in the state to pay their tax liabilities with cryptocurrency.  The Arizona Senate advanced the measure back in February, but public records seemed to indicate that the proposed law was stalling in the House of Representatives after a committee had recommended its passage.  ""We’re still working on moving it,"" Weninger said, explaining that he was working with Senator Warren Petersen – who drafted the measure – on some changes. One key alteration would make the language more ""agnostic"" about which cryptocurrencies can be used, with the term ""bitcoin"" specifically being stripped out of the bill itself.  ""I made some changes to it with Senator Petersen's permission that we would become more agnostic about name specific digital currencies. We're leaving it up to the Revenue Department to pin that.""  Weninger indicated that the reworked bill would also leave it up to tax officials to decide whether they would set up their own method of exchanging crypto to U.S. dollars, or arrange ""a competitive process to let startups compete to convert it and send U.S. dollars,"" he added.  ""I’m hopeful that and anticipating that it’ll be there in the next week or two. There’s a lot going on and we’re doing everything we can to get all the members comfortable with it and understand it,"" he said, explaining that some lawmakers were expressing caution due to a lack of understanding about the tech – a circumstance that scuttled a similar measure in the U.S. state of Georgia.  Speaking more broadly, Weninger argued that Arizona has positioned itself as a positive environment for startups working with the tech, owing to the legislation passed to date. The first of those, signed into law last year, was submitted by Weninger and recognized blockchain signatures and smart contracts as legally valid.  ""I think with the package of bills that we’ve done, we’re showing that we’re welcome to these new-age entrepreneurs and this new technology and we’re very much encouraged and we hope people are noticing it,"" he told CoinDesk, adding:  ""We hope to lead on this and other technologies in the future.""

On Thursday, the agency said Mark Moncher and his company, Financial Freedom Club, had paired up with another individual, Frank Dalotto (who operates 911MoneyStorey, which was also cited) to sell the shares. Though the platform wasn't named, the SSB said that Moncher and Dalotto promised weekly investment returns as high as 8 percent in advertising materials circulated online to Texas residents.  The agency also alleged that the parties involved sought to conceal the nature of the investments by sending invoices for watches instead of securities, explaining in its statement:  ""Dalotto, Moncher, and their companies are also encouraging investors to commit felony offenses in connection with an initial $2,000 investment in the trading program. According to the order, investors are told that after making the initial investment via a charge or debit card, they will receive an invoice for the purchase of 'a gold Seiko watch which you’ll never get.'""  ""Dalotto’s statements are encouraging investors to file a materially false or misleading written statement with a financial institution, a state criminal offense in Texas,"" the SSB added.  Moncher and Financial Freedom Club were also implicated in another alleged investment scheme – this one focused on a cannabis growing operation – that involved another firm called Capital Cash. The scheme appears to be wholly separate from the cryptocurrency trading platform, according to statements.  Yet like the crypto-related investment, according to the SSB, the securities involved were not registered for sale in the state.  In an email, SSB Enforcement Division director Joseph Rotunda noted that Dalotto concealed a prior criminal conviction for wire fraud from potential investors.  Rotunda said these issues ""demonstrate the continued need for ... protections.""  ""Investors need to continue to be cautious when investing with an online investment program. Their best defense is due diligence, but they should remember that fraudsters may be attempting to thwart their efforts to obtain meaningful information,"" he added.

Startups like Unocoin, Coinsecure and Zebpay have warned about potential disruptions to their services if their banking providers pull out of the market as ordered in the next three months. But at the same time, statements suggest the industry is preparing to mount a legal challenge.  India's central bank announced the prohibition Thursday, as previously reported. Under the new stipulation, ""entities regulated by RBI shall not deal with or provide services to any individual or business entities dealing with or settling [cryptocurrencies].""

""We, along with the other industry players are in talks with IAMAI and BACC to see if they could help us in getting a hearing at the Supreme Court to see if stay orders are possible on the current decision of the RBI,"" she told CoinDesk.  At the same time, Samuel acknowledged the impact that the RBI's announcement would have on the space, given that it seeks to cut off access to the financial system.  ""This will impact all crypto exchanges across to the country, as that would leave users with no options to deposit/withdraw fiat from these platforms. The only way forward would mean that users will move to an alt - alt trading or the cash market,"" said Samuel.  Unocoin put out a statement earlier Friday, explaining that it hadn't been contacted about the bank ban and that ""when they do and if it has an impact on you and /or us, we will surely communicate to you.""  Likewise, Zebpay announced on Twitter that ""a sudden disruption in banking services could affect our ability to service deposits and withdrawals.""  At the same time, the startup remarked that ""we remain committed to keeping customer funds and assets secure, and are exploring various options.""  Zebpay’s chief executive, Ajeet Khurana, struck a more defiant tone in remarks on Twitter, writing:  ""No way I am stopping.

42380516,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gGEH,1523032525,Vitalik Opposes Fork to Disable Ethereum ASICs,"Vitalik Buterin is coming out against a proposal that would find the blockchain he created changing its software to limit the performance of mining hardware designed to yield a greater cut of the network's rewards.  Issued in a biweekly developer meeting Friday, Buterin's comments come in response to the launch of a new product by mining hardware supplier Bitmain earlier this week. Announced Tuesday, the Antminer E3 has already emerged as a topic of some controversy, with many ethereum developers coming out in favor of a fork that would effectively disable the hardware.  Speaking in the meeting, core developer Piper Merriam went so far as to detail a technical proposal for how this would be achieved so as to keep GPU cards as the primary mining mechanism.  Still, Buterin suggested the issue may not be worth the coordination required to make the change, stating:  ""Getting everybody to upgrade is likely to be fairly chaotic and detract from more important things. So, at this point I personally lean quite significantly towards no action.""  Merriam, who has led the effort to propose code that would mitigate ASIC effectiveness, emphasized that the current proposal is a short-term solution that would not provide protection against the ASICs indefinitely. Rather, the current proposal functions simply ""to break existing hardware,"" Merriam said.  In response, Buterin argued that any such efforts may not be necessary, and could redirect resources away from a scheduled change that would eliminate hardware-based mining entirely.  Elsewhere in that meeting, there were signs that ethereum's shift away from mining is getting closer to reality. Community manager Hudson Jameson said that from May, the code will undergo a formal verification process that is expected to last five months.  However, Jameson said if the ethereum community still felt strongly in favor of a fork, it can continue efforts in that direction irrespective of the core developers.  ""If the community truly wants this to happen and has a good enough reason we can definitely do that, but for right now it sounds like consensus of the core devs to not do anything at this time,"" he said.  In the meeting, Buterin also broached the topic of his recent proposal to introduce a cap on ether issuance. Pending approval from the community, this could be introduced into the next network upgrade, or alongside Casper, the developer said.

42380509,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gG9F,1523028318,SEC Sues Public Company That Saw Crypto Stock Price Boost,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed a lawsuit against Longfin Corp, a company that saw its price jump more than 2,000 percent late last year after it announced the acquisition of a blockchain startup.  The SEC alleged Friday that the company's CEO, Venkata Meenavalli, and three other individuals were involved in stock sales made after Longfin's dizzying price increase last December that raked in millions in profits.  According to statements, Longfin issued ""more than two million"" unregistered, restricted shares to Amro Altahawi, as well as ""tens of thousands of restricted shares"" to Dorababu Penumarthi and Suresh Tammineedi, all of whom were named as defendants in a newly unsealed complaint.  ""The SEC alleges that Amro Izzelden “Andy” Altahawi, Dorababu Penumarthi, and Suresh Tammineedi then illegally sold large blocks of their restricted Longfin shares to the public while the stock price was highly elevated. Through their sales, Altahawi, Penumarthi, and Tammineedi collectively reaped more than $27 million in profits,"" the agency said.  The agency also announced Friday that it had obtained a court order freezing the $27 million in stock proceeds.  LongFin was one of a number of startups to see its stock fortunes rise after announcing a pivot to blockchain or cryptocurrency services.  In December, Longfin's stock price exceeded $70 at one point – as of today, that price is hovering around $28, according to market data published by Google. Shortly before the SEC's announcement, Nasdaq announced that it was halting trading of Longfin's stock.  The SEC's chairman, Jay Clayton, disclosed in January that the agency was scrutinizing such moves by public firms.

42380523,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gGN5,1523024151,Verge Stole the Limelight in a Lackluster Week for the Crypto Markets,"The wider cryptocurrency markets have largely traded sideways in the first week of April, but a few notable exceptions did manage to buck the trend.  As of writing, the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies is seen at $248 billion – only slightly down from the $251 billion seen on March 30.  Bitcoin was showing signs of bullishness in the first half of the week, rising as high as $7,500, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. However, the relief rally was short-lived and prices fell back below the $7,000 mark on April 4. Currently, the cryptocurrency is trading around $6,620 – down 3.8 percent compared to last Friday's close (as per UTC) of $6,890.  Other major names like litecoin, ethereum's ether, Ripple's XRP and bitcoin cash mimicked bitcoin's disappointing price action.  However, small caps like verge's XVG token, binance coin and OmiseGo's OMG token put on a good show to rank high on the list of gainers among top 25 cryptocurrencies by market cap. Meanwhile, names like ICON, IOTA and bitcoin gold (BTG) took something of a beating.  Weekly top gainers  Verge  Weekly performance: +50 percent  All-time high: $0.30  Closing price on March 30: $0.035945  Current market price: $ 0.054068  Rank as per market capitalization: 22  Despite the 29 percent pullback from the weekly high of $0.076482, verge's XVG token is reporting 50 percent gains on a weekly basis.  The token found bids last Friday, reportedly due to a successful crowdfunding campaign. The cryptocurrency then rose 66 percent on Tuesday on speculation the developers have entered into a partnership with a major retailer. However, the bull run ran out of steam on Wednesday after verge was hit by a hack.  Still, XVG looks set for a bullish move, as per the technical chart analysis. And with the developers set to reveal details of the rumored partnership on April 17, the token may remain well bid.  Binance coin  Weekly performance: +17.97 percent  All-time high: $22.48  Closing price on March 30: $10.35  Current market price: $12.21  Rank as per market capitalization: 16  Having defended the long-term ascending trendline (drawn from the Sept. 15 low and Nov. 30 low) last Friday, binance coin (BNB) turned higher over the weekend and jumped to $13.95 – the highest level since March 25.  The cryptocurrency had gained 28 percent in the first quarter, possibly due to hype around the launch of ""Binance Chain"" – its new decentralized exchange.  As of writing, BNB is changing hands at $12.27 on Binance. The rebound from the trendline support suggests the cryptocurrency will likely clear the immediate resistance $15.17 (March 24 high) in the next week or two.  OmiseGo  Weekly performance: +9.17 percent  All-time high: $28.35  Closing price on March 30: $8.28  Current market price: $9.04  Rank as per market capitalization: 20  OmiseGo (OMG) yesterday signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Shinhan Card, Korea's biggest credit card company – a move that could boost mass adoption in Asian markets. The news has received a thumbs up from the investor community and could be the reason behind OMG's 9 percent rise in the week ended April 6.  The daily chart (as per Bitfinex) indicates the token has breached the descending trendline (sloping downwards from the Feb. 28 high and March 21 high) confirming a short-term bullish trend reversal. However, prices are still trading below the high of $9.80 seen on April 3.  Weekly top losers  ICON  Weekly performance: -17.98 percent  All-time high: $12.04  Closing price on March 30: $2.28  Current market price: $1.87  Rank as per market capitalization: 23  ICON's ICX token tops the list of losers for the second week. The token fell to a five-day low of $1.82 on Binance, having clocked a high of $2.43 earlier this week. Investors seem to have taken heart from the fact that Chainsign, a blockchain-based contract platform developed by theloop (an ICON partner) and Cyberdigm, was used as a platform for the digital signing of an agreement with Seoul Fintech Lab.  That said, the cryptocurrency may make it to the list of losers next week, as the daily relative strength index and short-term moving average studies are aligned in favor of the bears.  IOTA  Weekly performance: -15.02 percent  All-time high: $5.69  Closing price on March 30: $1.11  Current market price: $0.943277  Rank as per market capitalization: 11  The IOTA-U.S. dollar exchange rate fell below $1.00 on April 1 for the first time since November, then slid further to $0.9150 today on Bitfinex – the lowest level since November 27.  While a few investors are cheering the news that Microsoft is set to invest $5 billion in the internet of things (an area for which IOTA is designed) over the next four years, the tech giant is not partnering with IOTA in any way.  The token could extend the drop further to $0.66 (Nov. 24 low) as prices seem to have found acceptance below support $0.94 (April 1 low).  Bitcoin gold  Weekly performance: -11.25 percent  All-time high: $484.78  Closing price on March 30: $44.55  Current market price: $39.54  Rank as per market capitalization: 24  There is not much love lost between bitcoin gold (BTG) and the crypto investor community. The cryptocurrency created via a hard fork of the bitcoin code in mid-November fell 83 percent in the first quarter and extended the decline by another 11 percent in the week ended April 6.  However, things might be looking up for BTG in the next couple of weeks, as the daily relative strength index shows oversold conditions.

In a statement posted to its website Friday, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), said that although it doesn't consider cryptocurrencies to be currencies or commodities for regulatory purposes, cryptocurrency derivatives may be financial instruments under current directives.  The statement said:  ""Firms conducting regulated activities in cryptocurrency derivatives must, therefore, comply with all applicable rules in the FCA’s Handbook and any relevant provisions in directly applicable European Union regulations.""  The FCA continued to explain that it's ""likely"" that companies seeking to offer derivatives linked to cryptocurrencies or tokens issued through ICOs will need to obtain authorization. The products mentioned include cryptocurrency futures, cryptocurrency contracts for differences (CFDs) and cryptocurrency options.  The agency added, however, that an ICO ""may or may not fall within the FCA’s regulatory purview depending on the nature of the tokens issued.""  The FCA finished with a warning that states: “If your firm is not authorized by the FCA and is offering products or services requiring authorization it is a criminal offence. Authorized firms offering these products without the appropriate permission may be subject to enforcement action.”  While the FCA has been generally positive on blockchain technology, saying in 2016 that it does not plan to regulate the blockchain industry for now as it believes it needs ""space"" to grow, it has taken a sterner stance on cryptocurrency and ICOs.  In December 2017, the head of the authority, Andrew Bailey, warned bitcoin investors to be prepared to ""lose all your money,"" adding the risks are similar to gambling.  The same month, the FCA announced that it would gather evidence and conduct a deeper examination on ICOs.

42380519,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gGI3,1523015725,How to Mount a Tax Defense for Unreported Crypto Income,"Phil Karter, a former Justice Department Tax Division trial lawyer, is currently a partner in the Philadelphia Office of Chamberlain Hrdlicka. Kevin F. Sweeney, a former federal tax prosecutor, is a senior counsel in the same office.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's Crypto and Taxes 2018 series.      On February 23, Coinbase, a popular U.S.-based digital currency exchange, notified 13,000 of its customers that it would be turning over their account information to the IRS. The notice was precipitated by a U.S. District Court ruling in a protracted John Doe Summons battle between the company and the IRS concerning accounts with potentially unreported cryptocurrency income.  Ultimately, the Court found that the IRS was entitled to the information.  The Coinbase summons battle is reminiscent of aggressive tax enforcement efforts pursued by the Department of Justice to ferret out U.S. taxpayers holding unreported income and assets abroad. That initiative also began with the issuance of a John Doe summons, but to a Swiss bank, UBS, for unreported foreign account information.  The IRS and DOJ then quickly expanded to other foreign banks and other countries. With the offshore voluntary disclosure program (“OVDP”) winding down, there are strong indications that the IRS will be turning its attention to unreported cryptocurrency transactions.  The vast majority of individuals with unreported cryptocurrency income have options available to mitigate and defend against civil penalties and criminal prosecution.  For those who received a Coinbase letter, the options are more limited; most will be audited and some will inevitably face the more drastic repercussions of a criminal investigation and prosecution.  Nonetheless, everyone with unreported cryptocurrency income must understand all the potential ramifications of their situation. Only then can they analyze and take appropriate action to make the most of a potentially bad situation.  Who is most at risk?  Although U.S. tax laws ostensibly operate on a system of “voluntary compliance,” the IRS and DOJ routinely seek to deter tax avoidance or evasion and coerce “voluntary compliance” by making examples of some non-compliant taxpayers.  For those who find themselves in that position, the risk of criminal investigation and prosecution is real.  Consequently, before taxpayers and their advisors decide on how to remediate and/or defend cryptocurrency related compliance issues, it is important to recognize where a particular taxpayer falls on the spectrum of civil versus criminal exposure.  The following categories of individuals with unreported cryptocurrency income should take particular caution:  Individuals who bought cryptocurrency with the proceeds of unlawful activities;  Individuals who accepted or converted other forms of currency into cryptocurrency to conceal income or assets from the IRS;  Individuals with substantial unreported cryptocurrency income and/or gains;  Individuals who derive all or most of their income from cryptocurrency (e.g., bitcoin miners); and  Individuals who will continue to stick their head in the sand and fail to bring their unreported cryptocurrency into tax compliance, as some unreported foreign accountholders still do.  How to defend a case?  As a preliminary matter, taxpayers and their advisors must avoid taking any action with the IRS until they have fully analyzed all of the civil and criminal risks.  The best practice is for an attorney with criminal tax experience to conduct this analysis either alone or with the assistance of an accountant under what’s known as a Kovel arrangement (in which the accountant acts as a kind of subcontractor to your lawyer and thus communications with the former are covered by attorney-client privilege). This will allow the tax advisors to learn the facts necessary to advise the taxpayer while protecting any sensitive communications.  If there is little to no criminal exposure, the taxpayer should consider filing a qualified amended return (QAR). Besides correcting the cryptocurrency reporting, the filing of a QAR has the added benefit of assisting taxpayers to avoid accuracy related penalties. However, anyone who is under audit or criminal investigation or is the subject of a John Doe Summons, such as the one issued to Coinbase, is precluded from filing a QAR.  Even if a taxpayer is disqualified from filing a QAR, he or she may still be able to avoid penalties by filing an amended return and establishing reasonable cause for noncompliance. But they should not do so lightly.  An inaccurate amended return is likely to increase, rather than decrease, one’s criminal exposure. In many cases, cryptocurrency exchanges have gone out of business, leaving taxpayers with a logistical records nightmare.  Although it may be theoretically possible to accurately trace transaction history through the blockchain ledger, such a process is beyond the sophistication level of most. At the same time, if a taxpayer guesstimates transaction data, or if his or her attempt to reconstruct records another way goes awry, the IRS may perceive these inaccuracies to be intentionally false items.  If a taxpayer’s criminal exposure is significant, he or she should seriously consider entering the domestic or offshore voluntary disclosure program, depending on where and how the unreported cryptocurrency was held. This approach is not likely to provide penalty relief but does offer an opportunity to avoid the more severe consequences of criminal prosecution.  For those who don’t qualify for a voluntary disclosure program or find themselves under criminal investigation or a sensitive civil audit headed that direction, fewer options are available. In these cases, the focus must shift from how to correct prior tax filings to protecting against a criminal conviction.  The government’s success in prosecuting tax related cryptocurrency cases will likely come down to its ability to identify and acquire records about taxpayers’ cryptocurrency holdings as well as evidence that their noncompliance was willful.  By responding to an IRS summons or subpoena for records or testimony, a taxpayer could assist the government in proving both. Consequently, it is important for taxpayers to proactively consult with experienced criminal tax counsel as soon as he or she receives notice of a criminal investigation or audit or has reason to believe one is imminent.  In some circumstances, that attorney may advise the taxpayer to assert his or her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination rather than providing the requested testimony or records.

According to Japanese daily The Mainichi, the deal will cost Monex 3.6 billion yen (around $33.5 million). Later this month, the broker will acquire 45.2 percent of Coincheck's shares from its founder and CEO Koichiro Wada, another 5.5 percent from board member Yusuke Otsuka and 49.3 percent from six other stakeholders, the report adds.  In an announcement Monex said:  ""The cryptocurrency exchange business plays a core part in a vision of “MONEX’s new beginning”. Therefore, the Company has resolved on 100% share acquisition of Coincheck who has been a pioneer among cryptocurrency exchangers.""  Once under Monex ownership, the broker said its senior executive officer Toshihiko Katsuya will take over as president of Coincheck, with Wada and Otsuka reportedly staying on at the firm in lower-level executive roles.  Monex said that Coincheck is in the process of improving its governance and internal controls after receiving an order from the Kanto Local Finance Bureau as a result of the hack that saw $530 million in NEM tokens stolen in January.  ""We aim to build a secured business environment for customers by fully backing up Coincheck's enhancement process,"" the announcement states.  Another report from Nikkei Asian Review indicates that Monex has aired plans to obtain regulatory approval for Coincheck, with the aim of a June relaunch. Monex was also cited as saying it hopes to hold an IPO of Coincheck shares at a future date – a move that would be a first for a Japanese cryptocurrency exchange.  The exchange is currently attempting to refund investors the majority of the funds stolen in the hack, and also faces several lawsuits over the heist.

42380521,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gGLp,1523010657,Bitcoin Eyes $6K After Key Resistance Fails to Hold,"Bitcoin (BTC) risks falling to $6,000 in the next 24 hours, but there is limited room for a drop below that level, the technical studies indicate.  BTC's retreat from the weekly high of $7,509 to $6,600 not only marks a failure on the bulls' part to hold prices above the key resistance of $7,240 (March 18 low), but also signals continuation of the bearish ""lower"" highs pattern (marked by hand signs) as seen on the chart below.  As of writing, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,565 on Bitfinex – down 3.9 percent from Thursday's close (as per UTC) of $6,769.  Daily chart  The third lower high (i.e. drop from $7,509 to $6,600) indicates the corrective rally has ended. However, only an acceptance under $6,425 (April 1 low) would establish the third lower low and open the doors for a drop to $6,000 (February low).  That said, the hourly chart and linear-scaled daily chart below do indicate the possibility of a drop below the key support.  Hourly chart  The downside break of the bearish pennant, a bearish continuation pattern, indicates the sell-off from $7,509 has resumed and prices could drop to $6,355 (target as per the measured height method, i.e. pole height subtracted from breakdown price).  Interestingly, the downside, as suggested by the bearish pennant breakdown, is very near to the falling channel support seen around $5,365 on the daily chart.  Additionally, BTC seems to have found acceptance below a key ascending trendline support.  Daily chart (linear scale)  BTC is trading well below the rising trendline (drawn from the July low and September low), which is bad news for the bulls. The trendline acted as strong support earlier this week. Also, the sell-off seen in February had run out of steam near the trendline support.  Clearly, the charts are aligned for a bearish move. However, a drop below $6,000 will likely push the daily relative strength index (RSI) below 30.00 (oversold territory) and could limit the sell-off. Note that the RSI currently stands at 32.80.  View  BTC looks set to clear the immediate support at $6,425 and drop towards $6,000 (February low).  A further drop towards $5,400–$5,300 cannot be ruled out, but will likely be short-lived, as the RSI will likely show oversold conditions by then.  Bearish invalidation scenario: On the higher side, a clear break above $6,938 (previous day's high), would add credence to previous day's doji candle and boost the odds of a move higher to the falling-channel resistance, currently seen around $7,580.

At block number 1546000 (08.20 UTC on Friday), the software upgrade of the cryptocurrency went live, according to data from blox.minexmr.com. Due to the controversial nature of the upgrade, the monero community have gathered on social media to observe its levels of adoption.  While monero hard forks are frequent, the current upgrade introduces a new consensus algorithm intended to protect the network from the emergence of ASIC mining hardware.  Announced by hardware supplier Bitmain last month, monero's rejection of the ASICs has led to several competing cryptocurrencies, including monero classic and monero original, that intend to preserve the former ASIC compatible software.  As such, the monero community is observing the hashrate, or speed of which the cryptocurrency is mined, in an attempt to gauge adoption.  Fluctuations in hashrate have caused some concerns on the monero subreddit, however, core developer ""hyc"" told CoinDesk, it will be ""a couple hours for us to see how the network overall hash rate settles out.""  Additionally, monero enthusiasts are observing the former chain and compiling lists of mining pools that have yet to upgrade.  The new upgrade will also increase monero’s ring size from 5 to 7, in an attempt to increase the robustness of the privacy tool, and protect against a deanonymization vector introduced by a further monero competitor, moneroV.

42380502,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gG2x,1523005216,"Most Cryptos Aren't Commodities, Defendants Claim in CFTC Case","Defendants from a cryptocurrency services company charged with fraud by the CFTC are pushing back against the the agency's assertion that cryptocurrencies are commodities.  In January, the CFTC charged My Big Coin Pay Inc, Randall Crater, Mark Gillespie and other associated parties with fraud and misappropriation of funds, alleging that they swindled more than $6 million from their customers through the sale of My Big Coins.  The CFTC subsequently sent a notice of ""supplemental legal authority"" to the defendants in March, after a judge in another case affirmed the commission's definition of cryptocurrencies as commodities.  On Tuesday, the defendants, excepting Gillespie, fired back in a filing opposing the CFTC's motion for a preliminary injunction against them. They argue that under the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and other regulations, cryptocurrencies only constitute commodities when futures contracts are dealt on them – as with bitcoin, for example.  ""While cryptocurrencies on which futures are dealt in are no doubt subject to CEA and CFTC Regulation,"" the filing reads, ""there are no futures on My Big Coin so it is not a commodity as that term is defined in the CEA and CFTC Regulations.""  It explains further:  ""As a virtual currency, with no physical or tangible existence, My Big Coin (and other virtual currencies) is not a 'good' or an 'article.' Instead, virtual currencies represent a set of 'services, rights and interests.' But, per the plain language of the CEA, intangible 'services, rights and interests' are only included in the CEA's definition of the term 'commodity' if there are futures contracts traded on them. The only virtual currency on which futures contracts are traded is bitcoin.""  The defendants' lawyers argue further that the CFTC's January notice of supplemental legal authority misinterpreted the aforementioned judge's decision, and that the judge acknowledged the ""futures requirement"" in his ruling.  In another notable development, recent filings show that Crater has hired a former senior trial attorney at the CFTC's Enforcement Division, Katherine Cooper.  In March, Cooper penned a blog post for the Blockchain Law Center considering the judge's affirmation of the CFTC's definition of cryptocurrencies as commodities, and outlined an argument similar to that of the defendants' filing.  She conjectured that the court's potentially contradictory definition of a commodity could be the result of it ""reasoning that if one virtual currency has a futures contract trading on it, then all other virtual currencies are 'goods ... in which contracts for future delivery are presently or in the future dealt in.'""  She closed her post with a now timely conclusion:  ""It remains to be seen then how a court would rule if it had the benefit of a robust, critical analysis of the CFTC's theory proffered on behalf of a defendant.""

42380520,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gGKZ,1523001650,Why Bitcoin Lightning Visualizers Aren't Quite What They Seem,"There's more to bitcoin's lightning network than meets the eye.  That said, data visualizations have become a favorite tool for bitcoin users eager to tell the story of the steady adoption of the in-development payments technology. Already, a ton of visualizers have been launched to depict the network in novel ways – from 3D renderings and historical time series to family trees and experimental animations.  Like blossoming clusters of galaxies, watching the nodes and channels unfurl into complicated webs has become somewhat of a sport for lightning fans.  ""I used to check the bitcoin price every day, but now I check the lightning network nodes every day,"" a lightning enthusiast wrote on Reddit, adding that unlike the price charts, lightning is always on an upward trend.  But according to several developers that work on lightning implementations, the images don't tell the whole story.  “Most of the snapshots will become increasingly irrelevant,” said Olaoluwa 'Laolu' Osuntokun, CTO and co-founder of Lightning Labs, which recently launched its lightning network implementation into public beta.  For one, the pictures are based on views from a single node, which has limited access to the entire lightning network.  “It isn't authoritative, not really indicative of the longer-term topology,” Osuntokun continued.  Nevertheless, the images right now play an important role, often deployed to solve unanswered questions about how the network is growing, namely whether lightning is fulfilling its (sometimes contested) promise of decentralization.  ""It gives people something they can point to to say, 'Look it's lightning!'"" Osuntokun said.  Pseudonymous developer ""Intel,"" who created the popular lightning mainnet explorer, #recksplorer, agreed, saying visualizers are the easiest way to observe the network growth at this point.  Intel continued:  “You can visually compare how they looked before and look now, making the network growth really noticeable. It's much more eye candy than sharing raw numbers of network nodes.”  A complete picture?  Still, according to Osuntokun, as the network continues to grow, these visual depictions will become more problematic.  While users have at times complained about the lack of visibility across the whole network, thinking it was due to faulty code, the partial view of the nodes is a necessary characteristic, as it enhances privacy and cuts down on individual node storage costs.  Plus, because of certain implementation parameters, if a channel has been inactive for more than two weeks or it contains a very small amount of funds, the channels might not be visible to all nodes. And finally, there could be nodes and channels that don’t announce themselves at all.  “It's actually optional for nodes to send out authenticated proofs attesting to the existence a channel,” Osuntokun said.  As such, even layering views from multiple nodes wouldn't give you a complete picture.  Tyzbit, the pseudonymous author of several interactive lightning visualizers, compared this to a dark, crowded room, with groups of people hidden behind others.  “You don't need to know about everyone in the room to send money to someone, you just need one working route,” tyzbit explained. “No one has a perfect picture of the network.”  But according to Osuntokun, while that could worry people that actually the lightning network isn't growing as fast as some suggest, it actually displays the more positive opposite.  Because on lightning, there’s no need for consensus, or, a global agreement of what the network is, it’s even possible that several, unconnected lightning networks could exist at once. With this in mind, it’s likely that lightning could be much bigger than depicted in the images.  He told CoinDesk:  ""An explorer should only be seen as a lower bound for the number of nodes or channels on the network.""  The end of visualizers  Still, visualizers may have a short shelf life anyway.  For one, Osuntokun said that as lightning adds more privacy features, visualizers will be unable to gather more specific data, like physical location, about the nodes. This is obviously a benefit for users since data about their location could expose them to attacks, but it's at the expense of the visual tools.  “As the graph gets larger and larger, visualizations will probably start to collapse channels into one another in order to reduce the dimensionality of the rendering,” Osuntokun said, “otherwise, things may just end up looking like a ball of yarn pretty soon.”  Intel echoed this point, stating that visualization software will eventually not be able to handle the amount of overlaps in the network.  “[A] large lightning network becomes like a tangled mess, and there is no way that you can untangle it for visualization purposes,” he said.  And this might be coming sooner than later. For instance, despite being labelled reckless for users to transact on the lightning network before Lightning Lab's March beta release, Intel's explorer saw rapid growth, reaching 1,337 nodes and 3,798 channels in a matter of weeks.  Even at its current size, the developer's explorer is already a bit unruly.  Because of that, Intel concluded:  “You can already see that happening on my explorer. The future of network visualizers is uncertain.”  Lightning network visualizer image via #recksplorer",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Rachel-Rose O'Leary,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/04/06/why-bitcoin-lightning-visualizers-arent-quite-what-they-seem,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dd42c91b68b177f0e3dd72b02368386f70ff6e97-2594x1584.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42428817,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLe7Rh,1522980078,"There's A Facebook Alternative, It's Called Self-Sovereign Identity","Kaliya “Identity Woman” Young is a co-founder of the Internet Identity Workshop and of HumanFirst.Tech and an independent expert on blockchain and identity systems who consults with governments, companies and startups.    This article was inspired by conversations with Tony Fish and Lubna Dajani.      Following the Cambridge Analytics election scandal, the meme #DeleteFacebook is widely circulating, leading to the next question, “what is the alternative?”  The answer isn’t a “new, better” platform – it’s an open standards-based infrastructure that centers on people and enables a whole new ecosystem to flourish.  Self-sovereign identity puts people in charge their own digital identities. It means that individuals have choice and sovereignty over their digital selves to the same degree we have control over our physical selves. This aligns with the fact that we all have inherent dignity that does not come from being born in a certain place or with certain attributes other than being human.  With self-sovereign identity, individuals don’t rely on another party, such as Facebook, to issue them an identifier for their use. They create the identifiers and own and control them along with what information is shared with whom under what conditions.  Under the status quo, where we don’t own and control our own identifiers, we are subject to the the terms of another party, whether this is a corporation (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter etc) or a government. These actors have a role to play in the identity ecosystem, but the new self-sovereign identity tools will shift the power balance.  The large organizations will be in service to, and in a relationship with, the individual rather than the individual being subject to them.  Figuring out how individuals can collect, store, manage and present their own identity information and personal data via their own devices, and with services they control, is a challenge I have been working on my entire professional career. Below I explain the key technical breakthroughs that, when combined, make self-sovereign identity possible today in a way that was not possible five years ago.  Hierarchy namespace  Up until now, the only way to anchor identifiers for yourself on the internet was to do so within a hierarchical name space.  For example, in a private name space, you are under a company’s terms of service. It can terminate your digital identity at any time for any reason and you have virtually no legal recourse.  Such is the case for Google email addresses, Twitter handles, Facebook accounts, LinkedIn profiles, Instagram accounts, and pretty much any site where you create a username and password that then lives under the other party’s name space and control.  Then there are globally hierarchical namespaces. There are many of these; two common ones are IP addresses managed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and the domain name system managed by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). These work together to give you the website addressing system.  You can buy a domain name from a company like GoDaddy and pay $10 to $15 a year to have a name in that namespace you “own” within the global DNS name system. In the global phone number system, you can get a number from your phone company.  In both cases, you rent your identifier. Don’t pay your bill for 30 days, or fail to renew your domain name next year, and the number will be given to, or the domain name can be bought by, someone else.  An alternative is to build a global name space just for people. This seemed like a reasonable path more than a decade ago but it never took off.  A company originally called OneName tried to do this. It changed its name Cordance and tried to launch iNames in partnership with Neustar in 2006. The company rebranded their product again as CloudNames in 2013. (For CoinDesk readers experiencing deja vu: the OneName handle had a second life as the original name for Blockstack.)  Today, however, have the possibility of real self-sovereign identity rooted in identifiers not under the control of another entity but truly controlled by the individual.  Decentralized identifiers  The first challenge is to make such identifiers globally unique, globally resolvable and recognizable.  The Decentralized Identifiers specification, developed under the auspices of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), is the basis of the solution. It outlines the format for the identifiers along with that of DID descriptor objects (DDOs), the documents containing all the metadata needed to prove control and ownership of an identifier.  This gets a bit nerdy, so bear with me. The DDO includes:  DID (self-describing)  List of public keys (for the owner)  List of controlling DIDs (for key recovery)  List of service endpoints (for interaction). This is the heart of how one builds new tools and services around the individual and puts personally identifiable information (PII) under their control.  Timestamps (for audit history)  Digital signature with the private key (this ensures integrity)  There are several varieties of DID and different methods but they all follow this same basic outline.  Shared ledgers  So we now that have a way to create globally unique identifiers, where are they stored? And how do people access them?  Shared ledgers (better known as distributed ledgers or blockchains) are the innovation that has made this possible.  These are networks of computers that keep in sync with each other, maintaining one global ledger or database that is mirrored and replicated across thousands of machines. Entries in the database are periodically (every one to ten minutes, depending on the particulars) cryptographically “sealed” so that they are practically impossible to change.  So when you create a DID and store it in a shared ledger, it can’t, for all intents and purposes, be erased. It can only be updated by you or your agents.  Now we have a globally resolvable yet distributed namespace. Next we need to add security in the form of cryptographic keys.  Public and private keys  How do you prove that you own a particular DID? Good old public key infrastructure (PKI).  For the uninitiated: Public and private keys are mathematically related but different numbers. Public keys can be revealed to the world, while private keys should be kept secret so only the keyholder can see and use it.  Say I want to send you a message so only you can open it. I take your public key (which has a special mathematical relationship to your private key), my public key and my private key and I use those three numbers to scramble the message. Then I send the scrambled blob over to you.  You then take my public key, your public key and your private key and use all three of those numbers to unscramble the message. This is the basis of creating secure communication channels for everything.  The shared ledger infrastructure for DIDs and DDOs allows for finding public keys which need to be findable.  So now we’ve figured out how to have globally unique, user-owned digital identifiers at scale with the ability to control and secure them. But can we have unique identifiers for each of our relationships with different entities?  Directed identifiers  In today’s broken identity system, the use of the same number across many locations links all of your activities together.  These globally unique “use it everywhere identifiers” issued by governments – e.g. Social Security numbers in the U.S. or Aadhaar numbers in India – have created massive vulnerabilities and privacy issues.  Just knowing information about a person allows you to take action “as” that person. Gathering sufficient information to do this is almost trivial. Names and dates of birth are publicly available, while Social Security numbers are widely shared, both legitimately and on the black market, where hackers auction the spoils of data breaches.  But now, using the DID infrastructure, individuals and institutions can create globally unique and single-use identifiers that, through PKI, allow for secure communication channels between the individual and the institution.  So if, say, your bank’s database is compromised and your private key there is exposed, then only that one account is affected. The private key is useless anywhere else – unlike a Social Security number today. The institution can also establish new public and private keys and a new secure connection with you.  This technology does not stop data breaches but it does reduce the impact because each relationship has its own unique identifiers rather than one identifier used across multiple contexts.  Now we’ve got the underlying infrastructure which the user does not touch. Next, we need services.  Mobile apps and cloud services  In our new system, each individual has hundreds if not thousands of unique identifiers for many different relationships with people, applications and service providers. Sounds like a nightmare to keep track of, but fortunately software can work on the end-user’s behalf to manage all these keys.   There will be companies that provide the applications and cloud services for this. However, the power will be in the hands of the individual to change between various service providers.  Additionally, people can still delegate data management to trusted agents – it could be a teenager’s parents, an elderly person’s adult children, or someone’s attorney or accountant.  The ultimate control is with the individual (or the individual’s agent), who always has the ability to change providers of this service just like we always have the ability to withdraw our money from one bank and use a different bank to store our savings.  In this setup, we give people the power to manage lots of relationships in a very secure manner.  Verifiable claims  So with all these distributed and decentralized identifiers, how do we know about key information that is relevant to particular transactions and comes from other parties?  Entities that have authoritative knowledge of a claim about you can issue a verifiable claim and record they have done so in a distributed ledger. One example of a verifiable claim is date of birth – that is a fact that your parents register with the government, perhaps before you even come home from the hospital. The county or state where you are born has a register of all births and issues birth certificates based on the claims in that registry or ledger.  It is possible for the state to zap a digital claim (the equivalent of the information on a birth certificate) to someone’s mobile app. That person can then go on to use the claim in other contexts with entities that ask for a date of birth.    Other verified claims could include a license to drive, an educational credential like a degree or something super-specific like passing one particular class, or proof you are an employee at a particular company. The standards for how to do this are moving through the W3C in the Verifiable Claims Working Group and the Credentials Community Group.    Now you can have both distributed decentralized identifiers and provability of key assertions, claims or attributes.  The ‘phone home’ problem  In the past, any solution to the verifiable claim problem involved the verifier checking in with the issuer about whether it actually issued said claim. This is known as the “phone home” problem.  To put this in concrete terms: you want to get a drink at a bar. In today’s world, the bartender looks at your driver’s license and generally believes the date of birth (unless it’s an obvious fake). But if it were a digital license, how can he “believe” it? He’d have to “phone home” to the state to check if the digital assertion that you are over 21 is true.  This is not something you want to have happen – because then the state would know all the places you used your digital verified claim. In other words, Big Brother knows where you are drinking and when.  But suppose instead that proof of claim issuance by the issuer is stored in a distributed public ledger that is discoverable by the verifier. Thus the verifier can establish the veracity of the claim and that it came from the issuer, without actually interacting with said issuer.  Just when you think that must be it, there is more. We now need to prove a claim without revealing a secret.  Zero-knowledge proofs  How do you prove a claim is true and not share all the information in it?  Returning to the bar example, how do you prove you are over the age of 21 and therefore allowed to buy alcohol but not give away your complete birthdate (or, for that matter, your name and address, which are also displayed on a physical photo ID)?  Fancy math makes cryptographic proofs really quite easy. When a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) claim is issued to the individual claimant, he or she can re-present the claim to the verifier, who can believe it because of how it was cryptographically encoded.  You can use verified claims to share some, but not all, aspects of a claim from an issuer. This preserves privacy for the individual because not all information is shared with the verifier, who can still trust the claim’s veracity.  Not all proofs last forever, though. There are special cases and we need the power to revoke claims.  Claim revocation  Zero knowledge proofs have been around for awhile and they work really well for the type of claim that can’t be revoked like one’s birth date (the state doesn’t come back and say “you were not born”).  However, they don’t work well for claims that do have revocation involved. For example, you are currently an employee of a particular company, but you might not be this time next year.  This in the past has been impossible to tell from a ZKP – if one was issued there was no way to tell if it had been revoked without Phoning Home, which for whole classes of claims made it kind of useless. Because knowing if something is true now, not if it was true in the past, is a key part of the claim.  TheCL Proof is an even fancier bit of math that complements the ZKP. CL gives issuers the power to revoke claims and for verifiers to see those revocations even if they are ZKPs. So now you can use ZKPs for a wider range of claims.  Summary  When brought together, all of these breakthroughs mean that a self-sovereign identity system is possible now.  It is worth noting this term is relatively new; when I began on this path 15 years ago we used to call the goal we were working toward “user-centric identity.”  This new, open-standards infrastructure lays a real foundation for a new layer of the internet that will replace Facebook. A new layer where people own and control their own identities and connect to any number of tools and services under their own terms. All of the folks thinking about backing or funding alternatives to Facebook need to build on the self-sovereign identity infrastructure.  It is gratifying to see the community of individuals who have been steadfastly gathering twice a year for over 13 years at the Internet Identity Workshop succeed in making this vision a reality.
