18460554,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554447,1696633255,Solana Enhances Privacy Offerings As SOL’s Uptrend Persists With 4% Gains,"Solana (SOL), a layer 1 proof-of-stake blockchain, has introduced version 1.16, which enhances user privacy through “Confidential Transfers.” This update includes encrypted Solana Program Library (SPL) token transactions, ensuring confidentiality rather than anonymity. The adoption of version 1.16 by Solana’s network of validators has reached a majority after ten months of development and an audit by Halborn, a blockchain security firm. Solana Labs Rolls Out Privacy-Enhancing Update According to the announcement made by Solana’s infrastructure provider Helius, The update has undergone rigorous testing, with v1.16 running on testnet since June 7, 2023. Volunteer and canary nodes have reportedly played a crucial role in identifying and resolving issues during the testing phase. Solana Labs has also deployed canary nodes on mainnet-beta to monitor the stability of v1.16 under real-world conditions. Related Reading: Chainlink To Go “Parabolic” After Breaking 28-Month Downtrend? Solana employs a feature gate system to prevent consensus-breaking changes, ensuring that validators running older versions do not fork off the canonical chain. What’s more, Consensus-breaking changes now require a Solana Improvement Document (SIMD) and greater transparency through documentation. Confidential Transfers, introduced by Token2022, utilize zero-knowledge proofs to encrypt balances and transaction amounts of SPL tokens, prioritizing user privacy. Looking ahead, Solana Labs plans to adopt a more agile release cycle, targeting smaller releases approximately every three months. Room For Growth According to a Nansen report, Solana has witnessed a significant surge in its Total Value Locked (TVL) throughout this year, nearly doubling since the beginning of 2023, and currently boasting a TVL of 30.95 million SOL. Monthly transactions on the Solana network have remained relatively stable, with an increase in vote transactions, encompassing both vote and non-vote transactions. Furthermore, Nansen highlights that Solana has implemented innovative solutions such as state compression and isolated fee markets to address prominent issues within its tech stack. One notable solution, state compression, has substantially reduced the cost of non-fungible token (NFT) minting on Solana more than 2,000 times. State Compression Unleashes Affordable NFT Minting For instance, the cost of minting 1 million NFTs before the introduction of state compression would have amounted to approximately $253,000. In contrast, with state compression enabled, the cost is significantly reduced to just $113. In comparison, minting a similar collection size on Ethereum would cost approximately $33.6 million, and on Polygon, it would amount to around $32,800. Furthermore, the liquid staking landscape on Solana is experiencing rapid growth, with leading platforms like Marinade Finance, Lido Finance, and Jito taking the forefront. Related Reading: Ripple Vs. SEC: Crypto CEO Predicts SEC Will Drop Charges Against Executives However, despite this growth, the current amount of staked SOL in Solana’s liquid staking protocols accounts for less than 3% of the total staked SOL, indicating substantial room for expansion. It is worth noting that the report by Nansen raises concerns about the uncertainty surrounding FTX/Alameda’s SOL holdings, as FTX holds over 71.8 million SOL, representing approximately 17% of the circulating supply and 13% of the total supply. While this situation may present temporary risks to Solana’s growth trajectory, it is essential to monitor its impact closely. On the other hand, the native token of the protocol, SOL, continues to exhibit substantial gains across all timeframes. The token is trading at $23.68, reflecting an increase of over 4% in the past 24 hours.

The analysis marks a return of this trend, which could see XRP rise as high as $1,000. The 39-Month Cycle Pseudonymous crypto analyst NeverWishing on TradingView has presented a rather convincing 39-month cycle trend that often ends with the XRP price seeing a significant rise. The last time this trend was completed was back in mid-2020 just before the 2020/2021 bull market began. When this trend was marked three years ago, it ended with the XRP price rallying from $0.17 in June to $2 in April 2021. Since then, another 39-month cycle began counting and once again, it has reached the point where a surge usually occurs. In the chart presented by NeverWishing, the expected price jump this time around will be less like the 2020-2021 trend and more like the 2017-2018 jump. In 2017 when the 39-month cycle jump took place, XRP went from $0.005 to $3.3 at its peak, meaning a 66,000% jump in price. However, the analyst expects even more explosive growth with the XRP price going from around $0.53 to $1,000 by the time the rally is complete. This means a more than 188,000% rise from the current price levels. XRP nosedive to $0.51 as bears take control | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com When Will The XRP Price Reach $1,000? The previous 39-month cycle jumps outlined by the crypto analyst both hit their peak a little less than a year later. The 2017-2018 rally was 11 months and the 2020-2021 rally was 10 months, so it is expected that it will stick close to this timeframe this time around. NeverWishing’s chart shows the rally starting in November and hitting $2 in the next four months. From then on, there are multiple important price levels outlined including $16 by the end of April 2024 and $118 by June 2024. Roadmap to $1,000 | Source: Tradingview.com Then for the grand prize of $1,000, the crypto analyst sets a target date for December 2024, around 13 months from the rally’s start. So if this prediction does come to pass, the XRP price could be trading between $869-$1,000 in a little over a year. The 39-month cycle trend looks similar to the four-year Bitcoin cycle. However, unlike Bitcoin whose four-year cycle is characterized by the infamous halving event, the XRP 39-month cycle does not have a significant event. Instead, it looks to just follow work mainly on a timeframe basis. Nevertheless, some recent developments could lend credence to a bull rally such as Ripple’s multiple wins over the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) just this year alone. Additionally, Ripple has been expanding its footprint globally as it looks to take a big chunk of the payments sector for itself.

42409596,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcLYKO,1696628198,FloorDAO Sends $2.5M to Splinter Group After Months of Fighting Over Financial Commitments,"NFT finance-focused crypto group FloorDAO “forked” into two separate entities this week in an effort to shake off FLOOR token investors who disagreed with the project's direction – and its abandonment of its arbitrage-friendly roots.  FloorDAO, which seeks to build products for “NFT-Fi,” recently sent over $2.5 million of its treasury – in crypto tokens and NFTs – to a splinter group called FloorkDAO that was controlled by activist investors and comprised of dozens of disaffected holders who opted to join their exodus. The splinter group quickly initiated a redemption that paid nearly $5 per FLOOR, close to this year's high water mark for the struggling asset, which is currently trading at $3.88.  The exodus is the culmination of months of internal battles over FloorDAO's commitment to its obligations to investors in its FLOOR token. The project is a spinoff of Olympus DAO, the once-mighty protocol that pioneered a new way of raising cash, issuing tokens, and managing project treasuries.  That lineage meant FloorDAO's native token shouldn't be falling below the value of its treasury, a.k.a its ""book value."" The project's original documentation reflected this, stating that if it were ever to happen then the ""theoretical arbitrage"" could be closed by the DAO's disillusion and asset distribution.  When FLOOR's price inevitably fell below book value, however, this theory failed to follow through. Project insiders pledged last year to introduce a redemption mechanism that would fix the hole in FLOOR's floor, according to Discord records and longtime investors who spoke to CoinDesk. But somewhere along the line they abandoned their promise and instead planned a protocol upgrade that stripped token-holders of voting power and their rights to the treasury.  Before this ""v2"" upgrade took effect a subset of FLOOR's community began rallying against it. They demanded the project let them exit the DAO and get their share of the treasury ahead of the upgrade, which they saw as an abandonment of the project's roots and its future promises. Holders routinely demanded through votes that the project conduct buybacks of their tokens instead of buying more NFTs for the treasury.  FloorDAO's insiders ultimately conceded that the disaffected bloc had grown so powerful that the project had no choice but to split. A vote earlier this year cleared the way for FloorDAO to splinter into two groups: one that would retain the name and the focus on NFTs, and another, called FloorkDAO, that any fed-up investor could join as an escape hatch.  FloorkDAO highlights the growing strength of activist investors within decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs. Projects that struggled to find product-market-fit or maintain their asset's ""book value"" have faced pressure this year from investors to buy them out, rather than keep spending their treasury.  This is possible because many DAOs treat their issued tokens as governance chips; the more chips one has, the more say they get in the DAO’s decision-making. Arbitrage investors have been known to buy tokens trading below ""book value"" and then lobby for mechanisms that allow them to cash out – hence the activist tilt.  Project insiders tend to see their coordination as an attack against the DAO. “FloorDAO has now successfully forked to allow members who are not aligned with the long-term vision of the DAO to exit,” a blog post from earlier this week said.  But the activist investors see themselves as protecting their positions, as well as the interests of all token holders who join them in rage quitting. Those who spoke to CoinDesk said FloorDAO's false promise to implement redemptions laid the groundwork for the exodus.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TRADING | FORKS,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/10/06/activist-crypto-investors-score-25m-bounty-after-campaign-on-floordao,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ceea862ce3aeb50592f401987a6b3f6c6ad05d1d-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

18457157,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554454,1696626017,"Bitcoin Price Projection Soars: BTC-Gold Ratio Indicator Proposes $120,000 Price Target","Over the past week, Bitcoin price has displayed a notable bullish momentum. This comes after a prolonged consolidation phase during which the leading cryptocurrency remained stagnant below the $27,000 mark for an entire month. However, with the recent breakout and the resurgence of bullish sentiment in the market, experts are now predicting a potential surge that could propel Bitcoin’s price above $30,000. Bitcoin Price Bullish Momentum Continues Technical analyst Gert Van Lagen highlights a significant breakout from a long-term descending channel, signifying the end of a corrective wave and paving the way for a parabolic surge in Wave 5. Gert Van Lagen emphasizes the monumental breakout of a 2.25-year descending channel, marking the end of an expanded flat corrective wave 4. The channel, determined by the green dots, has contained the ABC correction of wave 4. With wave five on the horizon, breaking 10% above the channel, around $30,000, is expected to trigger a parabolic surge. Related Reading: Bitcoin News: Here Is When BTC Could Revisit $20,000 One Last Time, Analyst Says Notably, Gert believes that wave 5, a “blow-off wave,” may exhibit steep growth, with the final impulse indicating a significant upward movement. While the potential for further upside gains is promising, remaining aware of key considerations and potential invalidation points is crucial. In this context, paying attention to $13,800 would be essential, as the invalidation point lies when wave four falls below wave 1. Bitcoin-Gold Ratio Indicator Prominent figures in the crypto analytics industry, the co-founders of Glassnode, have expressed their belief in Bitcoin’s potential to reach six figures. Drawing attention to the BTC-Gold ratio, they suggest that Bitcoin could rise to approximately 98 times the price of Gold. The BTC-Gold ratio serves as a critical metric for understanding the relative performance and value of Bitcoin compared to Gold. Analyzing this ratio, the Glassnode analysts note several positive indicators suggesting a Bitcoin price surge. The rising RSI (Relative Strength Index) and its position above 50 indicate increasing buying pressure and positive momentum. Additionally, the bullish MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) crossover and a rising trend reinforce the bullish sentiment surrounding Bitcoin. Using Fibonacci extensions provides further insight into potential price levels for Bitcoin. These extensions, derived from mathematical ratios, are often used to identify price targets during upward trends. Related Reading: Is Ethereum’s Staking Boom A Ticking Time Bomb? JPMorgan Weighs In Based on the analysis, the Fibonacci extensions suggest that Bitcoin could reach valuation levels around $120,000, while Gold maintains a price of around $1,200. The Glassnode co-founders’ analysis fuels optimism within the crypto community. Bitcoin’s potential for six-figure valuations could attract more investors and solidify its status as a digital store of value. The predicted surge in Bitcoin’s price would likely have a ripple effect, generating increased interest and investment in the broader cryptocurrency market. When writing, BTC is trading at $27,900, just below the significant psychological level of $28,000. This level currently represents a crucial threshold for bearish sentiment towards BTC. BTC must maintain support at the $27,000 level to sustain its bullish momentum. By surpassing the current resistance line at its current trading level, BTC can reclaim the $30,000 mark and set its sights on the annual high of $31,800. This upward movement could position the cryptocurrency to challenge the 1-year resistance level at $39,000, with the potential for consolidation above the $40,000 mark.

42409597,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcLYUJ,1696622583,What Happened During Sam Bankman-Fried's First Week in Court?,"The first few days of Sam Bankman-Fried’s trial have not been going in his favor, general consensus seems to suggest. Prosecutors for the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) are establishing the case that the FTX founder was deeply involved in a long-term scheme to defraud customers and investors, throwing a wrench in the fallen crypto mogul’s legal defense that, while nominally in charge, he was oblivious to the rot taking shape at his exchange FTX and hedge fund Alameda Research.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Bankman-Fried always faced an uphill battle in this much-watched trial. Published documents and allegations made by FTX’s current leadership, under the direction of Enron’s bankruptcy lead John Jay Ray III, as well as SBF’s ill-conceived “apology tour” following shortly after FTX closed shop have tainted public perception of the once beloved crypto savant. “SBF is going to be the victim of his own success,” Renato Mariotti, partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner LLP who is watching the case, said on CoinDesk TV.  And his “tough, tough, tough case” doesn’t seem to be made any easier in the courtroom by defense attorneys with Cohen & Gresser. It’s been widely reported that District Judge Lewis Kaplan has appeared visibly annoyed by Bankman-Fried’s high-paid lawyers. Some on-lookers said during some attempts at cross-examination, “80%” of defense attorney Chris Everdell’s questions were shot down. In fact, prosecutors’ objection to misleading questions became so routine, Judge Kaplan at times sustained an objection before it was offered.  See also: Could Sam Bankman-Fried's Saga Happen Without Crypto? | Opinion  But it’s early days yet, in a trial that could last six weeks. It’s still unknown whether Bankman-Fried, sporting a new haircut, will testify. Mariotti, along with a seeming majority of lawyers, said that would be a gamble at best and like disastrous. Gary Wang, FTX co-founder and longtime friend to SBF, already admitted to committing fraud on the stand, referencing the “special privileges” offered to trading shop Alameda on FTX. While a ex-FTX developer Adam Yedidia said he quit in November 2022 after learning of the scheme to “defraud” customers, a strong point that was stricken from the record.  Here is a roundup of CoinDesk coverage — pulling out the major highlights and details — of the trial so far, and events happening outside the courtroom like revelations from Michael Lewis’ confounding biography of Bankman-Fried.  FTX co-founder Gary Wang took the stand Thursday — the Department of Justice's fourth witness — and admitted the crypto exchange gave ""special privileges” to SBF's hedge fund Alameda Research to allow it to withdraw unlimited funds. Wang also testified FTX and Alameda execs, including Caroline Ellison and Nishad Singh, knowingly committed wire fraud, securities fraud and commodities fraud.  Venture firm Paradigm has ""marked"" its $278 million investment into FTX ""to zero dollars,"" co-founder Matt Huang said during the SBF trial.  A 2022 software bug that resulted from the unusual way FTX handled customer deposits overstated Alameda holdings by $8 billion, according to testimony from Adam Yedidia. FTX customers deposited fiat by wiring money to Alameda, ex-FTX dev Yedidia said, which ""complicated"" how the companies tracked debts owed to customers.  Two luxury jets apparently owned by Sam Bankman-Fried (but reportedly never used by him) could be forfeited, as U.S. prosecutors continue to claw back assets. In a late Wednesday filing, a forfeiture bill issued by the DOJ listed two aircraft — a Bombardier Global and Embraer Legacy — as assets belonging to Bankman-Fried it is looking to seize.  SBF changed the lock up period of SRM tokens after a massive rally in 2021, because he was concerned his employees would get too rich to work, according to Michael Lewis' biography ""Going Infinite."" “In the fine print of the employee Serum contract, he’d reserved for himself the right to extend Serum’s jail time, and he used it to lock up all employees’ Serum for seven years,” Lewis wrote.  A physician’s assistant, a librarian, a nurse and nine others were picked as the jury that will ultimately decide if Sam Bankman-Fried committed fraud. Throughout the week, reporters and on-lookers have said the jury at times appears bored by the trial, with at least one juror reportedly nodding off.  In its opening statement Wednesday, U.S. prosecutors called SBF’s crypto empire a “house of cards ... built on a lie.” Lying has become a repeated refrain during the trial, with FTX co-founder Gary Wang also saying SBF has “lied” about Alameda’s ability to rack up debt and leverage, putting FTX customer funds at risk.  SBF’s lawyers, largely deemed ineffective in the early days of the trial, have focused on SBF’s “good faith” actions as they work to establish the argument that a mistake in business – even a colossal one like misplacing $8 billion – is not necessarily a crime.  The Department of Justice said the absence of clear crypto regulations is not relevant to its criminal suit of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, a point Judge Kaplan seemingly agrees with.  Alameda Research lost almost all $170 million raised in its first funding round, backed primarily by “effective altruists,” according to Michael Lewis’s biography of Sam Bankman-Fried “Going Infinite.” Its high-frequency trading strategies were iffy apart from an arbitrage strategy to buy cheap bitcoin in the U.S. and sell it for profit in Japan. Alameda reportedly lost over $500,000 every day during one particular month.  Sam Bankman-Fried sued his insurance provider, CNA, for allegedly failing to pay legal costs linked to his defense against fraud allegations. His legal complaint referenced a dozen civil and regulatory actions relating to his collapsed crypto exchange FTX, making clear his legal bills are mounting.  Former FTX spokesman Kevin O’Leary said the era “crypto cowboys” is over as the industry shifts to being regulated, on CoinDesk TV. According to ""Going Infinite,"" the Canadian TV personality was paid $15.7 million by FTX for “20 service hours, 20 social posts, one virtual lunch and 50 autographs,” though not all FTX executives, including Constance Wang, saw the value in the relationship. SBF reportedly said it was “shocking” but “true” that people listen to O’Leary for financial advice.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | RESEARCH,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/10/06/what-happened-during-sam-bankman-frieds-first-week-in-court,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2157af549472a0ac9d54a6fa87504a8ddfc39661-1819x1023.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Crypto markets rebounded after blowout U.S. employment data, led by AVAX and SOL.  BTC eschewed its correlation with long-duration bonds and equities, bringing back its ""digital gold"" narrative, one analyst said.  Bitcoin (BTC) is once again flirting with key resistance at $28,000 on Friday as crypto and traditional markets rebounded from early losses caused by stronger-than-expected U.S. employment data.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization slid nearly 2% to below $27,300 on news that the U.S. economy added 336,000 jobs in September, almost doubling economist expectations. The losses were short-lived, however, with bitcoin quickly rebounding to just above $28,000.

Alongside, U.S. stocks recovered from sharp early losses, with the Nasdaq sporting a 1.75% advance shortly before the close of Friday trade.  Ether (ETH) halted its losing streak against BTC, outperforming the market and bouncing nearly 2%. The second largest crypto asset was changing hands at $1,650 during afternoon hours.  Layer 1 network Avalanche’s AVAX and Solana’s SOL led the market rebound among major altcoins, gaining 6% and 3.8%, respectively.  What’s next for bitcoin’s price?  Both the 200-day moving average and the 200-week moving average lie at around $28,000, acting as heavy resistance for any price increase, Rachel Lin, CEO of derivatives decentralized exchange SynFutures, said in an email.  “Therefore, bitcoin is witnessing strong selling every time it reaches that zone,” Lin said. “A sustained break above $28,100 would be a positive sign and could lead Bitcoin to $30,000.”  Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock, noted Friday in a market report that bitcoin has been acting differently during the recent bond sell-off compared to last year.  “Many of the catalysts that brought BTC down in 2022 are no longer doing so,” Outumuro said.  He explained that when the Federal Reserve jacked up interest rates last year, the value of long-duration bonds tanked, putting pressure on risk assets like bitcoin. As the pace of rate hikes slowed and speculation began about a Fed pivot earlier this year, long-duration bonds and BTC rallied.  Now, the relationship between the two assets has flipped, with bitcoin heading higher even as long-term bond price craters.  “The market appears to be reevaluating bitcoin's value proposition amid global uncertainty,” Outumuro said.  “Bitcoin's recent price stability during the bond and equity sell-off highlights its growing status as an independent asset class,” Michael Silberberg, head of investor relations at crypto hedge fund AltTab Capital, told CoinDesk in an email. “This decoupling marks a further evolution towards bitcoin’s ‘digital gold’ narrative.”  “If it persists in trading in a tight range while stocks and bonds sell-off, it will solidify this narrative and likely attract more institutional inflows seeking uncorrelated assets,” Silberberg added. “We expect this new maturity could mark the start of a long-term bull trend over the next 4-6 months.”",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/06/bitcoin-grapples-with-28k-resistance-but-uncorrelated-asset-allure-could-mean-higher-prices-says-analyst,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/184bec27bc119fb2ad293abf03f90147341281fb-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

18454259,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554440,1696618812,Is Ethereum’s Staking Boom A Ticking Time Bomb? JPMorgan Weighs In,"Ethereum (ETH), a forerunner in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, has seen a notable surge in its staking activities. This staking boom has raised eyebrows among experts from JPMorgan concerned over ETH’s increase in centralization and the consequences that may arise. Ethereum, aiming to transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, opened the floodgates for staking. This meant holders could ‘stake’ or lock their tokens to support network operations like block validation. However, while this promises rewards for the stakers, JPMorgan analysts have reported that there could be ripple effects. Related Reading: Whales Abandon Ship? Ethereum’s Value In Jeopardy As Major Holders Liquidate Ethereum Centralization Concerns Rise To The Surface JPMorgan analysts, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, highlight the inadvertent increase in Ethereum’s network centralization, particularly post the Merge and Shanghai upgrades. The Ethereum network became “more centralized as the overall staking yield declined,” they noted. According to the analysts, what’s leading to this centralization could be attributed to liquid staking providers. Lido, a notable player, has been pinpointed for its dominant role. The JPMorgan report noted: The top 5 liquid staking providers control more than 50% of staking on the Ethereum network, and Lido specifically accounts for almost one-third. The analysts further disclosed while platforms such as Lido tote their decentralized nature, the underlying reality appears different. The analysts said these platforms “involve a high degree of centralization.” According to the analysts, the ramifications of such centralization can’t be understated. They mentioned that “a concentrated number of liquidity providers or node operators” might compromise the network’s integrity, leading to potential points of failure, attacks, or even conspiracy, resulting in an “oligopoly.” They further highlighted that such centralized entities could censor or exploit user transactions, undermining the community’s interests. The Rehypothecation Risk And Declining Rewards Another dimension to the staking story is the looming threat of ‘rehypothecation.’ In simple terms, it’s the act of leveraging staked assets as collateral across various DeFi platforms. According to the JPMorgan’s analysts: Rehypothecation could then result in a cascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value or is hacked or slashed due to a malicious attack or a protocol error. Furthermore, as Ethereum continues its journey on the staking path, the staking rewards seem to diminish. The report indicated a drop in total staking yield from 7.3% before the Shanghai upgrade to roughly 5.5% recently.

However, the short term remains uncertain; the cryptocurrency continues to trade in a tight range, although BTC has shown a spike in volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Is Showing Early Signs of Fresh Drop, $27,200 Is The Key As of this writing, the Bitcoin price trades at $25,500 with a 2% loss in the last 24 hours. In the previous seven days, the cryptocurrency maintained some of its profits as most of the tokens in the top 10 by market cap traded in the red after experiencing a slight uptick. Bitcoin News: BTC At Risk Of Topping For Remaining Of The Year The bigger picture for Bitcoin leans to the upside with the approval of a BTC spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in the US gaining momentum. However, analyst Rekt Capital believes current prices are similar to those in late 2019 and early 2020. As the chart below shows, at that time, the price of Bitcoin was trending to the upside in a tight triangle with a top at around $10,000. The cryptocurrency eventually broke about this resistance and entered uncharted territory. As the chart shows, this scenario has some obstacles for optimistic investors. Before the breakout, the price of Bitcoin revisited the lows and event wicked below critical support at $3,250. The analyst believes that BTC could display similar price action as it approaches the top of its current channel. In this scenario, which aligns with BTC’s pre-halving behavior, the cryptocurrency could re-visit the low of the trend. As a result, a return to $20,000 and even the $15,000 lows seems likely. The analyst stated: Here’s the thing about current prices. Right now, there’s a risk of them representing the Top for 2023. But after the Halving, these same exact prices will represent a Re-Accumulation range (red) before lift-off into a Parabolic Uptrend (green). Still Hope For BTC Price Bulls As mentioned, this scenario could hint at short-term losses for BTC, but the analyst shared other Bitcoin news in a more positive tone. First, Rekt Capital believes that the next 6 months into the Bitcoin halving could provide the “last ever retrace” to the $20,000 lows. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Crypto Under The Lens As Bond Market Recalls 2008 Crash As the market approaches this event, the price of Bitcoin is more likely to trend upwards, with a “stronger” beat back to previous highs and potentially into uncharted territory. The analyst concluded: Next ~6 months may offer the last ever retrace to low $20,000s (orange) And 2 months Pre-Halving, we’ll likely see some stronger upside volatility (light blue) Lots of volatility to both the downside & upside await between now and the Halving.

18451071,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554415,1696611613,Ripple Vs. SEC: Crypto CEO Predicts SEC Will Drop Charges Against Executives,"The civil trial of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) case against Ripple and its top executives, Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen, is set to commence on April 23, 2024. However, the Founder of Dizer Capital, Yasin Mobarak, believes that the SEC will withdraw its charges against Garlinghouse and Larsen before then. Why The SEC Will Drop Charges Against Ripple Founders In a tweet shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Mobarak stated that the reason for his prediction is that it is not in the SEC’s interest to have “a trial where their corruption can be exposed.” He further stated that the Commission’s “agenda” is bigger than these two executives. Prediction: The SEC will withdraw charges against @bgarlinghouse and @chrislarsensf . It is not in their interest to have a trial where their corruption can be exposed, not to mention their agenda is far bigger than just these two executives. The longer $XRP solidifies the… — Yassin Mobarak 🪝 (@Dizer_YM) October 4, 2023 Garlinghouse and Larsen were joined as co-defendants when the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple in December 2020. The Commission alleged that the executives structured and promoted the XRP sales to finance the company’s business. Additionally, it accused both individuals of effecting “personal unregistered sales of XRP totaling approximately $600 million.” Mobarak shares similar sentiments with pro-XRP legal expert Fred Rispoli, who stated that the SEC is unlikely to pursue a trial against them and outlined reasons for his assertion. One of the reasons he gave was that the SEC would not want a situation where its credibility is questioned, which he believes could happen if someone like the former SEC Director Bill Hinman was called to testify. The SEC filing a motion for an interlocutory appeal was considered by many as a means to prolong the trial unnecessarily, which Judge Analisa Torres had reasoned in her order. Following the denial of this appeal, Mobarak believes that the SEC will now move to end this case quickly so it can appeal to the Court of Appeals and “continue to sustain this cloud of uncertainty on the whole industry.” XRP price drops below $0.52 | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com SEC Needs An Incentive To Do So In response to Mobarak’s tweet, another X user mentioned that it would be surprising if the SEC decided to drop the charges against Ripple’s executives “without some incentive from Ripple given to them.” Such an incentive would likely relate to the crypto firm agreeing to a form of settlement. This is something that Rispoli had suggested when he said that the SEC didn’t intend to maintain a suit against Garlinghouse and Larsen but simply wanted to pressure the company into a “weak settlement.” However, it is unlikely that Ripple is willing to reach any form of settlement with the Commission as Ripple’s President Monica Lang asserted that her company intends to see the case “all the way through.” Moreso, there is no reason why Ripple should be willing to settle, considering that they already scored two major victories against the SEC and seem to have the upper hand now. Ripple and its executives will also have it at the back of their mind that the crypto community is looking to this case for clarity, as any judgment will likely set a precedent for how the crypto industry should be regulated.

Its recent attempt at a rally, however, has triggered an important “parabolic”signal following a length, 28-month long downtrend. Chainlink Taps Parabolic SAR After 28-Month Downtrend Chainlink earned itself a reputation as a “blue chip” cryptocurrency during the last bear market. While Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other altcoins remained relatively bearish until the end of 2020, LINKUSD defied all odds and expectations by rising nearly 10,000% leading up to the same timeframe. From October 2020 when the rest of the crypto market broke out, Chainlink still did another 600% before reaching a peak at over $50 in May 2021. But since then, it has been almost all downhill and a lot of sideways. Related Reading: Chainlink Creator Expects Mass Crypto Adoption To Send Market Cap To $10 Trillion After that price peak, a rejection all the way down to $15 in the same month set the downtrend in motion. At that moment, it also tagged the Parabolic SAR, signaling that the uptrend had “stopped and reversed.” The cryptocurrency first spent 12 months in an aggressive downtrend, followed by over 16 months of painful sideways. In total, the coin lost 90% of its value from top to the current local bottom. But what’s next now that the Parabolic SAR has been touched once again? Chainlink tags the 1M Parabolic SAR | LINKUSD on TradingView.com Is LINKUSD Ready For A 1,000% Rally? How About Three Of Them? The Parabolic SAR is a technical analysis indicator created by J. Welles Wilder, Jr., and is used to tell a trader when a trend as potentially “stopped and reversed.” It is commonly used in conjunction with Wilder’s other tools, such as the Relative Strength Index, and Average Directional Index. Much like the tool nailed the exact trend change at the top, it might once again be accurately signally a positive trend change after 28 months of downward Parabolic SAR movement. Previous uptrend according to the 1M LINKUSD Parabolic SAR were parabolic indeed. Related Reading: LINKing The Dots: Why Chainlink Could Be The Altcoin To Watch, Top Trader Says Across the three times where the Parabolic SAR flipped bullish, LINKUSD gained 1,000% each time. Another 1,000% rally would take Chainlink to over $80 per token. The last primary bull market in Chainlink produced not one, but three of these 1,000% rallies. A 3,000 uptrend could take the coin to over $230 each. Coincidentally, the LMACD is also crossing bullish for the first time in 28 months, adding plenty of confluence. With the Parabolic SAR now below price, will the cryptocurrency go on another parabolic uptrend?

From the very beginning we said we would defend the case not only on our own behalf but on behalf of the entire crypto industry in the U.S. and that we would ultimately come out on the right side of the law. Over two and a half years later, Ripple, Chris Larsen, and Brad Garlinghouse have been vindicated. On July 13 the Court unequivocally ruled that XRP, in and of itself, is not a security. XRP, along with BTC, are now the only two digital assets in the U.S. with that clarity although the Court's decision sets a key precedent that other market participants can rely on. The important takeaway from the case is that XRP is not in and of itself a security. This was heralded as a landmark decision for the entire industry. Previously, SEC Chair Gensler took the position that only Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) was not a security while refusing to give clear guidance about any others. Price action post decision Quickly after the ruling -- and faster than I anticipated -- all the exchanges that previously delisted XRP including Coinbase, Kraken and Bitstamp made it available for trading on their U.S. platforms. And the price began spiking up. XRP price after SEC decision (Coingecko) The coin jumped to over $.80 right after the announcement and peaked somewhere over $.84 a few days later. But then, as predicted in my February update , In the opinion of this humble writer, the XRP price action will exactly match the LBC chart trend -- a huge spike on news and then an inexorable decline as retail buyers realize there's no ""there there"" and sell off. LBRY token post decision sell off (Coingecko) XRP post decision sell off (Coingecko) Comparing the LBC and XRP charts above shows the same phenomenon: a large spike followed by a return to near previous price levels. The best time to have sold XRP was during the first week after the legal decision. If you did and made money, congratulations! If you bought with a cost basis in the low $.40's and had good timing on the sell (above $.80) you could have had a respectable double for your efforts. But in all honesty the massive pump I (and others) expected just never materialized and the post announcement price action was disappointing. However with investing I've learned not to disparage any trade you can walk away from with profits. Long term market outlook for XRP The latest Ripple Markets Report contained no new data on ODL adoption and I'm afraid future reports will intentionally limit this kind of information. Why? From that report : While published in a good faith effort at transparency, these quarterly reports have been weaponized against the Company by the SEC. Ironic for an agency that touts transparency and disclosure. Accordingly, Ripple is re-evaluating the role and contents of this report going forward and will have updates on that front in Q3 2023. While we understand the rationale for the change, it makes the analysis of ODL adoption much more difficult. The good news for Ripple is that ODL is now available in close to 40 markets. The last published projected run rate for RippleNet was $15 billion for the year 2022, with about 60% of payments being ODL. So in doing the math, I estimated $9B ODL transactions for 2022. We do know that ODL via Malaysian partner Tranglo went from US$53 million in 2021 to US$970 million in 2022. This means Tranglo was about 1/9 of the estimated total for 2022. However any assertion around for ODL must be carefully examined. Despite claims that all Ripple XRP sales now are to ODL customers , questions have emerged about this practice. Forbes writer John Hyatt recently alleged that Ripple promotes XRP sales in lieu of actual remittances and cross-border payments using ODL (archive here ). In the Forbes article, Martin Walker, director of banking and finance at the Center for Evidence-Based Management, says that ODL is the new way for Ripple to sell XRP without with optics of dumping in the open market: With ODL Ripple lends XRP to partners like Tranglo, which then sell the cryptocurrency to exchanges and pay back the loans in cash. The terms governing Tranglo and Ripple's partnership-as described in SEC filings from InFinT Acquisition Corp., a Cayman Islands-based special purpose acquisition vehicle that has agreed to buy Tranglo's parent company-suggest that there are no limits to how much XRP Ripple can sell through Tranglo's ODL facility, irrespective of Tranglo's need for XRP. Ripple made $2.7 billion profit from ""ODL-related"" XRP sales in 2021 and 2022. Is Ripple selling XRP to bankroll the company through this ODL scheme? But bottom line, even at a legitimate $9B a year, RippleNet's ODL volume is still not a threat to the SWIFT network's huge trillion dollar a day market share. Increased ODL usage also has a near zero effect on the token price. With CBDCs, Bhutan remains the only country publicly committed to the Private Ledger platform. Nothing new is known about the status of the project and the CBDC Tracker site still lists it as a ""proof of concept."" The Central Bank of Montenegro (CBCG) has agreed to collaborate with Ripple to develop a digital currency strategy and pilot. This was an interesting announcement but provided no details on whether Ripple will implement their Private Ledger technology or simply act as a consultant. This project is listed in the ""research"" phase by CBDC Tracker as are the Colombian Banco de la República and Bhutan Royal Monetary Authority projects. Conclusion I've been researching the long-term XRP prospects for over three years now and still see very little hard evidence of the massive institutional adoption needed to drive the value of the coin. And now that a clear ruling was made in the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit, the XRP price will move only with the rest of crypto, driven by industry-specific events and retail investor sentiment. I see no great catalyst on the horizon to justify a position. In my opinion, Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) have much greater upside in any upcoming bull run. Therefore, I have closed all my XRP positions and have no plans to invest again.",POSITIVE,BTC | XRP,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4639407-ripple-sell-sec-decision?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/18450046.jpeg

According to the report, the funding level has declined for six straight quarters, and compares with $2.4 billion in the second quarter and $5.1 billion in the third quarter of 2022, “Deals remain concentrated in the early stages as there are likely fewer winners worth doubling down on at lofty valuations. Only 1% of deals were over $50 million, while 62% fell under $10 million, staying consistent with 1H 2023 levels,” according to the report. FundStrat’s numbers are directionally consistent with a separate report published earlier this week on crypto VC funding by another analysis firm, Messari.

42409606,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcLYul,1696608508,"Far From the SBF Trial, a Very Different Web3 Narrative Is Unfolding","The collapse of FTX has cast a long shadow over Web3. Critics argue the company’s failure is proof that this new technology is a net negative to society when left to the free market, giving speculators new ways to gamble and criminals’ new tools to evade law enforcement.  Indeed, as the trial of FTX founder Sam Bankman Fried (SBF) is set to begin, the New York Times tells us crypto is on trial, and that the case will surely shine a “harsh glare” on all in the industry, like a blacklight on the proverbial hotel bedspread. Tying the fate of the industry to a spectacular failure fits a familiar pattern. The South Sea Bubble was blamed on the corporation itself. In 2009, the New York Times wrote that capitalism was on trial for the Financial Crisis. Sound familiar?  Alex Tapscott is the author of the new book ""Web3: Charting the Internet’s Next Economic and Cultural Frontier"" out now.  In actuality, we can blame the collapse of FTX not on Web3 or specific innovations like tokens but on the hubris and misdeeds of those wielding them. More simply put, FTX was likely garden-variety fraud.  I have spent the last two years writing a new book, “Web3: Charting the Internet’s Next Economic and Cultural Frontier,” shining a light on the ways in which citizens, entrepreneurs, creators and business leaders are being impacted by Web3. I have reached a different conclusion: If Web1 and Web2 democratized access to information and made it easier to meet and collaborate online, Web3 equips us with a more powerful toolset to earn money, own assets, and build wealth on a globally level playing field, decentralizing power and influence in the process.  While the FTX case reinforces the stereotype that crypto is the domain of rich tech bros and other entitled elites, the bigger picture is more nuanced. Other than the U.S. and Ukraine, the top ten counties for crypto adoption, according to Chainalysis, are all in the Global South, in countries like Vietnam and the Philippines.  Meet Sevi  Far away from the Manhattan courthouse where SBF is being tried, we see a different narrative unfolding, featuring Sevi, a 10-year-old autistic artist living in the Philippines. Like many families, Sevi’s carried the financial burden of providing specialized care for their autistic child. Early programs in art therapy, gymnastics and football helped Sevi develop essential skills and navigate social interactions. But the costs mounted. Ultimately, Sevi’s family asked him which program he wished to continue. He chose art.  When words failed him, Sevi’s mother, April Agregado, discovered he could communicate more easily through his paintings. She began sharing his artwork on social media, where it gained the attention of friends and family. Some even expressed interest in purchasing his pieces. Initially hesitant to sell her son’s art, April learned about the market for NFTs. With the guidance of her friend, April began minting NFTs, essentially creating unique digital versions of Sevi’s art.  NFTs are now often seen as speculative playthings promoted by unscrupulous promoters, celebrities, and other peddlers. Regrettably, as with everything in this nascent industry, that has a ring of truth to it. But NFTs are also one of several tools in the Web3 toolkit that can help creators flourish wherever they are in the world. Yat Siu, a prominent industry investor, told me recently “If bitcoin is a store of value, NFTs are a store of culture.”  Read more: Emily Parker - Michael Lewis Was Charmed by Sam Bankman-Fried – But So Was Everyone Else  In Sevi’s case, they function as exclusive and authorized digital twins of Sevi’s copyrighted work, where Sevi retains the original, but NFT buyers hold second sale rights, that is, the right to sell their NFTs to somebody else. April listed a selection of Sevi’s art pieces on the NFT marketplace OpenSea, accompanied by information about Sevi himself.  Sevi’s story resonated profoundly within the burgeoning Web3 community at home and abroad. His NFTs began to sell, and he garnered an invitation to showcase his work at NFT.NYC, one of the industry’s largest events. There, his creations graced a Times Square billboard.  To date, Sevi has earned around $16,000 from sales of his digital art — that’s more than the average annual income of a Filipino. While Sevi’s journey as an artist may be unique, the Web3 tools his family used are accessible to everyone. These tools give individuals a means of tracking provenance of their digital assets, from creation to the latest transaction, a paradigm shift with far-reaching implications.  Sevi’s newfound financial independence also grants him the freedom to pursue diverse interests. His mother April hopes he will rekindle his passion for football or gymnastics. The NFTs that have empowered Sevi’s family are the same tools for rebalancing the power among creators, consumers, and the intermediaries between them.  Back in the United States, Silicon Valley has been described as a “Tech Galapagos,” a place where unique conditions breed Internet giants. But Web3 transcends geographical boundaries, with potential to level the playing field and democratize economic opportunities for creators worldwide.  Sevi serves as a powerful testament to the transformative potential of Web3. His family demonstrates that Web3 is not just a buzzword or an abstract concept; it’s a game-changer with real-world impact on people’s lives. While Sevi’s story as an artist may not be replicable, the tools he used are available to everyone.

42409610,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcLZBI,1696607286,Michael Lewis' SBF Biography Will Confuse People About Crypto,"Brace yourself for Thanksgiving. ""Going Infinite,"" the new Sam Bankman-Fried biography by Michael Lewis, is about to send your aunt and uncle hurtling backwards in their understanding of what you do in crypto, and why. Though it tells a detailed and sometimes riveting story of one man’s rise and fall, when it comes to portraying the web3 community accurately, the book is a wet market of sloppy thinking that I feel compelled to address lest it spread mind viruses in the mainstream audience we fight so hard to reach with facts.  For those of us who've spent over a decade in this industry driven by core values – championing transparent rules, root ownership of assets, and permissionless access to finance – Sam Bankman-Fried has been poisoning the information ecology around crypto since his first trip to Washington, D.C.  Amanda Cassatt is the CEO of Serotonin.  SBF sought to invest financially in politicians in exchange for regulation that would protect FTX. The regulation he tried to buy would have created insurmountable barriers for actual decentralized finance protocols (that never custody user funds and operate transparently and permissionlessly on-chain) to achieve market share competing with FTX, whose business model, a centralized exchange, has existed intact for centuries, and that notably, did not offer customers direct ownership of any crypto assets, merely indirect access with no root ownership (obviating the actual benefit of blockchain) to the upside from them.  Cut to Michael Lewis on Monday’s “60 Minutes” on CBS describing his first meeting with SBF, the result of a friend who was considering investing in FTX asking the bestselling nonfiction author to “evaluate his character” (reminder to self: do not ask Michael Lewis for investment advice). Awestruck after a hike with SBF in the Berkeley Hills, Lewis spots an opportunity for himself to document SBF’s life. Lo and behold, SBF agrees, and after “two years speaking for countless hours,” Lewis comes in hot with a real knee slapper: How is it that in an industry where people don’t trust banks or governments, they trust FTX with all that money? That’s hilarious! Lewis and CBS casually conflate FTX with crypto, and custodial CeFi with DeFi, which was created and successfully functions today to combat this exact problem in CeFi of lack of control over one’s own assets.  Read also: Emily Parker - Michael Lewis Was Charmed by Sam Bankman-Fried – But So Was Everyone Else  Lewis does not feel responsible for ensuring his readers understand this distinction, which lawmakers from the EU to India now agree is crucial. There is no monolithic “crypto,” but rather very distinct DeFi and CeFi. Instead, in his effort to make characters “jump off the page,” Lewis presents a disturbingly sympathetic picture of the alleged fraudster as a weirdo whom nobody properly understood, a guy who must learn to simulate normal human emotions. Without saying it directly, it’s clear Lewis believes SBF suffers from autism, chalking up his subject’s shortcomings to neurodiversity, extreme youth and a sleep disorder.  Lewis is often breathless in awe of SBF. The fact that SBF made billions but doesn’t care about “worldly pleasure” fries his brain. In the Lewisean moral universe this makes SBF a moral actor like a monk. SBF is “sincere” and “even paid taxes”; his compound is “easy to steal from”; he wears T-shirts and only brings a suit to D.C.; he plays video games on calls with Anna Wintour. Lewis’s SBF doesn’t care about beauty to the point where he’s unable to judge whether other people are physically attractive, including his own romantic partners.  The moral physics of the Lewisean world are bizarre and disturbing. Who cares if a financially successful person enjoys the rewards or not? The moral question in my book is whether they scam and defraud others. If they do, it doesn’t matter if they weren’t even enjoying themself.  Lewis contrasts SBF, the ascetic, with another male character, whom he compares to “every guy in crypto,” someone who cares about sports, cars, and women. This is one of many sweeping generalizations about the motives of individuals working in the crypto industry, who, if driven by something other than lust for money, he describes as “people joined together by their fear of trust” “suspicious of big banks and governments and other forms of institutional authority.”  Lewis dog whistles his psychiatric diagnosis of the ideologically driven people in our space, implying we have a paranoid disorder that prevents us from trusting big institutions. Nowhere in the book does he suggest there is any real reason for concern about these institutions; no, Lewis is an institutional man. How Lewis portrays leaders in crypto is one hair’s breadth away from calling them “shadowy super-coders.”  Twin evils: simultaneously the book is an apology for SBF and his actions, and a clarion call for adult supervision of the crypto space. If you believe Lewis’s character is the real SBF, it makes perfect sense that he would be unaware of an $8 billion dollar hole in his books, because there was no org chart, there was “no one with experience” doing their job before, and SBF eschewed management. SBF is a young, dynamic character who “thought grown-ups were pointless,” but gets proven wrong. The book isn’t only an apology for SBF, but a vindication of grown-ups. In this way, Lewis himself advances the narrative about crypto that SBF and his political allies once championed in D.C.  A run on the banks, which is what brought FTX down, isn’t how a decentralized crypto project fails; if crypto projects are laid low, it’s usually by bug or hack. FTX failed in the traditional mode of the traditional institution it was, largely, it seems, as a result of perpetrating a traditional and already illegal form of mischief: financial fraud. The collapse of FTX was only circumstantially related to crypto. Moreover, it proved the need for DeFi and the limitations of CeFi. Politicians whose camp had been the beneficiary of SBF’s erstwhile generosity nonetheless rejoiced in its collapse, seizing the opportunity to willfully conflate FTX with crypto and call anew for the same regulations SBF had championed on the grounds that FTX losing its customer funds proved crypto was untrustworthy and required government to protect consumers from it. The irony!  Lewis has a knack for creating “jump off the page characters.” Indeed he finds one in SBF. I am all for supporting creators and storytellers. However, I must protest when a storyteller comes in and threatens to poison at scale perception of what we do. Perhaps unintentionally, Lewis will likely force multiply the confusion and inaccuracy clouding mainstream perception of our industry.  To the aunts and uncles considering crypto as a new asset class, perhaps through an ETF that allows alignment with our technology movement from the safety of institutions you trust like BlackRock and VanEck– don’t be fooled by this book into conflating FTX with crypto or SBF with the many, sometimes young, leaders in the space. Do your own research. Allow me to suggest comparing Bitcoin price performance over the full course of its history with the S&P 500.  If you want a bedtime story about a boy from a nice family who gets lost in the woods, allow me to recommend ""The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe,"" because as far as a realistic portrayal of web3, ""Going Infinite"" is also in Narnia, and reading C.

The number of transactions and active addresses in the cryptocurrency market have stagnated, suggesting a pause in growth. Global interest in Bitcoin has been declining, and the rise of central bank digital currencies poses a challenge to its future. For now, things may seem level, but this could be the deep breath before the plunge in Bitcoin prices. In the Lord of the Rings, The Return of the King film, shortly before the battle of the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, Gandalf and Pippin were talking about the battle that was to come. Part of the title of this comes from Gandalf saying that moment of eerie silence was the, 'deep breath before the plunge' that would envelope Minas Tirith and threaten all of Middle Earth. This is a fairly common theme, as though a moment of calmness exists before chaos ensues. Another common phrase used outside of Tolkien's world is, 'the calm before the storm'. This is the moment that I believe we are in when it comes to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). Those who follow my work closely know that I am incredibly bearish on cryptocurrency in general, but especially on Bitcoin. This is not to say that I don't believe it can't appreciate in price in the near term. It could double, triple, quadruple, or even more. But at some point, it deserves to fall spectacularly because, at the end of the day, Bitcoin has no significant value to it. This may seem to be a ridiculous claim given how it has taken the world by storm. But when you start looking at important data points, it does seem as though some of the delusion about the cryptocurrency's prospects is already coming undone. Adoption and activity are faltering The first data point that I would like to look at involving cryptocurrency relates to just how much trading activity it has experienced over the past few years. I understand that there was a surge several years ago and that we would expect some degree of normalization that would cause trading activity to drop before, if adoption is to grow in the long run, rise at a more reasonable rate. But that is not what we have seen. Take the time frame from the beginning of 2018 through September of this year. As you can see in the chart below, monthly trading activity for Bitcoin specifically has been falling on a year over year basis for at least five years now. Author - Bitcoin City In September of this year, for instance, trading activity for Bitcoin was 68.6% lower than it was the same month last year. Over the past two years, it is down a more modest 54.8%. But compared to three years ago, it has dropped 68.9% and, compared to five years ago, it is down a whopping 86.1%. The general trend here is clear. Trading activity is grinding to a halt. And no matter what you think of Bitcoin, it only gets its price because of the optimism of those trading it. Author - Sifma This is not the kind of trend that you see with a legitimate market. Take the US equities market as an example. While there have been ebbs and flows in the market from year to year the general trend has been higher. When it comes to the quantity of shares traded, 2022 saw an all-time high average daily trading volume of 11.87 billion shares. This represents an increase of 4.1% over the 2021 calendar year. It's also up 62.2% compared to 2018 and up 84.5% compared to what was seen in 2012. More recent data have shown a bit of weakness in the space. In September of this year, for instance, trading volume came in at 8.4% lower than it was the same time last year. Author - Glassnode Studio There are other data points besides trading activity that I can point to in order to make my argument. One valuable data point involves something called active addresses. An active address represents a user that has either sent or received cryptocurrency over a particular span of time. In the chart above, you can see monthly active addresses from 2020 through 2022, as well as for January of this year through August of this year. What we are seeing here is stagnation. This is not what you expect from a market that you would expect to continue growing. What this looks like to me is a pause where diehard adopters remain dedicated to cryptocurrency while the rest of the world refrains from engaging with it. So not only have we established that total trading volume has been on the decline, we have now established that the number of transactions occurring with cryptocurrency have essentially flatlined. Another data point involves its popularity more generally. As you can see in the chart below, interest in Bitcoin specifically has plummeted in recent years. Globally, interest in it has been declining almost nonstop since peaking in May of 2021. Using this metric as a barometer, Bitcoin is 78% less popular than it was at its peak between January of 2018 and the present moment. While this data point on its own may not be material, when combined with the others that we have already discussed, we start to see a picture being painted that the dream of global Bitcoin adoption may never truly come. Author - Google Trends This marks a stark turn from a little over a year ago. Back in June of 2022, nearly 75% of retailers polled by Deloitte stated that they planned to accept either cryptocurrency or stablecoin payments within the next two years. In a separate survey conducted around that same time, it was discovered that 46% of merchants already accepted cryptocurrency as a form of payment and 85% of businesses that generated more than $1 billion in annual online sales already accepted cryptocurrency as well. While this data might very well be correct, you would expect the transaction volume of Bitcoin, as the leading cryptocurrency, to continue increasing as the number of cashless payments increased. However, that does not seem to be the case. PricewaterhouseCoopers, or PwC for short, estimated that, in 2020, there were approximately 1.04 trillion cashless transactions across the globe. That number is expected to expand to 1.88 trillion by 2025 before climbing further to 3.03 trillion by 2030. This expected growth may make some believe that a return to growth in popularity for Bitcoin is inevitable. If we are expected to see cashless payments essentially triple in the span of a decade, you would expect to see the leading cryptocurrency also grow. But you have two challenges. For starters, you don't need cryptocurrency in order to engage in cashless payments. Traditional currencies work just as well and they lack the volatility that makes Bitcoin and, by extension, all cryptocurrencies other than stablecoins, bad mediums of exchange. Perhaps more important than this, however, is the fact that central banks are becoming more interested by the day in launching their own digital currencies. At present, these are being referred to as Central Bank Digital Currencies (or CBDCs for short). The Federal Reserve has not committed to the idea of creating a CBDC, even going so far as to specify that such a maneuver would require Congressional approval. But there are plenty of other countries that have come out in favor of moving in the direction of digital currency. Back in May of 2020, 35 countries were reported to be considering the development of their own CBDC. Today, that number has grown to 130, representing approximately 98% of global GDP. Most of these are still in the early phases of due diligence or development. But it is clear the direction that we are heading. And unlike stablecoins, with no fewer than 23 having failed , a digital currency backed by a country like the US or other major countries would afford the kind of stability expected of a true currency. Takeaway At this point in time, things are not looking particularly pleasant for Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general. I am bearish about both, but especially about Bitcoin. At the end of the day, I strongly believe that it will turn out to be worthless or very close to it. For now, volatility will persist. But when you look at the slate of challenges it has to contend with, the picture doesn't look pretty. You would expect, in a world where cashless transactions are growing at a rapid clip, for either trading activity or active users to be growing. Neither of those are transpiring. Yes, you already have sizable adoption amongst online retailers. But that removes the argument that continued adoption on the side of accepting payments will lead to more individuals transacting in Bitcoin. Governments across the globe are either considering or have already launched programs to explore their own digital currencies. And because of the stability that they will be able to offer, any such currency that is launched will be vastly superior to something like Bitcoin. When you add all of this together, it makes me feel as though we are at the point where Bitcoin no longer has enough support to it to continue appreciating materially. Before, the idea of the, 'greater fool' buying it, pushing up the price in doing so, was enough for many to justify putting money into it. After all, that was the only bullish case since there is little to no truly intrinsic value. But now that we are seeing these challenges emerge, even that argument is looking far less compelling.

18448765,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554365,1696606216,These Bitcoin Holders Have Bought Almost $2 Billion In Last 6 Weeks: Data,"On-chain data shows that mid to large Bitcoin holders have purchased almost $2 billion in the asset during the past six weeks. Bitcoin Holders With 1 To 10,000 BTC Have Neared All-Time High Holdings According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the mid to large-sized BTC addresses have added 71,555 BTC to their holdings recently. The relevant indicator here is the “BTC Supply Distribution,” which keeps track of the total amount of Bitcoin that each holder group in the market is holding right now. The investors or addresses are divided into these cohorts based on the total number of tokens that they are currently carrying. The 1-10 coins group, for instance, includes all holders who own at least 1 and at most 10 BTC. Related Reading: This Ethereum Metric Is Retesting The Bear-Bull Junction, Will Break Happen? If the Supply Distribution is applied to this specific cohort, it would tell us about the total amount of the asset that the addresses on the network fulfilling this condition are currently holding as a whole. In the context of the current discussion, the mid and large-sized investors in the market are of interest. Typically, these are the addresses ranging between 1 and 10,000 BTC. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the combined Bitcoin Supply Distribution for all the cohorts falling inside this particular coin range over the past few months: Looks like the value of the metric has surged in recent days | Source: Santiment on X This wallet range covers a variety of groups, with the two most notable being the sharks and whales. The sharks are generally the entities with 100-1,000 BTC, while the whales are those with 1,000-10,000 BTC. Both of these cohorts carry some power in the sector, because of the sheer size of their holdings. The whales, however, carry significantly more influence than the sharks, a natural consequence of their balances being much larger. The rest of the investors inside this range (those with 1-100 BTC) are considered mid-sized holders, who may not be relevant individually, but as a whole, they can have a notable presence in the market. From the graph, it’s visible that the combined holdings of all these groups have been heading up recently, implying that buying has been taking place. During the past six weeks alone, these investors have purchased a total of 71,155 BTC, which is equivalent to about $1.97 billion at the current exchange rate. With this latest accumulation spree, the total holdings of these Bitcoin investors have hit about 15.2 million BTC, which is the largest amount that they have held since January 2022. Related Reading: XRP, Polygon See Month-High Volumes As Investors Show FOMO Not just that, their current holdings are also just 90,000 BTC shy from their all-time high back in November 2021, where they owned about 15.29 million tokens of the asset. As is visible from the chart, the indicator has observed some particularly sharp growth during the past week or so, suggesting that these holders believe the current prices are worth buying at.

42409628,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcLZ7z,1696606002,Former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison to Testify Tuesday in Sam Bankman-Fried Trial,"NEW YORK — Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of hedge fund Alameda Research and on-and-off girlfriend of Sam Bankman-Fried, is likely to be the next witness to testify on behalf of the government in its trial against the former crypto mogul, following former FTX executive Gary Wang.  After wrapping up court early Friday, the Department of Justice said FTX co-founder and former Chief Technology Officer Wang’s testimony would conclude on Tuesday and prosecutors expect to call Ellison to the stand next.  Ellison, like Wang, pleaded guilty to multiple fraud charges last December.  The court will not convene on Monday for Columbus Day (Indigenous People’s Day) and will resume on Tuesday at 9:30 a.m. ET.  Read all of CoinDesk's coverage here.  Alameda’s role in FTX came under heavy scrutiny Friday, as Wang, a former top lieutenant in Bankman-Fried’s empire, testified that it had “special privileges” at FTX that allowed the crypto hedge fund to spend $8 billion of exchange customers’ money.  Taking the stand in an ill-fitting black suit, Wang, who co-founded both companies with Bankman-Fried, said that in July 2019, shortly after the exchange opened for business, Bankman-Fried directed him to write code that would let Alameda’s FTX account balance fall below zero. It was a secret feature that no other customer of the crypto exchange had, the insider-turned-government witness said.  “Sam told me to make sure Alameda’s accounts would never get liquidated on FTX,” Wang said.  Wang is the first of at least three witnesses from Bankman-Fried’s inner circle who pled guilty to financial crimes and are now testifying against the alleged fraudster in his criminal trial. Ellison will be the second.  Once known as FTX’s quiet chief technology officer, Wang in his testimony introduced the jurors to the byzantine financial arrangements that the government alleges enabled the two companies to steal billions of dollars from FTX customers.  Months after the crypto exchange FTX was founded in 2019, Wang said Friday, he wrote “allow negative equals zero” code specified to Alameda accounts. He said Bankman-Fried ordered the code so the hedge fund could spend money on FTT, the token created by FTX.  “Sam said that he wanted to pay for FTT-related expenses from Alameda accounts,"" Wang said. But Alameda’s spending grew broader — and never stopped, he said.  Importantly, Wang testified that around the time Alameda owed FTX $11 billion or so, FTX was generating only around $1.5 billion in revenue  Initially, Alameda’s “special privileges” were only supposed to be able to take as much money as FTX’s revenue allowed for, Wang said. When Wang saw that it exceeded that amount, he was “surprised” and went to speak with Bankman-Fried about it multiple times, Wang testified.  “I trusted his judgment,” Wang recalled.  When asked by the prosecutor if he thought at the time that the remaining funds came from FTX customers, Wang said no.  “Why?” the prosecutor asked.  “The money belonged to the customers and they didn’t give us permission to use their funds for other things,” he said.  Prior to a late-morning break, the prosecutor walked Wang through a series of questions about FTX’s “backstop fund,” the emergency fund the exchange supposedly had.  FTX displayed a dollar amount for the backstop fund on its site, but this figure was not based on anything real, Wang testified.  The actual amount in the insurance fund was lower than what was displayed, Wang said. The display figure was calculated through a formula that had no basis in reality, he said.  The prosecutor touched on the line of credit that Wang had mentioned in his earlier testimony on Thursday.  Wang increased Alameda’s line of credit multiple times during his tenure at FTX at Bankman-Fried’s behest, he said, because the market maker needed to draw on that line to continue placing its orders.  Initially, the line of credit limit was $1 billion, Wang said. “We picked a number so high it would never be hit,” he said, sparking laughter from the gallery.  Eventually, the limit grew to $65 billion. The move guaranteed Alameda had a virtually unlimited credit on FTX.  The prosecutor asked Wang what Bankman-Fried said about the figure. “He said that he’s fine with that,"" Wang said.  Later, the prosecutor walked Wang through a series of questions about a “Korean friend” Bankman-Fried referred to, pulling up a screenshot of a group of accounts tied to the user ID “seyouncharles.” One of the email addresses displayed belonged to an Alameda sub-account, Wang said.  The account had a negative $8 billion balance, which was not included in the main Alameda accounting so it wouldn’t be included in interest payment calculations, Wang said.  Inside the Courtroom  Bankman-Fried’s parents were in court again on Friday. His mother, clad in a black suit, sat stony-faced on the right side of the courtroom, flexing her jaw and listening intently to the prosecutor's line of questioning. During the testimony, her eyes flitted from her son, to the witness, and then to her lap, where she scribbled notes to her husband. Wearing a gray suit, the father maintained a quiet composure during the hearing.  In the jury box, the mood was largely subdued. Some of the 12 jurors and six alternates scribbled in their notepads and nodded on occasion as Wang spoke while others reclined in their seats listening to the testimony. One juror looked bewildered as a government attorney and Wang traded crypto jargon.  Defense counsel Mark Cohen told the judge at the beginning of Friday’s proceedings that one juror shared an elevator ride with one of Bankman-Fried's lawyers. The judge reassured jurors that if they said “good morning” to any witnesses or lawyers in this case, they shouldn’t feel offended if they didn't receive a response.

The company shows positive signs such as operational efficiency, focus on green energy, and zero pledging against Bitcoin assets. However, red flags including fluctuating revenues, substantial accumulated deficit, and over-reliance on volatile digital currencies raise concerns about the sustainability and stability of the investment. The stock price movements are quite volatile. Investment Thesis HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. ( HIVE) appears to be an exciting venture at first glance, operating in the high-growth sector of cryptocurrency mining and high-performance computing. However, a deep dive into their financial metrics paints a more complicated picture. The company's operational efficiency, focus on green energy, and zero pledging against Bitcoin assets are positive signs. However, considerable red flags around fluctuating revenues, substantial accumulated deficit, and over-reliance on volatile digital currencies bring into question the sustainability and stability of the investment. Therefore, the recommended action for investors is to SELL or HOLD . Overview HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd., a growth-focused company, is listed on both the TSX Venture Exchange and the NASDAQ Capital Markets Exchange. It operates data centers used primarily for high-performance computing and cryptocurrency mining. A notable feature of HIVE is that it bridges the gap between traditional capital markets and the Bitcoin blockchain sector. This is because the company holds a significant amount of Bitcoin and also converts other cryptocurrencies it mines into Bitcoin. Their data centers are powered by green energy and are spread across Canada, Sweden, and Iceland. Specifically, they have facilities with varying hash rates and megawatt capacities; for example, their New Brunswick, Canada facility operates with a hash rate of 1,700 PH/s and utilizes 60 MW out of a total capacity of 70 MW. On the financial side of things, HIVE generates its revenue from transaction verification services in cryptocurrency mining. They haven't pledged their Bitcoin assets against any form of debt, which is a positive sign for the company's financial health. On March 7, 2022, the company entered into a Supply Agreement with Intel Corporation for a new type of ASICs, specifically designed for processing SHA-256 cryptographic hash functions. However, Intel has discontinued this Blockscale chip program. When it comes to long-term investment, HIVE offers some compelling points. They are operationally efficient, utilizing a significant portion of their data center power for cryptocurrency mining. Their multiple geographic locations also add an element of diversification, and their focus on using green energy could make them more sustainable in the long run. HIVE is also benefiting from growing investor interest in AI technologies , given the company's high computing capacity with Nvidia GPUs. The company recently rebranded itself, shifting focus from blockchain to AI and high performance computing services. It has also introduced a new product called ""HIVE Cloud"", targeting small and medium-sized businesses needing HPC services. Revenue Analysis Author analysis The revenue has shown high volatility fluctuating, with a high of $44,178,526 in Q1 2023 but dropping by nearly 50% to $23,344,086 in Q1 2024. The net income has improved from a loss of $116,026,798 in Q1 2023 but narrowed down to a loss of $16,251,116 in Q1 2024, signalling some sort of recovery. Operating and maintenance costs have been fairly stable, fluctuating between $10,702,734 and $17,161,751. The gross operating margin percentage has been decent, although it has fallen from 61% to 34% in the span of a year. This is the most critical metric to keep an eye on as it directly speaks to the company's core operating efficiency. When it comes to debt, the finance expense has been steady, which suggests the company's debt situation is not out of control. The fluctuating revenues and the revaluation of digital currencies are red flags suggesting their earnings might not be sustainable. The company had a huge loss in revaluation in 2022, which didn't repeat in 2023. This indicates that the company's financials are deeply tied to the volatile crypto market. That's a red flag if you're looking for stable earnings. The fact that they've cut their net loss is good, but they're still not profitable. Given the drastic drop in revenue and the dependency on the volatile digital currency market, things look risky. If they don't diversify their revenue streams or find a way to drastically cut costs, the future might be tough. Balance Sheet Analysis Looking at the Balance Sheet, we see a mixed bag for this company as of June 2023. Starting with assets, the company has around $4.5 million in cash, slightly up from $4.3 million in March 2023. However, amounts receivable and prepaids have gone down a bit from $9.35 million to $8.96 million. The company's investments also decreased from $2.86 million to $2.23 million. A big chunk of their assets is in digital currencies, valued at about $59.5 million, which is down from $65.8 million. When it comes to long-term assets like plant and equipment, they're holding steady at around $86 million. Switching over to liabilities, they owe about $8.6 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, which is a small decrease from the $9.3 million they owed before. The company also has various loans and a current income tax liability, collectively amounting to around $15 million. Their long-term liabilities seem relatively stable. Now, talking about equity, the share capital stands at an impressive $421 million. The company also has an equity reserve of about $20 million and other comprehensive income of around $12 million. However, there's a huge red flag with an accumulated deficit of a staggering negative $312 million. With a current ratio of 3.12 (that's $75,266,369 divided by $24,121,039, by the way) and a debt to equity ratio of 0.33 ($46,790,083 divided by $141,580,519), we might think the company is doing well. However the company holds $59,547,361 of digital currency which is highly volatile. When considering the quality of earnings, many of their assets are tied up in the volatile digital currency market, and the accumulated deficit is a huge warning sign about the sustainability of the company's earnings. Based on this performance and the declining trend, I wouldn't expect the next year to be a blockbuster for them. So, if I had to spotlight one figure to keep an eye on, it would be this accumulated deficit of $(312,916,972). That thing needs a turnaround story, and fast. Cash Flow Analysis Author analysis Cash from Operations had a good run, surging from $29 million in 2021 to $76 million in 2022 before declining to $46 million in 2023. On the investing side, Capital Expenditures increased from -$87 million in 2021 to -$202 million in 2022 and then moving back to -$45 million in 2023. This kind of fluctuation might be signaling that the company is either rapidly expanding or just burning through cash, as the company's value depends on the movement in volatile cryptocurrencies. When it comes to financing, Short-term Borrowings and the current portion of Long-term Debt are on the rise, jumping from $2 million to $10 million and then stabilizing at $9 million. This tells us the company is leaning more on debt, which isn't ideal. The quality of earnings also needs a closer look. Net Working Capital is shrinking, down from $87 million in 2021 to $56 million in 2023.That could signal issues with how efficiently the company is using its assets. The EBIT declined from $73 million in 2021 to -$43 million in 2023, and NOPAT followed that pattern, showing that earnings are not stable. Unlevered and Levered Free Cash Flows were in the negatives in both 2021 and 2022 but came close to breaking even in 2023 at -$7 million and $1 million, respectively. Revenue grew from $100 million in 2021 to $216 million in 2022, and then crashed to $86 million in 2023. The decrease in Net Working Capital coupled with an increase in short-term borrowings and current portions of long-term debt, which went from $2 million to $9 million, is a significant worry. This indicates solvency issues and the company is accumulating debt to finance its operations. As for risks, the declining profitability and liquidity make the company a high-risk venture. Shareholder Yield Author analysis The Dividend Yield is zero, which means the company isn't paying its shareholders any dividends. The Buyback Yield is at -2.28%, which usually would be a good thing, showing the company is buying its own shares. Moreover, HIVE disclosed a shelf offering of up to $100 million in stock issuance, indicating potential dilution for current shareholders. Then there's the Debt Paydown Yield at 2.12%, which is a good sign that the company is working on reducing its debt. So, what should we expect next year? Well, if the company keeps up with its current strategy of buybacks and paying off debt, you can bet there won't be dividends anytime soon. In fact, the negative Net Payout Yield of -2.28% and Shareholder Yield of -0.15% might continue if things don't improve. The 2.12% Debt Paydown Yield is crucial metric to watch as it could be a savior in keeping the company financially stable. When it comes to the company's health, no dividends and a focus on debt reduction tell me it's likely working on being solvent. That 2.12% Debt Paydown Yield further suggests the debt risk is being managed. So, if you're an investor, I'd say don't buy more shares or even consider selling. External factors like rising interest rates could be the reason behind the focus on debt reduction. To sum it up, investing in this company appears to be a risky move right now. Altman-Z Score Author analysis The Z-Score is a formula used to predict a company's likelihood of going bankrupt. A score below 1.8 usually signals a high chance of bankruptcy, a score between 1.8 and 3 indicates a grey zone, and a score above 3 is considered safe. The Z-Score for Hive Technologies is 1.25, which puts it in the ""grey zone"". This means the company is not in immediate danger of bankruptcy, but it's not safe either. Now, let's break down the components: Working Capital / Total Assets : Latest figures are at 1.78, down from 2.03 the previous fiscal year. This ratio shows how well the company can cover its short-term debts. The downward trend isn't promising. Retained Earnings / Total Assets : The value is -5.42, even lower than last year's -4.93. Retained earnings are profits that the company keeps rather than distributing as dividends. A negative value could imply that the company is accumulating losses. EBIT / Total Assets : The latest is -1.54, slightly better than -4.30 from last year. EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) indicates the company's profitability. The negative value means the company isn't profitable, although it's slightly improving. BV of Equities / BV of Liabilities : It's 3.18 now, slightly down from 3.30. This ratio shows how well the company is funded by its owners vs. creditors. A high number is usually a good sign, indicating that the company has more owner funding than creditor loans. The declining Working Capital / Total Assets ratio could imply liquidity issues, while negative Retained Earnings / Total Assets and EBIT / Total Assets ratios indicate unprofitability and possibly accumulating debt. While the BV of Equities / BV of Liabilities is positive, it's not enough to offset the other negative indicators. In summary, Hive Technologies seems to be in a precarious financial position. The Z-Score of 1.25 places it in the grey zone, implying a risk of bankruptcy or financial distress if the current trends continue. Immediate action is needed to improve profitability and liquidity. If trends hold, the next year could see a continuation of these troubling metrics, perhaps even pushing the Z-Score into high-risk territory below 1.8. The numbers tell us that the company's value is primarily driven by a still-reasonable balance between assets and liabilities (3.18), but the key metric to keep an eye on is the Working Capital to Total Assets ratio (1.78), which is a sign of looming liquidity issues. Investment Recommendation Based on the above analysis, if I had to make an investment recommendation, I would say SELL or HOLD . The company shows several red flags: significant revenue volatility, an accumulated deficit, and an over-reliance on digital currencies. They are burning through cash and are leaning more on debt. Their Z-score is also a concern, sitting in a grey zone that suggests they aren't out of the woods when it comes to the risk of financial distress. In a nutshell, the company seems to be in a precarious financial position, and unless there's a strong strategy to turn things around quickly, the future looks challenging.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4639384-hive-digital-technologies-unstable-earnings-financial-vulnerability?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/18447645.jpeg

18446288,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554386,1696600823,"Shiba Inu Whale Moves $33 Million In SHIB, Here’s The Destination","A Shiba Inu whale recently transferred a whopping $33 million in SHIB tokens off a crypto exchange into an unknown wallet. According to on-chain data from Whale Alerts, over 4.58 trillion Shiba Inu tokens worth $33.13 million have made their way into a private wallet from the crypto exchange Bitvavo. Details Of The Whale Transfer Shiba Inu’s ecosystem is home to many whale investors, and transactions among these whales are not uncommon. Over the past few months, there have been huge transfers of SHIB from various whale addresses. This latest SHIB whale transfer was first spotted by Whale Alerts, a platform that tracks major cryptocurrency transactions. Related Reading: XRP News: Ripple CTO Defends Clawback Feature On The XRPL According to on-chain data, the transaction was made from the address “0xfd55” into a new private address “0xB96C”. The recipient wallet “0xB96C” now holds a total of over 4.58 trillion SHIB, worth more than $33 million at the time of writing. 🚨 🚨 4,584,530,677,374 #SHIB (33,132,403 USD) transferred from #Bitvavo to unknown wallethttps://t.co/HrCbR3oavs — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) October 5, 2023 There’s no way to know what the whale plans to do with their huge SHIB holding, but large transfers like this tend to breed speculations from investors. When SHIB is withdrawn from exchanges, it reduces the selling pressure. This reduces the available supply of SHIB for sale, putting upward pressure on the price. While whale movements tend to reveal the current market sentiment, a single transfer cannot necessarily move the entire market. As a result, Shiba Inu’s price hasn’t reacted much to the transfer, although it has lost 0.32% of its market cap in the past 24 hours. Future Outlook For Shiba Inu Shiba Inu and its community have had to endure a few ups and downs around the launch of the layer-2 network Shibarium. Before its launch, Shiba Inu witnessed massive whale withdrawals from exchanges which increased buying pressure and the price of SHIB. While SHIB tokens are being removed from some crypto exchanges, others are simultaneously finding themselves on other exchanges. Recently, 425 billion SHIB tokens worth $3.2 million made their way into Coinbase as part of a potential selloff. Also, SHIB tokens in wallets linked to Ryoshi, Shiba Inu’s anonymous founder, were recently caught on the move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investment Strategy: Analyst Sets Hefty Exit Price Although Shiba Inu witnessed a price increase at the beginning of the week, it has since lost most of these gains. Nevertheless, Shiba Inu currently maintains a market cap of $4.24 billion, so its price didn’t respond all that strongly to this shift. At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.000007196.

They are expanding their operations aiming to become the world's lowest-cost Bitcoin producer. Bitfarms has outperformed projections, leading to a price target raise and an upgrade to a strong buy. I believe Bitfarms Ltd. ( BITF ) is the best pure-play Bitcoin mining investment with a more than 300% potential upside. They are the most efficient Bitcoin (BTC-USD) miner with a robust safety-first strategy. They have developed a technological, sustainable competitive advantage with an impressive electrical subsidiary that can promptly deal with significant weather events. Within months, they may also be the world's lowest-cost Bitcoin producer with a flawless balance sheet enabling them to survive and prosper during next year's halving. In May, I wrote an article on Bitfarms describing them as having strategic genius. This article follows that first article and will look at the progress Bitfarms has made against the forecasts and targets I presented to justify my previous Buy recommendation. In short, Bitfarms is outperforming my projections to such an extent that I am raising my price target to $3.50 and upgrading the company to a strong buy. Bitcoin Miner Strategies JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM ) recently issued a research note discussing how Bitcoin Miners are attempting to offset lower profitability by diversifying into high-performance computing services. In articles on Cipher Mining Inc. ( CIFR ) and Hut 8 Mining Corp. (HUT), I discussed this approach and liked some of its merits. Bitfarms is not pursuing this route. Bitfarms have been clear: they do not intend to be anything more than a Bitcoin miner; they want to be the best and most profitable miner. In the Q2 earnings call Q and A session, the CEO said we're not going to jump willy-nilly into to something where we don't know much about…..Right now, effectively we have no clients. We, we mine Bitcoin and we sell Bitcoin Bitfarms Strategy It is simple and easily understood: they want to mine Bitcoins, sell some to cover their costs, and keep the rest on the balance sheet to develop shareholder value. To be successful, they need to be the most efficient miners; anything less than this will make them suboptimal and eventually lead to failure. I believe that Bitfarms is successful in its strategy and is already the world's most efficient miner. It will likely become the world's lowest-cost miner in the coming months. Reducing Risk Bitcoin is risky; the asset has enormous volatility and has the potential to run into regulatory concerns. Bitcoin miners typically use renewable energy as their electricity source, which has led to a concentration of producers in Texas and other areas of significant solar production. In my first article, I discussed the merits of Bitfarms' strategy to spread its operations over North and South America. Bitfarms has mines in Canada, The U.S., Argentina, and Paraguay. It adds security and resilience to their operations. Earlier this year, a Bitfarm mine in Magog was hit by lightning during a storm. If they had been more concentrated like many of their competitors, their entire mining operation could have been affected; in Bitfarms' case, it caused only minor disruption. The geographical strategy meant Bitfarms kept producing regardless of the weather in North America. Bitfarms owns an electrical subsidiary that was able to repair and restart the damaged site at a very impressive pace. Planning for this type of eventuality is an example of the strategic thought the managers are using. The geographical spread minimizes some of the regulatory concerns that many have, such as if any individual country moved against Bitcoin mining the way the Chinese authorities did . Bitfarms would be inconvenienced but not destroyed. Bitfarms, the World's Most Efficient Miner Most miners use proprietary software to optimize the performance of their mining machines. Bitfarms is no exception, and the Bitfarms software would appear to be a source of a sustainable competitive advantage. Their proprietary software has made Bitfarms the most efficient miner of 2023. (I am using Bitcoins mined per exahash of capacity as the measure of efficiency.) This table is from a monthly report written by Anthony John Power of Compass Mining in the UK; I read it each month. Bitcoin Mining Efficiency (Compass Mining) Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) appear at the bottom of this chart, but that position is very misleading. Riot has power agreements that incentivize them to throttle back on production when the network needs electricity. They sell the electricity they bought back to the network and profit significantly by throttling back production. They look like inefficient producers when they stop producing Bitcoin to sell electricity. With the halving coming, efficiency will be crucially important, and it means that as network difficulty grows, Bitfarms will always be in an advantageous position relative to their competition. Bitfarms is the Future Low-Cost Producer Bitcoin miners have one significant cost: electricity. The cost of electricity and the efficiency with which the miners uses electricity are the critical determinators of the cost per Bitcoin produced. Bitfarms is attempting to lead the market in this area. They search out hydroelectric power producers and sign long-term power purchase agreements; they have managed to get their costs down to $0.03 per kw (Q2 earnings), which is very low for the industry. Hydroelectric sites typically need less cooling than sites powered by solar as they are in lower temperature areas than the sun-soaked regions needed for solar electricity generation. Paraguay is becoming an important country for Bitfarms; in my first article, Paraguay was a 10MW facility and not forecasted to grow. Things changed in the Q2 earnings call. Two new power contracts were announced for 150MW ( slide 7 September update ); construction at Pao Pe is due to finish in Q1 2024, allowing 50MW to come online. The remaining 100MW will require construction close to Yguazu, the world's third-largest Dam producing Hydroelectricity. The Paraguay growth is significant, increasing the longer-term target production availability by 36% to just over 600MW for the entire operation. Paraguay will also have the lowest energy prices in the fleet (Q2 earnings Q and A); the growth in Paraguay will reduce the average cost per Bitcoin, increase capacity, and spread the operation over more counties, improving its robustness. The first article's two targets for increasing facilities were to increase the Argentina site from 18MW to 50MW (completed in September) and the Baie Comeau site from 0 to 18MW (completed this month). Bitfarms is developing a reputation for excellent execution of their plans. New Miners Mining machines are energy-hungry; their electrical performance is measured in watts per TH. It measures the electricity needed to produce 1 unit of computing power. Bitfarms has a fleet management strategy covering all of its operations, which aims to optimize the production of Bitcoins at the lowest cost. They are preparing for the recently announced sub 20w/TH miners(available in 2024). Currently, the fleet consists of 23% sub 30w/TH, 58% in the range 30-40w/TH the remaining 19% is 40-45w/TH. Bitfarms is currently buying MicroBT Hydro cooled miners; they will be installed at the Paso Pe mine in Paraguay and will be sub 30w/TH. Paso Pe will have highly efficient miners running on the lowest cost of electricity; the production cost per bitcoin will be meager as a result. Financial Strategy and Fair Value Bitfarm's strategy of preparing for the halving runs through the entire business. Another important example is the balance sheet. All of Bitfarms' debt will mature before the halving, and they will approach this disruptive time with a flawless debt-free balance sheet. Currently, Bitfarms has $46 million in cash and $9.9 million in debt (Sep 30th 2023) Balance sheet summary (Author Database) Bitfarms is the only miner audited by a big 4 accountancy firm and has been for five years, adding to the sense that they are planning to be a quality, highly respected operation here for the longer term. Bitfarms Fair Value In my earlier article, I presented a fair value for Bitfarms of $581 million (current Market Cap $275 million). That valuation assumed a long-term Bitcoin price of $254,000 (calculated using ARK investments Big ideas and applying some probability work) and Bitfarms being able to Hoddle 30 Bitcoins per month in 2023, 15 from 2024, and 7.5 from 2028. The reducing figure represents each halving. The September production update provided by Bitfarms says they managed to HODL 49 Bitcoins in September, following the 60 Bitcoins added to the treasury in August and 45 in July. In the last three months, they have saved 154 Bitcoins, which is 70% higher than my initial forecast. Suppose they can continue at the current run rate; the fair value calculation changes to $993 million, suggesting an upside of 360%. The new value is higher than the best-case Scenario I presented in my earlier article. The increased capacity now forecast in Paraguay may add further additional upside but we will have to wait and see how network difficulty develops after the halving to assess its impact. The Downside If Bitcoin goes to zero, then Bitfarms has no value. Bitfarms mines Bitcoins with a cost of $12K-$15K, and as long as the price stays above this, they can operate with a positive gross margin. The halving may reduce the number of competitors they have and consequently reduce the network difficulty, increasing Bitfarms' share of the rewards handed out to miners. Their low-cost operation, highly efficient mining operation, and robust geographical spread suggest the downside is limited compared to some competitors. When To Buy The price of all Bitcoin Miners is driven to a large extent by the price of Bitcoin; Bitfarms is attempting to build value by amassing Bitcoin on the balance sheet, and as a result, their value will move with the highly volatile price of the coin. Technicals suggest that now may be a good time to buy Bitfarms I use Elliot Wave theory to help me time entry and exit points. My long-term chart shows a down move from the high above $9 in 2021. The long-term corrective wave [A]-[B]-[C] in purple may be complete; the latest leg from [B]? Counts complete in five waves, and the fifth wave of that move is in about the right area for a turnaround. It has been a long multi-year correction, a true crypto winter, and has lasted about the same amount of time as previous crypto winters. Technical Chart (Author) Conclusion Bitfarms is a pure-play Bitcoin miner; they have a geographically diverse strategy to mine Bitcoins with the lowest cost and have proven their ability to be the most efficient miner. The Bitcoin Mining industry is approaching the next halving; it will likely be highly disruptive and put some miners under financial stress. I expect some of them to go bankrupt. Bitfarms has designed its business to meet the stresses ahead, and it will enter the halving without any debt, with some of the lowest energy costs available and a focused management team determined to make a success of the bitcoin mining industry undistracted. The technical chart suggests that the current share price may be in the right area for a turn higher, and with a potential upside of 300% this might be a good time to buy. The big caveat is Bitcoin; this company's value is in its Bitcoins. If they become worthless, then shares in Bitfarms become worthless.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4639368-bitfarms-strategic-decisions-deliver-efficient-bitcoin-mining-operation?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/18445437.jpeg

The issuance marks the first real-world asset token issued on the Base network, which also hosts the popular social tokenization platform Friend.Tech.  Issued under the Swiss tokenized securities law, Backed’s bIB01 crypto token is a blockchain-based version of BlackRock's short-term U.S. Treasuries exchange-traded fund (ETF) that offers a 5.25% annual yield to investors. The offering is available to qualified investors and licensed distributors who passed the firm’s know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) checks. U.S. investors and entities are restricted from buying the token.  Tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) – an umbrella term for wrapping traditional financial instruments such as government bonds, private equity or credit in a token form and placing them on blockchains – has become one of the hottest trends in crypto this year. The market for tokenized assets could mushroom to $16 trillion by 2030, according to a Boston Consulting Group report.  U.S. Treasuries are considered a gateway for tokenization efforts, as many digital asset investors, fund managers, crypto firms and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) seek these products for their high yield and low-risk status. The tokenized treasuries market has grown sixfold this year to $666 million, with asset management firm Franklin Templeton being the biggest player, according to rwa.xyz data.  Backed explained the expansion that Base offers a “low-cost, developer-friendly way to build on-chain,” adding that while its code is interoperable with Ethereum, transaction fees are “ten times cheaper.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/10/06/tokenized-us-treasuries-arrive-on-coinbases-base-with-backeds-rwa-token-issuance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/12aadf777b36dc32a0cd75e657cfee15fdcd5e22-1893x1065.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Based on a multi-timeframe analysis, Egrag believes XRP is showing considerable strength, hinting at a potential surge to $1.4. The analyst elucidated his predictions in a tweet, stating, “XRP Color Code To $1.4 – UPDATE: Trying to showcase the sheer strength and achievements of XRP from multiple time frames: Weekly, 3D, 1D, and 4H.” XRP Price Analysis: 1-Week Chart Delving into the Weekly Chart, Egrag finds an evident optimistic momentum. XRP is on the brink of achieving a notable milestone: sealing a full-body candle beyond the Fib 0.618 retracement level at $0.5119. Egrag notes that the imminent week’s closure and the definitive form of the candle would serve as a robust affirmation of this trend. Egrag’s meticulous breakdown pinpoints vital landmarks for the XRP price trajectory in the 1-week chart. The wicking range is demarcated between $0.3875 and $0.4719. Any downward breach below $0.3875 might disrupt the broader chart setup. Related Reading: XRP, Polygon See Month-High Volumes As Investors Show FOMO Meanwhile, the ranging region, where XRP could oscillate without clear directional momentum (and which XRP is currently leaving), is situated between $0.4719 and $0.5119. Eclipsing the $0.5119 boundary in the weekly timeframe propels XRP into a bullish domain, leading up to $0.5738 — in sync with the 50% Fibonacci retracement echelon. The crypto analyst postulates that the breach of this pivotal price level could catalyze a sweeping XRP rally. Venturing past the 50% Fibonacci zone might result in a landscape with scant resistance, potentially allowing XRP to shatter its annual peak at $0.9310. Concluding his extensive analysis, Egrag envisages an audacious endgame: a staggering 250% rally, propelling XRP towards the 1,618 Fibonacci extension at $1.4695. Shorter Time Frames Switching focus to the 3-day chart, XRP displays a body candle close above the Fibonacci 0.618 retracement level, indicating its presence in the bullish zone. Yet, the current shape of the candle is a neutral Harami style, leaving room for interpretation and lacking a decisive forward direction. Related Reading: XRP Price Breakout: This Resistance Level Holds The Key This particular formation, rooted in the Japanese term for “pregnant,” represents a potential inflection point in the price movement. Yet, its neutrality necessitates waiting for more concrete signals. Egrag emphasizes that the impending candle, closing today, might shed light on pivotal insights. In the 1-day Chart, the narrative is more assertive. XRP has successfully wrapped up seven consecutive daily candles beyond the Fib 0.618 benchmark in the green area. This trend, as Egrag postulates, radiates a palpable bullish aura. But he also advises vigilance for a potential retest of the lower boundary of the bullish green area, which could solidify this foundation. Lastly, when inspecting the 4-hour chart, a discernible double-top pattern emerges. With XRP exhibiting resistance to surpass the $0.55 mark, there is heightened anticipation of a possible double bottom near $0.50. This movement could pave the way for an assault on the Fib 1.618 zone, around $0.576. The crypto analyst forecasts this as a precursor to a bullish continuation. At press time, XRP traded at $0.52073. The 1-hour chart shows $0.5264 as the current key resistance and $0.5197 as the key support.

42409600,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcLYav,1696595854,"U.S. Added 336K Jobs in September, Nearly Doubling Expectations; Bitcoin Slips 1%","It was blowout employment data for the economy last month, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics Friday morning reporting 336,000 jobs added in September versus economist forecasts for just 170,00. August’s originally reported 187,000 jobs gained was revised higher to 227,000.  The unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.8% and against expectations for a decline to 3.7%.  The price of bitcoin (BTC) fell just shy of 1% in the minutes following the news to $27,530.  Always an important report, this month’s jobs numbers have taken on particular significance given the rout in government bond prices over the past five weeks that’s seen the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rise from just above 4% to as high as 4.80% earlier this week. That sharp rise in rates has taken a sizable chunk out of the stock market, with the Nasdaq lower by about 6% since September 1 and the S&P 500 down a similar amount.  While not necessarily in major rally mode as stock and bond prices have tumbled, bitcoin has managed to hold its own, rising over the same time frame from about $26,000 to $27,700 ahead of this morning’s news.  Shortly following this morning's report, stock and bond prices were headed lower again, with Nasdaq 100 futures down more than 1% and the 10-year Treasury yield higher by eight basis points to just shy of 4.80%. The CME FedWatch tool now shows a 31% chance of a U.S. Federal Reserve rate hike at its next policy meeting in November. Ahead of the jobs number, it was just 24%.  In other report details, closely followed average hourly earnings were softer than expected, rising 0.2% in September versus forecasts for 0.3% and against August’s 0.2%.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Ether (ETH) and bitcoin (BTC) were buoyed to one-month highs last week as six ether futures ETFs went live in the U.S. on Monday, with traders expecting high demand for the products. However, their performance was pretty muted. Less than $2 million were traded across the various ETFs on Monday, with poor volumes throughout the week prompting analysts to write down their bullish outlook and pivot to bitcoin investments instead. The ether futures ETFs had 0.2% of trading volume compared to BTC futures day 1 of trading. Some analysts pointed to a lack of institutional demand for ether and others said it’s due to the macroeconomic environment. “Interest rates are at 5.5%, if you list any kind of ETF in this environment you are going to see low volumes,” said Sui Chung, CEO of CF Benchmarks, in an interview with CoinDesk. “It's the same with equities ETF volumes this week,"" added Chung. ""There might be more interest in ether futures ETFs as the macroeconomic situation changes but right now investors are too busy putting money into bank accounts.”  Blackbird Labs, an app and loyalty program that's attempting to connect restaurants and their customers via its crypto-powered app, announced on Wednesday it had raised a $24 million Series A led by the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). Through Blackbird, which is built on Coinbase's Layer-2 Base blockchain, customers tap their phone on a near field communication (NFC) reader (the devices which allow smartphones to connect to payment readers) and create a non-fungible token (NFT) membership. The NFT is then minted when users “tap in” to the restaurant.  FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried committed financial crimes, co-founder Gary Wang said after taking the stand late Thursday. Wang, the fourth witness called by the U.S. Department of Justice in Bankman-Fried’s trial, said he committed wire fraud, securities fraud and commodities fraud alongside Bankman-Fried and Caroline Ellison, who ran Bankman-Fried's Alameda Research hedge fund, and former FTX executive Nishad Singh. (Wang, Ellison and Singh all pleaded guilty to charges shortly after Bankman-Fried was arrested.) “We gave special privileges to Alameda Research to allow it to withdraw unlimited funds from FTX and lied about it,” Wang said.

18442896,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554370,1696593656,Dogecoin Under Pressure: Will Bearish Momentum Push Meme Coin Below $0.06?,"Dogecoin (DOGE) finds itself at a critical juncture. The $0.06 support level, a longstanding stronghold for buyers since early June, now faces increasing selling pressure that could potentially send DOGE sinking below this key level. Support and resistance zones, like the $0.06 mark, are pivotal in assessing the direction of price movements in the crypto world, as they often dictate the market sentiment. In recent months, DOGE has weathered a bearish trend, but this vital support level has managed to hold firm and mitigate the extent of the downtrend. Nevertheless, multiple retests of the support zone have raised concerns about DOGE’s weakening structure, signaling an opportunity for bears to capitalize on the situation. Related Reading: Trillions In Shiba Inu On The Move: What Lies Ahead For The Meme Coin? Dogecoin Price And Technical Indicators As of the latest data from CoinGecko, DOGE is currently trading at $0.061140, showing a modest 0.4% gain over the last 24 hours but a 1.2% dip over the past seven days. Two technical indicators, the On Balance Volume (OBV) and the Relative Strength Index (RSI), provide further insight into the market’s dynamics. The OBV, which had been on an uptrend in October, has recently exhibited a drop in trading volume. This decline suggests that selling pressure has intensified in the past few hours, causing concern among investors. DOGE reached a market cap $8.6 billion today. Chart: TradingView.com The RSI, another crucial indicator, has dipped below the neutral 50 level, reaffirming the presence of selling pressure. These developments put DOGE at a pivotal crossroads, with both short-term bullish and bearish scenarios in play. According to a price report, if buyers can successfully defend the $0.06 support level, DOGE could see a short-term target range of $0.064 to $0.067. However, if sellers manage to breach this critical support, their near-term target becomes $0.055, potentially deepening the bearish sentiment. Market Volatility Vs. Derivatives Trading In addition to the price fluctuations, the Dogecoin market has been marked by considerable volatility lately. Yet, despite the turbulence, new derivatives traders have remained conspicuously absent. Source: Coinalyze DOGE’s futures Open Interest (OI) has been hovering in the $232 million to $222 million range for the past week. Typically, rising open interest indicates an influx of new capital into the market, which often solidifies prevailing trends. However, the current trend suggests trader indifference, possibly due to the uncertainty surrounding DOGE’s immediate future. Related Reading: Assessing Cardano’s Struggles: Will Key Support Levels Halt The Decline Above $0.27? Traders should closely monitor whether the current key support can withstand the pressure, and the OBV and RSI indicators provide essential insights into the evolving market dynamics. The next few days will be crucial in determining whether DOGE can regain its bullish momentum or succumb to further bearish pressure.

18441257,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554376,1696590007,XRP News: Ripple CTO Defends Clawback Feature On The XRPL,"Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz, has always been quick to come to the defense of the crypto firm and its technology. This time, he has defended Ripple developers implementing a newly proposed ‘Clawback’ feature on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Why The Clawback Feature Is Necessary In a tweet shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Schwartz mentioned that while initially having reservations about the feature as he felt it was “redundant,” he later realized its importance as it differed from the existing freeze feature. The “clawback” amendment is now eligible for voting. This allowers issuers of new assets specifically created with this feature enabled to claw back a specified quantity of the asset from a holder. Some thoughts: … https://t.co/OmrerirRQz — David “JoelKatz” Schwartz (@JoelKatz) October 2, 2023 As the name suggests, the Clawback feature allows a token issuer to “claw back” tokens when there is fraudulent activity or for recovery purposes, like when a user loses access to their account. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investment Strategy: Analyst Sets Hefty Exit Price He noted that the clawback feature was primarily to be used to fulfill legal obligations, as in the case of a stablecoin issue fulfilling their redemption obligations or where a court order necessitates the need to use such a feature. From this premise, he explained that this feature ensures that this event is represented on the ledger, unlike the freeze feature, which doesn’t highlight why an asset was frozen. As such, this latest feature allows for better accountability and makes audits less complex. Furthermore, he mentioned that the freeze feature was more of a “nuclear” option, unlike the clawback feature, which does less damage and can seen as a viable and probably better alternative. Schwartz reiterated that this clawback didn’t apply to XRP and suggested that it was an option for stablecoin issuers, noting that other “blockchains that have stablecoins on them have some version of this clawback feature” and how it helped solved an accountability problem. Token price retains $0.52 support | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com XRP Ledger Feature Receives Cold Reception Despite Schwartz’s justification of the feature, many still showed displeasure with it as it undermined the ethos of decentralization and users’ privacy. One X user (@bigcjat) explained that a clawback feature seemed more drastic, unlike the freeze feature, as the former stripped users of their tokens, unlike the latter, where the user still maintained control of his tokens. He went on to quiz whether this token was simply proposed because of the ‘recent partnership’ considering that the feature was never proposed before now. He then suggested that the crypto firm and its blockchain may have been compromised as he stated, “Money taints, even decentralized ledgers. In response, Schwartz stated that, to the best of his knowledge, the driving force behind this feature was to ensure accountability as it would reflect the legal obligation of an issuer. He is not aware of anyone stating that they will only partner with Ripple if the XRPL supports clawback. Other users weighed in on the conversation, with some showing support for the feature, stating that stablecoin issuers needed to implement such a feature. On the other hand, others argued that the clawback feature wasn’t necessary, with a particular user stating that this risk is “akin to being SIM swapped.” Another concern raised is that token issuers could use this feature maliciously, especially when experiencing financial difficulties. That particular user gave an example of FTX being able to claw back their FTT tokens or a stablecoin issuer like Tether clawing back their USDT tokens in the event of financial difficulty. Related Reading: Analyst Who Put Bitcoin Price At $130,000 Says You Should Buy BTC Now, Here’s Why The X user @bigcjat once again came into the conversation and noted that Schwartz’s talks about “legal obligation” only undermine the essence of blockchain technology as there was no need for a ledger if the “actual value” and “rules” were off the ledger. However, Schwartz noted “several benefits” to putting these transactions on the ledger. One of them is that a public blockchain ensures that “the total legal obligations of the issuer can be completely public in a verifiable way.” The clawback feature will still need to be voted on by validators on the XRP Ledger before it becomes implemented. Once implemented, stablecoin issuers must decide to enable it before they can create their tokens on the network.

42409598,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcLYR0,1696586400,Sam Bankman-Fried's Lawyers Test the Judge's Patience,"It could take six weeks for prosecutors to make their case against Sam Bankman-Fried. But only three days were needed for the judge overseeing his trial to lose patience with the former crypto chief’s defense team.  Judge Lewis Kaplan was visibly and audibly disgruntled and mightily displeased with Mark Cohen & Co. on Thursday. On multiple occasions the white-haired federal judge chastised the defense attorneys for asking imprecise and repetitive questions of government witnesses. During one especially aggravating cross-examination he called the attorneys over for a sidebar slap-down.  “I’ve given you a lot of latitude, but” the repetitive questioning “needs to be curbed,” the 78 year-old judge told defense attorney Chris Everdell as he probed Adam Yedidia, a former friend and employee of Sam and now a witness for the prosecution.  You're reading The SBF Trial, a CoinDesk newsletter bringing you daily insights from inside the courtroom where Sam Bankman-Fried will try to stay out of prison. Want to receive it directly? Sign up here.  Kaplan’s displeasure with the defense team underscores the difficulties they face when mounting their two-pronged campaign to secure a “not guilty” verdict from the jury. First, they must use cross-examination to undermine government witnesses’ credibility in jurors’ eyes. Second, they must inject Sam’s most favorable facts into the court record by asking witnesses questions that don’t get shot down at a cringe-worthy frequency.  There was plenty of cringe in the courtroom as the defense tried questioning Yedidia, the government’s first spicy witness, to share insider knowledge of crypto exchange FTX and its downfall.  Yedidia had been called to testify about a bug in FTX’s accounting software that caused it to wildly overstate how much money Alameda Research owed exchange customers: $16 billion instead of the real debt, which was half of that. Of course, even $8 billion missing from customers’ accounts was a big problem, too. (Alameda was FTX’s banking gateway during the exchange’s early days. Customers wired their money to the trading firm and then got credited in their FTX account. The messy, “secret” arrangement was one factor in FTX’s subsequent loss of $8 billion in customer funds, according to prosecutors.)  The defense offered a different take. In its opening arguments lawyers characterized Alameda’s banking relationship with FTX as no secret and its loss of customer money as nothing criminal – though perhaps really, really dumb (from a risk management perspective, that is). They want to get that line across to the jury.  Sam’s lawyers appear to be injecting that effort into their cross-examination, where they’ve been asking witnesses questions whose answer they want to be yes. For Yedidia, this included questions about who could use FTX as an exchange (objection), how hard people were working (objection) and whether the witness “thought that FTX was very well run” (ob- erm, well, you know the drill).  Thing is, prosecutors have any number of procedural ways to block such questions from entering the record – and also from letting their witnesses answer it. Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon objected to the above questions and Judge Kaplan sustained them. Most of Thursday’s 84 objections landed against the defense.  Sometimes Kaplan sustained prosecutors’ objections even before they’d lodged them. Sometimes he did so sounding exasperated. At one point he spent a minute staring at the ceiling. At another, he chastised the defense attorneys for being, well, stupid.  “Do you recall seeing a Toyota Corolla,” Everdell asked Yedidia in an attempt to underscore that Sam didn’t blow his wealth (or was it his customers’ wealth?) on expensive things that go vroom. “Objection!” cried Prosecutor Sasson.  “I don't think there’s anybody in the room who has never seen a Toyota Corolla, so let's get on with it,” Kaplan said, eliciting the day’s biggest laugh from the gallery.  The judge himself drives a BMW X7. I saw him wheeling off into the late afternoon traffic Thursday wearing sunglasses and what appeared to be french cuffs.  His license plate read: “USJ 1.”  What we're expecting  FTX co-founder and former chief technology officer Gary Wang has already taken the stand, getting in about 40 minutes or so of testimony at the end of the day Thursday. He’s probably going to spend quite a bit more time on Friday discussing his role in overseeing FTX, and more specifically the backdoor that allowed Alameda to access FTX customer funds.  While the judge is clearly not thrilled with how the defense is proceeding so far, the real question is how will the jury take it. Even though the judge sustained objections to several defense questions, the mere fact that defense attorneys raised questions hinting at issues with witnesses’ credibility may leave a lasting impression.  Similarly, the fact that Yedidia – the former FTX developer – said he lost his belief in the company because “FTX defrauded all its customers” is probably going to leave an emotional mark that may be difficult to overcome, even if the defense and judge immediately asked to strike the line from the record.  We are seeing the DOJ’s strategy continue to play out – and again, it seems almost laser-focused on this emotional appeal. We heard from Matt Huang – who admittedly may not be a super-sympathetic figure, as a fairly well-off venture capitalist – who told the jury that his firm marked down $278 million of investments in FTX to zero.  And now we’re hearing from Wang, who just very loudly opened up his testimony by saying yes, he committed crimes and he did that with Bankman-Fried and the rest of the FTX inner circle.  On a logistical note: Wang’s testimony will conclude Friday. Prosecutors expect to wrap up midway through what will be an abbreviated day. Depending on cross-examinations, we may or may not hear from the next witness, BlockFi’s Zac Prince, later today. Otherwise, he and Elan Dekel, a vice president at a company called Pinecone, are expected to begin testifying next week.

18437947,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554326,1696582819,Bitcoin And Crypto Under The Lens As Bond Market Recalls 2008 Crash,"As the global financial landscape witnesses a seismic shift, reminiscent of the 2008 financial crisis and the dot-com bubble burst, alarm bells are ringing in the bond market, alerting the Bitcoin and crypto market as well. Is A Crash Like 2008 Looming? Renowned Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA), Genevieve Roch-Decter, highlighted the striking parallels in a recent tweet, stating, “I can’t believe I am saying this but the slump in 10-year and 30-year bonds is approaching the epic drops we saw in stocks during the 2008 financial crisis and the dot-com bubble bust.” Bloomberg Surveillance’s Lisa Abramowicz reinforces this grim narrative, pointing out that “bonds maturing in 10 years or more have slumped 46% since peaking in March 2020, just shy of the 49% plunge in US stocks in the aftermath of the dot-com bust. The route in 30-year bonds has been even worse, tumbling 53%.” Onramp, a Bitcoin asset management platform, adds further context by emphasizing the historic nature of the trend. This decline, particularly in bonds with maturities exceeding a decade, harkens back to market downturns like the dot-com bubble collapse. The Federal Reserve’s resolute stance on inflation and a fragile fiscal environment have disrupted the traditional appeal of long-maturity debt, raising questions about the possibility of a debt spiral. The situation is further complicated by the behavior of the yield curve. Historically, an inverted yield curve has foreshadowed recessions. However, the recent correction has seen a rare “bear steepener,” marked by rising long-term yields. This phenomenon, seen in the past before recessions, raises concerns of an impending economic downturn. Related Reading: This Trader Thinks Bitcoin Is Undervalued Below $30,000: Time To Buy More BTC? “While some question the yield curve’s reliability as a recession indicator, the current bear steepening suggests that an economic downturn could be imminent. This is particularly concerning given the Fed’s ongoing commitment to restrictive monetary policy, making the situation ripe for potential market volatility and economic uncertainty, “ Dylan LeClair from Onramp notes. Meanwhile, Barclays’ analyst Ajay Rajadhyaksha suggests that only a stock market crash could halt the bond market’s decline. Unlike previous cycles, traditional bond backstops are dwindling, with the Fed shifting from a net buyer to a net seller, and foreign institutional buying slowing. This highlights the stark disconnect between equity valuations and long-end bond rates, with stocks having significant room for devaluation before bonds stabilize. And if stocks crash, Bitcoin and crypto could be just as affected. Impact On Bitcoin And Crypto The turmoil in the bond market has far-reaching implications, including its impact on Bitcoin and crypto. Remarkably, the crypto market has never experienced such a situation, but there are general observations of how risk assets have reacted in such environments in the past. First, rising treasury yields make risk-free returns more attractive, potentially prompting some investors to reallocate capital from risk assets like Bitcoin and crypto to treasury bills. This shift could decrease demand, putting downward pressure on their prices. Related Reading: Arthur Hayes Predicts Bitcoin Price To Hit $750,000, Here’s When Moreover, a sharp rise in 10-year Treasury yields can signal a tighter monetary policy, weighing on risk assets. Higher yields also mean higher borrowing costs, which can impact crypto. When interest rates rise, non-interest-bearing assets like Bitcoin may seem less attractive compared to yield-bearing assets. A significant increase in Treasury yields can also lead to reduced liquidity in other financial markets, such as the Bitcoin and crypto space. Institutional investors facing liquidity constraints may liquidate more liquid assets like BTC and altcoins causing potential price declines. Lastly, sharp yield increases can create volatility across various asset classes as investors seek to reduce risk or cover losses elsewhere. Bitcoin and crypto are highly influenced by market sentiment and speculative behavior. The market’s interpretation of rising yields can sway investor behavior, impacting crypto prices. Accordingly, Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, recently predicted: The 10YR is up another 10% since! The Fed wants more unemployment. The job market is still too strong. They’ve raised the expected 2024 rates as a result and the 10YR has broken out to new decade highs. As long as the 10YR is breaking upwards like this, risk assets are going to see further headwinds.

18435399,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554325,1696577297,Assessing Cardano’s Struggles: Will Key Support Levels Halt The Decline Above $0.27?,"Cardano (ADA) has been on a rollercoaster ride in the cryptocurrency market, with its recent price recovery rally encountering some significant challenges. As of the latest data from CoinGecko, ADA is trading at $0.261, showing a modest 1.7% gain in the past 24 hours, but boasting a seven-day rally of 4.9%. However, beneath the surface, there are signs of growing overhead pressure that could limit ADA’s upward momentum. ADA’s journey to reclaim its previous highs faces its first major hurdle at the $0.26 mark. But this is just the beginning, as multiple layers of resistance lie above it, signifying significant supplier congestion levels. The price recovery may be stalling due to these formidable barriers. Related Reading: Solana Price On Fire: October Red-Hot Prediction – $30 Within Reach? Cardano: Key Insights To gain a deeper understanding of ADA’s current price dynamics, we turn to a new price analysis. Data reveals a crucial level of buying interest at $0.25. In fact, over 600,000 ADA buy limit orders are placed at this level. This suggests that if ADA can breach the range-high and the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), it might find support around the mid-range of $0.25. On the sell side, key sell limit orders start to emerge between $0.265 and $0.270, indicating that there is substantial selling pressure just above the current price levels. ADA market cap currently at $9.1 billion. Chart: TradingView.com The fate of ADA’s price also hinges on Bitcoin’s performance. Should Bitcoin post losses and dip below $27,500, ADA could follow suit, potentially finding support at the mid-range of $0.25. Conversely, a bullish rally in Bitcoin could set the stage for ADA to re-target its next hurdle at $0.28. Related Reading: XRP Battle With Resistance: Could A Crucial Update Propel The Altcoin Forward? Technical Indicators Signal Caution Technical indicators are also raising caution flags for ADA investors. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently below the 50 level and trending downward, indicating fading momentum. Furthermore, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) remains in negative territory, signaling a lack of bullish sentiment. ADA Global In/Out of the Money (GIOM) metric. Source: IntoTheBlock/FXStreet Descent To Range Low Likely Considering the current market conditions and technical indicators, analysts are leaning towards a bearish outlook for Cardano’s price. There is a possibility that ADA could descend to test the support floor at $0.2415. In a worst-case scenario, the price could plummet further, potentially reaching the range low of $0.2200, marking a substantial 15% drop from its current levels. While Cardano has shown resilience with its recent gains, the road ahead is riddled with resistance levels, and Bitcoin’s influence remains a significant factor. Investors should closely monitor the developments in ADA’s price, as it navigates through these challenging market conditions. The cryptocurrency landscape is as unpredictable as ever, and ADA’s journey is far from certain. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice. Investing involves risk.

42409605,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcLYkq,1696576649,Ethereum Has Become More Centralized Since the Merge and Shanghai Upgrades: JPMorgan,"The rise in ether (ETH) staking since the Merge and Shanghai upgrades has come at a cost to Ethereum as the network has become more centralized and the overall staking yield has fallen, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report on Thursday.  “Many in the crypto community had seen Lido, a decentralized liquid staking platform as a better alternative compared to the centralized liquid staking platforms associated with centralized exchanges,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.  Lido has been adding more node operators to contain the number of staked ether being controlled by any single operator, to address centralization concerns, the Wall Street bank noted.  Still, centralization by any entity or protocol creates risks for Ethereum as a “concentrated number of liquidity providers or node operators could act as a single point of failure or become targets for attacks or collude to create an oligopoly that would promote their own interests at the expense of the interests of the community,” the report added.  An added risk from the rise of liquid staking is rehypothecation, the bank said. This is when liquidity tokens are reused as collateral across numerous decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols at the same time. DeFi is an umbrella term used for lending, trading and other financial activities carried out on a blockchain.  “Rehypothecation could then result in a cascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value or is hacked or slashed due to malicious attack or a protocol error,” the note said.  The increase in staking has also reduced the appeal of ether from a “yield perspective,” especially given the backdrop of rising yields in traditional financial assets, the report added. The total staking yield has dropped from 7.3% before the Shanghai upgrade to about 5.5%.

Ether and bitcoin were buoyed to one-month highs last week as six ETH ETFs went live in the U.S. earlier on Monday, with traders expecting high demand for the products.  However, their performance told a different story. Less than $2 million were traded across the various ETFs on Monday, with poor volumes throughout the week prompting analysts to write down their bullish outlook and pivot to bitcoin investments instead.  Such sentiment weighed on prices, with ether losing nearly all gains since the past week, while bitcoin has generally hovered above support levels.

42392391,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6DAD,1696573481,THORSwap Pauses Platform After Series of FTX Hack-Linked Trades,"THORSwap exchange said on Friday it would shift into “maintenance” mode after a series of illicitly-linked funds were passed through the platform in the past several days – including several transactions originating from the infamous ""FTX Exploiter"" wallet that drained funds from Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX exchange in the days following its bankruptcy last year.  And according to one blockchain sleuth, Lookonchain, the exploiter has since started – early Friday – swapping ether (ETH) into the Threshold Network's tBTC tokens, a bridged form of bitcoin (BTC).  A THORSwap developer said the team “stands firmly against any and all criminal actions” in a message to CoinDesk.  “Yesterday, following a careful evaluation of the situation and consultation with advisors, legal counsel and law enforcement, the decision was made to temporarily transition the THORSwap interface into maintenance mode,” THORSwap developers said in a tweet.  “This action was taken to swiftly curtail any further potential illicit activity. THORSwap will remain in this mode until a more permanent and robust solution can be implemented to ensure the platform's continued security and integrity,” they added.  The move effectively pauses trading operations. However, services such as lending, borrowing and staking actions are all fully operational.  THORSwap runs on THORChain, a network that allows users to freely trade tokens between different blockchains.  In November 2022, hours after FTX and its related companies filed for bankruptcy, an unknown party managed to drain various wallets of as much as $600 million.  Last week, the hacker, whose identity remains unknown to this date, managed to pass over 15,000 ether using various platforms, including THORSwap. The funds' sudden movement on the eve of Bankman-Fried's criminal trial this week in a federal court in New York has deepened one of the ongoing mysteries around the exchange's collapse last year.

The price could decline heavily below the $210 and $202 support levels. Binance coin price is slowly moving lower from the $220 resistance against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $215 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $214.5 on the 4-hour chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair might accelerate lower if it breaks the $210 support level. Binance Coin Price Remains At Risk This past week, BNB price attempted a recovery wave above the $210 level. The price was able to clear the $215 resistance zone. However, it failed to clear the $220 resistance. There was a fresh decline in BNB, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price declined below the $215 support level. The bears pushed the price below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $207 swing low to the $221 high. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $214.5 on the 4-hour chart of the BNB/USD pair. The price is now trading below $215 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). It is consolidating near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $207 swing low to the $221 high. If there is a recovery wave, the price could face resistance near the $213 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). Source: BNBUSD on TradingView.com The next resistance sits near the $215 level. A clear move above the $215 zone could send the price further higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test the main resistance at $220-$222. A close above the $222 resistance might set the pace for a larger increase toward the $250 resistance. More Losses in BNB? If BNB fails to clear the $215 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $210 level. The next major support is near the $207 level. If there is a downside break below the $207 support, the price could drop toward the $202 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $165 level. Technical Indicators 4-Hours MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is gaining pace in the bearish zone. 4-Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BNB/USD is currently below the 50 level.

ETH must clear the $1,650 resistance to start a recovery wave. Ethereum is struggling to stay above the $1,600 support zone. The price is trading below $1,650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,645 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $1,650 and $1,665 resistance levels. Ethereum Price Grinds Lower Ethereum attempted a recovery wave from the $1,630 zone. ETH climbed above the $1,650 resistance level but upsides were limited, like Bitcoin. The price struggled to gain pace for a move above the $1,665 resistance level. A high was formed near $1,654 and the price reacted to the downside. It declined below the $1,620 support and even traded close to the $1,600 level. A low is formed near $1,607 and the price is now consolidating losses. Ethereum is now trading below $1,650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,645 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1,630 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,654 swing high to the $1,607 low. The next major resistance is $1,650, the trend line, and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The trend line is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,654 swing high to the $1,607 low. A close above the $1,650 resistance might send the price toward the key resistance at $1,665. Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com To start a steady increase, Ether must settle above the $1,650 and $1,665 levels. The next key resistance might be $1,720. Any more gains might open the doors for a move toward $1,750. More Losses in ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,650 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,610 level. The next key support is $1,600. The first major support is now near $1,585. A downside break below the $1,585 support might start another strong decline. In the stated case, the price could decline toward the $1,540 level. Any more losses may perhaps send Ether toward the $1,500 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.
