Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $11,857 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 1.3% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $11,568-$11,891  BTC above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin is on the uptrend, going as high as $11,891 with buyers outnumbering sellers in the market Thursday. ”This is similar to what we saw on Sunday, Aug. 9 – a quick move from $11,500 to $12,000 and then back to $11,300,” said John Willock, CEO of crypto asset manager Tritum. “Maybe we've got $13,500 in the next phase up in the coming days,” he added.      Read More: Bitcoin Risks Deeper Drop if Dollar Rebounds      David Lifchitz, chief investment officer for quant trading firm ExoAlpha, expects a bitcoin price bull run to proceed should it overcome a nearby hurdle. “All in all, $12,500 is the key level to watch for a sustainable breakout on strong volume,” he said. ”Anything different will be a fake, as it can be seen many times in a historical chart of BTC/USD.”      In the bitcoin options market, open interest (the number of outstanding contracts) is starting to level off after passing the $2 billion mark for the first time since July.      Juicy returns in the DeFi market are making traders lose interest in options, according to Viashl Shah, founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5. “Every derivatives trader that was looking for incremental yield and levered returns has been besotted by the magnitude of moves in DeFi,” Shah told CoinDesk. “So, naturally, cost of capital dictates at least some attention that way.”      Read More: Stablecoin Demand May Drop if Traders Abandon Bitcoin ‘Cash and Carry’    Bitcoin on DeFi doubles in August    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Thursday, trading around $415 and climbing 4% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Read More: Algorand’s Move Into DeFi Gives ALGO Price a Boost      At the start of the year, the number of bitcoin locked in decentralized finance, or DeFi, stood at 1,453 BTC. That amount is now up to 48,922 BTC as of Thursday. In August alone, bitcoin in DeFi has more than doubled from 20,890 BTC at the first of the month. Decentralized finance is giving investors new avenues to generate income, or “yield,” and, as a result, bitcoin owners have over $570 million worth of BTC at current prices locked in the DeFi ecosystem.      Michael Gord, co-founder of trading firm Global Digital Assets, says many traders are taking gains and buying more bitcoin given the potential ephemeral nature of DeFi. “I’d assume that DeFi profits are being put back into BTC as the safe asset,” he told CoinDesk. “DeFi long term will revolutionize finance, but this short-term bubble is bound to pop eventually, in my opinion.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly in the green Thursday.

Shaken by weeks of damaging hacks, ETC Labs rolled out on Wednesday a series of immediate security changes and long-term proposals that it says will bolster Ethereum Classic, the origin chain of Ethereum.  For now, the blockchain-supporting organization will move to stabilize Ethereum Classic's plummeting hashrate, increase network monitoring, coordinate closely with exchanges and deploy a finality arbitration system.  These immediate fixes will shore up Ethereum Classic in the short-term, ETC Labs said. More wide-ranging patches that all require community consensus are now in development and thus will take more time.

42384452,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAXYod,1597944710,"Ready to Wumbo: LND Enables More, Larger Bitcoin Transactions on Lightning","Bitcoin's Lightning Network has reached a significant milestone. An important capacity limit meant to protect users of the nascent protocol is being tweaked, toppling a barrier to entry for companies looking to adopt the novel payment system.      LND, a leading Lightning Network implementation from startup Lightning Labs, has announced it has adopted support for wumbo channels. Going forward, users can deposit more money into Lightning Network channels than before, as well as send larger transactions.      Read more: What Is Bitcoin’s Lightning Network?      ACINQ's eclair and Blockstream's c-lightning both adopted a form of wumbo earlier this year. According to LND's fresh release notes, the node software now allows users to opt into ""accepting"" and ""creating"" wumbo channels.    What is wumbo?    The word ""wumbo"" comes from, believe it or not, SpongeBob SquarePants, a cartoon series about a talking sponge that works at a burger joint under the sea with an assortment of sea friends. In one scene, SpongeBob's starfish friend Patrick Star teaches him the word ""wumbo.""      ""You wumbo, I wumbo,"" Star says, pointing to Spongebob, then himself. Lightning's ""wumbo"" is similar in that two users have to agree to wumbo before they wumbo.      There are two parts to wumbo. The first part removes the limit to the total amount of bitcoin that can be held in a channel: This limit is currently capped at 0.16777215 BTC, worth about $1,988 at press time. The second strips away the limit to how large an individual payment can be: That limit has been 0.04294967 BTC, worth about $508 at press time.      Read more: This Spongebob-Themed Tech Proves That Bitcoin’s Lightning Is Advancing      Wumbo isn't technically difficult; in fact, it's very simple. With wumbo channel support, a user can signal he or she wants to go beyond the aforementioned limits and find other nodes to connect to that also support higher limits.      Developers added the limitation to protect users from pouring too much money into Lightning, as it's still a new and experimental technology. As such, one reason wumbo is a big deal is it is a sign that the payment technology is maturing.      ""We view shipping wumbo in LND as a sign that the software has progressed to a certain point where advanced users, companies, and node operators can open larger channels. These larger wumbo channels enable a better user experience with larger transactions on the network and more efficient capital usage for startups and node operators,"" Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark told CoinDesk.      That's not to say they don't think people still need to be careful working with this new technology.      ""That said, we do not encourage people to go all 'DeFi' on Lightning (looking at you, YAM), as we believe people should balance the risks of deploying capital on a new protocol that could have bugs with the benefits of larger channel sizes,"" Stark added.    Why wumbo?    Average Lightning users might not be impacted much by wumbo. If they're using the Lightning Network to send small amounts, then this lift on capacity won't make a difference to them.      Larger entities such as business or exchanges, on the other hand, might want to take advantage of a larger capacity.      ""Most users can likely get by without wumbo channels, but larger nodes or exchanges/services may really benefit from the ability to manage a smaller set of larger channels,"" LND developers explain in the release notes.      Read more: To Beat Online Censorship, We Need Anonymous Payments      That's why some developers think wumbo will take the Lightning Network to the next level. They think it will attract wider adoption of the Lightning Network among larger entities, making it accessible to more bitcoin users.      ""Most of the major node operators and startups run our LND implementation, so unless they’ve forked LND and added Wumbo themselves (which a few have, and this was riskier without official support), they would not have had this feature enabled,"" Stark said.      Still, some companies have already added support for wumbo without waiting for an official route to do so. As such, Acinq CEO Pierre-Marie Padiou is skeptical LND adding support for wumbo will make a huge difference.      ""It can't hurt, but larger nodes [...] have already switched, so the improvement has probably already taken place,"" he told CoinDesk.    Are we ready to wumbo?    Channel and transaction limits were put in place to protect users from potentially losing large amounts of bitcoin by sending it over an experimental network. What makes developers think Lightning is now ready to live without these limits?      ""I think we've gained experience, and with that comes confidence,"" said Blockstream engineer Rusty Russell, though he still expressed caution: ""As always, it's best to think of Lightning as your petty cash, rather than your life savings.""      Read more: Grasping Lightning: Mapping the Key Players in Bitcoin’s Next Phase      People have a choice – they obviously don't have to use the ballooned capacity that wumbo channels allow. ""With regard to security, with Eclair you can decide whether or not you decide to allow large channels and what the maximum channel size you accept [is]. We also scale the number of confirmations for the funding transaction depending on the amount of funds at stake,"" Padiou told CoinDesk.      Russell also pointed out that the payment limit of 0.16777215 BTC was far less valuable, equivalent to about $10 dollars, when it was originally proposed years ago. As bitcoin's price has increased over the last several years, this value limit has ballooned to almost $2,000. So, to a degree, the limit has naturally lifted over time.      ""So we got wumboed already without having to even put our belt on,"" Russell said, referencing the belt SpongeBob wears in the wumbo scene.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/08/20/ready-to-wumbo-lnd-enables-more-larger-bitcoin-transactions-on-lightning,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f5f3e19434a66ab0654efc1f58cfad95f6f12c8f-1200x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to the report published Tuesday, investors in Protocol Labs, a for-profit incubator of anticipated Web3 projects like IPFS and Filecoin, believe they are owed disbursements of Filecoin’s native token.      Filecoin raised about $205 million in a 2017 ICO, in which some – but not all – of Protocol Lab’s seed round backers participated. Axios reports Protocol Labs “retained a percentage of the tokens,” with regular distributions being made to CEO Juan Batiz-Benet and early employees, “which in theory would be value accruing to the equity investors.”      Unnamed parties are apparently in mediation over receiving a portion of these tokens, which could potentially delay Filecoin’s imminent launch next month if not resolved, reporters Dan Primack and Kia Kokalitcheva intuit.      Fortune’s Jeff John Roberts read the news and added this insight: Filecoin is a representation of the entire blockchain space where it is common to raise millions of dollars through novel funding mechanisms, and frequently, fail to deliver.      Part of the issue is, it’s hard building a new, open and fair version of the internet or the financial system. “But there is another reason to be skeptical, and that is the lack of incentive that blockchain companies have to succeed,” he writes.      Front-loaded with cash, it’s easier to “travel the world” rather than “toil over blockchain code,” Roberts writes.      While Filecoin is no stranger to delays (in February 2019, developers pushed back the launch of its first testnet. The mainnet had been estimated to deploy in the first quarter of 2019, then the second quarter, then to Q3/Q4 2019, then between July 20 and Aug. 21, 2020, now in a month), its network participants are less cynical.      Despite a year of delays, Filecoin has found an incentivized community in China, and has onboarded miners, after it emailed hard drives containing climate data to future (probable) network participants.      In Benet’s own words from Consensus: Distributed: “Web 3 is about creating a platform that is decentralized, that puts human rights foremost, and can build a much freer and open internet and lock it in place.”      Blockchain and cryptocurrency have already “changed the underlying guts and rails of major industries,” he said. But it hasn’t yet solved the dilemma between project developers and their investors.    Market intel    Greens & reds Bitcoin’s price pullback may worsen as the U.S. dollar shows signs of life. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against that of other reserve currencies, has jumped 1% to 93.000 in the past 24 hours – the biggest single-day rise in two months. This jump comes after July’s Federal Reserve meeting minutes show the central bank is not planning on implementing controversial yield curve controls on bonds. The correlation between bitcoin and the U.S. dollar has been historically weak but has picked up in the past month as investors look for alternative safe-haven assets, CoinDesk markets reporter Omkar Godbole writes.      Rendering Ren Prices for ren, the token for the RenVM DeFi network, surged by more than 100% over the past week. That’s because the total amount of renBTC, a tokenized bitcoin that is locked in RenVM, broke 10,000 on Monday, according to data collected by DeFi Pulse. The total value locked in RenVM jumped to more than $174 million on Monday from approximately $59.9 million a week earlier. There is a growing demand for having bitcoin (BTC) on the Ethereum blockchain as it is increasingly used in DeFi, CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen reports.    Tech pod    OMG! Fees! Tether has added its eighth blockchain, OMG Network, to help alleviate congestion on the popular rail Ethereum. OMG is touted as a scaling solution to handle thousands of transactions at a third of the cost of Ethereum, which is currently experiencing a record high gas fees, or the price to run transactions. The third-largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $13.1 billion is among the top Ethereum “gas guzzlers,” according to Ethgasstaion. CoinGecko data shows OMG tokens have increased 115% from $1.70 to $3.65 in the past seven days, as investors look to the network to escape climbing gas prices.    Op-ed    Gamifying gains Andrew Thurman, a content consultant for Chainlink Labs and an adviser to IdeaMarkets, thinks non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are immutable, immortal, resistant to theft, impossible to forge and “boring as dirt.” Crypto collectibles aren’t for everyone, but NFTs have properties that can be applied to a variety of games increasing the stakes and the fun. Although, “not all NFT projects need to introduce such elegantly designed systems to become more fun,” he writes.    Podcast corner    Real enough?

42432554,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNaLDh,1597929251,First Mover: Collapsing Bitcoin Futures Premium Offers Glimpse of New Digital Money Market,"Price Point    Bitcoin traded slightly higher early Thursday at $11,772 after falling for two straight days.      The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has declined 1.3% this week as the U.S. dollar strengthened in foreign exchange markets. The greenback gained support Wednesday as the Federal Reserve said it wasn't immediately planning to implement a ""yield curve control"" program that probably would have brought an accelerated pace of money printing.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      ""The corrective moves we witnessed are necessary for the market to cool down and catch a breath,"" Joe DiPasquale, CEO of the cryptocurrency investment firm BitBull Capital, told CoinDesk in an email. ""Moving forward, we can expect the market to lean on the support zone between $11,000 and $11,500 to consolidate and try another push above $12,000.""    Market Moves    Bitcoin's mini sell-off this week has revealed a key feature of fast-evolving cryptocurrency markets: How dollar-linked ""stablecoins"" are being used to fund exotic futures trades, similar to the way money markets serve as a vital lifeblood on Wall Street.      As flagged earlier this week by the Norwegian cryptocurrency-analysis firm Arcane Research, prices for bitcoin futures contracts on the Chicago-based CME exchange have been trading well above ""spot"" prices for the underlying security. That premium rose last week to 20%, the highest in five months, seen as a sign of just how bullish big investors have become on bitcoin.      This week's retreat in prices below $12,000 has led to a squeeze for traders who were attempting a ""cash and carry arbitrage,"" as reported Wednesday by CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole. It's a strategy in which traders buy bitcoin and then short futures contracts on the cryptocurrency, betting the prices will eventually converge and the premium will be pocketed as a profit.      The annualized premium dropped to 14% in under 48 hours as prices slid, and some traders rushed to unwind their arbitrage trades.      One lesson from the episode is that traders were apparently using stablecoins such as tether (USDT) to fund the trade, according to Godbole.      “Stablecoins are widely used as funding currencies, and there has been a high demand for these dollar-backed cryptocurrencies from institutions,” Skew CEO Emmanuel Goh told Godbole in a Telegram chat.    Bitcoin Watch    Bitcoin’s recent price pullback may worsen as the U.S. dollar shows signs of life on the back of minutes released Wednesday from the Federal Reserve's meeting in July.    The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback's value against that of other reserve currencies, has jumped 1% to 93 in the past 24 hours, the biggest single-day rise in two months.  USD has picked up on the news the Fed is not planning on implementing controversial yield curve controls on bonds – something markets had been anticipating.  The correlation between bitcoin and the dollar is historically weak. But in the past month there has been a growing inverse relationship between the two as more investors look for alternatives to the U.S. currency. Analysts with Goldman Sachs and some investors have warned the greenback's reserve-currency status might be at risk.  CoinDesk pricing data shows bitcoin rising from $9,000 to $12,400 in the four weeks through Aug. 17, just as the dollar index declined to 92 from 97.  But in the face of a strengthening dollar, bitcoin has fallen to around $11,780, down 5% from a 2020 high reached earlier this week.  Continued recovery in the dollar could yield further losses for bitcoin, but a sustained rebound in the U.S. currency still looks unlikely. Interest rates likely to remain close to zero to stimulate the economy, and inflation-adjusted yields are trading at negative levels; analysts at Deutsche Bank and elsewhere say the Fed might be forced to undertake more radical monetary measures.    – Omkar Godbole    Token Watch    Ren (REN) is benefiting from rising demand for tokenized bitcoin in DeFi: Prices for the Ren token have doubled in the past few days. Like other protcols designed to produce synthetic version of cryptocurrencies, RenVM takes bitcoins and produces an ERC-20 token called renBTC that can be used in Ethereum-based applications. More than 10,000 of the tokenized bitcoin, renBTC, were locked on Monday, according to DeFi Pulse. RenBTC currently represents about 21.7% of the tokenized bitcoin market, ranking it second behind wrapped bitcoin (WBTC).      Rates to borrow the Synthetix stablecoin sUSD monetarily spiked to almost 50% Wednesday on Aave's decentralized lending platform. The cause? According to Stani Kulechov, chief executive of Aave, users were clamoring for the dollar-linked sUSD tokens to send to Curve, so they could participate win that protocol's CRV tokens via ""yield farming."" Prices for CRV were trading at $4.35 at the time of writing, up 14.8% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko. As Arcane Research put it earlier this week, it's a ""summer of crazy returns"" in "" exuberant DeFi.""      Aave (LEND) is seeing a surge in transactions to go with its 2020 price jump: ""Despite growing criticism about the actual value locked being significantly smaller than reported in DeFi Pulse, on-chain activity for these protocols and their tokens demonstrate thriving activity,"" according to a post Wednesday by the crypto-intelligence firm IntoTheBlock on CoinMarketCap.com's blog . The decentralized lender's token is up 29-fold this year, for a market valuation of $700 million, inspiring incredulity. The bull case is that ""there is no denying that these innovations have the potential to redefine finance as we know it,"" IntoTheBlock wrote. CoinDesk's Will Foxley reported last week that Aave plans to work the firm RealT to tokenize home mortgages.      -Muyao Shen    Analogs - on the economy and traditional finance    Federal Reserve officials saw need for more stimulus at last month's meeting (Fed)      Asset bubble isn't really bubble; it's rational due to easy Fed monetary policy.

42432541,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNaKnh,1597928719,Ethereum-Based MadNetwork Aims to Clean Up Advertising's 'Programmatic Cesspool',"There’s a joke in the world of digital advertising: How many companies does it take to put an ad on a website?      In fact, there can be as many as 15 intermediaries participating in this opaque process, sponging up around 30% of the advertising spend. To fix this broken system, the next generation of adtech specialists are again pinning their hopes on blockchain technology.      Announced Thursday, MadNetwork, a permissioned layer running on top of Ethereum while using the public blockchain itself as its immutable system of record, emerges from stealth with a testnet coming next month.      Adtech provider MadHive and advertising industry consortium AdLedger had previously piloted an entire system of data sharing and accounting on Ethereum, but over the past couple of years they decided a Layer 2 approach was needed in order to scale.      Blockchain is often used to help automate manual or paper-based processes, but in the case of advertising, it’s the system of automation itself that’s the problem. The first iteration of hastily-erected programmatic web advertising – a mish-mash of servers and accounting platforms – has led to a black box riddled with fees and inconsistencies.    ‘Programmatic cesspool’    The time is right for blockchain transparency to cut through the Gordian Knot of programmatic advertising, particularly as traditional broadcast television makes the transition to the world of connected devices, said MadNetwork project lead Adam Helfgott.      “An NBC or a Fox can’t really afford to lose 30% of their television media revenue into this like programmatic cesspool,” said Helfgott. “These legacy media companies are used to having a very clean transaction, and not all this black-boxy programmatic stuff in the middle.”      The AdLedger blockchain consortium, of which MadHive is a member, includes some heavyweight media players such as Viacom, Publicis Media, Hearst Television, IPG Mediabrands, Hershey and also IBM. (Back in 2018, AdLedger did a pilot with IBM, which committed some advertising budget to a system running on Big Blue’s preferred blockchain, Hyperledger Fabric.)      Read more: IBM-Backed Blockchain Trial Takes Aim at Advertising’s Middlemen      As well as clarifying where intermediary systems impinge, MadNetwork’s blockchain also helps provide insights into the programmatic supply chain in the era of oncoming data privacy regulation, said Christiana Cacciapuoti, a MadNetwork business strategy advisor and the executive director of AdLedger.      “We are seeing a greater demand for insights into which data is going to which players and from which consumers, and who got that consent and how it’s being passed around,” said Cacciapuoti. “Just as that [blockchain-based] system of accounting can track the transfer of dollars and the business-outcome angle, it can also track data transfer and take account of privacy angles.”    Touchpoint of truth    The revamped Layer 2 solution on Ethereum uses the public mainnet as a “touchpoint of truth,” said Helfgott, likening it to the Baseline Protocol built by John Wolpert of ConsenSys and Paul Brody of EY.

Binance's DeFi staking program was first announced Wednesday with dai, the stablecoin generated by loans on MakerDAO. The Binance initiative aims to tap into this year's booming DeFi market by offering the ability for users earn staking rewards (akin to interest) on select digital assets.      On Thursday, Binance added kava as the second asset to its staking product. Kava is a DeFi platform backed by Binance, Huobi and OKEx with a native token by the same name.      In a statement to CoinDesk, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said:    ""Our users have been requesting Binance.com giving them access to DeFi. Binance prioritizes user experience and in the spirit of the community, Binance.com now offers direct integration into these DeFi products allowing the products' value to flow out to Binance.com users and that's happening with KAVA and BNB to name a few.""

42432549,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNaL1h,1597925941,It's Now Cheaper to Buy One Bitcoin Than to Buy a Single DeFi Token YFI,"CORRECTION (Aug. 20, 13:18 UTC): Adds context at the top of the story to make it clear it's the price of a single YFI that's more expensive than a single BTC and that the overall market value of bitcoin continues to be vastly greater. Also notes other tokens are priced above bitcoin, but YFI is the only one with notable trading volume.      Though the total market value of yEarn.finance's governance token (YFI) is still little more than a rounding error compared with sector behemoth bitcoin's (BTC), the explosive growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) along with the recent fallback in BTC have propelled the price of a single YFI past that of its much bigger crypto sibling.    yEarn.finance's governance token (YFI) has surged 35% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at nearly $13,500, according to CoinGecko data.  In comparison, after hitting a yearly-high earlier this week, bitcoin has now fallen back down to just under $11,800 – possibly in response to a strengthening dollar.  Bitcoin's exchange rate is also superseded by other obscure tokens, according to comprehensive pricing data from CoinGecko, but YFI represents the only token priced above BTC with any sort of notable 24-hour trading volume with roughly $107 million at last check.  YFI only launched four weeks ago – initially trading at just $32; it surged $400 as CoinDesk went to press.  Investors deposit select digital assets into YFI, which then automatically executes various DeFi trading strategies with ROIs of up to 95% – the platform takes 5% of the yield as commission.  Total value locked (TVL) in yEarn stood at $9.3 million on July 18 but boomed to $600 million by Tuesday. At press time, TVL stood at $675 million, according to DeFi Pulse.  As a governance token, YFI can be staked to give holders a vote on the protocol's direction. It can also be farmed like many other DeFi tokens.  But only 30,000 YFIs were created, meaning that despite the price surge its market cap currently sits at just under $400 million – a fraction of BTC's $218 billion.

Announced Thursday, the latest round, a Series C, was led by Anthony Pompliano’s Morgan Creek Digital. (It’s the second-largest round to be led by the VC firm, with Figure’s $103 million Series C topping the list.)      At the moment, BlockFi has $1.5 billion in crypto assets on its lending platform and is producing a little less than $10 million a month in revenue, CEO Zac Prince said in an interview. He said BlockFi is still trying to add personnel and keep equity capital stable in order to quickly expand geographically.      Prince also expects to have the first bitcoin rewards cards in the market by year’s end and a more public rollout early next year.      “You have to work with quite a few partners to bring a credit card to market,” Prince said. “Some of them haven’t really handled the transition from being fully in-office to being fully remote as smoothly as companies like BlockFi have.”    New investors    Other participants in the Series C include Peter Thiel’s Valar Ventures – the lead investor in BlockFi’s A and B rounds – CMT Digital, Castle Island Ventures, Winklevoss Capital, SCB 10X, Avon Ventures, Purple Arch Ventures, Kenetic Capital, HashKey, Michael Antonov, National Basketball Association player Matthew Dellavedova and two unnamed university endowments.      Read more: Bitcoin Lender BlockFi Raises $30M in Series B Led by Peter Thiel’s Valar Ventures      Dellavedova, who is a guard for the Cleveland Cavaliers, first learned about crypto in 2017 and was introduced to BlockFi by Morgan Creek’s Pompliano later on, he said in an interview.      Dellavedova has been making angel investments for the past three to four years, but BlockFi is the basketball player’s first crypto play, aside from holding “a little” bitcoin and ether, he said.      “I would say I’m still a rookie in this space,” he said. “I think having an interest rate that you can have on your crypto is appealing.”      Repeat investor Sterling Witzke, a partner at Winklevoss Capital, said BlockFi's ability to ""resonate with both retail and institutional customers"" has been a key selling point. ""We look forward to supporting the BlockFi team as they launch their next iteration of products and continue to drive mainstream adoption, firmly cementing crypto at the core of the future of finance,"" she said in a statement.    Profits during a crisis    Prince said BlockFi was able to continue its lending operation even after the March bitcoin crash while other lending firms took a short break.      Similar to Genesis and Celsius, BlockFi says March ended up being a good month for crypto lending because of the sector’s primary borrowers – proprietary traders and market makers.      “The event in March, we didn’t like it because there were clients of ours who have borrowed dollars secured by their cryptocurrency holdings, where we had to issue margin calls,” Prince said. “The way that we handled that I believe was more fair and flexible than the way those things are handled on platforms where everything is very black and white.”      Read more: $100M+ in Margin Calls: Crypto Lenders Demand Collateral as Market Buckles      While interest rates on fiat-backed crypto loans have trended downward after March, demand for bitcoin-backed dollar loans remains high, he added.      “If you look at the futures curve today, it’s implying north of 15% cost of borrowing cash, which makes sense given the bullish position in the market,” Prince said.    What’s next    BlockFi’s largest expense is people, Prince said, as the team has grown from just under 100 at the beginning of the year to 175 now, with engineering and security making up half of the staff.      Another major growth area is BlockFi’s risk-management team, including hires related to security infrastructure, compliance and financial risk, Prince said. The lender also has new sales and client-relationship teams in London and Singapore and one employee in Hong Kong.      Part of the Series C will go toward building a larger balance sheet so BlockFi can remain a less risky institution in the eyes of its counterparties. As a general rule, the firm is aiming to have a loan leverage ratio that is more conservative than what you would find at a traditional bank, which typically holds a minimum 5% leverage ratio.      Read more: Crypto Lender BlockFi Rolls Out Zero-Fee Trading for Bitcoin, Ether, GUSD      Nothing has changed about BlockFi’s collateral levels or its rehypothecation of loan collateral, Prince added. The CEO claims the firm’s loan and security agreement is more transparent than what customers would find at a securities lender in the traditional markets, where rehypothecation of loan collateral is also common.      “It’s a scary word,” Prince said about rehypothecation. “It’s the folks who are cut from a similar cloth as the ‘not your keys, not your crypto’ crowd.”      Prince would not say whether BlockFi invests customer assets into perpetual swaps, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust shares or other investment vehicles.      “We think about those and would consider them if it’s appropriate within the context of our risk-management function,” Prince said without going into detail.      Prince also admitted that BlockFi does uncollateralized lending to counterparties with “certain financial requirements” but would not say what percentage of the lender’s loan book was comprised of unsecured loans.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | ZRX,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/08/20/blockfi-raises-50m-from-universities-nba-star-others-as-crypto-lending-soars,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

CoinGecko data shows the price of ALGO tokens has increased from $0.53 to nearly $0.65, a jump of approximately 20% in the past 24 hours.  That translates into an $80 million increase in ALGO's market cap to $515 million.  ALGO peaked at over $0.70 last Friday, the highest it's been in over a year. The token has a way to go before it approaches its all-time high of $3.56, reached in June 2019.  This comes after Algorand's founder, Silvio Micali, unveiled a new set of smart contract capabilities that lowered transaction fees and ultimately make Algorand a faster and more efficient venue for DeFi-related activities – such as yield farming.  The digital asset industry has become completely enthralled by the sudden rise in the DeFi space over the past year – some projects have been able to attract hundreds of millions of dollars in investment in as little as 12 hours.  The total value locked in DeFi applications went past the $6 billion milestone at the week beginning, according to DeFi Pulse.

CoinGecko data shows OMG tokens have increased 115% from $1.70 to $3.65 in the past seven days – with the price surging by 30% in the past 24 hours.  The rally means OMG's market cap has surged by approximately $275 million since this time last week.  OMG's price has increased by nearly 1,000% since it fell to its all-time low of $0.35 after the Black Thursday crash in March.  Denis Vinokourov, research head at crypto exchange BeQuant, told CoinDesk OMG Network was benefitting from a ""perfect storm"" of industry-wide developments.  The craze around DeFi – a subset that has exploded to well over $6 billion – has seen a surge in activity on Ethereum, leading to soaring fees.  There are also reports the testnet for Eth 2.0 – a new iteration that would make the blockchain platform much more scalable – crashed last week.  As such, investors are beginning to look more closely at layer 2 solutions, he said.  Ethereum's average transaction fees rapidly shot up from under $0.10 in January to nearly $3.40 currently – the first time fees have stayed so consistently high.  Stablecoin Tether – a notable ""gas guzzler"" – said Wednesday it was launching on OMG Network so it could take some of the pressure off the base layer.
