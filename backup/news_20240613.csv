Lido And Mellow Finance’s Partnership Despite the challenging market conditions, Lido has made notable strides within its ecosystem. Collaborating with Mellow Finance as part of the Lido Alliance, the protocol has introduced advanced decentralized finance (DeFi) strategies for stETH holders. These strategies aim to leverage Mellow Finance’s permissionless Liquid Restaking Token (LRT) creation, enabling stETH holders to maximize asset utility through decentralized restaking and accumulating various rewards. Related Reading: Solana On-Chain Indicators Suggests A Return Of Bullish Sentiment, Is It Time To Buy SOL? The newly launched vaults also aim to secure and flexible means for engaging with Ethereum staking and DeFi, increasing the liquidity and utility of stETH. This partnership marks the initial phase of the Lido Alliance’s efforts to expand the Ethereum staking ecosystem through strategic collaborations with aligned projects. However, key metrics indicate a decline in the price of LDO, potentially following the footsteps of Ethereum, which has also seen a drop to $3,480 from its March peak of $3,990. Negative Financial Metrics Lido’s Total Value Locked (TVL) experienced a 1.70% decrease, amounting to $35.39 billion, primarily influenced by ETH’s price decline. The amount of ETH staked witnessed a mild increase of 0.26%, with a net increase of 19,392 ETH staked over the past week. Similarly, the quantity of (w)stETH in lending pools saw a moderate increase of 1.46%, reaching 2.66 million stETH, while the amount of w(stETH) in liquidity pools decreased by 3.13% to 89.3k stETH. Moreover, the 7-day trading volume for (w)stETH stood at $1.03 billion, down by 19.7% compared to the previous week. Additionally, the total amount of wstETH bridged to Layer 2 solutions decreased by 2.86% to 136,893 wstETH. Analyzing the bridging statistics, the distribution of wstETH among various Layer 2 networks is as follows: Arbitrum: 69,676 wstETH (-6.07%) Optimism: 28,906 wstETH (+0.44%) Base: 15,429 wstETH (-6.35%) Scroll: 10,329 wstETH (+9.48%) Polygon: 8,522 wstETH (+0.07%) Linea: 2,928 wstETH (+20.59%) zkSync: 1,093 wstETH (-0.49%) LDO Price Targets Ranging From $6 To $17 Despite these metrics, crypto analyst Alex Clay remains optimistic about LDO’s future. Clay recently shared bullish predictions for LDO, envisioning significant breakouts if the bullish momentum resumes. In a recent post on social media site X, Clay emphasized LDO’s 756 days of ascending accumulation, suggesting a potentially “massive breakout.” The analyst further outlined exciting price targets for bullish investors, ranging from $6.3 to $17.2. Related Reading: Dogecoin Under Pressure And ‘Going To Zero’, Analyst Says – Here’s Why LDO is trading at $1.88, representing a 3.5% decrease within the 24-hour timeframe and a decline of over 20% in the past two weeks. Notably, the token has witnessed a 74% decrease from its all-time high of $7.30 in June 2021. It remains to be seen whether positive developments within the Lido protocol and increased staking activity can help mitigate the losses. Additionally, Ethereum’s potential price recovery may impact LDO’s trajectory, potentially leading to a new uptrend aimed at reclaiming previously lost levels.

42417900,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTbzwr,1718319540,Former Goldman Sachs Exec Joins Anchorage Digital Bank’s Board of Directors,"Crypto custody firm Anchorage Digital Bank has added Connie Shoemaker, a former Goldman Sachs executive, to its board of directors.  Shoemaker currently serves as the COO and CFO of Bridgewater Associates Holdings, the parent company of Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund.  Anchorage Digital Bank is the only crypto bank currently chartered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Other institutions, including Paxos and Protego, have attempted to receive a full charter from the OCC but have failed to move past the provisional charter hurdle. With the boom of institutional interest in crypto spurred by the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Anchorage Digital’s business is growing, a company spokesperson said.  In a Thursday announcement, Anchorage Digital Bank said the expansion of its board of directors was part of an effort to “meet rising institutional demand for safe, secure and federally regulated digital asset infrastructure.”  Anchorage Digital’s co-founder and CEO Nathan McCauley told CoinDesk through a company spokesperson that Shoemaker’s track record in the trad-fi world will be “invaluable” as the company continues to grow, adding that her experience building the commercial bank division at Goldman Sachs is “highly applicable” to Anchorage Digital’s work.  “By adding Connie to the board of Anchorage Digital Bank, we are doubling down on our commitment to advance the institutional ecosystem with our federally regulated offering,” McCauley said.  Shoemaker was Goldman Sachs’ global head of strategy during the 2008 global financial crisis, during which she oversaw the growth of Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM). She was later Chief Administrative Officer of Goldman Sachs Bank USA.

Blockchain analysis platform Arkham reported that Egorov faced liquidations totaling $140 million in CRV. Curve Finance Founder Egorov Liquidated In a social media post on X (formerly Twitter), Arkham confirmed that Egorov’s lending position worth nine figures was liquidated across five protocols due to the price of CRV dropping below his liquidation threshold. Related Reading: Solana On-Chain Indicators Suggests A Return Of Bullish Sentiment, Is It Time To Buy SOL? Egorov’s accounts incurred over a million dollars of bad debt on Curve’s Llamalend, which he managed to clear by receiving $6 million USDT. Additionally, Egorov experienced a $5 million liquidation on UwU Lend while making repayments on Inverse to mitigate further losses. On June 13, Curve contributor Saint Rat revealed that the protocol had incurred $11.5 million in bad debt, which could be resolved if the price of CRV rises to $0.33. Egorov expressed his commitment to working with the Curve Finance team to address the bad debt situation and protect users from its impact. Proposal To Burn 10% Of CRV Tokens In response to the crisis, Egorov proposed burning 10% of the total CRV supply to stabilize the token’s price. He also announced that active voters would receive a three-month boost on deposit rewards across all Curve platforms, aiming to incentivize participation and strengthen the ecosystem. Egorov also stated: The Curve Finance team and I have been working to solve the liquidation risk issue which happened today. Many of you are aware that I had all my loans liquidated. Size of my positions was too large for markets to handle and caused 10M of bad debt. Only CRV market on lend.curve.fi (where the position was the biggest) was affected. I have already repaid 93%, and I intend to repay the rest very shortly. It will help users not to suffer from this situation. Related Reading: Toncoin (TON) Set For 40% Breakout: Buy At This Price, Says Crypto Analyst Interestingly, this recent episode is not the first time Egorov has faced significant liquidations. Last year, he borrowed $60 million worth of loans from Aave, which posed a risk of bad debt in the event of liquidation. To address this, Gauntlet, a risk management firm, recommended freezing Aave’s v2 CRV market to minimize protocol risks. In a subsequent private deal, Egorov sold 106 million CRV for $46 million to repay most of his debts on Aave and other lending platforms, ultimately settling his debt to Aave with an $11 million USDT deposit in September. Before the market crash, CRV was trading at $0.3582. However, it plummeted nearly 40%, hitting an all-time low of $0.2220. Since then, the token has recovered and is currently trading at $0.2880. This recovery has helped to mitigate the losses incurred within the 24-hour timeframe, reducing them to 22%.

The settlement involves a $4.5 billion penalty and a ban on trading ""crypto asset securities.""  A U.S. District Court judge has agreed to a settlement between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Terraform Labs and its former CEO, Do Kwon, which would have them pay billions in penalties as well as virtually ban them from the crypto industry, according to the court filings.  The settlement approved by District Court Judge Jed Rakoff of the Southern District of New York (SDNY) involves Terraform Labs and Kwon paying a combined $4.5 billion in disgorgement and civil penalties while being permanently banned from buying and selling all ""crypto asset securities,"" including Terra ecosystem tokens.  The settlement comes just two months after a New York jury found Terraform Labs and Kwon civilly liable for fraud stemming from the $40 billion collapse of the Terra ecosystem in May 2022. Terra's implosion led to the collapse of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital which, in turn, took out other crypto companies including Genesis Global Capital and, indirectly, FTX.  “This case affirms what court after court has said: The economic realities of a product — not the labels, the spin, or the hype — determine whether it is a security under the securities laws,” said SEC Chair Gary Gensler in a Thursday press release. “Terraform and Do Kwon’s fraudulent activities caused devastating losses for investors, in some cases wiping out entire life savings. Their fraud serves as a reminder that, when firms fail to comply with the law, investors get hurt. Terraform and Kwon fought our efforts to investigate – taking a fight over investigative subpoenas all the way to the Supreme Court. Thankfully, with this settlement, the victims of their massive fraud will now get some justice.”  The SEC first suggested a $5.3 billion settlement in the case, which lawyers for Terraform Labs countered by telling the judge that the company should be fined no more than $1 million in civil penalties. On June 6, lawyers for both Kwon and Terraform Labs agreed to the SEC's second settlement offer of $4.5 billion.  Kwon, still in custody in Montenegro awaiting a decision on his extradition, did not appear at the trial where the settlement was reached.  Terraform Labs is currently in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and, according to current CEO Chris Amani's trial testimony, has approximately $150 million in assets on hand. It is currently unclear how the company will pay the hefty fines.  The settlement is binding and cannot be appealed.

Bullish sentiment also continues to prevail, with the market still being fairly greedy amid expectations that the pioneer cryptocurrency is gearing up for a significant price jump from here. Bitcoin Can Still Make A 35% Jump Crypto analyst CryptoCon has revealed that Bitcoin still has a ways to go before the cycle top is in. In the analysis posted on X (formerly Twitter), the crypto analyst revealed that the digital asset is yet to reach Level 3 of the Magic Bands, so the top is not in yet. Related Reading: Historical Trends Suggest Shiba Inu Price Will Rally 1,000% To $0.00024, Analyst Reveals When The analyst points to previous bull cycles where the Magic Bands had been fully completed before the top was finally in. For the whole band to be completed, there are four levels in total. However, the current cycle is still only in the 2.5 level, which means there is still a ways to go. The next major level from here is the Level 3 Magic Band, which usually comes with a surge in price. Following the completion of the Level 2 that saw the price reach a new all-time high above $72,300, the cryptocurrency is now testing the resistance at the Level 2.5, where a break is needed. If the Bitcoin price is able to break this resistance, the crypto analyst sees a 35% surge to $91,500 sometime in 2024. “Taking some time to reach it at Level 3 of the Magic bands, but it’s the next step,” the crypto analyst stated. $91,539 target left untouched and unchanged for #Bitcoin. Taking some time to reach it at Level 3 of the Magic bands but it’s the next step. All in due time… pic.twitter.com/Pwimj05ZQb — CryptoCon (@CryptoCon_) June 12, 2024 When Will The BTC Price Top? Using CryptoCon’s Magic Bands analysis, it is possible that the Bitcoin cycle top is still far away. As the crypto analyst shows, even after hitting the Level 3 magic band, there is still Level 4 left to go, which is what usually marks the cycle top. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Cardano Price Will Rally 370% To $2, Here’s The Timeline This means after hitting $91,500 at the top of Level 3, there could be consolidation before the Level 4 Magic Band is completed. When this happens, the crypto analyst expects the BTC price to actually touch above $123,000 before the cycle top is in. If CryptoCon’s analyst is anything to go buy, then Bitcoin still has another 100% move from from its current price before the bull market is over. The cycle top is expected to hit sometime around 2026, according to the analyst. Presently, the BTC price is still being held up by bulls who have continued to endure an onslaught from sellers.

29435884,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=624486,1718308859,"Bitcoin Stuck: Here Are 2 Things That Must Happen For BTC To Break $72,000","At spot rates, Bitcoin is firm, but traders doubt the uptrend following the unexpected dump on June 11. Currently, Bitcoin is stable, trending above $67,000 and down despite gains on June 12. Still, even at this level, there are concerns because the coin, despite all the confidence across the board, remains below $72,000. This reaction line is emerging as a key liquidation area. If broken, BTC could unleash a wave of short liquidation, accelerating the lift-off to $74,000 and beyond. Will Bitcoin Demand Soar In Spot Markets? Taking to X, one on-chain analyst said that Bitcoin is stagnating at spot levels below $72,000 because hedge funds are short on futures. Related Reading: Solana On-Chain Indicators Suggests A Return Of Bullish Sentiment, Is It Time To Buy SOL? Though this has been a known development for a while, hedge funds have stacked their BTC shorts via the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) by over $1 billion in the last week alone. Therefore, the analyst says two things must happen to reverse this effect and support prices. Although the BTC shorting on CME is not necessarily a bearish signal, hedge funds are hedging by playing a sophisticated arbitrate strategy, and coin holders must look at fundamentals. Hedge funds are simultaneously shorting BTC futures on CME and buying on the spot market. Therefore, for the coin to break $72,000 and pierce $74,000, the analyst said users must buy at least 2X the amount of BTC futures shorted in the spot market. BTC Prices Must Fall For Short Sellers To Exit If there is no incentive to lift spot prices higher, then Bitcoin prices must fall. Falling prices will encourage short sellers, in this case, the hedge funds, to exit their positions lest they continue paying funding rates. In a bearish market, and when futures prices begin to fall, short sellers must pay longs for the index not to deviate. Whether there will be a spike in demand in the spot market remains to be seen. However, what’s evident is that institutional interest in Bitcoin is there, only that hedge funds, as seen from their arbitrage trade using CME, want to profit, regardless of price movements. Related Reading: Dogecoin Under Pressure And ‘Going To Zero’, Analyst Says – Here’s Why The analyst also shared another chart to solidify the bullish outlook. The trader used the “Growth Rate” metric to compare changes in Bitcoin’s market and realized cap.

The token, promoted by the controversial figure Andrew Tate, has gained traction, surpassing Iggy Azalea’s MOTHER. However, Tate is now accused of some concerning activity for crypto investors. Related Reading: Dogwifhat To Tumble? Analyst Sets $1 Target For WIF Andrew Tate Endorses DADDY On June 11, former pro kickboxer and controversial online figure Andrew Tate started promoting a new memecoin. The DADDY token was marketed as the direct competition to Iggy Azalea’s MOTHER, the most successful celebrity launch. Before he endorsed DADDY, Tate stated he held zero tokens but was aware there were hundreds of memecoins related to his likeness. Days later, he invited popular crypto trader Ansem to fight him in a boxing match, claiming this was “his cycle.” He also suggested that the loser donates $10 million to a token of the winner’s choosing. Tate’s approach received mixed reactions from the members of the crypto community. Content creator Jakey jokingly claimed that Crypto Twitter was the new YouTube. Another user stated, “Every day we get further away from god.” On Tuesday, Tate promoted the Daddy Tate memecoin, which was also received with mixed feelings and some criticism. The promotional posts targeted Azalea’s MOTHER while making sexist “jokes” and using domestic violence as a punchline. I heard about a coin called mother so now I’m supporting a coin called $DADDY to flip it for the patriarchy. We’re bringing the Gs back make me a fucking sandwich females. Tate’s Memecoin Called Out For Insider Trading On Wednesday, crypto analytics firm Bubblemaps accused the token of having “huge insider activity.” According to the firm, they found suspicious activity before Tate started promoting DADDY. Bubblemaps revealed that insiders allegedly bought 30% of the token’s supply at launch. On June 9, Daddy Tate’s team sent 40% of the total supply to the former kickboxer, which he promised not to sell. Additionally, he bought $10,000 worth of DADDY and burned it. Despite this, the token seems to “have a catch.” Per the report, 11 wallets are holding 20% of the supply. These wallets were founded through Binance with “nearly identical amounts at the same time.” Moreover, they bought the tokens, worth around $30 million, on June 9, before the team started to promote the token on X. The firm claims that the timing and amounts “strongly suggest” the wallets belong to the same group. Similarly, two other clusters hold an additional 10% of the supply and seem to be linked through a third wallet. Bubblemaps urged investors to remain cautious as the insiders “seem to be active on $DADDY and are trying to cover their tracks.” The firm warned that “one of these wallets could nuke the liquidity pool.” DADDY Surpasses MOTHER After Tate’s post about DADDY, the crypto community called him out for his posts. Some users suggested he returned when the token was a MOTHER’s level. At the time, Daddy Tate had a $45 million market capitalization and was trading at $0.1499. Nonetheless, DADDY gained traction on Wednesday, surging to $0.36. In 24 hours, the token increased by 143% to a new all-time high (ATH) and reached a $280 million market capitalization. This performance saw the memecoin surpass MOTHER despite the controversial promotion and insider activity allegations. Since then, the token has retraced to the $0.24 price level, a 32% decline in the last 12 hours. DADDY had a market cap of $240 million at the time of writing. Meanwhile, MOTHER saw a 46% surge on Wednesday, which propelled the price from $0.15 to $0.22. In the following hours, the memecoin’s price declined 36% to the $0.14 range before recovering.

This lackluster price action has left many XRP investors feeling wanting, especially considering the positive price action of other cryptocurrencies. Sean McBride, a former director at Ripple, believes XRP is unlikely to register a significant breakout until Ripple’s ongoing lawsuit with the SEC concludes. Ongoing SEC Lawsuit Weighs Heavily On XRP Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC has been dragging on for over three years, and it continues to cast a dark cloud over XRP’s price. Ripple scored a partial win in July 2023 when Judge Torres decided that XRP to retail investors is not a security. This decision resulted in a temporary increase in the price of XRP to $0.90. However, the embattled crypto token now finds itself stuck below $0.50, unable to break out despite various rebounds and periods of dominance by the bulls. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Cardano Price Will Rally 370% To $2, Here’s The Timeline A recent example of this repetition was observed in the past 30 days when a period of bull dominance saw XRP trading just above the $0.5 price mark for three weeks. However, like before, XRP’s price has failed to maintain its position above this level, and the crypto now finds itself trading around $0.48. As McBride noted on social media, nothing significant will happen to XRP’s price until Judge Torres makes her decision. This is in relation to the pending decision on whether the sale of XRP to institutional investors qualifies as the sale of securities. According to the former Ripple director, a clear judgment from the judge would finally enable institutional investors to decide their stance on Ripple and XRP. “Nothing significant is going to happen with the price of XRP until Judge Torres makes her decision,” McBride said. “This could open up the door for US institutions working with Ripple to ‘flip the switch’,” he continued. I think I’ve mentioned this before. Nothing significant is going to happen with the price of XRP until Judge Torres makes her decision. So anyone expecting anything different is delusional. The next big piece of this is clear legislation in the US. Hopefully that is on the way… — Sean McBride (@seanmcbride16) June 11, 2024 What Will It Take For XRP Price To Break Out of Its Slump? Before XRP can truly break out of its slump, the lawsuit with the SEC must be resolved. As long as the case drags on, uncertainty will hang over the token and suppress the price. A settlement or victory for Ripple would remove this roadblock and likely send the price of XRP surging. Of course, XRP would need to outperform the market to compensate for lost ground over the past three years. However, a loss could deal a major blow to XRP and cause the price to plummet further.

29430050,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=624401,1718298052,"Solana Set For “A Major 53% Price Move,” Analyst Reveals Why","An analyst has explained how Solana could be setting up for a major 53% move based on a Symmetrical Triangle pattern forming in its price chart. Solana Has Been Travelling Inside A Symmetrical Triangle Recently In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez discussed a pattern that has recently taken shape in Solana’s daily price chart. The technical analysis (TA) pattern in question is a “Symmetrical Triangle,” which, as its name implies, looks like a triangle. The triangular shape comprises two converging trendlines, with the upper line joining successive lower highs and the lower one connecting higher lows. A key feature of this pattern is that these lines approach each other at roughly the same slope (hence the “symmetrical” in the title). Related Reading: Why Is Bitcoin Stagnant Despite ETF Inflows? Report Answers Like other TA patterns, when the asset price consolidates in the region bounded by these trendlines, resistance will probably be at the upper level and support at the lower one. A break out of either of these lines can suggest a continuation of the trend in that direction. Naturally, a break above the triangle could be a bullish signal, while a decline under the pattern could lead to a bearish outcome. Similar to the Symmetrical Triangle, there are other triangle patterns in TA. A couple of popular ones include the Ascending and Descending Triangles. These patterns differ from the Symmetrical Triangle in that one of their trendlines is parallel to the time axis. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the Symmetrical Triangle that the 1-day price of Solana has been trading inside over the last few months: As the above graph shows, Solana has been closing in at the tip of this Symmetrical Triangle pattern recently. As consolidation becomes tighter, a break out of the pattern naturally becomes more probable. As mentioned earlier, which of the two lines the breakout happens from sets the direction the potential price move would go. “Keep an eye on the $143 support and $178 resistance levels to gauge the direction of the SOL trend,” notes Ali. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Overheated Right Now? This Metric Suggests No From the chart, it’s apparent that Solana is currently floating near the bottom line, so a retest could be coming up soon. If bullish momentum has to return for the coin, this retest must be successful. Moves resulting from a breakout of a Symmetrical Triangle may be the same length as the triangle’s height. In the case of this Solana Symmetrical Triangle, the height represents a price swing of 53%, so Ali believes that a breakout would also set the coin up for a move of a similar scale. SOL Price Solana hasn’t had the best times during the last few weeks, as its price is now down to $149. It remains to be seen whether a potential upcoming retest of the Symmetrical Triangle support would change the coin’s fate.

Market Timing Is Never Easy,"Summary CleanSpark delivered over 600% share price growth in 4 months, they have to be worth a look. CleanSpark has outperformed Bitcoin and other miners, but questions remain about the sustainability of their performance and market timing strategies. CleanSpark's focus on efficiency, market timing, and aggressive expansion through acquisitions present both bullish and bearish risks for investors. During 2023, I was a big buyer of Bitfarms (BITF). I chose them after analyzing several miners (writing about Hut 8 Corp (HUT), , Hive Digital Technologies ( HIVE ), Cipher Mining ( CIFR ) and Bitfarms ( BITF ) ). BITF turned out to be a great choice, returning over 100% on two occasions and 25% on the third. Things are changing, and I have decided I need a new miner to replace Bitfarms in my portfolio. The CEO and driving force behind everything I liked about Bitfarms has left in acrimonious circumstances , and they are being circled by acquisition orientated companies. I began a search for a new miner restricted to those with a market cap over $1 billion. The industry is maturing, and the halving has reduced the rewards miners get for their operations, making the industry even more competitive than it was. In this new reality, I think size is going to matter, I expect a lot of smaller miners to have trouble surviving the halving, and any without the most efficient operations may be squeezed into an unprofitable scenario. Economies of scale will be important, likely only the biggest will survive, and the interest in Bitfarms as an acquisition target may be the first soundings of an industry consolidation. This means I am looking at 7 miners, and the first thing I did was look at their stock price performance against the price of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). Price Charts (Author Database) On this graph, which plots the change in price over the last 360 days (so 12 months ago was day 0), CleanSpark is the standout performer. As a result, it is the first miner I will look at. CleanSpark has been a better investment than Bitcoin In an industry that has thrived on hype and experienced many high-flying companies come crashing down to earth, we have to ask if the CleanSpark outperformance of Bitcoin is justified? It is in marked contrast to the other miners who have struggled to deliver the investment returns of Bitcoin. The price performance of CleanSpark shares is pretty astonishing, the share price moved from $3.50 in December 2023 to over $24.50 by the end of March 2024. That's an astonishing 600% in 4 months, since March, the price has fallen to around $14.50 today, still it is up massively from December. Such a move does suggest hype rather than substance. Can Miners outperform Bitcoin? I believe that all miners, if sufficiently efficient, should be a better investment than BTC and the BTC ETFs. An ETF gives you exposure to bitcoin at the spot price, you could also buy from a crypto exchange at something very close to this spot price. A miner, on the other hand, generates its bitcoins at a significant discount to spot sometimes more than 50% discount, when you buy a miner you are buying exposure to their holding of bitcoins being acquired at a substantial discount to spot prices. Of course, the market is never completely rational about these things, and it is always supply and demand that drives prices, not any belief in a fair value. CleanSpark Efficiency Rating Getting a fair value for Bitcoin miners is difficult, and there is no accepted view. You cannot use discounted cash flow as they are not aiming to generate cash, we need some sort of discounted bit flow, but no such measure exists. Nonetheless, I will try to analyze CleanSpark relative to the competition. CleanSpark could be more efficient than the competition, simply better at doing what it does, this would account for the price premium. A new strategy or a more fundamental reason could explain the outperformance of both the Bitcoin mining sector and Bitcoin itself. If I cannot find a solid fundamental reason for the outperformance, then the most likely scenario is for its price to revert back towards the mean performance of Bitcoin miners in the way Marathon Digital ( MARA ) did on the chart. Mean reversion is a well-known phenomenon in trading, and many people use it as a trading strategy. When I last wrote about Bitfarms, I included this graphic that attempts to measure the efficiency of the miners I follow. It relates to Bitcoins mined in Q1 2024 and the previous five years' capital expenditure plus operating expenses in the last quarter. CleanSpark stands out, having the highest score for BTC per million of operating expenses. They and the other miners suffer on some of the measures related to market cap versus the smaller miners. It does point to the efficient use of capital and resources; however, it is a flawed measure in isolation. CLSK only mines bitcoin, so every cent of operating expenses goes toward bitcoins. Other companies run data centers and have moved into AI so much of their operating expenses are being spent elsewhere. Mining Efficiency (Author) A second view of efficiency comes from Compass Mining , it is a monthly report written by Anthony Power and is well worth reading, I read it every month. Bitcoins mined 2024 (Compass Mining) It shows CleanSpark mid-table for 2024 and the gap between it and the top-rated Bitfarms has increased from 1.1 bitcoin per exahash in March to 2.4 in April. I compare CleanSpark with Bitfarms as they are the other miner focussed on solely being a vertically integrated self-miner. The others typically have a range of activities, so the comparisons are not as clear. It means CleanSpark is not getting the same amount of Bitcoins from their fleet of miners as other companies, suggesting they are not that efficient. CleanSpark History CleanSpark began life as a renewable energy company, converting waste into gas. They merged with a microgrid company and then decided to build their own data centers and mine Bitcoin rather than sell microgrids to data centers. Now CleanSpark is a vertically integrated Bitcoin miner. I like this strategy, it is one of the main reasons I bought into Bitfarms. CleanSpark are not trying to move into AI, they are not hosting data centers for others; they are buying miners, building data centers, developing the infrastructure to maintain their fleet, and mining Bitcoins. I like the focused strategy. CleanSpark are market timers CleanSpark strongly believes in its ability to strategically manage their business better than other bitcoin miners. This comes across in almost all of their public interviews; in a special call last month with the bank H.C. Wainwright (who have CLSK as their top pick for 2024) they repeatedly stressed their belief in their strategic advantage. They said their business was driven by ""strategy over ideology"". The crypto industry is full of ideologies, with many people having strong views about how the industry should behave and what bitcoin means to the world. The idea of using business strategy to maximise profits and not concentrate on the ideology of the industry is one I find appealing. In the Q2 2024 earnings call, the CEO said ""Our strategic approach sets us apart in an industry"" Although I admire their confidence, it comes with consequences, it has turned them into market timers. The CEO said at the Wainwright talk. an example of this is we sold Bitcoin at the peak of the market last year because everybody else thought you should hold it, and I looked at the market and said everyone's lost their minds. The problem with timing the market, as everyone reading this will know, most people get it wrong most of the time. I am no exception to this rule, I have bought at the top and sold at the bottom more times than I care to remember and, as a rule, I have learned to be sceptical of people who tell me they know how to time markets. When I looked at the data, the same is true of the managers at CleanSpark, they sold their bitcoin hodle last year at the low point and stopped selling when the price began to recover. CLSK selling (Author database) The blue bars are the number of Bitcoins CleanSpark sold each month in 2023, and the orange line is the average price they received per bitcoin. As you can see, they stopped selling just as the price began to move higher. In October they managed to capture the final low point in BTC when they sold 562 bitcoins for $28,600 each. Today, those bitcoins are worth $65,000 and their attempt at market timing cost the company more than $20 million. CleanSpark and Electricity Prices Bitcoin mining is all about managing energy. All the miners have access to the same mining rigs, the same switching gear and transformers. The key to profitability is in the cost of electricity to power the rigs. CleanSparks history as an energy company has them believing that they understand the electricity market better than their competitors and that they can time the market giving them a price advantage. From the Wainwright call using all of the kind of advantages that came out of several years of renewable energy generation and development modeling solutions around cost avoidance or time-of-use charges….provides us some insight that I think maybe is unique in the Bitcoin mining space CleanSpark has deviated from the more common path of signing fixed-rate electricity deals. They are market timers and prefer to have a floating rate energy cost. They turn off the machines when prices are high and run them full speed when prices are low. It is not the rebate kind of deal where they get paid to throttle back they just pay for what they use. In the Wainwright call they discussed the floating rate power deal. They said Now we don't turn our facilities off often. But for example, avoiding 100 to 200 hours a year, which is just a fraction of the time we can have up to 30% less power prices. The CEO discussed the Mississippi takeover, which is coming with a fixed-rate electricity deal, and said they will look to move it to a floating rate saying ""this is what we do best"". His view is that the fixed rate deal is an energy hedge and his goal is to beat the hedge price. Later in the call he said "" power is consistently in the month of March was in the $0.01 plus range, right? If this is true, and they are getting electricity at $0.01 CleanSpark has been incredibly successful, when I wrote about Bitfarms the lowest electricity costs on fixed rate deals seemed to be around $0.042. Looking at the Q2 earnings, things were not quite as good as suggested. CleanSpark has a cohosted site in New York and in Q2 prices were high at $0.075 which lifted the average to $0.043, a good price but not spectacular. I have known many market timers in my career, and they tend to focus on the big wins and ignore the losses. It is not unreasonable to level this accusation at CLSK. In the Wainwright call they mentioned the $0.01 but did not mention the $0.075 A price of $0.01 is the big win but all of that effort in timing the market, turning machines off for a couple of hundred hours a year trying to beat the hedge when actually, on average, they didn't. The floating rate puts them at risk of any significant and prolonged surge in the price of energy, they are confident that they understand the market well enough to manage this situation but black swans are real and that is why the majority of the industry hedges its prices with a fixed rate deal, CleanSpark are taking on significantly extra risk and not showing any significant return for this extra risk. Distressed Asset Acquisition CLSK grows by acquisition, they have grown fast and intend to grow even faster. They are expecting a flurry of M&A (Q2 earnings call) activity post halving. They believe that miners struggling before the halving, who do not have the balance sheet or the cash to upgrade their mining fleet, will be looking to offload data centers and slim down operations. They did say in the Wainwright call they are not interested in mergers, only acquisitions. Cleanspark has no debt and the CEO said, ""we've gone through a couple of $0.5 billion ATM transactions"". When you add the $1 billion of dilution to the cash raised from selling bitcoins last year, you get a lot of cash on the balance sheet. CleanSpark intends to use the balance sheet to grow significantly. They have given guidance of 50 exahash in the next 12 months, a significant increase from todays 17. The 17 figure shows huge growth, almost trebling from the position 12 months ago. Recent expansion saw them moving into Mississippi, buying three facilities. They announced just before the Q2 earnings call they were buying two facilities in Wyoming. The CEO said in the earnings call ""We expect to be one of the most measured and active acquirers in the industry."" And discussed their aggressive purchasing of new mining machines; they have placed orders for Bitmains s21 Pro miners and guided to 20,000 arriving in April, May, and June in the Wainwright call. In the Q2 earnings call, the CEO stressed that he believes the halving will lead to distressed miners selling datacenters The opportunity for CleanSpark isn't just in the amount of hashrate that drops off, but in the data centers that become available as a result and expanded by saying the decrease in network hashrate of 15% since the halving means that data center space equal to five times the capacity of CleanSpark has become available. The plan is to buy data centers and swap out inefficient mining rigs with the new S21 rigs they have bought. CleanSpark has ordered an additional 100,000 rigs (In the earnings call they confirmed that this option had been exercised) that will take the total exahash over 50. That is a huge increase and will make them one of the biggest, perhaps the biggest, bitcoin miners. It will put them on par with Marathon, who are also targeting 50 exahash. At the moment, they do not have anywhere to put those 100,000 rigs, they are relying on timing this market correctly and negotiating acquisitions at the right price and in the right geographical place with the economics for profitable mining. It seems like a big gamble to me; looking at the 100,000 rigs means they need to acquire three times as much data center capacity as they currently have and are committed to doing this in H2 2024 and H1 2025. CleanSpark Finances With equity (assets – liabilities) greater than $1 billion and debt of under a million, CleanSpark is in excellent financial shape. It has just turned profitable but has not yet delivered positive cash flow. The profitability of miners cannot be thought of in the same way as profitability for most companies. The gain or loss on the value of bitcoins they have on the balance sheet makes an enormous difference to the profits they report. If you look at Q2 for 2023 and 2024 you can see this in action. Q2 2024 showed a gain of $119 million (all figures in '000s) whereas this line item was zero for 2023, these huge swings in the value of bitcoin will always make analyzing these companies difficult. Y-on-Y line items (Author Database) The balance sheet has a similar issue, Cleanspark shows current assets of $687 million, with $358 of that being the bitcoin held in treasury. We cannot ignore the bitcoin, but unlike all of the other short term assets, it is subject to huge swings in value. It could easily double in value before the next earnings release, making the profits look fantastic and the balance sheet robust or halve in value, giving the opposite view, but nothing about the business may have changed. Balance sheet Y-o-Y (Author Database) If we look at the cash (ignoring bitcoins) CleanSpark has a cash runway of just over 12 months, adjusting for the amount of bitcoins it rises to almost three years. Either way, it is a pretty solid balance sheet. CleanSpark management seems intent on investing heavily over the next 12 months, acquiring data centers and mining rigs, which may have a material impact on the balance sheet, if bitcoin prices rise it may not be such a problem. Dilution In the last 12 months investors have suffered more than 100% dilution, an enormous figure, but it does not seem to have dented appetite for the stock which has soared higher. Dilution is likely to continue, the acquisition plan may require more cash or be paid for in equity. We do not know how much will be spent. Still, they are attempting to treble the size of the business. Property and equipment on the balance sheet is $670 million, so trebling it could be in the order of $1.5 billion, which would require significant further dilution. The general public owns 52% of shares, institutions 45%, and insiders less than 3%. The high general public ownership makes volatility more likely, and I worry that the relatively low insider holdings does not align the interests of the management with the interests of the shareholders. The CEO, Zachary Bradford, received a total package of $7 million in 2023, which is about average for a company of this size, he sold shares for $9 million in March 2024, leaving him with around $50 million of shares left. Risks Bearish and Bullish Bitcoin Prices The price of Bitcoin could soar, massively increasing the value of the CLSK treasury, but with that comes problems. It will be challenging to find distressed miners if there is a very high bitcoin price, even inefficient miners would cover their costs. The expansion plan would be put into difficulty and the cost of housing the 100,000 new miners would rise. In this case, the current price premium of shares may fall in line with those of other companies. The price of Bitcoin could remain reasonably stable, which might imply that they can carry out their plan as they have laid it out. If miners are in distress now, a flat Bitcoin price will not help and their assets may be available at reduced prices. This would probably be the best scenario for CleanSpark as their efficient operational business model could be expanded at relatively low cost. A significant fall in Bitcoin prices would be difficult for the whole industry, I would expect to see CleanSpark try to take advantage of it and buy distressed assets at fire sale prices. If the Bitcoin price recovered, CleanSpark could emerge as a much bigger force, maybe even a world-leading miner. If the Bitcoin price does not recover, then CleanSpark will be in trouble. They would have increased operations and costs and possibly be unable to mine bitcoins at a profit. I doubt they could survive that situation for long. The second risk is Electricity Costs A prolonged surge in electricity prices would leave CleanSpark at a significant disadvantage to the rest of the industry on their fixed price deals. Other companies have also spread operations around the world whereas CleanSpark remains almost entirely US-based, it does come with regulatory risk and the risk of some issue affecting the US electricity grid, which forces prices up across the country. If electricity prices fall, then CLSK stands to gain relative to the rest of the industry, they have said they can get variable prices as low as $0.01 a quarter of the price most miners are paying. If that became a standard price, they would have an enormous competitive advantage. In a low electricity price environment, CleanSpark is well-placed to lead this market. Conclusion It could work out, the floating rate electricity deals could deliver a lower cost of energy to CleanSpark than the rest of the industry gets with fixed rate deals. They negotiated a fantastic price for the 100,000 Bitmain S21 pro machines and could secure new data centers at a similarly low price from distressed miners who have already dealt with the regulatory issues and utility connection problems surrounding greenfield site builds. On the other hand, the floating rate energy price may continue to deliver an average price in line with the rest of the market. They may face competition from the other big miners when they seek to acquire data centers. We know Riot Platforms is interested in acquisition as Riot made an offer for Bitfarms who said they had received other expressions of interest. CleanSark have said they believe that the ETFs will continue to power demand and have an insatiable appetite for Bitcoin. Unfortunately, that may not be true, as the ETFs have suffered substantial outflows of late . I am not going to buy CleanSpark, the risks seem great and the elevated share price relative to the rest of the industry suggests some mean reversion may be about to play out. CleanSpark management seems overconfident, and have exposed the company to a black swan event. In the crypto industry, the last thing I want to see is more risk. I will continue my search for a miner to replace my previous favorite BITF in my portfolio.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4699108-cleanspark-share-price-surge-hype-or-value?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/29428371.jpeg

42417898,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTbzsj,1718294867,Assured Spot Ether ETF Approval Fails to Stir Slumping Crypto Market,"Cryptocurrency markets remained under pressure during U.S. trading hours on Thursday, continuing a pullback that began a day earlier when the Fed signaled it only expected to cut rates once this year.  The price of ether {{ETH}} led a mid-morning bounce after U.S. Securities and Exchange Chairman Gary Gensler – in testimony at a Senate hearing – said he expected spot ether ETFs to have received full approvals from his agency by the end of the summer.  The news sent ether higher by 1% but it turned out to have been a selling opportunity, with the price reversing more than 3% just one hour later. At press time, ether was changing hands at $3,440, down 5% over the past 24 hours. The broader CoinDesk 20 Index was lower by 4.9% over the same period.  Also off by nearly 5% was the price of bitcoin {{BTC}}, which was trading near a one-week low of $66,300.  Markets began heading south on Wednesday afternoon after the Federal Reserve's hawkish policy meeting results. The U.S. central bank held its benchmark fed funds rate range steady at 5.25%-5.50% but surprised with its updated projections suggesting an expectation for just one 25 basis point rate cut in 2024. Rate futures markets, meanwhile, had been pricing in two to three 25 basis point moves this year.  Failing to improve the macro mood in crypto was U.S. economic data Thursday morning suggesting a continued softening in both the inflation and the economy. The May Producer Price Index (PPI) fell 0.2% against expectations for a rise of 0.1%. On a year-over-year basis, PPI was higher by 2.2% versus forecasts for 2.5%. There were also initial jobless claims which rose to nearly a one-year high of 242,000 versus expectations of 225,000.  ""$66K seems like equilibrium,"" said well-followed analyst Skew in an X post, who along with others is trying to decode a market that won't go sustainably higher despite a lot of recent bullish news: improving inflation data, a Bitcoin-friendly presidential frontrunner in Donald Trump, spot ETH ETF approvals, and other risk asset markets (namely U.S. stocks) ripping to new all-time highs.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Stephen Alpher, Krisztian Sandor",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/06/13/assured-spot-ether-etf-approval-fails-to-stir-slumping-crypto-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8225f2b6b3b2eef7c86fb1bbe437e58622e6c322-720x377.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417909,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTc045,1718294400,Crypto for Advisors: Advisors and Crypto,"At Consensus 2024, held in Austin, there was an exclusive RIA & FA Day session. Approximately 120 financial advisors spent the day learning about digital assets, engaging with industry thought leaders and networking with peers.  The energy was positive, and the conversations meaningful, with investors' interest in this asset class growing. Although the event was closed-door, key themes are worth sharing. Thank you to Adam Blumberg, one of the day's contributors, for highlighting trends and takeaways in today’s newsletter.  - Sarah Morton  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  Consensus 2024: A Breakthrough for Financial Advisors and Crypto Integration  Consensus 2024 marked a significant milestone for the crypto industry, driven by positive legislative developments and the approval of an Ethereum ETF. The atmosphere was electric, with enthusiasm reaching new heights.  FA/RIA Day: A Focused Learning Experience  Thursday was dedicated to financial advisors and registered investment advisors (FA/RIA), drawing approximately 120 professionals keen to explore integrating crypto into their practices. The day was filled with insightful discussions, networking opportunities and expert guidance.  The recent ETF approvals and bullish price trends have piqued the interest of more advisors and investors, creating a fertile ground for knowledge-sharing and growth.  Prioritizing Practical Integration Over Technical Jargon  The primary objective of FA/RIA Day was to provide actionable insights on incorporating crypto into financial practices. Instead of delving into the technical intricacies of blockchain and price movements, the focus was on practical application within a financial advisory context.  Education: The Cornerstone of Crypto Adoption  A recurring theme was the crucial role of education. Advisors must understand the available options, strategic allocation, investment theses, regulatory landscape and compliance requirements.  Equally important is the need to educate investors. Despite growing awareness of bitcoin and crypto, a significant knowledge gap persists. Effective education equips advisors to discuss crypto allocations confidently and have informed conversations with clients.  Exploring Investment Options  Panel discussions covered a range of investment options, including direct ownership, custody through SMA platforms, ETFs and investments in public companies like MicroStrategy and bitcoin mining companies.  Each option has its pros and cons.  While direct ownership embodies the ethos of crypto, it introduces compliance and administrative challenges that many advisors prefer to avoid.  ETFs provide price exposure to the underlying asset without the complexities of custody and reporting, making it easier for advisors to allocate within any account type, integrate investments into AUM and reporting, and facilitate rebalancing, as do public company investments.  Conversations and Portfolio Allocations  Understanding crypto is one thing; fitting it into a portfolio is another. Advisors shared their experiences in client conversations and their strategies for crypto allocation.  These discussions often involve setting realistic expectations, aligning with clients’ investment goals and conducting thorough risk assessments to gauge tolerance for volatility.  We heard that generally, advisors allocate 2-5% of a portfolio to crypto, categorizing it as an Alternative Investment. ETFs have enabled advisors to discuss the benefits of rebalancing and its positive impact on portfolio performance.  Advisors must also determine the most suitable accounts for crypto holdings, whether taxable or non-taxable, such as IRAs.  Navigating Compliance and Regulation  Crypto's intersection with politics in the U.S. adds a layer of complexity. Positive legislative momentum was evident just before Consensus, with several Democrats supporting pro-crypto regulation.  A conference highlight was a keynote chat by CFTC Commissioner Summer Mersinger, who outlined the CFTC's perspective on crypto regulation and its implications for financial advisors. The need for regulatory clarity remains paramount as advisors navigate this evolving landscape.  Conclusion  Consensus 2024 underscored the growing integration of crypto in financial advisory practices. By focusing on education, practical application and regulatory insights, advisors are better equipped to meet the rising demand for crypto investments and guide their clients through this dynamic asset class.  - Adam Blumberg, Interaxis  Keep Reading  Stock trading app Robinhood announced it has entered into an agreement to acquire crypto platform Bitstamp for $200 million.

42417910,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTc057,1718293465,"Before Meme Stocks, WallStreetBets Traders Mainlined Options","The crypto boom in the final months of 2017 woke up millions of people to the idea that you could get rich from your phone. In December alone, three million people downloaded the app for Coinbase, the main American crypto exchange. Coinbase had been much smaller and less popular than Robinhood, but in December, it got about six times more downloads.  Nathaniel Popper is the author of ""The Trolls of Wall Street: How the Outcasts and Insurgents Are Hacking the Markets"" (from which this article is excerpted) and ""Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money."" He has worked as a reporter for The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times and The Forward.  A month later, as the newly assembled crowds watched the value of bitcoin {{BTC}} and many other digital tokens plunge in January of 2018, those who had not lost their shirts completely went looking for an alternative place to direct their freshly awakened hunger for speculative excitement. TD Ameritrade reported that trading activity in January was up 48% from a year earlier, with the fastest growth coming from Millennial customers. It didn’t hurt that stocks had gone up alongside bitcoin. The benchmark S&P 500 index finished 2017 up 22%, its ninth positive year in a row.  Robinhood had missed the bitcoin boom, only announcing an expansion into crypto trading at the end of the bubble. But the company managed to have perfect timing for what came next. In December 2017, the start-up had announced it was about to begin allowing customers to trade options contracts. As it had with stocks, Robinhood eliminated the commissions that other brokers charged for options trading. The announcement had been largely ignored at the time because of the focus on crypto. But in January, attention quickly turned to the new capabilities opened up by Robinhood.  “Lost 5k in crypto, ready to lose another 5k trading options — where do I start to begin my path to autism?” one characteristic post asked in early 2018.  This was something of a replay of early 2015 when WallStreetBets had suddenly whirred to life in the wake of Robinhood’s initial launch. Now, after struggling in the shadow of crypto, WallStreetBets was again overflowing with newcomers eager to try out Robinhood’s latest offering.  “I’ve never seen an influx of noobs like there is right now,” one Reddit old-timer wrote. “It’s obviously because of RH.”  But this new burst of activity on WallStreetBets was viewed with much more suspicion than the previous one. Jaime had started the subreddit as a result of his interest in the alluring complexity of options. But after going through numerous bouts of losing, he realized, with the help of outsquare, that the odds were stacked against small-time investors in the options markets.  See also: Robert Alice Made NFT History, Now He's Writing About It  “If I have but a single regret of starting this wonderful community it is the incessant obsession and poor understanding of options,” Jaime wrote in a cautionary post.  Options, he wrote, are “incredibly stupid ways of throwing perfectly good money down the dark bowels of Wall Street.”  Trading options doesn’t necessarily look dangerous on its face. In the most basic terms, an option is just a way to bet on the future value of a stock without having to buy that stock. But there are lots of devilish risks buried in the intricate structure of options. The most obvious danger with options is that, unlike stocks, they expire on a specific date. If the stock price did not do what you had bet it would do by that date, you lose all the money you put in.  Due to the binary, win-or-lose nature of options, they are often referred to as the lottery tickets of the financial markets. If you own a stock and the price falls, it generally still has some value and you can wait for it to recover. But with an option, if your bet goes south, you are left with nothing — and that is indeed how it usually ends. The inherent risk of options is multiplied by the fact that most opions are pegged to the price of 100 shares of the underlying stock. This means they can go up much faster than the actual stock — an attractive feature for the risk-seeker — but they can go down just as fast.  Jordan had disagreed with Jaime on other things, but when it came to options, they found common ground. Like Jaime, Jordan warned users to stay away from options unless they had a very clear idea of what they were doing.  “options will make your dick fly off” was how Jordan put it. “it’s scientifically proven.”  But these voices of caution and the early posts about losses only seemed to rev up the appetite for risk on the subreddit. One user mentioned losing 93% of his portfolio. Right below that, another user quickly one-upped him with perverse pride: “To the guy who posted his 93% loss. This is a real 90% loss.” The post showed a picture of the Robinhood home screen with a line descending sharply from $22,000 to $2,000 in less than a month.  See also: 10 Great Novels About Money (and Crypto)  In 2018, WallStreetBets once again began to attract media coverage, and the articles took note of both the growth of the subreddit — which was up to 300,000 members by mid-2018—and the bizarre penchant members seemed to have for losing money. The first magazine profile of the website, in Money, was titled: “Meet the Bros Behind /r/WallStreetBets, Who Lose Hundreds of Thousands of Dollars in a Day — and Brag About It.”  The WallStreetBets regular featured at the top of the story was a 24-year-old programmer who had found options trading on Robinhood after making a small killing on crypto. He then managed to lose $180,000 in a matter of days on a single bet on Facebook stock.  Jaime had embraced many of the earlier questionable developments on WallStreetBets. But when the reporter for Money reached out to him, he expressed his discomfort. He said that he had founded the site with the goal of creating a “serious forum for learning” and emphasized that he was “not a huge fan of the memes.”  There was lots of talk about the strange imperviousness to losing money on the subreddit, and there would be for years to come. Jordan engaged with one member who said he had assumed the so-called loss porn was “an obscene joke,” before he realized that “it seems when asked seriously they really prefer losing money.”  Jordan explained his belief that the attitudes on the site were a coping mechanism. “People lose a bunch of money, they come laugh about it with others who lost a bunch of money, and everyone is happy. What’s better, to lose money and be bitter, or to lose money and feel like you fit in with the other guys? People take the path of least resistance emotionally.”  This rationale, though, seemed to hit on only one of the many factors that showed up in WallStreetBets posts in the course of 2018 to explain the rising penchant for extreme risk-taking.  One reason that many people gave for their willingness to bet on crypto and options was the precarious financial situation many of them had found themselves in — and their desire for a quick solution. Millennials were carrying unprecedented levels of student debt; in 2018, the average student-debt load of young Americans was more than twice what it had been back in the 1990s. For recent graduates trying to stay on top of the interest payments, the allure of a financial Hail Mary was obvious, especially when they looked at the escalating value of real estate and contemplated the difficulty of ever purchasing their own homes. One novice in 2018 pointed to these issues to explain his own decision to dive in.  “Hey guys, I’m $10,000 in debt and I’m thinking about day-trading stocks to overcome my financial woes! But first, how do you trade options?”  Once people got going, the internal feedback loop that got kicked off by trading often sucked them in further. The excitement of watching your portfolio go up stimulates the same neurotransmitters associated with other addictive activities, creating jolts of dopamine that can quickly generate a desire for more. Researchers have found that young men — the core audience on WallStreetBets — are particularly prone to this sort of addictive behavior and that fast-moving options play on these dynamics more than stocks. There were countless posts from people who said they found themselves almost helpless as they chased the high and ended up losing both their profits and the original money they put in.  “Options are like heroin,” one user explained. “You try a little bit once and nothing hits the same ever again.”  This got particularly problematic for the many young men who had been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, as was the case for more and more young men in America. People with ADHD generally do not produce enough dopamine or they have difficulty processing it, which often leads them to seek out activities that will create more of the pleasure-producing hormone. Jaime was one of many people in the early chat room who talked about his ADHD diagnosis. He observed that this seemed to be at least partly responsible for his attraction to both alcohol and trading, and research indeed shows that people with ADHD are much more vulnerable to gambling addictions.  Robinhood played on all these instincts in its young customers in a way that no other brokerage firm had ever done before. The company added lots of little special effects that increased the dopamine-inducing qualities of the app, most famously showering users with digital confetti whenever they bought or sold a stock. The company also took away many of the little reminders of risk and the points of friction that other brokerage firms put in front of customers before they completed a trade; friction that allowed customers to take a beat and consider whether the trade was a wise one. Natasha Dow Schüll, an academic expert on gambling, later pointed out that Robinhood used many of the same tactics that Las Vegas casinos employed to get their customers to forget their losses and place another bet.  But long before Robinhood showed up with its gamified version of options trading, young men were coming to WallStreetBets seeking the kind of risk and drama that the subreddit put on display, even when it involved losing money. Social media had, of course, played a role in this. Researchers have found that young men are more willing to take bigger risks when they are in the company of other young men, and the crowds on Reddit certainly egged each other on.  For the average young denizen of 4chan who was stuck at home without a job or friends, the internet was a place to do stupid things to create a little excitement and achieve a few minutes of online fame. Losing money was often the easiest path to achieving these goals. Dale Beran, the 4chan expert, argued that the site had long before developed a culture that elevated failure to a kind of art form.  See also: What's at the Intersection of Crypto and AI? Perhaps Murder  “It is a culture of hopelessness, of knowing ‘the system is rigged,’” Beran argued.  The nihilistic attitude on WallStreetBets was made manifest by the image of the tendies, the preferred way to describe any winnings a trader managed to eke out of the markets. The term, which came from 4chan, referred to the chicken tenders a young basement dweller might get from his mom as a reward for good behavior. If your portfolio was just so many chicken nuggets that your mom could always replenish, who cared if you lost a few? This attitude came out when a trader who went by a crude username shot to fame by making over half a million with Robinhood options and then, just as loudly, making it all disappear.  “At The End of the Day, Money is Just Paper,” he wrote in the post announcing his biggest losses.  Jordan got asked about these bizarre dynamics when the latest reporter showed up, this one from Vice. “One thing I always notice about chan sites is this underlying nihilism,” the reporter, Roisin Kiberd, said. “Even way before the alt right and pepe and trump stuff. So I was wondering if that’s present on WSB too. Like, burn it all, lose your money.”  Jordan initially responded by pointing to the contagious, addictive nature of trading. “I think of trading like getting leprosy,” he told the reporter. “Once someone has the bug you have no idea if they’ll make it. Sometimes it costs them an arm and a leg.”  But he acknowledged that losing had become a central element of the community dynamic. “At the end of the day we’re just a bunch of guys at varying levels of seriousness trying to make it in something that people will tell you is impossible. Helps to have company,” he said. “Nobody wants to sit at their computer alone for years.”  Jordan had continued to struggle to make any money from his own efforts in the markets, despite all the advice he had gotten from lakai and outsquare. He knew that his nervous energy haunted his best trades.  “patience has been like the hardest part of this shit for me  “how often are you right but you don’t wait for it to go sideways and then do what you expected,” he said in the chat room.  “no patience no money,” lakai chimed in.  “I tried copying lakai,” Jordan told the others.  “you just can’t  “you end up being one of those cargo cult people  “waving your hands hoping a 747 will land.”  Jordan took long breaks from trading and spent more time playing video games with his fellow moderators or coming up with new bots to deal with the problems cropping up on the growing subreddit. As traffic to the site grew, Jordan, lakai, and a rotating cast of moderators developed an increasingly complex set of rules and structures to make the deluge of content navigable. Reddit’s system of elevating posts with more upvotes provided a basic order. But as WallStreetBets began to attract hundreds of posts every day — and thousands of comments — things could easily get out of whack unless the moderating team kept a careful watch.  Lakai and the other moderators created systems so that it was easier to find particular genres of content on the subreddit. They used labels — or flair, as they were known on Reddit—to distinguish the more serious posts with due diligence, or DD, from the so-called loss-porn and meme posts. Jordan created increasingly sophisticated bots to ensure the rules were followed. But they inevitably made errors, and a lot of the work fell to Jordan and a few others who would manually go through the queues to ensure the wrong posts hadn’t been deleted or allowed through.  In addition to doing the digital grunt work and coding, Jordan also brought a very human touch to the job. Unlike outsquare and Jaime, who moderated with a light hand, Jordan constantly roamed the comment sections beneath posts, giving advice and prodding the guys on the site to be smarter. He would jump in to point out obvious trading mistakes and chide people when they acted as though losing money were the point of the game rather than a regrettable side effect:  “You’re not ‘doing it right’ when you post massive losses and go ‘hurr am I one of the boys now’? It’s like a bunch of morons saw some veteran traders comparing battle scars and decided to cut themselves so they could join the conversation and get attention.”  See also: Crypto Author Jimmy Song Talks About His Little Bitcoin Book  He also stepped into the role that outsquare had played in the early chat room, a sort of gruff therapist. He went into action toward the end of 2018 when a post showed up that underscored the real-world damage that could result from the attention-seeking pursuit of riches.  “I broke down crying on the subway today,” one of the recent losers wrote. “I saved up $5k in 2 months working as a busser. Grew my portfolio to around $11k quit bussing and lost it all trading options and will have to find work again in a shitty restaurant. I have no future. I have no education or skills. I work as a shitty busser and i’m 23. It’s pathetic. I have no girlfriend and never have had one. I don’t know what to do or how to make money to escape this shitty cycle. I’m ending it all by 25.”  Jordan pinned this post and his own response to the top of the site. “I’m gonna leave this one up so OP” — an acronym for original poster — “can see that WSB cares about him even if we look like a bunch of assholes most of the time.”  Jordan urged the guy to take a break from trading and try to look at things from a different perspective: “Don’t throw away your most precious and irreplaceable asset because you lost some money. You’re in your 20s, even if you died at 60 most of your life is still ahead of you. You’d be surprised what reality can serve up that you might never have expected.”  When the commenters below expressed their gratitude to Jordan for his sympathetic intervention and the work he was putting in, he did not let it go to his head: “I am trying to do good by the sub even though I’m just a dork on the internet with an ego too.”  But soon enough, there were indications that Jordan’s hopes for the subreddit were coming true. The gathered multitudes were learning lessons from their mistakes, and from one another.

42417902,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTbzun,1718293150,Bitcoin Mining Stabilizes Power Grids Strained by AI Data Centers,"Microsoft is building huge AI data centers in Arizona and Wisconsin to provide the infrastructure for powering this transformational technology. And AI is hot — literally.  Such data centers put a severe strain on power grids by requiring vast amounts of electricity. By 2026, one estimate forecasts AI will consume about 40 gigawatts (GW) of the projected 96 GW in global power demand from data centers, up from a total demand of 49 GW in 2023. This energy use generates a lot of heat and requires a lot of water to cool down data servers. With an estimated usage of 56 million gallons of water a year from Microsoft's data center in Goodyear, Arizona alone, the local desert communities risk running out of water to accommodate their new power hungry neighbors.  On the other hand, while often criticized as an “energy hog,” Bitcoin mining is actually an amazing way to help make power grids more stable and efficient. This is due to a Bitcoin miner’s ability to adjust energy usage in near real-time.  To keep a power grid at the correct frequency, grid operators must “balance” the power grid by adjusting energy production to match user demand. This process is called “load following.” Historically, increasing and decreasing energy production was the only real-time response action grid operators had available to them. But now, during periods of high or low electricity demand, Bitcoin miners can quickly adjust their power consumption to create a second, real-time response action that grid operators can use to establish balance.  Since renewable energy production fluctuates with the weather and is difficult to ramp up or ramp down to establish grid balance, Bitcoin mining is proving to be a scalable and economically feasible variable load solution. This new grid balancing pattern, made possible through Bitcoin mining, has now paved the way for use by new, larger and less flexible AI power consumers.  But why can't AI simply adjust its energy usage in real-time also? Bitcoin miners’ energy usage has a unique aspect compared to AI data centers. The Bitcoin network is a constant customer that is not adversely affected by miners throttling down or turning off their equipment. However, if an AI data center turns off some of its servers to throttle down AI compute, customers are adversely affected.  This flexibility makes Bitcoin mining an effective way to stabilize power grids – especially in helping manage electricity consumption from large AI data centers – because it can quickly respond to fluctuations in electricity supply and demand.  We see states like Oklahoma embracing this model by encouraging Bitcoin mining and its power grid benefits. On May 30, the state senate passed a bill to make the sales of machinery and equipment used for commercial mining tax exempt if the miner provides an adjustable load to the local power producer.  Texas, Scandinavia and Iceland  Texas has invested heavily in wind energy production, leading to periods that put extra strain on power grids because energy supply often exceeds local demand (especially at night).  By increasing their activity during off-peak hours, Bitcoin miners consume this surplus of excess electricity generated from wind energy that would otherwise remain unused due to lack of demand during these periods. Their energy consumption stabilizes the delicate balance between electricity supply and demand and helps prevent the grid from becoming overloaded, which can lead to disruptions such as blackouts.  During a destructive winter storm in February 2021, Texas experienced severe power outages because it couldn’t meet the sudden surge in electricity demand. Bitcoin miners there were able to shut down their operations quickly, reducing their load and helping to stabilize the power grid during this crisis.  Scandinavia is another region where wind turbines dot the landscape. Here wind energy is produced in excess during off-peak hours and would otherwise be wasted due to lack of immediate demand and storage solutions. Bitcoin mining facilities are dynamically using this surplus, providing a sizable demand while helping maintain equilibrium and overall efficiency within the grid.  In Iceland, where geothermal and hydroelectric power production is abundant, Bitcoin mining operations have become integral to the energy market. The country’s renewable energy sources generate more electricity than its population can reasonably use. Bitcoin miners consume this excess electricity, providing a flexible, consistent demand that supports the nation’s renewable energy industry.  Making Renewable Energy More Viable  Bitcoin miners’ stabilizing effect on power grids has another interesting benefit: improving the financial viability of renewable energy projects. How?  Wind and solar often provide lower-cost electricity compared to fossil fuels like coal, which is a crucial factor for Bitcoin miners seeking to maximize profitability. However, renewables often face challenges due to the intermittency of their power generation and the gap between supply and demand. For example, solar panels produce the most energy during the day when demand is relatively low, while wind turbines may generate more power at night.  But by providing a constant and predictable demand, Bitcoin miners can bridge this gap and ensure a steady revenue stream for wind farms in Texas and Scandinavia and hydropower plants in Iceland. (Norway generated a whopping 98% of its energy from renewable resources in 2020, including 92% from hydropower). In addition, this positive financial impact from Bitcoin miners helps make renewable energy projects more economically attractive and can encourage the use of sustainable, clean energy solutions worldwide.  The Road Ahead  Bitcoin mining, AI data centers, and renewable energy projects intersect and provide good opportunities for innovation in energy management. Smart grid software that uses real-time data analytics to optimize electricity production and distribution will eventually integrate seamlessly into Bitcoin mining operations. This integration will further enhance power grid efficiency and reliability, especially in areas of rapidly growing populations and where big AI data centers are located.  Global energy production and distribution is incredibly complex, competitive, and highly subject to political, economic, and regulatory forces. So the ability of Bitcoin miners to stabilize and optimize power grids – especially in regions with significant renewable energy resources and/or energy-intensive AI data centers – makes them invaluable partners in the expansion of renewable energy production and overall energy management.

42417903,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTbzxt,1718292905,Biden’s Nonsensical Proposed 30% Tax Would Kill Bitcoin Mining in the U.S.,"The Biden administration recently re-introduced a proposed that would place a 30% tax on all “cryptocurrency miners” – a move that represents an ideological witch hunt against a rapidly growing industry (see my previous comments).  The move, part of the government's budget proposal for the upcoming fiscal year introduced in March, is in stark contrast to recent, pro-crypto statements from former President Donald Trump, who just this week called for the U.S. to dominate the bitcoin mining sector. It remains to be seen whether the crypto mining excise tax will come into effect (or whether Trump will deliver on his aggressive crypto policies if elected), though in recent weeks many have begun to argue that President Biden may be softening on the industry.  See also: Trump's Appeal to Bitcoin Miners Is a Wakeup Call for Crypto to Stay Apolitical | Opinion  It has to be stated that implementing a blanket 30% federal tax on digital asset mining will kill the sector and wipe out billions of dollars of investor value in the United States, and very likely in Canada as well, given how the current Canadian federal administration closely follows U.S. precedents on regulation.  Taras Kulyk is founder and CEO of SunnySide Digital.  Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.  In the “land of the free,” this type of heavy handed Stalinesque central planning directive screams in the face of the democratic ideals (ironically) that are supposed to be espoused by the current White House administration. First, they came for your digital mining and you did nothing…  The fine print on Biden’s proposed tax  The egregious mining tax, implemented despite the billions of dollars invested in the sector, is part of his budget proposal for the fiscal year 2025, which aims to address environmental concerns and regulate the digital asset mining industry. The proposal suggests that the tax would be phased in over three years, starting at 10% in the first year, increasing to 20% in the second year and reaching the full 30% in the third year. This tax is prejudicing digital mining, exclusively, not data centers generally.  The administration argues that the tax is necessary to combat the environmental impacts of cryptocurrency mining, including its high energy consumption and the potential to raise energy prices for communities hosting mining operations, in the face of the well established research that this line of concern is the exact opposite of economic reality and operational impact for power utilities.  While I'm not a lawyer, and these arguments should be taken with a grain of salt, it’s important to note that it is likely unconstitutional for a presidential administration to tax a specific industry's energy usage. There is simply no precedent for it.  By targeting a specific industry with an energy consumption tax, the government could be seen as violating a number of clauses, including The Commerce Clause in Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the U.S. Constitution, the Equal Protection Clause found in the 14th amendment, the Due Process clause found in the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution or under the statute of unintended consequences.  Moreover, there are ethical implications at play beyond any potential unconstitutional overreach. This type of deception has become far too commonplace and is something the U.S. founding fathers were aware of and tried to prevent via the Constitution itself.  How to kill an emerging industry 101  The Biden administration's proposed tax would impose a significant financial burden on digital mining companies, very likely making their operations economically unviable. As these companies already face intense competition and tight margins, this tax would only exacerbate financial struggles and lead to material investor losses.  As a result, many mining firms would likely be forced to shut down or relocate to other countries with more favorable tax policies, leading to job losses and reduced economic activity in the United States.  Moreover, the proposed tax would disproportionately affect smaller digital mining operations, which may not have the resources to absorb the additional costs or move to other jurisdictions. This would create an unleveled playing field, favoring larger, more established mining companies and stifling competition and innovation in the sector as well as increasing centralization for larger operators.  If this administration’s goal is to hurt small businesses, stifle innovation and develop a reputation for reducing economic activity in the U.S, then they are right on track.  Environmental concerns and the ineffectiveness of the tax  The Biden administration claims that the proposed tax is necessary to address the environmental impact of bitcoin mining, as it consumes significant amounts of electricity. However, this argument overlooks the fact that many mining operations already use renewable energy sources and are actively working to reduce their carbon footprint.  Furthermore, the proposal does not take into consideration use of methods like methane flaring, which reduces the CO2-equivalent emissions by about 63% when compared to traditional methods of flaring methane, and landfill mining, which in one year has the same effect of planting five million trees and letting them grow for 10 years. Bitcoin mining has been proven to strengthen grids and even reduce energy costs for local communities.  In fact, imposing a tax on energy consumption could discourage these efforts and incentivize miners to use less environmentally friendly sources of power overseas. What will happen is a mass exodus of miners out of the U.S., which has the most renewable energy makeup, and shift them overseas where fossil fuels are more predominantly used.  The fact is, about 90% of carbon emissions come from outside the United States. Because tackling ""environmental concerns"" is a global problem, they would only be contributing to the problem by their own logic.  So what should the government do? Nothing. Let the free market reign. Bitcoin miners are the dung beetles of energy. They go to where the energy is cheapest, and because of the upfront operational expenses of fossil fuel miners and low operational expenses of renewables, it’s easy to see why the majority of mining comes from renewable sources to begin with.  Global competition  The bitcoin mining industry is highly competitive, with countries such as China, Russia and Canada vying for dominance. The proposed tax would undermine the United States' position in this global race, as it would make the country a less attractive destination for mining operations. This could result in a significant loss of investment, talent and technological advancements, ultimately weakening the United States' role in the digital economy.  One lesson learned after China banned bitcoin mining in 2021 was the resilience and adaptability of the bitcoin mining industry. Despite the ban, bitcoin mining operations found new homes in countries with more favorable regulatory environments and access to renewable energy sources. This demonstrated that the Bitcoin network is not geographically confined and can adjust to regulatory changes.  Additionally, the shift to more sustainable energy sources highlighted the potential for bitcoin mining to contribute positively to the global energy transition  Moreover, the tax could also have broader implications for the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. By targeting bitcoin mining, the Biden administration may inadvertently discourage innovation and investment in the industry, which could have far-reaching consequences for the country's technological development and competitiveness.  You can’t ban mining, you can only ban yourself  In summary, the Biden administration's proposed tax on bitcoin mining would have severe negative consequences for the industry and the broader digital economy in the United States, and therefore its own initiatives.  See also: Bitcoin Miners Show Muscle Pushing Back Against a Warrantless EIA Survey  It would impose a significant financial burden on mining companies, discourage sustainable mining practices and undermine the country's competitiveness in the global market. This type of measure is more aligned with oppressive countries like China or what the USSR was like, and it is incredibly disheartening to see from the United States.  Just like the industry rallied to defeat the unconstitutional EIA survey, we should put the same attention here.

29427702,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=624394,1718292605,UNI In Trouble? Key Indicators Cites Potential Drop Amid Market Downturn,"Uniswap (UNI), a prominent decentralized exchange token, is bracing for further declines as the broader cryptocurrency market experiences a significant downturn. Recent market trends indicate a continuation of bearish momentum, which has impacted UNI’s price negatively. Several factors, including macroeconomic uncertainties, regulatory pressures, and shifts in investor sentiment, are contributing to this extended downtrend. As Uniswap’s price breaks key support levels, the likelihood of additional losses increases. This article delves into UNI’s price analysis with the help of technical indicators to determine the anticipated decline and provide insights into what traders and investors might expect in the coming days. The price of Uniswap has increased by 4.60%, trading at about $9.873 in the last 24 hours, with a market capitalization of more than $5.9 billion and a trading volume of more than $356 million as of the time of writing. UNI’s market cap and trading volume were also up by 4.28% and 19.98%, respectively. UNI Builds Bearish Sentiment On the 1-hour chart, UNI is attempting to move below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) as it has failed to move above the bearish trendline. It can be suggested here that Uniswap might go bearish. The 1-hour Composite Trend Oscillator also signals that the price of UNI might break below the 100-day SMA and go bearish as both the signal line and SMA crossed and are heading toward the zero line. From this Relative Strength Index (RSI) formation, it can be considered that UNI might go bearish if it moves below the 100-day SMA. Meanwhile, in the 4-hour chart, UNI’s price trades below the trendline and the 100-day SMA. The price of UNI is also attempting to drop a bearish 4-hour candlestick. Although the 4-hour composite trend oscillator indicates that UNI may go bullish, the price will certainly move upward on a short-term note and begin to decline again. The signal line and SMA line are heading toward the zero line, but this has continued for a while. Support Levels To Watch Out For If the price of UNI drops below the 1-hour 100-day simple moving average, it will begin to move towards the $8.748 support level. It may even decline more to test the $7.557 support level if it breaks below the abovementioned level. However, if Uniswap were to change course at any of the previously mentioned support levels, it would begin to rise toward the resistance level of $10.381. If the price breaches this resistance level, it might be poised to test the $11.801 mark and perhaps much higher to test other levels.

42417905,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTbzzx,1718291091,"Ether ETFs Should Be Fully Approved by September, Says SEC Chair Gensler","Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler suggested the ether ETFs are really already approved and all that remains are the registration details getting hammered out at the staff level.  Gensler repeated his complaints about the noncompliant crypto industry, demurred on answering whether ETH is a commodity and argued that the CFTC isn't ready to police crypto markets.  Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Rostin Behnam also addressed his agency's effort to ban elections contracts in the prediction markets.  The final approvals for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) trading Ethereum's ether {{ETH}} should be finished this summer, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler told senators in a budget hearing on Thursday.  Gensler told a subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee in a hearing justifying the market regulator's budget that the process is ""working smoothly"" after the initial approval of a group of ETFs. The agency had previously granted the initial round of applications but he said the final registration requirements – filings known as S-1s – are now being handled at the ""staff level.""  Once those filings are approved, the new ETFs can be listed, opening the wider markets to easy-to-trade funds that hold actual ether, much like the earlier establishment of bitcoin spot ETFs that hold {{BTC}}. The SEC had initially blocked the effort for bitcoin ETFs until a federal court ruled the agency was mishandling the matter, and Gensler has said the SEC has since been following that decision and allowing them.  When asked directly whether ETH is a commodity, Gensler didn't respond with a yes or no, maintaining the uncertain position his agency has held on that asset. At the same hearing, when asked whether it's a commodity, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chief Rostin Behnam responded, ""Yes.""  The question is important when trying to seek the proper U.S. watchdog for various tokens. The SEC will oversee securities tokens and the CFTC will have authority over the rest. While Gensler has repeatedly said the vast majority of digital assets should be considered securities, he refuses to identify which ones fit in which basket apart from those his agency has listed in enforcement actions.  ""While not all crypto are crypto securities – some are under Chair Behnam's jurisdiction – those that are have an obligation to disclose to the public,"" Gensler said, repeating his argument that most of the tokens remain unregistered and are violating the securities law.  Gensler, who has run both agencies as chairman, said that the industry is ""thumbing its nose"" at the rules. He also suggested the CFTC isn't currently well-prepared to police a disclosure-based system of oversight, because that's not what it does, unlike the SEC.  Behnam noted the CFTC still doesn't have some of the necessary authorities for policing the crypto markets if – as certainly legislative efforts in Congress would direct – it gets more responsibility for overseeing crypto trading.  ""We don't have those traditional regulatory tools – registration, custody, surveillance, oversight – that have really made American capital markets and derivative markets so strong,"" he said, adding that the CFTC would need a bigger budget to make that happen.  Behnam was also asked about prediction markets popularized at such firms as PredictIt, Polymarket, Zeitgeist and Kalshi and his agency's stand against contracts predicting the outcome of elections. His agency recently moved to block such contracts.  ""The last thing we need right now is sort of commoditizing elections,"" Behnam said. ""This, in my view, is clearly against existing law, and we're taking steps to make sure they're banned.""

The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) announced its decision to shutter FlowBank on Thursday, saying the lender “no longer had sufficient capital for its operations as a bank” and that minimum capital requirements had been “significantly and seriously breached.” FINMA also said that there are “well-founded concerns that the bank is currently over-indebted,” with “no prospect” of a restructuring.  In a letter to customers posted on FlowBank’s website, the bank said FINMA’s decision to shut it down had been made yesterday. Walder Wyss, a top Swiss law firm, has been appointed by FINMA to serve as bankruptcy liquidators for the bank.  FlowBank launched in 2020 and had extensive crypto ties, including partial ownership by crypto asset manager CoinShares which, in 2021, purchased a 9% stake in the bank for $11.8 million. After CoinShares’ investment, the bank began offering its customers the ability to buy, sell and hold crypto and other tokenized assets directly from their FlowBank accounts.  Earlier this year, it was reported that Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, would allow larger traders to hold their crypto assets at FlowBank or Sygnum, another crypto-friendly Swiss bank.  According to a document posted on FINMA’s website, FlowBank customers with up to 100,000 Swiss francs (approximately $111,710) in deposits are considered protected, and will receive their money back within seven working days.  The future of customers’ crypto deposits, however, is less clear. FINMA has said that it is up to the liquidator whether the cryptocurrencies are classified as custody assets that will be treated like securities in the bankruptcy process, or whether they will be treated as “claims on the bank.”  FlowBank could not be reached for comment.

While wallets directly connected to Tate have not sold any DADDY tokens since their issuance on June 9, some other wallets seemingly purchased 30% of the token’s supply before it was promoted widely on X.  “On June 9th at 21:24 UTC, @DaddyTateCTO sent 40% of the $DADDY supply to @Cobratate,” BubbleMaps posted. @Cobratate is Tate’s official X account. “But here's the catch: 11 wallets, funded through Binance with nearly identical amounts at the same time, bought 20% of $DADDY on June 9th, before @DaddyTateCTO's first tweet.”  Two other clusters tracked by Bubblemaps hold another 10% of the token’s supply, worth $30 million at current prices.  As such, trading pools of the tokens have just over $2.4 million in available liquidity, meaning the positions cannot be realized for their entire value as of Thursday.  Tate’s own wallet, which has not sold tokens as of Thursday, holds $65 million worth of the tokens at current prices.  This is the first crypto token the controversial social media star appears to be directly involved in—an association that helped move the token to a $240 million market capitalization just three days after going live. DEXTools data shows that prices are up 55% in the past 24 hours.  DADDY is the latest in a line of celebrity-backed tokens that have started to make rounds in the meme coin ecosystem. Unlike previous instances where celebrities were marketing projects or protocols, these tokens are actively issued, backed, and promoted by famous personalities, mainly on X.

42417891,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTbzlV,1718288048,In Defense of Fundamental Analysis Amid Memecoin Mania,"Memecoins embody the “Wild West” image of DeFi. Thanks to the stratospheric success of tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), the memecoin market collectively boasts a market cap of $54.4 billion – a number that would’ve seemed outrageous when these assets first emerged. And yet here we are.  As recently as March, memecoin trade volumes hit levels last seen just prior to the last crypto bubble’s implosion in 2022. This resurgence highlights a familiar trend: traders are easily swept up in hype and FOMO, to the extent that they make impulsive investment decisions based on pure instinct and greed. In Digital Asset Valuation Framework, the team at HashKey Capital and I set out the case for applying fundamental valuation frameworks and high-level technical analysis to navigate the market’s inherent volatility and avoid the pitfalls of memecoin mania.  Without putting too fine a point on it, now more than ever we must deploy robust frameworks and exercise cold-eyed judgment to discern genuine value in this most turbulent of markets. This is doubly true for institutional investors looking to gain a sustainable edge and long-term value accretion in digital assets.  The Importance of Fundamental Analysis  In any financial market, there are times when speculative hype can overshadow rational investment strategy. See the dot-com bubble, subprime mortgage meltdown, and countless other examples.  In crypto, speculative hype is on steroids, propelled by endless chatter on socials and a sense that the next moonshot token is right under your nose. Financial Times correspondent Joshua Oliver has written a new book about this phenomenon (“Hype Machine”) focused largely on Sam Bankman-Fried and the cautionary tale of FTX.  See also: Dan Kuhn - In Defense of Meme Coins  Fundamental analysis provides the necessary grounding to understand the intrinsic value of a digital asset, beyond the smokescreen of publicity and propaganda disseminated by clever marketers, hubristic project founders, self-motivated airdrop farmers and the rest.  Critical factors to consider when weighing up the merits of a Web3 investment include the project team’s track record, the underlying technology used, the practical use cases of what is being built, and tangible evidence of real-world adoption.  This kind of old-school, meat-and-potatoes analysis enables investors to look beyond brief bursts of market excitement and evaluate the long-term viability of a project. It’s an approach based less on short-term trading gains and more on sustainable value creation. That said, many projects with zero long-term viability can still enrich some investors.  Beyond Memecoins  The allure of memecoins is understandable, even setting aside the incessant media buzz and viral marketing. Although often ridiculed for their lack of substantive value, memecoins have surprised the world with their performance. A staggering 12,000% increase in the value of DOGE in the first five months of 2021 is just one example of this (although the price had fallen by 80% by mid-December). More recently, Dogwifhat and Pepe have produced similar results – the former helped liquid fund Stratos post a 137% return in Q1.  While memecoins typically lack fundamental value and utility, their fortunes wane according to the conviction of traders who participate in speculation. That doesn’t mean one can simply will a memecoin into value, however. Engaging in memecoin markets without thorough analysis and a clear understanding of the risks involved is effectively gambling, not investing.  The importance of fundamental analysis – particularly in these volatile markets – cannot be overstated. These tools empower investors to make decisions based on meticulous research and solid evidence, rather than a reckless impulse to chase the next improbable moonshot  Meaningful valuation frameworks – including those that can be used to value memecoins, too – can help provide a more grounded understanding of market dynamics in times of volatility. By using these techniques, we can all see the hype for what it is – “fairy dust,” to quote McConaughey’s wired character in “Wolf of Wall Street,” that might be magical for a lucky few, but ineffective for nearly everybody else.

The bank said that the majority of the $16 billion inflow into spot bitcoin ETFs likely came from existing digital wallets on exchanges.  JPMorgan said it was skeptical that the pace of inflows will continue for the rest of the year.  Digital assets have seen $12 billion of net inflows year-to-date, and if flows continue at the same pace the number could grow to $26 billion by the end of the year, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report on Wednesday.  Spot bitcoin {{BTC}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have led the way, attracting $16 billion of net inflows, the report said. This number, when combined with Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) futures flows plus capital raised by crypto venture capital funds, increases the total inflow into digital asset markets this year to $25 billion.  Still, not all of these inflows are new money entering the crypto space. “We believe there has likely been a significant rotation away from digital wallets on exchanges to the new spot bitcoin ETFs,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.  This rotation is evidenced in the drop in bitcoin reserves across exchanges since the spot ETFs launched in January, which is estimated at 0.22 million bitcoin or $13 billion, the bank said.  “This implies that the majority of the $16 billion inflow into spot bitcoin ETFs since launch likely reflects a rotation from existing digital wallets on exchanges,” the authors wrote. Using this assumption reduces the net flow into digital assets year-to-date to $12 billion from $25 billion, the bank said.  This $12 billion net inflow is stronger than last year but is notably lower than during the bull run of 2021/2022, the report added.  Given how high the bitcoin price is relative to miners’ production cost or relative to the cost of gold, JPMorgan said it is skeptical that inflows will continue at the same rate for the rest of the year.

29423940,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=624454,1718287250,"Solana On-Chain Indicators Suggests A Return Of Bullish Sentiment, Is It Time To Buy SOL?","Certain on-chain indicators paint a bullish picture for Solana (SOL), suggesting this may be an excellent time to purchase the crypto token. This aligns with Solana’s price movement on the chart, with technical analysts predicting that an upward trend might be on the horizon. Solana Enjoying Greater Adoption Data from the market Intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shows that the number of daily addresses on the Solana network has been growing at an impressive rate. On June 11, over 1 million new addresses transacted on the Solana network. This development is significant as SOL could enjoy future price surges as more new users continue to trade on the network. Related Reading: Famous Analyst Dave The Wave Says Bitcoin Still Has Wiggle Room, Sets $300,000 Target The massive growth enjoyed by the Solana network has also translated to greater trading volume on the network, which is also bullish for the crypto token. Data from DappRadar shows that there has been a 62% increase in transaction volume on the Solana chain in the last 24 hours, with over 8.83 million transactions processed during this period. Interstingly, Solana stands tall in this metric, as no other chain has processed this many transactions during this period. Solana has also processed more transactions than every other chain in the last seven days, with over 59.55 million transactions processed within this timeframe. The growing interest in SOL has been partly thanks to the meme coin ecosystem on the network. Solana has become the go-to platform for traders looking to make massive profits from meme coins, which have so far been the best-performing crypto assets in this bull run. Solana’s reputation as the home for meme coins has even attracted celebrities like Australian rapper Iggy Azalea, Caitlyn Jenner, and Andrew Tate to the network. Bearing this in mind, it only seems like a matter of time before Solana’s price reacts positively to its network growth and ever-increasing network activity. Time To Buy SOL? Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa suggested that now might be a good time to buy Solana ahead of the meteoric price rally, which it could enjoy soon enough. The analyst said he expects “bigger things” for SOL later this year. For now, he expects Solana to keep chopping between $185 and $120 and just continue to witness a “prolonged period of consolidation.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction: Major Analysts Say BTC Is Headed For 6-Digit ATH This period of consolidation is usually a good time for investors to accumulate the crypto token, considering that coins typically enjoy a parabolic uptrend after consolidating for a while. Meanwhile, Altcoin Sherpa claimed that this period of consolidation is healthy for Solana, given the huge run it has already had, rising to a yearly high of $209 on March 18. As to how Solana can rise, Altcoin Sherpa previously predicted that the crypto token will rise above $500 this year.",POSITIVE,BTC | SOL,ALTCOIN | BTC | ICO | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-return-of-bullish-sentiment/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

Last month, I was selected to talk at the New Voices stage at Consensus 2024 about public goods funding, a tiny niche of crypto that I had dedicated the majority of my Web3 career to pursuing. I knew so much about this topic and was eager to share it with the world. But as I started writing it all down on paper, it all felt too intangible. Do any of us get it?  Sophia Dew, tech lead at the Public Goods Network, was a speaker on the “New Voices” track at Consensus 2024.  I started drafting my talk, explaining how money powers incentives and therefore powers how world-changing innovation enters the world. When government funding for research took off in the 1950s, it led to breakthroughs in science, medicine and technology. Similarly, the growth of venture capital over the past few decades, led to the acceleration of startups and innovative companies. My argument: crypto is powering a bottoms-up scalable way of distributing funding into areas that need it most. At least, this is the hope. However, trying to find mainstream, tangible examples has been few and far between.  Of course, that's not to say there aren't any. I know several passionate projects that are making this a reality, such as GainForest, tackling deforestation through a transparent and automated system that distributes funding directly to locals who show proof of conservation efforts. Or VoiceDeck, enabling journalists to receive retroactive funding through community-driven decision making. I was part of several quadratic funding rounds on Gitcoin that distributed millions of dollars in matching funds to projects based on the number of unique donors. These projects inspired me for what blockchain could do for the world. Yet, at the same time, I was disheartened that this was just a tiny, tiny, tiny sliver of what the focus of this industry is all about.  I spent the latter half of last year leading the technical development and adoption of Public Goods Network, a Layer 2 blockchain aimed at creating sustainable and durable funding for public goods through sequencer fees. We were competing with a lot of other blockchains to incentivize builders, fill up blockspace, and grow out our ecosystem. The most effective tactic available was money. Ecosystems were racing to allocate capital in the hopes of increasing the overall value of the chain.  Some of these programs were effective — such as Optimism’s RetroPGF. This mechanism retroactively funds the most impactful projects based on the collective wisdom and decision making of the community. RetroPGF was the first large-scale, mainstream funding mechanism I witnessed of how crypto is now powering a coordinated, transparent, and tamper-proof way of distributing funding into areas that need it most.  In my opinion, this was a crazy-successful experiment. Each round was run like a scientific experiment, with hypotheses and control variables, so that they get better and better at accurately assessing and rewarding impact every time. Soon after, other blockchain ecosystems followed suit, such as Filecoin and Celo, who ran RetroPGF rounds for their communities earlier this Spring.  As exciting as this was, I still wondered why the main adopters of these funding mechanisms were other blockchain ecosystems. Was everything this niche of crypto doing just for improving blockchain grant programs?  My answer: yes and no.  Public goods funding mechanisms are typically dismissed as simply DAO tooling or a social good initiative. However, in the race to scale and capture market share, these mechanisms have become a competitive advantage. Blockchain ecosystems are dogfooding these novel tools and protocols at an unprecedented speed. As these open-source tools get better, it becomes easier for any ecosystem (not just blockchains) to fund what matters to them.  Onchain ecosystems are made up of thousands of people from all around the world who are designing novel forms of economic and governance structures around their shared goals. This is a big deal. For the history of humankind, these systems were designed top-down. But now, blockchain enables bottoms-up global networks to design systems that align with their values.  We are building technology that has the potential to completely revolutionize how capital flows through society and how power and money is concentrated. While right now, blockchain-based funding mechanisms are still in their infancy, as the industry matures, we will begin to see ecosystems rivaling the size of nation-states, rally incentives and allocate capital towards areas that need it most.  To those trying to grow an ecosystem, I encourage you to run experiments and share your learnings publicly. Collective knowledge is how we as an industry can realize these goals faster.  To outside speculators, I urge you to thoroughly examine the governance and economic models powering these blockchains. Are tokens being distributed in ways that benefit an entire ecosystem, or just a centralized group of decision makers? Understand the levers and drivers that power these systems and recognize that your decisions have an impact on how they are designed.  I know when people talk about blockchains potential for rewriting economies and governance systems, it's often dismissed as an intangible and futuristic goal. But it’s not — it’s happening right now. And, it's being supercharged through some healthy blockchain competition.

A Fresh Look At Bitcoin Volatility,"Summary Bitcoin began its journey as an esoteric whitepaper published in the hinterlands of the World Wide Web in 2008. Bitcoin’s relative volatility rankings had higher peaks compared to the crash triggered by COVID-19 but similar ranges for the most part. With mainstream adoption of Bitcoin increasing alongside further regulations, the perception of its volatility will continue to evolve. Perception does not always match reality. We suspected this may be the case when it comes to the widely held belief that Bitcoin is considerably more volatile than other asset classes. We tested our theory by revisiting Mieszko Mazur’s 2022 paper, “ Misperceptions of Bitcoin Volatility .” In this blog post, we will discuss Mazur’s methodology, refresh his data, and illustrate why it’s best to approach the topic of Bitcoin volatility analytically and with an open mind. The Beginning Bitcoin began its journey as an esoteric whitepaper published in the hinterlands of the World Wide Web in 2008. As of mid-2024, however, its market capitalization sits at an impressive ~$1.3 trillion, and it is now the “poster child” of digital assets. The specter of Bitcoin’s volatility from its early days looms large and is omnipresent in any discussion about its status as a currency or its intrinsic value. Vanguard CEO Tim Buckley recently dismissed the potential for including the cryptoasset in long-term portfolios, saying that Bitcoin is too volatile . Does his perception match reality? Mazur’s Findings Mazur’s study focused on the months preceding, during, and after the March 2020 stock market crash triggered by the COVID-19 crisis (e.g., the market crash period). His key aim was to discern Bitcoin’s comparative resilience and price behavior surrounding a market crash period. He focused on three indicators: relative ranking of daily realized volatility, daily realized volatility and range-based realized volatility. Here’s what he found: Relative Ranking of Daily Realized Volatility Bitcoin’s return fluctuations were lower than roughly 900 stocks in the S&P 1500 and 190 stocks in the S&P 500 during the months preceding, during, and after the March 2020 stock market crash. During the market crash period, Bitcoin was less volatile than assets like oil, EU carbon credits, and select bonds. Daily Realized Volatility Over the past decade, there has been a significant decline in Bitcoin’s daily realized volatility. Range-Based Realized Volatility Bitcoin’s range-based realized volatility of Bitcoin was significantly higher than the standard measure, using daily returns. Its range-based realized volatility was lower than a long list of S&P 1500 constituents during the market crash period. Do these conclusions carry over to the present day? Our Methodology We analyzed data from late 2020 to early 2024. For practical reasons, our data sources for certain assets diverged from those used in the original study, and we chose to emphasize standardized percentile rankings for ease of interpretation. We examined the same three indicators, however: relative ranking of daily realized volatility 1 , daily realized volatility 2 , and range-based realized volatility 3 . In addition, for carbon credits, we used an ETF proxy ( KRBN ) instead of the EU carbon credits Mazur used in his study. BTC/USD was the currency pair analyzed. Relative Daily Realized Volatility: An Updated View In Exhibit 1 , higher percentiles denote greater volatility with respect to the constituents of the S&P 1500. From November 2020 to February 2024, Bitcoin’s daily realized volatility rank equated to the ~80th percentile relative to the S&P 1500 on average. Exhibit 1. Bitcoin’s Daily Realized Volatility Percentile Rank vs. S&P 1500 Sources and Notes: EODHD; gray areas represent Market Shocks and higher percentile = higher volatility. For subsequent market crises, Bitcoin’s relative volatility rankings had higher peaks compared to the crash triggered by COVID-19 but similar ranges for the most part. Notably, as depicted in Exhibit 2 , in May 2020 and December 2022, Bitcoin was less volatile than the median S&P 1500 stock. Exhibit 2. Bitcoin’s Daily Realized Volatility Across Market Shocks Sources & Notes: Mazur (2022) and EODHD; the COVID-19 Crash ranks and daily realized volatility are derived directly from the original study. Rank of 1 = highest volatility value; percentiles are inverted such that higher percentiles = higher volatility value. Exhibit 3 shows that Bitcoin exhibited the highest volatility compared to all other selected assets during the listed market shocks with some exceptions, such as oil and carbon credits, during the commencement of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Exhibit 3. Bitcoin’s Daily Realized Volatility vs. Other Assets Across Market Shocks Sources and Notes: EODHD, FRED, S&P Global, Tullet Prebon, and Yahoo! Finance; numbers are the maximum daily realized volatilities for the indicated time period. Absolute Daily Realized Volatility: An Updated View True to Mazur’s findings, Bitcoin’s volatility continued to trend downward and experienced progressively lower peaks. Between 2017 and 2020, there were several episodes of spikes that surpassed annualized volatility of 100%. Data from 2021 onward painted a different picture. 2021 peak: 6.1% (97.3% annualized) in May. 2022 peak: 5.5% (87.9% annualized) in June. 2023 peak: 4.1% (65.7% annualized) in March. Exhibit 4. Daily Realized Volatility over Time Source: EODHD. Range-Based Realized Volatility: An Updated View Consistent with Mazur’s findings, range-based realized volatility was 1.74% higher than daily realized volatility, though this was not entirely surprising given our chosen calculation. Bitcoin’s range-based realized volatility was in the ~79 th percentile relative to the S&P 1500 on average. What is interesting, however, is that range-based realized volatility has not experienced a proportionate reduction in extreme peaks over recent years. The notably higher levels of range-based compared to daily close-over-close realized volatility, combined with media coverage that emphasizes inter-day movements over longer time horizons, suggest that this discrepancy is a primary factor contributing to the perception that Bitcoin is highly volatile. Exhibit 5. Range-Based Realized Volatility over Time and Percentile Ranking Relative to S&P 1500 Source: EODHD. Note: Rank of 1 = highest volatility value; percentiles are inverted such that higher percentiles = higher volatility value. Findings Of all of Mazur’s conclusions, the finding pertaining to Bitcoin’s relative daily realized volatility did not hold up in our analysis because its performance relative to other asset classes during market shocks degraded. Conversely, most of Mazur’s findings, including daily- and range-based realized volatility of Bitcoin, still hold true. Relative Ranking of Volatility: Diminished in Strength With respect to the market shocks that followed the COVID-19 crash analyzed in the study, Bitcoin’s daily realized volatility percentile rankings were comparable to the S&P 1500. However, Bitcoin’s daily realized volatility was greater than almost all selected asset classes and showed the highest daily volatility during market shocks, except for oil and carbon credits during the Russia-Ukraine war. Daily Realized Volatility Over Time: Reinforced Consistent with Mazur’s findings, we found that a longer time horizon helps us reduce “cherry-picking.” As such, Bitcoin’s daily realized volatility has shown a gradual yet clear decline over time, with lower peaks observed over the past few years. Range-Based Realized Volatility: Reinforced On average, monthly range-based realized volatility has been 1.74% higher than daily realized volatility since November 2020. Bitcoin’s range-based realized volatility was still lower than a few hundred names from the S&P 1500 on an average monthly basis. Key Takeaways Our update of Mazur’s study found that Bitcoin is not as volatile as perceived. This was evidenced by its percentile rankings compared to the constituents of the S&P 1500, the disparity between its daily realized and range-based realized volatility, and the gradual decline of its daily realized volatility over time. With mainstream adoption of Bitcoin increasing alongside further regulations, the perception of its volatility will continue to evolve. This review of Mazur’s research underscores the importance of approaching this topic analytically and with an open mind. Perceptions do not always match reality. Footnotes To analyze relative resilience during a crisis period, we resumed from Mazur’s late 2020 endpoint, continued into early 2024, and identified three “market shocks” that have occurred: (1) the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine conflict; (2) the US Banking Crisis; and (3) the FTX crash. For daily realized volatility, consistent with the original paper, these figures refer to the maximum average standard deviation of overlapping returns rolled over 21 trading days (equivalent to 30 calendar days/one month), with equal weighting applied. The figures presented represent the maximum rolling value achieved during a calendar month. For Treasuries and corporate bonds, volatility is measured using the standard deviation of overlapping yields rather than returns. To analyze range-based volatility, we opted for a normalized maximum rolling 21-day Average True Range that takes place during a calendar month instead of the range-based method from Goetzmann and Massa (2008) cited in the paper because of the comprehensive information it utilizes. Our method captures the maximum among the current day’s range, the absolute difference between the current day’s high and prior day’s close, and the absolute difference between the current day’s low and prior day’s close. The 21-day ATR is normalized by dividing it by the close price on the last day of the rolling window. While Bitcoin trades continuously, exchanges set cut-off times each day for the necessary “high,” “low,” and “close” inputs needed to calculate the estimator.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4699069-still-misperceived-fresh-look-at-bitcoin-volatility?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/29422270.jpeg

42417919,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTc2Xt,1718283600,Consensys Helps Decentralize Hollywood With Film.io and VillageDAO Partnership,"Film.io aims to bring filmmakers and fans closer to the creative process by forming blockchain-based communities.  Launched in 2022 by Consensys, VillageDAO harnesses the power of Web3 communities to provide customer support and service to dApp users and developers.  Ethereum developer Consensys has announced that Film.io, a startup that uses crypto power to democratize the Hollywood studio system, will be the first partner to join VillageDAO, a smart contract framework and service provider for Web3 communities, formed within ConsenSys back in 2022.  Ethereum brings together a vast ecosystem these days, and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) have had the power to ignite that community and drive various projects and fundraising ideas of all sorts.  A clear target for some degree of decentralization, the Hollywood studio system is a highly evolved series of gatekeeping intermediaries and the result is a world where storytelling and creativity is systematically stifled, points out Bryan Hertz, co-creator of Film.io.  “Film.io is a decentralized community that filmmakers can build around their own film project and really choose their own path,” said Hertz in an interview. “They can seek funding, distribution, as well as assistance from the community in developing their project, whether it's improving the idea or even getting assets recreated, like movie posters or things like that, doing it In a decentralized way.”  From a Film.io perspective, Hertz said he sees film projects with budgets ranging from half a million dollars to $30 million-plus, which he expects to increase as more studios come on board the platform.  VillageDAO, originally incubated within Consensys back in 2022 and now planning a life of its own, can offer a brand like Film.io a better managed environment than the likes of Discord, said Consensys managing director Dror Avieli.  “Discord is a great tool to some degree, but it can quite quickly become a kind of Wild West where you encounter many different levels of behavior and quite a bit of chaos,” said Avieli in an interview. “We believe in creating an environment with better technology, better procedures and better funding, and overall better community management and support.”  As VillageDAO’s first official partner, Film.io will have a designated white-label portal on the  VillageDAO platform: The Film.io Village. To kick off the partnership, Film.io, and VillageDAO are rolling out a “Community Expert'' certification program that allows Film.io members to support the existing community and assist in onboarding new users, the companies said.",POSITIVE,없음,TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/06/13/consensys-helps-decentralize-hollywood-with-filmio-and-villagedao-partnership,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6c3b8738f364dba5d8d51098be32e7b21bd186b5-2016x1512.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

29420942,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=624411,1718281853,"Dogecoin Under Pressure And ‘Going To Zero’, Analyst Says – Here’s Why","The beloved Dogecoin, the Shiba Inu-faced cryptocurrency that started as a joke, is facing a ruff time. A recent $16 million sell-off by a large holder, likely a “whale” investor, has sent shockwaves through the DOGE community, raising questions about the meme coin’s long-term viability. Related Reading: Bitcoin Ownership Trends: Short-Term Spike As ETFs Gain Popularity – Report Mags Charts A Worrying Course Crypto analyst Mags has emerged as the harbinger of doom for DOGE. Using a self-developed charting method, Mags identifies distinct phases in Dogecoin’s historical price movements. Phase 3, according to Mags, paints a particularly bleak picture, suggesting a potential plummet to zero. Bluntly, the analyst says the meme coin is “bearish” and is about to become worthless. $DOGE is bearish and is going to zero. don’t belive me? see for yourself 👇 pic.twitter.com/p4jYYDlbLZ — Mags (@thescalpingpro) June 12, 2024 This prediction hinges on the cyclical nature of DOGE, where brief price surges are followed by extended periods of decline. While a temporary spike to $1.70 is possible in Phase 3, Mags warns investors to be wary of such fleeting optimism. Technical Indicators Flash Red Despite a recent 4% price increase, technical indicators paint a concerning picture. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits squarely in neutral territory, neither overbought nor oversold, reflecting investor indecision. More importantly, DOGE is currently trading below its key moving averages, with the 200-day EMA acting as the last line of defense at $0.123. A breach of this support level could trigger a domino effect, sending DOGE tumbling further towards the $0.07 mark. Can Dogecoin Defy The Odds? While Mags’ analysis and technical indicators cast a long shadow, there’s still a glimmer of hope for the meme coin. The recent uptick in trading volume suggests heightened activity, potentially indicating a buying spree by loyal DOGE holders. Additionally, overcoming the first resistance level of $0.14 could signal a potential turnaround. However, this optimistic scenario hinges on defying historical trends and requires a significant shift in market sentiment. The future of Dogecoin remains shrouded in uncertainty. Elon Musk, the self-proclaimed “Dogefather” and a major influencer of the meme coin’s price, has been relatively quiet recently. Without his usual bullish tweets, DOGE lacks a strong catalyst for a sustained push upwards. Related Reading: Ethereum Longs Crushed! Who Got Burned In The $62 Million Fire Sale? Dogecoin Price Forecast Meanwhile, based on technical analysis by CoinCodex, the price of Dogecoin is predicted to decrease by 13%, reaching $0.12by July 13, 2024. The current sentiment is Bearish, suggesting a prevailing expectation of downward price movement. Despite this, the Fear & Greed Index stands at 70, indicating a high level of Greed among investors. Over the past 30 days, Dogecoin has experienced 14 out of 30 green days, equating to a 47% success rate in positive price movements. The observed price volatility during this period is 5.10%, indicating significant fluctuations in its market price. This heightened volatility, combined with the bearish sentiment, suggests that Dogecoin may encounter further price declines, although investor optimism as indicated by the Fear & Greed Index could introduce short-term price rallies.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin held its ground above $67,000 during the European morning following the Fed's hawkish interest rate projections on Wednesday. The U.S. central bank left rates unchanged on Wednesday and predicted just one reduction this year, which sent bitcoin lower. Following a dip toward $67,000 during the Asian morning, BTC ticked back upward swiftly before trading between $67,200-$67,800. At time of writing, bitcoin is sitting above $67,900, up 0.16% 24 hours ago. The CoinDesk CD 20, meanwhile, is down 0.34% in that time. Ether has fluctuated either side of $3,500, currently 1.1% down in the last 24 hours.  Paxos has laid off 65 people, amounting 20% off its staff, according to a report by Bloomberg. CEO Charles Cascarilla said that the layoffs “allows us to best execute on the massive opportunity ahead in tokenization and stablecoin"" and the company is in a ""very strong financial position to succeed."" Paxos intends to gradually discontinue its settlement services in commodities and securities. Instead, it will concentrate more on asset tokenization and stablecoins, Bloomberg reported. Paxos has a balance sheet of around $500 million, according to disclosures from its various stablecoins. However, the company took a hit last year when the New York Department of Financial Services forced it to stop minting Binance's BUSD in early 2023, which had a market cap of $16 billion at its peak.  Curve’s CRV token plunged 30% in early Asian trading hours as some loan positions supposedly tied to its founder, Michael Egorov, started to automatically liquidate, leading to sudden selling activity. Data tracked by Lookonchain and Arkham show Egorov’s addresses have taken out a cumulative loan of nearly $100 million worth of stablecoins, mostly crvUSD, against $140 million in CRV collateral. A Debank profile tracking Egorov’s wallet shows he has borrowed from Inverse, UwU Lend, Fraxlend, and Curve’s LlamaLend using CRV tokens as collateral. Total holdings across tracked wallets are down 50% in the past 24 hours. In the early Asian hours, several loans were repaid on Inverse and Llamalend with FRAX, DOLA, and CRV tokens.

29419056,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=624406,1718278227,"Toncoin (TON) Set For 40% Breakout: Buy At This Price, Says Crypto Analyst","In a technical analysis, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has identified a potential 40% breakout for Toncoin (TON), targeting an ambitious price point of $11. Martinez’s analysis, delivered through detailed chart reviews published on X, provides a robust case for TON’s impending price movement, underpinned by classical chart patterns and Fibonacci retracement levels. Toncoin Is on The Verge Of A Major Breakout Martinez’s first chart showcases TON/USDT plotted on a 12-hour timeframe, demonstrating a classic ascending triangle pattern. This pattern is recognized in technical analysis as a bullish signal, particularly when it forms during an uptrend as is evident with TON. An ascending triangle is characterized by a flat upper resistance line—here, at approximately $7.54—and a rising lower trendline that sequentially creates higher lows. The convergence of these lines indicates dwindling supply and increasing demand, suggesting that a breakout is likely as the price compresses. Related Reading: Toncoin (TON) Flips Ethereum In Daily Active Users, Fueling $10 Price Target Predictions The target price of $11, which implies a 40% increase from the triangle’s resistance line, is derived using the measured move method. This method calculates the breakout target by adding the widest point of the triangle to the breakout point. In TON’s case, the widest part of the triangle spans approximately $3.07 (40.03%), projecting from the breakout resistance could ideally set the price near $11. Martinez extends his analysis on a separate 4-hour chart of TON’s performance in a Tether (USDT) perpetual contract on Binance. This chart employs Fibonacci retracement levels to further refine the support and resistance thresholds. The Fibonacci levels, drawn from recent highs and lows, reveal crucial supports at $7.44 (23.6% retracement), $7.30 (38.2% retracement), $7.1912 (50% retracement) and $6.9220 (78.6% retracement). Related Reading: Toncoin (TON) Faces Price Fatigue, Possible Drawdown Ahead – Analyst Compounding the technical narrative, the TD Sequential indicator—an advanced tool used to predict price reversals—points to a potential short-term pullback. Martinez notes this indicator suggests that TON might dip to around $7.2, aligning with the 23.6% Fibonacci level, before making the significant bullish leap. This dip is interpreted as a strategic entry point for investors, providing a lower risk buying opportunity before the anticipated breakout. “Toncoin is gearing up for a potential 40% breakout, aiming for $11! However, the TD Sequential indicator suggests TON might briefly dip to $7.2 to gather liquidity before the upswing,” Martinez noted via X. For traders and investors, understanding the strategic significance of the $7.2 entry point is crucial. This level not only represents mid-point of the retracement but also serves as a psychological support zone, where the market might consolidate gains before accumulating enough momentum for the potential breakout. At press time, Toncoin traded $7.59.

42417916,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTc2Vp,1718276812,"Australia's Treasury to Include Stablecoin Rules in Crypto Bill Draft, ASIC's Warning For Crypto Entities","Australia's regulators are looking to include stablecoin legislation into its legislative bill for the digital assets sector.  A representative of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission said they had held meetings with regulators like the SEC about their legal positions on crypto.  Australia's regulators have provided rare updates on their plans for the digital assets sector, including plans to introduce a draft framework for stablecoins and hinted that more enforcement is on its way against unlicensed entities during an event in Sydney on Wednesday.  The event, Digital Assets: Anchoring the Digital Economy, was hosted by Blockchain Australia, the nation's policy body for the industry.  Australia's Treasury previously announced plans to release draft legislation to cover licensing and custody rules for crypto asset providers by the end of 2024. Now, that draft could include a framework to regulate stablecoins.  ""The digital asset platform reforms have been allocated a drafting spot with The Office of Parliamentary Counsel (responsible for drafting and publishing Australian laws) that would see the exposure draft released before the end of this year,"" said Chris Adamek, director of the Australian Treasury's digital asset policy unit.  ""Within that drafting slot, there are various reforms and each has a different priority to the payments reforms, which would include our proposed framework for regulating stablecoins sit within that same slot, and they'll be sort of done one after the other. Given that overlap, reps (representatives) are hoping that both of them will be released at the same time.""  The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) said it was assisting the government in providing advice to colleagues in the Treasury and that it was having regular meetings with peers across the world including the EU, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, and North America to understand more about the cases they have filed against digital asset firms.  ""We are actively monitoring cases overseas and interacting regularly with our overseas peers,"" said Dr Rhys Bollen, senior executive leader of digital assets at ASIC. ""We had an hour on the phone with the SEC this morning talking about some of the work that they're doing and what we can learn from that. We have run half a dozen (cases) already that interact with the digital assets and crypto assets base and we do have more.""  Additionally, ASIC's representative said it has and will provide guidance but it is also subject to the law, warning crypto entities to fall in line with the precedents set in the recent cases it has filed against crypto entities in front of an audience of industry goers.  ""When did you last review the tokens that you list on your platform? When was the last time you reviewed the products and services that you are making available? How recently have you consulted with your lawyers about where the law currently sees the most current understanding based on cases over the last six months or so. If you haven't done that in the last four months you need to consider where you are,"" Bollen said.  Bollen also said ASIC would be appealing recent judgements that, at least in part, were in favor of crypto entities such as Block Earner and BPS Financial Pty Ltd (BPS). In recent times, ASIC has sued Binance Australia and social investing platform eToro, while major banks of the nation have imposed partial restrictions on crypto citing scams.  Blockchain Australia has now rebranded to become the Digital Economy Council of Australia (DECA) and will include a membership category for banks.

42417920,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTc2Yv,1718272772,"ERCOT CEO: Texas' Power Grid Needs Larger Increase Than Expected to Handle AI, Bitcoin Mining","Texas recently revised estimates of how much capacity its grid will need, citing demand from AI and bitcoin mining.  The political climate towards these two industries is souring because of increased energy demands, while Trump is doubling down on his support for mining.  Texas' grid will soon need to dramatically expand to meet growing demand from bitcoin miners and artificial intelligence data centers, while the political climate towards both these industries may be souring.  Speaking to the Texas Senate Business and Commerce Committee Wednesday, Pablo Vegas, the CEO of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which manages the state's power grid, said that demand from these two industries is testing the grid forcing officials to revise estimates for how much energy it will need to produce by the end of the next decade.  “We're trying to put together a puzzle that kind of illuminates how this market can work for the next five to ten to fifteen years,"" Vegas is quoted by local media as saying.  Vegas said that within the next six years capacity needs to grow from 85,000 megawatts to 150,000 megawatts. Initially the expectation was that the grid only needed 130,000 megawatts in this time frame.  Bitcoin mining and AI data centers will be responsible for more than half of the added growth on the Texas grid, he said. Data centers for AI workloads use significantly more power than their peers because of the intensity of the workload.  Research from Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam projects that AI could be responsible for as much electricity consumption as bitcoin in just a few years.  All this comes as political climate towards bitcoin and AI's power consumption is souring.  State Sen. Jose Menendez (D-San Antonio) said during the testimony that it was ""inherently unjust"" mining operations and AI data centers could move to the state to take advantage of its low cost of energy while everyday Texans were ""making tough decisions about costs"".  In a post on X, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick wrote that these two industries ""produce very few jobs compared to the incredible demands they place on our grid"" and that the Texas Senate would be taking a closer look.  ""I’m more interested in building the grid to service customers in their homes, apartments, and normal businesses and keeping costs as low as possible for them instead of for very niche industries that have massive power demands and produce few jobs,"" he wrote. ""We want data centers, but it can’t be the Wild Wild West of data centers and crypto miners crashing our grid and turning the lights off.""  In December 2022, the Canadian province of British Columbia enacted an 18-month moratorium on new crypto mining operations citing the low number of jobs they create compared to the high energy demand. A provincial court upheld that ban earlier this year (the moritorium is scheduled to expire by the end of July).  All this comes as Republican front runner Donald Trump doubles down on his support for the bitcoin mining industry.  ""Bitcoin mining may be our last line of defense against a CBDC. Biden’s hatred of Bitcoin only helps China, Russia, and the Radical Communist Left. We want all the remaining Bitcoin to be MADE IN THE USA!!!

A recent report by Bitfinex Alpha reveals a fascinating dichotomy in investor behavior, with new players chasing quick profits and seasoned hodlers (hold on for dear life) accumulating for the long haul. Related Reading: Ethereum Longs Crushed! Who Got Burned In The $62 Million Fire Sale? Short-Term Surge Fueled By ETF Frenzy Spot Bitcoin ETFs, financial instruments that mirror Bitcoin’s price, have emerged as a game-changer. These easily accessible options are attracting a new breed of investor, one with a keen eye for short-term gains. This influx is evident in the significant rise of short-term holders (those holding Bitcoin for less than 155 days). Their holdings have skyrocketed by nearly 55% since January, indicating a surge in speculative activity. It looks like we still have overhang from last cycle.

We… pic.twitter.com/VxaXozgANT — Thomas | heyapollo.com (@thomas_fahrer) June 12, 2024 However, this newfound enthusiasm comes with a caveat. Short-term investors, by their very nature, tend to be more reactive to price fluctuations. A sudden market correction could trigger a sell-off, causing price volatility. The report highlights this vulnerability, emphasizing the need for caution amidst the current “greed” sentiment in the market (as measured by the Fear & Greed Index). Long-Term Holders: Diamonds In The Rough While the short-term scene buzzes with activity, long-term holders continue to display unwavering faith in Bitcoin’s potential. These digital veterans, who weathered previous market cycles, have shown a remarkable buying spree after initially offloading some holdings at Bitcoin’s all-time high in March. The report further underscores this bullish sentiment by pointing out the minimal amount of Bitcoin held by long-term investors that was purchased above the current price point. This signifies a “hodling” mentality, where investors are confident that the current price represents a good entry point for future gains. Additionally, Bitcoin whales (large investors holding significant amounts) are mirroring their pre-2020 bull run behavior by aggressively accumulating Bitcoin, indicating a potential repeat of the previous market upswing. Navigating The Crosscurrents The current Bitcoin market presents a unique situation. On one hand, the influx of short-term investors injects fresh energy and liquidity. However, their presence also introduces the risk of increased volatility. On the other hand, long-term holders continue to be the bedrock of the market, providing stability and confidence.

Founder Micheal Egorov has taken a CRV-backed cumulative loan of nearly $100 million, data tracking firms said.  Lending protocol Curve's CRV token plunged Thursday as loans tied to company founder Michael Egorov automatically liquidated, leading to a burst of selling.  Data tracked by blockchain analytics firms Lookonchain and Arkham show Egorov's addresses have taken out a cumulative loan of nearly $100 million worth of stablecoins, mostly crvUSD, against $140 million in CRV collateral.  Hours after the sudden move in prices, which took CRV's token price down 30% at one point, Egorov acknowledged on X that his positions were liquidated. ""I have already repaid 93%, and I intend to repay the rest very shortly. It will help users not to suffer from this situation,"" he said.  A Debank profile tracking Egorov's wallet shows he has borrowed from Inverse, UwU Lend, Fraxlend and Curve's LlamaLend using CRV tokens as collateral. Total holdings across tracked wallets are down 50% in the past 24 hours.  Wallet transactions show Egorov actively taking steps to mitigate risks. In the early Asian hours, several loans were repaid on Inverse and Llamalend with FRAX, DOLA and CRV tokens. Some of the addresses also conducted several swaps between CRV and Tether's USDT, the data shows.  The liquidation of such a large position started to put pressure on other DeFi protocols as CRV is used as a trading pair and ballast in trading pools across the ecosystem.  One address on Frax Lend, a different lending and borrowing protocol, saw $3.3 million in liquidated positions as CRV prices fell.  This is the second time Egorov's borrowed positions have created ripples in the crypto market. In 2023, an exploit of several Curve lending pools caused CRV prices to suddenly dump – putting over $100 million at risk of being liquidated.  At the time, DeFi bigwigs such as Tron founder Justin Sun stepped in to supply liquidity and prevent bad debt, acquiring millions in CRV at a discount to prevent the risk of collateral damage across the crypto ecosystem.

29413090,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=624356,1718268320,"Bitcoin Price’s Path To $300,000 Cleared By Massive Bullish Pattern, Says Analyst","According to an analysis shared by renowned crypto analyst Gert van Lagen, the Bitcoin price chart has illustrated a significant technical pattern in the 3-day chart (BTC/USD) that could potentially signal an upsurge to as high as $300,000. Known as the “Cup with Handle,” this pattern is celebrated among traders for its predictive reliability and bullish implications. Unpacking The Massive Bitcoin Cup And Handle Pattern The Cup with Handle is a bullish continuation pattern that resembles a teacup on a chart. This pattern is formed when the price initially drops and then rises to form a rounded bottom—the “cup”—followed by a smaller downward move—the “handle”—before resuming its upward trajectory. The Cup: This segment of the pattern represents a period of consolidation and recovery. It typically starts with a high price point, gradually descends to a rounded, U-shaped trough, and ascends back to the initial high. In the case of Bitcoin, the cup formation began in November 2021 when the price reached its cycle high at $69,000 and ended in March 2024 after reclaiming the old all-time high, indicating the end of a long-term consolidation phase. Related Reading: Is The Crypto Surge Over? Bitcoin Stalls At $72,000 As Investor Enthusiasm Wanes The Handle: Following the cup, a slight downward drift forms the handle, which is smaller in depth and duration compared to the cup. It usually represents a final consolidation or a shakeout of less bullish investors before a significant breakout. Bitcoin’s handle formed over the last several months, showing a tighter price range and lower volatility. Upon the completion of the handle, the prevailing bullish sentiment and buying pressure often drive the price above the previous resistance level—formed by the rim of the cup. This breakout is critical as it confirms the pattern and sets the stage for future price gains. The target price following a Cup with Handle breakout can be projected by measuring the depth of the cup and extrapolating this distance upwards from the point of breakout. For Bitcoin, the lowest point of the cup at roughly $15,500 relative to the initial high at $69,000 provides a vertical measure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is ‘Still Significantly Undervalued,’ Says Finance Guru Bill Miller IV Via X, Gert van Lagen stated: “BTC [3D] – Cup with Handle targeting $300k. Price has broken out of the handle / bull flag and retested it successfully for about four weeks already.” Perspectives From Other Analysts Crypto analyst Nunya Bizniz has critiqued the analysis by pointing out the differences in outcomes based on whether measurements are taken on a logarithmic or a linear scale. According to Bizniz, a linear projection suggests a target near $121,947, while a logarithmic projection might see the price ascend to approximately $309,295. Measured move targets on a log chart? pic.twitter.com/xiIfBGK8tR — Nunya Bizniz (@Pladizow) June 13, 2024 Jonathan Hobbs, CFA, added a cautious note to the discussion, suggesting that projections at the upper end of these scales tend to attract significant attention and can influence market sentiment disproportionately. “Looks like we’re at the stage of the bull market where posting about the highest possible Bitcoin targets drives the most engagement,” he stated.

29410816,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=624361,1718264695,Ethereum Longs Crushed! Who Got Burned In The $62 Million Fire Sale?,"Ethereum (ETH) bulls got a taste of fire on June 11th as the altcoin’s derivatives market witnessed a dramatic surge in long liquidations. According to data from Coinglass, this event marked the highest level of long liquidations since May 23rd, signifying a significant correction for traders who bet on rising prices. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Loses 14% In Last 7 Days – Will The Misery Worsen? Crimson Chart: Long Positions Liquidated Overconfident investors piled into long positions, essentially placing a wager that Ethereum’s price would climb. However, the market had other plans. An unexpected price drop sent shivers down the spines of these bulls, triggering a wave of liquidations. As the price dipped below a certain threshold set by the exchange (known as the margin requirement), these positions were forcefully closed to prevent further losses for the unfortunate traders. The result? A collective sigh of relief for some exchanges, but a hefty bill for liquidated bulls, totaling over $60 million on that fateful day. Positive Funding Rate Offers A Glimmer Of Hope While the market correction sent shockwaves through the Ethereum derivatives landscape, a silver lining emerged in the form of a positive Funding Rate. This metric essentially reflects the fees paid by traders holding short positions (betting on a price decline) to those holding long positions. In simpler terms, a positive Funding Rate indicates a stronger demand for long positions, suggesting that even amidst the carnage, some investors remain optimistic about Ethereum’s long-term prospects. This positivity is further bolstered by the fact that ETH’s Funding Rate hasn’t dipped into negative territory since May 3rd. A Temporary Hiccup? The jury’s still out on whether this event represents a fleeting blip or a more concerning trend. While the positive Funding Rate offers a glimmer of hope, the significant drop in derivatives activity paints a different picture. The past 24 hours have seen a worrying decline in both options trading volume (down 50%) and Open Interest (total outstanding contracts, down 2%). This suggests a potential flight from the market, with fewer participants actively trading options contracts or holding open positions. Ether Price Forecast Meanwhile, the current Ethereum price prediction by CoinCodex suggests a 2.46% rise to $3,636 by July 13, 2024. Despite this positive outlook, the market sentiment remains bearish. The Fear & Greed Index stands at 70 (Greed), indicating strong investor interest.

The Fed will eventually signal more rate cuts, the research firm added.  ETF inflows resumed Wednesday as U.S. inflation came in lower-than-expected.  10x Research continues to advocate bitcoin even as the leading cryptocurrency trades under pressure following the Fed's hawkish interest rate projections.  On Wednesday, the U.S. central bank left the benchmark borrowing cost unchanged in the range of 5.25%- 5.5% as expected. However, it predicted just one rate reduction this year, down from three in March. Given the softer-than-expected CPI release early in the day, the Fed's new rate prediction likely spooked markets, sending bitcoin lower.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value has pulled back to $67,400 since the Fed released rate projections, reversing the post-CPI jump to $70,000, CoinDesk data show.  Still, 10x Research maintains a positive outlook on bitcoin, expressing confidence that the rally will soon resume.  ""Our recommendation remains unchanged: to stick with the winners (Bitcoin) and avoid others (such as Ethereum). Our previous analysis has shown that a lower CPI number tends to lift Bitcoin prices, and we anticipate this trend will continue,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said in a note to clients on Thursday.  The U.S. consumer price inflation rate was flat in May, missing the consensus estimate for a 0.1% rise and down from 0.3% in April. The year-on-year rate was 3.3%, matching estimates and down from April's 3.4%.  Per Thielen, the slowdown in inflation has historically attracted huge inflows into the U.S.-listed spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Provisional data from Farside Investors show the ETFs amassed $100 million on Wednesday, snapping a two-days outflows streak.  Thielen explained that the ETF flows dried after the debut on Jan. 11 as December CPI came in higher, weakening the case for Fed rate cuts. The flows resumed in February, pushing bitcoin higher.  ""ETF flows turned positive at the end of January but only started to accelerate slightly ahead of the CPI data release on February 13. But when inflation again increased to 3.2% on March 12, Bitcoin ETF inflows stopped as the market priced out the narrative of 2-3 rate cuts,"" Thielen noted at the end of May.  Thielen expects the Fed to signal more rate cuts later this year as inflation has already peaked.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/06/13/stick-with-bitcoin-avoid-ether-10x-research-says-after-fed-predicts-just-one-rate-cut-for-2024,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/71c311d4683d99f9e501e8dee8cf02d9489295d9-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Among the notable winners is io.net’s native token IO, which surged above the $5 mark and saw a substantial 50% increase within hours of a major listing announcement. What Drives Investor Interest In io.net? The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, revealed that io.net would be added to various platforms, including Binance Simple Earn, Binance Convert, Binance Margin, Binance Futures, and Binance Auto-Invest. Related Reading: Bullish News: Top Analyst Forecasts Altcoin Bottom Today, Market Poised For Upswing – Here’s Why This listing news sent IO to a record high of $5.99, making it one of the top gainers among Solana-based tokens. However, the recent surge in IO’s price and investor interest begs the question: What is io.net, and why are investors flocking to this token? At its core, io.net aims to establish a globally accessible and decentralized cloud computing network. This network reportedly provides affordable, flexible, and permissionless access to compute capacity, specifically targeting the increasing demand for GPU power driven by the rapid growth of AI applications. One of the main propositions of io.net lies in addressing the challenges faced by traditional cloud computing infrastructure, including high costs, limited availability, and long wait times. io.net tackles these issues by aggregating GPUs from underutilized sources such as independent data centers and idle crypto mining farms. By leveraging these resources, io.net offers computing power at significantly reduced costs—up to 90% less than centralized providers. IO Token Sales And Economics io.net leverages distributed computing libraries to facilitate parallel training. Training models on a single device often leads to bottlenecks due to CPU/GPU memory limitations. However, io.net overcomes this challenge by orchestrating and batch-training jobs across multiple devices, using data and model parallelism to improve training efficiency. Additionally, io.net supports reinforcement learning (RL) workloads by employing an open-source RL library. This feature easily enables the development and deployment of complex RL models, utilizing a simple set of application programming interfaces (APIs). Regarding token sales and economics, io.net has a strategy to ensure the steady and controlled distribution of tokens, promoting long-term stability and growth of the ecosystem. The initial circulating supply upon listing on Binance is 95,000,000 IO tokens, accounting for 19.00% of the Genesis supply. The maximum token supply is 800,000,000 IO tokens, with allocations for private sales, public launch, team and advisors, and ecosystem treasury. Solana-Based Tokens Performance When writing, the Solana-based token IO is trading at $5.67. It remains to be seen if the current uptrend will be sustained over time after the initial hype surrounding the Binance listing. Notably, the token has quickly reached a market capitalization of $543 million, indicating a significant influx of investment into the newly launched IO token. Related Reading: Ex-Ripple Director Explains XRP Price Slide Amid Good News Alongside IO, another Solana-based token, dogwifhat (WIF), has also experienced a recovery after a sharp correction in the past week. WIF has regained the $2.68 level and recorded a 6% uptrend in the last 24 hours. In the case of Solana itself, the cryptocurrency is currently trading at $156, reflecting a 5.5% increase within the 24-hour timeframe. However, the fifth largest cryptocurrency in market capitalization, over $72 billion, has experienced a price decline of nearly 10% over the past seven days.

One crypto analyst, in particular, who gets by @Av_Sebastian on X (formerly Twitter), believes that the Cardano price can rise as high as $2, crediting the upcoming Chang upgrade as the reason for this. Cardano Will Reach $2 Soon In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the crypto analyst revealed their expectation for the Cardano price, saying it could rally more than 300% from here. Sebastian explained that the reason for this is the upcoming Cardano hard fork that has sparked excitement in the community. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crash Below $67,000 Sends Market Spiraling, Here Are The Levels To Watch The crypto analyst refers to previous Cardano network upgrades, all of which have sent the ADA price rallying in response. One notable example of the ADA price rallying in response to a network upgrade is the excitement surrounding the Alonzo hard fork in 2021. The Alonzo hard fork was important because it introduced smart contracts capabilities on the network. This meant that the budding decentralized finance (DeFi) sector would eventually debut on the Cardano network, bringing a new wave of users to the blockchain. In the months leading up to the Alonzo hard fork, the ADA price went from $0.2 to a new all-time high of $3.1, rallying over 30x in the space of a year. Going by this, Sebastian expects that the ADA price could put on a similar rally. According to Sebastian, the Chang upgrade, which will see all nodes updated by August, will be the major driver behind this. As a result, he expects that ADA will rise 370% to $2 and the timeline for this is placed for August, which is only two months away. So, in June the Cardano blockchain will receive the node upgrade and in August all nodes should be updated and Chang should be live. Before all other important hard forks, $ADA price went nuts. A $2 $ADA in August is highly likely! — Sssebi🦁 (@Av_Sebastian) June 10, 2024 Chang Upgrade Gains Ground The Cardano Chang upgrade is already gaining ground as investors are looking favorably toward it. The upgrade is expected to help grant users greater control when it comes to the network’s governance. Some of the major changes expected from the upgrade will be an advanced governance system, treasury and annual budgets, as well as better support. Related Reading: Bitcoin Turns Weakness Into Strength: Analyst Identifies Major Liquidity Zone At $73,000 Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson has also commented on the upgrade, saying that it is a major change for ADA. The upgrade will move all Cardano nodes to version 9.0. However, at least 70% of all node operators are required to upgrade to the new version before the upgrade can occur. At this time, the network’s upgrade is expected to happen sometime in August 2024. So far, the ADA price has not shown any significant reaction to the upcoming upgrade. The altcoin continues to trend low at $0.4254 at the time of writing, with a 7.78% decline in the last seven days.

He stated, “Unless we see the ETH ETFs come into play, altcoins will likely continue declining against BTC. However, this period could represent an optimal time for strategic accumulation.” Signs Of Recovery Amid Market Turbulence Despite recent challenges, there are emerging signs of recovery within the crypto market. Following the US CPI’s latest report indicating slowed inflation, Bitcoin experienced a 4.7% increase over the past 24 hours, adjusting its price to $69,573. Adding to the complexity of the market dynamics, a recent analysis by CryptoQuant analyst Abramchart revealed significant Bitcoin acquisitions by whales during recent price dips, suggesting that large investors are actively increasing their holdings. Meanwhile, the broader altcoin market has shown resilience, with the total market capitalization climbing from $1.038 trillion to a 24-hour peak of $1.108 trillion. Leading altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and XRP have posted gains of 5.2%, 8.7%, and 4.7%, respectively. A report by analyst Burakkesmeci pointed to a substantial Ethereum outflow from Coinbase, marking the largest withdrawal this year and hinting at possible large-scale institutional activity. These transactions, often involving sums between $400 million to $1.1 billion, underscore a potentially bullish outlook for Ethereum, especially in anticipation of new developments like the trading of spot ETFs.

Particularly, Raoul Pal, CEO of Real Vision, has highlighted this trend based on data concerning these funds’ ownership and trading patterns.

29393101,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=624264,1718236837,Why Is Bitcoin Stagnant Despite ETF Inflows? Report Answers,"Glassnode has discussed in a new report the reasons behind Bitcoin moving sideways despite inflows into the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Why Bitcoin Has Been Stagnant Despite Spot ETF Inflows In its latest weekly report, the analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the impressive inflows into the US spot ETFs have failed to make the price break its sideways trend. The spot ETFs, which the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved in January of this year, have provided investors with an alternate means of gaining exposure to the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Overheated Right Now? This Metric Suggests No These funds buy and hold Bitcoin on behalf of their users, letting them get indirect exposure to the coin’s price movements without having to own the asset itself. The more traditional investors, who don’t want to attempt to navigate cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets, have found the spot ETFs to be a comfortable investment option. Since their launch, the spot ETFs have brought large demand for the asset. Initially, these fresh capital inflows helped BTC rise to a new all-time high (ATH), but recently, the asset has been consolidated. Below is a chart that shows how the combined reserve of these funds compares against the other large entities in the sector. From the graph, it’s visible that the spot ETFs hold 862,000 BTC. This is more than what the miners (excluding Patoshi) hold (706,000 BTC) but notably less than the reserve of the centralized exchanges (2.3 million BTC). Glassnode has noted that the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase alone holds a big part of the total exchange reserve and the US spot ETF balance through its custody service. “With Coinbase serving both ETF clients and conventional on-chain asset holders, the gravity of the exchange in the market pricing process has become significant,” reads the report. The data for the whale deposits to the platform reveal a rising trend until mid-April. According to the analytics firm, a significant portion of these whale deposits had come from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), adding to the selling pressure in the market. The whale exchange inflows shooting up may partly explain why the spot ETFs haven’t proven as effective. Another factor behind the consolidation can be the trend in the futures market. The chart below shows that the CME’s future open interest has recently been at high levels. The report thinks this could signal that an increasing number of traders have been adopting a cash-and-carry arbitrage strategy. This arbitrage involves a market-neutral position, coupling the purchase of a long spot position, and the sale (short) of a position in a futures contract of the same underlying asset which is trading at a premium.
