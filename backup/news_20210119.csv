42385669,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB5xJf,1611097980,Dan Larimer’s Departure Brings EOS Disappointments to the Fore,"On Jan. 10, leading pro-EOS YouTuber Colin Talks Crypto announced he had sold all his holdings following the revelation earlier that day that Dan Larimer had resigned his position as CTO of Block.one, the company that made the software powering the EOS blockchain.      In fact, Larimer has been gone since the end of the year.      EOS, as of this writing, is the 16th-largest blockchain by market capitalization, according to CoinGecko, right after the privacy coin Monero and right above decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Aave. Its market capitalization took a major hit following the Larimer news, losing about a billion dollars in a day.      Hopes for EOS have in many ways hinged on the actions of Block.one, the company that successfully completed a yearlong initial coin offering (ICO) that raised a record-setting $4 billion. These days, however, Block.one is more explicitly about driving value to its stash of 140,000 BTC (and counting) than its considerable EOS position.      To be fair, Block.one never really promised to do more than provide the underlying software for EOS, and it has continued to do so.      In fact, as EOS has become clogged in recent years, Block.one has released a new way for users to pay for transactions as they go (rather than the original approach of staking EOS for a percentage of network resources), which sounds a lot like Ethereum's approach with gas.      Winding back the clock, Block.one launched EOS in a unique way, probably the most hands-off approach of any significant blockchain since Bitcoin. It wrote the code for the software that runs EOS and then it just published it so that anyone who wanted to kick it off could do so.      As it had given supporters considerable warning around doing this, though, by the time the code was released there was already a global coalition in place running hours-long calls over Google Hangouts to plot the launch of the chain so that one and only one would be viewed as the EOS blockchain.      After fits and starts, the global launch committee finally got the chain running in neutral and then, after another delay, a sufficient number of EOS bagholders cast on-chain votes so that EOS actually started producing blocks on June 14, 2018.      All of this happened at arm's length from Block.one itself. In fact, Block.one did not start participating in EOS governance until last year, despite being the largest single holder of EOS tokens.    Read more: Block.one Plans to Start Voting on EOS, the Blockchain It Birthed    This separation between the software's originator and its administration may help explain why Block.one got off with a light settlement from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Once through that regulatory gauntlet, Block.one has been free to pursue its own ideas about the best use of its considerable capital.      Early EOS backers have always believed that ICO funds entrusted to Block.one would be used to drive value back to the blockchain in order to make EOS tokens more valuable. That has never really happened, however, which has driven frustration by longtime EOS backers.      Many, like Colin Talks Crypto, have moved on.      ""I just sold 100% of my EOS tokens as a result of this news. For me it was the last straw,"" Colin Talks Crypto said in the Jan. 10 video.      The YouTuber is one of the better-known EOS proponents on social media. Besides running multiple social media channels where he discussed cryptocurrency, he also ran an EOS proxy where holders could back his picks for the best block producers (more on these below). Colin Talks Crypto also shut down his proxy following Larimer's departure.    Many stakeholders    Before we go any further, here are a few points of context, because the EOS ecosystem can get confusing.      Block.one is the company that ran the ICO that led to the launch of EOS. The ICO ran on Ethereum and then all of the tokens on Ethereum were ported over to EOS. In mid-2019, Bloomberg reported the company had more than $2 billion in cash and 140,000 BTC. Its backers include early Facebook investor and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel.      Block.one uses its ICO funds by making investments directly and also indirectly, through other funds it has invested in, including Mike Novogratz's Galaxy Digital. Novogratz sold off shares that Galaxy held in Block.one in 2019.      The most confusing point is probably this one: Block.one built EOSIO, the software that runs EOS. EOSIO is not EOS, and other public blockchains also run on EOSIO, such as Telos, Worldwide Asset Exchange (WAX) and others.      Telos was launched as one of the earliest forks of EOS, and Suvi Rinkinen, CEO of the Telos Foundation, confirmed to CoinDesk that Block.one has never invested in her organization.      ""Telos is standing strong, no matter what happens at Block.one. Although we are grateful for the EOSIO codebase, it is the community that makes or breaks public blockchains,"" she wrote over Telegram.    Read more: Blockchain Platform Telos Launches Crypto Tokens That Act Like Treasurys    EOS was the first and best-known public blockchain launched using EOSIO software and the one that has by far the largest market capitalization. Block.one often speaks of advancing EOSIO but seldom of EOS. This distinction is not lost on EOS holders but it likely is lost on casual observers.      EOS is run using the delegated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism devised by Larimer and first used on STEEM, such that EOS token holders continuously participate in an election of the 21 entities that lead the chain – the parties that can resolve disputes, verify transactions and make upgrades to the network.      Those 21 entities are called ""block producers,"" and they earn new EOS as it is minted with each block for verifying transactions. They serve basically the same role as miners on the proof-of-work Bitcoin and Ethereum networks.      EOS holders often contend theirs is the most active blockchain, but subsequent research has cast significant doubt on such claims.    BTC pivot    While Larimer has been plotting his move away from Block.one, its CEO, Brendan Blumer, has been talking more and more about bitcoin alongside a pro-regulatory vision for blockchain technology.      In October, Blumer gave an interview to a Forbes contributor, in which he said, ""Block.one is a holding company, and see different business emerging but technology projects take a long time.""      In that interview, he said Block.one has three components: building out EOSIO as something that can be used by businesses, investing in other companies and building its own businesses (giving the social network Voice.com as his example).    Read more: Block.one Debuts Big-Business Version of EOSIO Blockchain    What he didn't include seems more salient to EOS token holders: making investments that will drive value to EOS in particular, rather than EOSIO.      In October, at the end of the boom on Ethereum that came to be known as DeFi Summer, EOS holders questioned Blumer on Twitter about why the DeFi boom hadn't reached EOS.      Block.one, some felt, could have funded versions of Ethereum's successful use cases on EOS, where presumably they could run with lower transaction fees.      In his response, Blumer wrote, ""We are very interested in investing in #EOS DeFi that can meet the compliance requirements of B1, and are actively on the lookout.""      The same complaint resurfaced again in January.      In November, Blumer would use the #ProFi hashtag in another tweet about the inaccessibility of DeFi for institutional investors.      ""The innovation in the #DeFi space is revolutionary, but the recent guidance of global regulators regarding its lack of compliance controls makes it difficult for mainstream capital to access the opportunity,"" he wrote.      The same day he posted about how regulators are starting to see advantages in BTC, as a form of money that's easy to supervise, seemingly echoing a point made by former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers in 2020, that money as we know it has ""too much privacy.""      The next day Blumer would take this further, with a Twitter thread in which he describes a compliance-first approach as playing the long game.      He wrote, ""At B1, we’re firm believers that the regulatory maturity of the ecosystem is advancing at an exponential rate, and the harmonious integration of both traditional and crypto ecosystems that is facilitated by compliance will continue to pave the path of mainstream adoption.""      In late November and December, his attention on Twitter would turn more and more to Bitcoin, as it did for most people in this industry. He would post about BTC replacing gold and an inadequate supply of BTC for institutional demand.      And then one of Block.one's investors, Christian Angermayer, would weigh in, calling Block.one's BTC holdings ""the most strategic #Bitcoin position in the world,"" adding the hashtag #ProFi.      What good would any of this Bitcoin talk do for EOS holders, though?      Blumer had an answer:      Its hard to imagine EOS superseding, for example, Lightning, from within the Bitcoin community as we now know it. EOS today runs on the basis of payoffs to governance participants and there's no way to know how many of the existing block producers aren't one or just a few entities or a few entities in collusion.      This is a longstanding tension in crypto, between the pioneers of the space who wanted to build a separate economy and the newcomers looking to maximize profits by plugging it into the traditional economy.      Larimer, as we'll see, leans toward the former, but Blumer's allegiance seems to be the latter. He may look forward to a future in which it is not Bitcoin's existing users relying on EOS so much as institutional adopters that want a solution that's fast, cheap and easy to track.      ""As Brendan has said in recent tweets, Block.one is working on products designed to leverage our Bitcoin position, built with the EOSIO software,"" Christina Pantin, a spokesperson for Block.one, told CoinDesk in an email. ""We believe that a network like EOS, built on EOSIO, has the capacity and scalability to bridge a highly valuable token like BTC, which is unfortunately slow and expensive to transfer.""      Aaron Cox, of the block producer candidate Greymass, told CoinDesk over Telegram that the EOS community would likely support more BTC integrations.      ""With as much tribalism as exists in this space, I don't think there's a lot of outward aggression from within the EOSIO community towards other chains – even despite all the hatred EOS/EOSIO gets,"" he wrote. ""It's not like EOS or any other EOSIO token (that I'm aware of) is out to replace projects like BTC – so it only makes sense to find ways they can support each other.""      One longtime member of the EOS community is less excited about the prospects for BTC on EOS. A pseudonymous user going by @blockchainkid on Telegram and Twitter posted:    ""Let’s call a spade a spade: the $EOS token sale was just a massive wealth transfer from retail crypto buyers to ⁦@block_one_⁩ founders and early investors.""  A series of disappointments    Colin Talks Crypto and @blockchainkid aren't the only ones who took to social media to express disappointment.      Larimer also does not seem happy with how this endeavor has turned out.      There's a meme around Larimer that he always abandons projects, but he's been working on EOS for at least three years now. And it's important to also note the major contributions he has made in the industry. They include laying the foundation for DeFi, building software to run a new consensus model and articulating the concept of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).      Larimer first announced he was leaving Block.one on the blockchain blogging site Hive, which is a hard fork of the last protocol he built, Steem. Then he substantiated the announcement on Voice, the Block.one-backed social network.      Larimer wrote:    ""I do not know exactly what is next, but I am leaning toward building more censorship resistant technologies. I have come to believe that you cannot provide 'liberty as a service' and therefore I will focus my attention on creating tools that people can use to secure their own freedom.""    In a subsequent update that followed on Hive, Larimer wrote, with seeming frustration:    ""What can we do to make EOS 'successful'? There is no single answer to that question because we all have different definitions of 'success' and the paths to 'success' can head in opposite directions. The most common definition of 'success' that I see is a high token price. EOS is 'successful' if everyone who buys it makes money. What if EOS achieved this 'success' by becoming a completely regulated, centralized, walled garden of KYC'd users?""    These comments seem to come somewhat in response to those above from his co-founder, emphasizing an investor- and regulator-friendly future for the protocol Larimer created. For his part, Larimer only had frustration for an era in which every interaction with cryptocurrency incurs a taxable event.      Larimer also seemed disappointed in the EOS community's failure to function as the sort of DAO he had envisioned. After all, it wasn't essential for them to rely on Block.one to build on EOS. The blockchain was built to fund development itself.      The EOS design assumed that token holders would support block producer candidates who did the most to drive value to the blockchain by reinvesting the tokens they earned in funding EOS applications. EOS was also designed with a fund in place that EOS holders could use collectively to pay for development as a collective.      After failing to create a governance system for EOS, the block producers burned the ""savings account"" meant to fund such development in May 2019, causing a short-term bump in price but long-term doubts about the community's commitment to a useful blockchain.      And block producers that built didn't earn community backing, by and large. Instead, the ones that primarily used their earnings to pay voters to back them came to dominate the leadership roles.      However, the CEO has defended the practice of buying votes on Twitter. ""When BP’s offer token holders revenue for their vote, it lowers the cost of network operation by passing value back to holders,"" Blumer wrote.      For his part, though, Larimer seemed to share the concerns about bribery that CoinDesk had reported on. He wrote in his Jan. 10 Hive post, ""In theory, token holders are supposed to vote in producers that provide the most value to the network. In practice, token holders vote in people who pay them kickbacks. It would be like Apple shareholders electing a board that issued new shares and distributed them as kickbacks to a subset of the shareholders.""    Read more: On EOS Blockchain, Vote Buying Is Business as Usual    After burning the savings account and devoting the block rewards to payoffs, it's no wonder the community expected Block.one to build for it. Who else could afford to?      But Block.one has shown little tangible evidence of interest in doing so. After all, the returns on Bitcoin have been so much better.    Departures    When Colin Talks Crypto described Larimer's departure as the ""last straw,"" he went on to produce another 18 minutes of frustration.      First, the fact that Voice is not running on EOS. When first announced in June 2019, Block.one had said every Voice user would get an EOS account automatically. By January 2020, it had walked that back, indicating that it wouldn't launch on EOS but that Block.one would ""like"" it to leverage the EOS public blockchain and ""potentially others.""      Last January, CEO Brendan Blumer took to Twitter to describe CoinDesk's reporting as misleading, but even then he didn't reiterate the commitment from June, instead writing only that ""publishing to public chains will diversify moderation and strengthen censorship resistance.""      Similarly, on Jan. 8, Voice.com CEO Salah Zalatimo wrote in a blog comment that can be seen republished here that the team remains committed to ""linking up with the EOS mainnet,"" language that falls short of the originally promised plan to run Voice on EOS.      In fact, CoinDesk has been only able to identify one project backed by Block.one that's running on EOS, and that's Everipedia. Another company backed by Block.one, Mythical Games, has announced its intention to run on EOS, but CoinDesk has not been able to verify that it has done so. In December, a lead developer tweeted that the game intended to ""connect"" with the mainnet. A request for comment to the company has not been returned by press time.      When asked to confirm whether or not these were the company's only investments that run atop EOS, Block.one responded but didn't answer the question.      ""Block.one and its partner funds have made more than 70+ investments into companies already using EOSIO, intending to move to EOSIO, or looking to use EOSIO,"" Pantin wrote.      As previously noted, EOSIO is not EOS.      Many EOS holders also found encouragement in the October announcement that Google Cloud would deploy a block producer candidate. There have been no updates on this initiative three months later.      Google confirmed the original report to CoinDesk but, upon follow-up, Google spokesperson Jane Khodos told CoinDesk in an email, ""Unfortunately we can't comment about our customers.""      One longtime EOS backer emailed CoinDesk last week to say that it might soon be time to write a post-mortem for the blockchain. Of course, the death of EOS is unlikely. Blockchains hardly ever truly die.      But, for many early proponents, including – in particular – the man who created it, it seems the hopes that brought them to EOS have already been laid to rest.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/01/19/dan-larimers-departure-brings-eos-disappointments-to-the-fore,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1e94905b909d14c9aa0fde8acc30e3ca15de234d-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385687,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB5xdn,1611091990,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Hangs at $36.4K While Ether Flies to Over $1.4K,"Trading action in the bitcoin market slowed Tuesday while ether’s price broke new ground.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $36,483 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Climbing 0.85% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $36,029-$37,876 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC below the 10-hour but above the 50-hour moving averages on the hourly chart, a sideways signal for market technicians.    The price of bitcoin stayed in a fairly tight range Tuesday, spending most of U.S. trading hours between $36,200 and $37,200. At around 15:00 UTC (11 a.m. ET), the price spiked to as high as $37,876 before dropping and was at $36,483 as of press time.      “Interesting yesterday that bitcoin held its price in a quiet U.S. market with the [Martin Luther King Day] holiday,” noted Chris Thomas, head of digital assets for Swissquote Bank. “This also suggests that U.S. clients, both retail and institutional, are quite important.”      Read More: Bitcoin’s Price Must Pass $40K to Halt Exodus of Traders: JPMorgan      “We had two failed attempts to break and stay above $40,000, but we saw that at $20,000 and $30,000 as well,” said Thomas. “I suspect we’ll get through $40,000 in the next day or two.”      In the meantime, as prices stay less volatile than before, traders appear to be adding on more risk.      “Looks like while bitcoin is being squeezed between a tightening $34,000-$38,000 range in the past week, the market is going more leveraged long,” noted Cindy Leow, portfolio manager for multi-strategy trading firm 256 Capital partners.      According to data aggregator Skew, leveraged funding on major venues remains high. Kraken in particular has shown a high degree of volatility in funding rates, but as of Tuesday is offering the most for crypto holders to provide liquidity to leverage up long, at 0.0471%.      “We see this as short-term bearish, indicating too many market participants are eager for an upside breakout,” Leow added. “Adding on to that, sellers seem exhausted, and the market is very short on dollars with frothy USD/stablecoin lending rates.”      According to DeFi Pulse, lending on the decentralized finance, or DeFi, market has passed $12 billion, with the stablecoin Maker dai (DAI) taking up over 39% of that share. Dai currently makes up $4.7 billion of the DeFi lending market, up over 11% Tuesday.      Some of this DeFi spike is also coming from a rising price in ether, which saw a breakout Tuesday to fresh highs whereas bitcoin has stayed relatively quiet. “Ether is looking really strong and I think we’re now entering a race between a $2,000 ETH and $50,000 BTC,” said Swissquote’s Thomas.      “We see ETH likely facing some resistance at its all-time-high, similar to how BTC was initially rejected in November 2020 at its previous $19,000 high before resuming an uptrend,” said 256 Capital’s Leow.    Ether hits a record high    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Tuesday, trading around $1,384 and climbing 12.7% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      The spot price of ether hit an all-time high Tuesday, going up to $1,439 and just edging out its previous high from $1,432.88 set Jan. 13, 2018.      Read More: Ethereum’s Ether Cryptocurrency Sets New All-Time Price High Near $1,440      George Clayton, managing partner of crypto fund Cryptanalysis Capital, questions the fundamentals behind ether’s rise while bitcoin seems uncorrelated with ETH’s rise. “Interesting price action,” Clayton told CoinDesk.      He noted that average fees on the network usually spike with these price runs, which actually hurts usability. Ethereum’s DeFi projects get more expensive to use during price runs because processing fees, or “gas” in increments of ether, are required for its use.      “With fees at such astronomical levels, Ethereum is becoming sclerotic and exclusive,” Clayton added. “Have to hope that ETH 1.5 and rollups relieve some pressure.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly green Tuesday. Notable winners as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET):    xrp (XRP) + 7.5%  bitcoin cash (BCH) + 6.6%  litecoin (LTC) + 6.4%    Notable losers:    kyber network (KNC) - 7%  0x (ZRX) - 6%  algorand (ALGO) - 5.4%    Equities:    Asia’s Nikkei 225 index closed up 1.4%, boosted by big-time gains in Mitsui Engineering & Shipbuilding, which climbed 13.8% Tuesday.  In Europe the FTSE 100 ended the day flat, in the red 0.11% as gambling firm Entain lost 12% after MGM Resorts pulled out of a possible takeover deal for the company.  In the United States, the S&P 500 climbed 0.80% as anticipation of fresh U.S. government stimulus and a faster deployment of coronavirus vaccinations had investors hitting the buy button.    Commodities:    Oil was up 1.8%. Price per barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude: $53.00.  Gold was flat, in the green 0.10% and at $1,838 as of press time.

42385681,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB5xWF,1611089097,Bitcoin Is Aiding the Ransomware Industry,"What do the smart watch maker Garmin, the Israeli insurer Shirbit, the electronics manufacturer Foxconn, Pennsylvania's Delaware county, the foreign exchange company Travelex, the alcohol producer Campari and the Baltimore Public School system have in common?      They were all hit by ransomware attacks in the last year.    Boaz Sobrado is a London-based data analyst and cryptocurrency enthusiast.    Ransomware attacks are when hackers gain access to the computer systems of the victim, and threaten to expose them or render them useless unless the victim pays a ransom. The attacks are increasingly professional. Victims are directed to a ""user support"" site where they can chat with the ransomware operators. Sometimes they can see a ticking clock: If the ransom is not paid within 24 hours, the ransom amount doubles.      The COVID-19 pandemic forced even reluctant companies to start working remotely, which was a blessing for ransomware operators. The average ransom payment in Q2 2020 was over $178,000, which is a 60% increase from Q1 2020. Ransomware operators have also improved on their methods. Whereas a few years ago attacks were largely “spray-and-pray,” hackers are now deliberately picking their targets and adjusting ransom amounts based on what they think those targets can pay. The ransom is often only part of the cost.      The Danish facilities company ISS estimated that a ransomware incident in February will end up costing it between $45 million to $75 million in IT upgrades and other measures. These ransoms are almost always paid in bitcoin. It is estimated that ransomware operations will cause $20 billion in damages this year.      See also: JP Koning - Ban All Ransomware Payments, in Bitcoin or Otherwise      The ransomware industry is experiencing rapid growth, and governments are increasingly aware. On Jan. 6, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a warning to the private sector about Egreror, a ransomware operator that has affected Barnes & Noble, Kmart and Ubisoft. CoinDesk columnist JP Koning has argued for a government ban on companies paying for ransomware, as a way to reduce the incentive for criminals to engage in these attacks. We are a high-profile hack away from ransomware being a topic in mainstream politics.    We are a high-profile hack away from ransomware being a topic in mainstream politics.    The emergence of bitcoin has facilitated a crime that previously was not possible. Yet, there is no reason why the use of bitcoin for ransom should be considered only for online crime. When an American businessman was kidnapped in Costa Rica in 2018, his kidnappers demanded (and received) a ransom in bitcoin. Known cases of kidnapping for bitcoin are rare as of now, but it is just a matter of time until kidnappers understand the product market fit. In fact, bitcoin adoption is growing fastest in countries like in Nigeria, where kidnapping has been called ""a growth industry.""      Bitcoin ransom payments may enable new forms of real-world crime. In the past, Somali pirates risked their lives for a ransom payment that had to be airdropped from a helicopter. In the future, pirates may simply steer an explosive-laden, remote-controlled ship next to an oil tanker and tweet a picture with a bitcoin address at the shipping company. Private jets flying out of Davos may find themselves approached by autonomous aircraft threatening to smash into the rudder unless demands are met.      See also: Boaz Sobrado - DeFi Still Needs a Silk Road Moment      Bitcoin is highly liquid, censorship-resistant digital cash. These properties make it attractive for criminals but also pro-democracy activists. The Human Rights Foundation championed bitcoin for its important role in helping protestors in Belarus, Hong Kong and Nigeria. Bitcoin is also gaining acceptance as an effective hedge against inflation and government confiscation on Wall Street.      While people like U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon and outgoing President Donald Trump continue to criticize digital currencies, the cat is out of the bag.

42385686,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB5xbH,1611083423,"Blockchain Bites: 'Crowded' Crypto Traders, Ether All-Time High, the Bitcoin Battery Proposal","Ether reached new highs, more people than ever are “long bitcoin” and a debate over bitcoin’s energy consumption is raging.    Top shelf    Out of the ether? Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain network, hit a fresh high of $1,439.33, up $19 from a previous record level of $1,420 in 2018. The currency is up well over 1000% since the initial public sale of ETH in 2015, according to Messari. CoinDesk’s Will Foxley reports ETH has a different value proposition from bitcoin, which has also been on a tear in recent months, due to its programmability, developer-friendly community and legacy of serving as the foundation of some of crypto’s biggest trends including ICOs and DeFi.      Crowds trade Bank of America found that “long bitcoin” is now the most crowded trade among fund managers, finally unseating “long tech.” Essentially this means investors are placing bullish bets on bitcoin – for what I assume is a variety of reasons including bitcoin’s deflationary attributes amid record money printing as well as herd mentality. The survey found that shorting the dollar is now the third most popular trade. Meanwhile, JPMorgan thinks bitcoin needs to cross $40,000 again to keep from bleeding investors while South Korean fintech firm Dunamu has revealed a “fear and greed” digital asset index.

Bitcoin notched two straight days of gains, but is still trapped in the $34,000 and $40,000 range – hovering near $37,000 at press time. “This period of consolidation is building a solid base, giving those who wish to sell bitcoin plenty of time,” according to the cryptocurrency exchange firm Diginex.    At stake    Bitcoin battery With bitcoin at record levels, a number of critics have come out of the woodwork to present counter-narratives of the recent market rally or reasons why the cryptocurrency should be banned. Of all the age-old critiques of the cryptocurrency, the one that is most damaging, and perhaps most sympathetic to outsiders, is bitcoin’s intense energy consumption.      On Sunday, London-based software engineer Stephen Deihl composed a tweet thread discussing the environmental impact of bitcoin mining. Citing WolframAlpha data, Diehl claims that the “bitcoin network annually wastes 78 TWh (terrawatt hours),” said to be enough to power “several million U.S. households.”      This is a “giant smoldering Chernobyl sitting at the heart of Silicon Valley,” Diehl writes. He’s not alone. Apple engineer Fredrick Jacobs joined the fracas saying the financial incentives of bitcoin can lead to wasted, “often not green,” energy.      It’s indisputable that bitcoin is a consumptive good. Just as mining gold has a range of externalities, so does bitcoin. In 2018, the World Economic Forum (WEF) estimated that the global bitcoin network consumes as much energy as Ireland. I’ve also heard Austria and Venezuela as points of comparison. For those who see little value of a distributed, un-censorable currency, this is unconscionable. It’s enough to turn any sane observer into a crypto Kaczynski.      As ever, bitcoin’s supporters have come out to counter these claims. The Schelling point bitcoin champions have landed on this time around is the idea that “bitcoin is a battery.” Not only is bitcoin a store of value, but it could be seen as a useful store of energy.      As CoinShares Chief Strategy Officer Meltem Demirors writes, bitcoin “makes energy mutable, portable, storable and transferable by turning it into money.” In other words, bitcoin is a “battery” because it takes energy and turns it into a currency that can be used to pay for energy later.      There are a boatload of ideological and material assumptions baked into this battery idea. But is it wrong?      At the most basic level, this is precisely the business model of bitcoin miners. The owners and operators of bitcoin’s specialized mining equipment deploy their systems wherever there is cheap, readily available power. These machines solve complex mathematical problems that secure the ~$700 billion network and are rewarded with a bitcoin subsidy.      This payout is then often cashed out to pay the power bills. Complicating this idea slightly, Bitcoin advocate and author Knut Svanholm, an early promulgator of the “bitcoin battery” concept, said: “It is important to remember that it does not convert energy into value directly but rather electricity into digital scarcity. Digital scarcity which then can be programmed to express value.”      This doesn’t address the issue of bitcoin’s energy draw directly, but is a defense of bitcoin as a scarce, valuable asset worth powering. A similar line of defense is to compare bitcoin to other energy-intensive goods or services. What about Netflix? What about Twitter? Are not most internet-based platforms major draws on the power grid with arguably limited usability?      I was born at the tail end of the millennial generation, and as such am painfully aware of the environmental catastrophe humanity is staring down. I turn off the lights when I exit a room. I buy nuts and grains in bulk. In elementary school, I gave a report on recycling and have kept up the habit. I am committed to the idea of using less and preserving more.      It’s for this reason that I want to take bitcoin’s environmental footprint seriously.      The last line of defense (that I’ll cover) is the idea that bitcoin is green, to an extent. It’s frequently claimed that the majority of bitcoin mining is powered by renewable sources. CoinShares estimated, in 2019, that 73% of bitcoin’s “energy mix” is from renewables. Others say that a fair amount of bitcoin is mined using energy that would have been otherwise wasted – such as from natural gas flaring.      “Bitcoin thrives on the margins, where energy is lost or curtailed,” Nic Carter wrote in a CoinDesk op-ed titled “Last Word on Bitcoin’s Energy Consumption.”      Along these lines, WEF argued in 2018 that renewables providers, like wind or solar farms, should consider turning on crypto miners whenever there is a surplus of energy when the sun is shining and the skies a’blowing. “[I]f the grids are overloaded, clean energy is abundantly wasted,” they write. “For every block added to the chain by this method, there will be no accompanying carbon emissions.”      This isn’t a bad idea. But I think there is a blindspot that could also explain one of the weakest claims that bitcoin is green. In short, a block subsidy that’s won by an eco-friendly miner isn’t carbon free, there’s a whole network of miners competing for the same subsidy that may not be plugged into a hydroelectric port.      Bitcoin is wasteful by design. No matter what percentage of hash power is green is besides the point. Proof-of-work is wasteful, and there will always be people that are offended by that. And ideas of coordinating the bitcoin network to turn on and off depending on energy production will never work. Right now, coordinating a network of bitcoin miners is easy, because there is no coordination – people plug in their miners and let them rip.      Underlying the environmental discussion is a presumption of whether bitcoin has any value, and whether that value is worth the cost. Unchained Capital framed bitcoin’s energy-value in near-apocalyptic terms:      “Future economic stability is fundamentally why there can be no more important source of demand for the consumption of energy than the security of bitcoin’s monetary system, especially when the alternatives (fiat and gold) are structurally flawed.”      It doesn’t have to be so black and white. But when it comes to bitcoin’s future, it’s worth asking what powers bitcoin could disrupt.

Speaking at a Senate Finance Committee hearing on her anticipated nomination after President-elect Joe Biden takes office tomorrow, Yellen said the U.S. should be aware of emerging tools for terrorist financing.      “The technologies to accomplish this change over time and we need to make sure that our methods for dealing with these matters, with tech terrorist financing, change along with changing technology, cryptocurrencies are a particular concern,” she said in response to a question by Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), who called crypto use in terrorist financing a “growing concern.”      Hassan was asking about last year’s National Defense Authorization Act, which includes a provision for examining how terrorists might use new financial technologies to raise funds. Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) led the provision’s inclusion.      “I think many [cryptocurrencies] are used, at least in transactions sense, mainly for illicit financing and I think we really need to examine ways in which we can curtail their use and make sure that anti-money laundering doesn't occur through those channels,” Yellen said Tuesday.

That’s all good for the disruptive financial technologies.    James Cooper is a Professor of Law and Associate Dean of Experiential Learning at California Western School of Law. He is moderating a panel for Digital Davos on Jan. 20 on ethics and technologies in developing countries.    Also, the naming of former Secretary of State John Kerry to a cabinet-level position as Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, is a signal of the new administration’s commitment to tackling global climate change. He understands the importance of cryptocurrency. At the World Economic Forum three years ago this week, Kerry was quoted as saying cryptocurrency has “got value.” Together, these two appointees can ensure the country leads fintech development while preventing crypto mining from contributing to more greenhouse gases.      A raft of projects abroad are already primed for success in the green mining space and can act as models for the United States. In 2019, Bitfury set up mining centers in Paraguay, home to South America’s biggest hydro-electric project – the Itaipu Dam – the world’s largest generator of renewable clean energy. The government in Asunción has backed the Commons Foundation’s Golden Goose project, in its attempt to establish the region as the world’s largest crypto mining center. But there is a challenge to keep the Paraguay project itself from contributing to greenhouse gases given the intense heat that the tropical country faces year round. It would be counter-productive to use a lot of energy to cool the computers even if the energy was being produced by renewable sources.      See also: Jeff Bandman - What Crypto Can Expect From Gary Gensler at the SEC      Cost-effective mining centers based on renewable energy have also been established in Russia’s frozen lands of Siberia. The city of Norilsk is home to the mineral mining behemoth Norilsk Nickel but increasingly bitcoin mining is becoming an important economic driver. With temperatures in winter bottoming out at minus 40 degrees Celsius (which is roughly minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit), this is a perfect climate by which to keep computing machines cool. It’s a lot cooler than Paraguay for sure.      Nor should we forget about China, the home to over half the bitcoin miners in the world, the majority of whom are situated in Sichuan due to low energy costs, powered by hydro-electric facilities. That the area has recently suffered some of the worst flooding in 70 years, largely due to climate change, shows that irony is as much at play here as hash rates. Poolin, which controls the majority of BTC hash rate, has had trouble with consistent energy supplies and some of its mining farms have been inundated by monsoon floods. Even with the province’s vast hydro-electric capabilities, the authorities in the People’s Republic of China have generally banned the digital asset industry – shuttering mining, exchanges and industry conferences.      A more secure and geographically proximate project is rolling out near the Churchill Falls hydro-electric plant in Labrador, a remote part of Eastern Canada. Pow.re, a Montreal-based company with investors from Asia, is taking advantage of the stranded energy that NL Hydro generates. This hydro-electric facility is long past emitting mercury traces, so the project meets many environmental protection and sustainable development goals. The temperature rarely exceeds 60 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer, ensuring that the machines stay cool. The only source of waste is heat – which is a luxury in the sub-Arctic region where they are mining.      See also: State of Crypto: What the Crypto World Should Watch for in the Biden Era      The United States has much to learn from such foreign green mining projects. There are some new initiatives to encourage bitcoin mining stateside (including a new legislative bill in Kentucky to provide state tax incentives), but many of these are not green and may contribute to the earth’s warming. Coal-fired power plants supply 73% of Kentucky’s electrical generation, for example, dulling the greenness of that project. (Layer1's mining project in Texas, by contrast, is prized for its environmental performance.)      And while bountiful and clean electricity are critical to providing hash rates that are cost effective and have little environmental impact, so are champions in major policy-making positions. The combination of Gensler and Kerry in the Biden administration can help position the United States at the forefront of green mining. President Biden promised to ""build back better."" Green mining is one such way. Private companies are getting in on this opportunity too: Square Crypto recently announced a $10 million fund to promote projects that use green energy for bitcoin mining.      The U.S. government has much to gain by providing regulatory clarity for fintech and environmentally sound policies for cryptocurrency mining. If it does not, there are plenty of other countries to take the lead and profit accordingly.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION,James Cooper,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/01/19/the-us-can-make-bitcoin-mining-greener,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e4048f19550159f190e8fda24bb326b7e89e630-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a Banque de France statement, the pilot involved the settlement on a private blockchain, provided by U.K. blockchain startup SETL, of around €2 million (US$2.43 million).  The French bank used SETL’s fund management platform Iznes, along with Citi, CACEIS, Groupama AM, OFI AM, and DXC, as part of the process for the first settlement of funds using CBDC.  More experiments of the pilot program are underway through mid-year and the process will be an important contribution to research around the interest of a CBDC, said the bank.  Francois Villeroy de Galhau, governor of the Banque de France, has spoken openly of the potential benefits in the development and issuance of the CBDC.  In 2020, the French bank published a request for proposals for CBDC “experiment” applications.

42385679,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB5xUz,1611075899,Brave Becomes First Browser to Offer Native IPFS Integration,"The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a decentralized peer-to-peer protocol designed to make the web less centralized and to avoid censorship, has been integrated into the desktop web browser Brave, making it the first browser to have a native IPFS integration.      The move continues to add accessibility to IPFS, allowing Brave users to access content on the protocol by “resolving ipfs:// URIs via a gateway or installing a full IPFS node in one click,” according to a statement accompanying the announcement.      “IPFS is important for blockchain and for self-described data integrity,” said Brian Bondy, CTO and co-founder of Brave, in an email to CoinDesk. “Previously viewed content can even be accessed offline with IPFS. The IPFS network gives access to content even if it has been censored by corporations and nation-states, such as for example, parts of Wikipedia.”    What truly decentralized access to information can look like    According to Dietrich Ayala, technical product manager of browser integrations at IPFS, while the protocol is still in development, making it easily and directly available is important for users who have real problems in their daily online lives around internet access, trust of data, censorship and addressing data from blockchains for Web 3.0 apps.      One goal of this integration is to provide an early look at what truly decentralized access to information can look like and get feedback from developers and users so IPFS can start layering on more features and functionality in Brave, according to Ayala.      Read more: Cloudflare Unveils Gateway to Distributed Web With ENS, IPFS Integration      Brave users who enable the IPFS node will have a network that still functions during internet outages and shutdowns and, for example, can access critical information such as COVID-19 news which is censored in some countries.      IPFS keeps what you browse so it can be used while offline, which is key in places with expensive internet access or spotty networks.      “IPFS also provides the ability to share and collaborate in offline or disconnected environments – nodes can discover each other over local networks even when not connected to the internet,” said Ayala. “Easy and direct availability of IPFS through the Brave browser radically lowers the bar for developers to take advantage of these features in the applications.”    IPFS: How it works    As CoinDesk reporter Daniel Kuhn wrote last year, IPFS is “a radical redesign of how people navigate and use the internet.”      Read more: InterPlanetary File System Is Uncensorable During Coronavirus News Fog      “The current paradigm of web-search runs HTTP, which sends requests for online content to a single server that stores information, meaning that if anything is changed or blocked there is no reliable way to access it again,” he wrote.      “IPFS, a peer-to-peer protocol, instead allows users to download webpages and content stored across multiple servers and provides “historical versioning” that shows how documents have been manipulated. “      With this new integration, Brave users will have easier access to the protocol, while also offloading server costs from the content publisher and improving the overall resilience of the internet. There are currently over 4,000 IPFS contributors worldwide; the Brave browser is used by 24 million people, potentially expanding the reach of IPFS.      A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a unique web identifier made up of a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or a Uniform Resource Name and is used to retrieve information on a network.      “Brave users will be able to load ipfs:// and ipns:// URIs, which gives users the ability to load a lot of new content which they can’t access in other browsers,” said Bondy. “Dapps are ideal candidates to be hosted on IPFS, and some dapps make use of referencing IPFS content.”      The news comes less than a week after internet hosting behemoth Cloudflare announced that it will be able to connect to domains hosted on the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) and IPFS, further expanding IPFS’ reach.      “At Cloudflare Research, we have been exploring alternative ways to resolve queries to responses that align with these attributes.

Chainalysis reports in 2020, cryptocurrency criminal activity fell to 0.34%, or $10.0 billion in transaction volume, compared with 2019, when criminal activity represented 2.1% of all transaction volume or roughly $21.4 billion worth of transfers.  One of the reasons for the decline is due to overall economic activity nearly tripling between 2019 and 2020, but the overall amount of cryptocurrency-related crime is falling and is an even smaller part of the cryptocurrency economy, said the firm.  Chainalysis highlighted scams were much smaller in 2020 compared to the enormous PlusToken Ponzi scheme in 2019, which took in over $2 billion from millions of victims.  The majority of the cryptocurrency-related scams, around 54%, were made up of illicit activity followed by darknet markets which was the second-largest crime category, accounting for $1.7 billion worth of activity, up from $1.3 billion in 2019.  Chainalysis said the “big story” for cryptocurrency-based crime in 2020 is the rise of ransomware which, while only accounting for 7% of all funds received by criminal addresses at just under $350 million worth of cryptocurrency, was up 311% from 2019. The number of ransomware incidents could even be higher due to the low reporting rate, the firm said.  The COVID-19 pandemic has forced more people to work-from-home and in turn this has opened up new vulnerabilities to ransomware attacks for many organizations, said the firm.

Announced Tuesday, the new automated market maker (AMM), which has just gone live, is focused on preventing slippage in value between different types of pegged-value assets like stablecoins and tokenized bitcoin. The startup, which now has four full-time coders, was recently spun out of Thesis, the a16z-backed firm behind projects like Fold, tBTC and Keep.      Slippage refers to the difference between the expected price of a trade and the executed price of that trade. Crypto being highly volatile and reactive, means even stablecoins and pegged tokens get hit with a large amount of slippage when traded on-chain.      “If you’re trading $100 USDC for USDT, you’d expect to get pretty close to $100 USDT,” Saddle founder Sunil Srivatsa said in an interview. “For the longest time, that wasn't possible. You would trade $100 of USDC, and maybe get out like $97 or $98 [in USDT].”      Read more: Bitcoin-on-Ethereum Token tBTC Relaunches Following Buggy Debut in May      AMMs like Uniswap and others, which pool capital together and set rules for how you trade against the pool, have tolerance settings where users can set the maximum percentage of price movement they can live with.      “So one of the problems that we're setting out to solve is to basically unlock deep on-chain liquidity for pegged value crypto assets,” said Srivatsa, a former Uber engineer also known as @devops199fan to those in the DeFi community. “That means you're able to make trades and lose a very minimal amount to slippage and transaction fees.”      Saddle plans to use Synthetix’s virtual synths. (Synthetix makes synthetic assets where instead of trading ETH for USD, users trade sETH for sUSD.)      Srivatsa said there is currently a limitation with the Synthetix system, since trades between “synths” come with a five-minute settlement delay before a trader gets the underlying assets (this is to prevent front running).

42385684,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB5xXV,1611065422,State of Crypto: What the Crypto World Should Watch for in the Biden Era,"Hello and welcome to State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter examining the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. I’m your host, Nikhilesh De.      In this week’s debut issue, I take a look at some of the key topics and stories I expect to see this year, a day ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Joseph R. Biden and as the Democratic Party takes control of both houses of Congress.      Click here to sign up for State of Crypto.    A new administration  Key narrative    Former Vice President Joe Biden is set to take the top office in the U.S. tomorrow. His nominees for federal office will shape crypto policy in the country for years to come. And once again, the same major party controls Congress as well as the presidency, which means a unified economic and regulatory agenda may be implemented.    Why it matters  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) will all see a change in leadership. Next year, so will the Federal Reserve.  The SEC is suing Ripple Labs and two executives on allegations they sold XRP in unregistered securities sales for over seven years, which has implications for companies that didn’t conduct initial coin offerings but may have still sold tokens.  The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is considering a number of rules that bring crypto transactions under closer scrutiny.  The OCC has issued a number of interpretative letters over the past year under an acting head that powerful Dems on the Financial Services Committee already want overturned.  Congress will consider how it can implement new real-time payments services and boost financial inclusion this year, targeting two goals that the crypto community has long discussed. This is a conversation the industry wants to participate in.  Democrats are furious at Republicans who they think helped incite the attempted Capitol insurrection in January, and that could have implications for crypto-friendly legislation spearheaded by Representatives who objected to the Electoral College votes.  Breaking it down    Let’s take things in order.      Biden announced Monday he would tap former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Gary Gensler to head the SEC. This is important for a few reasons. For one thing, Gensler understands crypto and blockchain. He’s not adored by Wall Street and it’s doubtful he’ll create a regulatory regime that the crypto industry will love, but at least there are reasonable chances of getting a clear regulatory structure. Plus, his fellow CFTC alum Jeffrey Bandman believes he may approve a bitcoin exchange-traded fund.      As far as litigation goes, I would be surprised if the SEC suit against Ripple was dropped. We are in the early stages of this litigation. While Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has said previous attempts at negotiating a settlement failed, that doesn’t mean we won’t see a settlement before the court case ends.      I haven’t seen anything on who Biden might tap to head the CFTC, and the OCC's new chief hasn't been announced. Currently the CFTC’s Heath Tarbert plans to step down from the chair role, while the OCC’s Brian Brooks left last week. The chances of having a crypto-savvy trifecta leading the three agencies are low. It’s also worth watching the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for how they approach the question of stablecoins and insurance for banks touching on crypto.    FinCEN: A question mark    As of my writing this, the domestic money laundering watchdog has extended the comment period on a controversial rule proposal that would require crypto exchanges to record name and address info for transactions aggregating over $3,000 per person per day that go to private wallets (also referred to as unhosted wallets, or self-hosted wallets, or just wallets). The industry wasn’t wild about this rule; it could break decentralized finance smart contracts (which have neither names nor addresses), create potential honeypots of information (remember last year’s headlines about Treasury/FinCEN being hacked and private files released?) and result in a massive burden for exchanges. Coinbase alone expected the new rule would require it to file some 7,000 reports per day.      Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was reportedly the main government official pushing the rule, and with Janet Yellen taking over that role it’s hard to know if this rule will be modified, yanked entirely or implemented. Yellen hasn’t commented on bitcoin since 2018, when she dismissed it in some public remarks. But as Fed Chair she indicated she was against heavily regulating the industry.      What’s really interesting about FinCEN’s extension of the comment period is it bifurcated the different parts of the rule. One aspect, which FinCEN said was a typical currency transaction report rule (i.e., the $10,000 reporting requirement), gets just a further 15 days. However, the record-keeping and counterparty detail is seeing a 45-day extension due to how “complex” the issue is. This was the part that raised the most ire among industry participants, so I imagine they’ll welcome the longer time period to discuss this with the regulators. Also worth watching: The thresholds rule and offshore reporting rule FinCEN brought up near the end of last year.    OCC: Brooks’ legacy    The OCC’s in an interesting position. On the one hand, this banking regulator just granted a national trust charter to Anchorage, converting it from a South Dakota trust company to a federal one, effectively making it the first crypto-native national bank. While it doesn’t yet have benefits like FDIC insurance, the company told my colleague Ian Allison that is absolutely on the menu. Granting this charter is the capstone of Brooks’ tenure at the regulatory agency, which lasted all of eight months and also included a handful of interpretative letters that sought to define how national banks could interact with the crypto space.      The attention Brooks paid to crypto guidance angered several House Democrats, who asked him to focus more on pandemic and economic relief late last year. House Financial Services Committee Chair Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) went a step further, writing an open letter to Biden asking him to rescind all recent rulemaking and guidance under the Trump era, which would include all of the OCC letters.      The charter likely cannot be easily revoked though, and while Brooks may have sped the publication of these letters, Senior Deputy Comptroller Jonathan Gould told me last year that the agency had already been looking into much of its guidance over the last few years, a statement Brooks echoed at a public seminar last week. In other words, despite what some lawmakers might want this guidance might be here to stay. Whether any bank acts on it is another question entirely.      Meanwhile, Politico is reporting Biden might tap Professor Mehrsa Baradaran of the University of California, Irvine, or Dean Michael Barr of the University of Michigan Ford School of Public Policy to succeed Brooks. Baradaran has testified on crypto multiple times in Congress, while Barr joined Ripple's board of advisers in 2015.    Congress: Bringing back real-time payments    Let’s get to the really interesting bits: Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) is going to run the Senate Banking Committee for the next congressional session, and one focus will be on real-time payments and how to implement them, as well as bringing the financially excluded onto payment rails. An idea being tossed around is postal banking, where post offices (which are plentiful) are able to provide certain financial services. Rohan Grey, a legislative adviser who helped create the STABLE Act, said FedAccounts will likely receive a lot of attention. Brown himself mentioned the concept during a virtual media availability. “The Fed will administer, not subsidize, a no-fee account. It can be done online, it can be done at post offices … you can get access perhaps at a small bank in your neighborhood,” he said of the idea.      One common perception around crypto is that proof-of-work networks like Bitcoin are incredibly energy intensive and are primarily powered by oil or coal plants. Industry participants say hydroelectric and other forms of renewable energy sources are used instead. Either way, regulators like the New York Department of Financial Services and CFTC are warning their regulated firms to be mindful of the environmental costs of their services. Crypto miners in the U.S. in particular may see new requests or regulations heading their way.      The other major storyline to watch out for is how exactly Congress will proceed in the coming weeks and months. We all saw the mob breach the U.S. Capitol building in January, followed by several Republican senators and representatives objecting to accepting certified Electoral College votes from Arizona and Pennsylvania. Several members of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus gave speeches and voted against accepting the votes – essentially disagreeing with consensus, to use a rough crypto analogy. Punchbowl News reported that some Democratic lawmakers and aides are considering freezing the objectors out of parts of the legislative process.      This could mean bills introduced by blockchain proponents including Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio), such as the Token Taxonomy Act, might go nowhere if they’re introduced or reintroduced this year. Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association, said the “political tensions right now are incredibly high,” and noted that “there’s currently a lot of pressure on Democrats to stop working across the aisle with anyone who voted the other way” last week, though she expects this to subside as time moves on. “The Democrats may have the White House, the House and the Senate today but they won’t always be on that side of things and they’ll want to work across the aisle when they’re in the minority as well,” she said. “I’m hopeful we’ll return to seeing some bipartisanship.”      Speaking of the insurrection, Twitter banned outgoing President Donald Trump, as did other social media firms. Big Tech’s role in society was already going to be a question for Congress, but after deplatforming the U.S. president, expect those conversations to take on a new level of importance. Also important, but perhaps less discussed: Some payment processors also deplatformed Trump supporters and his campaign.    Elsewhere  Alt-Right Groups Received $500K in BTC Month Before Capitol Riot: Chainalysis: Actually, there’s more about this insurrection we should talk about. Last week, analytics firm Chainalysis published a blog post noting that 13.5 BTC had been sent to 22 wallets, some of which were tied to far-right activists who participated in the mob on Jan. 6. The bitcoin appears to have been sent by a French computer programmer who has since passed away, according to Chainalysis. Crypto has been tied to extremists before, and as the new legislative session begins it would not surprise me if legislation to combat terrorist funding via crypto is raised again. The other concern legislators and regulators may have is that these funds reportedly came from overseas – foreign funds involved in U.S. politics is a sticky area for local lawmakers.  Tron-Owned Video Platform Criticized for Hosting Extremists, US Capitol Rioters: People deplatformed from YouTube and Twitch for espousing hate and/or violence turned to DLive, which pays creators in crypto and is owned by Tron. Mind you, Tron/DLive is now also kicking off anyone who streamed from the Capitol.  Jerome Powell on CBDCs: ‘We Don’t Feel a Need to Be First’: Fed Chair Jerome Powell talked about stablecoins and CBDCs last week. In short: he said stablecoins might pose risks, and the U.S. is working with other nations on this (more libra talk?), and central bank digital currencies are probably coming later rather than sooner. I’ll just refer you to my colleague Nate DiCamillo’s reporting above.  Outside crypto  Andrew Yang is running for office again. This time, the crypto proponent has set his sights on New York’s mayoral race. As with his former presidential run, Yang is advocating for a $2,000 universal basic income, among other policies.

42385685,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB5xcX,1611065278,First Mover: Ethereum Steals Limelight With New All-Time High Price as Bitcoiners HODL,"Bitcoin (BTC) was higher for a second day, staying in the past two weeks' range of between roughly $34,000 and $40,000.      ""This period of consolidation is building a solid base, giving those who wish to sell bitcoin plenty of time,"" according to the cryptocurrency exchange firm Diginex.      Ether (ETH), the Ethereum blockchain's main cryptocurrency, rose Tuesday to a new all-time high of $1,439.33, reaching price levels not seen since early 2018. The LINK token from Chainlink, which provides price feeds to decentralized trading and lending systems built atop blockchain networks, also set a record price.      Read More: Ethereum's Ether Cryptocurrency Sets New Price Record on Major Exchanges      With the bitcoin market trading sideways, some investors might be rotating into so-called alternative cryptocurrencies for faster returns, Edward Moya, a senior market analyst for the foreign-exchange broker Oanda, said in emailed comments.      ""The cryptoverse is growing again, and right now many cryptocurrency traders are diversifying into other coins,"" Moya said.      In traditional markets, Asian and European shares rose and U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher open ahead of Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen's confirmation hearing. The former Federal Reserve chair is expected to call for the government to ""act big"" on stimulus borrowing and spending, to aid the economic recovery.      Gold strengthened 0.2% to $1,845 an ounce.      CORRECTION: (17:42 UTC, Jan. 20, 2021): An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the new all-time high price for ether. The piece has been updated to reflect the record price of $1,439.33 reached early Tuesday.)    Market moves    With bitcoin prices up 26% so far in January after quadrupling in 2020 and doubling the year before that, a trader might be forgiven for looking to take some profits.      But based on data extracted from the underlying blockchain network, investors appear content to sit tight, apparently betting a new rally could quickly take the cryptocurrency to fresh all-time highs.      Delphi Digital, a cryptocurrency analysis firm, noted last week in a report that bitcoin balances on cryptocurrency exchanges had decreased to about 2.3 million from 2.4 million over the past month as prices rose. Often, when prices rise the balances increase as more investors transfer bitcoins to the exchange to be liquidated.      ""The net outflow this time around is potentially indicative of the long-term focused nature of recent investors,"" according to the Delphi analysts, Yan Liberman and Kevin Kelly.      The exchange outflows dovetail with other blockchain data showing more bitcoin being held by investors for the long term, known in crypto-industry jargon as HODLing.      Analysts for Glassnode, a blockchain-data firm, noted Monday that the number of bitcoins held in ""accumulation addresses"" has climbed by 17% over the past year to more than 2.7 million. These are addresses that have only ever received bitcoin and never spent them.      ""This increase highlights the massive supply restriction that is occurring in the BTC market, with almost 15% of the total supply held in these addresses,"" according to the firm.      Some 14.6 million out of the 18.6 million bitcoins mined over the blockchain network's 12-year history are ""either lost or being HODLed long term,"" Glassnode says. That means new buyers coming in, such as big investors or companies looking to use the cryptocurrency as a hedge against potential inflation, would have to compete for the remaining 4 million or so bitcoins still circulating.      ""When combined with the general decrease in bitcoin's liquid supply and the number of lost coins, this leads to an even more limited supply, which is helping BTC maintain the highest prices it has ever seen,"" the analysts wrote.      - Bradley Keoun    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin remains locked in a narrowing price range despite resurgent institutional demand.      The top cryptocurrency has charted a symmetrical triangle over the past few days, as seen on the hourly chart. It's a sign both buyers and sellers are unwilling to lead the price action.      Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the biggest publicly traded crypto investment trust, purchased a total of 16,244 BTC ($607 million) on Monday, taking out 18 times more supply from the market than what miners added. This was after the trust reopened last week following a month-long pause and quickly accumulated another 4,700 BTC. (Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.)      Even so, the cryptocurrency is struggling to gather upside traction. The bulls look to be taking a hiatus, having engineered a rally of more than 200% over the past three months.      Digital-asset traders appear to have shifted toward alternative cryptocurrencies such as ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, which rose to a new record high early Tuesday.      The focus could move back to bitcoin if the largest cryptocurrency breaks out of its hourly chart triangle pattern. That would imply a resumption of the broader trend and put $50,000 on the map, as noted by Vinny Lingham, investor and founder of crypto wallet and identity verification firm Civic.      - Omkar Godbole      Read More: Bitcoin Becomes Most-Crowded Trade in Bank of America Survey After Passing ‘Long Tech’    Token watch    Enjin (ENJ): Enjin Coin becomes first gaming cryptocurrency whitelisted for use in Japan (CoinDesk)      Tether (USDT): Anonymous columnist questions whether Tether's true peg is distorted by promotional awards (Medium)      Celsius (CEL): Alex Mashinsky, CEO of crypto lender Celsius, says in interview that company filed SEC exemption form on CEL tokens ""because the regulations are not clear"" (CoinDesk)      XRP (XRP): Kraken exchange becomes latest to halt XRP trading for U.S. residents after SEC suit against Ripple Labs (CoinDesk)    What's Hot    Goldman Sachs reportedly planning to enter crypto market soon with custody play (CoinDesk)      Huobi Global connects to European banking system via UK's BCB Group (CoinDesk)      Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange, hounded by snarky social-media comments about reliability, plans improvements to infrastructure (CoinDesk)      CoinShares starts exchange-traded bitcoin product (Bloomberg)      MetLife's investment arm predicts ""true central bank digital-currency launch among Western countries seems unlikely to occur anytime soon"" (CoinDesk)      Bitcoin takes over as ""most-crowded trade"" in Bank of America survey after passing ""long tech"" (CoinDesk)      ""No, bitcoin is not in a bubble,"" CoinDesk Research Director Noelle Acheson writes in Crypto Long & Short newsletter (CoinDesk)      JPMorgan analysts see $40,000 as a key bitcoin price threshold before bullish uptrend continues, Bloomberg reports (CoinDesk)      Former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, in interview, lists bitcoin among U.S. dollar alternatives that could make inroads as an international reserve asset (CoinDesk)      Wall Street chief financial officers (CFO) are more wary of putting company funds into bitcoin after last week’s 30% price plunge (CoinDesk)      Bitcoin is ""two bets in one: a sound, unimpeachable monetary protocol and the reserve asset for a rapidly expanding crypto-financial network,"" Castle Island Ventures' Nic Carter writes (New York Magazine)      South Korea's Dunamu launches its own bitcoin ""fear and greed"" index (CoinDesk):    Analogs  The latest on the economy and traditional finance    Biden Treasury secretary nominee (and former Federal Reserve Chair) Janet Yellen says in prepared remarks for Tuesday's confirmation hearing that ""with interest rates at historic lows, the smartest thing we can do is act big"" (FT)      Jamie Dimon says JPMorgan Chase should absolutely be ""scared s---less"" about threat from fintech rivals, names PayPal, Square, Stripe, Ant Financial, Amazon, Apple, Google (CNBC)      Beleaguered U.S. bank Wells Fargo targets $8B in cost savings over three years, including job cuts, and considers options for exiting asset-management and corporate-trust businesses (Pensions & Investments)      Foreign investors expect U.S. dollar to remain weak under Biden (WSJ)      U.S. corporate bond spreads shrink to 0.93 percentage point, narrowest since January 2020, at least partly reflecting investor confidence in ongoing economic stimulus and easy money from the Federal Reserve (WSJ)      Reserve Bank of Australia could shut down quantitative easing program in April (Australian Financial Review)      China's GDP grew 2.3% in 2020, lowest lowest in 44 years (Nikkei Asia Review)      Taiwanese chip maker startup Kneron eyes global expansion, aims for 8x growth in 2021 as U.S. blacklists hit Chinese rivals (Nikkei Asia Review)      Southeast Asian ride-hailing company Grab considers U.S. IPO estimated at $2B (Reuters)    Tweet of the day",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole, Sebastian Sinclair",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/19/first-mover-ethereum-steals-limelight-with-new-all-time-high-price-as-bitcoiners-hodl,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/52882c8573ae4f49680c93f72c76590026d258f1-1943x1388.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385667,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB5xFt,1611059313,"Ethereum's Ether Cryptocurrency Sets New All-Time Price High Near $1,440","The price of ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain network, soared to record levels earlier on Tuesday.      Prices hit $1,439.33 around 12:00 UTC – that's a little over the previous all-time high of $1,432.88 registered on CoinDesk's price index on Jan. 13, 2018. The digital asset rallied nearly 12% Tuesday to reach the new peak.      Ether first hinted at a coming rally to previously unseen levels earlier this month, but fell victim to a brief market correction triggered by bitcoin's pullback from $40,000 to $30,000 last week.      The cryptocurrency has topped its previous bull market peak nearly two months after bitcoin surpassed its December 2017 record price to hit a new high above $41,900 earlier this month.      While ether has trailed bitcoin in its journey to new lifetime highs, it has outpaced the top cryptocurrency on a year-to-date basis with a 92% gain. Bitcoin has risen 27% so far this year.      Ether is also up well over 1,000% since the initial public sale of ETH in 2015, according to Messari.    Ethereum’s value proposition    Ethereum is a blockchain for decentralized applications (dapps) such as prediction markets or trading venues. Dapps operate similarly to regular applications, but inherit features of blockchain-based technologies such as censorship resistance.      The Ethereum blockchain was co-founded and originally described by Russian-Canadian developer Vitalik Buterin, who remains the project’s most well-known personality.      Decentralized finance (DeFi) is widely regarded as the best Ethereum use case to date. DeFi markets enable permissionless and automated lending, trading and borrowing to anyone with an internet connection. The market recently surpassed some $22 billion in total value locked (TVL) – a metric similar to assets under management (AUM).      Read more: The Smart Way to Talk About DeFi’s $22B      DeFi applications typically have their own tokens as well, generally based on Ethereum. That market has enjoyed a second bull run of its own following surging popularity this past summer.    Ethereum 2.0    In the long run, Ethereum proponents are positioning the blockchain project to be a censorship-resistant base layer operating in the background of tomorrow’s internet. This concept is generally referred to as Web 3.0, and will knit today’s social networks with integral money systems.      Read more: Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain Goes Live as ‘World Computer’ Begins Long-Awaited Overhaul      Ethereum took a significant step towards this goal on Dec. 1 with the release of a new blockchain, the Beacon Chain, which brought in staking – pledging funds to support the network, rather than mining. That upgrade is part one of three in a series of transitions to upgrade the current Ethereum network towards a blockchain capable of handling an entire financial system.

NHS facilities in the U.K.’s South Warwickshire, Stratford Upon Avon and Warwick hospitals region will be using the technology initially, with a wider rollout planned as vaccine distribution progresses.  The vaccines need to be kept well below freezing in order to prevent spoiling, so accurate monitoring is essential.  “As we begin to prepare the roll out of these new COVID-19 vaccines, with the specific temperature requirements, we recognize the importance of utilizing their same tracking and monitoring capabilities,” said Steve Clarke, electro biomedical engineering manager at South Warwickshire NHS, in the announcement.

Published by Reuters on Tuesday, the research is evidence of the growing popularity of bitcoin as an investment asset. Widely touted as a digital gold and an inflation hedge, the leading cryptocurrency by market value has rallied by over 230% in the past three months on the back of institutional demand. Prices clocked record highs above $41,900 earlier this month.      According to the survey, bitcoin has dethroned ""long tech"" (bullish bets on major technology companies) as the most crowded trade – that is, the one seeing the most capital inflow. The news marks the first time long tech has been pushed off the top position since October.      Meanwhile, betting against the U.S. dollar (""short USD"") is now the third most popular trade.      The battered U.S. dollar has regained some poise in recent days, tracking a rise in the U.S. Treasury yields. The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback's value, is currently seen at 90.50, up 1.4% from the multi-year low of 89.21 seen on Jan. 6. The minor bounce may have helped put the brakes on bitcoin's bull run.

According to a press release shared to CoinDesk on Tuesday, ENJ has been given the official nod by the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA), the country's self-regulatory body overseeing cryptocurrency exchanges.      The token is expected to be listed on Japan's Coincheck exchange on Jan. 26, meaning users will be able to purchase ENJ with Japanese yen.      ENJ is a store of value token that gets locked into non-fungible tokens (NFTs) when created by users within the Enjin gaming and app ecosystem. Those NFTs can be traded, swapped and integrated cross platform with the potential to create entirely new in-app economies, according to the company.      “From Super Mario to Pokémon and Final Fantasy, Japan is home to pioneering games that hold a lasting place in pop culture,” said Enjin CEO Maxim Blagov. ""We believe some of the world’s best blockchain games will come from the Japanese gaming industry.""      Coincheck is one of Japan's largest licensed cryptocurrency marketplaces and is regulated by the country's Financial Services Agency (FSA).      According to the FSA's history of cryptocurrency listings, ENJ is the first in the gaming category to be listed on an exchange within the country.      Enjin, the company behind ENJ, entered the Japanese market in 2019 partnering with Tokyo-based blockchain accelerator HashPort that sought to bring Enjin's platform to the country's games market. That's also the time when the two firms collaborated to push for ENJ's regulatory approval from the JVCEA to be listed on exchanges, according to the press statement.      See also: Microsoft Marketing Exec Joins Blockchain Gaming Platform Enjin to Lead Enterprise Push      “Enjin made a bold commitment entering the Japanese market in 2019, determined to grow [its] business in the space regardless of market conditions,"" said HashPort's CEO Seihaku Yoshida. ""After more than a year of due diligence, the approval and listing of Enjin Coin on Coincheck is an important milestone for Enjin and adoption of its blockchain platform in Japan.”      At press time, ENJ is changing hands for $0.30, up 27% over 24 hours and 71% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap.",POSITIVE,ENJ,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | ENJ | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/01/19/enjin-coin-becomes-first-gaming-cryptocurrency-whitelisted-for-use-in-japan,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/00f41312da39c16147fec4310dd162a1f31f0c92-1500x925.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a report by Bloomberg on Monday, unless bitcoin's price can break out above $40,000 the cryptocurrency could see further downside.      Greater input from the multibillion-dollar bitcoin trust owned by digital asset manager Grayscale Investments is needed to sustain prices above that key level, according to JPMorgan's strategists and Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, its global market strategy head. The analysis also took into account demand for bitcoin futures. Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk's parent company.      The bearish outlook would likely be triggered by a bevy of traders exiting the market on a potential change in the short-term trend and a lack of further institutional flows, according to the report.      ""The flow into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust would likely need to sustain its $100 million per day pace over the coming days and weeks for such a breakout to occur,” strategists said in a note to investors on Friday referring to a price breach above $40,000.      Grayscale announced on Saturday it had raised its largest single-day raise in the firm's existence, adding above $700 million to its family of products including bitcoin.      How long the digital asset manager can sustain those levels remains unclear.      The analysts said bitcoin is now in a similar position to November 2020 when the cryptocurrency was toying with a move toward $20,000. On Dec. 16, bitcoin did pass $20,000, which the JPMorgan analysts attributed to Grayscale's involvement in the market.      Traders “could propagate the past week’s correction,” JPMorgan's analysts also said, referring to the sharp over-20% drop in bitcoin's value on Jan. 10, before a partial recovery prompted by opportunists.      See also: Long-Desired Bitcoin ETF Could Actually Hurt Price in Short Term: JPMorgan      If bitcoin fails to retake $40,000, “momentum signals will naturally decay from here up till the end of March,” the analysts said in the report.
