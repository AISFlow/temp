42376237,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwL5Wt,1608245201,"Sure, Bitcoin’s Price Is Cool, but Bitcoin’s Technology Is Hot","Bitcoin is back in the news.  As a wave of institutional liquidity pours into Bitcoin’s markets, even some of its staunchest critics are finding it hard to dismiss the 12-year-old asset as its price surges to new all-time highs.  At the very least, these past three years have proven that Bitcoin is certainly not dead. At the most, it gives credence to the investment thesis of its most bullish proponents: that it is one of the most revolutionary technologies of its time.  But what makes bitcoin so unlike any other investment (or cryptocurrency) that blue-chip insurance funds, hedge funds and asset managers are now comfortable with buying it?  Read more: Over $20K? Why Is Bitcoin Worth Anything at All?  Bitcoin is a synthesis of decades of cryptographic technology and research with numerous precursors and false starts that predate it. For all of its predecessors, Bitcoin was the first attempt at digital cash that laid out a (more or less) completely decentralized system.  For those of you who are new, here’s what that means and the technical features that make bitcoin such a standout.  Fact #1: Bitcoin is cryptographic money  Contrary to common misconception, Bitcoin transactions aren’t kept secret or encrypted – in fact, they’re quite public.  But Bitcoin's system is built on public-key cryptography, a branch of computer science that uses complex math (via a system of digital keys) to encode data and keep it hidden from those who don’t have the right key to decode it.  Read more: What Is Bitcoin?  With Bitcoin, users have a public key (from which they can create public addresses to receive bitcoin) and a private key; as their names suggest, the former is meant to be shared while the latter must be kept secret (if revealed, your bitcoin can be stolen, but more on that later).  The private key is what gives you a claim to the bitcoin you own. Technically speaking, wallets store private keys and not ""bitcoin."" Every bitcoin exists on the blockchain – wallets just hold the keys that give users access to them.  You need your private key to approve transactions, and you need someone else's public address to send a transaction.  If you’re familiar with PGP encryption, you may see how Bitcoin transactions are similar. The same principles that make encrypted communications so secure are baked into Bitcoin's code, except instead of messages, Bitcoin's design secures the bitcoin currency.  Factoid: Bitcoin with a capital ""B"" refers to the Bitcoin technology or protocol. We use bitcoin with a lowercase ""b"" when we are referring to the digital currency.  Like sending an encrypted message, Bitcoin transactions are peer-to-peer and (because of the mining process, which we'll cover later) they can’t be obstructed by anyone.  Fact #2: Bitcoin is permissionless and censorship resistant  Because bitcoin can be sent as freely as a message, Bitcoin is inclusive.  When Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin's creator, designed the system, he made it ""permissionless,"" meaning anyone can use Bitcoin to hold and transfer value. He also designed it to be “censorship resistant,” meaning no one can block you from joining the network and making transactions. Nobody can freeze the funds in your wallet, and no one can stop you from making a transaction with Bitcoin.  Because of the way bitcoin transactions are processed, no central party has control over your payments. Unlike PayPal, Venmo, or any other electronic transfer, bitcoin payments are made directly between the payer and recipient, thanks to the cryptography we touched on above.  The foundation of this system, Bitcoin Core, is an open source software which is an all-in-one wallet and server for the Bitcoin network. Anyone with the proper hardware can download and run Bitcoin’s software; it keeps a copy of the Bitcoin blockchain's transaction ledger and broadcasts transactions to other servers in the network.  “Running a full node,” as this is called, is the ultimate exercise in Bitcoin control because you can fully audit the Bitcoin ledger yourself and broadcast your own transactions.  Even without running a full node, Bitcoin users can use the network at their will when they use a wallet that lets them control their own private keys, though this means that they are trusting someone else’s network node to broadcast their transactions for them.  Fact #3: Bitcoin transactions are forever  The Bitcoin blockchain – the digital ledger which stores a record of all the network's transactions – is immutable. It cannot be altered by a central party, and nobody can cheat the network to spend coins they don’t own.  Bitcoin transactions are processed into the ledger by a global network of ""miners,"" individuals and collectives who run machines to “mine” (maintain) the Bitcoin blockchain. Miners receive bitcoin as a reward for mining in the form of a “block reward,” a payout that goes to the miner(s) who finds the next block in the blockchain’s sequence and records the latest pending transactions in it.  Read more: How Do Bitcoin Transactions Work?  If you've know anything about mining, you probably know that it requires *a lot* of energy because mining competition is fierce. When you take bitcoin's price into account, this makes sense – they're not giving these things away for free!  This competition and energy expenditure helps secure the network. Miners are incentivized to process transactions and not interfere with the transaction ledger – otherwise, they risk their payday and, in the case of the big mining firms, tens of millions of dollars in hardware and operational expenses.  If a miner did want to cheat, the only way to alter Bitcoin transactions that have been recorded in the blockchain is to perform more work than roughly half of all other miners in the network – and the older the transaction, the longer you will have to work. To give you an idea of how much energy you’d need to attack Bitcoin, the network annually consumes, on average, as much electricity as a nation the size of Austria or Switzerland.  Read more: How Bitcoin Mining Works  So altering a transaction from, say, three years ago would require several hundreds of millions of dollars. Rollbacks are not theoretically impossible, but when you factor in the cost to mine with Bitcoin mining's decentralization, they're highly improbable (and have never happened in Bitcoin's existence).  Fact #4: Bitcoin is (practically) unconfiscatible  Of course, bitcoin can be stolen or seized if you're not careful.  But if you take the right precautions, you can make your coins practically impervious to seizure, because so long as you keep your private key (or, the password that controls your bitcoin) in your custody and away from the eyes of others,your coins are in your complete control.  Read more: Unconfiscatable? Using Bitcoin to Resist Police Extortion in Nigeria  For increased security, you can set up ""multi-signature"" wallets that distribute access to your funds across multiple devices. Some wallets even include safety features like dummy passwords you can enter to show a blank account if you are at risk of being extorted, for example.  You can even memorize your private key in the form of a 12-to-24 word seed phrase, destroy the wallet associated with it, and store your bitcoin in your brain. When you want to access them again, you can download just about any Bitcoin wallet (all the good ones support these “seed phrases”), plug your seed phrase in, and you can access the bitcoin in your ""brainwallet.”  You can also store your seed phrase on a piece of paper or (more to the taste of hardcore Bitcoiners) on metal sheets to protect them from the elements, or you can encrypt it on a USB drive and store it in an airgapped laptop – a computer that is never connected to the internet.  It’s even possible to send a bitcoin transaction without being connected to the internet via satellites and mesh networks.  Read more: GoTenna Partners With Blockstream Satellite to Make Using Bitcoin Without an Internet Connection Simpler  Fact #5: Bitcoin is a decentralized, digital monetary system  Bitcoin is both a peer-to-peer payment network and a personal digital bank. Its economy is driven by consumers who purchase bitcoin, miners who process transactions and mint new bitcoin for circulation, node operators who audit the network and broadcast transactions, businesses who build on bitcoin and everyone in between.  This economy is also self-regulated. Every four years, a self-executing mechanism cuts the number of bitcoin that is minted via mining in half. This reward will eventually dwindle until the last bitcoin is mined over one hundred years from now. This “halving cycle” ensures that Bitcoin’s supply will never exceed 21 million and makes its inflation rate predictable.  Satoshi Nakamoto titled the Bitcoin white paper ""Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System."" In the strictest since, Bitcoin *is* digital cash that you can spend as freely as physical cash, but some have taken this branding by Bitcoin's creator as a signal that bitcoin is primarily meant to be used as a currency.  Bitcoin can be used this way, and new scaling technologies like the Lightning Network are providing infrastructure to process these transactions in faster, cheaper ways.  Read more: What Is Bitcoin’s Lightning Network?  But Bitcoin doesn’t care what you use it for, ultimately. Companies including Square and MicroStrategy are using it as a treasury for their company's savings. At the same time, everything that makes Bitcoin censorship resistant and permissionless makes it an attractive donation source for dissidents protesting abusive governments, or a financial lifeline for citizens living in financially sanctioned (and economically battered) countries.  Yes, Bitcoin's technology makes it attractive for criminals, but that's only a small fraction of the network's real users. (Criminals use cash, too, after all!) And since all bitcoin transactions are public, sometimes it's easier than not to pin illicit transactions on their transactors. Of course, there are also privacy-preserving technologies to make your blockchain footprint less traceable.  Bitcoin's core technology is rooted in principles of user freedom and financial liberty. Branching from this is a plethora of softwares, wallets, protocols and other dodads that developers are working on to make bitcoin more functional and sustainable for the long haul.

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $22,818 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 9% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $20,756-$23,770 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC below its 10-hour moving average but well above the 50-hour on the hourly chart, a bullish-to-sideways signal for market technicians.    The price of bitcoin continued its rise to all-time highs, going up to $23,770 as of press time in a highly bullish run that had lots of volume-fueled momentum.      Read More: Bitcoin Drops Nearly 7% After Setting New Record High of $23,770      The $23,800 level may be a spot of exhaustion for the world’s oldest cryptocurrency, according to Constantin Kogan, partner at financial firm Wave Financial. “There’s some strong selling resistance at $23,800. Let's see if bitcoin can break it,” Kogan told CoinDesk.      Volumes on Thursday were higher than on Wednesday, with the eight major exchanges tracked by the CoinDesk 20 seeing over $3.5 billion in volume so far as of press time versus $2.9 billion the day previous.      “Breaking the $20,000 psychological barrier was a strong bullish signal allowing bitcoin to set a new record high,” said Elie Le Rest, partner at crypto quant trading firm ExoAlpha. However, Le Rest cautioned about crypto’s classic gyrations possibly affecting the market. “Volatility is very high and small pullbacks have been witnessed along the way.”      Indeed, bitcoin’s 30-day volatility has been picking up and will be something to watch over the balance of December.      “Traders should be careful and on the lookout for stronger pullbacks, especially with year-end approaching and traders looking to close their 2020 profit-and-loss,” added LeRest.      Chris Thomas, head of digital assets Swissquote Bank concurred, saying the most recent move feels too strong for his taste. “I’m just waiting for a few big sellers to come back to the market and take profits,” Thomas said. “Let’s look ahead to the next few weeks. Institutional volumes will drop significantly through Christmas so the market will be driven by retail until early January.”      “This should cause us to keep the high volatility, but we’ve got to also be aware there may be a chance of testing $20,000 to the downside,” added Thomas.      Read More: Coinbase Files With SEC in Preparation for Landmark Public Offering      Henrik Kugelberg, a crypto over-the-counter trader, noted “fear of missing out” or FOMO as a factor playing into the market’s fervor. “There is of course an element of FOMO in this but the fundamentals are stable as pyramids,” Kugelberg said. “I have said $30,000 before summer but by the looks of this, that might be a very low bid.”    Ethereum network locked value at all-time high    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH) was up Thursday trading around $640 and climbing 2.7% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      The amount of crypto “locked” in decentralized finance, or DeFi, is at $16 billion as of press time, increasing over 2,200% from the $690 million locked at the start of 2020.      Meanwhile, the amount of ether locked in DeFi is going up, over 7.1 million ETH total.      Yet the amount of bitcoin locked in DeFi has actually fallen during the market’s price run, down to 142,652 BTC.      Nicholas Pelecanos, head of trading for blockchain ecosystem provider NEM, told CoinDesk many investors continue to overlook the Ethereum network and its alternative assets, also known as altcoins.      “While bitcoin has largely dominated the narrative, I believe investors should look to altcoins that have tremendous amounts of development in both the core technology and usership, yet are still a fair way off their all-time highs,” said Pelecanos. “I am expecting to see the price of these altcoins, such as ETH and XEM, rally hard when the BTC price inevitably slows down.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly green Thursday. Notable winners as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET):    xrp (XRP) + 14%  litecoin (LTC) + 13%  stellar (XLM) + 5.5%    In addition, prices for COMP, the governance token for the Ethereum-based lending protocol Compound, jumped on the news that Compound Labs will build a new blockchain to provide money market services across multiple networks.      As CoinDesk reported, the new blockchain could be significant because those new supported assets won’t be limited to blockchains – it is designed to also support the forthcoming and rumored central bank digital currencies.

42433370,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQOLh,1608238175,FCA Registration U-Turn Still Leaves Costs for UK Startups,"The U.K. financial services regulator admitted defeat this week in its effort to register all of the country’s crypto-asset firms by Jan. 10, too late for firms that already racked up costs preparing for that deadline while they awaited registration.      Back in January 2020, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced that no firm would be allowed to engage in ""crypto-asset activity"" in the U.K. after Jan. 10, 2021, unless it was registered. But with less than a month until that date, the FCA’s website only lists four registered firms, of which two are subsidiaries of Gemini. Zero new registrations have been processed in the last three months.      On Dec. 16, the FCA backed down by emailing more than 100 unregistered applicants that it “may not be able to complete the assessment by 9 January.” Those firms have been granted temporary registration until July 9, 2021. In the email, the FCA emphasized their applications had still not been processed and they had not been assessed as “fit and proper.”      By leaving it so late to back down, the FCA raised the fear that a large number of firms would have to stop trading temporarily in January. That forced firms to accept now-unnecessary expenses to prepare to protect themselves from that outcome.      “We would lose all of our client base,” said the boss of an over-the-counter crypto trading desk based in Mayfair, London, who asked to remain anonymous, “something which we probably couldn’t recover from.”      For the sole purpose of preparing for this possibility, he “had a parallel offshore structure set-up and was arranging an appointed agent for the U.K."" The costs of these measures stretched into six figures.    By leaving it so late to back down, the FCA raised the fear that a large number of firms would have to stop trading temporarily in January.    As late as Dec. 1, the FCA still actively stood by its January deadline. It refused to respond to any questions for this article except to comment: “We are working hard to process applications before the 10 January 2021 deadline and continue to review our progress as this date approaches.”      Even though digital asset custody service Copper, also based in London’s Mayfair, submitted its application more than nine months ago, marketing director Tyler Kenyon says the company is still involved in a slow dialogue with the FCA. There have been long periods of “radio silence” in the meantime, punctuated by occasional fresh questions.      Cryptocurrency brokerage BC Bitcoin also applied promptly and diligently. It, too, has made sure to meet the FCA’s requirements, according to sales manager Tyler Smith, but has received no verdict on its application.      Kenyon says he feels some sympathy for the FCA because his understanding is the Treasury – the U.K.’s finance ministry – was responsible for setting the January deadline. The coronavirus pandemic might have caused certain delays. On top of that, he suspects FCA staff has had to learn about the crypto asset sector on the job and on the clock. This could be why some applicants are being asked for up to 80 documents and three-hour interviews, to the surprise of seasoned compliance consultants.      The FCA has kept some interested groups in the loop about its slow progress. According to people with access to that communication, the regulator received 160 applications. It admits it does not know how many firms should have applied except that the number might be several hundred. That implies it does not know how many firms could be flouting its rules by continuing to trade after July next year. It also refused to say what would happen to firms that did so.      FCA blamed its slow progress on the poor standard of applications. Less-experienced firms may have underestimated the complexity of regulatory requirements. London-based financial services regulatory consultancy Bovill comments that these cover “the business plan, organizational charts, IT arrangements … policies and procedures as well as governance provisions.” Copper’s Kenyon says that some probably thought it would be a tick-box exercise, but they were wrong.      Firms and regulators alike are having to contend with a real and major threat of money laundering and other illicit activity. “It is safe to say that there is a relatively high inherent risk of money laundering in the virtual asset space,” according to Bovill. Rapid growth has brought its own risks, too. Firms that expand quickly can find themselves facing compliance responsibilities for which they were not prepared.      See also: UK FCA Grants Crypto Firms Temporary Registration as It Deals With Applications Backlog      But if this explains the FCA’s failure to approve more than four of the robust applications, it only means that conscientious firms were forced to take costly precautions as the deadline loomed just because of the shortcomings of their peers.      The FCA finally granted the temporary registrations and effectively extended the deadline because of the magnitude of the damage it would do by forcing legitimate crypto-asset businesses to suspend trading. Copper’s Kenyon speculates about the impact of a temporary stop: “The knock-on effects would be substantial, because a lot of firms rely on our infrastructure.”      The boss of the Mayfair over-the-counter (OTC) desk explains a temporary halt would have necessitated redundancies in the short term followed by expensive recruiting later on. The impact on client relationships would probably have ended the business.      That company is keeping its costly precautions in place in case of “any more speed bumps” with the registration process going forward.      Unless the FCA accelerates its progress significantly in the coming months, the U.K.’s crypto-asset firms could face another tense countdown next summer – or another regulatory U-turn.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TRADING,Benedict George,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/12/17/fca-registration-u-turn-still-leaves-costs-for-uk-startups,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7633072470b7317a2e9c4aa5ed06c1d3b4034082-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421911,hikHVzJcuiWb3s4YOvN3Wl,1608235369,Compound's New Blockchain Readies DeFi for Central Bank Digital Currencies,"Compound Labs released a white paper Thursday detailing its plans to create Compound Chain, an application-specific blockchain that can provide money market services across multiple networks.      ""We want to announce the designs for a blockchain that can scale Compound over the next century,"" Compound founder Robert Leshner told CoinDesk on a phone call. The decentralized finance (DeFi) firm isn't committing to a timeline yet but it is at work on a testnet now.      The new white paper, a draft of which was shared with CoinDesk in advance, authored by Leshner and Compound Labs staffers Geoffrey Hayes, Jared Flatow and Max Wolff, cites three limitations of the current version of Compound on Ethereum: gas costs, inability to serve assets on other chains and the fact that all supported assets aggregate the risk of each supported asset.      Those new supported assets aren't envisioned to be limited to blockchains of the trustless, permissionless variety either. The new project is meant to support the forthcoming and rumored digital assets from central banks and investment banks.      The white paper states:    ""Compound Chain is a reimagination of the Compound Protocol as a stand-alone distributed ledger, capable of solving these limitations and proactively preparing for the rapid adoption & growth of digital assets on a variety of new blockchains, including Eth2 and central bank digital currency ledgers.""    Compound Chain joins the chorus of blockchain interoperability efforts, but it's somewhat unique in that it's attempting to do so in an application-specific way. Not many similar attempts have preceded it, though Leshner did credit the stablecoin and payments chain, Terra (which just added synthetic equities), as one of them.      While this is an entirely new and standalone blockchain, it will be governed by the same Ethereum-based system that runs Compound v1 – the COMP token. Once the Compound Chain goes live, this will be a considerable new set of powers accruing to COMP owners.      Within an hour of the product's announcement, COMP surged by as much as 10% in price, according to Messari data.    CASH    While the Compound Chain will be governed by COMP – the token that spurred the yield farming craze over the summer – it also introduces a new cryptocurrency called CASH.      Compound Chain's native CASH token will be used to pay for transactions on the network. CASH will be minted in much the same way as DAI, as a debt against locked collateral held on the Compound Chain.      Like DAI, CASH will start arbitrarily pegged to the U.S. dollar, but its peg can be changed by governance decisions. Unlike DAI, all CASH will earn some kind of yield from a portion of interest paid against loans originated on the blockchain. The precise amount will be one of many parameters determined by COMP holders who participate in governance votes.      The whole purpose of the chain is to function like Compound but in a cross-blockchain fashion.    A new interoperability play    As soon as an asset is uploaded to Compound Chain, it's available for lending to others. It's up to users if they want to borrow against their assets or not.      As on Compound, they will be able to borrow any supported asset but they will also be able to borrow assets, starting with CASH, that are unique to the Compound Chain.      Compound Chain should ship ready to support Ethereum. As for the next chains to be integrated, ""This is really up to the community,"" Leshner said. ""I suspect the first additional chains would be things like Solana and Polkadot and Tezos.""      The only real prerequisite is the blockchain needs to be able to support smart contracts. The smart contracts for moving assets between Compound and smart contract chains are referred to as ""starports.""      While this might be seen as a major break from Ethereum to some, the chain that kicked off DeFi will continue to maintain control of the new chain, at least for now.      As the white paper explains, ""The Compound Governance system on Ethereum established a distributed decision-making process, and is capable of streaming governance actions to the Ethereum starport, which Compound Chain validators receive instructions from.""      Further, Leshner expects those who are long Ethereum will see an advantage to incorporating other chains, because it will enable Ethereum to port value created on other chains into the world computer's DeFi applications, in the form of CASH.      The chain can also mint new assets, but early users' ability to upload assets from other blockchains will likely be seen as more important. Assets will be uploaded by moving the asset into a smart contract on layer-one chains (such as Ethereum or Cosmos), which the Compound Chain validators will witness and then mint on the corresponding Compound Chain wallet.    Details pending    Compound Labs has not indicated what technology it will be built on at this point, only that it will use a proof-of-authority architecture. All the parameters will be set through governance decisions of the participating COMP holders.      Proof-of-authority is similar to proof-of-stake in some ways, but it's important to point out that all validators are selected by COMP holders. ""If you can appoint malicious validators, it's the same as being able to steal all the funds in Compound,"" Leshner said.      Proof-of-authority is just the launch setup. ""Governance can remove itself and switch to a fully open proof-of-stake system,"" Leshner said, though he doesn't expect it will for some time.      The main intent appears to be to broaden DeFi into all parts of the crypto ecosystem.      ""The Compound Chain is designed from the ground up to enable bridging value between its connected 'peer' chains,"" the white paper states.      Some of those peer chains may be more cumberbund classical (see: CBDCs) than punk rock, but therein lies the opportunity for a company like Compound Labs.      The team there is already looking at new business lines that could be enabled by the new chain. For example, certain centralized digital currencies, such as jpm coin, may require known liquidators who have been through compliance checks. This could be a role the team behind Compound could play,for certain more-restricted assets.      ""At launch, the goal is to replicate the user experience of Compound but with a really clear path to be able to support every blockchain and every asset,"" Leshner said.

On Thursday, the major cryptocurrency exchange filed preliminary documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).      Coinbase has been the subject of IPO speculation for months. But the timing, coming just one day after bitcoin broke $20,000 for the first time ever, cannot be ignored. The major exchange is positioning itself as Wall Street’s most accessible bet yet on cryptocurrency.  In October 2018, Coinbase was valued at $8 billion. Given the stratospheric increase in the price of bitcoin since then and the recent demand for initial public offerings, it's expected Coinbase's current valuation will be significantly higher.      ""The Form S-1 is expected to become effective after the SEC completes its review process, subject to market and other conditions,"" the firm wrote in a sparse blog post.      Coinbase said it filed confidentially with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That’s the first formal step on the long road to a public offering. The document, which likely includes target raise, was not available at press time.      A Coinbase spokesman declined to comment further.      The company’s influence touches all corners of the cryptocurrency industry. It is a major hub for retail bitcoin trading and a gateway for alternative cryptocurrencies. Its institutional business is growing faster than MicroStrategy’s sats pile. It has an analytics team, a stablecoin in partnership with Circle, a ventures wing and a commerce department.      All of that could appeal to a Wall Street class eager for exposure to the cryptocurrency markets.      It’s unclear whether Coinbase is looking to go public via an IPO or a direct listing. Coinbase was first rumored to be exploring a stock market listing in July 2020, when Reuters reported it had begun the process of taking its shares public. Unnamed sources told the wire service at the time that Coinbase was looking at a direct listing, rather than an initial public offering.      Both IPOs and direct listings require form S-1s, according to a blog post from Andreessen Horowitz, a key Coinbase investor.      The form Coinbase filed is confidential, meaning its contents won’t be made public until three weeks prior to the exchange’s roadshow, when the firm tries to woo potential investors.      This story will be updated.      Zack Seward and Nikhilesh De contributed reporting.

42421929,hikHVzJcuiWb3s4YOvN4Tz,1608227665,Uncharted Territory: How Technical Analysts Are Trading Bitcoin at All-Time Highs,"Bitcoin's bull run appears to be in full swing amid a broader consensus that 2021 could bring more significant gains. The question now for market participants is how high the cryptocurrency could go and, conversely, which levels could act as support levels or potential entry points for investors looking to buy.      For long-term investors, continuing to ""HODL"" coins and trusting forecasts for a bitcoin price rally to over $100,000 by prominent observers is a fairly straightforward way to play the market. Yet, short-term speculators and leverage traders, who rely more on technical analysis to identify price targets, resistance and support levels, may find it difficult to keep doing what they've been doing without previous price levels to provide obvious guideposts.      That's because bitcoin's latest move above $20,000 has pushed the cryptocurrency into uncharted territory. As the top cryptocurrency has never been traded above $20,000 before, there are no ""higher price lows"" or ""lower price highs"" that could be considered potential bull/bear targets or support/resistance levels.      In such a situation, Fibonacci extensions and retracements can help identify key price levels, according to William Noble, a chief market technician at Token Metrics.    Fib extensions reveal $26,000 as the next target    The $26,000 level ""is the 38.2% extension of the move from the March bottom to November highs around $19,000,"" Noble told CoinDesk during a Zoom interview on Wednesday. ""That's the first target for bitcoin.""      If prices break above $26,000, the focus would shift to the 61.8% extension at $29,822. According to Noble, the 76% extension at $32,000 could act as resistance or serve as a potential price target.      The Fibonacci extension for an uptrend is drawn by joining three points – the lowest price or the point of origin of the bull trend, a major price high, and the low of subsequent pullback bounce. That will generate Fibonacci extension levels of 23.6%; 38.2%, 50.0%, 61.8%.      Meanwhile, the Fibonacci retracement on an uptrend is drawn by connecting the low and high points to get 23.6%, 38.2%, and 61.8% retracement levels.      These percentages are based on the Fibonacci sequence – a series of numbers beginning from 0 and arranged so that any particular number of the series is simply the summation of the previous two numbers. For instance, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377 and so on.      A closer look at the sequence tells us that every number gets closer and closer to 61.8% of the following number. Further, every number gets closer to the 38.2% of the number two positions to its right and 23.6% of the number three positions to the right of it.      That's how retracements are calculated. Meanwhile, working the sequence in the reverse order gives extension levels. Traders don't need to know the formula or make calculations, as a charting software or platform like TradingView will do it for them.      The challenge lies in picking the most relevant price points while drawing Fibonacci extension and retracement levels. ""It's more of an art than science,"" Noble said.    Fib extensions in 2017    Fibonacci tools served the purpose in 2017 when bitcoin traded in uncharted territory for 10 months.      The cryptocurrency rose to fresh record highs above $1,200 in February and peaked at $19,783 - just above the 161.8% Fibonacci extension (extreme extension) of the move higher from January lows to November highs.      ""I've never seen anything extend that much, but it did extend 1.618 all the way up to near $20,000,"" quipped Noble, adding that ""Fibonacci extensions would have been helpful if you were buying breakouts in 2017.""      Many analysts are expecting bitcoin to chart a 2017-like meteoric rally in 2021. However, Noble believes it could play out in the coins associated with decentralized finance (DeFi).      When asked about the level to watch for during potential pullbacks, Noble said the 61.8% retracement ""might serve well in the alternative cryptocurrencies and DeFi universe coin.""    Ignore the RSI    ""The widely tracked relative strength index (RSI) and other momentum indicators like Stochastic are useful in a range trade and not necessarily in a trend,"" Noble said.      Newbies and amateur traders often misread the above-70 or overbought reading on the 14-day RSI as a sign of bearish reversal. In reality, the indicator can and does stay overbought longer than sellers can stay solvent, to paraphrase economist John Maynard Keynes.      For instance, bitcoin rallied from $11,900 to $19,000 in the four weeks leading up to Nov. 24 despite RSI signaling overbought conditions. A similar pattern was observed on the daily and weekly charts during the 2017 bull run.      ""I don't know if RSI is going to come into play until you get to one of these [Fibonacci] targets,"" Noble said. ""People are having a hard time with bitcoin's current rally because it's behaving like equities. It goes up, it sits and goes up again.""    Other tools    Traders can also use Gann fans, which are based on the idea the market is geometric and cyclical, and there are pivot points to mark support and resistance levels.      Keeping a close track of changes in the options open interest could also help identify price targets.      At press time, options at $20,000, $24,500, and $36,000 strikes show significant buildup of open interest or open positions.

42421915,hikHVzJcuiWb3s4YOvN3jv,1608226979,Nationalizing Stablecoins Won't Improve Financial Access,"If you don't have an opinion on stablecoins already, you might have to formulate one soon. Stablecoins – cryptographic tokens that aim to match the performance of sovereign currencies like the U.S. dollar – may well be the next battleground in the rapidly escalating war between the public blockchain industry and nation-states.      Bitcoin is a payments system and a set of monetary opinions, all bundled together. Many bitcoiners consider bitcoin-the-currency to have very desirable monetary properties, but it’s undeniable that the absolutely rigid supply schedule is one cause of its legendary volatility.    CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter is partner at Castle Island Ventures, a public blockchain-focused venture fund based in Cambridge, Mass. He is also the co-founder of Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics startup.    However, transacting with Bitcoin is powerful: It’s a digitally native cash instrument, meaning that transactions are final and they settle regardless of the identities of the counterparties. Transactions are reasonably (if imperfectly) private, and they do not discriminate. Anyone is free to use the system, regardless of what the state or an internet oligopoly thinks of them. Improving on physical cash, Bitcoin transactions work at a distance, as they can be broadcasted through virtually any communications medium. Yes, Bitcoin works via carrier pigeon.      The catch? You have to use bitcoin to use Bitcoin. That is, you can’t really use the settlement system without gaining at least temporary exposure to bitcoin, the currency (or asset or commodity, depending on how you want to categorize it).      It’s therefore no surprise that, for about as long as Bitcoin has existed, builders have dreamt of settling sovereign currencies on its blockchain. Stablecoins disentangle the monetary prescriptions of digital assets like bitcoin from the settlement networks on which they rely. Early experiments included Nubits and BitUSD. Even Mastercoin, the first initial coin offering (white paper published in January 2012), contained designs for a stablecoin that were later scrapped. The first successful stablecoin was tether, which owed its initial growth spurt to Bitfinex’s unstable connections to the bank system. Using tether, traders could denominate their liquidity in a crypto-native format, staying on blockchain rails even when de-risking their positions, without having to exit to the fiat system entirely. From these rather prosaic origins, Tether (the company behind the stablecoin) has grown into a behemoth, with dollar assets totaling more than $20 billion today.      See also: Nic Carter - The Crypto-Dollar Surge and the American Opportunity      It’s important to understand that fiat-backed stablecoins are simply a crypto-native wrapper for commercial bank dollars. Because public blockchains are less encumbered than established payment networks, stablecoins can cater to a wider variety of end users who might otherwise be excluded from the financial system. Outsiders often perceive stablecoins as injections of capital “into” the crypto industry. But this isn’t always the case; much of the time, the creation of stablecoins merely represents the swapping of balance sheet assets from their generic status as commercial bank IOUs into a crypto-native format.      After March 12, the issuance of stablecoins increased dramatically. And this wasn’t necessarily indicative of a capital inflow, but rather firms already active in the crypto space choosing to denominate their balance sheet in a native crypto format after a big risk-off event. Nothing changed except the way their funds were being represented.      Thus, the creation of stablecoins should be understood as the immobilization of commercial bank dollars, alongside the simultaneous creation of an equivalent cryptographic IOU. In an orderly stablecoin system, no money is being created. The representation of value is simply leaving the commercial bank system and hopping onto an alternative set of rails.      Today, a diverse set of issuers has overseen the creation of more than $25 billion worth of stablecoins. The non-Tether cohort includes issuers like the CENTRE Consortium (of which Circle and Coinbase are members), Trust Token, Paxos, Gemini and several others. These stablecoin issuers register with FinCEN, obtain money transmitter licenses on a state by state basis, maintain stable bank and audit relationships and in some cases obtain even more rigorous regulatory designations like the New York Trust Charter. Thus, descriptions of stablecoins as unregulated are erroneous. Certainly, there exist an array of business models and approaches to collateralization and redemption among them. But popular stablecoins like USDC (current circulation: $3.22 billion) are wholly accountable to U.S. financial regulators.      So why are certain U.S. policymakers, with bills like the STABLE Act, so intent on stifling the vibrant stablecoin space and forcing all activity to take place through an ill-fitting bank framework, under the watchful eye of the FDIC? It’s certainly not due to a benevolent desire to tear down the “tremendous barriers to accessing financial services and credit” faced by working-class communities, as the Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI.) press release claims.      The STABLE Act, by dramatically raising the barriers to entry for stablecoin issuers and fintechs (the authors of the bill make no distinction between stablecoins and fintech products where users maintain a balance), would make the financial services environment far less competitive. It takes some creative reasoning to deny the fact that fintech apps like Square’s (SQ) Cash App – which would be targeted by this bill because users can hold an active balance on the platform – have not been positive for financial inclusion. As Ark Invest has pointed out, the Cash App tends to be more popular in southern states where underbanked populations are most prevalent.      See also: Preston Byrne - Would the STABLE Act Make Running an Ethereum Node Illegal?      As for stablecoins, there is no denying they are a positive force for financial inclusion globally. The dollar is the world’s reserve currency, and savers worldwide covet the currency’s relative stability. By relying on a new public blockchain infrastructure, stablecoins can penetrate markets where banks refuse to participate. Venezuela is a prime example. The U.S. sanctions members of the Maduro regime but not regular citizens. But because of overly blunt approaches to de-risking, U.S. banks generally do not service clients in the country.      While Wells Fargo was busy banning Venezuelans from using Zelle, a service it jointly operates with other banks, stablecoin issuers were rushing in to give Venezuelans access to digital dollars. Juan Guaido’s administration in exile has employed the crypto app AirTm in conjunction with the USDC stablecoin (administered by Circle and Coinbase) to send dollar-denominated payments to healthcare workers in Venezuela. And other stablecoin issuers like Valiu have begun providing Venezuelans and Colombians with dollar-based financial services and remittances. Physical dollars circulate in Venezuela, but low-denomination bills are hoarded and hence hard to find. Digital dollars are more easily transmissible and link the Venezuelan diaspora (scattered throughout Latin America and the U.S.) with their families back home.      What stablecoins do is export the assurances of commercial bank dollars to a global audience, using an open and accessible payment infrastructure with strong finality assurances. Because the dollar is generally considered more credible than other sovereign currencies and tokens on public blockchains serve as digital “bearer assets,” stablecoins are popular worldwide. The more governments inflate away their local currencies or engage in monetary repression through forced devaluations or expropriation, the more citizens will look to more alternative systems of property rights.    Forcing stablecoin issuers into the ill-fitting bank template appears less motivated by a concern for the public and more by a desire for control.    The dollar is less inflationary and, when packaged as a token on-chain, it comes in a hard-to-seize format that gives savers more sovereignty. As currency crises rage in Lebanon, Turkey, Argentina and many other places, the import of foreign currencies is a life raft giving savers a free choice of currency and the option to resist the destruction of their savings. Local monetary authorities may try to resist. But, ultimately, these spontaneous dollarization events, when they do occur, tend to provide strong welfare gains for citizens in the long term. The Ecuador case study is particularly telling. The bottom-up dollarization event that took place in 2000 reined in inflation, stabilized the bank sector and brought about strong GDP growth.      Given the clear value proposition of stablecoins and the strong welfare benefits of their usage in weak monetary regimes, forcing stablecoin issuers into the ill-fitting bank template appears less motivated by a concern for the public and more by a desire for control.      Today, the politicization of financial infrastructure is all too common. Recently, the New York Times successfully initiated a financial boycott of certain adult websites. I am no fan of that industry, but I don’t believe a wholesale financial redlining is the appropriate solution to wrongdoing, which should be dealt with through our criminal justice system. Deputizing banks as extra-judicial enforcement mechanisms is an end run around the laws that govern this nation and violates the due process of affected entities.      Sharp-eyed observers will be reminded of the 2013 Operation Choke Point, which involved President Obama’s FDIC pressuring banks to deplatform disfavored industries. The firms that were extrajudicially targeted by this program were not alleged to be engaged in criminal behavior; rather, the administration leaned on banks to deplatform them simply due to political disagreements with the industries in question. While adult websites like Pornhub might fully deserve their commercial penalties driving from financial exclusion, the next firm in the crosshairs may not.      See also: JP Koning - We Don’t Need the OCC’s ‘Political Discrimination’ Rule      Initiatives like Choke Point worked because banking is a regulated oligopoly; banks serve at the pleasure of the state and must acquire extremely costly and limited charters to operate. In a free market, firms being redlined could find alternative banking partners. But banking is a semi-nationalized pursuit today, so the market cannot clear when this financial suppression occurs. Since the 1990s, banking has become much more concentrated, and average bank sizes have increased. Today, banking is an uncompetitive and tightly controlled industry. Introducing more flexible models with lower barriers to entry, like the Wyoming SPDI, or the OCC’s proposed fintech charter, would add much-needed vibrancy to the moribund system.      Indeed, most crypto entrepreneurs would welcome the application of such a charter. Many crypto businesses, stablecoins included, are not engaged in banking activity – they are not lending or transforming the maturity of deposits, as George Selgin has noted. Rather, they are custodying an asset on a fully reserved basis. One reasonable approach to the ugly patchwork of state-by-state regulations that stablecoin issuers have to reckon with would be a unified federal standard that recognizes these issuers as fully backed custodians of commercial bank dollars. A bank charter in the traditional sense would be wholly inappropriate, since stablecoin issuers do not issue loans, do not create deposits and are not engaged in money creation.      Congress should absolutely think through the implications of the popularity of stablecoins. More transparency around reserve quality would be welcome, and a federally unified model for money transmitter licenses would be a reasonable path forward. But a vanilla bank charter is a square peg in a stablecoin’s round hole.

Small caps Litecoin’s price reached three figures for the first time in 16 months earlier on Thursday. The seventh-largest cryptocurrency by market value soared to $103.19, its highest since Aug. 5, 2019, rallying more than 20% in 24 hours on bitcoin's coattails. It's now up nearly 150% year to date. The rest of the crypto market is likewise in the green.    At stake    Next fun trend (NFTs) Last year when I was helping to put together CoinDesk’s Year in Review series I kept hearing about the nascent world of decentralized finance, more popularly referred to as DeFi. Just a melange of decentralized apps (dapps), automated protocols and novel financial tools, DeFi exists to disintermediate traditional financial systems – like insurance and trading pools – from third parties.      At the time DeFi was a billion dollars or so in crypto, a sub-economy of the larger Ethereum-verse. But it exploded into the public consciousness this year. With some $16.2 billion in total value locked (TVL – the amount of crypto pledged to various smart contracts), DeFi drove some of the biggest stories in crypto this year. There were protocols that launched and quickly became unicorns, no shortage of hacks and exploits and now even mergers, acquisitions and copycats. It was big enough for the Financial Times to write an explainer.      This year, as I again assist my indefatigable editor Ben Schiller in putting together CoinDesk’s Year in Review 2020, I’ve tuned my ear to the rumbling of what could be the next big trend in crypto. Unfortunately, it doesn’t have a sexy name like DeFi, nor is it a novel field, but non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are the crypto tools the cool kids are talking about.      NFTs are blockchain-based tokens that can represent real-world or purely digital objects. Like bitcoin, they derive their value from cryptographically ensured scarcity, meaning each token is one of a kind and cannot be copy and pasted like, say, a .jpeg. So far, NFTs have mostly been associated with a strange digital art scene, but the technology can be applied anywhere that a digital object can find value in being irreproducible, I’m told      This past year several notable artists have become interested in NFT technology. Sean Ono Lennon, John and Yoko’s son, sold an original artwork this week. House musician Guy J sold the rights to one of his songs – for 40 ETH – on the NFT platform Rocki. Meanwhile, rapper Lil Yachty has sold a digital collectible for $16,050. Renowned digital artist Beeple sold a collection of NFTs on Nifty Gateway for a whopping $3.5 million.

42421919,hikHVzJcuiWb3s4YOvN3qV,1608224405,Web 3.0 Infrastructure Blockchain 'The Graph' Now Live on Ethereum,"Analytics platform The Graph is now live on the Ethereum mainnet, according to the developer team. The project’s Thursday launch follows three years of work including a testnet and centralized mainnet.      The Graph seeks to create usable decentralized indexes and API feeds for blockchain-based projects through its own blockchain and native token GRT, project lead and co-founder Yaniv Tal said in a Zoom interview. The project is seeking to be a key infrastructural piece of Web 3.0.      Put simply, The Graph is a middle layer between decentralized applications (dapps) and various blockchains, enabling them to interact more fluidly; It’s the PB&J in between the blockchain and dapp bread.      Top decentralized finance (DeFi) projects Synthetix, Uniswap and Balancer, among others, currently operate on a hosted version of The Graph.      “The funny thing about blockchain data is that even though in theory everything is transparent and accessible, in practice it has historically been very opaque,” Uniswap founder Hayden Adams said in a statement. “The Graph has done great work so far in making smart contract data easy to monitor and use. Once we know more, we can build better.""    Big data, decentralized    While running an Ethereum node may only take up a few hundred gigabytes of data on a node, smart contracts nestled in Ethereum hold untold thousands more, necessitating aggressive API management, DeFi startup advisor Ric Burton told CoinDesk in a phone interview. (Burton holds an allocation of GRT tokens and is an adviser to the project).      Querying these smart contracts often requires proprietary software which translates to higher costs and more man hours for blockchain startups, he said. Indeed, his former startup wallet, Balance, ran into numerous issues due to reliance on an unreliable third party.      The need for such a middleware platform is to account-balance styled blockchains such as Ethereum. Burton said it can be difficult for blockchain-based applications to run cleanly because smart contracts can create arbitrary amounts of information in a variety of manners. For example, Ethereum has dozens of ERC token styles each requiring custom setups on a dapp-by-dapp basis.      The Graph’s overarching purpose is to create not only an alternative for projects, but to decentralize the API middle-layer, Tal said. The Graph proposes a tri-part solution to the centralized data conundrum: indexers who run nodes and process queries, delegators who stake GRT and secure the network and curators who appraise feeds and signal to indexers which queries to run.      Indexers, delegators and curators are incentivized to build better APIs through the network’s native token, which is paid out depending on the performance of indexes called subgraphs.      The Graph saw traction on its self-hosted version, Tal said, with some 10 billion queries last month alone, up tenfold since June.

42421913,hikHVzJcuiWb3s4YOvN3gd,1608222327,"CFTC's Latest Crypto Primer Highlights DeFi, Governance","Decentralized finance (DeFi) and crypto governance are among a growing list of topics the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is watching in the digital asset space, the CFTC said in a new primer.      The regulatory agency published the primer Thursday as part of an ongoing effort to understand and explain the crypto industry. The primer isn’t intended to create policy, but to inform or educate interested parties on digital asset derivatives and other financial technologies.      Melissa Netram, director of LabCFTC and the Commission’s Chief Innovation Officer, told CoinDesk: “Digital assets are still very complex and one of the key points to mention is that there are so many regulators here in the U.S. that [oversee] digital assets,” she said. “It’s important for regulatory coordination.”      The space is still evolving rapidly, said Brian Trackman, senior counsel at LabCFTC. The division’s task is to track that evolution and ensure other groups within the CFTC are up to speed.      The 36-page document mentions decentralized finance, governance and markets as issues that warrant further study.      “It’s not meant to be an exclusive list, [but] some of the topics we hope there will be further conversation about,” said Trackman, the primer’s chief author. “Decentralized finance applications seem to multiply exponentially, [and] there’s the issue of governance whether in terms of DeFi or just bitcoin and ether and how they’ll evolve.”      The agency’s last primer was published two years ago, and noted that smart contracts would be subject to financial laws within the U.S. The newest one is fairly broad, detailing derivatives products that fall within the agency’s purview and listing how the CFTC or other agencies can interact with the crypto industry.      LabCFTC met with industry participants ranging from “individuals with an idea to established large financial institutions” as it prepared the document, Trackman said.      “In the scheme of things it’s small, comparatively,” Netram said of the CFTC’s studies of the digital asset space.“That being said, I think what our role is, is to continue to highlight the ever-growing and ever-changing market so that we’re ahead of the curve and we’re constantly addressing new technologies and new innovations,” Netram said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | COMMODITY | MARKET | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/12/17/cftcs-latest-crypto-primer-highlights-defi-governance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/05c15f08184f9f3ce21a7240c758bcb9bce349f6-1600x881.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421917,hikHVzJcuiWb3s4YOvN3x5,1608220843,"DeFi Startup Brings Corporate Lending Terms to Miners, Traders and Market Makers","Loan terms are about to get a lot better in decentralized finance (DeFi), at least for some.      ""What we're allowing is top institutions with solid balance sheets, sound reputations and strong cash flows soon being able to access capital-efficient finance, which enables further growth and adoption of crypto globally,"" Sidney Powell, co-founder and CEO of Maple Finance, told CoinDesk in a phone call.      Maple Finance is a new firm out of Australia releasing a token-governed platform for institutional lending at extremely competitive collateralization terms and fixed rates that won't change for borrowers in good standing.      The firm has closed a $1.3 million seed round for its MPL governance token with Framework Ventures, Alameda Research, Aave founder Stani Kulechov, Synthetix founder Kain Warwick, FBG, The LAO and others.      With over $15 billion in total value locked in DeFi as of this writing, it's either time for fixed-rate, under-collateralized lending or it's overdue. Maple is targeting the companies with a track record in the space such as funds that engage in trading, market makers and crypto-mining firms looking to expand operations.      The typical loan in DeFi requires significant over-collateralization, with users needing to constantly check to make sure their collateralization is topped up as market conditions change.      On Maple, a good firm would pay one rate for the life of the loan, could collateralize with as little as 40% of the loan's value and the initial collateral deposit would not need to be revisited.      ""With ours, it's a set-it-and-forget-it solution,"" Joe Flanagan, Maple's other co-founder, said. ""As long as you remain a paying borrower and meeting your obligations there will be no further calls on your collateral.""    First pool    Maple is able to offer better terms based on the reputation of borrowers. It will make offers only to institutional customers.      That said, Flannagan noted, as this market matures and evolves, Maple would definitely be interested in serving crypto-native organizations, such as decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that don't have traditional legal structures. That ""expands the addressable market for Maple,"" he said.      Maple intends to be everywhere the industry goes. ""We're building a capital market in the crypto space,"" Powell said.      Maple will be organized by pools, with each pool managed by a ""Pool Delegate"" who will make decisions about loans in that pool. Pools will specialize in certain areas where the delegate has expertise, such as a region of the world, a category of borrower or a risk profile.      Its first pool will be small, to demonstrate the model. It will have between $10 million and $15 million in funds available for lending, with loans in the $1 million to 2 million range. Maple will initially aim for a pool with a diverse array of borrowers, but all well-established and carefully selected.      One or two pools will be co-managed by Maple Finance and its first Pool Delegate, Orthogonal Trading, a crypto firm, also out of Australia, starting in the first quarter of 2021.    Liquidity mining    Maple Finance will be a DeFi platform like others, governed by its MPL token and offering opportunities for yield from anyone on Ethereum.      While it will be more cautious than other DeFi projects about to whom it makes loans, providing liquidity to Maple will be open to anyone who wants to get in.      Once the first pool opens, it will be open to participation from across Ethereum up to the maximum amount that a pool ultimately sets. That capital will then be deployed to make the loans.      ""We assume it will be a combination of both individuals and degens and institutions and corporates,"" Flanagan said.      Additionally, those liquidity providers will earn MPL tokens under a liquidity mining scheme whose precise terms have not yet been worked out.      The total supply of MPL tokens will be fixed at 10 million, with approximately 30% going to liquidity mining.      MPL governs the network and earns a modest return from its fees. MPL holders have the opportunity to increase their returns by staking but will also bear the brunt of losses in the pool if a borrower defaults.      ""Our intent is not for the token to be considered a security,"" Powell said, noting Maple is taking advice on legal matters. There are no plans currently to shut out U.S. residents from holding the MPL token.      While Maple's offering is likely to be attractive to traders in the space, it will be particularly interesting to see if bitcoin miners take advantage of it. ""We would be interested in financing miners for their capital expenditures to expand their operations,"" Powell said.      If that happens, that will be an early example of value moving about in blockchain-verified bits that has funded the acquisition of equipment built out of atoms in the analog world, which seems like a milestone on the way to somewhere.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/12/17/defi-startup-brings-corporate-lending-terms-to-miners-traders-and-market-makers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/58f8d344c82572afcae14c94b4211d187846ac47-1935x1100.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421922,hikHVzJcuiWb3s4YOvN46x,1608215718,Bridging Cultural Gaps in 2021: Crypto in China and the US,"The information and cultural gaps between China and the U.S. are profound. I’ve been fortunate to fully appreciate this firsthand as a native Chinese citizen living in Hangzhou working at a U.S.-based investment firm.      In crypto markets, information bifurcates across the Pacific Ocean, actionable information doesn’t travel across as quickly as data packets travel over fiber. While you may be familiar with the Western channels – Telegram, Twitter, Discord, Medium – there is an entirely separate universe of crypto that exists and operates in Chinese channels – on WeChat, Weibo, Bihu and others. But that’s just the tip of the spear. The lack of overlap between these two markets is further compounded by additional cultural, timezone and language barriers.    This post is part of CoinDesk's Year in Review 2020 – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Mable Jiang is a principal at Multicoin Capital, a thesis-driven investment firm that invests in cryptocurrencies, tokens and blockchain companies. Follow her on Twitter at @mable_jiang.    How information flows, how relationships and ties between parties differ, how varying social norms create friction and differing consumer behaviors all combine to form the unique and idiosyncratic market structures for crypto in the U.S. and China.      As we look to the year ahead, the high demand of interpersonal trust, the preference of mobile user interface, the WeChat-oriented information flow and the “pragmatism” in the Chinese culture will continue to hold true. Yet, as more channels for cross-cultural communication come around, Chinese and American crypto operators should be able understand the nuances between these cultures and more effectively market their services in the other market.    Understanding trust    One of the most important differences I’ve observed between China and the U.S. is how market participants build and develop trust with each other. People in China prefer to trust someone they know or someone they can interact directly with, whereas people in the U.S. tend to trust brands.      In our investment thesis for dForce (the China-based decentralized finance super network), I argued that one of its unforkable moats was its local business ties and distribution channels. Mindao Yang, dForce’s founder, is a well-respected influencer in the local community and was able to forge strong relationships with key players in the Chinese crypto ecosystem because of his prominent position. Having personal relationships with the local community gatekeepers, crypto operators and key distribution channels in China is an unquantifiable, yet undeniable, edge.    Chinese users live by 'not your keys, not your coins' because of higher trust requirements embedded in Chinese culture.    DeFi protocols are not businesses. They are, in theory at least, permissionless, headless organizations. Despite this, Chinese users expect customer service to be available in chat rooms, from real people who can explain using real words how these protocols work. This is why we often see the senior officials from Asia-based exchanges like Binance, Huobi, and OKEx make themselves available in WeChat groups to answer customers’ questions.      These trust requirements uniquely shape how business gets done in China. For example, prime brokerage in the U.S. typically refers to three separate business lines: lending, trading and custody. Unlike in the U.S., most prime brokerage firms in China emphasize lending and asset management services.      Almost none of the major Chinese crypto prime brokers offer custody as a standalone service because they know Chinese people prefer managing their private keys as opposed to delegating (trusting) it to someone else. This is a function of healthy, ever-present suspicion in Chinese culture. Chinese ""whales"" [those with large positions] guard all of their holdings closely, sometimes exclusively on their phone.      In the U.S. on the other hand, many crypto institutions not only entrust their capital with Securities and Exchange Commission-regulated custodians, they actually require it. They don’t want to take on the custody risk themselves because, in their minds, the “system” is more trustworthy. In the event a Chinese whale delegates his or her capital to a quantitative trading firm, they usually only authorize an exchange API to the trading team instead of allowing them to take direct custody.      Again, Chinese users live by “not your keys, not your coins” because of higher trust requirements embedded in Chinese culture. Entrepreneurs need to understand these subtleties to most effectively compete on a global basis.      For these reasons (and many others), I typically try to help our non-Chinese portfolio companies hire someone on the ground who speaks the local language so that person can engage users and potential business partners on an interpersonal level.    Understanding user preference    User behaviors and preferences across markets differ widely, and those preferences have resulted in localized product strategies for the dominant players in each region.      In China, smartphones dominate internet usage. Even some of the most sophisticated derivatives trades are executed on smartphones. This stands in stark contrast to the U.S. and other Western countries where traders would much prefer to log into a website on their desktop.      For a significant number of Chinese, their phone was their first and still only computer. Because users’ prefer (and rely on) mobile interfaces, these mobile applications naturally compete with each other on user retention. Under such pressure, the most successful ones have grown into the superapps, like WeChat and Alipay, which allow customers to solve all their problems in one place without going anywhere else.      Despite the fact that crypto is a borderless phenomena, user behaviors are still largely shaped by the ingrained user behaviors from the Web 2.0 era. For example, Asian exchanges are more likely to become superapps that offer cross-product services. Binance is a great example of this; over the last two years it has aggressively ""blitzscaled"" by continuously expanding its business from basic spot and futures trading to the more sophisticated options trading, to new staking services, mining pools and fiat over-the-counter applications. Binance is attempting to offer every crypto financial service imaginable – all within a single app.      Coinbase, for example, reflects Western business strategy, with separate business lines and products for Custody, Prime, Pro and Retail.      Understanding user preferences and locationization is still a strong differentiator. That won’t change in 2021. Entrepreneurs need localized strategies in China and the U.S.    Understanding information flow    Platforms like Twitter, Discord, Telegram and Medium in the U.S. welcome permissionless, pseudonymous online participation and the (relatively) free flow of information across platforms. It’s no secret that the primary venue for crypto information exchange in the U.S. is Twitter: users openly comment and freely follow whomever they like.      China couldn’t be more different. The primary venue is not Weibo (China’s version of Twitter), nor is it Bihu (a crypto-native discussion forum like Medium). Rather, it’s WeChat.      WeChat is a superapp and its information flows are close-ended. This makes WeChat a microcosm of information that originates exclusively from within. Everything starts and finishes in WeChat groups, WeChat embedded hyperlinks and WeChat Moments.      As a result, the hurdle to build a community is higher in China because everyone has to use WeChat and it’s not easy to form a large WeChat group. For example:    Groups are capped at 500 people  QR codes have an expiration date  When the group is larger than 200, people cannot join via the QR code and the group manager needs to manually pull people in    On Twitter anyone can easily unfollow someone else. In a WeChat group, especially in the ones that have fewer than 100 people, members face social pressure for “quitting” the group. Some influencers in China go so far as to monetize their “private domain traffic” by charging fees for entry to their groups, which gives its members a special sense of community (and creates a perceived cost for leaving).      Yet, the closer binding relationship on WeChat creates a more level playing field among whales, institutions and retail participants. A “thought leader” in the U.S. with a few hundred thousand followers on Twitter does not necessarily follow back all his followers, and as a result he or she cannot see all of the feedback. This one-way relationship effectively draws a line between crypto influencers and professional institutions and retail players.      On WeChat, however, representatives of institutions and retail players commonly end up in the same group. This “flatter” setting essentially enables bi-directional communication between the professionals and retail investors.      Projects trying to market in China or the U.S. have to understand these information flow differences. In China, media is controlled and influenced by contractual relationships. In the U.S., media is “earned.” As crypto grows in relevance, more communication channels will emerge and the structure of information flow will continue to fragment.    Understanding pragmatism vs. idealism    BitMEX's Arthur Hayes once joked about how good marketing to a Chinese audience could make any token look promising. His joke was not all in jest; it reflects a deeper reality of crypto capital markets.      Despite the fact Vitalik received tremendous support in China during the early days of Ethereum, today ETH maximalism is on the decline in China relative to the U.S. This stands in contrast to Crypto Twitter, where ETH maximalists passionately promote Ethereum.    The products and protocols they are building are becoming increasingly more local and more global simultaneously.    Participants in China tend to be less evangelical than the participants in the West. While there are many factors, one of the more salient is that Asian culture has stronger roots in trading. As traders, it is rational for them to look at all the potential coins and choose the ones they believe have the best risk/reward profile.      Traders by definition are not ideological, and so they tend to be more open-minded to ideas that challenge their existing beliefs. Meanwhile, the choices of local developers are also partially impacted by the optics of the market. Developers value the ecosystem having enough public attention and offering marketing and PR support when they consider which ecosystem in which to build.      In China, established blockchains like Ethereum no longer serve the role in their portfolio they once did – being long ETH is just another way to get beta exposure; opportunities for alpha are further down the market cap list. On the other hand, a newly emerged layer 1 can be far more attractive because of its potential upside, especially if traders believe they have knowledge or information that the market does not.      Thanks to initiatives like the “Open the Door Policy"" initiated by Deng Xiaoping, China's former leader, Chinese people are more inclined to accept new ideas and value practical problem solving. This extends to the Chinese crypto community, which is known to favor blockchain performance over embedded ideology.      We’ve seen this time and time again, first with Ethereum after Bitcoin, then with EOS after Ethereum and most recently with Polkadot, Cosmos, Solana, Avalanche and Near, not to mention all of the Chinese cousins of Western DeFi projects. (Disclosure: Multicoin Capital is long SOL and NEAR.)    The year ahead    Going into 2021, crypto entrepreneurs must realize the products and protocols they are building are becoming increasingly more local and more global simultaneously. The U.S. and China are clearly the two most pivotal markets, and winning both would mean unprecedented success.      Two years ago, the idea of going to market in America and China was unthinkable. Today, entrepreneurs absolutely must plan and execute unique strategies for both the U.S. and China or risk being left behind.      While the number of channels between the U.S. and China grows, the cultural moats and user behaviors I described above show no sign of materially evolving anytime soon. As firms look to deploy capital next year, they are looking for teams who understand and appreciate the opportunities that cultural differences unlock and those who see the distance between our two countries as an unique advantage to exploit rather than a hindrance on global expansion.      Such cultural bridges are more easily described than built. The winning strategy is going to be idiosyncratic: There is no single template that will guarantee market share.",NEUTRAL,ETH,ASIA | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Mable Jiang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/17/bridging-cultural-gaps-in-2021-crypto-in-china-and-the-us,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c2217657e3dd415cd5f8b7e26d9ef6b03bd5015f-1420x916.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The recent surge in bitcoin-related Twitter content comes as the leading cryptocurrency surged past $23,000 yesterday, reaching an intra-day high just below the $24,000 mark.      Jan. 17, 2018, was the last time this many bitcoin tweets were sent in a single day, after bitcoin's price started crashing from its then-all-time high just below $20,000.      Throughout much of 2020, the bitcoin rally has been dominated by a narrative focused on institutional investors allocating large amounts of capital to the cryptocurrency, including Stanley Druckenmiller and Guggenheim's Scott Minerd.      But near-record levels of Twitter activity is one signal that retail bitcoin investors are not being left behind.      “There has been a lot of talk that bitcoin’s latest bull run is fueled by Wall Street jumping on board, but if yesterday is any indication it’s the everyman who is fueling the conversation, specifically on Twitter,"" according to Aubrey Strobel, communications director for bitcoin rewards startup Lolli.    Tweetstorm    According to data from The TIE, it wasn't just high-volume tweeters driving the uptick. The number of unique Twitter accounts tweeting about bitcoin also surged, with roughly 50,000 users engaging in the bitcoin conversation Wednesday, the most since before Christmas 2017.      Strobel's company runs one of the most popular corporate bitcoin Twitter accounts, and she told CoinDesk Lolli is seeing a surge in interaction with its content as ""retail investors are finding every opportunity to own bitcoin.""      Other indications of strong retail participation come from the use of consumer-focused bitcoin products, like record buying volume on Square's (SQ) Cash App along with strong demand for new services like PayPal’s (PYPL) cryptocurrency features.      Commenting on the surge in social media activity, Messari bitcoin analyst Ryan Watkins told CoinDesk, ""Institutions may be leading the charge this time around, but retail is definitely not sitting on the sidelines.""",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | TRADING,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/17/bitcoin-chatter-on-twitter-nears-highest-level-in-3-years-amid-price-surge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5c2634234167b7b6a18e92da99047f007f9f05ce-1020x685.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421923,hikHVzJcuiWb3s4YOvN4AF,1608215015,The Year We Learned the Rewards and Risks of Smart Devices,"Privacy has been a growing topic of debate over the past year. Already a cause of concern due to years of worsening data breaches as well as corporate and government surveillance, the subject has taken on even greater urgency in 2020. With the global COVID-19 pandemic forcing a massive shift to remote work and schooling around the world, digital privacy is more important than ever.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Raullen Chai is the co-founder of IoTeX, a Silicon Valley company building the Internet of Trusted Things with blockchain-powered smart devices that protect privacy.    But what many of the current conversations around privacy miss is a major evolution of the nature of data itself. While most of us think of data as being generated online – for instance, our social media activity or web-browsing history – the pandemic has accelerated the use of data from physical smart devices. This includes computers and phones, but a growing number of tools made necessary by the pandemic, like digital assistants, webcams, smart TVs, even VR headsets. The huge amounts of data these devices generate is expected to reach 80 zettabytes by 2025, meaning privacy is no longer a simple story of internet searches and online purchases.      It now touches many of the key, everyday processes we use to navigate through this new reality.      Traditionally, corporations – not consumers – have owned and custodied information, which is stored in centralized servers and shared with numerous third parties. If we maintain these older models of data management, the risk of hacks and security breaches will only become more severe. This year saw an increase in high-profile hacks of devices such as Ring home doorbell cameras. Such breaches demonstrate the ways in which smart devices can put people’s privacy and safety in danger like never before.      See also: Third-Party Trackers Are Pulling Your Data Off Ring’s Android App      The world is ready for another option: self-sovereign identity and self-ownership of data. Regulation, culture and technical innovation are all converging around a bottoms-up concept of verifiable, user-generated and user-owned information. The idea of “your keys, your funds” is expanding beyond cryptocurrency to the smart devices that are increasingly central to our lives: “your keys, your data.”      People have been talking about this concept, invoking ideas such as decentralized identity, for years with little material result. Now it’s different. In 2020 we saw continued momentum for privacy-protecting regulations like GDPR and CCP, including the passage in November of California’s Proposition 24. These are beginning to turn the traditional model of data ownership on its head.      The past year also saw, for the first time, the emergence of “privacy-by-design” smart devices that give everyday people exclusive ownership of their data. Where data has historically been viewed as a corporate asset, the emergence of self-sovereign products and stringent data privacy regulations is now turning data ownership for corporations into a liability.      The implications of this are enormous. With data ownership in the hands of people, not corporations, much of what is broken about the way digital information is handled can begin to be fixed.    Control and freedom will finally be back in the hands of the people    When law and code are premised on the notion that the trails of data we create belong to us in the same way a written letter or physical receipt do, business models based on data mining can be right-sized. More importantly, individuals will finally have real control over who has access to their data, when, why and for how long. Smart, self-sovereign devices like Ucam are already demonstrating how user-owned data can protect privacy in a world of connected devices.      None of this is to say that every problem related to information security will be solved when data is self-sovereign. Just as it’s possible to lose a receipt, or unwisely give your phone number to a stranger, there will still be risks and pitfalls. But the power, and the choice, will be in the hands of the individual. Corporations will not have carte blanche to collect, analyze and sell reams of data on their users’ activities without their permission. This won’t be because of any change of heart, but because the data won’t be theirs in the first place. Ownership of data will finally be where it belongs: in the hands of those who create it.      See also: Raullen Chai – Look to Design, Not Laws, to Protect Privacy in the Surveillance Age      The world in 2020 finally reached an inflection point around data privacy – and the path forward will be one of self sovereignty. As smart devices become increasingly embedded in the way we live, work and learn, this model will ensure our devices, the information they capture, and the value they generate will belong to us and us alone.      Control and freedom will finally be back in the hands of the people, enabling previously unimaginable business models that empower everyday people, not “too big to fail” institutions.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,Raullen Chai,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/12/17/the-year-we-learned-the-rewards-and-risks-of-smart-devices,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f00eae57f5fbb5e4b137c676b2040c2147642566-1420x916.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Gold is up 24%.    Market moves    (Editor's note: This is the fourth installment of First Mover's recap of how the bitcoin market evolved over the course of 2020 and what it means for the future. Today we cover the month of May, when the Bitcoin blockchain underwent its once-every-four-years ""halving."" Outlandishly high price predictions for the cryptocurrency failed to materialize, but the network's programmed reduction in the pace of new bitcoin issuance set up a stark contrast with Federal Reserve money printing, measured in the trillions of dollars.)      In early 2020, before the devastating economic toll of the coronavirus became clear to investors, the main narrative in the bitcoin market was the upcoming ""halving"" – an arcane, once-every-four years occurrence that takes place on the underlying blockchain network.      Since the Bitcoin blockchain was invented only 11 years ago, it would just be the third halving in history. It was very technical, but the whole process was hard-coded into the network's underlying programming, and the basics went something like this: At a certain point in May, the pace of new issuance of bitcoin by the blockchain would get cut in half, to about 6.25 bitcoins every 10 minutes or so from the 12.5-bitcoin average clip that had prevailed over the recent four-year period.      Generally speaking, few surprises were expected, with all the details stipulated in advance. But that was sort of the point: Under the cryptocurrency's design, things were supposed to run like clockwork, giving humans little leeway to intervene based on subjectivity or politics.      These were no ordinary times. In the prior months, the deep economic toll of the coronavirus had sent global markets reeling, dragging down bitcoin prices from a high of about $10,500 in February to as low as $3,850 by mid-March. Then, as the Federal Reserve and other global authorities started pumping trillions of dollars into the financial system, asset prices shot back up, and by April bitcoin traded as high as $9,485.      Cryptocurrency market analysts talked up the halving as a potential catalyst for a price rally; one German bank went so far as to predict that bitcoin could shoot to $90,000 or higher.      “Look for prices to attempt the $10,000 level on speculative buzz leading into the halving,” Jehan Chu, co-founder and managing partner at Hong Kong-based blockchain investment and trading firm Kenetic Capital, told CoinDesk in late April.      CoinDesk even built its own ""Bitcoin Block Reward Halving Countdown"" to mark the estimated time and date of the big event. With everything going on in the world, the halving took on the feel of a geek-fest for crypto insiders. The suspense came mainly from watching the price charts: Would the halving drive bitcoin prices to the moon?      As it turned out, the halving came on May 11 and proved anticlimactic by pretty much all accounts. Industry executives on a CoinDesk halving-countdown talk show, held via Zoom, had to pass the time with technical discussions of the future potential of bitcoin mining computers and how much the network’s speed might accelerate over the next four years.      When the blockchain network finally reached block number 630,000, the moment everyone was waiting for, someone posted a snippet of code on Twitter showing the halving had indeed happened. There were some huzzahs all around, and everyone dropped out of the Zoom room.      “This is more of a holiday for the crypto community than anything else,” Mati Greenspan, of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency research firm Quantum Economics, wrote in a note to clients.      Over the course of the month, prices never climbed much above $9,000.      “We are seeing buy-the-rumor, sell-the-fact at work,” Russell Shor, a senior market specialist at the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency-trading firm FXCM, said in emailed comments.      Underneath the deflating buzz, though, was an epiphany: The blockchain network was working exactly as designed, and not even the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression had thrown it off course.      What's more, the reduction in the pace of bitcoin issuance provided a sharp contrast with the monetary policies pursued by the Federal Reserve and other major central banks.      The human central bankers, to their credit, were doing all they could to keep the world's financial system from collapsing. But the dynamic meant that bitcoin, with its hard-coded and ever-diminishing supply curve, might serve investors as a bulwark against debasement of the U.S. dollar and other currencies.      To underscore the point, the Chinese bitcoin-mining pool f2pool embedded a message into the blockchain record for data block No. 629,999: “NYTimes 09/Apr/2020 With $2.3T Injection, Fed’s Plan Far Exceeds 2008 Rescue.” It was a headline for a news article from the prior month, detailing a massive money-printing episode by the U.S. central bank.      Coin Metrics, a cryptocurrency analysis firm, revisited the theme in a report earlier this week, illustrating how the blockchain's quadrennial halvings might provide confidence to investors looking for an asset that isn't subject to human discretion and qualitative judgments.      ""Halvings will keep occurring every four years until the supply cap of 21 million bitcoin has been reached,"" the analysts wrote. ""This means we can project well into the future, and have clarity about what Bitcoin’s inflation rate will look like one, five or 10 years from now.""      That might be easier, even, than trying to predict what Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues might do at their next meeting in January.      - Bradley Keoun    Bitcoin Watch    Bitcoin surged to new record highs above $23,000 earlier on Thursday, before quickly falling back by over $1,500.      The cryptocurrency dropped from the all-time high of $23,770 to $22,185 in the roughly 30 minutes to 09:45 coordinated universal time (UTC), representing a 6.7% drop, according to the CoinDesk 20.      The sudden pullback was backed by the highest hourly sell volume since Nov. 26 and suggests uptrend fatigue. The cryptocurrency could consolidate in the broad range of $20,000 to $24,000 in the short term. The derivatives market and on-chain activity suggest scope for a continuation of the rally.      While the average level of funding rate on bitcoin perpetual futures across major exchanges has risen from 0.005% to 0.036%, it remains well below the high of 0.093% seen before the Nov. 24 price drop. Calculated every eight hours, the funding rate reflects the cost of holding long positions. It is positive (or longs pay shorts) when perpetuals trade at a premium to the spot price. As such, a very high funding rate is widely considered a sign of leverage being excessively skewed to the bullish side, or overbought conditions.      In other words, leverage isn’t skewed too bullish, which could mean the cryptocurrency has scope to rally further.

42421912,hikHVzJcuiWb3s4YOvN3a3,1608214187,Global Stablecoins Could Eventually Become Reserve Currencies: IMF Paper,"Private stablecoins such as libra (now rebranded as diem) could emerge as international reserve currencies, according to an International Monetary Fund (IMF) report.    Titled “Reserve Currencies in an Evolving International Monetary System,” the departmental paper looks at shifts in the global monetary system and factors that might influence the U.S. dollar's role as the dominant reserve currency, including new payments systems and digital currency.  While their study concluded overall that the dollar is safe for now, the authors said the reserve currency landscape would likely shift.  They posited that private digital currencies could ""emerge as important international currencies,"" with libra/diem possibly becoming the first example of a global stablecoin.  Global stablecoins (or GSCs) could also increase the demand for reserve fiat currencies they're backed by, according to the paper.  ""But GSCs do not need to be backed by existing fiat reserve currencies and could themselves attain reserve currency status,"" the authors write. ""It is also conceivable that more than one global stablecoin could become a reserve asset.""  The paper theorizes that rather than be differentiated by macroeconomic factors, digital currency competition would differentiate along network lines and by users.  And while digital currency ""may cut across borders in ways that existing currencies do not,"" different regulatory frameworks might lead to increased fragmentation, said the IMF.

42421924,hikHVzJcuiWb3s4YOvN4DX,1608214140,Digital Assets Find Their Footing in Unstable Times,"The British poet Alfred Tennyson once wrote: “Hope smiles from the threshold of the year to come, whispering ‘it will be happier’…”      The majority of those reading that line hope it applies to 2021 because this past year has been one of the more difficult in modern times. A global pandemic that began in December 2019 has now affected 65 million people around the world, killing 1.5 million. It has made us change the way we live our lives, from where and how we work, our children’s schooling, sheltering in home, how we interact in our local economies and so much more.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. David Nage is principal at Arca Funds, which applies institutional-grade asset management processes to crypto.    With all the pain and heartache something happened along the way: eyes were opened, or, as some people call it, we got to see how the “sausage is made.” The response society witnessed from policy makers and central bankers this year has created one of the most significant catalysts of interest for digital assets.      As Brent Schrotenboer writes and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell confirmed on “60 Minutes” this year: “With a few strokes on a computer, the Federal Reserve can create dollars out of nothing, virtually ‘printing’ money and injecting it into the commercial banking system, much like an electronic deposit. By the end of 2020, the Fed is projected to have purchased $3.5 trillion in government securities with these newly created dollars, according to Oxford Economics.”      Morgan Stanley chief U.S. equity strategist Mike Wilson wrote recently: “It’s fair to say we have never observed money supply growth as high as it is today. The year-over-year [percentage] change in the M2 supply is now north of 23%. To put that in perspective, year-over-year growth in the M2 money supply had never exceeded 15% until 2020, according to Fed records dating back to 1981.      “Just since February, a global total of $3.9 trillion (6.6% of global GDP) has been magically created through quantitative easing.”    Three letters: P-T-J    In March, the world was presented with one of the most important investment thought pieces penned about bitcoin. Many of us focused on the legendary Paul Tudor Jones, known and regarded as one of the most exceptional global macro investors of our time. However, upon deeper inspection, we noticed there was a co-author: Lorenzo Giorgianni. Why was this important?      Prior to joining Tudor, Lorenzo held several senior positions at the International Monetary Fund in Washington for 17 years, where he took a leadership role in the IMF’s efforts to revamp the international financial architecture and resolve financial crises.      See also: Byrne Hobart – PTJ on BTC: Bitcoin Is Now the Macro Big Bet      Not a known ardent bitcoin supporter but rather a 17-year career professional from the IMF helped PTJ analyze and structure how bitcoin could play a role in an investor’s portfolio; revolutionary.      And this was just the start.    Corporations at the gate    PTJ’s letter created the single largest catalyst of interest in digital assets among the family office and institutional investor ecosystem. Up until that point institutional CIOs were making small personal investments in bitcoin and digital assets, not multi-million dollar investments. They were plagued with one thing: career risk.      With Paul Tudor Jones on the “cap table,” they took the time to learn he had company with the likes of Abigail Johnson, Cathie Wood, Bill Miller and others. They were provided with some level of “cover.”      Shortly after “the letter,” the digital asset ecosystem got more good news, this time from corporations.      MicroStrategy (MSTR; market cap $3B), over a period of two months from August to September, acquired $425 million worth of bitcoin for its treasury.      MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor said the Federal Reserve’s recent relaxation of its inflation policy helped convince him to put the remainder of the enterprise-software maker’s cash into bitcoin. Saylor went on to say he feels “pretty confident that bitcoin is less risky than holding cash, less risky than holding gold.”    We believe that bitcoin has the potential to be a more ubiquitous currency in the future.    Soon after, PayPal (PYPL; market cap of $250B), founded in 1998 by Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and other Silicon Valley legends, known as an online payments behemoth, announced plans to enable the buying, selling and use of digital assets with its over 300 million users and 25 million vendors. In just the first few weeks of enabling this service, Mizuho Securities has observed 20% of PayPal’s users have already used it to engage with bitcoin and digital assets.      Square (SQ; market cap $90B), known as an early advocate of bitcoin, acquired $50 million of bitcoin in a similar manner to MicroStrategy. Square CFO Amrita Ahuja was on record as saying, “We believe that bitcoin has the potential to be a more ubiquitous currency in the future.”      The most recent news came from Visa (V; market cap of $450B) announced it is connecting its global payments network of 60 million merchants to USDC, run by the Centre Consortium.      All of this is in addition to news this year that banks such as JPMorgan are now providing banking services to Coinbase and Gemini makes it clear that multinational, billion-dollar, publicly traded corporations are accelerating their exposure to digital assets and businesses that are servicing this asset class.    Beyond bitcoin    While bitcoin had one of the most significant years in adoption, another narrative began to solidify: the reimagining of traditional financial operations such as lending, borrowing and collateralization done via decentralized protocols.      Decentralized finance, or DeFi, one of the most exciting experiments with goals of making unproductive assets productive, exploded in 2020. With the Total Value Locked (TVL) of roughly $830 million by the end of April, it emerged as an important sector in digital assets. What we saw during the next six months was significant; TVL grew month over month to reach over $14 billion as of this writing.      See also: With COMP Below $100, a Look Back at the ‘DeFi Summer’ It Sparked      While many believe bitcoin has the potential to displace gold with its $9 trillion market cap, those observing the function, tooling and growth in DeFi see it potentially displacing the world bond market totaling roughly $100 trillion.      Additionally, 2020 also saw an emergence of a few themes that have been maturing over the past two years: Web 3.0 and gaming. With approximately 4.6 billion around the world using functions on the internet and 3 billion people around the world who play games, blockchain platforms addressing these markets have a lot of space to grow into.      Gaming has seen rapid improvement in functionality and user experience in the last year. Barriers to entry such as installation of wallets and usage of digital assets have been lowered, making many new games easier to use while allowing players to potentially earn native digital assets.      Web 3.0, the promise of an internet void of centralized power authorities, saw infrastructure and functionality improve significantly in 2020 as well. With decentralized storage and indexing of data taking form, with interoperability platforms that pull from various decentralized protocols, enabling the build of more robust user applications, this space is moving from purely conceptual to reality exponentially.    Final thoughts    While this has been an incredibly difficult year for all of us personally and professionally we have witnessed an explosion of interest and adoption of digital assets which many thought would take several more years to come to fruition. From legendary investors to multinational, publicly traded companies, forces that have altered the arc of socioeconomic paradigms created a need to reallocate bandwidth and focus on what has been built in this new, emerging, highly dynamic asset class.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,David Nage,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/17/digital-assets-find-their-footing-in-unstable-times,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ba2920d4a2f0c6e74f729c6a47ac281ef88eb315-1420x916.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421920,hikHVzJcuiWb3s4YOvN43f,1608213610,"US Bitcoin Mining Firm Core Scientific to Triple Capacity With Massive 59,000-Machine Order","U.S. blockchain and AI infrastructure provider Core Scientific has expanded its fleet of state-of-the-art crypto miners to over 77,000, comprising the largest-ever grouping of Bitmain Antminer S19 rigs outside of China.      Core Scientific, which offers a mix of hosted crypto-mining and data-science computation, ordered the miners earlier this year. The company announced Thursday it has now procured an additional 59,000 S19 and S19 Pro Antminers.      The new order will bring the total computational power hosted with Core Scientific to 7.26 exahash per second (EH/s) while using approximately 250MW of electricity, said Taras Kulyk, the firm’s senior VP of blockchain development.      “We are truly a global player with this order, which is a magnitude of scale larger than anything that’s been done in North America today” said Kulyk.      One of Core Scientific’s closest U.S. rivals, Nasdaq-listed Marathon Patent Group (MARA), recently announced it was buying some 10,000 Antminers, which will bring the firm’s total hashrate to 2.56 EH/s.      The new units will be spread across Core Scientific’s existing facilities in North Carolina, Georgia and Kentucky, Kulyk said. A large chunk of the energy consumed by the miners will be renewable power. Core Scientific’s facilities cover over 100 acres and the firm is now looking for more space to house the new rigs.      Core Scientific’s bullish news comes as the price of bitcoin hits all-time highs and the stocks of listed crypto mining companies surge upward. (Core Scientific remains privately held.)    See also: Bitcoin Mining Stocks Soar as BTC Blows Past $20K    While the U.S. hashrate is certainly on the increase, China far and away dominates crypto mining with around 65% of global hashpower. According to Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, U.S. and Canada combined account for just 8.5% of the pie. But North America has more publicly traded mining companies than anywhere else and a muscular reach towards institutional investors.      Recently, Core Scientific announced a deal with Digital Currency Group mining subsidiary Foundry to receive some $23 million in financing to build out mining equipment for Core and its clients. (Digital Currency Group is also the owner of CoinDesk.)      A further coup for Core Scientific happened back in September when it became Bitmain’s “cooperative repair center” for mining equipment in North America. That’s a big deal because it saves having to box up tons of computers and ship them to China.      “When you have 77,000 units, to have to unpack and ship them somewhere else for repair is a direct impact to your bottom line,” said Kulyk.      Bitmain is experiencing a spike in demand for the latest Antminers, which are sold out until July 2021.      “There’s absolutely a massive supply crunch right now,“ Kulyk said. “We are oversubscribed, even with this order.”",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/12/17/us-bitcoin-mining-firm-core-scientific-to-triple-capacity-with-massive-59000-machine-order,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b8b562c87e3d7ab4818e76a4299350365d8bd31c-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The criminals who executed the breach are still unknown, Skorjanc said, calling the incident ""the largest theft in Slovenian history.""  The bitcoin are worth $104,629,328 at press time, according to CoinDesk 20 data. At the time of the breach, they would have had a value of around $55 million.

The token was auctioned using decentralized auction protocol Bounce.finance and sold for 40 ether.

Another token Rocki will issue – an ERC-1155 standard NFT – will bring purchasers “exclusive listening privileges.”  Rocki CEO and co-founder Bjorn Niclas said there have been more than 30,000 tracks uploaded by thousands of independent artists as the platform prepares to launch in beta.  The company further said streaming platforms like Spotify typically give independent artists “only pocket change for their work.”  As such, Rocki is well-positioned to become “the preferred streaming service for all genres of independent artists,” according to the announcement.

Also joining the round were Peter Thiel’s Mithril Capital, newly formed Alua Capital and PayPal Ventures.

Cascarilla did not disclose the company’s current valuation.      “We are not a unicorn, that’s what I will say,” he said.      The Series C will accelerate the firm’s efforts to provide blockchain and cryptocurrency infrastructure solutions to a wide range of financial institutions, Cascarilla wrote in a draft blog post shared with CoinDesk. In addition to PayPal, Paxos’ big-name clients include Credit Suisse, Societe Generale and Revolut.      The raise will also fund a significant hiring push for the 130-person company.      “We want to double the size of our team, expand our current product solutions and build new products that enterprises need,” Cascarilla wrote.

The seventh-largest cryptocurrency by market value soared to $103.19, its highest since Aug. 5, 2019, according to CoinDesk 20 data.  Back then, litecoin had undergone its second mining reward halving, a programmed in supply cut repeated every four years to keep inflation under control.

While the average level of the bitcoin perpetual futures' “funding rate” across major exchanges has risen from 0.005% to 0.036%, it remains well below the high of 0.093% seen before the Nov. 24 price drop. In other words, leverage isn't skewed too bullish and the cryptocurrency has scope to rally further.      Calculated every eight hours, the funding rate reflects the cost of holding long positions. It is positive (or longs pay shorts) when perpetuals trade at a premium to the spot price. As such, a very high funding rate is widely considered a sign of leverage being excessively skewed to the bullish side, or overbought conditions.      Further, there are no signs of large investors looking to book profits, with prices easily rallying to record highs above $23,000. At press time, there are roughly 2,400,000 coins held on exchanges. That's the lowest since August 2018, according to data source Glassnode, and suggests investors aren't preparing for a sell-off.      Investors generally move coins from their wallets to exchanges when they plan to liquidate their holdings and take profit.      In a sign of strong holding sentiment, exchange balances have declined by over 15% this year, taking the sell-side liquidity off the market.      Traders, however, should keep an eye on spot market volumes, as liquidity may dry over the Christmas holidays. That could produce wild swings on either side.      Patrick Heusser, head of trading at Zurich-based crypto Broker AG, told CoinDesk that the move above $20,000 needs to be backed by continued growth in trading volumes.      Also read: New to Bitcoin? Stay Safe and Avoid These Common Scams      ""In terms of spot volume, we have not yet hit the amount we saw in November (but, we do have another 13 days to go).
