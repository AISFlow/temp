42397987,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbF8T1,1413848334,Bitcoin Foundation Plans New Nomination Process Before Elections,"The Bitcoin Foundation has announced updates to its corporate governance structure, including stricter rules concerning terms for board members and suggestions for a new nomination process for elections.  According to a blog posthttps://bitcoinfoundation.org/blog/, the new elections are part of the Foundation's efforts to ""instate a corporate governance structure that ensures consistency, stability and accurate representation of our membership for years to come"".  Two of the Foundation's most prominent personalities will face re-election by members to their board positions in December – chairman Peter Vessenes for his founding seat and Gavin Andresen for his individual seat.  Andresen's position as chief scientist is separate and unaffected by the elections, meaning he would retain the position even if he chooses not to stand for re-election.  Changes to board rules  Post-December, the Bitcoin Foundation's board will be almost fully elected. When the organization began, there were no members to vote and so its founding board seats were occupied by unelected volunteers.  Since then there have been efforts to improve governance by having members elect board members. The Foundation also voted in March to limit board members' terms from three to two years and to stagger the terms, easing transitions and providing ""continuity of institutional knowledge from one board member to the next"".  The election will employ secret ballots using cryptographic voting systems.  Nominating committee  The Foundation is encouraging ""healthy, dynamic, lively"" member discussion of potential board candidates. To this end, it is also considering forming a member-led nominating committee independent of the election committee.  This would enable individual members to raise their voices on what ideal candidate characteristics would be for the open individual seat, and suggest candidates to nominate.  The blog post stressed that all committees and working groups are voluntary and member-led, saying:  ""We need dedicated, experienced, and involved individuals with experience in corporate governance, finance, money services, compliance, cryptography and government affairs who are willing to put in the time and effort needed to effectively serve.""  Board rules  Under the Bitcoin Foundation's bylawshttps://bitcoinfoundation.org/about/governance-election/, members of all classes are eligible to vote for board members. The board itself has seven seats, three of which are elected by corporate members and three by individual members. One seat, formerly reserved for founding members and elected by others, was reclassified two weeks agohttps://bitcoinfoundation.org/2014/10/welcome-international-chapters/ to a 'chapter affiliate seat' to represent international chapters' interests.  The board also sets standards for its own members, and insists that board members be ""in good standing"". They must pass a background check for any felony conviction and conduct their business openly and under their real identity. The board has always had the power to remove its own members and the general Foundation membership may request an individual's removal.  The largest and most prominent organization representing bitcoin internationally, the Bitcoin Foundation engages in activities concerning standardization and protection of the technology, as well as outreach in the form of education and lobbying government and other regulatory bodies.

42398001,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbF8ep,1413832847,Coinprism Releases Colored Coins Android App for Mobile Asset Transfer,"Coinprism is brining colored coins to Android users via a new mobile wallet it describes as the first crypto 2.0 standalone wallet.  The Coinprism platform allows individual users and companies to create and issue colored coins, which can then be used as loyalty points or tokens to denote a range of physical and digital goods and services. Colored coins are bitcoins marked with certain properties to reflect digital or physical assets, and can also be used at various events for voting, tipping and more.  Flavien Charlon, founder of Coinprism, explained the potential applications of the wallet, saying:  ""We have already seen a lot of creative uses for bitcoin 2.0 platforms through user-issued assets, but I believe mobile will enable the next tier of applications. In particular there are some very interesting ways for merchants to leverage colored coins – they could reward customers paying in bitcoin by giving them back loyalty points or cashback points represented by colored coins.""  Charlon argued this approach is better for the merchant than offering a discount, as it would help ensure the customer returns to spend those points.  Colored coins go mobile  The Coinprism mobile wallet will first launch for Android. As there are no immediate plans for an iOS version, Apple users will have to use web access via HTML5.  Prior to the launch of a standalone mobile wallet, Android users have also had to rely on the HTML5 version of Coinprism.com. Coinprism said the app will be open-sourced shortly after the launch.  Coinprism provided CoinDesk with early access to the app and some sample coins. The app installed and ran smoothly on two Android 4.4.x devices. It is available for free on the Google Play store and compatible with all Android 4.x devices.  The Android app features a hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet compliant with BIP32 and BIP39 standards. Since the wallet is a standalone application, it does not require any signup or account creation. The key is automatically generated by the phone and the app can be used upon download.  Notably, the app cannot be used to issue colored coins. Coinprism said, however, that the process of issuing colored coins via its service should take no more than 10 minutes.  Colored coins vs crytpo 2.0  Coinprism maintains colored coins are the most suitable crypto 2.0 platforms for mobile payments because of how they handle transactions.  Unlike Counterparty and Mastercoin, colored coin transactions do not require an interaction with another protocol. This, he argues, makes colored coins more practical for physical transactions than other asset transfer platforms. Counterparty and Mastercoin, for example, are built on top of the bitcoin protocol but use alternate protocols and tokens, not actual bitcoins, to represent assets.  Still, Charlon said many end users often don’t realize the benefits of colored coins compared to their alternatives.  “They will become more obvious as features such as frictionless mobile payments, micropayment channels and anonymous coin mixing get released,” Charlon asserted.

42397990,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbF8Vy,1413821501,DigitalBTC Downplays Negative Cashflow in Q3 Report,"The low price of bitcoin is starting to knock a dent in digitalBTC's finances, according to the company's latest regulatory filing.  The Australia-based firm reported US$4.36m cash reserves in its Q3 report, along with approximately 8,800 BTC awaiting liquidation, which is currently valued at almost $3.37m.  However, because of investments in mining equipment and the fact that the firm is holding a significant portion of its mined bitcoin, the company posted an operating loss of $261,000.  Despite the figures, the company is downplaying the effect of short-term price fluctuations on its business and still maintains its performance is ""robust"".  Unlike most bitcoin companies, Digital CC Limited is a public company, trading on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) as 'digitalBTC'. This makes it is the only major mining operation with an obligation to provide such information, giving outsiders a rare glimpse into the inner working of a bitcoin mining company.  In addition to its mining operations, digitalBTC is in the process of expanding into the consumer space with new products under its digitalX brand.  DigitalBTC downplays short-term fluctuations  DigitalBTC executive chairman Zhenya Tsvetnenko was upbeat about the company's performance, saying:  ""Whilst the company notes the movements of the USD/bitcoin price over the course of the quarters, price fluctuations do not in any way impact the underlying inbuilt payments system of bitcoin.""  He made it clear that the company is not adversely affected by such fluctuations in the short term:  ""Short-term fluctuations do not affect our continued progress, and we are well funded to operate our business and work towards achieving our near-term goals around managing our mining capacity and launching our cutting-edge software products.""  Tsvetnenko went on to describe the bitcoin payments system as a ""truly disruptive technology"".  Growing bitcoin cache  The company reported mining a total of 6,140 BTC during the third quarter of 2014, bringing its cumulative bitcoin holdings to 8,500 BTC as of 30th September.  DigitalBTC indicated that substantial bitcoin mining operations had started just a few months earlier, generating approximately 7,200 BTC in the 3.5 months leading up to its previous June 30th report.  DigitalBTC has now mined upwards of 13,340 BTC, having commenced operations less than seven months ago.  The company liquidated 6,290 of those coins through its trade desk, yielding revenue of $3.2m. The average selling price over the period was $510 per bitcoin – substantially higher than the price at press time.  Bitcoin has been trading at sub-$500 prices since late August, and stands at around $382 per coin today.  The volume of bitcoins traded through the company's trade desk in the third quarter was an increase of around 36% compared with June's figures.  In its report, DigitalBTC also mentioned a recently announced deal to procure cheaper electricity, which resulted in 40% cheaper power across half of the company's power requirements. The company announced the deal in late August, saying its new Icelandic mining centre would be powered by 100% renewable energy at substantially lower prices than before.  The company also reported the purchase of additional BitFury mining hardware valued at $1.14m, which increased its mining capacity by about 90%.  Entering the consumer space  While digitalBTC's primary focus over the past two quarters was on mining, the company has also made it clear that one of its goals was to develop and launch consumer-oriented products.  Two of these products have already launched through digitalBTC's new consumer brand, digitalX.  The first new offering is digitalX Pocket, a bitcoin payments platform with mobile and web wallets. Users can pre-enrol now, pending the platform's imminent launch.  DigitalX Minsty  , a mining and trading platform, is the firm's second consumer product. Minsty has been designed to allow users to lease the company's mining rigs, or use their own equipment, to mine a variety of cryptocurrencies, all backed by an integrated trading platform.  Additionally, digitalX Direct is a liquidity provision platform designed for various bitcoin businesses, ranging from ATM operators to hedge funds.  A digitalX API is in the works, which should allow third-party developers to integrate the firm's services on their platforms. DigitalBTC's launch customer for digitalX Direct was the Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment fund (GABI) – a cryptocurrency hedge fund – which made its first bitcoin investment via digitalBTC last month.

42398000,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbF8gn,1413814777,Asia's Largest Business Forum Shines Spotlight on Bitcoin,"Bitcoin made a prominent mainstream appearance in South Korea last week at a special session of the 15th annual World Knowledge Forum in Seoul.  The largest business forum in Asia, WKF is a prestigious three-day event designed to foster discussion about the future and potential major issues that may arise.  It also featured guest speakers including former president of France Nicolas Sarkozy, former Japanese prime minister Yukio Hatoyama, and leaders from various international organizations and some of South Korea's largest companies.  Bitcoin panel  A panel discussion and question-and-answer session devoted to bitcoin were included for the first time on the event's final day, organized in part by local company Coinplug and Professor Peter In, the Associate Dean of Korea University's Graduate School of Computer and Information Communications.  The Bitcoin Foundation's Jinyoung Lee Englund and bitcoin evangelist Roger Ver were key speakers at the session along with Professor In, introducing bitcoin to a crowd composed mostly (but not exclusively) of cryptocurrency neophytes and a selection of curious local media.  Speakers told of bitcoin's origins, current structure and promise for the future while acknowledging the technical and political challenges it faces.  Questions from the WKF audience included whether regulatory forces would manage to spoil bitcoin's promise, and how Korean businesses could benefit from using the technology.  Local opinions  Hyun Jung Ryu, a reporter with major news outlet Chosun Biz, told CoinDesk that raising awareness is the key to bitcoin's success in Korea, given the country's reputation as a testbed country for everything from cosmetics to devices.  She said:  ""Unfortunately, bitcoin has very low awareness in Korea. I think this is kind of related that Korea finance industry is way behind to the other top countries.""  Most Koreans consider bitcoin an investment vehicle like a stock, said In, the current value of which determined interest levels.  ""If the price is up, many people come to the bitcoin meetup. If not, not many people show up. Not many people understand the implications of its techology potential. We need to educate them first. And it must be revealed from ATMs, vending machines, online shopping malls, and so on.""  Student day  The panel repeated its session the following day at Korea University's 'Bitcoin Expo', held at the computer science department for students who had been unable to attend the WKF events due to cost and classes.  That day's audience consisted of more technically-minded attendees with some knowledge of cryptocurrency technology, asking challenging questions such as how bitcoin could deal with increasing transaction volumes, and whether the Bitcoin Foundation could effectively represent the world of digital currency.  Englund stressed both a global distributed nature and talent working for the cause as the Bitcoin Foundation's key advantages, while Ver repeated his line that participation in bitcoin's economic revolution was strictly voluntary, and beyond prohibition short of shutting down the internet itself.  Ver demonstrated the simplicity of setting up a bitcoin wallet on the main presentation screen, using bitaddress.org to create key sets and then funding it with $10 from his mobile phone, using blockchain.info to show the instant results.  As a lesson in security, Ver noted that he had revealed the wallet's private key during setup, and asked anyone in the audience with the necessary skills to steal his money. Within five minutes, his bitcoins had a new owner.  Bitcoin in South Korea  While bitcoin in Korea is dealing with the same chicken-egg dilemma of acceptance and service provision, there has been a recent influx of investment into bitcoin ventures from inside the country and overseas, with Coinplug now totalling $3.3m, Korbit $3.6m, and Devign Lab $200,000.  Coinplug's Richard Yun, demonstrating his company's bitcoin ATM at the Seoul bitcoin meetup in Gangnam's Cafe Sedona, said there are now plans to produce the machines in quantity and place them in various locations, including one at Korea University itself.

42397984,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbF8Q4,1413808172,"Bitnet Lands $14.5 Million Series A Funding to Rival Coinbase, BitPay","A group of traditional payments veterans has raised $14.5m to launch Bitnet, a bitcoin payments processor that aims to entice the largest merchants in the world to accept bitcoin.  Led by Highland Capital Partners, Bitnet's Series A round also included Rakuten, Japan’s largest e-commerce site. Notably, Rakuten is not only providing funding, it will use Bitnet's bitcoin payments software.  John McDonnell, CEO of Bitnet, told CoinDesk the company has an enterprise-level platform for large retailers to begin accepting bitcoin and that it expects its offering to compete against established market players such as BitPay, Coinbase and GoCoin.  McDonnell said:  “We saw bitcoin as an opportunity to reduce direct costs of processing and eliminate a lot of the ancillary costs of handling credit cards.”  Migrating to bitcoin  The executives at Bitnet worked formerly at Visa, and many were also previously involved in a company called Cybersource, which was purchased by Visa in 2010 for $2bn to handle its online payment infrastructure.  “What we saw was an opportunity to bring that payments domain expertise from running the world’s biggest e-commerce payment gateway [to bitcoin],"" McDonnell said.  The Bitnet CEO explained that it is fairly simple for small merchants to begin accepting bitcoin. However, big organizations could experience problems integrating cryptocurrency payments given their often complex internal financial systems.  McDonnell said that some large merchants pay upwards of 10% on credit card transactions, after paying for internal processing and fraud prevention expenses. Bitnet sees an opportunity for big companies to save money by moving from credit cards to bitcoin over time.  Addressing complexity  Bitnet likes to define itself as a enterprise bitcoin payments company and aims to bring a complete bitcoin payments platform to its customers.  McDonnell said that, prior to Bitnet, there were unresolved issues large companies faced when accepting credit cards that have not been addressed in accepting bitcoin payments. This, he reasons, is why more large retailers have yet to accept bitcoin payments.  Most large companies have to feed payments through what McDonnell described as a large “Tower of Babel” backend system, where money must flow through databases and enterprise resource systems in order for organizational operations to run smoothly.  “The big retailers mostly outsource their commerce activity to enterprise resource planning systems providers like Oracle or SAP,” he said.  The Bitnet team's prior experience makes them acutely aware of this, McDonnell continued, and as a result, the company's software is built with these particular issues in mind.  Playing catch-up  With the Series A funding, Bitnet enters a competitive field of bitcoin payment processors, which all have a head start in the race to sign up merchants and capture market share.  Bitnet said that despite its late entrance into the field, it is confident its solution will provide it a competitive advantage in the space.  “We have spoken with the largest retailers in the world,” said McDonnell. “And the recurring theme is, ‘Yes, we’re looking at bitcoin. Yes, we understand the benefits of it’.”  The industry, he said, while already full of bitcoin payment processors, needs a startup with a roster of payments veterans:  “What we see with the incumbent providers [is that they] are software guys or bitcoin guys trying to figure out payments.""  Signing up a retail giant like Rakuten as an early client could further help the startup gain traction with large enterprises who are interested in bitcoin.  Bitnet has been operating with a sales team in San Francisco and an engineering contingent in Belfast, Ireland, since quietly raising a seed round back in January.  “From our perspective, as payments veterans, this is the most exciting development in FinTech, ever,” McDonnell concluded.

42397998,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbF8cr,1413805194,Market Weekly: Bitcoin Price Serene Amid Market Turmoil,"Markets were on a rollercoaster last week, with wild swings of hundreds of points on major indices. The Wall Street Journal even fired up a liveblog to provide minute-by-minute commentary on the unfolding turmoil.  Amazingly, I'm not talking about the bitcoin markets. Instead, US equity markets ended their most volatile trading week in years, with the benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average down as much as 207 points on Friday and Brent crude oil falling below the $80 a barrel mark.  Bitcoin trading was languid by comparison. The price according to the CoinDesk BPI began the week at $375.80 and closed at $388.75.  The week's trading hit a high of $407.12 on Tuesday and a low of $370.27 on Thursday. That's just $36.85 from peak to trough, or a swing of 9 percentage points.  This wasn't lost on Everett Rosenfeld of CNBC.com, who noted the flat bitcoin price as wider financial markets' prices began to plummet on Thursday. He wrote:  ""While US equities markets tank, and gold is hanging near a one-month high, one famously volatile currency is roughly flat on the week.""  Bitcoin's correlation to wider markets  Bitcoin's relationship to other assets has been the subject of research at Pantera Capital. In June, it examined (PDF) bitcoin's correlation to seven major global equity indices, the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note, crude oil, gold and the dollar index.  The hedge fund tracked bitcoin's correlation agains these major measures over the 12 months ended June 2014 and found no correlation between the cryptocurrency and established asset classes.  ""Bitcoin's correlation with other asset classes over the last 12 months has been essentially zero. In other words, bitcoins 'march to their own drummer',"" the fund wrote in its weekly research note.  It's worth remembering where we were this time last week. The 'BearWhale' had just been vanquished and bulls were ascendant. While market watchers like BitMEX's Arthur Hayes warned that $330-350 was a fair price target, the cryptocurrency's boosters had other ideas. His current price target is $430-$450.  While total traded volume declined to 2.52m coins traded, a drop of 15% compared to last week, there was some movement among share of traded volume among the major exchanges.  BTC China  continued its upward trajectory, passing second-placed Huobi on Friday and opening up a gap of more than 20,000 BTC traded by Sunday. The ascendant exchange also bucked the wider downward trend, posting a volume increase of 13%.  At almost 60%, Bitstamp posted the largest decline over the week. Trading on Bitfinex, meanwhile, dropped sharply over the week, placing it below Lakebtc and ANXbtc.  A store of value in Venezuela's default?  The bitcoin price has been resilient, holding steady for much of the week. Is this set to continue?  NASDAQ's Martin Tillier suggests that forex traders are watching the US dollar for signs of weakness as the Federal Reserve hints that it may keep its current quantitive easing regime in place. As the dollar has weakened, the bitcoin price has strengthened.  ""Bitcoin has become a very volatile, highly leveraged way of playing dollar moves for many traders. To purists who believe in bitcoin as a counter to the problems inherent in fiat currency this is anathema,"" Tillier wrote.  All this volatility, particularly in the oil markets, could signal more unrest ahead. Economists are on vigil for Venezuela, in particular, which is on the brink of defaulting on its foreign debt as oil prices drop. Noted Harvard economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff have written that the chances of a Venezuela default are ""close to 100%"".  As Venezuela teeters on the brink, its citizens may turn to bitcoin to bypass currency controls and to preserve the value of their holdings. The Venezuelan currency, the bolivar, has almost halved in the last two years against the US dollar.  ""Even though bitcoin is volatile, it's still safer than the national currency,"" a recent economics graduate told Reuters earlier this month.  If Venezuela is anything to go by, bitcoin may still prove its worth as a store of value. That's good news for believers in bitcoin's long-term prospects.

42397993,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbF8Yv,1413802811,Bitcoin Derivatives Platform BTC.sx Partners With Asian Exchange itBit,"London-based bitcoin derivatives platform BTC.sx has partnered with global exchange itBit to integrate its BTC-USD trading currency pair with the bitcoin exchange's existing offerings.  Joseph Lee, co-founder and CEO of BTC.sx, said the bitcoin exchange ecosystem is now entering its second phase of development, one he believes will be characterized by advanced financial services that go beyond simple currency exchange.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Lee explained how the integration will aim to bolster the current platform itBit users have come to expect:  “The platform essentially emulates what an E*Trade platform would be. We’ve tried to set up a professional foreign exchange trading platform in bitcoin for bitcoin, which we believe we’re the first to fill that niche.”  In turn, director of business development Anthony Lewis indicated that the integration allows itBit to extend a more diverse set of offerings to customers.  ""They offer a solid, feature-rich and easy-to-use platform and we are very glad to be working together,” he said.  The announcement comes at a time when bitcoin’s exchange ecosystem is seeing an increasing number of exchanges embrace derivatives, swaps and other more advanced financial tools. OKCoin, for example, introduced margin trading to its platform in June, joining established exchanges with such offerings including Europe’s BTC-e and Hong Kong’s Bitfinex.  New depth to exchange market  Lee said that the partnership will also bring nuance to a market he believes is still characterized by basic services catering to investors without more tenured financial backgrounds.  In a typical foreign exchange market, Lee remarked, traders would not be expected to provide both US dollars and euros should they be looking to trade that currency pair, a development that essentially takes place when bitcoin traders must deposit US dollars to buy bitcoin.  ""It’s important to draw an analogy to the typical foreign exchange market,"" Lee said. ""An exchange is more of a money trading service, where they’ll match buyers and sellers, but an exchange isn’t necessarily a trading platform.""  Instead, itBit users will be able to make small deposits on the exchange in order to wager on the performance of bitcoin, whether its value will rise (long) or fall (short). BTC.sx will then purchase bitcoins on an exchange and report that the deal has been completed.  If the trade goes in the customer's favor, they'll be credited with the profit; if not, they'll lose the deposit. Notably, trades can take place entirely in bitcoin.  Partners in the making  Lee explained that the itBit and BTC.sx teams have been looking for ways to collaborate since the Asia Bitcoin Singapore 2013 conference, where BTC.sx was selected for seed-stage startup fund Seedcoin's incubator program.  There, the two teams met, finding a common ground with their traditional financial backgrounds.  ""What we were quite excited about was the real potential for trading derivatives to take a niche in the market that doesn’t exist,"" Lee said. ""An exchange is a very important part of that because that’s where the actual settlement occurs.""  BTC.sx indicates it is seeking to add more exchange partners while it expands its presence in Asia. The company's service is now localised in five languages, including simplified and traditional Chinese.  Still, Lee sees the partnership as less about BTC.sx's regional goals and more about its search for partners that share its global vision for bitcoin.  ""ItBit is a very, very trusted name out there and the professionality that they aspire to, every other exchange should work toward,"" Lee said, adding:  ""I don’t think they’re in the top five exchanges, but I’d expect them in the very near future to be one of the top exchanges by volume.""

42397986,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbF8S2,1413800557,Chinese Exchange Yuanbao Now Lets Customers Mortgage Their Bitcoin,"Chinese exchanges have discovered another model in their quest to add new platform services: fiat currency-based peer-to-peer (P2P) loans using bitcoins and other digital assets as collateral.  While most such services are aimed at large bitcoin holders who wish to make use of their holding's value without actually selling, some exchanges allow mortgaging of other assets like litecoin, car registration and even telephone numbers.  Unlike bitcoin-related P2P lending platforms in other countries, such as BTCJam, these Chinese services do not actually lend digital currencies. Instead, users borrow and lend fiat currency only.  One such service is Yuanbao.com, operated by a partnership between developers of the altcoin 'yuanbao' and exchange BTCTrade. Yuanbao.com offers loans in Chinese yuan (CNY) to borrowers prepared to leave either bitcoin, litecoin or yuanbao (the coin) with the exchange as collateral.  Borrowers set terms  Borrowers may then borrow up to 60% of the digital assets' value in CNY. Borrowers also set the terms of the loan, including timeframe (15 days to one year) and interest rate, which is usually between 10% and 30%. Their loan proposal is then posted on the platform for lenders to consider.  Lenders accept a loan with conditions most suitable to their needs and decide how much to lend (this enables borrowers to borrow from multiple lenders, staying within an overall limit).  Borrowers are taking on a degree of risk by using such assets. If one does not pay back a loan on time, or the assets depreciate in market value to a certain point, those assets are transferred to the lender to cover their loss.  Anonymous borrowing  Yuanbao.com spokesperson Robin Guo said lenders come from all backgrounds, drawn by the attractive return rates and the added security provided by the digital asset mortgage.  Borrowers would generally come from the digital currency community and are not asked any questions, so long as they provide sufficient digital assets to back up the loan.  Guo said:  ""They could be mining equipment producers, mining pool owners, traders, etc. Basically, anyone who has digital assets and doesn't want to sell them or is not happy with the current coin market price, can be our borrowers.""  Paying electricity bills at a mining operation was just one possible reason for borrowing money, Guo added.  Yuanbao.com is not levying additional fees on the loans for an initial period as a promotion to attract new users. It does, however, charge a standard 0.5% fee (in CNY) to withdraw fiat currency to a bank or payment service provider.  Guo said the service had proved ""very popular"" so far, with at least 2.5m CNY loaned since the platform launched on 12th September.  Creative competition  Other similar P2P loan services have recently launched in China, including Dangpu by 'big three' exchange Huobi, and 8R.com from exchange CHBTC in partnership with Shenzhen BaRong Internet Financial Services Co Ltd.  Dangpu (which is Mandarin for 'pawn shop') currently offers bitcoin-backed loans under a model nearly identical to Yuanbao.com, and is planning to expand the service to litecoin and other digital assets with good market liquidity in future.  According to its website, Dangpu has lent and borrowed a total of around 5m CNY since launching the service a month ago, with one loan being issued at 1.5m CNY.  Lucky numbers  8R.com gives an idea what those other assets might be offered, allowing collateral use of bitcoins, litecoins, and auspicious vehicle or phone numbers. The platform, according to a CHBTC spokesperson, has processed 1.414m CNY in loans since launching on 12th September.  Betty Zhang, of Chinese digital currency news site Bitell, explained that phone and car registration numbers featuring certain numerals were of high value in China, especially if they occurred several times in a row.  ""That's a typical Chinese characteristic,"" she said.  ""Six, eight and nine are lucky numbers in China. In Chinese, six means everything goes smoothly, eight represents fortune and wealth, while nine symbolizes eternal and supreme right. It used to be a royal number which could be used by the emperor exclusively.""  People will pay a lot more to obtain such numbers and they are considered assets of value which can be mortgaged – at least by China's digital currency exchanges, if not by its banks.

42397989,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbF8Uz,1413792845,BTC China Adds Mining Pool and Merchant Payment Services,"BTC China has announced it is expanding its range of digital currency services with the addition of a new mining pool and merchant payments processing.  It marks another step on the company's transition from simple exchange to an integrated services platform, and reflects a recent diversification trend among Chinese digital currency businesses.  The company said in a statement:  ""BTC China's expanded portfolio covers all aspects of the digital economy, allowing a user to mine bitcoin and litecoin in its mining pool, store it in BTC China’s wallet, pay for goods through its payment gateway, and trade for fiat on the exchange.""  Users will now be able to access all of BTC China's services, including the existing exchange and bitcoin/litecoin wallets, with a single user account.  The mining pool is not a cloud-mining or subscription service, but a pool for existing miners to join. At this stage it is for bitcoin mining only, and instructions are in Chinese language only.  Mining pool  BTC China CEO Bobby Lee said the company is remaining at the forefront of an industry that has grown immensely in the past year.  Lee said:  ""You can mine bitcoin, store it safely, pay for goods and services, trade bitcoin, and exchange for fiat, all on BTC China's new platform. Moving forward, BTC China will continue to innovate and set industry standards for service, security and innovation.""  The mining pool implements the PROP (proportional) payout scheme, whereby blocks are paid out proportionally to the number of shares a contributor has earned. BTC China promises 100% transparency in its hashrate distribution, with no hidden hashrate reductions.  Lower fees will apply to users who send their mined coins to other BTC China services instead of external addresses.  Payment processor  To showcase its new payment processing system, the company has already partnered with regional merchants who are willing to accept bitcoins.  These include Shenzhoufu Hong Kong, an online transaction provider that facilitates payments between online game operators and users, and Aicaikehttp://www.aicaike.com/invest/btc, a 'P2F' (peer-to-firm) financial information publishing platform.  Launched in 2011, Shanghai-based BTC China is the world's oldest continuously operating bitcoin exchange and, like its direct competitors in China, it is one of the world's largest by trade volume.  The company currently supports bitcoin and litecoin trading and deposits/withdrawals in USD, CNY and Hong Kong dollars (HKD).
