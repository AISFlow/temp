42427234,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK11zh,1484092269,Is the 'Zcrash' Over? Zcash's Price is Finding a Floor at $50,"The price of the blockchain-backed asset zcash (ZEC) has shown signs of settling down over the last several trading sessions, experiencing only modest changes in its long volatile value.  Since the start of trading on 7th January, the value of the tokens that power the zcash blockchain have mostly fluctuated between $44 and $48 on CoinMarketCap, a range that tightened further today when ZEC moved between $45 and $46.50.  At the time of report, 1 ZEC was trading at $45.43.  This relative calm offers a sharp contrast to the wild volatility that ZEC experienced in the months since the cryptocurrency went live. (As previously reported, Zcash has managed to generate significant visibility through its use of zero-knowledge proofs called zk-SNARKs, a technology that lets users conceal the amount of transactions).  Excitement about the innovation fueled fervent speculation (ZEC reached roughly 3,300 BTC, more than $2m in October), before falling to $500 by the end of the month. By mid-November, 1 ZEC was trading for less than $100.  Yet that instability appears to be fading.  Over the last 30 days, the price of zcash has declined just 8%, hitting a high of $56 and a low of $34, according to data from CoinGecko – modest peaks and troughs by cryptocurrency standards.  Price discovery  While promising, it may be difficult to determine whether ZEC's settling price signals an opportunity for investors, as experts appear split on the matter.  At least in the short-term, ZEC prices have neared their true value, according to Tim Enneking, chairman of cryptocurrency hedge fund EAM. However, he said he would prefer to wait and see before backing the digital currency with investment directly.  Whaleclub  COO Petar Zivkovski also struck a hesitant tone, arguing that he believes a nascent market and the strong chance of competition means there are too many unknowns at present.  ""There's also still so little supply on the market that I don't think price discovery is really happening yet,"" he continued.  Overall, it seems the jury’s out on how much adoption the digital currency will enjoy and how well its price will perform going forward.  Zivkovski said:  ""There's still time to decide whether ZEC is a good long term bet.""

42427229,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK11rh,1484084422,Julian Assange Just Read Out a Bitcoin Block Hash to Prove He Was Alive,"Wikileaks founder Julian Assange used data from the blockchain as a ""proof of life"" during a Reddit ask-me-anything session today.  For months, some of Assange's ardent Internet fans have been theorizing that he had died. However, Assange responded in a livestreamed talk, calling the theories ""silly"" and confirming that the video wasn't prerecorded by reading off the most recent block hash (a string of letters and numbers, unique to block 447506 on the bitcoin blockchain).  Assange said in the talk:  ""Thinking about real-time proof-of-life, intellectually the most interesting one is to take the most recent block in the bitcoin blockchain.""  The idea is that as a bitcoin block hash is hard to produce, taking a global network of powerful computers to calculate it in an average interval of 10 minutes, it would be almost impossible to guess the string of letters and numbers.  However, that wasn't to say that some doubters didn't emerge.  The first time reading off the hash he made a small mistake. (Users in the Twitch.tv chat room sidebar then reacted with messages like ""DEAD"" and ""DEAD LUL"").  For Assange, the move isn't exactly surprising though.  The statements come as the latest in what has been his long-standing support for the digital currency. Wikileaks was the first prominent organization to back the technology, using it as far back as 2012 to route value in the face of a blockade against its financial resources.

42427223,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK11dh,1484075802,Report: Bitcoin ETF Could Amass $300 Million in Assets (If Approved),"A new investor note published today by analyst Needham & Company projects that a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) could attract as much as $300m in new assets in its first week alone.  Writing about the potential impact of an ETF on the nascent market, analyst Spencer Bogart speculates that such an approval is likely to have a ""profoundly positive"" effect on the price of bitcoin, and that the $300m estimate is ""conservative"".  ""The resulting effort to source the underlying bitcoin for the trust would likely drive the price of bitcoin up significantly,"" Bogart writes.  In the scenario, he told CoinDesk that $300m in assets would mean that the ETF's authorized participants would need to source this volume of bitcoin for the ETF, sending prices higher. (Bitcoin's market cap was just over $14.5bn at press time).  The catch, however, is that Bogart doesn't believe one of the major bitcoin ETF filings – the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF, proposed by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss – is likely to be approved.  Though the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to make a final decision on the filing by 11th March, Bogart speculates that the ETF's ""probability of approval is very low"".  The note reads:  ""Taken together, we think the positive effect that a bitcoin ETF would have on the price of bitcoin is vastly underappreciated and that the probability of approval is drastically overestimated within the industry.""  Ultimately, Bogart projects that the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF has a less than 25% chance of being approved due to a ""confluence of fear, uncertainty and doubt coupled with basic incentives at the SEC"".  Bogart goes on to label any approval a ""low probability"" event with ""very significant upside"".  Curveball approval  Yet, the document also highlights a suspected peculiarity in the law that could enable the ETF to be approved – without any action from the SEC.  Highlighted in the note is language that Needham says indicates could result in a scenario in which the SEC doesn't disprove the filing, and as a result, it is automatically approved.  The note suggests Needham isn't sure if it's interpreting its findings correctly, but that the possibility could add an interesting dynamic to the March decision.  ""We think this is interesting only because, politically, it might be easier for the individuals responsible for making the decision to let the decision go to auto-approval—which essentially only means they lack of a reason to disapprove—than it is to stick a stamp of approval on the rule change,"" it reads.  In statements, however, Bogart added that he believes this possibility to be ""highly unlikely"".

42427228,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK11ph,1484058647,Sweden's Blockchain Land Registry to Begin Testing in March,"A public-private effort in Sweden to record land titles on a blockchain is set to begin public testing this March.  Spearheaded by the Swedish National Land Survey and blockchain startup ChromaWay, the project was revealed in June to have support from consulting firm Kairos Future and telephone service provider Telia. Now, the project is moving ahead with the addition of two banks that specialize in mortgages, Landshypotek and SBAB, CoinDesk has learned.  ChromaWay CEO Henrik Hjelte said that the sandbox release would seek to test the platform from a business, legal and security perspective, while allowing the public to test the interface and back-end.  ""The system will not be connected to live data in March yet, but it will demonstrate what it would look like if it were to be populated with real data and integrated into the different actors' services,"" Hjelte told CoinDesk.  He added that, at that point, more users from differing backgrounds are expected to join the effort, stating:  ""We will invite regulators, governmental agencies and other actors in the space to review the platform and blockchain technology to provide feedback on the project from a legal, business and technical standpoint.""  The goal, he said, is to then open source the project at a later date.  When launched, the project could be the first working example of an idea that has long captured the public's imagination.  Since 2015, various governments, including Honduras and Georgia, have been said to be considering such systems, though none has seen large-scale testing.  Fence mending  Before launch, however, Hjelte said there's more work to be done.  Of note is that he said there are differences between SBAB and Landshypotek's systems that now need to be translated to a common blockchain system.  For the trial, the blockchain will be based on ChromaWay's technology, which participants had previously said will provide transparency and privacy to the shared registry.  ""We are looking to mend those pain points in the sandbox application that will be released in March,"" he continued.  Hjelte concluded:  ""Right now we are finalizing the property transaction contract, which structure will keep improving as we get more feedback from the different actors.""

42427222,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK11bh,1484057049,"Blockchain for Mortgages: Compelling, But Premature?","If there's an industry that cries out for the efficiencies and data integrity that blockchain tech promises, it's undoubtedly the US residential mortgage business.  First off, there's the size of the business. At last count, according to the Federal Reserve, there were about $10tn-worth of residential mortgages outstanding, with about $2tn in new loans being originated in a good year.  Then, there's the amount of data – most of it sensitive – that goes into and supports every loan.  ""A mortgage application requires hundreds of documents and very sensitive data,"" Leo Loomie, senior vice president of client services at Digital Risk LLC, a mortgage processing provider, told CoinDesk. ""W-2s, income statements, asset statements, bank statements, Social Security numbers – and all of that has to change hands numerous times over a variety of channels: fax, email, mobile phone.""  Mortgages are complex financial instruments, agrees Jason Nadeau, executive vice president at blockchain startup Factom, writing in a recent issue of MReport, a mortgage industry publication.  ""To process a mortgage from start to finish, you're looking at many documents, all with multiple versions, created by multiple parties and multiple entities editing and revising. Combined, that could be thousands of document versions, data points, all variable to revision,"" he said.  And that’s just at the front end, so there's increasing interest in how blockchain might be able to solve real-world workflow problems in real estate.  ""The mortgage use cases for blockchain are super interesting,"" Loomie said, indicating he is optimistic about the technology and its potential.  Loomie added:  ""These are high-dollar transactions that are very painful. And anytime you can remove friction from the process is where you're going to get traction.""  So, how exactly will blockchain benefit the mortgage business? Experts see three ways in which they believe the industry could be impacted:  Better recordkeeping  The first with a notable consensus is recordkeeping.  In a June 2016 report, Pamela Johnston, principal and partner, and Tim Davis, managing director for banking and capital markets at PwC, assert that blockchains could provide ""immutable proof"" that loan estimates were sent within timelines required by regulation.  ""In the mortgage servicing process, blockchain could track the movement of payments. And in the secondary markets, it might provide transparency about the ownership of underlying assets,"" the report said, continuing:  ""We think blockchain could be relevant at every stage.""  Nadeau, too, sees much the same value in the technology.  He indicated that blockchains could help ensure documents and data are ""vetted through compliance checks"" with ""proof built directly into the process"".  Information sharing  Loomie noted that the ability to create a ""fingerprint of your mortgage"" that can be transferred ""instantaneously"" between institutions is equally appealing.  ""All of the entire mortgage package, including the contract, can all live in a blockchain,"" he suggested.  Eli Stern, partner at Ernst & Young, sees this benefit as well, noting that blockchains could take out the ""operational heavy lifting"" in mortgage markets.  ""All of the due diligence, all of the reporting, all of that could be streamlined and to some extent all of the effort around it would be removed. That would just tremendously streamline the whole process – from asset origination all the way through to securitization execution,"" he said.  Stern noted that recent regulations, such as the Dodd-Frank Act have put pressure on disclosures at the asset level.  ""It's become tremendously cumbersome for securitizers,” Stern told CoinDesk. ""Having data that is completely reliable and instantly accessible would make complying with all of this regulation just so much easier and reduce costs and make everything faster.""  Cost savings  Reducing costs will likely be the driving force behind mortgage industry adoption of blockchain. ""When you talk about instantaneous and secure, you are talking about cost reduction,"" Loomie said.  But, how much exactly?  Capgemini Consulting, in a recent report, entitled estimates those savings could amount to 11% to 22% on average processing fees per loan of $4,350, or about $480 to $957 per loan.  While a lot of those savings will be passed on to the consumer, some of them will be retained by industry participants, meaning mortgage banking should become a more profitable business, according to Loomie.  Testing underway  While all of this sounds compelling and long overdue, how close is the mortgage industry to actually adopting blockchain into its processes?  In some places, it already has been.  In October, Bank of China and HSBC began testing blockchain tech on a property valuation system for home loans in Hong Kong – one the banks said they plan to go live with shortly.  Loomie said he believes this partnership could but pressure on firms in the US to follow suit.  ""Appraisals are a nightmare right now. Turn times are way up. If you see Bank of China and HSBC implementing it, it's the real deal,"" he said.  Evolution, not revolution  Nevertheless, depending on how and where it is used, experts say blockchain for mortgages could be just around the corner, or it could be years away.  The best way to look at it, then, might be to see it as an evolutionary process, not a revolution that will transform the industry all at once.  ""System and technology transformation is a very time-consuming process and blockchain technology isn't free from that,” notes Angus Champion de Crespigny, financial services blockchain and distributed infrastructure strategy leader at EY.  Champion de Crespigny noted that regulatory considerations aren't to be undervalued by those considering how blockchain could capture value.  Loomie agreed. ""People are still trying to confirm for themselves that this is a real secure enterprise-grade solution. It's also a complicated product and idea. It's not something that's easily grasped,"" he said.  Others, of course, were more bearish in the face of barriers.  ""The reality is, for this to work it's going to take some thought and time,” Bart Cant, founder and community leader of Capgemini’s blockchain practice, told CoinDesk, adding:  ""I don't think the market is ready to make really big investments at this point in time. I don't see it happening very soon.""  Correction: A prior version of this article indicated that Eli Stern was a ""senior manager"" at EY. This has been revised.

In statements, CEO Star Xu said that rumors that the People's Bank of China may enact a ""third-party platform"" to improve exchange security are based on real discussions, but that this dialogue remains theoretical and in its early stages.  Xu noted that the idea would enhance consumer protection by using techniques already in practice at stock exchanges and in peer-to-peer FinTech platforms.

42399536,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjh2O,1484053232,Bitstamp to Launch New Ripple Trading Pairs,"Bitstamp is launching new markets for Ripple’s XRP digital asset.  The launch, set for 17th January, will see the exchange offer trading pairs for USD/XRP and EUR/XRP. The company already serves as a Ripple gateway (where money enters or leaves the network) and hosts a bitcoin-denominated market for the digital asset.  Bitstamp is kicking off the new offerings with a two-part program that will see it give rebates on trading fees, as well as incentives to market makers who bring liquidity to the exchange, though Ripple says the details of the latter are still being finalized.  The move comes during a period of change for the San Francisco-based startup. Chris Larsen stepped down as CEO in November, handing the reins to former AOL exec and then-Ripple president Brad Garlinghouse.  Yet it’s the startup’s growing visibility among the world’s financial institutions that’s perhaps more at play here.  In September, Ripple raised a $55m Series B round that included support from big banks like Standard Chartered, Siam Commercial Bank and Banco Santander. A month later, the startup would disclose details of a test involving a dozen global banks that tested the use of XRP to provide liquidity to bank accounts.  Miguel Vias, the former CME global head of precious metals and metal options who joined Ripple as head of XRP markets in November, said that the launch fits into the startup’s broader plan of getting XRP on more exchanges.  He told CoinDesk:  “We really want nice, wholesome, good liquid activity on day one so we’re having deep conversations with our market makers, some of whom have been around for a long time.”  According to Bitstamp, the move was driven by user demand. At the same time, it suggests a deepening role for the firm as a gateway within the Ripple network.  “It’s clear that Ripple and its digital asset XRP are a natural fit for the stringent requirements of the EU license we hold here at Bitstamp,” CEO Nejc Kodrič said in a statement. “There is also high demand from our customers for XRP trading and so we are looking forward to continue responding to their needs in a highly regulated and compliant trading environment.”  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple.

42399532,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjgzR,1484049632,National Science Foundation to Fund Blockchain Security Research,"The National Science Foundation (NSF) is seeking to fund research into how technologies like blockchain can improve the resiliency of cyber-infrastructure.  According to a grant proposal solicitation initially released last year and updated at the start of 2017, the NSF is looking to fund research to the tune of $8.5m. The agency is looking to grant between seven and nine awards of up to $1m apiece.  While not explicitly focused on blockchain, the grant does invoke the technology as one topics of exploration once funds have been granted. The NSF is a US government agency that funds scientific research in a variety of areas.  As the solicitation noted:  “With the growing amount of remote instruments and the increasing amount of data being collected from multiple, often remote, wireless and mobile sensors, science is increasingly distributed and virtual. Solutions such as the introduction of blockchain technology are needed to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of data as it traverses multiple environments such as mobile, cloud, campus, and Internet networks.”  It’s not the first time that the NSF has thrown its weight behind research involving the technology.  In mid-2015, the agency awarded roughly $3m in grant funding for a cryptocurrency research project involving participants from Cornell, the University of Maryland and the University of California Berkeley.  On a broader scale, the US government has moved in the past year and a half to promote or fund blockchain projects or startups.  For this latest grant round, the NSF is looking for university-based teams, as well as nonprofits and research outfits, to submit proposals. The proposal deadline is 1st March, according to the solicitation sheet.

42399538,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjh5L,1484046723,Toward Better Security and Governance With Blockchain,"Valery Vavilov is the CEO and founder of Bitfury Group, a leading blockchain company that delivers software, hardware, mining and consulting solutions focused on the technology.  In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Vavilov discusses his vision for the future of blockchain technology, and why he believes it will prove key to providing a more secure and inclusive world.  2017 is here. There is tremendous optimism for the future, but there is also reason for tremendous concern.  Cybersecurity was one of the biggest stories of 2016. Now everyone is looking for a better solution – and not a moment too soon. With our current Internet-based infrastructure, every database, every server and every asset is vulnerable.  This is, in many ways, because the Internet was not built for security – cybersecurity describes protections added to a vulnerable system.  And while many digital natives were raised on the understanding that cybersecurity is an integral part of life, others are only beginning to understand this pervasive threat. The real story of 2016 is much larger than cybersecurity – it's a story of broken systems and declining trust in institutions.  Across the globe, many fundamental themes remain constant.  People want to provide for their loved ones; institutions are broken and sometimes fully corrupt; barriers to industry and entrepreneurship can sometimes seem unsurpassable. High unemployment, growing income disparities, poor or inaccessible education – some combination of these problems affect billions of people across the globe.  A microcosm of this dreary landscape can be found in contemporary banking.  Exclusionary banking policies often make it impossible for low-income populations and new businesses to open accounts; the costs of transferring money and assets within countries and across borders stultify mobility and innovation in the globalized economy. More broadly, fear of imminent and uncertain shifts in the tectonic plates of geopolitical power have given rise to pervasive timidity – which is never good for growth.  It's a bleak picture, but there's good news. A major tool has emerged to help us combat each of these universal challenges.  Progress ahead  In the next few years – maybe three, maybe five, maybe 10 – anyone, anywhere will be able to transfer any asset to anywhere on earth from the palm of their hand. Through a new system called the bitcoin blockchain, unparalleled ease of access, trust, transparency and security will become the default across the globe.  It's simple, it’s inexpensive and it’s happening now.  As Wi-Fi access rapidly spreads across the globe, universal access to smart technology is expanding and inevitable. Accompanying this increased opportunity is increased risk. Security is one of the most exciting aspects of the bitcoin blockchain; since its inception eight years ago, it has never been successfully hacked.  Never. Think about that.  In a world where everything from the Nasdaq to the Pentagon has been compromised, the bitcoin blockchain stands as the most secure system on earth. Trust is literally built into the technology and the data is decentralized, stored at no fewer than 5,000 locations around the world.  The bitcoin blockchain does not function without security – security is the lifeblood. On this blockchain, every single exchange is stored in an immutable record – it's unalterable and forever stamped in time.  Every time someone adds a new transaction, it must be verified by the entire decentralized network and therefore becomes more secure.  What's more, the bitcoin blockchain self-audits – any transaction that is illegitimate is caught before it can even be recorded on the ledger. This means attempts at fraud, duplication or tampering are immediately detectable, a security structure unparalleled by any other system.  Realizing a vision  I was born in Latvia – a former territory of the Soviet Union.  When established systems failed in my country, many in my family lost everything. As a boy, I could only dream of helping create a world where arbitrary and unjust reversals of fortune were no longer possible.  The bitcoin blockchain is the beginning of the realization of that dream.  The bitcoin blockchain can set us all down a path toward a brighter, more accessible, more mobile world – one where broken systems are transformed and opportunity is expanded for millions.  No technology is a panacea, but with the further adoption and understanding of the power, potential and security of the bitcoin blockchain, 2017 will help usher in a new era of optimism and trust in institutions.  It's been decades since the Internet disrupted and reorganized the global status-quo. Now, it's the blockchain's turn to change the world.

42399529,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjgtX,1484024417,China's BTCC Welcomes Greater Bitcoin Exchange Oversight,"At least one bitcoin exchange in China is open to the idea that the digital currency could become more well-regulated domestically.  Speaking to CoinDesk today, BTCC CEO Bobby Lee greeted rumors that the People's Bank of China is considering ways to better supervise the industry with enthusiasm, while pushing back against the idea that recent conversations between its executives and the central bank were anything but ordinary.  The comments come in response to a report from China Securities Journal today in which the news source cited undisclosed sources that hinted a ""third-party hosting platform"" might be set up to better protect local investors.  Though Lee indicated he was not aware of such plans, he spoke to why a common platform may be beneficial.  ""In China, stock exchanges are regulated and they have common settlement platforms,"" he said. ""But for bitcoin we're starting at zero.""  But, Lee said changes must go deeper than that. Since it was founded in 2011, Lee noted that his firm has been operating without a license.  He told CoinDesk:  ""It's just like people who sell hats on the street, or sell umbrellas.
