42429357,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxjZh,1530910515,Tezos Investors Got a Chance to Sell This Week – And They Took It,"After waiting nearly a year to get their tokens, the first thing many Tezos investors did was get rid of them.  At least, that seems to be the case according to available market data, which indicates a wave of selling has taken place since the tech backing the crypto asset was released in beta.  All in all, prices fell 34 percent on Monday to $2.00, according to CoinMarketCap. From a Monday high above $4, the price dropped 74 percent to a Friday low of $1.10, before paring losses to reach roughly $1.76 as of press time.  Notably, the sell-off coincided with the first listing of Tezos tokens on an exchange, meaning investors were quick to take advantage of access to liquidity.  On Monday, Gate.io, a smaller exchange that ranks 22rd by 24-hour trading volumes, announced that it would support trading in XTZ or ""tez,"" the native token of the Tezos blockchain. Prior to Gate.io's listing, pricing data had been based on tez proxies – commonly referred to as IOUs – available for trading on HitBTC.  So, while it's still early days, the decline appears to mark a tough first week for a project that raised $232 million in July 2017 in a record-setting initial coin offering (ICO). While Tezos attracted attention for its creative solutions to problems of governance in blockchain networks, it has since made headlines for its own governance struggles.  Even so, for investors who obtained tez at the ICO price of $0.47, selling this week would still be profitable.  As such, observers disagree over whether the decline marks a temporary setback due to profit-taking by a few investors, or a decidedly negative turn in sentiment around a project that was once seen as a way to make blockchain mainstream.  Speaking to investors, observers and network participants, CoinDesk repeatedly heard that the selloff should be attributed to the long wait for liquidity.  Tim Draper, an investor who described himself as a ""long-term hodler"" of the project's tokens, told CoinDesk:  ""There was probably some pent up supply since it took longer than expected for the tokens to launch. Some people probably needed some cash.""  The sudden rush of liquidity to the tez market, due to Gate.io's listing, may also have been a double-edged sword.  While it enabled investors to sell, it likely did not provide enough liquidity – due to the exchange's relatively small trading volumes – to let them sell without causing a sharp downturn in the price.  Just a blip?  Overall, investors in Tezos seem to be putting on a brave face following the price decline.  ""This sell-off is gorgeous,"" one user posted to Reddit, arguing that the exit of ""non-believers"" from the Tezos community would strengthen it. A Twitter user attributed the selloff to ""weak hands.""  Meanwhile, a forum for Tezos traders saw more than one user boast of having bought tens of thousands of tokens in over-the-counter trades – prompting others to request an introduction to the sellers.  Mariano Gadea, head of the Tezos delegation service CeiboXTZ (Tezos holders will soon begin ""delegating"" their tokens to validators, whose job it is to maintain the blockchain in a way analogous to bitcoin's miners), went so far as to claim in an email to CoinDesk:  ""I think there is no price drop as such.""  He explained that the market was undergoing an ""adjustment"" between HitBTC's IOUs and the live Tezos network's native tokens, and expressed confidence that Tezos' market cap ($900 million at the time of writing) would soon rival ethereum's ($47 billion).  Yet, even in the most stubbornly bullish environments, many expressed anxiety about exchange listings, based on the feeling that listings on large exchanges like Binance would attract buyers to the tez market and prop up the price.  A common theme was the blame the Tezos Foundation, the Swiss non-profit that conducted the ICO and launched the Tezos betanet, supposedly deserves for not having secured exchange listings prior to taking the network live.  A foundation spokesman, in an email to CoinDesk, wrote, ""no single entity owns, manages or controls 'Tezos,'"" citing a statement from June. He added, ""exchanges that wish to list Tez are free to do so.""  He declined to comment on issues related to the price.  Or a debacle?  According to another reading, though, Draper's idea that Tezos investors needed cash might have been too generous.  Tezos was pitched as a solution to the persistent governance problems that had plagued bitcoin and other cryptocurrency networks. By introducing a delegated proof-of-stake system – an alternative to bitcoin's proof of work whereby participants vote based on their token holdings – Tezos founders Kathleen and Arthur Breitman saw an opportunity to bring blockchain technology into the mainstream.  Ironically, for a project that aimed to improve governance, the Breitmans – whose company Dynamic Ledger Solutions controlled the code behind the Tezos protocol – soon found themselves locked in a dispute with the president of the Tezos Foundation, Johann Gevers (who stepped down in February, ending the feud).  That fight ate up months of time that could have been devoted to launching the network, sapped the community's energy, and apparently convinced some investors to sell at the first opportunity.  ""It took more than expected … to have the network live due to the issues publicly known that foundation went through,"" said Gadea. ""This delay caused some frustration on those investors who decided to claim their tokens and move them away rapidly.""  Recent months have provided the market with additional reasons to worry – aside from infighting among Tezos leadership. EOS, another delegated proof of stake blockchain focused on governance, has suffered several setbacks since launching last month, which have led the organization behind the network's design to propose an overhaul of its ""constitution.""  James Sowers, who invested in the Tezos ICO, told CoinDesk:  ""Maybe the market is anticipating an EOS-like debacle.""  It is also possible that steep price declines will characterize the launches of several much-hyped ICO projects, now that a feverish crypto bull market has given way to a bear market.  Alok Vasudev, an angel investor who is not invested in Tezos, but knows the project, said, ""I think early volatility will be the norm as these high-profile projects come to market."" He added, ""lots of folks invested expecting much shorter times to liquidity. I'd expect selloffs at launch and after lockups expire for a lot of projects.""  If the Tezos selloff is ""gorgeous,"" then, the community – and the communities of other cryptocurrencies – might have more beauty to look forward to in the months to come.

42429371,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxk1h,1530894910,Bitcoin's Price Declines Over Q2 for First Time on Record,"In the case of bitcoin's Q2 price movements, it turns out history didn't repeat.  As the three-month period came to a close this week, the final figures indicate bitcoin fell 8 percent according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), snapping a 7-year win streak for the market's leading cryptocurrency.  As seen in the table below, bitcoin had always put on a good show in the second quarter. For instance, BTC's 1,964 percent rally in Q2 2011 is its best quarterly performance ever.  Clearly, history was on bitcoin's side and hence, beleaguered bulls were expecting BTC to regain poise in the second quarter following a 50 percent decline in the first quarter.  Accordingly, the cryptocurrency got off to a great start in April only to print fresh 2018 lows in June.  April: BTC squashes 'Death Cross' FUD  The bearish sentiment hit the extreme in early April as pundits took note of the much-feared ""death cross"" (a bearish crossover between 50-day moving average and 200-day moving average) and began calling a move lower to $2,800 (a level was last seen in September 2017).  However, the lagging indicator trapped bears on the wrong side of the market as oversold conditions put BTC on a recovery mode. Further, the bullish move gathered traction on reports that Soros and Rockefeller are venturing into crypto waters.  Consequently, by April end, BPI was flashing 33 percent month-on-month gain and looked set to scale the $10,000 mark.  May: High hopes shattered  The cryptocurrency had breached the long-term falling trendline (drawn from Dec. 17 high and Jan. 6 high) in April. So, emboldened BTC bulls were anticipating a big break above $10,000, which never happened.  Further, things took a turn for worst in mid-May as BTC prices fell below the key 50-day MA and 100-day MA, signaling the path of least resistance is to the downside.  The cryptocurrency continued losing altitude and closed the month with a 19 percent loss.  June: Bitcoin hits fresh 2018 lows  BTC remained on the defensive throughout June as the long-term technical indicators turned bearish. The 5-month MA crossed the 10-month MA from above, confirming a bearish crossover for the first time in four years.  Further, BTC found acceptance below the 50-week moving average for the first in over two-and-a-half years and suffered a pennant breakdown (bearish continuation pattern). Consequently, prices fell below $6,000 in June for the first time since November and printed a fresh 2018 low of $5,827.  As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $6,560, according to the BPI. Technically speaking, the cryptocurrency looks set to test $5,000 in the current quarter, as suggested by the pennant breakdown.  Q3 Outlook  The above chart shows BTC has bounced off the key 75-week exponential moving average (EMA) (MA) support.  History shows, the moving average is a make or break level for BTC. For instance, BTC's last bear market ended with an upside break (marked by a square) of the 75-week EMA at the end of 2015 and what followed was a two-year long bull market.  So, while there is a reason to be optimistic, bulls are cautioned against being too ambitious as the long-term descending trendline is still intact. Only a break above that level would signal a bearish-to-bullish trend change.  That said, the probability of BTC crossing the trendline hurdle in Q3 is high, given the cryptocurrency has rebounded from the key 75-week MA.  Note that bears will likely make a strong comeback should BTC fall back below 75-week MA.

The report argues that the blockchain industry is setting up ""parallel financial networks"" that exist as alternatives to incumbent systems in operation today. And while these new platforms still operate ""on the fringes of the mainstream economy,"" Bernstein's authors say that ""with size and scale, we will witness mainstream talent and then eventually capital diverted towards"" these new networks.  Indeed, the report argues that what is being developed is a ""market-based innovation experiment"" – yet one that isn't without its issues, as seen by the prevalence of token sale scams, among other forms of crypto-specific fraud.  At the same time, Bernstein's analysts suggest that the market for crypto-assets – being a global one that never closes for business – serves as a ""natural correction system,"" comparing that state of affairs favorably to the 2000s dot-com bubble that played out on regulated exchanges with specific operating times.  The analysts wrote:  ""To see the fund-raising landscape as scam prone and with regulatory skepticism fails to recognize it as a market based innovation experiment to build out a new financial system. And the 24*7 trading market acts as a natural correction system for the bad actors unlike the dot com bubble where the feedback for weak business models came with a lag. Crypto markets build and destroy fortunes every day.""  The report also delved more deeply into specific cryptocurrencies, noting that bitcoin in particular ""needs no more critiques.""  It continued, saying ""to start with bitcoin is the first global, digital, non-state/non-central entity controlled, financial asset with 24 * 7 market-based prices. It also facilitates global money transfer & final settlement within less than an hour (at a cost between 0.5-1%) which no bank or international network offers.""  Bernstein also cited ethereum's ERC-20 token and its use in token sales as ""the killer application"" for the network.  ""While, fraught with regulatory uncertainties around retail sale of security and fraudulent projects, the fund-raising movement has funded many projects that are building the core infrastructure layer of the crypto fintech network,"" the authors wrote.

The trading range's lower end is $6,341, a double bottom neckline (former resistance-turned-support), which was scaled on June 30. Meanwhile, $6,754 (a 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from $9,990 to $5,755), which put brakes on BTC's rally earlier this week, marks the upper end of the trading range.  A convincing move above $6,754 would signal a resumption of the rally from $5,755 (June 24 low) and would open the doors to $7,000, as indicated by the double bottom breakout and bull flag breakout earlier this week.  On the other hand, the bullish case would weaken significantly if prices find acceptance below $6,341.  That said, the short duration charts indicate the odds are stacked in favor of a downside break of the trading range. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,520 on Bitfinex - down 1 percent on a 24-hour basis.  1-hour chart  The bears may feel emboldened by BTC's transition from rising channel (bullish setup) to falling channel (bearish setup), as seen in the chart above.  Further, Bollinger Bands (standard deviation of +2,-2 on 20-hour moving average) are trending south, indicating a bearish setup.  BTC is also trading below 50-hour and 100-hour moving average (MA), indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. More importantly, 50-hour MA risks falling below 100-hour MA in the next few hours (bearish crossover).  4-hour chart  The downside break of the rising channel yesterday added credence to the bearish relative strength index (RSI) divergence and strengthened the bear case.  The chart also shows Bollinger Bands that have adopted bearish bias (beginning to fall).  View  BTC risks falling below $6,341 (double bottom neckline - former resistance-turned-support, the lower end of the trading range) as indicated by the bearish setup on the hourly and 4-hour chart.  Acceptance below $6,341 would abort the bullish view put forward by the double bottom breakout, bull flag breakout and bullish falling channel breakout and would shift risk in favor of a drop below $6,000.  On the higher side, an aggressive move above the significant obstacle of $6,754 (23.6 percent Fibonacci resistance) would bolster the already bullish technical setup on the daily chart and open doors to $7,000.

42429351,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxc7h,1530864009,Ethereum's Growing Gas Crisis (And What's Being Done to Stop It),"Ethereum is in the midst of a ""gas crisis.""  At least, that's according to Taylor Monahan, CEO of MyCrypto, who took to Twitter this week to remind users of best practices for setting transaction fees when using the world's second-largest blockchain. The words of concern are warranted – because of changing conditions on the network, there's a possibility users of the startup's wallet software are overpaying for transactions.  In total, ethereum users spent 5,862 ether, or $2.7 million, to send transactions on Monday, an all-time high according to available network data. The culprit? A single exchange, China-based FCoin, appears to be congesting the blockchain with a controversial business model.  ""It's [good to remember] what gas actually is, how it works, and why it's necessary… and why this situation is unnecessary,"" Monahan tweeted.  A measure of computational effort, the price of gas (effectively what users pay to use the network) fluctuates according to demand. And that demand appears to be escalating to unprecedented levels. While December saw a popular digital cat breeding game CryptoKitties overwhelm the network, cumulative gas expenses at that time were less than half of this week's new heights.  ""Gas prices not looking good right now,"" warned Eth Gas Station, a primary resource for ether gas metrics, on Twitter Monday, stating that users should pay $3.20 for a transaction to be accepted, or wait for periods of 30 minutes for that transaction to be accepted into a block.  The situation has since corrected – transaction fees, while still high, have settled relative to Monday's peaks – but still, developers are exploring ways to ensure that volatility is improved.  ""The problem is what is causing these fees to go up and how that affects to the usability of the blockchain in a broader sense,"" Monahan told CoinDesk.  And what's because, while transaction costs point to a wider scaling issue (as the network reaches its limits, transaction fees increase) there's steps that can be taken to improve costs before ethereum moves into a more scalable architecture.  For example, Monahan said it's due to imperfect tooling, like gas pricing algorithms that occasionally go awry, and human error on behalf users accounts for much of the price rise.  Monahan summarized:  ""The fees are very high due to a few events over the past few days that have increased demand [and] a few parties who have external factors that make paying exorbitant transaction fees worthwhile.""  Gas attacks  One such actor, according to Monahan, is FCoin.  A China-based exchange, FCoin has previously drawn attention due to its novel revenue model, which involves distributing free tokens to users trading on the platform. As detailed by CoinDesk, the model has proved popular, having led the exchange to 24 trading highs of $5.6 billion last month, a figure that vastly exceeded the top exchanges on CoinMarketCap combined.  Behind the ethereum congestion however is that currently, FCoin is running a daily competition, whereby users vote for a token listing by depositing that token – repeatedly – onto the exchange.  As a result, it spurred token developers to send out airdrops to a multitude of accounts, sparking hundreds of thousands of transactions, a gesture that for many in the ethereum community was not well received.  ""$240,000 burned in gas so far,"" founder of Fresco, Roy Huang, tweeted on Monday, ""If you want this madness, you are in blockchain for wrong reason.""  Speaking to CoinDesk, Monahan echoed this sentiment, calling it an ""absolutely despicable voting mechanism,"" that was incentivizing Sybil attacks, a kind of spam attack that swarms a network with false identities.  Sparked in times of network congestion, the result is what ethereum researcher Philippe Castonguay calls a ""gas price war,"" in which users battle for network inclusion by bidding higher fees.  The impact of this is numerous: transactions fees increase, transactions fail due to inefficient fees, and others, out of frustration or accident, send enormously high transaction fees- which drives up the price for everyone else.  It even causes advanced users to collude with miners to skip the transaction fee, Monahan said.  Network fixes  But regardless of the actions of FCoin, developers are emphasizing that there's ways to improve the situation for all users, irrespective of whether that usage is condemned.  ""On the recent high gas fees I have to disagree with criticism regarding 'spam transactions,'"" Georgios Konstantopoulos from Loom Network tweeted, ""We're in a permissionless network. There are no spam transactions. If somebody pays the required fee, the [transaction] is not spam.""  As such, there's work being done that can improve the situation, in both the short and long term.  For example, Griff Green has authored a proposal based on research by Alexey Akhunov, in which ethereum adopts a technique inspired by bitcoin, named the ""child pays the parent"" strategy.  Rather than transactions by the same account being processed separately, miners can sort transactions according to account, and claim a higher bounty by processing them simultaneously, which could be useful for ""super users,"" like exchanges, that send multiple transactions at once.  ""Right now the miner is just leaving money on the table,"" Green told CoinDesk.  Founder of ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, has also authored a proposal, that simplifies the gas pricing algorithm, making it easier to predict what the correct gas price should be.  Down the line, such a simplified algorithm could eliminate the errors of the gas pricing market today. But while it has been broadly well received, it would require all users to upgrade the software.  ""It definitely attacks the heart of the problem, but I would be surprised to see this implemented before the end of 2018,"" Green told CoinDesk.  On the other hand, Green's proposal, that could have a ""strong impact on the network,"" according to Green, only requires the code to be implemented by miners, and wouldn't require a hard fork to improve efficiency.  Green told CoinDesk:  ""It effectively adds a feedback loop that can help everyone prioritize transactions effectively.""  Bigger picture  However, speaking to CoinDesk, Afri Schoedon, a communications manager at Parity, said that underlying the conversation is the bigger issue of scaling ethereum to keep up with user demand.  ""In general the gas price market is a good thing, in theory, but in reality clients are at the limit what they can process,"" Schoedon told CoinDesk.  Castonguay, who is responsible for a short term scaling-measure named GasToken Factory that allows users to profit from cleaning unnecessary data from the blockchain, agreed that scaling was the underlying concern.  ""The recent gas price surges are really only a reflection that the ethereum blockchain has been close to its maximum throughput for a while,"" Castonguay said, ""It reflects that people have been using the protocol consistently and that ethereum needs to scale.""  That said, scaling solutions, such as sharding, are far-reaching, experimental technologies, and the timeline for their completion is still unknown.  ""This is cutting-edge research,"" ethereum developer Nick Johnson, responding to a disgruntled user, wrote on Reddit, ""Nobody else has solved it either. Give it time.""  Yet both a scaling and an optimization problem, speaking to CoinDesk, Monahan emphasized that this widens the pool of those capable of assisting in network improvements.  ""We all have a role to play in building the future,"" Monahan said, concluding:  ""We should all try to take part in discussions, provide feedback on the tools we are using, and be active participants in this future.

42429355,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxcJh,1530860461,Tradeshift Pilots Stablecoin to Speed Up Business Payments,"Stablecoin startup MakerDAO announced Friday that it has launched a pilot program with supply chain management startup Tradeshift aimed at speeding up payments for small businesses.  In its announcement, MakerDAO – the company behind the stablecoin DAI – said its stablecoin is now being tested with the Tradeshift Cash solution in a bid to tokenize unpaid invoices of small businesses. The idea is that the coin could be sold at a discount to crypto investors so that small businesses can receive their payments upfront.  Launched in December 2017, MakerDAO's DAI token is one of a growing number of stablecoins. It was designed to adjust its supply as the market shifts in order to maintain a price pegged to the U.S. dollar.  According to Tradeshift's website, the Tradeshift Cash solution currently allows small businesses to sell their outstanding invoices as an asset type to traditional investors at a discount. Investors could then earn the margin when a payment is eventually released by a payer.  Rune Christensen, founder of MakerDAO, told CoinDesk in an interview that by introducing a stablecoin to Tradeshift's existing system, the pilot would bring this type of asset class to more cryptocurrency investors.  He explained that during the testing phase, a small business using Tradeshift will have an option to convert a pending invoice into a blockchain token at a discount that can be purchased using dai. The fund will then be exchanged into a fiat currency and subsequently credited to the small business' account.  As a stablecoin's price can remain relatively constant, the hope is that the pilot could allow more small businesses to have the option to sell their pending invoices to receive their payments more quickly.  ""The trade receivables market has very tight margins, which leaves no room for a volatile digital currency as [an] instrument for settlement, "" Tradeshift's co-founder Gert Sylvest said in the announcement.  In addition to that feature, MakerDAO said it is also planning to launch an open platform with Tradeshift where small businesses can directly interact with investors in order to further boost market liquidity.  ""It will be very cheap because there will be a lot of money available for the small businesses, and also there will be a lot of small businesses available for the investors to choose from,"" Christensen said.  The pilot comes just a month after Tradeshift announced plans to expand into blockchain following its $250 million Series E funding round, led by Goldman Sachs.

42429336,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxbnh,1530844245,India's Ruling Party Accused of Involvement in 'Mega Bitcoin Scam',"The Indian National Congress (INC) party, the largest political party in the nation, is accusing the ruling Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) of money laundering through bitcoin.  INC, more commonly known as the Congress Party, alleged Thursday that the BJP was converting ""black money"" using bitcoin in the Western state of Gujurat, the English-language daily newspaper Hindustan Times reported. Further, the party called for the Indian Supreme Court to launch a probe to monitor the investigation.  According to the report, INC spokesperson Shaktisinh Gohil alleged that BJP ""leadership was involved in converting black money through"" the bitcoin scam, which is allegedly worth between $727 million and $12.79 billion.  Gohil told the reporters:  ""We demand an impartial Supreme Court-monitored judicial investigation in this maze of 'Mega Bitcoin Scam' so that the truth comes out.""  He added that by using bitcoin, certain leaders at BJP were able to convert their ""black money"" to other businessmen in the state. However, the BJP denied the allegations, saying the Congress Party's ""dirty tricks department"" was simply trying to ""spread confusion and lies.""  Indeed, BJP spokesperson Anil Baluni seemed to imply that the INC may have an ulterior motive in accusing the ruling party of laundering the funds.  ""I wonder if the Congress is trying to help somebody in this case as part of a conspiracy,"" he said.

42429344,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxbth,1530840656,PoWx: The New Effort to Change Bitcoin Mining Explained,"A long-controversial bid to change bitcoin just got a big boost.  Boasting the support of tenured developers, a non-profit foundation called PoWx launched this week with the goal of putting a more sophisticated wrapper on the idea that proof-of-work (PoW), the way the network comes to agreement on which transactions are valid, could be replaced with a newer, supposedly better, algorithm.  In short, PoWx advocates bitcoin adopt a new technology it calls ""optical"" proof-of-work, which uses a more energy-efficient laser technology as the cornerstone of mining.  The hope is to ""fix"" mining by making it easier for more people to participate in the process, in part, because the barriers to entry have become so prohibitive. (At the beginning in 2009, users just needed a simple laptop to run the code to mine bitcoins. Now, they need to purchase specialized computers costing thousands of dollars and which they don't do anything else.)  Not to mention, the developers behind PoWx are the latest to point to one mining firm, Bitmain, and its influence on the network as a major issue. Though exact numbers are cloudy, estimates say the company is manufacturing between 50 and 80 percent of bitcoin's mining hardware.  Against this backdrop, the idea of swapping bitcoin's mining algorithm has been around for some time, mostly flaring up in times of perceived crisis. It's been seen almost as a last resort to be deployed only in the case miners do something really bad, such as colluding to attack the network.  But PoWx founder Michael Dubrovsky sees the change as an inevitability.  He calls mining centralization bitcoin's ""Seldon Crisis,"" a specific type of earth-shattering issue found in the famous sci-fi series ""Foundation"" and which denotes a point of no return.  Dubrovsky told CoinDesk:  ""I think PoW consensus is the most important innovation in bitcoin, and bitcoin is an incredibly important innovation in personal freedom and property rights.""  To this end, he argues changing this underlying technology will help to ""ensure the mining ecosystem is healthy enough and scalable enough to support crypto's growth over the next decade.""  A better way?  More broadly, developers have long worried about bitcoin's level of ""centralization,"" or the measure of how much control single stakeholders have over the technology. (Decentralization is seen as a key differentiator, one that makes bitcoin more unprecedented in the history of money.)  To that end, they've argued that if this problem goes unaddressed, mining centralization might lead bitcoin to turn into something resembling the financial system it's supposed to replace.  So, to attempt to put this problem to rest, developers have put forth a variety of potential technical fixes.  Dubrovsky grew interested in changing proof-of-work as a solution, deciding to work on the idea about a year ago as he became convinced optical PoW was the best solution.  According to the PoWx team, this new algorithm, if implemented, would usher in two huge improvements to bitcoin. One, the barrier to entry for startups producing the chips will be lower, thus increasing decentralization of the network. Two, it reduces power consumption (estimates suggest bitcoin now makes up 0.15 percent of the world's electricity costs).  One hurdle though is PoWx has yet to secure fundraising.  But their goals are nonetheless ambitious, vowing in the short-term to develop open-source hardware putting optical PoW into practice and to release a test network demonstrating their open-source design by Q1 of 2019.  Longer-term, they hope to launch a for-profit company called Arrakis Photonics to put this cutting-edge optical mining hardware into practice. (Their presentationhttps://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b3a78ced274cb0fa129ac81/t/5b3b169488251b554c4fc7ea/1530599066033/PoWx.org+Presentation.pdf outlines more specific details, including the technical makeup of the hardware they want to create.)  Popularity TBD  Although they're putting plenty of thought into this idea, swapping bitcoin's proof-of-work isn't at all an easy task.  It's a pretty drastic change, one that would require every user to update their software if it was coded into a formal proposal. If a larger number of users were to disagree on the proposal (if and when introduced), bitcoin could even split into two different cryptocurrencies, similar how bitcoin cash broke off due to disagreement about the project's technical direction.  Still, it's perhaps too early to say what users want - though the general idea has prompted outpourings of controversy, including lawsuit threats, in the past. And as bitcoin is a decentralized system, the opinion of users can make all the difference.  But Dubrovsky argues there's no choice - the community needs to make the change.  ""I think it will be difficult, but what we are proposing is not just an improvement,"" he told CoinDesk. ""Something like this is a necessity if cryptocurrency is going to be truly decentralized and used to securely store and move trillions of dollars of value.""  As such, one of PoWx's main goals is to work with the bitcoin community to make the switch.  So far, the effort has won the support of Bitcoin Core contributor Luke Dashjr and pseudonymous bitcoin.org maintainer Cobra, two influential figures in the space who are also both known for espousing controversial points of view. (Most bitcoin developers have yet to make a public statement about their views.)  Finally, there's always the question of whether mining will just centralize again, even after PoW is changed. However, Dubrovsky argues it's unlikely.  ""It is not clear that OPoW could ever lead to the same level of centralization we see today,"" he said.  Still, he's trying his best to look at the problem realistically, agreeing it's unclear how PoWx will work yet. And, even if it does, he admits bitcoin could still have future problems.  He concluded:  ""I hope PoWx can participate in solving that next crisis as well, but we will all cross that bridge when the time comes.""
