42398281,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT5Xl,1426714226,BitFury Names Former Justice Department Official to Advisory Board,"UPDATE (19th March 0:00 BST): This piece has been updated with additional comment and information from BitFury.      A former US Department of Justice official has been named to the board of strategic advisors at bitcoin mining firm BitFury.  As reported by the Wall Street Journal, former Deputy Assistant Attorney General Jason Weinstein will act as a regulatory and law enforcement liaison for BitFury. Currently a partner at Washington, DC-based law firm Steptoe & Johnson LLP, Weinstein will serve in a private capacity while continuing his work at the law firm.  Weinstein resigned from the Justice Department in 2012 during a Congressional investigation into Operation Fast and Furious, a failed gun-walking program that dates back to the Bush administration, and is believed by some to have contributed to an increase in Mexican gang violence and the murder of a US Border Patrol officer in 2010.  During an interview with the Journal, Weinstein spoke favorably of bitcoin’s open transaction ledger and its potential role in law enforcement, noting:  “The glass-half-empty view of the blockchain is that this is anonymous and we are never going to be able to track criminals, but the glass-half-full view is there is traceability and a real advantage in having every transaction in the history of the currency available.""  Weinstein went on to suggest that there is a need for greater oversight of the bitcoin industry in order to root out what he called ""bad actors"" in the system.  “It is in everyone’s interest for bad actors that use a new technology to be rooted out so that everyone else can enjoy the fruits of that technology,” he said.  BitFury CEO Valery Vavilov said that the addition of Weinstein to the company's strategic board gives it an edge in Washington, explaining that he believes Weinstein will be well-placed to speak on behalf of the company and the bitcoin industry as a whole. He added that BitFury is also weighing the creation of a new office in Washington sometime in the future.  “We are excited to add Jason Weinstein to our advisory board,” he said in a statement. “Mr. Weinstein’s extensive expertise in cybercrime is invaluable.""

42398270,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT5Ou,1426702823,World Bitcoin Association Files for Bankruptcy Amid Landlord Legal Fight,"The company that operates Bitcoin Center NYC has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after months of legal wrangling.  The World Bitcoin Association (WBA) has been embroiled in a legal dispute with its landlord over site issues at 40 Broad Street, which houses Bitcoin Center NYC.  The organization claimed between $100,000 and $500,000 in liabilities, and up to $50,000 in assets, according to court documents obtained by CoinDesk. The filing also states that the company expects to have enough funds to pay unsecured creditors, with a creditor meeting scheduled for 17th April.  The legal situation involving the company may see further developments in the days ahead, as according to Bitcoin Center NYC co-founder Nick Spanos, the company is planning to file to have the bankruptcy petition dismissed. Spanos said that the Bitcoin Center NYC remains open despite the problems.  In an interview, New York attorney Jacques Catafago said of the landlord’s behavior toward his client:  “In 30 years, I’ve never seen a landlord behave as poorly as this landlord.”  The WBA first filed suit against its landlord, 40 Broad Associates No 2 LLC, in October 2014, and is being represented by Catafago in those proceedings. For its separate bankruptcy case, the WBA is being represented by New York-based law firm Shafferman & Feldman LLP.  Thousands in damages  The WBA accused the landlord of failing to address water leakage problems which it alleges resulted in thousands of dollars in damages and operational complications. In its original lawsuit, the WBA sought $100,000 in damages as well as interest and court fees.  The landlord countersued in civil court later that month, seeking to evict the company from the premises. That court agreed, but an appellate court later put in place a stay of proceedings, requiring the WBA to pay a $150,000 bond.  Rather than paying the bond, Catafago told CoinDesk, the WBA filed for bankruptcy protection.  The issues with the landlord center on both operational and contractual concerns. Court documents submitted last fall allege that in addition to unaddressed leaks, the landlord put scaffolding in place that the plaintiffs claim adversely affected their ability to operate.  The filing notes:  ""Plaintiff has fully performed all of its obligations under the lease agreement, but without justification, defendent has violated and threatens to continue to violate plaintiff's contractual rights by: (a) failing to repair serious leak condition in the premises; (b) erecting scaffolding outside the demised premises which has adversely affected plaintiff's business; and (c) refusing to provide the 10-year extension as required and instead serving a 30-day Notice of Termination.""  Subsequent court filings allege that the landlord was actively aware of the site problems yet chose not to address them. An eviction notice included in court documents obtained by CoinDesk show that the landlord served an eviction notice dated August 2013, demanding that the tenant vacate the property by the end of September.  Organization evolution  The New York-based WBA was originally intended to serve as an advocacy group located at the 40 Broad Street location.  Declining to name specific partners, Spanos explained that a withdrawal in support resulted in the company having to work with far more limited resources. The Bitcoin Center NYC later grew out of those efforts, he told CoinDesk.  Coupled by the alleged conduct of the landlord, he said, the company was never able to act in its planned capacity and instead incurred unexpected costs that it is now seeking to recoup.  Court documents suggest that the landlord accused the WBA of operating as a shell company, allegations that Catafago called ""entirely unsubstantiated"" in a filing dated 5th March.  A tale of two WBAs  Following the news that the WBA was declaring bankruptcy, confusion emerged as to the exact nature of the company.  Some reports pointed to a WBA based in Zurich, founded around the same time as the New York-based WBA. That group’s website describes it as a non-profit dedicated to pooling efforts among global bitcoin-focused organizations. Its news and media page hasn’t been updated since shortly after the group’s announced creation in January 2014.  Spanos told CoinDesk that his company has no association with the Zurich-based group.  A representative for the Bitcoin Center NYC also denied the connection. The World Bitcoin Association of Zurich did not respond to queries by press time.  CoinDesk will continue monitoring this developing story and provide updates as they become available.  Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the World Bitcoin Association was intended to serve as a companion company to the Bitcoin Center NYC. The WBA is the official tenant of the 40 Broad Street, New York, location, and was originally intended to serve as a bitcoin advocacy group under that name. The Bitcoin Center NYC later grew out of those initial efforts. We apologize for this error.

42398261,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT5I1,1426698805,Apple Suspends Bitcoin Game SaruTobi from iOS Store,"SaruTobi creator Christian Moss has confirmed that the iOS game has been temporarily removed from Apple's App store.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Moss said that the tech giant had removed SaruTobi over concerns that users could mistake its in-game bitcoin with real bitcoin.  The game, which lets users swing a monkey from a vine in a bid to collect bitcoin tokens, tips users in real bitcoin and allows them to purchase animated coins with no real-world value for use in the app.  Moss said that the issue had now been fixed and that the app is currently awaiting Apple's review.  Apple and bitcoin  Moss explained that Apple had personally called him to notify him of the removal, a rarity that led him to believe it is paying increasing attention to bitcoin.  The news comes just two months after Apple first approved the retro-syle game, clarified its bitcoin policy and reinstated apps that had previously been banned.  Despite having seemingly shifting its policy, Apple removed messaging service Wiper from the China version of its iOS App store following the integration of bitcoin payments two days ago.  Wiper CEO Manlion Carelli confirmed at the time that the removal was a direct result of the bitcoin integration, which had taken place earlier this month.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC,Yessi Bello Perez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/03/18/apple-suspends-bitcoin-game-sarutobi-from-ios-store,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
42398266,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT5Lx,1426687338,UK's Plans to Regulate Bitcoin Revealed in Treasury Report,"The UK Treasury has announced a series of initiatives dealing with digital currency in a landmark report published in conjunction with the Chancellor of the Exchequer's annual budget speech today.  The announcement is the government's first major attempt to grapple with the regulatory and consumer safety issues surrounding digital currencies.  The report is largely positive towards digital currencies, noting its potential as a payments technology, while also underlining its nascent state and the potential risks associated with its use.  The report said:  ""The government considers that digital currencies represent an interesting development in payments technology ... the potential advantages are clearest for purposes such as micro-payments and cross-border transactions.""  The most significant announcement is the government's plan to apply anti-money laundering (AML) regulations to digital currency exchanges.  AML Legislation Plans  HM Treasury will lead an effort to seek the views of digital currency companies and the general public in a ""full consultation"" on the issue early in the next Parliament, according to the report. The UK is due for a general election on 7th May and the new parliamentary year will begin soon after that.  The government will ask for feedback on crucial questions like who should fall under mandatory regulation and which institution should play the role of regulator.  The planned consultation will also cover law enforcement, to ensure that tools and legislation are in place to identify and prosecute criminal users of digital currencies and that illicit funds can be seized.  Applying AML rules to exchanges is necessary to ""support innovation"" and prevent the illicit use of digital currencies, the report said.  The Treasury report is the result of a call for information on digital currencies issued last November. That attracted more than 120 responses from digital currency companies, banks, payments firms, academics and other government departments and agencies, the report said.  One of the government's goals with its package of policy measures is to create an environment for digital currency entrepreneurs to ""flourish"", including gaining access to banking and other professional services, which UK bitcoin businesses have so far struggled to obtain.  Banks have claimed that the lack of regulation is the key reason for denying services to digital currency businesses, the report said. It noted that other submissions said banks hadn't worked to correctly assess the risk posed by digital currency companies.  Three banks, including HSBC, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Citi, are listed among the groups that made submissions to HM Treasury.  Regulatory sandbox and research funds  The digital current report dovetails with another announcement made today that HM Treasury will work with the financial services regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, and the Prudential Regulatory Authority to look into developing a ""regulatory sandbox"" for financial technology companies. Entrepreneurs could then test ideas in a lightly regulated environment, and with the ""informed consent"" of customers.  Another major initiative announced in the report is £10m earmarked for research into digital currency technology.  The research initiative will involve Research Councils, which are publicly funded research agencies; the Alan Turing Institute, a new government-funded organisation that will look into ""big data"", and Digital Catapult, a non-profit that works on data-sharing projects to aid small businesses.  The development of a ""pioneering"" framework of voluntary standards for consumer protection is another component of HM Treasury report. The government will work with the British Standards Institution and the digital currency private-sector to create a series of ""best practice"" standards for consumer protection. The BSI is the UK's National Standards Body.  The voluntary framework will address the risks of digital currency use, identified in the report as the storage security, fraudulent or insolvent exchanges and price volatility. The framework will also help industry avoid a ""disproportionate"" regulatory burden, the report said.  The full report can be read here.

42398264,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT5J0,1426685252,Dark Market Evolution Vanishes With $12 Million in Bitcoin,"Notorious dark web marketplace Evolution has vanished amid reports that its administrators have absconded with more than $12m in bitcoin.  Accessible only via the Tor network, the market had become the go-to online drug bazaar following the shut down of Silk Road and Operation Onymous, a pan-agency crackdown on illicit markets that seized over 400 domains in November.  Members of the darkweb community expressed concerns about Evolution's moderators – operating under the handles 'Kimble' and 'Verto' – who were delayed responding to and processing withdrawal requests.  Reddit's Evolution discussion page was also awash with claims that the site's administrators had blamed the delays on a backlog of withdrawals, reassuring worried vendors that the issue would be resolved within 24 hours.  However, the Evolution marketplace and its user discussion forum went offline shortly after, indicating the possibility that the administrators had taken the money and dissapeared.  Reddit user NSWGreat, who previously claimed to handle the site's public relations, said: ""Evolution can officially be put on the Wall of Shame. Verto and Kimble have [expletive] us all.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET,Yessi Bello Perez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/03/18/dark-market-evolution-vanishes-with-12-million-in-bitcoin,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
42398274,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT5Sq,1426682808,Ripple Labs Appoints Former US State Department Official as Advisor,"San Francisco-based Ripple Labs, the startup behind the digital payment network Ripple, has appointed a former US State Department official as an advisor.  Speaking about her new role, Anja Manuel said she was excited to build on Ripple's ""impressive momentum"" and looking forward to help it gain international traction.  ""Ripple is uniquely designed to lower both the costs and risks inherent to domestic and cross-border payment systems,"" she added.  The former US State Department official said: ""It has the potential to expand the global economy through increased trade, and enables better, more transparent regulatory oversight of payments.""  Prior to her appointment at Ripple Labs, Manuel is credited with being part of the negotiating team for the US-India civilian nuclear accord as well as developing US policy toward Afghanistan and Pakistan.  She also works alongside former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, former National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley, and former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates in her role as co-founder and partner of RiceHadleyGates LLC, a consulting firm.    Chris Larsen, Ripple Labs CEO and co-founder, said:    ""I am excited to welcome Anja to the Ripple Labs team. Her advice will be key as we grow our international presence and Ripple's adoption by financial institutions and payment networks across the world.""  Recent additions  The announcement follows the appointment of Susan Athey, a professor of economics at Stanford Graduate School of Business and senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economics Policy Research to Ripple's board of directors last year.  Gene Sperling, a former economic advisor to both former President Bill Clinton and current President Barack Obama also joined the decentralised payment network provider's board of directors in January.  Busy period  The various notable appointments come after a seemingly busy period for Ripple Labs.  The California-based startup announced that CBW Bank and Cross River Bank had adopted its distributed open-source payment protocol in September last year, making them the first US institutions of their kind to do so.  More recently, Ripple Labs confirmed it had joined the International Payments Framework Association (IFPA).  The association provides rules, best practices and guidance on how to improve cross-border payments and includes the likes of Automated Clearing House (ACH) and SWIFT among its members.
