42408198,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaBTTw,1715815495,"Canada’s ‘Crypto King’ and Associate Arrested, Charged With Fraud in Alleged $30M Ponzi Scheme","Two Canadian men have been arrested and charged with fraud for allegedly swindling investors out of $40 million CAD – approximately $30 million USD –i n a crypto and foreign exchange investment scheme.  Self-proclaimed “Crypto King” Aiden Pleterski, 25, was charged with fraud and money laundering for his role in the alleged Ponzi scheme. His associate, 27-year-old Colin Murphy, was charged with fraud, the Ontario Securities Commission announced Wednesday.  The criminal charges, which are the result of a 16-month investigation Canadian authorities are calling Project Swan, come amid an ongoing bankruptcy case tied to the alleged scheme that has been the subject of much media attention in Canada.  According to court documents and local media reports, between 2021 and 2022, approximately 160 investors gave Pleterski and his company, AP Private Equity Limited, around $40 million in Canadian dollars ($30 million USD) to invest on their behalf in the crypto and foreign exchange markets. Some of those investors, according to reports, took out loans to invest with Pleterski.  The trustee overseeing the bankruptcy case concluded that Pleterski only invested 2% of the money he was given, and spent at least $16 million on himself – buying over 10 luxury cars, traveling internationally, and renting a $8.4 million lakefront mansion for $45,000 per month. Two McLarens, two BMWs and a Lamborghini were seized during the bankruptcy process.  Pleterski, who is also a small-time livestreamer, posted videos of his escapades – including numerous vacations to places like Los Angeles, London and Miami, driving rented Lamborghinis and McLarens, and detailing his expenditures. In one video, in which Pleterski filmed himself assembling a Lego model of the Titanic, he estimated that he’d spent $150,000 on Legos since 2021.  During the bankruptcy process, Pleterski referred to himself as a “20-something-year-old kid” and told creditors that he was unorganized and didn’t keep records of his finances or payments, according to a report from CBC.  Alleged kidnapping  In December 2022, Pleterski was allegedly kidnapped, beaten and tortured by five victims of his alleged Ponzi scheme. According to reports, Pleterski’s alleged abductors held him for three days and subjected him to torture before demanding his landlord-turned-mentor pay a $3 million ransom for his release.  Pleterski was eventually released, but a 12-minute video of him, appearing swollen and bruised while apologizing to investors – which his lawyer later said was coerced – was posted to social media.  Four of the alleged perpetrators have been arrested and charged with kidnapping.  Toronto-born NBA player Shai Gilgeous-Alexander purchased the $8.4 million lakefront mansion Pleterski once called home, but filed suit against the seller to back out of the purchase after he learned of its connection to Pleterski. According to reports, Gilgeous-Alexander and his girlfriend received a “threatening visit” from a man looking for Pleterski and subsequently learned that there had been threats to burn down the home.  Next steps for Pleterski  Pleterski was released on $100,000 bail on Tuesday, signed for by his parents, according to a Wednesday report from CBC. Pleterski’s bail conditions require that he surrender his passport, refrain from posting anything on social media about financial matters, and not buy or trade crypto, the report added.

27874583,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608134,1715814023,How High Can The XRP Price Go? Crypto Analyst Unveils 6-Month Prediction,"Crypto analysts continue to be super bullish on the future of the XRP price despite its poor performance in the past. However, while some analysts have predicted price targets that, to many, seem unrealistic, others have set more conservative targets. This is the case of crypto analyst Alan Santana, who just unveiled his 6-month prediction for the XRP price. XRP Price Is Ready For A Bullish Wave Alan Santana took to the TradingView website to share his latest analysis on the XRP price. This prediction is expected to play out over the next six months as the crypto market heads into what is expected to be an explosive bull rally. Related Reading: This Crypto Expert Called The Bitcoin Top in 2021, Now He’s Calling The Bottom In 2024 The crypto analyst believes that in this cycle, the altcoin may find its price moving well ahead of other altcoins. “it is likely to be one of the first to move… One of the first to move big!” the analyst said. Santana also gives reasons for this, one of them being that the waiting period between each bullish wave for the XRP price has elapsed. His analysis showed that the altcoin has usually seen a 6-8-month gap between each bullish wave. However, it had been 308 days since it saw its last bullish wave, which is well over 10 months. This means that the altcoin is more than ready for another bullish wave. He also added, “The fact that XRPUSDT went through a correction and has been consolidating for this long is considered bullish.” Furthermore, the altcoin has been on a bullish trend, recording higher lows. This is usually bullish for any asset as it suggests better support for the price as it moves upward. “Higher lows means that the bulls have the upper hand when it comes to the long-term trajectory of this chart,” Santana explained. XRP Can Move 280% In 2024-2025 The crypto analyst expects a rather rapid bullish wave for the XRP price and stated that he expects this to happen sometime in 2024 and 2025. The main reason behind this is that the accumulation phase for the altcoin is finally coming to an end. This is a sentiment that has also been shared by another crypto analyst known as U-Copy. According to the analyst, the XRP price had been in accumulation for the last seven years, but it has finally come to an end in 2024, and this end in the accumulation phase will lead to a rally. Related Reading: Brace For Impact: Mt. Gox Set To Inject 142,000 BTC And 143,000 Bitcoin Cash Into The Market- Here’s When While U-Copy expects the altcoin to hit a new all-time high price as this accumulation phase comes to an end, which would be an at least 600% move from here, Santana has taken a more conservative stance. The analyst does expect the XRP price to break above $1, but puts the peak around $1.9 and $2. This would mean a 280-300% move from here. “Once it starts going, it will go really strong and for a very long while… People will be wondering, ‘why didn’t I buy when prices were low?’,” the analyst concluded.

However, crypto analyst BitQuant was not one of those people. In 2023, the analyst had correctly predicted that the BTC price would reach a new all-time high before the halving was completed. After the successful completion of his prediction, the crypto analyst has once again predicted where the Bitcoin price is headed, and how high it will go. Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Will Reach $95,000 BitQuant has unveiled his latest prediction for the Bitcoin price, and the target being displayed will please many who continue to be bullish. Amid the choppy headwinds that have dominated the market, the analyst believes that the Bitcoin price will surge and reach $95,000. Related Reading: Dogecoin Derivatives Volume Jumps 111% As Open Interest Spikes, But What About Price? Interestingly, the analyst does not expect the campaign to $95,000 to be a long, drawn-out move. Rather, BitQuant explains that the Bitcoin price can complete this target in a single move. Such a move would mean a 50% increase in price from its current level of around $62,000 and will no doubt trigger a ripple effect that will be evident in the market. The post read: $95K will be achieved in just one move, and that is quite obvious. Will that move start today, tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow? I don’t think anyone knows. If you can’t relax now and wait for #Bitcoin to perform as expected, then it’s better to leave the market to avoid the torture. Because in the coming months, there will be a lot of pain for those with weak nerves. BitQuant’s prediction was in response to another crypto analyst, Mikybull, who identified the formation of a ‘cup and handle’ pattern on the Bitcoin crash. The analyst believes that this formation will precede a massive breakout that will send it to a “cycle top.” Is $250,000 Still In Play? Back in 2023, when BitQuant made the initial prediction that Bitcoin would reach a new all-time high before the halving, he had set out a price target for the cryptocurrency. As the crypto analyst explained at the time, reaching a new all-time high before the halving, although it has never happened before, does not mean that it will peak by then. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Volume Flips Dogecoin, Will SHIB Price Flip DOGE If This Analyst’s Prediction Comes True? Rather, the analyst expects the bull rally to continue well after the halving, which is when the price will peak. BitQuant’s target at the time was the price peaking at $250,000 at the top of the cycle. However, this target has not made an appearance in his analyses in recent times. The most recent predictions circle around the $95,000 target and the analyst expects it to hit this price in May. In a prediction from April, BitQuant expects that the price will first go to $49,000, before recovering to $75,000, and then surge to $95,000. First $49K, Then $75K, Now $95K. What’s next will be revealed after we hit $95K and take a little break in the tent. #Bitcoin https://t.co/yvKyHZZWQw — BitQuant (@BitQua) April 25, 2024 Follow Best Owie on X (formerly Twitter) for market insights, updates, and the occasional funny tweet… chart from TradingView.com",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE | SHIB,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/market-expert-bitcoin-new-target/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/27871904.jpeg

This development comes as the company faces increased tensions with US regulators, which could potentially lead to legal repercussions. However, the move has propelled Solana’s (SOL) price to surpass the crucial $150 level, indicating a return of bullish momentum in the market. Solana Staking And Crypto Rewards According to the announcement, Robinhood unveiled new features for its European customers. These offerings include staking, localized applications, and crypto rewards. As part of its expansion, Robinhood has launched its first crypto-staking product exclusively for European customers. Through the platform, users can stake their Solana holdings and earn rewards with the ability to unstake their assets at any time. Additionally, new customers can receive a 10% bonus on their net purchases during their first 30 days on the platform, with the bonus paid out in Circle’s USDC stablecoin. This initiative aims to attract new users and improve their crypto investing experience. Related Reading: Bitcoin Analyst Reveals Why $57,938 Is The Level To Watch This Week While Robinhood Crypto expands its offerings in Europe, the company faces regulatory challenges in the United States. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued a Wells Notice to the exchange, indicating the staff’s recommendation for an enforcement action against the platform. Robinhood expressed disappointment in the SEC’s decision, emphasizing their efforts to seek regulatory clarity and asserting their belief that the listed assets on their platform are not securities. Vlad Tenev, the CEO of Robinhood, revealed that the company has held over 16 meetings with the SEC. However, these interactions have been largely unsatisfactory, according to Tenev. He expressed the company’s willingness to engage with the SEC in good faith but noted the regulatory body’s lack of reciprocal efforts. SOL Bulls Eye $200 As Trading Volume Rises Solana’s native token, SOL, experienced a significant rebound in the past hour, surging from the $140 zone to its current trading price of $153. This price movement holds key significance for bullish investors as they aim to retest the $200 mark previously surpassed in March. CoinGecko data further reveals a notable increase in SOL’s trading volume, reaching $2.7 billion in the last 24 hours, representing a 6.6% rise compared to the previous Monday’s trading session. Related Reading: Floki Inu Moment Of Glory: Analysts Forecast Explosive 200% Rally According to crypto analyst Jesse Olson, Solana has shown strength in its recent price action. Olson notes that Solana successfully hit all four downside targets and exhibited bullish divergence, followed by hitting three upside targets. The price appears to form a higher low, increasing the probability of reaching “target four,” projected at the $175 mark. Despite the bullish momentum, SOL faces crucial resistance walls at $157 and $172, which are expected to be significant obstacles toward higher price levels. On the other hand, the $140 line has served as a key support level for Solana’s price over the past week. SOL’s bullish momentum remains uncertain as it strives to overcome these resistance levels and retest its yearly high of $209.

Q1 earnings show record growth in revenues and net income and I expect this to continue. Technical analysis suggests bullish outlook for Coinbase, but competition and market cyclicality pose risks. Thesis Summary Coinbase ( COIN ) is making headlines today as the crypto exchange recently suffered a global outage , which seems to be resolved for the time. Despite what you might think, this outage is incredibly bullish, as it reflects a sudden surge in demand. Coinbase witnessed numerous outages during the last bull cycle too. Coinbase has reported a blowout quarter thanks to increased transaction revenues, but the stock is down from its peak. In fact, from a technical perspective, we have formed a nice base that now projects us much higher. In my last article , I issued a strong buy on COIN, as I argued that institutional money would begin to flow into Bitcoin. Indeed, we have seen Bitcoin's (BTC-USD) price move higher since, and Coinbase has been a major beneficiary, as we will see in this article. I maintain my strong buy rating for COIN, and believe the stock could close to double from here. Q1 Earnings Coinbase had a blowout quarter, beating both revenue and earnings estimates. Income statement (10Q) As we can see from the income statement in the 10Q, Coinbase more than doubled its revenues YoY. At the same time, thanks to gains from crypto assets, the company's total operating expenses actually decreased, leading to over $1 billion in net income, compared to a loss of $78 million in Q1 of 2023. Transaction revenue and subscription revenue (Seeking Alpha) Coinbase is firing on all cylinders. Transaction revenues hit an all-time high in Q1, and this is also true of subscription and service revenues. And, as you might expect, the total trading volume also made a new high. It is undeniable that Coinbase is thriving in this crypto bull market, and Bitcoin isn't even trading at its highest level at the moment. But should the recent outage concern COIN users and/or investors? Outages are bullish From the latest available news , it seems like the outage has been fixed, though some users say withdrawals are still not available. The reason for the outage hasn't been explained yet by Coinbase. Of course, this is not the first outage the company has suffered. Most recently, the company suffered an outage on February 28th . BTC chart (TradingView) I have marked in this Bitcoin chart above the day of the February 28th outage and also the current outage, As we can see, the February outage happened in the midst of a pretty strong rally, which eventually took Bitcoin to $70,000. BTC chart (TradingView) Coinbase also suffered a major outage on May 9th, 2020 , for example, and another one on January 7th, 2021. In both these cases, we actually saw a sell-off on the day, but both actually preceded much larger moves up. While there may be various reasons for an outage, it is pretty common for these things to happen during sudden price movements and surges in activity. In today's case, we have seen a breakout of the Bitcoin bull flag we have formed over the last three months. Bitcoin chart TA (Author's work) My guess is that a lot of people were looking at this as a key level to trade, and this surge in activity could have led to the outage. In any case, it's pretty clear that people are watching Bitcoin, activity in the network is increasing, and the price structure looks quite bullish. Ultimately, this all bodes very well for Coinbase. Technical Analysis Coinbase has a really nice chart in my opinion: COIN TA (Author's work) We have formed a very clean structure since we bottomed back in January. From an Elliott Wave perspective, I see a very clean five-wave structure developing. With the latest move, it is possible that we have bottomed in wave 4. We have formed a bullish divergence in the RSI, and the MACD is looking ready to flip. Obviously, I would be more comfortable adding this closer to the trendline support and the 200-day MA, but I feel like that would be too easy. Investors and traders are getting ready to buy now, especially as Bitcoin seems ready to break out. Risks As the crypto market heats up, more competitors are going to jump into the scene. For example, Coinbase now has to compete with ETFs, which offer another way to gain exposure to Bitcoin. Furthermore, companies like Robinhood ( HOOD ) are also coming into the industry . However, Coinbase is doing well to leverage other sources of revenue this time around, like subscriptions, and it may also be able to profit from institutional adoption. Final Thoughts There is no denying that Coinbase is reaping the benefits of this bull market. Both the fundamentals and technicals are lining up very nicely. I expect revenues to increase further in the next quarter as Bitcoin keeps moving up in price.

42408192,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaBTGi,1715804846,What the DOJ’s First MEV Lawsuit Means for Ethereum,"The U.S. Department of Justice charged two brothers with orchestrating an attack on Ethereum trading bots, charging them with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. In essence, the brothers found a way to target bots that were frontrunning transactions in a process called maximal extractable value, or MEV, which refers to the amount of money that can be bled out of the block production process by ordering transactions.  Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates. This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  MEV, which itself is controversial, can be a highly lucrative game dominated by automated bots that often comes at blockchain users’ expense, which is partially why so many in the crypto community have rushed to denounce the DOJ’s complaint. However, this is hardly a Robinhood situation, where two brothers, Anton and James Peraire-Bueno, of Bedford, Massachusetts, were stealing from the rich to give to the poor.  As indicated by the DOJ’s filing, the brothers brought in approximately $25 million in at least eight separate transactions in what, according to the DOJ, was a highly orchestrated and premeditated plot. They set up shell companies and searched for ways to safely launder funds to avoid detection. The highly technical complaint spells out the process by which the exploit occurred, which the DOJ calls “the very first of its kind.”  “They used a flaw in MEV boost to push invalid signatures to preview bundles. That gives an unfair advantage via an exploit,” former employee of the Ethereum Foundation and Flashbots Hudson Jameson told CoinDesk in an interview. Jameson added that the Peraire-Bueno brothers were also running their own validator while extracting MEV, which violates something of a gentleman’s agreement in MEV circles.  “No one else in the MEV ecosystem was doing both of those things at once that we know of,” he added. “They did more than just play by both the codified and pinky promise rules of MEV extraction.”  “It's not some kind of robin hood story as they didn't return the money to people MEVers extracted it from,” pseudonymous researcher Banteg said.  At a more technical level, the brothers were able to exploit an open-source built by MEV firm Flashbots called mev-boost that gave them an unequal view into how MEV bots were ordering transactions. (Mev-boost is an open-source protocol that allows different actors to compete to “build” the most valuable blocks by ordering transactions.)  “Having access to the block body allowed the malicious proposer to extract transactions from the stolen block and use them in their own block where it could exploit those transactions. In particular, the malicious proposer constructed their own block that broke the sandwich bots’ sandwiches up and effectively stole their money,” according to a Flashbots’ post-mortem in 2023.  In particular, and central to the DOJ’s case, is that the brothers found a way to sign false transactions in order to run the scheme. “This False Signature was designed to, and did, trick the Relay to prematurely release the content of the proposed block to the defendants, including private transaction information,” the document reads.  “The invalid header part is going to be the needle that this all balances on I think,” a crypto researcher, who asked to remain anonymous, said.  “I feel the indictment indicates that and therefore it may actually be a good thing that SDNY is verryyyy tech savvy in this and clearly layed out where they fucked up and alluded to the inevitability of MEV in blockchains,” Jameson said.  Others have also noted the technical sophistication of the DOJ’s argument, which seems to be less of an indictment of MEV or Ethereum itself than of an attempt to profit by unfairly gaining information.  “If you hope Ethereum will always be a ‘dark forest’ where on-chain predators compete with each other for arbitrage opportunities, then you probably dislike this prosecution,” Consensys General Counsel Bill Hughes told CoinDesk in an interview. “Thankfully, I think there are only a few who are actually like that. If you prefer predatory behavior like this be curtailed, which is the vast majority, then you are likely to feel the opposite.”  See also: Ethereum Has Gatekeepers (for Good Reason) | Opinion  “All of the defendants' preparation for the attack and their completely ham-fisted attempts to cover their tracks afterwards, including extensive incriminating google searches, just helps the government prove they intended to steal. All that evidence will look very bad to a jury. I suspect they plead guilty at some point,” he added.  Still, others remain convinced that exploiting MEV bots designed to reorder transactions is fair game. “It's a little hard to sympathize with MEV bots and block builders getting f*cked over by block proposers, in the exact same way they are f*cking over end users,” the anonymous researcher said.  Jameson, for his part, said the MEV is something the Ethereum community should work to minimize on Ethereum, but that it’s a difficult problem to solve. For now, the process is “inevitable.”  “Until it can be eliminated, let's study it. Let's illuminate it. Let's minimize it. And since it does exist, let's make it as open as possible for anyone to participate with the same rules,” he said.  If there is any silver lining, the Flashbots team were able to patch the error that enabled the attack fairly quickly, Cornell Tech professor Ari Juels said.  “There are no lasting implications,” he added. “There is of course an irony in what took place: A thief stealing money from sandwich bots, which themselves exploit users in the view of many in the community.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/15/what-the-dojs-first-mev-lawsuit-means-for-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8524e860085e53902a998b3545d3aa7e9f9192c9-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin could target the $84,000 level with altcoins performing well, Swissblock said.  Crypto markets rallied on Wednesday as softer-than-expected U.S. inflation data jolted digital assets from their stupor.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} surged past $66,000 for the first time since April 24, and was recently up more than 7% over the past 24 hours. Ether {{ETH}} changed hands near $3,000 but underperformed with a 4% advance during the same period.  Solana {{SOL}} and near {{NEAR}} led gains among crypto majors with 8% and 12% jumps, respectively, and the broader market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) was up 6%.  The rally occurred as April U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures edged lower from March, coupled with a slightly sluggish retail sales report. The data came as a relief for investors fearing that reaccelerating inflation and a red-hot economy might force the Federal Reserve to walk back its dovish pivot and even consider interest rate hikes.  ""Investors consider this as a bullish regime shift, as it marks the first decrease in CPI inflation over the last three months,"" Bitfinex analysts said in a market update. This, together with the Federal Reserve previously announcing its intention to taper the central bank's balance sheet run-off, ""is seen as a favorable print for risk assets,"" Bitfinex added.  Looking at traditional markets, U.S. equities also climbed during the day, with the S&P 500 index gaining more than 1% and hitting a fresh all-time high, underscoring the return of risk appetite.  Today's bitcoin surge also marked a break-out from a downtrend that capped prices for the last few weeks, Swissblock analysts said in a Telegram update.

42408191,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaBTDP,1715803565,U.S. House's McHenry Says Senate May Be Swayed if Many Democrats Back Crypto Bill,"The result of next week's expected vote on U.S. legislation to regulate the cryptocurrency industry will strongly influence the odds the U.S. Senate gets on board, said Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and a leading advocate for crypto legislation in the waning months of his career in Congress.  The thing to watch, he suggested, is if a lot of Democrats show up to support the bill. McHenry, who is set to retire at the end of the year, has made digital assets legislation a top priority for the end of his time on Capitol Hill. To that end, the House has recorded a number of recent cryptocurrency successes, from the passage of several relevant bills through McHenry's committee to the advancement of a congressional effort to overturn Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) crypto accounting policies. But chief among the House's digital assets endeavors is the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, or FIT21, which is heading toward a long-awaited vote for final approval in the House of Representatives in the coming days. That's the most comprehensive U.S. crypto bill to move this far through Congress and, if it's approved in a bipartisan vote in the House, will represent a high-water mark for the industry's efforts in Washington.  ""We will have this bill on the House floor next week for a vote,"" McHenry said at the DC Blockchain Summit on Wednesday. ""The outcome of that vote will dictate what kind of attention it'll get in the Senate and whether or not we can get something done.""  Read More: U.S. House's McHenry Says Bill on Crypto Market Structure Will Get Floor Vote  However, the bill isn't expected to find a ready match in the Senate, so far, meaning it wouldn't immediately be on a path to become law. However, McHenry suggested ""who knows what's going to happen"" in the so-called lame-duck session of Congress between the November election and the end of the session, when legislation has a way of hitching a ride on unrelated bills.  Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.), who heads a crypto subcommittee and is among the candidates who could replace McHenry in his chairman seat, said at the same event on Wednesday that he's optimistic about the outcome of the House vote on FIT21. One of the big reasons: 21 Democrats chose to vote in favor of overturning the SEC's controversial crypto accounting provision – Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121, or SAB 121 – despite President Joe Biden's threat to veto the effort. ""I'm optimistic, and I expect strong Democratic support,"" Hill said of the FIT21. ""This one is about the future."" Hill said it also answers President Biden's executive order from earlier in his term that called for legislation in this space.  McHenry agreed that getting so many Democrats to buck the White House and SEC on the accounting rule was ""a significant thing."" At least one Senate Democrat – New York's Kirsten Gillibrand – has said she'll support the resolution to overturn the bulletin when it comes up for a vote on Thursday.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/05/15/us-houses-mchenry-says-senate-may-be-swayed-if-many-democrats-back-crypto-bill,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f9dbff4c89a301df858d02715995e0f10889c14c-3852x2167.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This accumulation further strengthens the belief that this group of Bitcoin investors anticipate a potential upside for Bitcoin despite its recent volatility. Long-Term Holders Pay $4.3 Billion For 70,000 BTC According to Glassnode, long-term Bitcoin holders who had previously sold 1 billion BTC in the latter part of 2023 are accumulating once again. This buying activity could be interpreted as a potential bullish signal for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Volume Flips Dogecoin, Will SHIB Price Flip DOGE If This Analyst’s Prediction Comes True? Traditionally, Bitcoin long-term holders sell their holdings during peak prices and buy new tokens during periods of correction or substantial declines. When these seasoned investors buy cryptocurrencies during market lows, it usually indicates their expectations of a potential rebound, leading to profits. On the other hand, short-term holders are known to buy cryptocurrencies during sporadic price surges, often signaling that a cryptocurrency is nearing its peak. With Bitcoin presently stabilizing above $61,000, long-term Bitcoin holders probably see the cryptocurrency’s value as a prime buying opportunity. They have recently added a staggering 70,000 BTC valued at over $4.3 billion to their holdings. This sentiment for Bitcoin’s potential rally is also shared by a few crypto analysts who have predicted that the cryptocurrency would surge to new all-time highs during the approaching bull market. Earlier in March, before Bitcoin’s halving event, the cryptocurrency skyrocketed above $73,000, marking a new historic all-time high. With the bull market still on the way, Bitcoin could see further upsides as market conditions improve and investor demand rises. This could potentially lead to profits for long term holders who had purchased the cryptocurrency earlier. Moreover, the upcoming United States inflation report, set for release on May 15, could also be another primary factor driving long-term investors’ substantial BTC accumulation. With the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) remaining historically high, and the Federal Reserve (FED) unchanged rates, Bitcoin is seen as a possible hedge against inflationary pressures, protecting investors’ wealth against decline. Bitcoin Whales Display Opposite Trend Reports from blockchain analytics platform Santiment reveal that Bitcoin whales are showing an opposite trend from long-term holders. The analytics platform noted that Bitcoin whales appear to be taking a break from accumulating BTC, as the number of large-scale transactions has been decreasing significantly. Related Reading: Dogecoin Derivatives Volume Jumps 111% As Open Interest Spikes, But What About Price? This trend coincides with the cryptocurrency’s reduced on-chain activities and its declining value over the past few weeks. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has also shared a similar report, emphasizing that Bitcoin’s accumulation trend score is currently displaying a value closer to zero, indicating that larger investors were distributing their holdings rather than buying. Despite the downtrend, Martinez has disclosed that Bitcoin’s current TD sequential is signaling a buying opportunity and the cryptocurrency was poised for a rebound soon. At the time of writing, the cryptocurrency’s price is trading below $62,000, receiving a decrease of about 6.38% in the last month, according to CoinMarketCap.

42408190,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaBT3U,1715801931,Sweeping ‘Bitcoin Rights’ Bill Becomes Law in Oklahoma,"The bill will protect Oklahomans’ right to self-custody digital assets.  It also makes it legal for Oklahoma residents to mine crypto, both at home and on an industrial scale.  Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt signed a sweeping ‘Bitcoin Rights’ bill into law on Monday, enshrining Oklahomans’ legal right to mine, transact with, and self-custody cryptocurrencies and boosting the state’s reputation for being a friendly destination for crypto companies and investors.  The bill, HB3594, was introduced by Republican state Rep. Brian Hill and carried in the Senate by Republican state Sen. Bill Coleman. It was inspired by model policy from state-focused bitcoin mining advocacy group Satoshi Action Fund, which has helped introduce similar legislation in 15 other states.  Stitt’s signature on the bill is a bright spot for crypto advocates in an otherwise bleak regulatory landscape. In the absence of a regulatory framework for crypto from Congress, federal regulators have been left to their own devices to regulate the crypto industry, doing so largely through enforcement actions against crypto companies and developers.  The recent crackdown on crypto mixing services and other privacy tools, including criminal charges for Samourai Wallet and Tornado Cash developers, has led to growing – though currently unfounded – concern that the federal government could eventually take steps to ban self-custody.  Oklahoma’s crypto bill gets ahead of any hypothetical future ban by making the right to self-custody crypto, in either a self-hosted wallet or hardware wallet, fundamental. It also protects the ability to use crypto to purchase legal goods and services, and to do so without an extra tax “based solely on the use of the digital asset as the method of payment.”  The crypto bill also makes it legal for Oklahoma residents to mine crypto, both at home and on an industrial scale, provided they comply with local noise ordinances. Oklahoma has been a popular destination for crypto mining companies – in February, Polaris Technologies announced it was spending $100 million to build a 200 megawatt mining facility outside of Tulsa.  By protecting the right to mine in Oklahoma, the bill wards off any future attempts – such as those seen in New York and North Carolina – to ban crypto mining. It also ensures that anyone mining crypto or otherwise operating a node will not be required to obtain a money transmitter license, and ensures that anyone operating a node or staking as a service “shall not face liability related to a specific transaction merely by validating that transaction.”  The bill will go into effect on November 1, 2024.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MINING | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/05/15/sweeping-bitcoin-rights-bill-becomes-law-in-oklahoma,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1a68a6e2b635c9286230b05008f54a14dbcf33cb-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Although momentum appears to be picking up, bulls are not out of the woods just yet. Analysts are not losing hope and remain overly upbeat, expecting a surge that would take the world’s most valuable coin to new levels. Bitcoin Forms A “Cup And Handle” Formation In The Weekly Chart In a post on X, one of them, MikybullCrypto, said Bitcoin has formed a “cup and handle” reversal pattern, suggesting an imminent surge towards new all-time highs. This formation is a glimmer of hope for optimistic traders, especially now that prices have been moving lower and sideways, erasing gains posted in March. The “cup and handle” formation is a technical pattern chartists use to identify potential reversals and confirm trend continuations. In the current setup, as identified by the trader on the weekly chart, the “handle” was formed after the recent price drop from all-time highs. The “cup” follows the price decline in 2022 and the subsequent recovery in 2023. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Shares Top AI Altcoin Investments This Month Historically, if there is a breakout above the handle and the rim of the cup, prices tend to rally to new levels. For this reason, the analyst says that if buyers press on from spot rates, the breakout above the current range and all-time highs of $73,800 will be “explosive.” For now, prices remain in a descending channel with clear resistance levels marked out in the immediate term at around $66,000 and $72,000. A breakout, reading from the candlestick formation in the daily chart, above these liquidation levels could spark demand, lifting the coin to new levels. Will Miners Dump BTC And Force Prices Lower? However, lurking beneath the optimistic outlook is a potential storm cloud: declining on-chain activity. After the brief spike in on-chain activity on Halving Day due to the launch of the Runes protocol, transaction fees have been declining. According to YCharts, it is currently at $3.206, down from over $128 on April 20. This contraction means miners are getting less revenue, heaping more pressure now that there is more pressure on margins post-Halving. Related Reading: XRP To Nearly $600? Analyst Makes Bold Claim, But Can It Overcome Legal Hurdles? Now that miners are feeling the pinch of slashed block rewards and declining transaction fees, it is likely that they might liquidate some of their BTC to stay afloat.

42408235,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaBU10,1715798100,The Protocol: Lido Backers vs EigenLayer,"I must admit to choking on my tequila drink a couple weeks ago after hearing the phrase ""investable asset class"" applied to the category of digital tokens known as meme coins. But for many investors and projects, the opportunity is being taken quite seriously. See our riff below.  ALSO:  SCOOP: Lido backers are stealthily funding a competitor to EigenLayer.  JUST IN: Brothers accused by U.S. authorities of exploiting MEV-boost, the software used by most Ethereum validators, and stealing $25M.  Vitalik Buterin hammered out an Ethereum improvement proposal in 22 minutes flat.  With Colony Lab's new ""liquid vesting"" feature, you can have your bags and keep them too.  Runes transactions appear to have tapered off.  Top picks from the past week's Protocol Village column: Hyperbolic, Lens, zkSync, Polkadot, CoinDCX, Cyber, OP Stack.  $100 million of blockchain project fundraisings: Polymarket, Humanity Protocol, Owlto, Arcium, AgriDex, Zest, Hylé.  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Also please check out our weekly The Protocol podcast.  Network news  MEME RUSH! An industry source told me over margaritas a few weeks ago, ""You're starting to hear venture capital firms make the argument that meme coins are becoming an investable asset class."" What's undeniable is that meme coins are popping, and there does appear to be a thriving industry in promoting them. In April alone, CoinMarketCap added 138 meme coins to its listings, versus 18 in the same month a year earlier, bringing the total to 2,229, with a market capitalization of more than $50 billion, as reported by our Omkar Godbole. Last week, VanEck, a crypto-friendly institutional investment firm, started a new Meme Coin Index, tracking prices of doggy-themed tokens dogecoin (DOGE) and dogwifhat (WIF) as well as other ridiculousness like BONK. Another dog token, FLOKI, shared the title sponsorship for a cricket series between Pakistan and Ireland. Crypto analysts are talking up the election-related meme coins TRUMP and BODEN, and tokens associated with the X-Men character Wolverine flooded several blockchains after TheRoaringKitty, the personality behind the GameStop meme stock frenzy, posted a related video on X. Even independent Bitcoin programmer Jimmy Song, often a vocal critic of non-Bitcoin token creation, wrote in a Substack post that he appreciated the ""honesty"" of the movement: ""Meme coins obsoleted the VCs and ultimately brought some more honesty to the Nietzschean will-to-power games that were always being played."" Speaking of Bitcoin, the OG blockchain now has meme coins too, many of them created with the Runes protocol launched last month. Sovryn, a decentralized trading platform with Ethereum-compatible smart contracts and secured by Bitcoin through merge-mining on the Rootstock sidechain, announced Wednesday that it has created a fully-premined rune called POWA, airdropped the tokens to users and established pools for trading them. ""Runes provide a way for projects to create and distribute tokens natively on the Bitcoin blockchain for memes,"" Sovryn said in a press release.  STAKERS NOW RESTAKERS? Our Sam Kessler has the scoop: ""The co-founders of Lido, the biggest liquid staking protocol on Ethereum, are secretly funding a competitor to EigenLayer, the buzzy ""restaking"" service that has emerged rapidly this year to become a powerful force in decentralized finance. According to several people with knowledge of the matter, the project is called Symbiotic and has drawn backing from not only the Lido co-founders, Konstantin Lomashuk and Vasiliy Shapovalov, through their venture firm Cyber Fund, but also Paradigm, the crypto venture capital firm that is one of Lido's lead investors. CoinDesk also obtained internal Symbiotic documents that describe the project, which allows users to ""restake"" using Lido's staked ether (stETH) token and other popular assets that are not natively compatible with EigenLayer.""  JUST IN: Two brothers have been arrested by the U.S. Department of Justice for attacking the Ethereum blockchain and stealing $25 million of cryptocurrency during a 12-second exploit, according to an indictment unsealed on Wednesday.  THE WORDS OF VITALIK. We've written quite a bit in The Protocol newsletter about just how prolific (and prolix) the Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin can be as a writer. It's also true that when he writes, people tend to write a lot about whatever he writes – such as this opus on ""multidimensional gas pricing,"" which Decrypt covered. But apparently Buterin is also crazy fast as a scribbler, especially when it comes to banging out Ethereum improvement proposals on deadline, as chronicled on Tuesday by our Margaux Nijkerk. With time ticking down toward an important meeting to discuss new Ethereum wallet standards, it took Buterin just 22 minutes to draft EIP-7702, offered as a substitute for an earlier proposal, EIP-3074, that had drawn complaints from some developers. The hot-off-the-press publication drew plaudits from critics, with much of the Ethereum community quickly coming around in support of replacing the earlier effort with Buterin's proposed solution.  The courtroom where Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev was sentenced. (Camomile Shumba/CoinDesk)  Alexey Pertsev, 31, a developer of the coin mixer Tornado Cash, has been found guilty of money laundering by a Dutch judge, and was given 64 months of prison time. The case, along with other recent actions brought by prosecutors around the world, has raised questions about the extent of responsibility that developers might bear for any code they write. As reported by our Camomile Shumba, prosecutors in the Dutch case made the argument that Pertsev ""should have at least suspected the criminal origins of illicit transactions on the Tornado Cash platform.""  Solana-based crypto trading protocol Cypher has endured its share of hacks and heists. But its latest loss was an inside job. On Tuesday, a pseudonymous developer known as Hoak admitted to stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies from Cypher's hack reimbursement fund. ""I took the funds and gambled them away,"" Hoak said in a statement, blaming his activity on a ""crippling gambling addiction.""  El Salvador set up a new website to track its $350 million bitcoin stockpile, Bitcoin Magazine reported.  Degen Chain, an Ethereum layer-3 blockchain dedicated to meme coins, came back online after a two-day outage. (Launched in March, Degen Chain is an ""an ultra-low-cost L3 for the Degen community built with Arbitrum Orbit, Base for settlement, and AnyTrust for data availability,"" according to a blog post at the time by Syndicate, the blockchain's infrastructure partner.)  ICYMI: CoinDesk's Danny Nelson takes a look inside the shadowy world of crypto influencers known as ""key opinion leaders,"" or KOLs, who invest in the projects they promote on social media – in return for the privilege of selling out before other investors.  Protocol Village  Top picks of the past week from our Protocol Village column, highlighting key blockchain tech upgrades and news.  Hyperbolic's Proof of Sampling architecture (Zhang et al)  1. Hyperbolic, the two-year-old startup that math olympian Jasper Zhang leads focused on decentralized AI computing, said Thursday that it is introducing a protocol called “Proof of Sampling (PoSP),” aimed at addressing challenges with trust in decentralized AI networks. Hyperbolic was co-founded in 2022 by Zhang and Yuchen Jin, who holds a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Washington.  2. Lens Lab, a part of the Stani Kulechov-led Avara and the team behind Lens Protocol, a Web3 social platform built on Polygon PoS, announced that it is now developing its own blockchain network, Lens Network. The new network will be built on Matter Labs' ZK Stack, powered by zkSync on Ethereum. ""The Lens Network will set a new baseline/precedent for how social networks should be built,"" Alex Gluchowski, co-founder and CEO of Matter Labs, said in a press release.  3. Polkadot, the layer-1 chain ecosystem co-founded by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, has debuted Asynchronous Backing, according to the team: It sets the stage for Polkadot 2.0, ""a wave of enhancements expected to significantly improve the scalability, cost, speed and flexibility of the network, and accelerate growth of decentralized applications,"" according to the team. ""Asynchronous Backing cuts block time in half (from 12 to 6 seconds) enables parallel transaction validation block production, and delivers up to 10x higher throughput for Polkadot's parachain consensus protocol.""  4. Indian crypto exchange CoinDCX has expanded what started as the Okto wallet into an Okto ecosystem, which will include launching a blockchain, a token, and a points program starting Tuesday. The aim is to give global users a single-click mobile experience while traversing the Web3 space, its co-founders Neeraj Khandelwal and Sumit Gupta told CoinDesk in an interview.  5. Cyber, the just-unveiled rebranding for the developer formerly known as CyberConnect, has launched its own layer-2 network in the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem, describing it as the ""first L2 for social."" According to the team, the new chain relies on ""top modular solutions. Cyber integrates Optimism’s OP Stack, EigenDA and custom features to provide low fees, high TPS and a user-friendly experience."" According to a blog post: ""AltLayer will manage the rollup’s technical launch, ongoing management, operations and future upgrades.""

'Liquid Vesting' Is Oxymoronic Blockchain Feature That Lets Early Investors Sell Without Waiting  Avalanche Incubator Colony Lab Co-founders Wessal Erradi and Elie Le Rest (Colony Lab)  Even in anything-goes crypto trading, there are conventions designed to protect the little guy.  One of those is the vesting period – a window of time following a digital-token sale or airdrop where early investors, such as founders, project contributors and venture-capital backers, are locked up from dumping their allocations.  Projects typically do this so that the price of that token doesn’t crash immediately after a listing, say if big stakeholders were to sell right away. Another goal is to make sure insiders and early backers keep skin in the game, an assurance of good faith, as it were.  Now comes a new feature from Colony Lab, a developer and project incubator in the Avalanche blockchain ecosystem, called ""liquid vesting.""  If it sounds like a workaround, that's because it basically is. Have your bags and keep them too. Take liquidity now, without having to wait for the end of the vesting period.  Click here for the full article by CoinDesk's Margaux Nijkerk  Money Center  Fundraisings  Polymarket, the cryptocurrency-based prediction market platform that's enjoying a breakout year in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election, raised $45 million in a series B funding round with a roster of big-name investors. Billionaire Peter Thiel's Founders Fund is the lead investor.  Humanity Protocol, a zero-knowledge decentralized identity project looking to compete with Worldcoin, raised $30 million, claiming a valuation of $1 billion, in a seed funding round led by Kingsway Capital.  Owlto Finance, an intent-centric interoperability protocol, raised $8 million in a strategic funding round led by Bixin Ventures and CE Innovation Capital, with participation from Hailstone Labs, Skyland Ventures, Presto Labs and SNZ Capital.  Arcium, the first parallelized confidential computing network, has announced the completion of a $5.5 million strategic funding round led by Greenfield Capital.  AgriDex, a Solana-based tokenization platform, has raised $5 million to bring agricultural commodities on-chain. The pre-seed funding round included investments from Endeavour Ventures, sub-Sarahan African agricultural group African Crops and South African vineyard group Oldenburg Vineyards.  Bitcoin lending protocol Zest has raised $3.5 million to enable bitcoin (BTC) holders to deploy their assets in on-chain and generate yield. The seed raise was led by billionaire investor Tim Draper with participation from Binance Labs, Flow Traders, Trust Machines and others, Zest Protocol announced by email on Monday. Zest Protocol uses the Nakamoto upgrade by Bitcoin layer 2 Stacks.  Hylé, a blockchain that specializes in zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) verification, announced the closing of a $2.6 million funding round led by Framework Ventures, a crypto-native venture capital firm.

(As a plug: I'm scheduled to interview Rodarmor onstage on May 31 at CoinDesk's Consensus conference in Austin.) Even as recently as last week, Runes accounted for a majority of all transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, outpacing the original bitcoin as well as Ordinals inscriptions and the rival fungible-token standard BRC-20.  But the Runes frenzy has now faded somewhat. Runes has been ""written off as a flop, with waning interest failing to match the hype,"" according to a report by the blockchain analysis firm Coin Metrics. The analysts noted, however, that there may still be hope for a resurgence: ""Runes are yet to be validated in the form of listings on major exchanges, trading largely on niche collectibles platforms."" Transactions related to the new protocol appear to be ticking down:  Runes transactions of all types have shrunk since the launch around April 20.

27861245,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608218,1715796041,Analyst Predicts Shiba Inu to Soar 50% Amidst Meme Coin Market Rise,"Well-known cryptocurrency expert and enthusiast Dami Defi has offered his insights on the price action of Shiba Inu, predicting a surge in the crypto asset as the Meme coin market sees a fresh wave of demand. Given the optimism around meme coins lately, Dami Defi is confident that Shiba Inu could rise by over 50% shortly. Shiba Inu Price Could Rise By 20% Shiba Inu (SHIB) has become one of the leading meme coins, attracting positive outlooks from several analysts in the crypto space today. Even though Shiba Inu began the week on a negative note, Dami Defi believes the meme coin can potentially surge in the short term. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts 350% Surge For Shiba Inu – Here’s The Target According to Dami Defi, the digital asset’s price has formed a descending wedge pattern in the 1-day timeframe. Should SHIB break out of this falling wedge pattern, Dami Defi anticipates an over 50% surge in Shiba Inu’s price. This 50% increase will take the crypto asset from its present price to the $0.000035 level. The analyst predictions align with Ali Martinez’s forecast, highlighting that the digital asset’s price is moving in a descending parallel channel. While Dami Defi anticipates an over 50% price surge for Shiba Inu, Martinez expects the crypto asset to rise by over 20% in the short term. Martinez’s anticipated 20% increase will take the crypto asset from the $0.00002444 price to the $0.00002954 level. Martinez appears bullish on Shiba Inu, as he had predicted the asset to reach $0.000072323. He highlighted that SHIB on the daily chart seems to be forming a bull flag, indicating an impending movement on the upside. Due to this, the expert opened trade at around $0.000018343 in hopes of a strong breakout that will take Shiba Inu to $0.000072323. Martinez’s prognosis, fueled by March’s rally, indicates that SHIB’s value may rise even further, providing investors in this thriving and active sector of the cryptocurrency market with a positive outlook for the meme coin. SHIB Predicted To Repeat 2021 Price Trend Or Even Better Shiba Inu’s marketing head, Lucie, delved into the memecoin’s price action. Lucie claims that during October 2021, SHIB, with no burns and no significant adoption at the time, witnessed a surge from $0.000007 to $0.000088 in just a matter of days, indicating an over 1,100% rise. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Crypto Analyst Says Massive Surge Is Coming, Here’s The Target With the massive burns and widespread seen today within the SHIB ecosystem, Lucie might be suggesting the potential for the asset to reiterate this move or even further in this bull cycle. If this trend repeats, SHIB’s price might reach $0.00025 in this bull cycle. Lucie also underscored the consistent support by SHIB’s robust community and strong Shibarium ecosystem since 2021, which might also catalyze Shiba Inu’s growth. At the time of writing, SHIB was trading at $0.00002366, demonstrating an increase of over 4% in the past week. Despite the price rise, its market cap has been down by 2.59%, while its trading volume has been up by 1.79% in the past day. Given the momentum in the meme coin market, SHIB may be able to see more gains in the coming months.

42408200,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaBTaY,1715794637,DePIN’s Solution to AI’s Biggest Blind Spot,"It’s the year 2030 and you’ve sent your humanoid robot to go buy ketchup at the grocery store. It’s a capable walker, it has dexterous hands, and it can carry more groceries than any parent. High-resolution cameras, gyroscopes and pressure sensors help the robot move quietly through the aisles with such grace that you almost forget that it is hopelessly lost. Like its human counterparts, it is doomed to wander aimlessly around the store taking bets on if this is the kind of store that keeps the ketchup in the condiments or sauces aisle.  Nils Pihl, CEO and Founder ofAuki Labs, is an entrepreneur, behavioral engineer and social transhumanist specializing in the intersection of modern technology and human behavior.  Fully 65% of American grocery shoppers spend over half an hour in the store per shopping trip, and the average shopper also leaves without an item they couldn’t find every third visit. Without some pretty significant overhauls to how robots and computers understand and navigate the physical world, there’s not much reason to believe that your humanoid robot would fare any better — not without a decentralized machine perception network, perhaps the most vital DePIN for a future with independent robotic agents.  Spatial computing and privacy.  Like humans, machines either navigate by memory or guidance. For decades, the most common way for machines and humans to get guidance has been through geopositioning satellites like the GPS. As our cities have grown, however, the GPS is starting to show its age.  Although you rarely think about it, the GPS is a line-of-sight based technology that requires an uninterrupted path between you and several satellites. That’s why it works so poorly in big cities and indoor environments.  Several advancements have been made to try to fill in the gaps. One of the first, from the early days of mobile computing, was to quietly have cellphones measure the signal strength to every WiFi router they passed. Over time, thanks to complex triangulation, companies like Skyhook and Google have managed to create low-resolution maps showing the locations of many of the world's WiFi routers. This is why navigation applications like Google Maps will ask you to turn on your WiFi to get better results.  In the last decade, critics raised many privacy concerns and lawsuits related to WiFi triangulation And it is fair to say that, unfortunately, privacy lost that battle. It is of some consolation, perhaps, that WiFi triangulation still only helps the average user position themselves to within a few meters — not enough for our ketchup-fetching robot to even correctly understand what aisle it’s in.  And so, big tech has turned to the next promising advance in geolocation: visual positioning systems. Spearheaded by companies like Niantic and Snap, visual positioning systems (VPS) compare the world as seen by an onboard camera to an external memory of what the world looks like, stored on their centrally controlled cloud. In a nutshell, a VPS is a trade where you tell big tech what you are looking at so that they can tell where you are.  Visual positioning systems are accurate down to the centimeter in ideal circumstances, and accurate to under a meter in many public urban spaces. It’s because of this unparalleled precision that big tech companies are betting on the VPS for the future of robotics and AR glasses.  But that should make us pause. Remembering the many privacy violations of the simpler bygone days of mobile social media — how will we fare when big tech companies can see the world through our very eyes, and our homes and private spaces through our machine companions?  Corporations need privacy, too  If you walk into a grocery store and start filming the shelves you’ll quickly find yourself escorted out of the store. Products placed at eye level are more likely to be picked up and bought, and retailers put careful thought into how they place their products to maximize sales. As such, the visual merchandising layout of stores are carefully guarded competitive secrets.  Simply put, the stores are not interested in sharing the product layout of their stores with a central service. It would be unreasonable to expect that our robot could simply show up at the store and instantly know where every single product is, because it would undermine the intellectual property of the store.  Instead, the best we can hope for is that the store has its own self-hosted and secure system that can answer robot questions about individual products, and guide AI and AR glasses to where they need to go without compromising corporate security.  The attentive reader will already spot where DePIN is promising to outperform the giants of the Web2 era, and bring us our ketchup in a privacy-preserving way.  Unlike humans, robots and computers could exchange spatial data with each other, collaboratively perceiving the world together. Collaborative spatial computing would allow machines to navigate the world better by connecting to other external sources of information. In a Web3 DePIN paradigm, this exchange can both be financially incentivized and cryptographically secure.  Decentralized machine perception networks  Imagining that our grocery shopping robot could find the ketchup faster without compromising corporate security is a cute example. But the implications of decentralized machine perception are staggering. Once self-driving cars can coordinate with each other, and exchange live traffic information, traffic will be radically transformed.  In Beijing, where there are more cars on the road than there are people in Los Angeles, over 1,000 years of human productivity are lost in transit every single day. Decentralized machine perception would allow these cars to move faster in coordination with each other, unlocking hundreds of years of productivity daily.  Decentralized machine perception will one day allow for privacy-preserving AR glasses with a smaller form factor, as the glasses can offload some of the heavy spatial computing to local positioning servers, and change human communication in ways as profound as the invention of writing or the telephone. As our civilization grows to over 100 billion intelligent decision makers over the next twenty years, decentralized machine perception networks will help each and every one of them find their place in the world, both on Earth and beyond.

42408204,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaBTkT,1715793493,Rafael Cordón: Safeguarding Elections With Bitcoin,"Rafael Cordón is concerned about how we’re going to protect the truth in the age of AI and disinformation. The Guatemalan tech CEO and engineer began thinking about this issue in the wake of Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. But never did he consider he might create a technology that would protect a presidential election in his home country from being undermined via a flagrant attempt to tamper with physical voting documents. Yet, this is what he’s done with Simple Proof, an immutable record keeping system that safeguards data using the Bitcoin blockchain.  Who is Rafael Cordón?  Cordón is a native Guatemalan who jovially refers to himself as a “computer nerd.” He studied mechanical engineering for his undergraduate degree and completed a master’s degree in engineering management at Duke University in the late-2000s.  Frank Corva is the business-to-business correspondent at Bitcoin Magazine and host of the ""new renaissance capital"" podcast.  After working in Accenture’s IT department and consulting for bigger financial institutions, he felt the urge to start his own project. In 2017, while researching distributed databases, Cordón rediscovered Bitcoin (he’d read the Bitcoin white paper in 2011 and dismissed it at the time) and quickly fell down the proverbial Bitcoin rabbit hole.  One year later, he conceptualized Simple Proof and purchased the domain for it. Over the subsequent years, while founding and serving as the CTO for IBEX, a startup Bitcoin payment company based in Guatemala, Cordón continued to develop Simple Proof.  What is Simple Proof?  Simple Proof uses OpenTimestamps, an open-source protocol created by Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd in 2016. OpenTimestamps enables cryptographic timestamping, which is more trustworthy than human timestamping, because it relies on cryptographic algorithms to verify information as opposed to a human process. Here’s how it works in Cordón’s words:  “OpenTimestamps is an internet protocol that enables a user to interact with the Bitcoin blockchain in order to generate timestamps of documents,” says Cordón. “A digital fingerprint of a document is included through Merkle trees into a specific place inside a Bitcoin transaction called the OP_RETURN function. The OP_RETURN is where you write arbitrary text into a Bitcoin transaction. It’s like the ‘memo’ space [on] a check. This arbitrary text in our case is the proof of the document.”  The document he’s referring to is Document Number 4, the official name a vote tally sheet in Guatemalan elections.  In 2022, Cordón arranged with the Guatemalan government for Documents Number 4 from the then upcoming presidential election be timestamped onto the Bitcoin blockchain as they came in. The Guatemalan Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE), the highest electoral authority in Guatemala, would use Simple Proof to preserve the integrity of the election results.  But this begs the question: How do we know the information on the vote tally sheets that’s being uploaded to the Bitcoin blockchain is legitimate?  Guatemalan elections, decentralized  Like Bitcoin, Guatemalan elections are decentralized.  The process by which votes are collected and counted in Guatemalan elections is explained in the documentary Immutable Democracy, which tells the story of how Simple Proof was implemented in the 2023 Guatemalan presidential election.  More than 100,000 volunteers and 100,000 observers from different political parties and civil society watch over the creation and collection of over 150,000 Documents Number 4. The volunteer citizens who comprise the Vote Reception Boards watch as voters submit ballots at voting tables. At each table, the volunteers count the votes and transcribe the results onto their Documents Number 4. Other volunteers and observers watch as Documents Number 4 are completed.  The Documents Number 4 are then sent to the Elections Process Operations Center. There, almost 25,000 boxes of election materials, including the top layer of Documents Number 4 (each of these documents separates into three copies: the white original copy and a yellow and blue carbon copy), are transferred to the Municipal Elections Boards. Volunteer citizens calculate the results at this level. Those totals are then transferred to District Elections Boards, where volunteers tally results at the district and national levels. The tallies of the official results are then transferred to the TSE, where they are classified as official results.  The yellow carbon copy, an unofficial copy of the results, is scanned and uploaded digitally to a system whose name translates to the Preliminary Elections Results Transmission (TREP). Two different people scan each of these yellow documents to validate that the information on each of the documents was uploaded without distortion. The first person scans this sheet at the voting table. The second person scans it at the Municipal Elections Board level. If the two scans match, the results are published on TREP.gt for Guatemalan citizens to audit.  When I asked Cordón if he trusts this process, he responded with the following:  “You have 125,000 volunteers that are counting the votes, and you have election observers from the political parties, which are probably another 25,000 to 50,000 [people],” says Cordón. “Plus, you have external election observers from local civil society and international organizations. You're talking about 200,000 people [who] are involved in the election. I don't know how you can create a conspiracy between 200,000 people.”  The simple proof  As the unofficial digital versions of the vote tallies come in, a hash, or “Digital Fingerprint”, as Cordón puts it in Immutable Democracy, is generated for them. The hash is then saved through OpenTimestamps, which registers the data on the Bitcoin blockchain.  Through the TREP.gt website, anyone can audit the Documents Number 4. In the portal, they can click a button whose translated text reads “Verify Hash” and be brought to the Simple Proof’s website, where they can find the hash and Bitcoin block that contains the document as well as the exact time the document was received.  Documenting the exact time of verification is important because votes are counted and uploaded in real-time, and a vote tally sheet that’s uploaded long after votes have been counted has a better chance of being fraudulent.  Invalidating the Results of the Election  The unexpected victor of the 2023 Guatemalan presidential election was Bernardo Arévalo, a progressive candidate who ran on an anti-corruption platform. Shortly after the TSE declared Arévalo’s victory, his rival, Sandra Torres, filed court challenges in efforts to overturn the election, alleging fraud in the vote count, according to Time.  Torres’ party, UNE, claimed on X that some votes were uploaded prior to voting centers closing. This wasn’t true, though. The screenshot of the tally posted on X was taken in a time zone with a one-hour time difference from the time in which the voting center in question was located. La Hora, one of the biggest online news outlets in Guatemala, reported that UNE’s claim was false, citing information from the Simple Proof portal as evidence.  In the midst of Torres and her party, UNE, protesting the election, officials from the attorney general’s office raided the TSE facilities, opening boxes of votes and photographing their contents, according to AP. And two weeks after that, an agent from the national prosecutor’s office seized a box of election documents, including Documents Number 4, the video footage for which is featured in Immutable Democracy.  Democracy’s Last Stand  As mentioned, Cordón did not anticipate what unfolded in the wake of the presidential election. He was as surprised as anyone else to learn how fragile his country’s democracy was. As he recounts the story, he seems more disturbed by what happened than happy that Simple Proof played a role in protecting information from the election.  “I never thought that this would be democracy's last stand because the documents were taken away,” says Cordón. “They could have just edited [the documents] and said, ‘Hey, you committed fraud. We found the real document [and] it’s not what you uploaded into the TREP system.’ I don’t think these people understood what the [Simple Proof] meant when they violently took the documents. They only realized afterwards that there was nothing they could do in terms of altering the documents.”  Other governments to use Simple Proof?  Cordón as his team are speaking with different governments that are interested in using Simple Proof to verify election information. However, he warns that implementing Simple Proof isn’t a panacea.  “I want this to be used the right way. I don't want to blockchainwash something that's not done properly,” says Cordón. “If an authoritarian leader wants to use Simple Proof, I don’t want to be a part of it.”  Plus, political actors can still use AI or disinformation to distort what people see in the media or through other digital lenses, which can affect how people vote.  “As we consume more of our information through digital means, how do we know what is and isn't true?,” says Cordón. “We need to build tools to protect people, to protect ourselves, to protect the truth. Simple Proof is one solution that we think is helpful, but I hope more people get involved in solving this huge problem.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Frank Corva,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/05/15/rafael-cordon-safeguarding-elections-with-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b99a96b79fec98821fdfccdc81e2da72c156599c-511x512.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

27858631,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608133,1715792422,Ethereum Bull Flag Breakout: ATH On The Horizon As Major Metrics Turn Bullish,"Crypto analyst Javon Marks has highlighted several metrics that have turned bullish for Ethereum (ETH). The analyst noted that one of these metrics suggests an all-time high (ATH) for the second-largest crypto token. Bullish Metrics For Ethereum Marks remarked in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the bull flag-like price structure has formed on the Ethereum chart. He added that higher lows are forming in Ethereum’s price action, which is also a bullish signal as it suggests a strong resistance to downward trends. Meanwhile, the analyst claims lower lows in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicate a hidden bullish divergence with Ethereum’s price. Related Reading: Brace For Impact: Mt. Gox Set To Inject 142,000 BTC And 143,000 Bitcoin Cash Into The Market- Here’s When Marks then raised the possibility of Ethereum hitting a new ATH, stating that the “bull flag breakout might lead into new all-time highs and be of major service in many Altcoin progressions.” Before then, he claimed that Ethereum could soon experience a larger price breakout, making the crypto token experience a 63% upside to $4,811. Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe also recently suggested that Ethereum could make a major move soon enough and lead altcoins to make new highs. According to him, this will be triggered by the news surrounding the Ethereum ETF, as he expects that to be the “rotation for the Altcoins.” However, Ethereum also risks experiencing a significant decline, considering reports that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might reject the Ethereum ETF applications. Crypto analyst James Van Straten stated that a rejection of the Spot ETF “sends the ETHBTC ratio lower 0.047 to 0.03 as a long-term projection.” This was one of the reasons why the analyst stated that “Ethereum looks like it’s going to the grave.” He also alluded to the fact that ETH has become inflationary with the Decun upgrade reducing transaction fees, which has ultimately reduced ETH’s burn rate. Things Aren’t Looking Good For ETH Crypto analyst Derek recently mentioned that “Ethereum dominance and recent performance are heading toward their worst ever.” He noted that attention has turned to Bitcoin due to the reports about a potential rejection of the Ethereum ETF and securities status, which has put pressure on investment sentiment. According to him, this has caused the “imbalance in dominance” to reach its worst point. Related Reading: This Crypto Expert Called The Bitcoin Top in 2021, Now He’s Calling The Bottom In 2024 Derek further noted that Ethereum’s unimpressive price action is affecting other altcoins, as their prices are “depressed.” He also claimed that the prices of layer two coins “continued to be under pressure.” The analyst suggested that things could get worse, as the ETH/BTC chart shows a downward wedge pattern in progress. He claims that altcoins can only “breathe” if Ethereum can escape this pattern quickly. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $2906, down in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42408189,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaBTA6,1715790253,Brothers Accused of $25M Ethereum Exploit as U.S. Reveals Fraud Charges,"Two brothers have been arrested by the U.S. Department of Justice for attacking the Ethereum blockchain and stealing $25 million of cryptocurrency during a 12-second exploit, according to an indictment unsealed on Wednesday.  The indictment charges Anton Peraire-Bueno, 24, of Boston, and James Pepaire-Bueno, 28, of New York, with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering.  The charges are significant because they represent a first-of-its-kind criminal action from the U.S. government related to the controversial practice of MEV, or maximal extractable value, whereby the operators of Ethereum (and similar blockchains) preview upcoming transactions from users to earn an extra profit for themselves. The government suggests in the indictment that the very existence of MEV illustrates how Ethereum itself is a vulnerable system.  ""[T]he defendants’ scheme calls the very integrity of the blockchain into question,"" Damian Williams, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a press release.  What is MEV-Boost?  According to Wednesday's indictment, the Pepaire-Bueno brothers exploited MEV-boost, an MEV software used by most of the validators that run the Ethereum blockchain.  The indictment walks through how Ethereum works, highlighting its staking consensus mechanism and the role of validators as participants who secure the network.  Read more: What Is MEV, aka Maximal Extractable Value?  When users submit transactions to Ethereum, those transactions are not immediately written to the blockchain's ledger. Instead, they're added to a ""mempool"" – a waiting area for other yet-to-be-processed transactions.  MEV-boost lets ""block builders"" assemble those mempool transactions into official blocks. MEV bots called ""searchers"" scour the mempool for profitable trading opportunities and will sometimes ""bribe"" builders to insert or re-order transactions in a manner that would net them an extra profit. (These ""MEV strategies"" can sometimes eat into the profits of end users.)  Validators, the operators that ultimately add blocks to the Ethereum blockchain, take the pre-built blocks from MEV-boost and then write them to the chain, where they're cemented permanently.  The exploit  The Pepaire-Bueno brothers exploited a bug in MEV-boost's code that allowed them to preview the content of blocks before they were officially delivered to validators, according to the indictment.  The brothers created 16 Ethereum validators and targeted three specific traders who operated MEV bots, the indictment said. They used bait transactions to figure out how those bots traded, lured the bots to one of their validators which was validating a new block and basically tricked these bots into proposing certain transactions. The brothers allegedly frontran the bots on certain trades and also used their validator to ""tamper with"" the new block by sending a false digital signature that gave them access to the block's full contents and replaced ""lure transactions"" with ""tampered transactions."" In those tampered transactions, the brothers allegedly sold illiquid cryptocurrencies they had tricked the victims' trading bots into placing buy orders for.  ""In effect, the Victim Traders sold approximately $25 million of various stablecoins or other more liquid cryptocurrencies to purchase particularly illiquid cryptocurrencies,"" the document said. ""In effect, the Tampered Transactions drained the particular liquidity pools of all the cryptocurrency that the Victim Traders had deposited based on their frontrun trades.""  This meant the traders couldn't sell their new illiquid cryptos, which were ""rendered effectively worthless,"" while the defendants made off with the $25 million in stablecoins and other ""more liquid cryptocurrencies,"" the DOJ alleged.  The defendants then allegedly laundered the funds through various addresses and sets of transactions, including converting the stolen funds into DAI and then USDC.  “These brothers allegedly committed a first-of-its-kind manipulation of the Ethereum blockchain by fraudulently gaining access to pending transactions, altering the movement of the electronic currency, and ultimately stealing $25 million in cryptocurrency from their victims,” Special Agent in Charge Thomas Fattorusso of the IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) New York Field Office said in the statement.  The indictment walks through some of what investigators found, including ""a document setting forth their plans,"" the launch of shell companies, test transactions to identify best practices for attracting MEV bots and internet search histories.

42408212,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaBZpP,1715789040,House Resolution to Overturn Controversial SEC Rule Likely to Pass in Senate: Sources,"A House proposal to revoke the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 is likely to pass through the Senate in a vote on Thursday, multiple people familiar with the situation told CoinDesk.  A Senate source familiar with the situation told CoinDesk they expected a floor vote on Thursday in the late morning, and the bill was in a ""good position"" for passage.  ""There'll likely be more than one Democrat voting for it,"" the individual said.  In a statement, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) said she would support the resolution to overturn the bulletin, adding it ""has significant procedural and policy issues.""  ""The rule was issued without proper consultation with the respective regulatory agencies or Congress and without going thru a proper notice and comment period,"" she said. ""More importantly, it imposes an accounting approach that deviates from established standards, forcing financial institutions to count their customers’ digital assets as their own. This will limit options for consumers and leave them with less, not more consumer protection in cases of bankruptcy.""  SAB 121 intended to explain how businesses should account for crypto assets, saying they should hold these assets on their own balance sheets. Critics have argued the bulletin deters major custodians and other companies from holding crypto for customers at all. Last week, the House of Representatives voted to advance the House resolution that rejected the guidance.  If signed by U.S. President Joe Biden, the House resolution would disapprove of the bulletin and block the SEC from issuing any similar guidance in the future. The White House threatened to veto the resolution should it advance out of the Senate as well, saying it ""reflects considered SEC staff views.""  ""It could also inappropriately constrain the SEC’s ability to ensure appropriate guardrails and address future issues related to crypto-assets including financial stability,"" the veto notice said.  Despite the veto threat, 21 House Democrats and the vast majority of House Republicans voted to advance the resolution.  In a statement, the resolution's sponsor, Rep. Mike Flood (R-Neb.) said, ""We're hopeful that it passes the Senate this week, and I think it's getting the SEC's attention that we're serious.""  The resolution's other sponsor, Rep. Wiley Nickel (D-N.C.), wrote a letter to SEC Chair Gary Gensler earlier on Wednesday, which said the lawmaker had asked for time to discuss the bulletin with Gensler's office but had not received any response.  ""I strongly encourage you to withdraw SAB121 to protect investors and the financial system, bolster American competitiveness, and respect Congress’s role in the administrative rulemaking process,"" the letter said.

27855950,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608124,1715788854,Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Form Capitulation Signal: What It Means,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Hash Ribbons have recently gone through a crossover. Here’s what it could mean for the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Suggest Miner Capitulation Is On As explained by CryptoQuant community manager Maartunn in a Quicktake post, miners are capitulating right now if the Hash Ribbons indicator is to be believed. This on-chain metric is generally used to determine whether miners are in distress. BTC runs on a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism where miners play the role of validators and compete against each other using computing power to get a chance to add the next block to the chain. This computing power, when measured across the network, can provide insight into the health of the miners as a whole. Due to this reason, the Hash Ribbons indicator makes use of this total Bitcoin “Hashrate” to judge the situation of the miners. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Linked To Binance Vs Coinbase Battle, Quant Reveals Naturally, a rise in the Hashrate suggests the network is attracting miners right now, while a decline could imply low profitability is making some of these validators pull out from BTC. The Hash Ribbons indicator uses two moving averages (MA) of the Hashrate, 30-day and 60-day, to represent whether these behaviors are particularly intense or not at the moment. When the 30-day ribbon moves under the 60-day one, it suggests that miners are mass capitulating. On the other hand, the opposite cross suggests network is observing growth again. Now, what relevance do these trends have for Bitcoin? According to Charles Edwards, the creator of the Hash Ribbons, the miners have historically been quite resilient, and they only quit when things get especially bad for the cryptocurrency. As such, the market may be more likely to approach a bottom whenever these chain validators show capitulation. Below is a chart that shows how the miners’ behaviour has looked recently according to this indicator: As Maartunn has highlighted in the graph, the Bitcoin Hash Ribbons have seen a crossover recently. More specifically, the cross has involved the 30-day moving under the 60-day, implying that the miners are capitulating. Miner profits come down to three factors: BTC spot price, transaction fees, and electricity costs in the area that they are located in. Historically, the fees has been quite low in comparison to the block rewards, so miner financials have been dependent on the price (as the block rewards only have this variable attached to them) and electricity prices. Recently, the BTC price has been stuck in consolidation while the block rewards have been slashed in half in the latest Halving event. This has led to tightening revenues for these chain validators, so it’s not surprising to see that the miners with the least efficient machines have already started ditching the network in hordes. Related Reading: Newbie Bitcoin Whales Buying 200,000 BTC Per Week, Data Shows In the chart, past instances of miner capitulation are shown with the green lines. It’s visible that while miner capitulation has generally indeed occurred near profitable buying points into the asset, these bottoms haven’t immediately appeared after the crossovers have occurred. As the analyst notes, “It unfolds in the subsequent days and weeks after less efficient miners throw in the towel.” BTC Price Bitcoin has continued to move overall flat over the past week as its price is still trading around $62,700.

Currently,32.5 million ($99 billion) ETH has been staked, and the amount of staked ETH has grown by 78% since Ethereum’s Shanghai Upgrade in April 2023.  Despite the impressive growth, only27% of the ETH in circulation has been staked. Comparatively, other proof-of-stake networks such as Solana, Cardano, SUI, Avalanche and Aptos have a much higher staking ratio, between48%-81%.  In other words, staking on Ethereum can grow larger, potentially fueled by the adoption of Liquid Staking or Liquid Restaking Tokens on Layer 2 networks and DeFi protocols.

Source: 21co on Dune Analytics  EIP 7251 to drive more volume  The next Ethereum upgrade, Pectra, will likely take place by the end of 2024, or in early 2025. One of the key proposals, EIP 7251, can provide a better UX for validators to earn staking yield. This proposal will increase the max effective balance of validators from 32 to 2048. Leading staking service providers, like Coinbase, are managing more than130,000 validators already. The lift in maximum effective balance allows these providers to consolidate the number of validators and ultimately increase efficiency and lower the cost of operation.  Another benefit is that solo stakers can enjoy auto-compounding their staking rewards. At the current stage, solo stakers’ staking reward will be withdrawn to the execution layer automatically. The reward received will no longer accrue staking yield. Solo stakers will need to wait until they have 32 ETH before spinning up another validator to capture the staking reward.  Restaking is the new catalyst  Restaking has been an exciting primitive on Ethereum. Together with the points program from both EigenLayer and liquid restaking protocols, it creates a new wave of demand for ETH staking. In March and April 2024, respectively, 38% and 48% of the staking volume came s from liquid staking protocols.  At the same time, over65% ($9.7B) of EigenLayer’s TVL comes from native ETH, showing the level of traction that restaking is able to bring to Ethereum. With the maturity and adoption of restaking, we could see more staking volume comes from restaking and liquid restaking in the future.  However, it is also important to note that restaking comes with risks, such as smart contracts and the quality of the actively validated services. Given the reward and slashing mechanism of EigenLayer has not been activated, we are yet to see the full ramifications of restaking, both good and bad.

42408243,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaBajc,1715787900,Halving Impact and Macro Shifts Create Tailwinds for Bitcoin,"The fourth Bitcoin halving in April reduced the new bitcoin issuance rate to 3.125 BTC every ten minutes, sparking significant interest and speculation. Since then, Bitcoin has been down from its highs, with some investors concerned that the days of higher BTC prices are in the distant future.  We believe March’s new high (above $70,000) was a ""head fake"" driven by new spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, considering the halving event and ongoing supply/demand issues, we expect a brighter future for BTC and crypto as the year progresses.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Why do some pundits think Bitcoin has topped? And why did the selloff occur? Unlike past halvings, Bitcoin's price soared to a new high of $73,750 with a market cap of $1.44 trillion on March 14, a month before the halving. The rapid increase from the start of the year, when it was as low as $39,000, scared speculative investors and those in it for the ""halving trade,"" prompting them to cash out.  However, the retreat likely stemmed from macro factors, specifically hawkish comments by the Federal Reserve. These ignited a ""risk-off"" mentality as an interest rate cut became more unlikely in 2024, with a hike becoming possible. Since then, economic data has been weaker than expected, making a hike very unlikely for now. This shift has put the risk trade back on, setting an immediate floor in BTC prices, which have since recovered above $60,000. It also suggests a shift back to supply and demand factors for bitcoin, which appear favorable for higher prices.  There are several reasons to be bullish on Bitcoin and crypto.  First, the past three halvings have consistently led to new all-time highs in Bitcoin price in the months following the event. We believe this trend will accelerate as more institutional investors include BTC in their portfolios, further tightening the supply. This “rising tide"" in BTC should lift all crypto boats.  Second, the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 is a pivotal development. These ETFs, allowing investors to trade shares through existing retail brokerage accounts, promise wider availability through financial advisors. Firms such as Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, and LPL are conducting due diligence on their platforms for availability. Approval on these platforms seems inevitable, enhancing accessibility and simplifying the investment process in Bitcoin, which will likely lead to much higher demand.  Third, regulatory developments in the global crypto markets will significantly influence Bitcoin's price dynamics. The potential passage of a U.S. bill establishing a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and Europe's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation is crucial. They will help dispel the notion that BTC and crypto are mere ""pet rocks,"" acknowledging them as stores of value with technological utility. This shift in perception can transform Bitcoin and crypto from speculative instruments to strategic investments and, potentially, a flight-to-quality investment.  Remember that a complex interplay of market dynamics, investor sentiment, technological advancements and macroeconomic events influences Bitcoin's price. I am bullish on BTC and crypto and will watch closely as the post-halving market continues.

The cash will fund hiring and development costs, with a testnet release planned for the second half.  Humanity Protocol, a zero-knowledge decentralized identity project looking to compete with Worldcoin, said it was valued at $1 billion in a seed funding round led by Kingsway Capital.  The $30 million round, which follows a $1.5 million investment from a combination of angel investors and key opinion leaders in early March, included Animoca Brands, Blockchain.com and Hashed among others, the team said in a post on Medium.  The protocol uses palm scans and a consensus mechanism it calls Proof of Humanity to uniquely verify a user's identity within a decentralized system. Worldcoin, co-founded by Sam Altman, has similar aims and went live last July using a specialized iris-scanning tool. That piqued the interest of several privacy regulators, including those of France, the U.K. and Kenya.  ""Proof-of-Personhood is a powerful concept but the solutions that exist today haven't seen adoption because onboarding is invasive and high friction."" founder Terence Kwok said in the post. ""We're creating a decentralized identity protocol that solves verifiable uniqueness and humanity in a way that protects user privacy and self-ownership of data.”  The team at Humanity Protocol plans to use the funds for hiring and product development.

42408215,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaBZw1,1715781728,"Crypto Old-Head Otoh Talks Casascius Bitcoins, Tax Havens and Old Friends","It’s quite likely that Otoh has lost more bitcoin than most people will ever hold. An early bitcoin investor, Otoh, a pseudonym that stands for “on the other hand,” has many lessons to share about finding opportunities and making one’s own luck.  Otoh is a speaker at this year’s Consensus festival, in Austin, Texas, May 29-31.  Scheduled to speak on stage at Consensus 2024, in Austin, Texas, alongside crypto luminaries like Litecoin creator Charlie Lee and BTCC and Ballet founder Bobby Lee, Otoh is known among the early crypto crowd for his massive holdings of physical bitcoins – a.k.a. Casascius coins.  “I've never sold any. I’ve just been accumulating them as my version of a cold storage,” Otoh told CoinDesk in an interview, discussing his recent auction of over 200 worth of physical bitcoins in what was the Heritage auction firm’s first crypto sale.  Casascius coins, created by Mike Caldwell (who went by Casascius, an acronym for “call a spade a spade,” on Bitcoin forums), were a solution to spending bitcoin in face-to-face transactions by embedding a Bitcoin private key in a metal coin.  The last ones were made in 2013 after the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network told Caldwell that he was operating an unlicensed money transmitter business. There are only about 90,000 Casascius coins in circulation, of varying denominations, though other manufacturers including Bobby Lee created their own versions.  A part of Bitcoin lore and its physical history, Casascius coins are now sought after by collectors (some are so valuable that they have to be declared to U.S. Customs when entering the country). In some sense, these coins are the most long lived and recognizable image of the purely a digital currency.  “It seemed the right time to let some of the physical coins go,” Otoh said. “Let other people look after them and enjoy having them.”  Of course, part of the danger of bringing bitcoin into the physical realm is that it makes the assets as easy to steal as a $20 note from mom’s purse – and unfortunately, Otoh thinks he was the victim of a theft about a decade ago. He recounted a story of receiving a shipment of coins where the box had been obviously tampered with.  The 55 BTC missing from his collection were worth about $20,000 at the time they were purchased, and are now worth about $3.5 million, “which is a huge sum in most anyone's book,” he said. “I'm very happy to offer a half a million dollar reward for their return. And unconditionally, I wouldn't want to press charges if someone decided to give them back to me,” he added.  See also: Why, for Some, Crypto Is the Defining Political Issue of Our Times | Opinion  CoinDesk caught up with Otoh ahead of Consensus to discuss his recent auction of vintage physical bitcoins, early investments in other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum’s initial coin offering and how he manages his wealth by diversifying into properties around the world and residing in a tax haven in the British Channel Islands.  Could you give a sense of what you’re talking about at Consensus?  I’m on the panel about physical bitcoins. I'm basically a fill-in for Mike Caldwell, who invented Casascius coins, who couldn't make it unfortunately.  Oh, that's so cool.  Would be nice to meet him one day. Bobby Lee and Charlie Lee asked if I'd be a substitute for the gap on the panel because I am a large investor.  Do you remember buying your first coin?  Yes, very much. It was at the London Bitcoin Conference in 2012. I had just started on bitcoin in the summer of 2011, around July. I remember at the time I met with some German guys – there were all these privacy advocates wearing masks who had a whole bunch of physical coins to sell. I believe it was 10 regular bitcoins and a 10 bitcoin unit piece. The price at the time, with the premium and everything, was $12 a bitcoin.  What does Otoh stand for?  It’s an acronym for “on the other hand.” That's how it's usually used. I just adopted it because I find myself, a lot of the time, not necessarily being argumentative but looking at different viewpoints. I thought bitcoin and crypto is also a different way of looking at finance. Nearly everyone had a nickname on the BitcoinTalk forum. That's the way that came about, but I didn't give it much thought at the time. It was just the first thing that came into my head.  Are there any particular memories of the early days of Bitcoin that you remember fondly?  Fondly? Yes, that must be getting my first coin – that was a big deal. At the time people were still giving away free coins. By the time I joined, word had spread, and it often wasn't a full coin anymore, just a fraction of a coin, but it was still fun to have my own address and then be sent this little token amount of coins to see how it could function.  At the time I was traveling between Europe and the States quite a bit and also buying and selling in Europe and the States. With bitcoin, it suddenly became really easy to send money.  A few of the other memories are more traumatic. It's very easy to mess up. As you learn as you go.  You've probably lost more bitcoins than most people have today.  If you count the ones that were stolen off me. Like that list I just gave you that I put together from nine years ago. Somewhere out there there is a lost, stolen treasure of a few million dollars.  What do you suspect happened there? A rogue employee?  I think it is most likely a rogue U.S. Postal Service employee who just used a box cutter and saw something that looked promising. He probably thought it was Gold Eagles or Silver Eagles or something. I don't know what the reaction would be, whether they were disgusted to see it was just some weird tokens and threw them away or whether they thought “Oh, this looks cool.”  I’ve always hoped that I’d have a brainstorm and remember if I’ve stashed them away somewhere. But it doesn't make any sense – I've got everything else very well looked after and itemized. A friend of mine whose house I had been staying in at that time remembers receiving a box that was cut open and resealed.  Is there anything that you want to say about the OTOH Collection of Physical Cryptocurrency?  Well, after a decade, I decided it's time to sell. I've never sold any, I’ve just been accumulating them as my version of a cold storage. Now that I've sold all my digital crypto, it seemed the right time to let some of the physical coins go. Let other people look after them and enjoy having them.  You're also a real estate investor. At this point, do you think it’s better for people to invest in bitcoin or physical property?  I think it’s a mixture of the two. Bitcoin is high-risk, but potentially it has very high returns. And property is a hedge. It's a safety net. It's also very hard to steal, whereas bitcoins can be very easy to steal.  If I was still in my 20s, then I'd probably be keeping a much higher percentage in crypto, but nowadays I like the security of having a bunch of properties and enjoy renovating them.  Are you interested in other digital assets?  In the past I pretty much have been. I was the largest holder of litecoin {{LTC}} when it was a few cents. I think I had roughly 600,000. It was the first altcoin, and was quite controversial with Bitcoin Maximalists. They disliked it intensely because they thought it withdrew funds and interest away from Bitcoin. But I was quite convinced from the first time I saw it, it's impossible for anything to exist without its opposite.  And so that paid out very well. After Litecoin, I moved into Dash and was the largest holder of those and helped develop the project in some ways. And then I kind of lost interest and moved onto other things. I was highly recommended Ethereum at a Dutch conference and participated in the ICO. I got 100 bitcoins worth, which was 210,000 ether {{ETH}}. Unfortunately, I sold those way too soon. I made 100% or 200% profit, but I sold them for something like $2. So I will rue the potential $800 million there. Otherwise I'm pretty much fully bitcoin nowadays.  The way you discussed bitcoin earlier in the conversation you discussed it mostly as a method of transaction. Are you convinced by the arguments that it has properties like gold?  I think it is excellent as an investment. I think that's its main use at the moment. It’s perhaps the best performing investment in history, and it continues to grow. It is a trillion dollar asset class, and a great way to store value. Satoshi viewed it in the beginning as a hedge against the degenerate behavior of central governments and banks abusing the currencies that we will have to use every day. It's much more versatile than gold, in that it can be transferred pretty much anywhere around the world from anyone to anyone, instantly, with no armored trucks or anything and next to no fees. It's quite miraculous really, that it's come into existence. It's still very early days, but it really has transformed the world in many many ways.  What have been your biggest purchases made with crypto?  I must admit I've done very little with buying and selling with crypto. I go from fiat currency into crypto and then back out to fiat currency.  Capital gains taxes make spending crypto sort of annoying, to some extent.  For many people it would, yes. I'm fortunate that I am based in a tax haven where there isn't any capital gains tax. I make sure that I'm physically there when I cash any out. So I don't have that issue. There's also no income tax.  You mentioned you have a home in California. How do you balance the tax situation there, where state tax authorities may want to charge you income tax?  I’ve got homes in many countries around the world; it doesn't mean I'm suddenly a tax resident. I make sure I count my days very carefully – I don’t overstay. As long as I'm not here for more than six months of the year, I won't be liable for any tax. And I don't do any business here.  Do you mind if I ask what tax haven?  It’s a little island in the British Channel Islands called Sark. It’s a three square mile island and fairly unique in the world for having next to no tax. You just pay a small proportion of your property tax as a contribution to the kind of upkeep of the island. The main thing about it that's attractive is you don't have to keep records of what you're doing, which would have been hugely complicated when I was converting altcoins into bitcoin and then into other alternative currencies and then back into dollars. I pity the people who had to try and keep these records and then present them to a tax authority – it must be a nightmare.  Did you give up your passport?  No, I still keep a U.K. passport. I could trade it in for a Guernsey passport, which is the main island in the channel. It's really just a clone of the U.K.. It has all the same benefits, but I haven't bothered to do it. It doesn't really matter what nationality I have. It really only matters where I'm a fiscal resident.  How would you describe your political views?  Well, like many people, with age I probably have become a little more conservative in some ways. But I'm pretty much a capitalist; I believe that's a good way for people to behave. I'm not overtly political. I was probably quite anarchist in the past. I just adapt to whatever the majority believes. I am not trying to change things myself in a big way – I’m pretty apolitical.  Is there anything more you want to say about the possible theft of those Casascius coins?  I believe it was 55 bitcoins in value, something like $3.5 million at present value. At the time they were lost or taken they were only worth about $13,000. Still a lot but nothing compared to right now. So I'm very happy to offer a half a million dollar reward for their return. And unconditionally, I wouldn't want to press charges if someone decided to give them back to me.  See also: Spot Bitcoin ETFs: What You Need to Know  One day, I expect they'll turn up unless they've gone on a destructive route somehow. Everyone can see the addresses; I was really surprised when I checked a couple of weeks ago that they had never been moved and that they hadn't been peeled. So they're probably out there somewhere.  Last question, what are you looking forward to at Consensus?  Well, meeting Bobby Lee and Charlie Lee again. They both in their own ways have been very instrumental in helping me with my crypto journey. Charlie Lee by inventing Litecoin, where I did extremely well – probably even better than I did with bitcoin. And Bobby Lee for having BTCC (also known as BTCChina) and the physical coins. He produced physical coins just like Mike's Casascius coins. I have still got all my BTCC coins. That will be a future auction.  I've had quite a few adventures with the physical coins. I had to physically go to Shanghai to pick them up, as they couldn't be shipped at the time. That was an adventure in itself.  There's other people that I know from forums and interacting with on the internet who I'm sure it would be nice to see again in person if I've met them at other conferences. It's a chance to put people together and exchange ideas that if one just sat behind a computer at home, perhaps wouldn't happen.  So I'm looking forward to it. It's quite exciting. It's my first visit to Texas.",NEUTRAL,BTC | LTC,BTC | BUSINESS | LTC | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/15/crypto-old-head-otoh-talks-casascius-bitcoins-tax-havens-and-old-friends,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a9a51857231806a82ee4c459244903be2b2ddb04-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The utility token is set to back Subsquid's network of independent node operators, whose collective computing power parses reams of on-chain data. In January Subsquid sold $6.3 million worth of tokens to the public through CoinList, per a press release.  That brings the project's lifetime fundraise to $17.5 million across multiple funding rounds featuring Blockchange, Hypersphere, Zee Prime, DFG, and Lattice, the release said.  Subsquid is one of a handful of teams indexing on-chain activity to make that data useful for blockchain developers. It started in the Polkadot sector but has since branched into the Ethereum world and recently rolled out a beta for Solana as well.  CEO Dmitry Zhelezov said Subsquid's clients include academic researchers and analysts. Most, however, are developers who use the tool to see what's happening on their smart contracts, the on-chain engines behind NFT exchanges and Perps DEXes.  In an interview with Coindesk, Fohrmann said Subquid knew early on that it needed a token in order to ""incentivize people to run these nodes, to participate in this network"" of data indexing. It took a few years for the project to get there, though.  The SQD token launch is ""99% confirmed for Friday,"" Fohrmann added, but that date could get bumped to next week or the week after. Timing depends on ""one big exchange"" that has another token launch scheduled for Thursday, he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | ETH | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/05/15/data-indexer-subsquid-plans-to-launch-sqd-token-friday,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/745481dfe8bdfe9e0c722b3fc1592ddec2735a12-4608x2592.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company's operating business is immaterial compared to its bitcoin holdings, and it has a history of missing revenue targets. The stock trades at up to a valuation of $100K per bitcoin, making it more advantageous to buy bitcoin directly. MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ) has turned from a legitimate data software story to a nearly pure bitcoin investment with extra risk. Now, the prime reason to buy this stock is to obtain access to cryptocurrency at a discount, but this isn't the case after MircroStrategy has surged to $1,250. My investment thesis is Bearish on the stock following the big jump this year in excess of bitcoin prices. Source: Finviz Immaterial Operating Business MicroStrategy originally started down the path as a business intelligence software company supporting bitcoin purchases. Now, the bitcoin valuation is far in excess of the operating business, a business that only produces a small non-GAAP operating profit. The company reported Q1'24 revenues of $115 million, with a small operating profit on a 5.5% decline in revenues. In essence, the operating business is mostly immaterial to the bitcoin investment. In addition, the business took a $192 million digital impairment charge. In essence, the company is worth less due to the costs of running the business. The management team attempts to build a subscription business, but MicroStrategy has generally reported a trend of lower revenues the last decade. Data by YCharts Analysts generally forecast revenue growth for the year ahead, but MicroStrategy just missed Q1'24 estimates by over $6 million. The company has a history of missing targets, including nearly $8 million in the prior quarter. Investors can't assume the business intelligence business grows revenue to $495 million this year, with a forecasted growth of 4% in 2025 to reach $517 million. All About Bitcoin The stock has a market cap of nearly $22 billion, while the bitcoin valuation was just $15 billion at the end of March. MicroStrategy owned 214,278 bitcoin at the end of the quarter when prices were at $71,028 each. Source: MicroStrategy Q1'24 presentation During the quarter, MicroStrategy raised $1.5 billion via convertible debt offerings. The company purchased 25,250 bitcoins during the quarter to reach a total of 214,400 with an average purchase price of $35,180 per bitcoin. The price of bitcoin has only fallen since the end of the quarter. The current price is just below $63K, or down over $8K per bitcoin since the end of March. MicroStrategy only owns $13.5 billion worth of bitcoin now. Source: Coindesk An investor is paying over $7 billion for the operating business with limited value over $1-2 billion, if that high. An investor wanting bitcoin would naturally want to own the digital currency at the current price, while an investor is paying the equivalent of nearly $100K per bitcoin in order for MicroStrategy to manage the digital currency. Even worse, the company holds $3.6 billion in debt to accumulate the bitcoins over time. The enterprise value is much closer to $25.5 billion for $13.5 billion in bitcoin assets and an operating business with a small operating profit. While the company spends a long time discussing the benefits of buying bitcoin with leverage to create long-term value, an investor has no reason to buy MicroStrategy over buying the digital currency directly. An investor is in essence buying a bitcoin trader constantly raising capital via debt and equity with the share value based on the sentiment of investors as much as the price of bitcoin. An investor can just buy bitcoin directly and benefit off the actual prices. MicroStrategy is likely to see a much bigger dip on lower bitcoin prices. During the last bitcoin plunge in 2021, the stock fell 89% from the peak on February 9, 2021 to the end of 2022. Bitcoin slumped from basically $65K to $15K during the period for a 77% hit Data by YCharts MicroStrategy would only make sense as an investment as a play to acquire bitcoin below market value due to the confusing corporate structure. Instead, investors are actually assigning a vastly higher valuation to the business than the bitcoin owned. Investors have already felt the pain of overpaying for the assets owned, with the stock falling from nearly $2,000 to the current price of $1,245 despite just a minimal dip in bitcoin. Takeaway The key investor takeaway is that MicroStrategy isn't priced correctly for the assets held by the company. The stock is valued far in excess of the price of bitcoin, making any investment in MicroStrategy at this price unappealing. An investor interested in bitcoin should just buy the digital currency directly at a better price.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4693423-microstrategy-stretched-bitcoin-bet?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/27849404.jpeg

The analyst suggested that a drop to this price level may not be bad for Bitcoin and could instead be necessary for it to finally make that price rally. $57,938 Is The Price Level To Keep An Eye On CryptoCon mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that $57,938 is the “new price to watch for the 20-week EMA (Exponential Moving Average).” He noted that such a price drop might be necessary, stating that “boredom and sideways price action allow room for growth.” Based on his analysis, any potential price decline that Bitcoin experiences is a healthy correction and shouldn’t be considered a bearish reversal. Related Reading: Dogecoin Derivatives Volume Jumps 111% As Open Interest Spikes, But What About Price? Meanwhile, Bitcoin is showing impressive strength on the charts, with CryptoCon stating that the flagship crypto “continues to hold the 20-week EMA as support while visiting the almost absolute bottom of the cycle 4 DMI support zone.” CryptoCon’s positive outlook for Bitcoin provides assurance that a parabolic move is still on the horizon. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital also recently shared a positive outlook for Bitcoin. He revealed that Bitcoin was out of the “Danger Zone,” suggesting that the flagship crypto was primed for a move to the upside. The analyst also remarked that Bitcoin was running out of unremarkable months before it began its parabolic phase. Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto hinted that Bitcoin was already showing signs of this imminent parabolic phase. In an X post, he mentioned that Bitcoin was displaying a cup and handle reversal pattern on the weekly chart and that the “breakout will be explosive and will send it to a cycle top.” While agreeing with Mikybull Crypto’s analysis, Crypto analyst BitQuant mentioned that $95,000 will be “achieved in one move, and that is quite obvious.” He, however, noted that it remains uncertain when this move will happen and called for patience as everyone waits for Bitcoin “to perform as expected.” BitQuant further advised that it might be better to leave the market for those who can’t “avoid the torture,” claiming that there “will be a lot of pain for those with weak nerves” in the coming months. Based on Arthur Hayes’s prediction, investors might have to wait until August for that big move from the flagship crypto. Bitcoin Is Still Far From Its Market Top In a recent X post, Rekt Capital suggested that Bitcoin was still far from its market top. He highlighted past cycles, which show that the bull market peak usually occurs between 518 and 546 days after the halving. Based on this, the analyst predicts that the flagship crypto will likely peak in September or October 2025. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Volume Flips Dogecoin, Will SHIB Price Flip DOGE If This Analyst’s Prediction Comes True?

Dog-themed floki (FLOKI) zoomed 12%, the highest among the top 50 tokens by market capitalization, while pepe (PEPE) jumped 5% to a new lifetime peak.  Meme tokens started to rally earlier in the week after Keith Gill's first X post since 2021 boosted risk-taking sentiment among traders. Gill is a retail trader whose online persona and investment strategies contributed to a short squeeze on video-game retailer GameStop's stock in 2021.  A mere picture posted by Gill sent the stock skywards, nearly doubling in value on Monday despite multiple trading halts, even though he did not directly mention the company. The rally showed signs of slowing, however. The stocks is down 13% in pre-market trading on Wednesday.  Some traders expected his influence to cause rallies in meme stocks and tokens, as reported.

42408246,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaBamv,1715774437,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Approaches $63K Ahead of U.S. CPI Data,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin made some cautious gains on Wednesday ahead of the latest inflation data from the U.S. BTC is priced at $62,775 at the time of writing, up 1.8% in 24 hours. The wider digital market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), also ticked up, adding 0.55%. April's U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data is due at 08:30 ET, with expectations that it will show a 3.4% year-on-year increase, slower than March's 3.5%. Some analysts expect a softer-than-expected CPI reading could lift bitcoin above $65,000.  Latest News: U.S. CPI Softer Than Expected at 0.3% in April; Bitcoin Rises to $63.7K  Bitcoin's mean transaction fee has reversed the post-halving spike, squeezing miners' revenue. Miners earn revenue from two sources: block rewards and transaction fees. Miners receive a fixed amount of BTC as a reward for adding new blocks, along with transaction fees for including transactions in the blocks they mine. The spike, driven by the new Runes protocol, helped to compensate for the block reward being cut in half, but this proved to be short-lived. In response, miners may liquidate around $5 billion worth of BTC in the coming months, according to Markus Thielen, head of 10x Research. ""Why would they keep inventory when the price is not going up?"" Thielen said.  Broker Canaccord Genuity expects Galaxy Digital's positive momentum to continue after the crypto financial services firm reported an increase in net income of 40% on Tuesday. Galaxy saw an increase in the number of trading counterparties with trading revenue rising 79%, Canaccord noted in a report, citing the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. as the major catalyst. Mike Novogratz’s firm also increased its proprietary mining hashrate and the Helios facility “presents an opportunity for Galaxy to pursue both mining and AI hosting over time,” the broker said. Galaxy's Toronto-listed shares fell 1.12% on Tuesday to close at C$12.41.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows that a record 55% of respondents in Bank of America's latest survey of global fund managers with $562 billion in assets under management see global fiscal policy as ""too stimulative.""  The increased government spending, though positive for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, could eventually add to inflationary pressures.  Over 40% of fund managers see inflation as the top-tail risk.

27845399,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608145,1715774403,Crypto Analyst Shares Top AI Altcoin Investments This Month,"In an analysis of the current landscape at the nexus of artificial intelligence and altcoins, crypto analyst Prithvir (@Prithvir12) recently shared insights via X that highlight both the opportunities and pitfalls in the AI coin market this month. His analysis covers upcoming AI catalysts, their impact on specific tokens, and personal investment recommendations, shedding light on the nuanced strategies required in this volatile segment. In-Depth Look At The AI Crypto Market Prithvir underlines a series of significant events in the AI space that are anticipated to directly impact the crypto markets. He first points to NVIDIA’s earnings announcement scheduled for May 22nd, emphasizing NVIDIA’s pivotal role in AI technology, which could have cascading effects on AI-centric cryptocurrencies. Further stirring the market is the buzz around OpenAI’s GPT-4oT. Moreover, Prithvir discusses the influence of major tech conferences focused on AI advancements, notably Google’s I/O conference and Apple’s emphasis on AI at its upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). He predicts these events are poised to introduce new AI initiatives that could impact crypto markets. Related Reading: This Crypto Expert Called The Bitcoin Top in 2021, Now He’s Calling The Bottom In 2024 In his post, Prithvir also analyzes several tokens that have responded differently to these AI catalysts. He describes WLD, associated with OpenAI through Sam Altman, which experienced a 20% drop in price last week, a typical “sell the news” reaction post the GPT-4o announcement. He expresses concerns about WLD’s “ridiculous tokenomics” and the risks posed by potential coordinated short squeezes, advising traders to approach with caution. Prithvir also touches upon OLAS, which, despite losing some visibility since its peak in 2023, remains active on the Gnosis chain and could be poised for a comeback depending on market conditions and developments within its platform, according to the analyst. The token SPEC, however, has shown significant volatility, skyrocketing from $5 to $15 and then retracting to $8 within two weeks. Prithvir critiques its high fully diluted valuation (FDV) close to $1 billion, warning of the speculative nature and the inherent risks of engaging with such a volatile asset. Related Reading: Is The Crypto Winter Thawing? US Bitcoin ETFs Record First Inflows In Weeks – Coinshares Lastly, he addresses the group of ASI tokens FET, AGIX and OCEAN, representing the Super Intelligence Alliance, noting that their once-leading positions in AI-driven market rallies have dwindled. According to Prithvir, these tokens are currently overvalued, with limited upside potential, indicating a saturated market state for these assets. Prithvir’s Top Altcoin Picks Navigating through the complexities of the AI coin market, Prithvir shares his preferred investment strategies and picks. He highlights Render (RNDR) as a favorable choice, especially leading up to NVIDIA’s earnings and Apple’s WWDC, due to its direct ties to their technologies and expected feature enhancements which might boost its value. “NVIDIA due to comparisons of GPU networks and Apple due to the rendering software they have built that Apple always features at different keynotes. Hence, I think this could be a good swing trade leading up to WWDC Time period – 3 weeks,” the analyst stated. AR is Prithvir’s “biggest AI coin holding currently.” The project is praised by him for its pivot to AI functionalities with the AO Computer and robust team. The presence of AR on Tier-1 exchanges and its substantial backing makes it a “no-brainer” for a medium-term hold. He also mentions NEAR, albeit with a smaller investment footprint due to the perceived limited upside. “Smaller position than AR due to more limited upside. But could become one of the consensus AI trades of this cycle due to its brand value, good liquidity and innovations in other sectors such as Chain Abstraction,” Prithvir wrote via X. At press time, RNDR traded at $10.1089.

The dollar index drops ahead of the pivotal U.S. CPI release.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} chalked out modest gains Wednesday, chewing through selling pressure over Binance as the dollar index (DXY) tumbled ahead of the pivotal U.S. April inflation data.  CoinDesk data shows that the leading cryptocurrency by market value rose 2% to $62,800, nearly reversing Tuesday’s decline.  According to data tracking tool The Kingfisher, the bullish order flow came from the Nasdaq-listed Coinbase exchange and Bitfinex, helping the market absorb ‘taker selling’ over Binance. A taker order is placed by a trader who looks to execute the trade immediately at the going market price.  The spot cumulative volume delta over Coinbase and Bitfinex rose, indicating an increase in net buying pressure, while the CVD on Binance declined, indicating steady selling.  CVD measures the net difference between buying and selling volumes, highlighting whether the buyer or seller was the leader. The indicator includes trades with USD or USD equivalents as quote currencies, including both fiat and dollar-pegged stablecoins.  “Binance Spot taker selling still occurring, so far it's being matched by passive spot bid. Coinbase spot seeing some renewed taker bid, batches of spot being bought,” pseudonymous analyst Skew said on X.  In traditional markets, traders continue to sell the U.S. dollar against major fiat currencies, supporting gains in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  According to data source TradingView, the dollar index, which measures the greenback’s exchange rate against a basket of fiat currencies, fell 0.17% to 104.84, signaling a continuation of the decline from the May 1 high of 106.49.  The weakness followed comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell that the current monetary policy is restrictive by many measures and the next move is unlikely to be a rate hike (or additional liquidity tightening).  Powell also downplayed the hotter-than-expected U.S. April producer price index figure, which signaled more inflation in the pipeline.  “I wouldn’t call it hot,” Powell said of the wholesale inflation data. “I would call it sort of mixed.”  The Labor Department is scheduled to publish the consumer price index (CPI) for April on Wednesday at 12:30 UTC. Analysts have said that a softer-than-expected print could lift BTC above $65,000.  The consensus is for the data to show the CPI increased 3.4% over the year in April, a moderation from March’s 3.5%. The core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 3.6% year-on-year, down from March’s 3.8%.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | BNB,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/15/bitcoin-gains-2-to-628k-as-bulls-chew-through-taker-selling,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9fac6abaeb1d834a15de53e36a72f6b43129042a-1679x1134.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Analyst Makes Bold Claim, But Can It Overcome Legal Hurdles?","A fresh prediction has ignited discussion in the XRP community. Analyst Cryptobilbuwoo is charting an ambitious course for the cryptocurrency, with a potential price target that has some investors excited and others skeptical. Related Reading: Bullish On Ethereum: Analyst Predicts Crypto’s Imminent Takeoff Echoes Of 2017: Fibonacci Paints A Bullish Picture Cryptobilbuwoo’s forecast draws inspiration from historical patterns, particularly the XRP rally of 2017. By leveraging Fibonacci retracement levels, a common technical analysis tool, they see a potentially similar scenario unfolding for the altcoin. Imagine a roadmap to the summit. Fibonacci levels act as checkpoints, highlighting potential resistance or support zones during a price rise. Cryptobilbuwoo suggests XRP could break through the $33 mark, aligning with the key Fib. 1.618 level. This would be a significant step forward, but the real climb comes next – a projected ascent to $589, based on the Fib. 2.382 level. A Lofty Target: Can XRP Reach The Top? However, there’s a significant hurdle to overcome. To reach $589, the coin would require a staggering price increase of over 100,000%. This ambitious target has many market analysts raising eyebrows. It’s a leap that some consider more akin to wishful thinking than a realistic market prediction. Other crypto market analysts present a contrasting view, suggesting XRP could even fall to zero. While this scenario seems extreme, it underscores the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $0.5004, down 1.4% and 4.2% in the daily and weekly timeframes, data from Coingecko shows. Meanwhile, in the XRP community, the $589 narrative used to be the main focus. The community’s excitement to see XRP at $589 is evident in the tweet below: It seems that most of the XRP community would hate to wake up tomorrow to a $589 XRP, as this would mean they could no longer accumulate it. But then again $589 is still cheap and actually nothing compared to what is actually coming! pic.twitter.com/hvySrx0RpY — Dr. Huber🔥🦅🔥 (@Leerzeit) May 7, 2024 Signs Of Optimism: Fueling The Ascent? Despite the skepticism surrounding the $589 target, there are positive signs for XRP. The coin has displayed resilience, consistently hovering above the psychologically important $0.50 level. Additionally, a trend of investors moving XRP off exchanges has emerged. This could indicate a more long-term bullish outlook and potentially reduce selling pressure. Related Reading: Pepe Power! Meme Coin Surges On Back Of GameStop Nostalgia Technically, Cryptobilbuwoo finds support for their prediction in XRP’s historical price charts. They point to a descending triangle pattern on the XRP/BTC chart, a formation that preceded XRP’s breakout in 2017. Could this be a sign of history repeating itself? The Verdict: A Measured Climb Or A Fall From Grace? The future for XRP likely lies somewhere between the extremes. The $589 target might be overly optimistic, but a measured upswing based on technical indicators and reduced selling pressure remains a possibility.

The approval of spot bitcoin ETFs was a catalyst for the increase in counterparty engagement.  The firm could pursue both mining and AI hosting over time, Canaccord said.  Galaxy Digital (GLXY) is evolving its business in a thoughtful and methodical way and, while the regulatory backdrop remains challenging, the company’s opportunity set and competitive positioning remains compelling, broker Canaccord Genuity said in a report on Tuesday after the crypto financial services firm published first-quarter results.  The Toronto-based company founded by CEO Mike Novogratz said net income rose 40% from the quarter before to $422 million, and the broker said it expects the positive momentum to continue.  “We are encouraged to see solid progress in growth and maturation in each of the company’s three operating units coming into view over the next few quarters,” analysts led by Joseph Vafi wrote.  Galaxy Trading grew its total number of counterparties to 1,161 in the first quarter from 1,052 in the fourth, and counterparty trading revenue rose 79% to $66 million, the report noted. The approval of spot bitcoin {{BTC}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January was behind the development.  “Spot bitcoin ETF approvals have been a major catalyst for the increase in counterparty engagement as some of the more traditional asset managers and hedge funds are entering/reentering the space,” the authors wrote.  GalaxyOne also saw further traction, with over 75 institutional clients and more than $1 billion of assets on the platform, the note said. “This is a great set of customers for the company to offer its full suite of products, including custody, lending, spot trading, hedging and derivatives.”  The asset-management business also enjoyed good momentum, ending the quarter with assets under management (AUM) of $7.8 billion, an increase of 50% on the previous quarter, Canaccord said.  “Galaxy continues to grow its infrastructure and GK8 business, growing its assets under stake by 100% quarter-on-quarter to $486m,” the report added. The firm bought self-custody platform GK8 for $44 million in February last year.  The firm also increased its proprietary mining hashrate and the Helios facility “presents an opportunity for Galaxy to pursue both mining and AI hosting over time,” the broker said. Canaccord has a buy rating on Galaxy shares with a C$17 price target. The stock closed at C$12.41 on Tuesday.

42408228,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaBaJA,1715767200,"Cahill Gordon & Reindel Beefs Up Crypto Practice, Adds 3 Crypto-Native Lawyers Including Lewis Cohen","International law firm Cahill Gordon & Reindel has added three crypto-native lawyers to its growing digital assets and emerging technology practice, in hopes it will become a one-stop shop for cryptocurrency companies looking for legal and regulatory advice.  Lewis Cohen, the co-founder of crypto-focused firm DLx Law, will join the firm as a partner and co-chair the expanded practice – which has been renamed CahillNXT – alongside former Southern District of New York (SDNY) prosecutor Samson “Sam” Enzer. Two other lawyers from DLx Law – Delaware-based Gregory Strong and New York-based Sarah Chen – will join Cohen as partners in Cahill’s newly expanded practice.  One of Wall Street’s go-to law firms, Cahill’s continued expansion into the crypto sphere is significant, indicating a growing need for crypto legal advice among traditional finance companies.  “When I was a kid, the [Chicago] Bulls were the leading team in the NBA,” Enzer said, “That’s what this is – this is the crypto legal Dream Team.”  Enzer, a former senior member of the SDNY’s Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force, joined Cahill in November 2021 and subsequently established the firm’s digital assets practice. The practice has a number of high profile clients, including notorious Bitfinex launderer Ilya “Dutch” Lichtenstein, and major crypto companies like Coinbase.  But Enzer said that his expertise is in dispute resolution, including litigation and handling government enforcement actions – but when he needed expert advice on regulatory issues, he found himself regularly turning to Cohen and his team for help.  “We worked together for years,” Enzer said. “With the explosive demand for our services, and the burgeoning demand for the specific advice that Lewis [Cohen] and his team offer, we thought it made sense to combine.”  That combination, Enzer and Cohen hope, will make seeking comprehensive crypto legal advice easier for current and future clients.  “One of the big frustrations for clients is that they don’t really have a one-stop shop that they can go to to find crypto-native lawyers who speak the language, understand the technology,” Enzer said. “What you have is a tax crypto expert here, a crypto litigator there, a securities crypto expert at this place – it makes it very difficult for clients and more expensive, frankly, because they end up having to retain multiple law firms to get what they need.”  Crypto-native knowledge  In addition to making things easier on their clients, Cohen and Enzer both stressed the value that having more crypto-native lawyers on Cahill’s staff will bring.  “We just see far too many lawyers struggle with what is a multi-sig, what is a roll-up, how does a bridge work? All of these things that, if you’re going to give legal advice, you have to understand,” Cohen said. “Part of our mission here is educational. We very much believe in the open source blockchain ethos and we really want to bring that DNA into our practice.”  Enzer said that a non-lawyer computer programmer from DLx Law will also join CahillNXT as a consultant, which he said will help Cahill and its clients “bridge the gap between computer code and the law.”  “Many big firms who dabble in this space do not speak the language, do not understand the tech, and therefore miss the opportunities to make the best arguments for their clients,” Enzer said. “If you don’t understand that, then you can’t really help clients navigate the maze of regulations”  Cohen has been a prominent member of the crypto legal community for years.

27839523,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608127,1715766754,Notcoin: Stake BNB and FDUSD to Farm $NOT Tokens,"Notcoin, a viral Telegram-based game, has successfully onboarded millions of users into the world of Web3. This straightforward gameplay resonated with users, leading to a peak of six million daily active users and a total player base of 35 million. This article delves into what Notcoin is, how it works, and the exciting opportunities it offers, including staking BNB and FDUSD to farm Notcoin tokens ($NOT). In Notcoin, players earn in-game currency by tapping on a gold coin within the Telegram app. The energy required to tap the coin depletes and refills over time, preventing continuous gameplay without breaks. Players can invite friends to join the game, enhancing their experience and potentially increasing their earnings. The game features a global leaderboard, divided into tiers from Silver to Diamond, where players can see how they rank against others worldwide. Boosts and Power-ups To increase their earning potential, players can use various boosts or power-ups. These include daily refreshable boosts like “Full Energy” and “Turbo” boosts, as well as permanent boosts purchasable with Notcoin. These power-ups allow players to earn more coins per tap and extend their energy capacity. An Auto-Tap bot is also available, collecting coins on behalf of the player even when they are not actively playing. Cosmetic Upgrades Players can spend their earned Notcoin on cosmetic upgrades, changing the appearance of the game’s background or the coin they are tapping. These customizations add a fun and personalized element to the game. The NOT Token The excitement around Notcoin isn’t just about the game itself but also the upcoming launch of the $NOT token. The NOT token will be listed on The Open Network (TON), which was originally founded by Telegram. The total supply of $NOT is 102,719,221,714, with the entire supply expected to be in circulation upon listing. Token Distribution and Fairness One of the unique aspects of Notcoin is its approach to token distribution. All $NOT tokens will be awarded to players who earned Notcoin through the tap-to-earn game. This method ensures a fair distribution, avoiding the creation of early whales typically seen in other cryptocurrency projects. While 100% circulation upon listing is planned, not all tokens will immediately enter trading, as some may remain unclaimed or locked in allocations. Ecosystem Contributions Notcoin encourages community participation and contribution. Players can earn $NOT by exploring Web3 products, playing new games, and adding value to the ecosystem. Additionally, Web3 builders can offer their products to the community through Notcoin campaigns, fostering a collaborative and growth-oriented environment. Staking BNB and FDUSD to Farm $NOT Binance has announced the listing of $NOT on its platform, providing users with the opportunity to stake BNB and FDUSD to farm Notcoin tokens. This initiative is part of Binance’s 54th Launchpool project, allowing users to earn rewards by participating in the staking pools. Staking Details Farming Period : 2024-05-13 00:00 (UTC) to 2024-05-15 23:59 (UTC) Listing Date : 2024-05-16 12:00 (UTC) Trading Pairs : NOT/BTC, NOT/USDT, NOT/BNB, NOT/FDUSD, and NOT/TRY Staking Pools and Rewards Stake BNB : 2,619,340,153 NOT in rewards (85%) Stake FDUSD : 462,236,497 NOT in rewards (15%) Users can stake their BNB and FDUSD into separate pools to farm NOT tokens over three days. The webpage for staking will be available 24 hours before the Launchpool starts. To participate in the Notcoin airdrop and staking, visit Binance and stake your BNB or FDUSD. Remember to do your research and ensure the safety of your funds. Regster on Binance Project Announcement : Notcoin on Binance Launchpool Binance Research : Notcoin Project Binance Megadrop In addition to staking BNB and FDUSD to earn $NOT tokens, users can also participate in Binance’s new Megadrop concept. The Binance Megadrop is designed to reward loyal BNB stakers with tokens from future projects listed on Binance Launchpool. By staking BNB for extended periods, preferably 120+ days, users enhance their eligibility for these airdrops, gaining early access to promising new tokens and maximizing their potential rewards. Lockup Duration (Days) BNB Staked Score 30 1 BNB 100 60 1 BNB 110 90 1 BNB 120 120 1 BNB 130 What is Binance Megadrop? The Binance Megadrop allows users to stake BNB for extended periods to increase their chances of receiving airdrops from future projects. This innovative concept is aimed at rewarding loyal Binance users and providing them with early access to new tokens. Increasing Your Chances with Binance Megadrop By staking BNB, users not only earn $NOT tokens but also increase their chances in the Binance Megadrop. This approach allows users to benefit from both immediate rewards and long-term potential through future airdrops. Personal Opinions and Predictions Given the innovative nature of Notcoin and its fair distribution model, the $NOT token has significant potential. The project’s engagement strategy and large user base provide a solid foundation for future growth. Binance will be the first platform to list the $NOT token, with trading starting on May 16, 2024. Players who earned Notcoin in the game will receive an airdrop of the real $NOT token, creating an exciting bridge between the virtual and real-world value. Pre-market Vouchers Before the airdrop, Notcoin introduced an NFT voucher program, allowing players with over 10 million Notcoin to convert their earnings into NFT vouchers. These vouchers can be bought, sold, or traded before the $NOT token launch, providing a speculative market for early adopters. The Future of Notcoin With the mining phase of the game ending on April 1, Notcoin is poised for a significant evolution. The game will return after the token launch with new gameplay mechanics and reduced rewards. Companies looking to gain exposure to Notcoin’s large audience will need to buy $NOT on the open market and use it to activate features within the game. Potential Additions and Changes Open Builders, the creators of Notcoin, plan to enhance the game with additional features, such as a trading bot for buying and selling crypto tokens via Telegram. The goal is to create a more visual and user-friendly interface compared to existing text-based trading bots. Community and Ecosystem Growth Notcoin’s model emphasizes community involvement and ecosystem growth. By allowing users to earn $NOT through various activities and encouraging Web3 builders to engage with the community, Notcoin aims to create a vibrant and sustainable ecosystem. Opinions and Predictions Given the innovative nature of Notcoin and its fair distribution model, the $NOT token has significant potential. The project’s engagement strategy and large user base provide a solid foundation for future growth.

The problem stemmed from issues with its rollup provider.  Degen Chain, an Ethereum layer-3 blockchain dedicated to meme coins, is back online after a two-day outage.  The chain had been unusable since it effectively shut down at 20:15 UTC on May 12. For over 50 hours, it failed to validate transactions or produce new blocks.  The protocol relies on Conduit, a rollup infrastructure platform, for its technical framework and operational support, particularly for managing transactions and data availability.  Rollups process transactions off-chain, then bundle and submit them to Ethereum, increasing speed and reducing costs. By using Conduit, Degen Chain can function as a layer-3 blockchain, allowing it to handle high transaction volumes.  On May 14, Degen Chain announced it was working with Conduit to resolve the downtime, which Conduit attributed to a ""custom config change"" that halted block production for Degen Chain.  Degen Chain launched earlier this year and quickly hit $100 million in trading volume thanks to the current meme coin craze.  According to DefiLlama, the chain has a market cap of just under $200 million and a total locked value of $2.17 million.

The overwhelming majority of Coinbase's Q1 volume came from institutional traders rather than retail. As BTC matures as an asset, it will behoove investors to remain cognizant of key differences in the macro setup this cycle. The first half of 2024 was one that was jam-packed with positive catalysts for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). Spot ETF approvals have generated over 200k BTC of positive net flow into those ETFs in just a few months - nearly $13 billion in dollar-denominated investment capital. The halving in mid-April has added a supply crunch element to Bitcoin that theoretically puts upside pressure on the coin's price if demand for BTC remains constant. With each of these catalysts now in the rearview mirror, the question at this point is what drives demand for BTC going forward? Bitcoin Holder Data Between Seeking Alpha and my personal blog, I've spent the last several weeks sharing my thinking on Bitcoin's fundamental setup, pricing indicators, and the very concept of what the network actually is. In summary, I don't think Bitcoin has lived up to the creator's original intention as a medium of exchange. Furthermore, the Lightning Network has generally failed to scale Bitcoin to the degree many believed that it would - myself included, for what it's worth. When looking at Bitcoin's utility as a peer to peer payment network, we can observe a network that that is currently showing a diminishing number of regular users: 30 Day Avg Active Addresses (CoinMetrics) On May 13th, 30-day average active addresses fell below 730k for the first time in over four years. However, what I view as clear shortcomings don't necessarily undermine the entire investment case for BTC today. As a fixed-supply asset that exists natively on a decentralized, global ledger system, Bitcoin is still an incredibly interesting concept and one that I think justifies some exposure in what is increasingly appearing to be fiscal dominance in the United States. It could be argued that Bitcoin is as much a product as it is an investment. If we equate BTC to be something resembling an insurance policy on the fiat system, then things like inflation, interest rates, and long-term holder trends likely serve as important data points. HODLer Balance (IntoTheBlock) In the chart above, we can see Bitcoin's ""hodler balance"" as calculated by IntoTheBlock. There are a couple of different ways ""hodler"" can be defined, but this particular measurement quantifies the BTC that has been held by addresses for at least a year. As each cycle progresses, the longer-term holders have typically amassed more coins, sold into rallies, and started rebuying after the cycle top. As of mid-May 2024, the hodler balance is 13 million coins - or 66% of Bitcoin's 19.7 million circulating supply. While this hodler control of supply is enormous, it's actually down about 6% from the most recent all-time high of 13.8 million BTC in January. HODLer Supply BTC Price December 2016 9.5 $800 March 2018 6.9 $9,600 September 2020 11.8 $10,900 October 2021 10 $62,500 January 2024 13.8 $44,900 Source: IntoTheBlock, supply figures in millions A similar dip in hodler supply to what has been observed this year took place between late May and early December 2019 around the time the price of Bitcoin retraced from $11.3k down to $7.3k. This was shortly before the coin totally bottomed out a few months later at the beginning of COVID. Differences in Demand Between The Cycles FRED The response to COVID had a not-so insignificant impact on Bitcoin's price. At that time, interest rates were at the floor and the government was heavily stimulating - to the point where it was indiscriminately showering the populace with direct cash deposits. With minimal options for travel and entertainment, much of that stimulus money piled into risk assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. We do not have the same setup today. year over year change (FRED) In fact, consumer price inflation has turned out to be far stickier than was initially forecasted by many of the economists at the Federal Reserve. I suspect this sticky inflation will change how retail buyers engage with assets like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies this time around. I would posit that many of the retail consumers who participated in the last Bitcoin price run simply aren't going to do so now because they need the money to pay for essentials. There are clear signals of consumer distress coming from companies like Starbucks ( SBUX ) and McDonald's ( MCD ) that Bret Jensen covered earlier this week: Right now, I believe the average American consumer has a better handle on the U.S. economy than the average investor and a better take on the true level of inflation than governmental statistics. I agree with this and also Jensen's thoughts on market complacency. Additionally, it seems to me that demand for BTC is coming more from the institutional buyers than the retail buyers at this stage of the bull market. Consider the breakout between Coinbase's ( COIN ) retail and institutional business in Q1-24: Coinbase Volume Breakout (The Block) In the first quarter of the year, Coinbase's retail volume came in at $56 billion. This was both a sequential and year over year improvement, but still well behind the level of retail volume Coinbase was doing when Bitcoin last peaked in Q4-21. Coinbase Volume Q4-21 Q1-24 Change Retail $177 $56 -68.4% Institutional $371 $256 -31.0% Source: The Block, author's calculations, dollars in billions Institutional volume was off 31% from the level during Bitcoin's previous cycle peak. In the same quarter, retail volume did less than a third of what it did in the fourth quarter of 2021. The signal here is that, at least in the US market, the bid is mainly coming through products like ETFs. Which means BTC could behave a bit more like a more traditional investment asset than it likely has in past cycles. Pearson Correlation (The Block) Consider Bitcoin's correlation with stocks has generally been high for much of the last four months with about a three-week exception in April. In my view, any broad weakness in the financial markets will likely bring Bitcoin down with stocks. ProShares Bitcoin Strategy Underperforms Despite my short-term caution regarding BTC, I do still have a considerable amount of exposure to Bitcoin and Bitcoin proxies. One ticker that I'm still not holding is the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ). It's possibly easy to be swayed over to BITO given the fund's dividend payment and low-ish 0.95% expense ratio compared to a fund like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ). But in the time since the approval of spot ETFs in the United States, BITO is underperforming the spot funds: Data by YCharts BITO's total return since January 11th 2024 is 33.5%. This is admittedly a tremendous gain in just 4 months, but BITO is trailing the spot funds by nearly 2 full percentage points. We can see in the chart above the spot ETFs have a very tight total return range and BITO is obviously the laggard. This is largely due to the constant rollover of contracts from month to month. It is highly likely that rollover expense will be a compounding problem over time. Until a potential future where Coinbase is forced to raise custodial fees on the ETF managers to combat retail volume decay, the spot ETFs are the better way to play Bitcoin in an investment account. Closing Thoughts In my opinion, Bitcoin bulls can be patient and pick their spots to add to core positions. Crypto is quickly becoming a political issue in the United States, and I suspect asset managers may want more clarity on what the regulatory environment is going to look like in 2025 before adding too much more exposure to Bitcoin or any of the other ""blue chip"" digital assets in the market. Most of the demand for BTC is coming from institutions rather than retail buyers. The latter of which are tapped out, levered up, and increasingly working multiple jobs to make ends meet. That's necessarily a great recipe for Bitcoin demand. I'm very optimistic that we'll inevitably see a six-figure BTC price. But I think it's going to take a little bit longer than some may be expecting.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4693369-bito-sell-in-may-and-go-away?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/27839174.jpeg

The exploiters used a ""donation"" attack to manipulate markets. The incident occurred on the Optimism blockchain version; the Base blockchain version was unaffected.  The exploit happened after the protocol added token markets for Velodrome Finance's VELO. The attacker took advantage of a two-day timelock to execute four transactions, creating markets and adding collateral factors.  Sonne Finance's SONNE token slumped after the developers acknowledged a hack that drained $20 million from the decentralized lending protocol early Wednesday.  SONNE slid 60% to 2.5 cents, its lowest level in over a year, cutting market cap to $20 million even after the developers said they were able to stop $6.5 million being siphoned off once they realized the attack was happening.  The exploiters utilized a “donation” attack to manipulate certain markets offered by the platform, stealing various tokens before being interrupted. The incident occurred on Sonne’s platform on the Optimism blockchain. The Base blockchain version was not affected. (Think of this as a mobile application getting hacked on Apple iOS, but remaining safe on Android.)  How the Exploit Happened  The exploit occurred after the protocol added token markets for Velodrome Finance’s VELO following a recent community proposal. The attacker took advantage of a two-day timelock to execute four transactions, which included creating markets and adding collateral factors.  A timelock contract is a smart contract embedded in a blockchain that executes a transaction at a specific time, in this case, two days after it was locked.  The attacker executed transactions by donating large amounts of cryptocurrency to manipulate the exchange rate between two tokens. That effectively tricked the platform into believing it had more collateral than was really available.  Blockchain data shows the attacker managed to transfer millions of VELO, ether, and USD Coin (USDC) following the manipulation. They later converted this to $8 million in bitcoin and ether and transferred the funds to a new wallet address in early European hours.  The protocol had previously avoided similar issues by adding markets with zero collateral factors, manually adding collateral, and permanently removing it before anyone was able to manipulate the market.  In a report on the exploit, the developers said they were working on retrieving the stolen funds and floated a bounty for the hacker.",NEGATIVE,USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | USDC,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/05/15/sonne-finance-token-drops-60-after-20m-exploit-on-optimism,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c8e0c7749afacc68b95131f116f3c7f4f4cbbf91-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

IBIT offers a straightforward, efficient, and safe method for accessing Bitcoin, with ease of use, safety, and simplicity. Self-custody of Bitcoin is only preferable for individuals looking to explore the crypto space or avoid government oversight. Self-custody of Bitcoin entails safety risks, tax implications, and requires basic technical knowledge of blockchain. In contrast, the 0.25% expense ratio of the IBIT ETF is justified as it helps avoid these risks, making it a more secure and simpler option for investors. In one of my recent articles , I discussed the top Bitcoin ETFs available in the market today. Some readers reached out asking about the difference between self custody and ETFs, and whether I recommend either of them. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) is my top recommendation as far as Bitcoin ETFs go, and this article will explain why, in my opinion, it is preferable than self custody for most investors. Disclaimer: Self-custody of Bitcoin carries significant implications for tax filing, safety, and more. This article is not financial advice, and it is not intended as a guide or encouragement for self-custody of Bitcoin. This article also does not endorse any specific cryptocurrency service providers, exchanges, or related entities. It merely provides an overview of the basics of self-custody, and it is mainly focused on the IBIT ETF as a prime way to invest in Bitcoin. If you are considering self-custody for your Bitcoin, I strongly encourage you to conduct further research to fully understand the responsibilities and risks involved. Thesis: For the vast majority of investors, IBIT represents the optimal choice for gaining exposure to Bitcoin The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF offers a straightforward, efficient and safe method for gaining exposure to Bitcoin. I believe that most investors turn to Bitcoin either for short- to mid-term trading or because they see it as a potential new world reserve asset in the long term. In both scenarios, IBIT stands out as the most sensible option for accessing Bitcoin, given its ease of use, safety and simplicity. Self-custody of Bitcoin is preferable only for individuals looking to explore the crypto space and engage in Bitcoin transactions, or for those aiming to avoid government oversight. IBIT: ETF profile and key considerations The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF is one of the largest and more liquid Bitcoin ETFs available on the market today. It has a 0.25% expense ratio, and an average bid/ask spread of only 0.03%. With just below of $18 Billion in Asset Under Management, it is at the moment of writing the second largest Bitcoin ETF after the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ). The latter, however, is not competitive as a Bitcoin ETF, due to the high expense ratio. Bitcoin ETF comparison (Author's elaboration of publicly available data) As shown in the table above, the IBIT ETF is one of the most competitive-listed products to get exposed to Bitcoin. It is highly liquid, with a reasonable expense ratio. BlackRock is also investing significantly in marketing IBIT, more so than any other ETF issuer. Larry Fink, the co-founder and CEO of BlackRock, has conducted multiple media interviews discussing his views on Bitcoin. I believe BlackRock’s strategic emphasis on IBIT provides an additional advantage, signaling that they will continue to support this ETF moving forward. Ease of use and tax considerations The IBIT ETF can be purchased via any major brokerage account. Some jurisdictions, for example the UK, are still not allowing brokers to offer crypto-related products at the time of writing this article. However, since it is a regular ETF under the SEC jurisdiction, it can be accessed by all US-based readers. Even outside of the US, for example in Switzerland where I am based, the IBIT ETF can be accessed and purchased with relative ease. From a fiscal standpoint, investing in the IBIT ETF also entails a relatively easy way to file taxes. As with other ETFs, tax reports are available via the broker of choice and can be used to declare the value and capital appreciation of an investor’s Bitcoin holdings. For US-based readers, the fiscal implications of investing in Bitcoin via IBIT are somewhat complicated. I am not based in the US, nor this article is intended as a guide on how to file US taxes related to Bitcoin. However, I know that the IBIT ETF is structured as a grantor trust, which makes their tax reporting in the U.S. somewhat complicated. Investors in these ETFs must manually calculate and report their expenses, gains, and losses to the IRS. Additionally, they must adjust the basis of their investment to reflect these figures, adding an extra layer of complexity to their tax obligations. While this is a somewhat complicated process, I believe it is still far easier than having to independently extract the above information from a self custody situation. Safety considerations The crypto space is well-known for being plagued by scams. For instance, Gary Gensler, the current chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has described the crypto environment as ""rife with abuses and fraud."" The specific risks associated with scams will be detailed in the next sections. Choosing to invest in Bitcoin through the IBIT ETF eliminates the necessity for any technical knowledge about blockchain or cryptocurrency in general and shields investors from crypto-related scams. Demystifying Self Custody of Bitcoin To understand self custody, it's important to understand the blockchain and the basics of Bitcoin. In a nutshell, the blockchain is a secure, decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across multiple computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively. Bitcoin is a digital currency that operates on its own blockchain to enable secure, peer-to-peer transactions. Self custody means directly holding Bitcoin with access to its blockchain. This involves having a Bitcoin Wallet, essentially a ""key"" that allows you to access and manage your Bitcoin on the blockchain, enabling you to send it to other wallets. Bitcoin self custody 101 To store Bitcoin in self-custody, setting up a Bitcoin wallet is the first step. A wallet serves to store Bitcoin and token private keys. A common misconception among newcomers to crypto is that a wallet is a physical object necessary for accessing the blockchain, and losing it means losing access to one’s Bitcoin. This is not the case. When a wallet is created on Bitcoin’s blockchain, a “seed phrase” consisting of 12 to 21 randomized characters is received. This seed phrase is what is actually needed to access the blockchain. If access to the physical wallet is lost, it can be regained on another device (or software application) as long as the seed phrase is available. A wallet can be either ""hot"" or ""cold."" The difference lies in connectivity; hot wallets are constantly connected to the internet, while cold wallets are not and must be connected only when there is the need of sending Bitcoin to another wallet. Most hot crypto wallets are software-based, for example with a browser extension, whereas cold wallets are physical devices that provide access to Bitcoin. For self-custody, a cold wallet is preferable because Bitcoin can only be moved from the wallet by physically using the device. This provides an added layer of protection against hacking or scams, which I will describe in the next paragraphs. Once a cold Bitcoin wallet is established, the next step is transferring Bitcoin into it. The most efficient method, in my opinion, is to open an account with a major crypto exchange, such as Coinbase Global, Inc. ( COIN ), to purchase Bitcoin. Almost all crypto exchanges allow for the withdrawal of Bitcoin to a personal wallet. The transfer process itself is typically straightforward and well-documented by the exchanges. Generally, all that is needed for sending Bitcoin to a wallet is the wallet’s address, which is also provided within the wallet itself. Safety and self custody Self custody effectively means storing the 12 to 21 characters seed phrase that is needed to access a wallet. If anyone manages to have access to a seed phrase, they will be able to access the Bitcoin and send it to another wallet of their choice. The primary risk associated with self-custody is how and where the seed phrase is stored. Safely storing a seed phrase is akin to safeguarding a valuable item. Options for secure storage include using a safe, a bank vault, or encrypted software, among others. Each storage method has significant security implications that must be carefully considered. Additionally, self-custody carries the risk of scams. Many crypto scammers attempt to trick individuals into entering their seed phrases on malicious websites or software, thereby gaining access to their wallets. This risk is particularly acute with hot wallets, which are more susceptible to phishing attacks as they are constantly online. Due to the risk of scams, I've mentioned that cold wallets are generally preferable for self-custody. However, an even safer method is using a paper wallet . This is essentially a piece of paper that contains the seed phrase needed to access Bitcoin. Bitcoin can still be sent to the associated address, but since the wallet itself isn't accessible electronically, it represents the safest form of self-custody. Whether IBIT is the best choice depends on why you invest in Bitcoin Whether self custody is a preferable option, really comes down to why an investor is getting exposed to Bitcoin. Originally envisioned as a decentralized currency, Bitcoin enables users to exchange goods and services without relying on traditional banking systems or governmental oversight. For those intending to use Bitcoin as an internet currency, having a wallet and opting for self-custody is essential. However, Bitcoin has evolved and is increasingly viewed as a potential reserve asset, rather than merely an online currency. I believe that many current investors are gaining exposure to Bitcoin because they think it will gain institutional adoption and eventually become a global reserve asset similar to gold. For investors who align with this perspective, the IBIT ETF stands out as the superior choice. It is simpler, safer and easier to use compared to self custody. In my view, its 0.25% expense ratio is justified when compared to the complexities of self custody. Risks (and advantages) of using the IBIT ETF From the information provided in the last sections of this article, it should be apparent that the IBIT ETF offers a hassle-free method to access Bitcoin. In contrast, self-custody of Bitcoin involves a higher risk associated with storage and requires a certain level of familiarity with blockchain technology. To sum up, the advantages of the IBIT ETF are: Ease of use - IBIT can be accessed with any major brokerage account. You also do not need to have any technical knowledge about Crypto, or the Bitcoin blockchain, to get exposed to it. Safety - by using the IBIT ETF, you are safe from crypto scammers and mistakes. Bitcoins are held by BlackRock for you in wallets you do not have access to. Fiscal simplicity - by purchasing a regular ETF, your taxation is generally easier, as your assets are held in a brokerage account that releases tax documents to file your taxes. The risks of using the IBIT ETF are: Your Bitcoin cannot be used for transactions on the Blockchain. You won’t be able to buy anything with your Bitcoin, nor Your Bitcoin cannot be “hidden” from governmental entities as it is stored by BlackRock for you, in a regular brokerage account. The expense ratio of 0.25%, while low, is somewhat significant compared to self custody. This is especially true if you are a believer in Bitcoin as the hardest asset in history. Giving up 0.25% of a non-cash flow generating asset is significant. An alternative to the IBIT ETF and self custody is investing in Bitcoin via MicroStrategy ( MSTR ). I recently covered this option in an article . I believe that MSTR represents a leveraged, highly volatile bet on Bitcoin. If you can stomach high volatility, MSTR has the advantage of having historically increased its Bitcoin per share. Additionally, the company does not charge any fee to manage its Bitcoin stack - actually, the legacy software business of MicroStrategy generates a steady cash flow that is effectively used to maintain the entire company. Conclusion For most investors, the IBIT ETF represents the best choice to get exposure to Bitcoin. It is easy to get access to, simple, and investors do not need to understand the inner workings of Bitcoin and the blockchain to invest in it. This shields them from scams or physical risks related to self custody. Finally, it is simpler to handle for tax purposes. The only use case for self custody is for investors wanting to use Bitcoin as an online currency, sending it and receiving it without the oversight of financial institutions and governments. I believe this represents a small user base, especially in the context of Bitcoin’s increasing adoption .",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4693365-ibit-etf-a-better-alternative-to-bitcoin-self-custody-for-most-investors?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/27837287.jpeg

Meme Coin Surges On Back Of GameStop Nostalgia,"The internet’s resident amphibian is back in the spotlight, but this time Pepe the Frog isn’t gracing troll forums – he’s maneuvering his way to the top of the cryptocurrency charts. PEPE, the meme coin named after the internet legend, is experiencing a historic surge, fueled by a potent mix of nostalgia and retail investor fervor. Related Reading: On A Tear: Toncoin Outshines Bitcoin With Price Surge And Social Buzz From Backwater To Bullfrog: PEPE’s Rise PEPE’s recent ascent is nothing short of meteoric. Trading volume has skyrocketed by an impressive 300% in the past 24 hours, with the price reaching an all-time high. This dramatic rise coincides with a resurgence in Gamestop (GME) stock, leading many to believe that the retail investor army of 2021 is back for round two, armed with meme coins as their weapon of choice. The return of Keith Gill, better known online as “Roaring Kitty,” has acted as a rallying cry for these digital warriors. Gill’s surprise post on his dormant Reddit account sent shockwaves through the market, reigniting the nostalgic flames of the original Gamestop saga. Analysts suggest this nostalgia has spilled over into the crypto market, sparking a full-blown meme coin craze. PEPE, already experiencing a steady climb since mid-April, has emerged as the unlikely champion of this digital meme menagerie. Whales Take A Dip In The Pepe Pond It’s not just the small-time investors driving the PEPE surge. Big money, or “whales” in crypto speak, are also diving headfirst into the frenzy. On-chain data reveals a whale recently splashing out a cool 1.86 million USDC for a whopping 195 billion PEPE tokens. Another whale scooped up a hefty 406 million PEPE, further propelling the price upwards. This guy spent 1.86M $USDC to buy 195B $PEPE 12 hours ago and has now made an unrealized profit of $236K.https://t.co/TSngBKN2yC pic.twitter.com/Oszxx3nIO2 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 14, 2024 But Is It All Golden Memes And Rainbows? While PEPE’s current trajectory is a dream come true for early adopters, a cautionary tale lurks beneath the frothy surface. Meme coins are notorious for their wild volatility. Their value is often built on hype and fleeting internet trends, not robust financial fundamentals. This means a sudden shift in sentiment could trigger a dramatic price crash, leaving investors holding the Pepe bag.

The stolen funds have been frozen by major exchanges.  Bitcoin DeFi application ALEX Lab was drained of over $4.3 million in various tokens early Wednesday after a suspected private key compromise attacked its bridging service.  Security researchers CertiK said the attackers likely caught hold of a private key that controlled ALEX’s XLink bridge, a service that lets users transfer tokens between different blockchains. The hacker transferred over $300,000 worth of bitcoin {{BTC}}, $3.3 million worth of stablecoins and $75,000 worth of Sugar Kingdom (SKO) tokens.  ALEX developers confirmed the hack in an X post in early European hours, claiming they knew the identity of the attacker. The team offered them a 10% bounty for the return of 90% of the stolen funds.  “ALEX Lab Foundation has identified the individual responsible for the recent security breach and is offering a resolution through a bounty arrangement,” the developers said. “ALEX assures that upon compliance, there will be no further pursuit or law enforcement involvement. This offer stands until May 18 at 0800 UTC.”  Funds associated with the hacker have been frozen by major exchanges to prevent further misuse, the team said.  Private key compromises are among hackers’ most common attack vectors.

42408237,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaBaZh,1715758250,"Bitcoin Fee Crash Could Lead to Faster Miner Selling, Analysts Say","Bitcoin’s mean transaction fee has reversed the post-halving Runes-led spike.  Analysts said the decline in fees and the stalled BTC price rally may lead to selling pressure from miners.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} miners reduced their coin inventory before the reward halving took effect on April 19. The trend could soon resume as the blockchain has become cheaper to use, squeezing miners’ revenue.  ""Daily average network fees spiked after the halving, offsetting some pain for bitcoin miners. However, fees have since come down as the initial rush of users to the Runes protocol cooled off,"" analysts at Kaiko said in a weekly note titled ""Reality Bites for Miners.""  ""The recent decline in fees could lead to selling pressure from miners,"" analysts added.  Bitcoin's price already face downside risks from long-defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt.Gox's impending $9 billion payout to its creditors, and a potential increase in selling pressure from miners may worsen the situation.  Bitcoin miners earn revenue from two sources: block rewards and transaction fees. Miners receive a fixed amount of BTC as a reward for adding new blocks to the blockchain, along with transaction fees for including transactions in the blocks they mine.  Last month's halving reduced the per-block coin emission to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC, putting the onus of compensating the negative impact on miner profitability on transaction fees and bitcoin's price.  The mean transaction fee initially cooperated, surging from 0.0003 BTC to a six-year high of 0.00199 BTC immediately after halving, according to data tracked by Glassnode. The spike came as traders rushed to ""etch"" and mint tokens on top of the Bitcoin blockchain with the help of fungible token protocol Runes.  However, the sugar rush from Runes was short-lived and the mean fee quickly tanked levels seen before halving. As of Tuesday, the mean transaction fee was 0.000039 BTC.  Meanwhile, bitcoin's price has declined over 4% to $61,990 since halving, CoinDesk data show.  ""The higher fees had alleviated some of the post-halving stress on bitcoin miners, but they are beginning to feel the pressure of the slashed miner rewards,"" Kaiko said. ""The halving has typically been a selling event for Bitcoin miners as the process of creating new blocks incurs significant costs, forcing miners to sell to cover costs.""  At press time, wallets associated with miners held 1.805 million BTC ($111.5 billion), according to Glassnode.  Markus Thielen, head of 10x Research, expects miners to liquidate roughly $5 billion of BTC in the coming months.  ""Why would they keep inventory when the price is not going up,"" Thielen said, explaining his view.  Crypto exchange Deribit made a similar observation on X, discussing an option strategy called ""bear call spread"" to navigate a potential miner-led drawdown in bitcoin's price.  ""Bitcoin forms lower highs and miners facing shrinking revenues and fees, are pressurized to sell their holdings. For traders looking to navigate this market, the Bear Call Spread strategy can be a suitable approach to consider,"" Deribit said.  A bear call strategy is a two-legged option strategy taken when the view on the market is moderately bearish.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/15/bitcoin-fee-crash-could-lead-to-faster-miner-selling-analysts-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/236e102f2a542d1b3efda446050843ac7047008e-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418245,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcxy9,1715758200,Crypto's Election Season Is Kicking Off,"The U.S. is holding its presidential election this fall. More than half a dozen other countries and bodies are likewise holding – or have held – elections this year. Some candidates and lawmakers have already addressed crypto, whether appealing to the industry or just commenting on the technology. The extent to which there is such a thing as a ""crypto voter"" remains unclear, but it is undeniable that there is a wave of attention directed at this industry.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Spotlight's on  The narrative  There are more than half a dozen elections this year, from the U.S.'s presidential election this fall to the European Union's election next month to South Korea's election last month and more. While crypto isn't shaping up to be a major election issue in most of these, we've still heard candidates – including former U.S. President and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump – directly address members of the crypto community.  Why it matters  Crypto has not really been an issue in past elections. Sure, there have been candidates who had previously addressed crypto or were adjacent to the industry, but there wasn't really a concerted effort to try and solicit people who believe crypto is a major, or the major, factor for their vote. To some extent, that seems to be changing, though it's still hard to quantify the extent to which the crypto contingent will be a major voting bloc.  Breaking it down  This year, CoinDesk is looking to cover the elections as comprehensively as possible, with a focus on crypto and related issues. The first wave of stories we published focused on the extent to which crypto might be an issue in some of these elections, and the extent to which industry participants in different countries expect the election results to affect crypto policy.  Indonesia's incoming vice president, for example, said he wanted to improve technology education – including crypto and blockchain education – during his campaign.  And in the U.S., a massive wave of attention hit last week, after former U.S. President Donald Trump (who's the clear favorite to win the Republican Party's nomination this year) told a group of his NFT holders that he's ""for that"" in reference to crypto. This comes barely three months after he said ""you probably have to do some regulation"" around crypto, and years after he famously said he was ""not a fan of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.""  We're off to the races.  As Danny Nelson reported, it's unclear whether Trump understands the issues around crypto, but he's reaching out to the crypto community nonetheless. His comments sparked a large amount of discussion online about whether he is the bulwark against what's seen within crypto circles as an administrative state's overreach or what role crypto voters might play in the election. Current President Joe Biden's administration has not been the friendliest to crypto, with an array of actions from the Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Justice taking on crypto's largest exchanges and other companies and services. What will happen as the presidential campaigns shift to the general election in the coming weeks is unclear.  These are questions that warrant further investigation through the coming months. For now, I leave you with CoinDesk's first wave of stories covering the potential effect elections might have in various nations.

(Wired) Wired's Andy Greenberg digs through the Dutch case against Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev. A few important details that spring to mind: 1) the Dutch case seems to be that Pertsev, by helping build Tornado Cash, directly enabled its usage by malign actors; 2) the U.S. case against fellow dev Roman Storm also alleges that Storm retained a bit more control for longer than his defense claims, and that he also profited from Tornado Cash's usage. Pertsev was found guilty, and it remains to be seen how Storm's case will play out.  (Forbes) Forbes reports that defense company called Leonardo is testing technology that surveils ""anything that emits a signal, including phones, smartwatches"" and other items, and can be used to create ""electronic signatures"" for people without warrants.

27832238,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608063,1715757345,"$291 Billion Asset Manager Founder Predicts Bitcoin Will Hit $420,000","In an interview with Yahoo Finance’s “Wealth,” Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals and $291 billion asset manager Edelman Financial Services, provided a striking forecast for the Bitcoin price. Edelman argued that Bitcoin’s price could surge to $420,000, attributing this potential rise to a modest global asset allocation towards Bitcoin. Why Bitcoin Price Will Reach $420,000 During the interview, Edelman delved into the advantages of investing in Spot Bitcoin ETFs. He noted that these instruments make Bitcoin accessible in the same way as traditional ETFs, which are commonplace and familiar to investors using ordinary brokerage accounts. “They’re incredibly inexpensive, 20-25 basis points cheaper than going to say Coinbase or other crypto exchange and being in a brokerage account, you can rebalance, you can dollar cost average, you can tax loss harvest,” Edelman highlighted. This setup simplifies the investment process, making it akin to managing any other asset class, thus broadening its appeal to a wider audience. Related Reading: CPI Preview: Bitcoin Price Poised To Surge If Projections Hold True However, Edelman was also candid about the challenges and risks associated with Bitcoin. Despite the advantages offered by ETFs, the inherent nature of Bitcoin as a volatile and risky investment persists. “It’s still Bitcoin, which means it’s still very volatile, it’s still very risky. You could still lose everything,” he cautioned. Edelman pointed to ongoing regulatory uncertainty, potential lawsuits, and prevalent fraud as significant risks that investors need to manage cautiously. He also criticized the trend of investing due to fear of missing out (FOMO), labeling it as a poor investment rationale. Looking ahead, Edelman discussed the regulatory landscape, particularly concerning other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. He noted that there are several applications pending for Ethereum ETFs, and while he anticipates initial rejections, approvals could follow by year’s end. Related Reading: Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana: Galaxy Digital CEO Predicts Next Market Movements “After you have the Bitcoin ETFs and the Ethereum ETFs, I’m not sure how quickly you’ll see anything else after that, but these two will kind of open the doors long term. Five years from now, there will be dozens, perhaps even hundreds of crypto ETFs,” Edelman speculated. This perspective underscores a significant shift towards mainstream acceptance and integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional financial products. Edelman’s prediction of Bitcoin reaching $420,000 is based on an assumption of global asset diversification. By his calculations, if all global asset holders allocated just 1% of their assets to Bitcoin, this would translate to a market cap of $7.4 trillion for Bitcoin alone. “It’s remarkably simple. If you take a look at the world’s global assets, the value of the stock market, globally, the bond market, the real estate market, the gold market, you just look at all the assets everybody in the world owns, it’s about $740 trillion,” he explained. Such an allocation would dramatically increase Bitcoin’s market cap, driving its price up significantly. Moreover, Edelman highlighted a shift in the perception of Bitcoin from a transactional currency to a store of value, similar to gold. “The use case of Bitcoin, although it’s strong for transmittal, is not the strongest argument. It’s now like gold, a store of value,” he stated. This perception shift has attracted more institutional investors, who view Bitcoin as a hedge or an alternative asset class, akin to other non-traditional investments like artwork or collectibles. At press time, BTC traded at $61,909.

The price must settle above the $575 and $585 resistance levels to gain bullish momentum. BNB price started a fresh decline after it failed to clear the $600 resistance zone. The price is now trading below $585 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $575 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $585 resistance zone. BNB Price Dips Again After a decent increase, BNB price struggled near the $600 resistance. As a result, there was a bearish reaction below the $585 support, like Ethereum and Bitcoin. The price dipped below the $575 support and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). It traded as low as $561 and is currently consolidating losses. There was a minor upward move above the $565 level. The price tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $600 swing high to the $561 low. It is now trading below $585 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). Immediate resistance is near the $575 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $575 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. The next resistance sits near the $585 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $600 swing high to the $561 low. A clear move above the $585 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $600. A close above the $600 resistance might set the pace for a larger increase toward the $650 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $680 level in the coming days. More Losses? If BNB fails to clear the $575 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $560 level. The next major support is near the $550 level. The main support sits at $532. If there is a downside break below the $532 support, the price could drop toward the $510 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $500 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is losing pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BNB/USD is currently below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $565, $550, and $532.

They argue that Salame wasn’t involved in the core fraud perpetrated by Bankman-Fried’s inner circle.  Attorneys for Ryan Salame, a former FTX executive who pled guilty to election fraud charges in September, are asking the court for leniency in the form of an 18-month sentence, according to a sentencing memorandum filed on Tuesday.  While at FTX and Alameda, Salame managed wire deposits and fiat currency conversions for FTX customers, participated in political contributions using Alameda funds, and led charitable initiatives in The Bahamas.  In filings, his attorneys argue that Salame’s role at the shuttered companies was less central to the fraud and more operational. They also cite cooperation with authorities, genuine remorse, efforts to address his substance abuse issues, and the significant personal and financial losses he has already suffered as a result of the exchange’s collapse.  “He had absolutely no knowledge that the four people at the center of Alameda and FTX had conspired to lie and to steal from their customers. Ryan stole from no one. He did not lie to customers,” his attorneys wrote in a filing. “He was duped…when he finally understood the FTX fraud, he was the first person to blow the whistle to authorities in The Bahamas.""  In the document, his attorneys point out that information provided to Bahamanian authorities initiated their investigation into FTX, and he also provided documents to the U.S. Attorney’s Office without a grand jury subpoena.  Salame’s attorneys also write that the ""incessant media criticism of FTX and all else within Bankman-Fried’s orbit has ensured [he] will be punished for the rest of his life"" and argue that the legacy of FTX and his association with Bankman-Fried means that he'll never be able to seek another job without this association acting as a barrier.

The price could decline again in the near term if it stays below $0.5060 and $0.5120. XRP is struggling to gain pace for a move above the $0.5120 level. The price is now trading below $0.5050 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term declining channel forming with resistance at $0.5040 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a decent increase if there is a close above the $0.5120 resistance. XRP Price Stuck Near $0.50 Yesterday, we discussed how XRP price started a recovery wave, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move above the $0.4950 and $0.50 resistance levels. The price even moved above $0.5100, but the bears were active near the $0.5120 resistance. A high was formed at $0.5120 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.4865 swing low to the $0.5120 high. The price is now trading below $0.5050 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. However, the bulls are active above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.4865 swing low to the $0.5120 high. Immediate resistance is near the $0.5040 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a short-term declining channel forming with resistance at $0.5040 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The first key resistance is near $0.5060. A close above the $0.5060 resistance zone could send the price higher. The next key resistance is near $0.5120. If the bulls remain in action above the $0.5120 resistance level, there could be a rally toward the $0.5250 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5350 resistance. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5040 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.4965 level. The next major support is at $0.4925. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.4925 level, the price might accelerate lower. In the stated case, the price could even drop below the $0.4865 support zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.

27823363,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608050,1715743897,Bitcoin Price Holds Firm: Key Support Maintained Amid Market Uncertainty,"Bitcoin price is holding the key support at $60,000. BTC could start another increase and rise toward the range resistance at $63,500. Bitcoin is still trading in a range between $60,000 and $63,500. The price is trading above $61,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $61,550 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears $62,200 and $62,500. Bitcoin Price Remains Steady Bitcoin price started another decline from the $63,500 resistance zone. BTC traded below the $62,500 and $62,200 support levels. A low was formed at $61,000 and the price started a recovery wave. There was a move above the $61,250 and $61,500 levels. Besides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $61,550 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $63,400 swing high to the $61,000 low. Bitcoin is still trading above $61,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. Immediate resistance is near the $62,200 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $63,400 swing high to the $61,000 low. The first major resistance could be $62,500. The next key resistance could be $63,000. A clear move above the $63,000 resistance might send the price higher. The main resistance now sits at $63,500. If there is a close above the $63,500 resistance zone, the price could continue to move up. In the stated case, the price could rise toward $65,000. Another Drop In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to climb above the $62,500 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $61,550 level and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. The first major support is $61,000. If there is a close below $61,000, the price could start to drop toward $60,400. Any more losses might send the price toward the $60,000 support zone in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $61,550, followed by $61,000.

Bitcoin Has Been Reacting To Binance/Coinbase Volume Changes In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst discussed the dynamics in the cryptocurrency market that arise out of the battle happening between Binance and Coinbase for spot volume dominance. Related Reading: Newbie Bitcoin Whales Buying 200,000 BTC Per Week, Data Shows The quant shared a chart below that shows how this war for dominance has played out over the past decade. As the graph shows, Binance has been the much more dominant of the two platforms when considering the spot volume. The exchange is hosting five times as much volume as Coinbase. The analyst notes that the difference between the two would be even higher when considering the BTC-FDUSD pair, which isn’t included in the data depicted in the above chart. Despite the much lower spot volume, Coinbase still hasn’t been irrelevant in the market. For example, the platform is the custodian for Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like BlackRock’s IBIT and Grayscale’s GBTC. There also appears to be an interesting pattern between the dominance of the American exchange and the Bitcoin spot price. The quant has highlighted this trend in the graph. There have been a few instances where a rise in the spot trading volume of Coinbase against Binance has preceded surges in the value of cryptocurrency. Similarly, declines in the platform’s dominance have seemingly led to drawdowns in the Bitcoin price. The analyst has also discussed the trend in the volumes of the two exchanges more closely, using the spot volume ratio for them, as shown below. The chart shows that the spot volume ratio between Binance and Coinbase had spiked to very high levels in 2023, with the former’s volume being 53 times the latter’s. The reason behind this was the zero-fee scheme that Binance had introduced for the Bitcoin trading pairs. However, Coinbase’s volume has recently risen, although the ratio remains notably in favor of Binance. This shift in the market emerged as the Bitcoin spot ETF-related news started to intensify. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Be Set For New ATHs If It Breaks This Resistance: Analyst The quant concludes: The dynamics between these exchanges are complex, but the graphs show that each exchange’s dominance at specific times has a direct impact on the price of Bitcoin. It’s a true battle between the market’s biggest players, where competition is constant, and the outcome is reflected in cryptocurrency movements.

27815042,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608035,1715731214,XRP Set For Major Upswing: Top Analyst Reveals Timing For $10-$20 Price Milestone,"XRP, the cryptocurrency associated with Ripple, has been locked in a lengthy period of consolidation, trading between $0.300 and $0.600 for the past seven years. Despite a brief surge during the 2021 bull run that saw XRP reach a three-year high of $1.9 in April, the token has since returned to its range, lacking the bullish momentum to overcome upper resistance levels. However, some crypto analysts are now predicting a major uptrend for XRP in the coming months, potentially propelling it to new heights. Analysts Anticipate XRP Breakout A technical analyst using the pseudonym “U-COPY” on the social media site X (formerly Twitter) suggests that XRP could experience significant movement between May 15 and August. U-COPY points out that XRP has been slowly moving up from its previous low at $0.46 and is nearing the end of a long triangle formation, which has been in accumulation since 2018. The analyst believes that XRP’s real potential will be revealed in the fully formed bull cycle, with the token possibly experiencing substantial growth by the end of the year. Related Reading: Brace For Impact: Mt. Gox Set To Inject 142,000 BTC And 143,000 Bitcoin Cash Into The Market- Here’s When Supporting this bullish outlook, another analyst, Armando Pantoja, proposes that the crypto bull run could begin in September or October 2025, with XRP potentially reaching a price of $0.75. Pantoja further suggests that if former US President Trump wins the election and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) eases its stance on cryptocurrencies, XRP could be propelled to higher levels. This change in regulatory dynamics, combined with the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC, may increase the likelihood of XRP gaining approval for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) similar to Bitcoin. Pantoja outlines a price range of $1-2 for an XRP ETF announcement in early 2025. If interest rates are cut multiple times during the same period, XRP could potentially reach $5-10. Ultimately, Pantoja predicts the possibility of XRP hitting $10-$20 by the fourth quarter of 2025 or the first quarter of 2026. ‘Buy the Dip’ Opportunity? According to market intelligence platform Santiment, The XRP Ledger (XRPL) has recently witnessed a notable increase in the movement of dormant tokens, signaling a potential shift in market dynamics for the token. Coinciding with the opening of May, the company’s Token Age Consumed metric reveals a spike in the transfer of old coins, reminiscent of a similar occurrence in April, just before a significant downturn in the market. During that period, XRP experienced a sharp decline in value, dropping by 16%. However, in contrast to the previous event, Santiment suggests that there is a “compelling argument” that this current surge in old coin movement might be attributed to the interest of key stakeholders looking to “buy the dip.” Related Reading: This Crypto Expert Called The Bitcoin Top in 2021, Now He’s Calling The Bottom In 2024 Furthermore, it is worth noting the growing open interest in exchanges, which has recently reached a three-week high. This uptick in open interest indicates increased active positions in XRP, potentially reflecting growing market participation and heightened trading activity. Considering these factors together—the surge in dormant token activity, the potential buy-the-dip interest from key stakeholders, and the rising open interest on exchanges—there appears to be a shift in sentiment surrounding XRP. At press time, the seventh-largest cryptocurrency trades at $0.5020, down over 7% in the past week alone and 1% in the past 24 hours.
