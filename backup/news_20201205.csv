42433330,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO4Vdh,1607207906,Cardano to Launch Hard Fork Before Next Major Development Phase,"IOHK, the development team behind public blockchain project Cardano, said it is set to launch a hard fork in December as part of the transition to the third development phase of the protocol.      Dubbed ""Goguen,"" the third phase will be focused on the protocol’s integration of smart contracts after building Cardano’s foundation and decentralizing its system in the first two phases.      The hard fork will introduce the token-locking mechanism, one of its most significant new functions, to the mainnet. It will enable the network’s smart contracts to support certain conditions such as making users hold tokens for a fixed period of time in order to complete a contract.      While only having a slight impact on the actual ledger, the token-locking function will prepare the platform for smart contracts and the creation of assets that run on Cardano, Kevin Hammond, the company’s software engineer, said in a statement.      In addition, the upgrade will bring custom tokens into the network besides its native ADA token, Hammond said.      Founded in 2015, Cardano has experienced multiple hard forks to evolve through its five development phases, according to its roadmap. After the Goguen era, the protocol will go through the last two phases, Basho and Voltaire, to improve its scaling and governance functions.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET | FORKS,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/12/05/cardano-to-launch-hard-fork-before-next-major-development-phase,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c160f5ad2cd3549d8d9cd2dba8944e751432bb28-1500x825.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Since the exchange currently can not process all the withdrawals through its hot wallets, it said it has decided to suspend all withdrawals.      In the meantime, the platform will close all its over-the-counter (OTC) trading services because of the risks related to uncertainties surrounding China’s regulatory policies.      The State Council, China’s cabinet, announced a national crackdown on fraudulent bank accounts and SIM cards in October. “Fraudulent SIM cards and bank accounts are among the root causes that have enabled many phone and cyber scams,” according to the announcement.      People who want to avoid revealing their identity when opening a bank account or SIM card, many of whom are scammers, would buy existing SIM cards and bank accounts registered under others’ names.      Due to high demand for these fraudulent accounts, an industry has developed to create and sell these accounts, some of which are obtained via identity theft. Within two weeks of the State Council’s announcement, the Chinese police have arrested more than 4,600 people and confiscated about 65,000 bank cards that are linked to fraudulent banking accounts, according to a report by state media outlet CCTV.      More than 15,000 people involved in the crimes are barred from opening a new bank account in five years, according to the report.

According to Efforce, energy services companies (ESCOs) tend to have limited access to capital since they often are unable to turn to traditional banking channels, as banks lack the technical expertise to properly assess the return on investment.      ESCOs can register energy efficiency projects with Efforce and it will validate the projects, and evaluate their investment needs, calculate returns and create Energy Performance Contracts.      There will be a smart meter on the company’s blockchain to measure each project’s energy savings and turn them into energy credits that are saved in investors’ profiles for use or sale.

Net short open interest (OI) for CME leveraged funds, or the total amount of outstanding contracts, hit record levels for the past two weeks, according to CME Commitment of Traders reports published every Friday.  The market’s total OI hit record highs of $1.3 billion at the end of last month.  Despite a slight decrease in short positions in early November, this demographic of traders has continued increasing its short positions since September. Over the same time period, bitcoin has gained 60%.  Leveraged funds represent 62% of the total OI on CME’s bitcoin futures market.  CME traders likely opened some of these shorts are part of a carry trade in conjunction with long exposure in other bitcoin markets.  Also, the trades could be taken as hedges to reduce risk incurred by other open positions in the event of adverse price movements, explained Josh Olszewicz, bitcoin trader at Techemy Capital. Of course it’s hard to know for sure, but using CME bitcoin futures market to open hedging trades as well as exploiting the yield between CME markets and bitcoin spot price is a common strategy for many cryptocurrency trading firms.  Notably, OI for the other categories of CME traders is not nearly as bearish. For example, net OI for the catch-all category of “Other Reportable” traders, claiming 17% of total OI, is heavily long and near all-time highs.

The country's income tax authority is tracking investors making money amid the ongoing bitcoin price rally and is all set to demand taxes, two sources familiar with the matter said, according to The Economic Times (ET), a business-focused daily newspaper.  The tax department collected information about bitcoin trades executed through banking channels before the Reserve Bank of India's (the country's central bank) crypto ban took effect in April 2018. The Supreme Court overturned the ban in early March, bringing cheer to both investors and local cryptocurrency exchanges.  ""The tax authority can also monitor earnings of cryptocurrency investors registered through KYC/AML compliant exchanges like CoinDCX and through national identity documents such as the PAN card,"" Sumit Gupta, CEO of Mumbai-based cryptocurrency exchange CoinDCX,told CoinDesk, referring to know your customer/anti-money laundering rules.  Some experts are anticipating a 30% tax on cryptocurrency gains and many are advising their clients to file bitcoin returns as capital gains, which are associated with stocks, according to the article.  Amit Maheshwari, a partner at tax and consulting firm AMK Global, told the newspaper that bitcoin's active trading would be treated as a speculative business and attract normal tax rates. In contrast, authorities may treat one-off or infrequent transactions as capital gains, long-term or short-term, depending on the holding period, and levy a concessional rate of capital gains.  The tax authority has not yet categorized returns from cryptocurrencies under any specific bracket. ""Currently, if an investor submits his Income Tax declaration, the amount of earnings generated by investing in cryptocurrencies is highlighted under Income from Other Sources,'"" Gupta told CoinDesk.  The clarity on the tax and regulation front may bring more investor participation. While the Indian government does not consider bitcoin legal tender, holding cryptocurrencies is not necessarily illegal or banned.

CoinDesk previously reported the event, a kind of lottery, will allow the city's residents to apply to win 200 digital yuan as happened with the first such giveaway in Shenzhen in October.  According to Reuters, there will be a total of 10,000 winners this time around who will be able to spend the tokens at stores that are set up with point-of-sales technology that can handle the CBDC.  The Suzhou lottery kicks of on Dec. 12 – a shopping festival known as ""Double 12"" – and is said to be trialing functionality of the token including offline (phone-to-phone) payments.  Seemingly preparing the ground for the launch of the CBDC, China’s central bank proposed a banking law in October, recognizing the renminbi in both physical and digital form, and outlawing all third-party rivals. This would likely be a blow to cryptocurrencies like Tether's yuan stablecoin if passed.
