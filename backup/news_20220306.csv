A declining trend like the rest of the market but the leading smart contract platform has been on the receiving end of one of the most brutal beat downs. The digital asset that had managed to touch the $3,000 level last week had quickly lost its footing which saw its spiraling down once more. However, Ethereum did not establish any significant support, so it had continued to decline. With the recent decline, the digital asset had crumbled below significant support points. These include the 20 and 50-day simple moving averages which are crucial in establishing support and subsequent bottom for a cryptocurrency. For Ethereum, this has placed significant sell pressure on investors, and sell-offs have continued to rock the digital asset. Related Reading | Bitcoin Falls Back To $38,000 As Russia Steps Up Bombardment Of Ukraine One thing to note is the lack of any short-term support for Ethereum. For an asset to dip below its 50-day moving average, it shows reluctance on the part of investors to want to purchase the digital asset, and without any buying pressure, the supply of ETH on the market continues to outpace demand, hence eliminating scarcity and leading to a decline in the value. This puts ETH on a dangerous path going into the next bear market.

The cryptocurrency which had been following the market trend had broken off the step with the rest of the space as the news sent ripples through the community. The plunge which occurred on Sunday came as a direct result of uncertainty spread across the community after Anton Nell announced that he, alongside Andre Conje, would be exiting the space. Nell had taken to Twitter to post the shocking exit. According to him, he and Conje had been planning their exit for a while and would officially stop contributing to the crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi) space.

42423700,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2ecVh,1646585530,Dozens of Tokens Tumble as Prolific Developer Andre Cronje Calls It Quits,"Prices for dozens of tokens are plunging on the news that prolific developer Andre Cronje is calling it quits – including prices for many that only have tenuous links to the DeFi maven.  On Sunday, frequent collaborator Anton Nell announced on Twitter he and Cronje were “closing the chapter” on developing in decentralized finance.  Many observers assumed such an announcement was imminent because Cronje deleted his Twitter account and updated his LinkedIn account last week to reflect that he was no longer an adviser to the Fantom Foundation.  Despite these warning signs, the market reacted violently to the news.  The token associated with the recently released Solidly, a hybrid automated market maker (AMM), tumbled as much as 75% on the day. Likewise, automation platform Keep3r's token is likewise down 25%, and that of lending platform Iron Bank is down 50%. All these protocols were founded by Cronje.  Broad drawdown  The effect has even reached projects that only have tenuous ongoing links to Cronje.  For years now Cronje has publicly stated he has not been involved in the day-to-day operations of Yearn Finance, a yield vault protocol he turned over to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) with a now-mythical “fair launch” in July 2020. Nonetheless, the YFI token tumbled as much as 12%, and is down 7.5% at the time of writing.  Likewise, the tokens of much of the Fantom ecosystem are drastically lower today. Spookyswap (BOO) is down 19%, LiquidDriver (LQDR) 17%, Tomb 22% (TOMB) and Geist Finance (GEIST) 15%, despite the fact that Cronje was not known to be significantly involved in any of their development.  Lasting impact  Throughout his career, Cronje has had a strained relationship with DeFi. He often takes to his blog to decry speculators and riff on the psychological perils of building; his protocols have driven billions in value and also been hacked for millions of dollars; he has taken months-long sabbaticals from the space in the past.  Nonetheless, Nell emphasized the latest exit was not a “knee-jerk” reaction and is indeed final.  From a practical perspective, however, many have noted that Cronje’s exit will not impact on the operations of many of the protocols in which he was involved.  While Nell’s farewell post noted that many websites will be shutting down as a result of the pair’s decision to step away, these sites are merely front ends for largely autonomous contracts Cronje deployed months or even years ago.  Indeed, in the hours since the announcement teams have already begun announcing the launch of new front ends for interacting with these contracts, such as one team replacing Cronje’s bribe.crv.finance.  “The source code is open source, anyone that would like to continue hosting this service is welcome to,” reads a pop-up disclaimer on many of Cronje’s soon-to-be-defunct sites.",NEGATIVE,YFI,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | FTM | MARKET | YFI,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/06/dozens-of-tokens-tumble-as-prolific-developer-andre-cronje-calls-it-quits,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b7a8ab867106544f4bc6a2b7d24d88e2f9380d51-500x500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421665,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXotiP,1646581800,Why Did Bitcoin Surge So Much Against the Ruble?,"Last Tuesday, bitcoin (BTC) hit an all-time high measured in rubles (RUB). Does that really mean anything?  Price feeds don’t tell the full story when comparing asset prices across different currencies, especially when one of those currencies is issued by a country facing financial sanctions for invading Ukraine (and the other is magic internet money).  A quick look at USD/RUB tells most of the story. One U.S. dollar was worth 84 rubles on Friday, Feb. 25 and over 114 rubles on Tuesday, March 1. With that type of devaluation, you might reasonably expect many assets priced in rubles to hit all-time highs soon, especially if the trend continues.  However, the ruble losing 37% of its U.S. dollar value would explain something around a 37% gain in “bitcoin in ruble” (USD and its stablecoin equivalents represent the most used trading pair for bitcoin, so this is an OK assumption). It wouldn’t immediately explain why bitcoin gained more than 55% (from 3.2 million to 4.9 million rubles); the excess gain suggests there was some other demand factor at play. Plus, the USD price of bitcoin is still more than 50% off of all-time highs.  Where is the demand coming from?  Depending on which parts of Crypto Twitter you frequent, on your familiarity with the history of cryptocurrency, your political leanings, your general level of cynicism or your insistence on being a Luddite, you might have one of two different hypotheses about what is going on:  The ultra-wealthy Russians who started a war are using bitcoin to sidestep sanctions because they need money to continue waging war.  The regular people in Russia and Ukraine are piling into bitcoin to sidestep sanctions because they need money to live (or they want to preserve some wealth).  Between the two, the latter is more likely than the former. Anecdotal stories and “what-ifs” suggest masses can pile into bitcoin to preserve wealth as their countries go to war, while Bitcoin’s transparent ledger is not going to do Vladimir Putin’s government any favors in avoiding sanctions (as we mentioned in last week’s newsletter).  These conversations are fun to have, but it may not be regular people either. This is a global asset after all.  Let’s see what the data says.  The data  Unlike the ruble, the Ukrainian hryvnia (UAH) hasn’t lost too much value in U.S. dollar terms. But, according to data from Kaiko, bitcoin traded at a 6% premium to USD on Binance’s UAH market following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, which suggests a demand surge.  Additional data from Binance shows the volume of the BTC/RUB trading pair spiked more than 240% above the 30-day trailing average in RUB terms on Feb. 28 and more than 400% on Feb. 24.  With these two data points in mind, it makes sense to then look at the types of bitcoin holders that may have emerged to figure out if these are new holders or something different. Noelle Acheson (former CoinDesker and former author of Crypto Long & Short) posted a great tweet thread outlining the exercise that she, I and a lot of people in the industry went through last week. It’s long, but it's certainly worth reading in full if you have time. I'll summarize here.  First, we consider the number of bitcoin addresses that are holding ≥ $1. There was an uptick from 34,564,788 to 35,035,127 from Feb. 27 to March 1. Digging in further here, the number of Bitcoin addresses that were holding > 1,000 bitcoin also ticked up from 2,121 to 2,257 over the same period. While the general growth in addresses supports the idea that regular people are coming into Bitcoin, the growth in addresses with > 1,000 BTC (> $40 million) does not.  Digging a bit deeper here. Glassnode has an unreleased metric in its product offering called the “Wallet Cohort Trend Accumulation Score,'' which breaks down the size of wallets which are accumulating bitcoin. According to their most recent chart on Feb. 27, smaller holders have been the most aggressive in accumulating bitcoin.  So that’s great, regular people are getting bitcoin. But how do we explain the increase in the amount of larger addresses? From Noelle’s tweet thread:  “But a look at the total amount of BTC held in these addresses actually declined, suggesting that this was more likely to be a case of exchange wallet reshuffling.”  The corresponding data is shown below and this view is generally corroborated across the industry.  All of this supports what bitcoiners have been saying for a while now – bitcoin is not being used by warmongers to avoid sanctions (for now). Instead, I think it is more likely that it is being used by regular people hoping to preserve wealth as war rages on.  However, there isn’t a consensus yet. Citigroup (C) analysts said the following, citing a chart showing bitcoin purchases in RUB rising in absolute bitcoin terms to around 450 BTC:  ""Russian volumes have been relatively small so far, suggesting that the price action is more due to investors positioning for an expected uptick in demand from Russia, rather than Russian demand itself.""  This is a good point. People like making money even in the face of tragedy (just check out the spike in donations to Ukraine after the government confirmed, and then unconfirmed, an airdrop of new tokens to donors). In the end, this could just be traders taking positions in anticipation of increased demand.
