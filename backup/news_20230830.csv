However, with the Grayscale victory against the SEC coming on Tuesday, August 29, and sending a positive wave across the entire region, open interest in the digital asset has begun to surge once more. Bitcoin Open Interest Pulls A Quick Reversal On-chain data tracking platform Kaiko reported on Tuesday, August 29, that the Bitcoin open interest had been on the decline for a while. In the chart shared by the tracker, it is obvious that this BTC metric had previously fallen significantly since 2022. Related Reading: Is Vitalik Buterin Selling His ETH Stash? Let‚Äôs Take A Look At His Transactions ü§îüìà#BTC open interest continued declining last week after the Aug 17 sell-off, hitting its lowest level since the collapse of Terra in May 2022.üóìÔ∏è pic.twitter.com/M5L07ReabY ‚Äî Kaiko (@KaikoData) August 29, 2023 As August drew to a close, the open interest in the digital asset eventually declined to levels not seen since the Terra network collapse back in May 2022. This suggested that it could be a good chance to get into Bitcoin and it would be proven true not too long after. On the same day, news broke that Grayscale had triumphed over the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in court over its bid for its Spot Bitcoin ETF filing to be reconsidered. This triggered a rapid uptrend in the price of the digital asset and the open interest followed suit. According to data from Coinglass, the Bitcoin open interest is seeing double-digit growth on some exchanges already. The open interest on the dYdX exchange is up over 35%, and the cumulative open interest across all exchanges is now in the green, rising 9.55% in the last 24 hours. Open interest recovers following Grayscale win | Source: Coinglass Does This Mean BTC Will Continue The Uptrend? For now, the price of Bitcoin is still purely driven by the hype from the Grayscale victory. This means that there is no telling how long the uptrend will last and when it will start correcting downward. However, as long as investors remain optimistic about the victory, BTC will continue to enjoy green days.

For example, a look at Keiko‚Äôs chart shows open interest was high leading up to the FTX collapse in 2022. Then in early 2023 when the price of Bitcoin was rallying, open interest fell before picking up steam once more. For now, BTC is still enjoying the spike in attention. The price of the cryptocurrency is up 5.35% in the last 24 hours to trade at $27,349.

While the rally signals potential, BTC still needs to overcome significant resistance at higher levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Insider Trading Suspicions Take Root Following Grayscale Win, What‚Äôs Happening? As of this writing, Bitcoin (BTC) trades at $27,300 with a 5% profit in the last 24 hours. In the previous seven days, BTC recorded similar profits as other cryptocurrencies in the top 10 see gains for the first time in over two weeks. $30,000 Are The $12,000, A Bitcoin Bull Run In The Making According to Bloomberg Intelligence‚Äôs Mike McGlone, the current Bitcoin price action is akin to that display before the 2020 bull run. At that time, macroeconomic forces influenced the crypto market as BTC prepared for a Halving event. The cryptocurrency also struggled to reclaim a critical level of around $12,000. McGlone believes that $30,000 is similar to that level and that breaching it would open the door for further gains, but are the conditions given for such an event? NewsBTC has reported that the biggest catalyzer for a Bitcoin bull run lies with the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). The cryptocurrency might have a massive capital inflow if the regulator approves a spot BTC Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). Yesterday, asset manager Grayscale scored a victory against the Commission, and a US judge ruled in favor of the company in their Bitcoin ETF lawsuit. The expert commented the following on this development and how it can pave the way for a BTC rally: The inevitable approval of Bitcoin exchange traded funds in the US is moving closer, but the elephant in the room for all risk assets remains ‚Äì the Fed is still tightening (‚Ä¶). Sustaining back above $30,000 would indicate a reversal upwards akin to a similar pattern around $12,000 in 2H20. Of course, McGlone doubts the cryptocurrency can push above $30,000 in the short term. Despite the similarities between the current price action and 2020, there are two significant obstacles: the Fed‚Äôs monetary policy and the low liquidity in the financial markets. As a result of these conditions, the chart below shows the BTC price trending to the downside, with volatility moving in the opposite direction. The expert believes this dynamic potentially sets the stage for Bitcoin to drop into the $12,000 region.

A set of ad hoc creditors, the Fair Deal Group, also filed an objection to the proposed plan on similar grounds, saying the proposed agreement would fail to secure all of the debts Genesis is owed and that Genesis has not demonstrated it would be able to ""confirm a viable plan.""  ""On August 29, 2023, the Debtors revealed an 'agreement in principle' among the Debtors, the Committee, and DCG [Digital Currency Group] that is woefully light on specifics and remains subject to definitive documentation,"" the Gemini filing said. ""The limited information provided by the Debtors makes clear that the proposed deal is also woefully light in economic consideration.""  Genesis, which shares a parent company with CoinDesk in DCG, filed for bankruptcy in January. In its Aug. 29 filing, attorneys for the bankrupt lender said unsecured creditors could receive up to 90% of the U.S. dollar equivalent of their holdings, though full details were not shared.  Wednesday's filing follows another from a third group of creditors ‚Äì the Ad Hoc Group of Genesis Lenders ‚Äì who similarly argued that Digital Currency Group's role is ""wholly insufficient to satisfy even the uncontested loan amounts due.""  The three parties also called for an end to a special exclusivity period which allowed Genesis to negotiate terms for resolving its bankruptcy through mediations.  ""Debtors have repeatedly promised that a plan that resolves claims against DCG is right around the corner, as they seek extension after extension of mediation periods, hearing dates, and bid deadlines,"" the Gemini filing said. The harm to Gemini is made worse, it added, as DCG has ""not paid any of the approximately $630 million in loans that came due to the Debtors in May 2023.""

16748751,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549483,1693429234,Shibarium Reaches Key Goals: Is SHIB Poised For New Heights?,"In a surprising turn of events, Shiba Inu (SHIB) experienced a brief consolidation break, reaching a 10-day high of $0.00000850, following the overall market uptrend on Tuesday. This upswing was further fueled by Grayscale‚Äôs legal victory against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However, Shibarium, the Ethereum layer-2 network backed by SHIB tokens, was the most significant catalyst for the newfound optimism. Shibarium‚Äôs Resurgence Fuels Bullish Sentiment For SHIB Price Shibarium, the layer-2 blockchain explicitly designed for the Shiba Inu token SHIB, has achieved a significant milestone with a remarkable surge in wallet count, reaching 337,100. Related Reading: $28,100 Next Level To Break For Bitcoin, Here‚Äôs Why This surge in new wallet addresses indicates renewed interest and heightened expectations, following recent challenges faced by the SHIB-backed layer-2 platform. The surge in wallet activity clearly demonstrates restored confidence in Shibarium and its potential to provide an ‚Äúenhanced user experience.‚Äù Moreover, the transaction count has rebounded significantly, recovering from a dip that saw daily transactions drop to 40,000 on August 27, after peaking at 132,000 on August 25. The resurgence, growing confidence, and surge in new wallets and daily transactions have made Shibarium an attractive option for retail investors seeking faster, more cost-effective, and private off-chain transactions while benefiting from the underlying security of the blockchain. After a difficult start, Shiba Inu delivered positive news by announcing the successful functionality of the highly anticipated Shibarium Bridge on August 28, 2023. This bridge facilitates seamless movement of funds from the Ethereum Layer-1 to the Layer-2 Shibarium platform, improving transaction speed and reducing fees. Shibarium initially encountered challenges upon its launch, experiencing significant user and transaction volumes that caused an ‚Äúoutage.‚Äù To tackle this issue, according to crypto influencer Keyur Rohit, Shytoshi Kusama, co-founder of SHIB, sought assistance from Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of Polygon Labs. Together, they resolved the problems, ensuring the safety of funds. Kusama expressed gratitude to Sandeep for his help. Notably, in the aftermath of the initial challenges, Shibarium undertook significant improvements. The team expanded their server infrastructure by an impressive 1500% to ‚Äúbetter handle‚Äù on-chain congestion. These corrective measures have resulted in rapid growth of the user base and an increase in the price of the SHIB token. Additionally, Shibarium has achieved a notable Total Value Locked (TVL) of $1.42 million. This achievement signifies a significant milestone and reflects the increasing enthusiasm within the Shiba Inu network. SHIB‚Äôs Uptrend At Risk? SHIB‚Äôs recent recovery and positive developments within its native ecosystem have failed to sustain the initial excitement, as the token‚Äôs price action has experienced a sharp decline. Over the past 24 hours, SHIB has lost more than 3% of its value, currently trading at $0.00000813. Adding to the concern is the token‚Äôs inability to surpass its 50-day Moving Average, as depicted by the brown line on the daily chart above. Since July 2023, when SHIB briefly surged to the $0.000001137 mark, it has struggled to break above this key moving average. Related Reading: Large Transactions Put XRP Price Under Pressure: Are Whales Making An Exit? However, there is a glimmer of hope if the overall market, particularly the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), paves the way for improved liquidity in the emerging sector. If SHIB manages to surpass this significant moving average, it could signal the potential for another strong uptrend, similar to the ones witnessed in July and January, during which the token reached its yearly high.

Grayscale's victory over the SEC could pave the way for the company to convert it into the first U.S. spot bitcoin ETF ‚Äì a shift that would permit redemptions of fund shares, making Alameda's suit unnecessary, litigation analysts from Bloomberg Intelligence said in a note on Wednesday. (Redemptions could allow the fund to remain more closely tied to the value of its underlying bitcoin holdings, something it's struggled to do for quite a while.)  ‚ÄúThe Grayscale court ruling probably shows that Alameda's attempt to unlock about $9 billion for Grayscale shareholders was premature and ultimate resolution of the issue may be prolonged,‚Äù the analysts wrote.

42409765,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcP7AP,1693427760,"Bitcoin Slips to $27.2K, Cryptos Dip as Investors Digest Grayscale‚Äôs Court Win","Bitcoin (BTC) pulled back from yesterday‚Äôs high above $28,000 on Wednesday as investors mulled the implications of Grayscale‚Äôs court victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  The largest cryptocurrency by market cap was down 2% over the past 24 hours to $27,240. Ether (ETH) slightly outperformed, sinking 1.7% in the past 24 hours and hovering just above $1,700..  The broader crypto market mirrored the two leading assets‚Äô move, with the CoinDesk Market Index dipping 2.4%.  Cardano‚Äôs ADA, Solana‚Äôs SOL and Polygon‚Äôs MATIC led the decline among major altcoins, falling near 4% during the day and erasing most of their Tuesday advance.  A federal appeals court yesterday ordered the SEC to review its rejection of investment manager Grayscale‚Äôs bid to convert its $14 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), spurring an immediate rally in digital asset prices and crypto-related stocks.  Market observers hailed the decision as a landmark win that could potentially pave the way for a spot BTC ETF in the future. During the summer, a flurry of investment firms applied or renewed their bid to list such a product, including traditional finance giant BlackRock. Still, yesterday‚Äôs ruling does not automatically guarantee an approval of Grayscale‚Äôs or any other firm‚Äôs application.  How sustainable is the BTC rally?  While it‚Äôs too early to tell how sustainable Tuesday‚Äôs price jump was, ‚Äúthere are some small signs that we could see a slight reversal,‚Äù Clara Medalie, director of research at Kaiko, said in an interview with CoinDeskTV.  Notably, the rally was accompanied by modest trading volumes on exchanges relative to other ‚Äúmini bull markets,‚Äù spiking only to a two-week high, Medalie said. Trading volume represents market participants‚Äô engagement in the market, she explained, thus the lackluster volume figure could signal some weakness behind the move.  However, average BTC buy orders jumped to the highest since June, suggesting activity from large investors, which Medalie evaluated as ‚Äúgood news.‚Äù  ‚ÄúA wave of ETF approvals could definitely be the bullish catalyst the crypto market needs right now,‚Äù she said, adding that ‚Äúwe are still in the middle of a tumultuous period for the industry with quite a few bankruptcies and lawsuits ongoing.‚Äù  Market analyst Garreth Soloway forecasted further downside for bitcoin‚Äôs price in case it fails to break decisively above the $28,000 level where it traded before mid-August sell-off.  ‚Äú$28,000 is the price level at which the BTC price broke down. It is not uncommon for price to retrace to that level after a correction,‚Äù he explained in an emailed note. ‚ÄúBTC is still most likely to break down from the current levels, and the longer BTC trades sideways, the further the probable price decline.‚Äù  The support level to watch is around $25,000, the price at which bitcoin sat in mid-June when Blackrock filed for a spot BTC ETF, Soloway added.",NEUTRAL,BTC | MATIC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MATIC | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/30/bitcoin-slips-to-272k-cryptos-dip-as-investors-digest-grayscales-court-win,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f474cb922bfd112d77e2b5ef1d645768804a6758-2400x1256.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409761,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcP73n,1693425793,"Save a Tree, Use Web3","In 2023, we find ourselves in a prime position to leverage cutting-edge technologies to confront and resolve some of the most critical environmental challenges of our era. The digital, decentralized paradigm of Web3 is no longer a distant future or an abstract concept, it's our present reality. And it's high time we exploit its full potential, especially in our ongoing fight against deforestation and related environmental issues.  Marc Johnson is an environmental solutions architect for Filecoin Green, a Protocol Labs initiative to decarbonize Filecoin and other Web3 networks.  One such issue is deforestation, a persistent global concern that has devastating consequences for climate change, biodiversity and indigenous communities. Recent legislation in the European Union mandates products sold in the shared market not contribute to deforestation anywhere in the world. That's a significant stride forward but it also raises complex challenges in terms of verification and compliance.  That's where Web3 technologies come in, offering a potentially game-changing solution.  Web3 technologies are generally known for their foundational role in cryptocurrencies, but they have far-reaching applications beyond finance. By using content-addressed data and decentralized data storage, these technologies can help ensure that every product, from cocoa to printed paper, entering or exiting a market can be traced back to its source. This would provide irrefutable evidence of a product's relationship to deforestation.  As such, Web3 technologies could be the key to helping companies comply with the new environmental regulations.  How would all this work? Imagine every product, say a bar of chocolate or a ream of paper, carrying a unique digital fingerprint, one that is registered on a blockchain-based system. This fingerprint contains information about the entire lifecycle of the product ‚Äî from the plantation where the raw materials were grown to the processes employed in its creation to its final point of sale.  The use of content-addressed data allows for the permanent recording of this information on a decentralized database. Unlike traditional databases that identify data based on its location, content-addressed storage identifies data based on its content. This method ensures data immutability, which is crucial in verifying a product's origins. A company or regulator could look at this digital fingerprint at any point and determine with certainty whether the product has contributed to deforestation.  Moreover, the decentralized nature of most Web3 technologies can help ensure this information is not subject to manipulation by any single party. The trustless and transparent nature of these systems could significantly reduce the risk of falsified information, a concern that has plagued traditional supply chain systems for years.  The great transition  It is vital to remember, however, that the successful implementation of this system will require widespread adoption across various sectors and stakeholder groups. Companies will need to transition from traditional supply chain systems to Web3-enabled ones, a task that could prove challenging given the inherent resistance to technological transformation.  Nevertheless, the benefits of Web3 technologies in easing this transition period should not be underestimated. By providing a robust system for data verification, a system based on content-addressed data could mitigate potential fines companies may face for non-compliance. For the new EU regulations, if a company fails to carry out quality controls, it could be fined up to 4% of its total annual turnover. A 4% loss of total annual turnover is a significant deterrent, making the investment in Web3 technologies an economically sound decision.  See also: Could Bitcoin Be the Greatest ESG Investment of All Time?  It is also worth noting that this system could aid in promoting responsible consumption. As consumers become more informed about the environmental impact of their purchases, they could make conscious choices to buy deforestation-free products. This would not only foster consumer trust but also incentivize companies to pursue more sustainable practices.  In summary, Web3 technologies (especially content-addressed data and decentralized data storage) with their unique blend of transparency, security and immutability, could prove to be the answer to the complexities of deforestation compliance. As the world moves towards more sustainable practices, it will need technology that can keep pace. With the appropriate adoption and investment, Web3 technologies could offer the solution.  It's time for stakeholders to recognize that Web3 technologies are not merely a speculative tool or a fleeting trend, but a powerful solution that could help safeguard our environment. By applying these technologies to challenges such as deforestation compliance, we are taking a significant step towards a more sustainable future.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIL | MARKET | REGULATION,Marc Johnson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/08/30/save-a-tree-use-web3,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a731838d74326c927dd4cf17cf2412c0df175b49-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Cardano & Litecoin Have Seen Most Growth In Long-Term Holders In a new post on X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has revealed data related to the long-term holders of the various assets in the sector. The ‚Äúlong-term holders‚Äù (LTHs) here refer to all those investors who bought their coins at least one year ago. These HODLers are generally the most committed hands in the market, as they rarely participate in any selling. This cohort doesn‚Äôt usually budge even when FUD has taken over the market or an enticing profit-taking opportunity has appeared. Because they keep their coins locked away for long periods, the LTHs can naturally affect the economics of any cryptocurrency (although their effects don‚Äôt appear during the short term). Related Reading: Renowned Economist Explains Why Grayscale‚Äôs Win Is Not Good For Bitcoin Price Now, here is an infographic from IntoTheBlock that shows the total number of LTH addresses present on the networks of some of the top assets in the sector, as well as their percentage changes during the past year: Looks like Chainlink is the only one who has observed a decline in this metric | Source: IntoTheBlock As displayed above, the number one ranked cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), currently has 33.6 million LTH addresses, reflecting an increase of 17.6% during the past twelve months. Despite its lower market cap, Ethereum (ETH) has BTC beat in this metric, as the number of LTHs on the chain is, interestingly, around 73.9 million, more than double what BTC has. The network has also observed a sharper growth in this indicator at about 44.2%. This is also even though Bitcoin is also much older, meaning that it would have been able to accumulate more LTHs over the years in the form of lost coins, as such addresses would also fall under this category (although they certainly don‚Äôt carry the same meaning as an investor willingly choosing to HODL). While these largest coins have seen some decent increases in the number of LTHs, Litecoin (LTC) has them very easily beaten with its 100% growth, implying that HODLers on the blockchain have doubled during the past year. LTC is still far behind in terms of the pure number of LTHs, as the network hosts just 4.9 million. Cardano, however, has complete victory over even LTC‚Äôs rapid growth, as the coin has seen LTHs go up by more than 170% in this period. This astonishing rise has taken ADA‚Äôs total HODLer count to 2.65 million. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Signal: Exchange Netflow Remains Negative Chainlink (LINK) appears to be the only cryptocurrency in the table that has seen an adverse change in its number of LTHs, as the asset‚Äôs HODLers have decreased by about 3%.

16742913,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549469,1693422027,XRP Poised For Bullish Breakout: Inverted Hammer Formation Signals Rise Above $0.8 Resistance,"After the initial excitement surrounding Ripple Lab‚Äôs partial legal victory against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) subsided, XRP experienced a decline that led it to test its 4-month support line at $0.4240. However, the cryptocurrency has demonstrated resilience by reclaiming its important psychological level of $0.50 and reentering its previous consolidation or accumulation zone. This renewed stability has sparked optimism among bullish investors, indicating a potential rebound for XRP. Presently, XRP is trading at $0.5295 with a 24-hour trade volume of $1,419,623,015.56. This reflects a 1.89% increase in price over the last 24 hours and a 1.60% increase over the past 7 days. These gains and a promising chart formation suggest that XRP may be poised for further growth in the days and months ahead. Potential XRP Breakout As 2-Month Candle Nears Conclusion Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto, known for insightful market analysis, recently took to the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to highlight an intriguing development in the XRP market. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Prediction for 2023, 2024, 2025, 2030 and Beyond As the two-month candle for XRP draws to a close, it displays the potential formation of an inverted hammer pattern. For further context, the inverted hammer is a technical analysis candlestick pattern that typically appears at the end of a downtrend. It is characterized by a small body at the candle‚Äôs upper end, with a long upper shadow and little to no lower shadow. The inverted hammer pattern suggests a potential reversal in price direction. It indicates that buyers have stepped in after a period of selling pressure, causing the price to bounce back from its lows. As seen in Egrag‚Äôs chart above, throughout 426 days, XRP has demonstrated remarkable resilience, maintaining its market structure and solidifying its foundation amidst market fluctuations. On this note, Egrag further claimed: The chart unequivocally illustrates this trend, consistent with my earlier analyses wherein I underlined the significance of the 0.80c mark as a pivotal macro resistance level. Establishing this price range as a foundation marks a highly bullish macro stance. Notably, per the information compiled by the analyst, this consolidation around the mentioned price range indicates a highly bullish macro stance for XRP Egrag Crypto predicts a scenario where the upcoming candle could propel XRP towards the $2.3 range. However, this achievement would merely serve as a stepping stone within a larger macro range of $3.3 to $5.5, signaling a seamless continuation of XRP‚Äôs upward trajectory. Egrag Crypto‚Äôs symbolic reference to Valhalla beyond the $5.5 threshold reflects the analyst‚Äôs belief in the substantial potential for XRP‚Äôs future growth. While these words evoke a sense of grandeur, they emphasize the possibility of XRP reaching unprecedented heights in the market. Amidst growing anticipation within the crypto community, all eyes are on the impending conclusion of the two-month candle, which holds the key to a potential breakout indicated by the inverted hammer formation.

42409785,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcPI6E,1693421058,"Sam Bankman-Fried Lawyers ‚ÄòNeed‚Äô Him Out Of Jail Ahead of Trial, They Tell Judge","Sam Bankman-Fried‚Äôs criminal defense team failed to win any major concessions Wednesday in a hearing that focused on his claimed difficulties in preparing for his October trial from the confines of a Brooklyn lockup.  The former FTX CEO, who was sent to New York City‚Äôs Metropolitan Detention Center after his bail was revoked earlier this month, has limited internet access and subpar laptop tech specs to sift through the mountain of pretrial evidence, his lawyers argued. They pushed for their client to be released from jail in order to prepare his defense.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just the fact of the reality that we haven‚Äôt been able to make effective use of our client‚Äôs time,‚Äù one of Bankman-Fried‚Äôs lawyers, Christian Everdell, said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre at that point ‚Äì we need‚Äù him to be released.  But the federal judge overseeing his case, Judge Lewis Kaplan of the Southern District of New York, was unpersuaded Wednesday and declined to grant them their biggest ask. Instead, he gave both parties until next Tuesday to brief him on the conditions in Brooklyn‚Äôs MDC facility so that he could decide whether to grant Bankman-Fried temporary release.  Held over teleconference, the relatively speedy hearing also saw Judge Kaplan reject other major requests put forward by the defense. When they told him the government was dumping millions of discovery documents on them weeks ahead of the trial ‚Äì at a time when their locked-up client could not actually review the material ‚Äì he denied their request to preclude all documents produced after July 1.  Judge Kaplan said the defense could ask to postpone the start of the trial if they wanted more time to review, even though there is no guarantee that he would grant such a motion. However, they would have to do so before Sept 7, which is when the jury selection process would start. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm simply putting all the cards on the table,‚Äù he said. Earlier in the hearing the defense said it was not interested in a delay.  Jailhouse blues  During the call the defense, Judge Kaplan and prosecution took turns sparring over the conditions in MDC, including Bankman-Fried‚Äôs laptop‚Äôs battery life and internet access. The government said it was making every effort to fix Bankman-Fried‚Äôs jailhouse tech dilemmas, but the defense pushed back, arguing their ‚Äúsolutions do not pan out in practice.‚Äù  At one point, Judge Kaplan proposed to fix Bankman-Fried‚Äôs battery woes (his laptop cannot hold a charge) with a seemingly obvious solution: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs called an extension cord.‚Äù But federal prosecutors said the Bureau of Prisons would not let an extension cord into the jail for security and safety reasons.  Bankman-Fried was jailed in early August for attempted witness tampering. At the time, Judge Kaplan said the 31-year-old defendant was ‚Äúwilling to risk crossing the line‚Äù and revoked his bail, an uncommon move in criminal proceedings. He‚Äôs been in Brooklyn‚Äôs Metropolitan Detention Center ever since.  Last Friday, his attorney filed a motion asking for a temporary release ahead of trial or alternatively, to allow Bankman-Fried to meet with his defense team five days a week, arguing that it is his constitutional right to have a fair trial.  His defense team argued that him being in jail would interfere with his ‚Äúright to participate in his own defense.‚Äù They also requested access to a laptop and internet in order to review documents ahead of trial. In filings ahead of the hearing, defense attorney Christian Everdell argued that the laptop currently provided didn‚Äôt have a powerful enough battery to last through an entire review session, and the internet connection was too weak to be of much service.  Prosecutors said they shared information about the laptop battery with defense counsel to allow them to purchase a replacement, saying the government procurement process would take too long. The internet issues would be more difficult to resolve because the cell block was not designed to allow for 5G internet access, assistant U.S. attorney Danielle Kudla told the judge.

42409789,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcPIdI,1693418721,"The Protocol: Friend.tech Fades as Crypto Craze, but Ethereum Is Scaling","Last week in The Protocol, we talked about the frenzy that was happening on the Friend.tech app, atop Coinbase‚Äôs Base blockchain ‚Äì and made the point that, like a lot of crypto crazes, it might pass quickly. That appears to be happening now.  But there is a lesson here from looking at Ethereum fees ‚Äì that the largest smart-contracts blockchain‚Äôs plan for scaling via the addition of supplemental ‚Äúlayer-2‚Äù networks might be paying off. Lyllah Ledesma has the feature.  You're reading The Protocol, CoinDesk‚Äôs weekly newsletter that explores the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Subscribe here to get it every week.  Network news  Activity has slumped on the Friend.tech platform ‚Äúas quickly as it rose,‚Äù according to the analysis firm Messari. (Messari)  FICKLE FRIEND.TECH: The social marketplace Friend.tech, which went viral after being launched a few weeks ago on Coinbase‚Äôs new Base blockchain, is now at risk of being discarded as the latest crypto has-been. According to a Dune Analytics dashboard, the number of buys and sells on the platform plunged in the past week along with prices for shares or keys in listed influencers. The analysis firm Messari, in a report titled, ‚ÄúAn End to the Friendzy,‚Äù estimated that the number of traders was down 40% off their peak, and users complained of high feeds and slow load times. ‚ÄúAs quickly as it rose, activity on Friend.tech has cooled off,‚Äù according to the firm. There might be a second act, however: Decrypt reported that creators of adult (and often explicit) content from the website OnlyFans were flocking over to the Friend.tech platform, after it enabled the sending of photos to ‚Äúkey holders.‚Äù  BINANCE BUZZ: There‚Äôs been a lot of news over the past week on the big U.S. crypto exchange ‚Äì some of it good, some not so good, some neutral. The overarching theme is that the company expanded rapidly in recent years, and now it‚Äôs facing intense scrutiny from regulators, having to retrench in some business lines and regions, while pivoting in others. Binance this week cut ties with five sanctioned Russian banks listed on the exchange‚Äôs peer-to-peer service for transferring funds in rubles. The move came just days after the Wall Street Journal reported that Binance was enabling peer-to-peer trades of rubles for digital tokens, frequently involving banks on Western blacklists ‚Äì a popular method for Russians to transfer money abroad. Binance said it was discontinuing its crypto-backed debit card in Bahrain and Latin America, where it has been available for less than a year. According to Reuters, Mastercard decided to end the programs. Then on Tuesday, Binance announced it had launched a new crypto-based program Send Cash that will allow users in nine Latin American countries to transfer money directly into friends‚Äô and family members‚Äô bank accounts in Colombia and Argentina. In Belgium, Binance has been ordered to cease operations by the country‚Äôs local regulator, but customers can continue using the exchange via a Polish entity. On the trading side, Binance announced that, starting Wednesday, it would offer ‚ÄúT+3‚Äù daily options contracts allowing traders to bet on the BNB token over a three-day period. The BNB token has been volatile this year, falling recently to a one-year low (get update on this). Market observers have long speculated that Binance might attempt to prop up the token‚Äôs value by selling bitcoin (BTC), but exchange CEO Changpeng ‚ÄúCZ‚Äù Zhao has said it wasn‚Äôt the case. Binance and Zhao were sued by the SEC in June, accused of offering unregistered securities to the general public allowing for commingling of customer funds, along with other violations of securities laws. ByteTree, a research firm, wrote this week that Binance was ‚Äúin the crosshairs,‚Äù adding that its share of global crypto exchange trading volume has slid to about 45%, from 64% six months earlier.  Bitstamp said it would shut down its ether staking service in the U.S. as of Sept. 25 due to regulatory scrutiny of the practice, which the Securities and Exchange Commission has likened to investment contracts. The crypto exchange Kraken agreed in February to end its staking-as-a-service platform for U.S. customers and pay $30 million to settle SEC allegations it offered unregistered securities.  Magnate Finance, a lending and borrowing platform on Coinbase‚Äôs new Base blockchain, appears to have rug-pulled users out of $6.5 million, just hours after the blockchain sleuth ZachXBT warned on X (Twitter) that the project might be a scam ‚Äì based on data records tying Magnate to an earlier $4.8 million exit scam known as Solfire, Cointelegraph reported.  Will crypto ever be rid of influencers like BitBoy?  Protocol Village  Highlighting blockchain tech upgrades and developments.  Polygon, the Ethereum scaling firm, is releasing a toolkit for developers to help them build blockchains fueled by zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs. The Chain Development Kit (CDK) is an open-source codebase that developers can use to create their own customizable layer 2 chains using Polygon‚Äôs ZK technology.  Shibarium, new layer-2 blockchain atop Ethereum for Shiba Inu community and its SHIB coin, plans to reopen the network after its much-hyped launch was marred by network issues and a faulty bridge.  Farcaster, a protocol for decentralized social apps including the Twitter-like Warpcast (where Ethereum‚Äôs Vitalik Buterin sometimes posts), moved to Optimism‚Äôs OP Mainnet from Goerli Ethereum testnet.  Token withdrawals out of the Shibarium bridge are now live and available to users, weeks after a much-hyped launch quickly fizzled out after being riddled with software bugs that led to millions of dollars in limbo on the network. Shibarium is an Ethereum layer-2 network, created via a fork of Polygon, that uses SHIB tokens as fees in what is part of a broader plan to position Shiba Inu as a serious blockchain project.  The team behind Interlay, a decentralized network designed to provide DeFi tooling for Bitcoin, announced plans for BOB, a new Bitcoin layer-2 network compatible with Ethereum‚Äôs EVM software environment, ‚Äúfeaturing Rust smart contracts compatible with Bitcoin libraries such as Lightning and Ordinals.‚Äù  Pancake Swap, a decentralized exchange, has expanded to the Ethereum layer-2 blockchain Linea, from the big Ethereum developer Consensys. PancakeSwap was already available on Ethereum, BNB Chain, Aptos, Polygon zkEVM, zkSync Era and Arbitrum.  Money Center  Deals and grants  Prime Trust, the beleaguered crypto custodian, detailed in a bankruptcy-court filing how it came to be in such a deep financial hole, including investing some $6 million of client funds in the Terra blockchain project‚Äôs failed UST stablecoin, in addition to $2 million of funds from its own treasury. The company also inadvertently provided customers with addresses where they could contribute cryptocurrency into a muti-signature wallet, known as 98f, before later realizing that it couldn‚Äôt gain access to the wallet; so employees reportedly had to use some $76.4 million of fiat currency from the company‚Äôs accounts to satisfy ETH withdrawal requests.  Binance Labs wrote in a blog post that it has invested in Delphinus Lab, an infrastructure provider that is ‚Äúleading the zkWASM space, where zero-knowledge (ZK) cryptography is deployed in WebAssembly (WASM) environments.‚Äù  Wintermute Trading, one of the biggest market makers in crypto, is trying and failing to convince supporters of Yearn Finance to loan it 350 YFI tokens ‚Äì worth over $2 million, with no collateral posted ‚Äì in exchange for Wintermute supporting markets for Yearn‚Äôs yCRV token. Yearn voters are roundly rejecting the advances as extremely unfair.  Data and tokens  The bitcoin (BTC) price surged after a federal appeals court ruled that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) must review its rejection of Grayscale Investments' attempt to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF.  The meme coin PEPE plunged in price after blockchain analysts noted that the project had changed the rules of its multi-signature wallet so that only two out of eight addresses had to sign off to effect a transaction, instead of five. Right after the change happened, some 16 trillion tokens (about $14M worth) flowed out of the PEPE wallet, heading to addresses associated with the crypto exchanges Binance, OKX and Bybit. Late Friday, the twitter user @pepecoineth posted an explanation on X, noting that the project has ‚Äúunfortunately been plagued by inner strife‚Äù since inception, ‚Äúwith a portion of the team being bad actors led by big egos and greed.‚Äù The user said that the ‚Äúmulti-sig was set up to require 3/4 signers present for an approval,‚Äù and that the a theft of tokens occurred after ‚ÄúYesterday these 3 ex-team members came back behind my back.‚Äù The user apologized and said the remaining 10 trillion tokens are safe.  THORChain, a cross-chain liquidity protocol built using Cosmos software, saw the price of its native token RUNE surge as wealthy investors seeking alternatives to centralized exchanges used the platform to conduct multi-million dollar token swaps and tried a new ‚Äústreaming swaps‚Äù product that debuted in early August, The Defiant reported.  Hedera‚Äôs HBAR Dominates August Returns Among Smart-Contract Platform tokens  Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, is up 44% in 2023, but August has not been a strong month. The CoinDesk Smart Contract Platform Index (SMT), which includes Ethereum as well as projects like Optimism and Algorand, is down roughly 10% so far this month. The most notable outlier is Hedera Hashgraph‚Äôs HBAR, which shot up in price after the U.S. Federal Reserve‚Äôs instant payments platform FedNow added ""Dropp,"" a Hedera-based micropayments platform, as a service provider. The HBAR token was sitting on a 10% gain for August.  Calendar  Sept. 11-13: Permissionless II conference, Austin, Texas.  Sept. 13-14: Token2049, Singapore.

Following this, Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC shares trading volume significantly increased, climbing to a 2-year high in the process. GBTC Shares See 17% Increase According to data from Yahoo Finance, GBTC‚Äôs share price had opened at $17.66 on the day and closed at $20.56, rising by almost 17% from the previous day. Furthermore, the fund saw its busiest day in over a year, with over 19 million GBTC shares changing hands. This volume jump marked the fund‚Äôs highest in over two years. Related Reading: Bitcoin Insider Trading Suspicions Take Root Following Grayscale Win, What‚Äôs Happening? These figures aren‚Äôt surprising, considering that Grayscale‚Äôs victory presents a bullish outlook for the fund. Furthermore, Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC is one step closer to being converted into a Spot Bitcoin ETF, so many investors may want to get in on the fund at a discounted price. GBTC currently operates as a closed-end fund and has seen a discount as high as 48.89% of its net asset value (NAV) in December 2022. This discount has been reduced to about 18% following the court‚Äôs ruling in favor of Grayscale. However, some still believe this gap could close further, especially if Grayscale‚Äôs ETF application were approved. Share price rises 17% in one day | Source: Grayscale Bitcoin Trust on Tradingview.com Big Win For The Crypto Community Grayscale had filed a lawsuit following the SEC‚Äôs refusal to grant its application to convert its GBTC fund into a Spot Bitcoin ETF. Grayscale argued that the SEC acted arbitrarily and capriciously by not giving it the same regulatory treatment the Commission did to the Teucrium Bitcoin Futures Fund and the Valkyrie XBTO Bitcoin Futures Fund. The fund stated that it deserved the same treatment as the Bitcoin futures fund because the prices of both Spot and Futures Bitcoin ETFs were ‚Äú99.9%‚Äù correlated, so they posed the same risk regarding fraud and manipulation. The court adopted Grayscale‚Äôs argument and agreed that the SEC had not provided sufficient reason for denying Grayscale‚Äôs application while approving the Bitcoin futures funds. Related Reading: Renowned Economist Explains Why Grayscale‚Äôs Win Is Not Good For Bitcoin Price With this ruling, the SEC‚Äôs primary reason for not approving a Spot Bitcoin no longer carries weight, as the Commission can no longer deny applications solely because the Spot Bitcoin market has no regulated market of significant size. The court already found both funds (spot and futures) to be similar, so these exchanges‚Äô surveillance sharing agreements with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) should be sufficient to deter manipulation in either the spot or futures market. While it remains to be seen what step the SEC will take regarding the Court of Appeal‚Äôs ruling, there is an increased likelihood that the Commission will have to approve the pending Spot Bitcoin ETF applications except if it can find another reason to deny these proposals.

According to data from Kaiko, the average trade size for bitcoin on crypto exchange Kraken increased to above $2,000 on Tuesday after the ruling, from around $850 the day prior. The last time bitcoin‚Äôs average trade size was higher than $2,168 was in June, said research firm Kaiko. The bitcoin average trade size also jumped on most other exchanges.  ‚ÄúThis could suggest large traders are more active,‚Äù said Dessislava Aubert, an analyst at Kaiko.  As the market's confidence in a bitcoin spot ETF approval increased, the price of bitcoin climbed more than 7%, topping $28,000 at one point on Tuesday afternoon after the Grayscale news broke. The price has since pulled to just above $27,900.  ‚ÄúThis is one of the largest hourly moves since Terra (the other one was the Aug 17 selloff). This is partly due to low liquidity,‚Äù said Aubert. ‚ÄúFor now, overall volumes did not spike that much and are at their highest level since the Aug 17 selloff.""

If approved, it is widely believed the NAV discount in GBTC and possibly other Grayscale funds will re-rate closer to collateral value. Applying a discount adjustment to GDLC shares just based on current ETHE and GBTC discount rates implies 23% upside in GDLC. Grayscale has won its lawsuit with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. In a ruling on August 29th, a panel of judges vacated the agency's ETF rejection and the application for a conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) is back on the table: The Commission failed to adequately explain why it approved the listing of two Bitcoin futures ETPs but not Grayscale's proposed Bitcoin ETP. In the absence of a coherent explanation, this unlike regulatory treatment of like products is unlawful. We therefore grant Grayscale's petition for review and vacate the Commission's order The response from Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), GBTC, and just about every crypto-proxy public equity since the ruling can best be described as ""elevator up."" At the end of the August 29th session, the NAV discount in GBTC closed at 18% - which is the closest GBTC shares have been to NAV since December 2021. GBTC Nav Discount (CoinGlass) When I last covered GBTC for Seeking Alpha in early August, I explained why I believed the tea leaves were indicating a sentiment shift toward Bitcoin in traditional finance and that the positions of regulators like the SEC were losing in court. This ruling reaffirms that belief. Keeping It In Perspective While this court ruling for Grayscale is a very good sign, I do think it's important to point out that GBTC is not actually approved for ETF conversion yet. But I'll reiterate that I do believe GBTC will ultimately be approved for conversion and likely in close proximity to approvals of spot Bitcoin ETF applications from other institutions like BlackRock ( BLK ). With that as my base case, I'm not personally fading the broad rally in the Grayscale funds like GBTC or Grayscale's Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ). Back in late June, I hypothesized that the better play for NAV arbitrage in the event of a Grayscale GBTC conversion may actually be the Grayscale Digital Large Cap ( GDLC) fund. I continue to believe that to be true and have added to my long GDLC position since that article was published. Meat On The Bone The core thesis from that June article was that the GDLC fund's allocation methodology is so poor, that it makes GDLC an interesting arbitrage option for crypto traders. At the time, the fund shares traded at a staggering 50% discount to net asset value. Given the fund's current 38% discount to NAV as of article submission, there has been improvement, but I believe there is still plenty of meat left on the bone here for traders who may feel they have missed the GBTC trade. GDLC Allocation (Grayscale) The core purpose of GDLC is to offer investors a diversified approach to digital assets. In the past, the fund has had as many as ten different holdings. However, given what I've previously criticized for what I believe to be a poor fund methodology, GDLC shares have become almost entirely dominated by Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ). Bitcoin now makes up 70% of GDLC shares, with Ethereum commanding another 27%. This means the remaining fund components make up just 3% of GDLC shares. From where I sit, this makes GDLC a Bitcoin and Ethereum fund, practically speaking. Since Grayscale's GBTC and ETHE shares trade at smaller discounts to NAV than GDLC shares despite having very similar collateral, I calculated a discount adjustment for the GDLC shares that I felt represented fair value based on how Grayscale's larger funds were trading. Even after GBTC's discount arb has moved from 30% to 18% and ETHE's has gone from 45% to 30% since that time, GDLC still has quite a bit of catching up to do if we priced it the way Grayscale's other funds are priced: GDLC Assets AUM Discount Adjustment Asset Value BTC $171,190,423 18% $140,376,147 ETH $66,416,480 30% $46,491,536 Adjusted Discount Market Cap $186,867,683 Adjusted share price $11.78 Source: Author Calculations based on Grayscale AUM and outstanding share data In the table above, the adjusted share price is applying the 30% ETHE discount to the ETH portion of the GDLC shares and the 18% discount to the BTC portion of the GDLC shares. Again, even if we choose to be aggressive and zero out the balances of the three altcoins that are also held in the fund, GDLC shares should be trading closer to $12 than $10. Risks The same risks apply to this trade when I first mentioned it earlier this summer. Crypto is arguably the riskiest of the many risk asset classes. If the value of the collateral that is held by Grayscale for the GDLC shares declines, the price of GDLC shares will almost certainly decline as well. Furthermore, while advantageous for traders who wish to minimize tax liability, Grayscale's funds are not the same thing as self-storing crypto and shouldn't be viewed as real ownership as long as redemptions aren't possible. There is also related party risk as Grayscale's parent company and sister companies own roughly 8% of the fund shares outstanding all while there are still ongoing financial issues between Digital Currency Group, Genesis Global, and Genesis's creditors. An additional risk is my thesis could simply be wrong and the NAV discount in GDLC could move against arb traders and return back to the 50% level or lower. Finally, there is no guarantee that GBTC or any other Grayscale fund will end up being converted to spot ETFs even with the recent court ruling against the SEC.

If approved, it is widely believed the NAV discount in GBTC and possibly other Grayscale funds will re-rate closer to collateral value. Applying a discount adjustment to GDLC shares just based on current ETHE and GBTC discount rates implies 23% upside in GDLC. Grayscale has won its lawsuit with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. In a ruling on August 29th, a panel of judges vacated the agency's ETF rejection and the application for a conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) is back on the table: The Commission failed to adequately explain why it approved the listing of two Bitcoin futures ETPs but not Grayscale's proposed Bitcoin ETP. In the absence of a coherent explanation, this unlike regulatory treatment of like products is unlawful. We therefore grant Grayscale's petition for review and vacate the Commission's order The response from Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), GBTC, and just about every crypto-proxy public equity since the ruling can best be described as ""elevator up."" At the end of the August 29th session, the NAV discount in GBTC closed at 18% - which is the closest GBTC shares have been to NAV since December 2021. GBTC Nav Discount (CoinGlass) When I last covered GBTC for Seeking Alpha in early August, I explained why I believed the tea leaves were indicating a sentiment shift toward Bitcoin in traditional finance and that the positions of regulators like the SEC were losing in court. This ruling reaffirms that belief. Keeping It In Perspective While this court ruling for Grayscale is a very good sign, I do think it's important to point out that GBTC is not actually approved for ETF conversion yet. But I'll reiterate that I do believe GBTC will ultimately be approved for conversion and likely in close proximity to approvals of spot Bitcoin ETF applications from other institutions like BlackRock ( BLK ). With that as my base case, I'm not personally fading the broad rally in the Grayscale funds like GBTC or Grayscale's Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ). Back in late June, I hypothesized that the better play for NAV arbitrage in the event of a Grayscale GBTC conversion may actually be the Grayscale Digital Large Cap ( GDLC) fund. I continue to believe that to be true and have added to my long GDLC position since that article was published. Meat On The Bone The core thesis from that June article was that the GDLC fund's allocation methodology is so poor, that it makes GDLC an interesting arbitrage option for crypto traders. At the time, the fund shares traded at a staggering 50% discount to net asset value. Given the fund's current 38% discount to NAV as of article submission, there has been improvement, but I believe there is still plenty of meat left on the bone here for traders who may feel they have missed the GBTC trade. GDLC Allocation (Grayscale) The core purpose of GDLC is to offer investors a diversified approach to digital assets. In the past, the fund has had as many as ten different holdings. However, given what I've previously criticized for what I believe to be a poor fund methodology, GDLC shares have become almost entirely dominated by Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ). Bitcoin now makes up 70% of GDLC shares, with Ethereum commanding another 27%. This means the remaining fund components make up just 3% of GDLC shares. From where I sit, this makes GDLC a Bitcoin and Ethereum fund, practically speaking. Since Grayscale's GBTC and ETHE shares trade at smaller discounts to NAV than GDLC shares despite having very similar collateral, I calculated a discount adjustment for the GDLC shares that I felt represented fair value based on how Grayscale's larger funds were trading. Even after GBTC's discount arb has moved from 30% to 18% and ETHE's has gone from 45% to 30% since that time, GDLC still has quite a bit of catching up to do if we priced it the way Grayscale's other funds are priced: GDLC Assets AUM Discount Adjustment Asset Value BTC $171,190,423 18% $140,376,147 ETH $66,416,480 30% $46,491,536 Adjusted Discount Market Cap $186,867,683 Adjusted share price $11.78 Source: Author Calculations based on Grayscale AUM and outstanding share data In the table above, the adjusted share price is applying the 30% ETHE discount to the ETH portion of the GDLC shares and the 18% discount to the BTC portion of the GDLC shares. Again, even if we choose to be aggressive and zero out the balances of the three altcoins that are also held in the fund, GDLC shares should be trading closer to $12 than $10. Risks The same risks apply to this trade when I first mentioned it earlier this summer. Crypto is arguably the riskiest of the many risk asset classes. If the value of the collateral that is held by Grayscale for the GDLC shares declines, the price of GDLC shares will almost certainly decline as well. Furthermore, while advantageous for traders who wish to minimize tax liability, Grayscale's funds are not the same thing as self-storing crypto and shouldn't be viewed as real ownership as long as redemptions aren't possible. There is also related party risk as Grayscale's parent company and sister companies own roughly 8% of the fund shares outstanding all while there are still ongoing financial issues between Digital Currency Group, Genesis Global, and Genesis's creditors. An additional risk is my thesis could simply be wrong and the NAV discount in GDLC could move against arb traders and return back to the 50% level or lower. Finally, there is no guarantee that GBTC or any other Grayscale fund will end up being converted to spot ETFs even with the recent court ruling against the SEC. There are other ways the agency could theoretically deny applications using different justifications from what has historically been used. Summary In early August, I closed my GBTC article with this: There has been a noticeable shift in sentiment toward the regulatory environment in the United States. Traditional financial firms like BlackRock and PayPal ( PYPL ) are now doing things that the SEC has previously indicated were problematic from more crypto-native businesses just a few months ago.

The EU's central bank digital currency has proved controversial, and draft laws include privacy controls.  German lawmaker Stefan Berger will take the lead in new legislation to underpin a digital euro, the member of the European Parliament (MEP) said Wednesday.  The center-right Berger already shepherded the EU‚Äôs landmark Markets in Crypto Assets regulation through the Parliament, and will now take a similar role on the central bank digital currency (CBDC) on which many of his colleagues have proved skeptical.  ‚ÄúHaving your own digital currency makes the EU more independent of non-EU countries and is part of the digital age,‚Äù Berger said on X (previously Twitter). ‚ÄúHowever, the project will only succeed if you can trust the digital euro just as much as you can trust cash.‚Äù  The European Central Bank has not yet taken a formal decision whether to issue the CBDC, but has invested significant resources in technical planning for it.  The European Parliament, alongside EU national governments who meet in a body called the Council, will have to agree on laws to underpin the currency in areas such as data protection, and ECB officials have also indicated that their decision will be swayed by the political mood in the Parliament.  Berger has usually been seen as pro-crypto, opposing a plan to limit energy use by proof-of-work technology that some saw as a ban on bitcoin. As rapporteur, Berger will propose amendments to the draft law that other lawmakers can themselves amend and vote on. In a later phase, he will lead negotiations with the Council to thrash out a unified version of the text.  Despite Berger‚Äôs relatively bullish tone, many members of the European Parliament have proved skeptical over the benefits of a digital euro ‚Äì including Markus Ferber, who is the economic spokesperson for Berger‚Äôs own political group.  In emailed comments made to CoinDesk in July, Michiel Hoogeveen, a Dutch MEP who will lead negotiations for the European Conservatives and Reformists political grouping, said he opposed the plans.  The digital euro ‚Äúis a solution looking for a problem and potentially only causes problems ‚Ä¶ it will only cause confusion amongst consumers and could undermine confidence in financial systems,‚Äù Hoogeveen said, although he acknowledged his party might not have enough votes to reject the plans outright. ‚ÄúWe'll at least try to adjust it and I will try my utmost to address the concerns of citizens.‚Äù  Commission officials have said the CBDC is needed to stimulate innovation amid geopolitical tensions, and have proposed that it should be usable offline in a way similar to cash.

16737331,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549405,1693411236,"$28,100 Next Level To Break For Bitcoin, Here‚Äôs Why","On-chain data suggests the $28,100 level could be the next major resistance to break for Bitcoin if history is anything to go by. Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Cost Basis Is Valued At $28,100 Currently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC price has recently neared the short-term holders‚Äô realized price. The ‚Äúrealized price‚Äù is a metric that basically represents the cost basis (that is, the buying price) of the average investor in the Bitcoin market. When the spot price of the asset dips below this indicator, the majority of the holders go underwater, while breaks above the level naturally result in the average investor moving into a state of profit. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Signal: Exchange Netflow Remains Negative In the context of the current discussion, the realized price for only a segment of the cryptocurrency‚Äôs user base is of interest; namely, the ‚Äúshort-term holders‚Äù (STHs). The STHs include all investors who have been holding onto their coins since less than 155 days ago. This cohort is one of the two main groups in the BTC market; the other one being the ‚Äúlong-term holders‚Äù (LTHs). The STHs are generally the more fickle investors, who easily react to changes in the wider market (like crashes or rallies), while the LTHs tend to stay silent regardless of the wider sentiment. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin realized price for both of these groups over the last few years: The asset's price seems to have come near the indicator's value in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the BTC spot price has surged closer to the STH realized price with the cryptocurrency‚Äôs latest rally following the news of the Grayscale victory. Historically, the retests of this level have been very often significant for the cryptocurrency, as they have generally set the tone for what trend the asset could follow in the near future. During bullish periods, the cost basis of the STHs usually provides support to the price, while the coin may encounter resistance at the line during bearish regimes. This pattern can also be seen working in action during this year‚Äôs rally, as Bitcoin found support at the line during the retests in both March and June. With the recent crash, however, Bitcoin finally plunged under the level. Related Reading: Ethereum In Bleak Situation? Sharks & Whales Continue 4-Month Long Selloff It‚Äôs possible that a return toward a bear market has now occurred because of this failed retest. Currently, the Bitcoin STH realized price is valued at about $28,100, which is actually the highest BTC has gone during the latest surge. Since Bitcoin has observed a pullback, it‚Äôs possible that it‚Äôs because of the resistance that the STH cost basis provided. If BTC continues to surge in the coming days, another retest of this level might be one to watch for, as a rejection might confirm a bearish transition. A successful break, however, could suggest that the bullish momentum isn‚Äôt dead just yet. BTC Price Following the latest surge, Bitcoin is now trading around the $27,400 mark, with investors being in 6% profits over the past week.

42409787,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcPIZz,1693410300,A Guide to TradFi Blockchain Adoption,"As decentralized finance, or DeFi, continues to evolve and mature, the concept of total value locked ‚Äì a measure of how much money users have stashed in a given protocol ‚Äì has also gained significant attention. Originally focused on digital assets such as cryptocurrencies, TVL has expanded to include tokenized real-world assets (RWA), providing a more comprehensive understanding of the assets represented on-chain. These tokenized assets are typically held in smart contracts on a blockchain network.  Since RWA, such as mortgages, private equity investments and illiquid funds, have not been historically represented on-chain, TVL primarily focused on the value of digital assets deposited within DeFi protocols. However, as blockchain technology adoption by traditional financial institutions progresses, the inclusion of RWA, measured within the TVL framework, becomes increasingly relevant and necessary. This is a natural progression in line with the continued development of the DeFi ecosystem, which is coming to embrace tokenized RWAs as part of TVL. Moreover, as DeFi platforms attract institutions and large-scale investors (which are vital for scaling), it becomes increasingly attractive to offer the ability to trade tokenized bonds, equity, debt and other assets such as gold, real estate and art.  You‚Äôre reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  While integrating RWAs into the TVL metric is still in its early stages, with only about $300 billion locked on-chain, the current state of the blockchain layer-1 and layer-2 landscape shows the following figures representing TVL as of July 2023.  Most blockchains‚Äô TVL is largely representative of digital assets, such as cryptocurrency and NFTs, although there are a select few notable blockchains whose TVLs are heavily weighted to RWAs. A great example is Provenance Blockchain, which has an overall TVL of $9.3 billion, of which more than $8.1 billion is from real-world financial assets, such as home equity line of credit (HELOC) loans, private equity and alternative asset funds. RWAs are gradually making their way onto the blockchain, further expanding the TVL metric and its significance.  Importance of TVL to TradFi  As financial and insurance services lean into blockchain-based solutions through tokenized RWA, the RWA TVL metric becomes an important indicator of what blockchain to tokenize assets on. Multiple factors are involved in selecting a blockchain to tokenize RWAs on, such as which blockchain has the most robust tooling for easy onboarding and lifecycle management of financial assets, an ability to achieve compliance and privacy standards and a function to achieve security and scalability requirements.  Perhaps the leading indicators of the above are:  Where the majority of tokenized financial assets exist today.  Where the momentum of RWA tokenization is occurring.  By identifying a blockchain‚Äôs current RWA TVL and TVL growth over time, an institution can assess these questions and ultimately select the most appropriate blockchain platform to support transactions in tokenized RWAs. The blockchains with the greatest gravitas, as indicated by real-world financial asset TVL, are probabilistically also best positioned as a long-term sustainable solution for institutions seeking greater transparency, efficiency and productivity.  As with any new data set, the challenge to date has been that RWA TVL data is not readily available and rarely segmented by asset class, meaning it is difficult to assess what portion of a given TVL value consists of cryptocurrency assets versus real-world assets. As is the case with Provenance Blockchain, some blockchains are aiming to self-publish their TVL data by asset class. Additionally, several analytics firms are also working to make this data more accessible, such as RWA.xyz, which focuses on data for tokenized real-world assets. RWA TVL is a necessary data point and standard for financial services and insurance institutions deciding which blockchain to leverage.  TVL is a crucial indicator for institutions seeking to tokenize RWAs, helping them identify the most suitable blockchain platforms based on real-world asset adoption and growth. As the financial industry continues to adopt these innovations, RWA TVL is expected to play an instrumental role in guiding decisions and driving institutional adoption.

42409781,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcPIMl,1693410300,Why Good Indexes Are Vital to Crypto‚Äôs Future,"Indexes are pivotal in asset markets as the cornerstone of financial market growth and an essential tool for investors. In crypto, however, the nascent state of index availability and adoption is a significant impediment for investors. Currently, the equivalent advice to ‚Äúbuy the index‚Äù is to purchase bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum‚Äôs ether (ETH) in a centralized account, which is insufficient to attract new capital from sophisticated investors. Indexes allow for efficient asset allocation, risk management, product development and performance measurement. Without indexes, crypto cannot evolve into an institutional financial market.  Many of the required components for a successful index exist today: compliant institutional exchanges, robust data and sophisticated methodologists, among others. However, what is missing in the U.S. is regulatory support and index adoption that captures the more nuanced and differentiating aspects of crypto markets, such as proof-of-stake reward rates. Despite the absence of regulatory guidance, the industry must continue to push forward with the development of indexes.  You‚Äôre reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  We summarize the impact of index adoption in the following six sections:  Price discovery and credibility: Indexes facilitate price discovery by aggregating data from multiple sources and calculating a representative value. Investors struggle to determine fair values without reliable indexes, hindering market participation. Professionally managed indexes instill credibility, bolstering confidence in retail and institutional investors.  Benchmarking and investment products: Indexes provide benchmarks against which asset performance can be measured. Investors struggle to reliably compare different investment products or managers without established indexes. This lack of benchmarking impedes the creation of investment vehicles like derivatives (a key component to sophisticated portfolio management) and cryptocurrency ETFs (which could attract significant retail and institutional capital).  Risk management and transparency: Indexes help investors assess the risk and volatility associated with an asset. The absence of reliable risk metrics hampers investors' ability to manage their exposure and transfer risk effectively. Even more than their predecessors, Web3 indexes are fully transparent as all data is viewable on-chain. Fully transparent indexes enhance risk assessment by improving asset allocation models and contributing to market stability and a more informed investment process.  Market research and analysis: Indexes offer valuable data for academics and analysts to study market trends, correlations and behaviors. This research informs strategies and contributes to a deeper understanding of the asset class, ultimately aiding its development.  Standardization and language: Indexes promote standardization in measuring and evaluating market performance. A lack of established indexes in the crypto market hinders the creation of a common language and universal standard among market participants. Without indexes to establish reference rates, markets cannot reach the depth needed to attract significant capital.  Institutional participation: Professionally managed indexes attract institutional participation by providing a reliable foundation for investment decisions. Institutional involvement enhances market liquidity and stability, accelerating overall asset class growth.  Indexing is vital for the advancement of new asset classes like crypto. While currently hampered by the regulatory environment in the U.S., efficient and professionally managed indexes would improve the safety and stability of markets. As the cryptocurrency industry continues to evolve, the development and adoption of reputable indexes is instrumental in attracting institutional investors, increasing liquidity and advancing the overall maturity of the asset class.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | RESEARCH,"Jason Hall, John McNiff",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/coindesk-indices/2023/08/30/why-good-indexes-are-vital-to-cryptos-future,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f585e7c2fb974001d47fc07ef5d394c9dbfeef8e-4256x2832.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409806,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcPInD,1693407600,Ethereum Handled Friend.tech Frenzy Without 'Gas Fee' Spike. Why That‚Äôs a Big Deal,"Vitalik Buterin and other top Ethereum developers have repeatedly made the case that so-called ‚Äúlayer-2‚Äù projects ‚Äì secondary systems that operate atop a blockchain to provide faster and cheaper transactions ‚Äì could help to reduce congestion on the main network, and therefore fees.  The de-congestion plan might actually be working, possibly aided by the recent rollout of the U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase‚Äôs new layer-2 project, Base.  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Ethereum, which saw its transaction fees ‚Äì known as gas fees ‚Äì reach a yearly high in May following a meme-coin mania, has witnessed the fees drop significantly in the past few weeks, with some analysts attributing the decline to the increasing availability of layer 2s, and thus the benefits of the scaling architecture.  The decline is remarkable given the recent runaway success of the crypto-fueled social marketplace Friend.tech, a web3 app that went live earlier this month. Friend.tech quickly attracted more than 100,000 users and generated more than $25 million in fees.  In the past, a fad of that magnitude might have come with extreme congestion, and a rapid surge in fees. But Ethereum has seen its gas fees drop ‚Äì in no small part due to the project‚Äôs existence on the Base sub-network, rather than the blockchain's main layer. Since the launch of Friend.tech, Ethereum‚Äôs daily gas fees have averaged 26% lower than they did in the year up to that point, according to data from FalconX Research.  Several older and larger layer-2 networks, including Arbitrum, Optimism and zkSync, are now handling a large chunk of the transactions happening on the overall Ethereum ecosystem.  ‚ÄúThe L2 scaling vision is being realized,"" said Kunal Goel, a senior research analyst at Messari.  Less Ethereum congestion  In the past, increased activity on the Ethereum network has resulted in the blockchain becoming temporarily clogged, and high demand usually means higher fees.  In December 2017, when CryptoKitties, a project built on Ethereum where users could buy, collect and breed digital cats, first launched, the network saw gas fees reach above 900 gwei.  High gas fees also spiked in April 2022, when Yuga Labs released Otherdeeds ‚Äî non-fungible tokens that represented digital real estate. Ethereum average gas fees soared to about 7,600 gwei ($439 at the time). A more typical range is 15 to 30 gwei.  In early May of this year, Ethereum‚Äôs gas fees ‚Äì what users pay to perform functions on Ethereum, such as sending or receiving the cryptocurrency ether ‚Äì hit a 12-month high, as the blockchain became costlier to use from investors trading millions for a frog-themed token called pepecoin (PEPE). On one day in May, the fee shot to a median price of 155 gwei.  Now, with the Friend.tech crypto craze peaking, the median gas fee on Ethereum is around 13 gwei. And that's partly because the explosion of activity is actually happening off the main Ethereum chain, on Base.  Friend.tech drove transaction count on Base to a record high of 15.88 transactions per second (TPS) over 24 hours on Aug. 22, exceeding even Ethereum, along with rival layer-2 blockchains Arbitrum and Optimism, according to the website L2beat.  During the peak of the Friend.tech frenzy, Ethereum gas fees actually dropped to an average gas price of 18 gwei.  And the heaviest of Friend.tech traffic appears to have now passed, with transactions down 95% from the peak of 38,000 on Aug. 21, according to data from Dune analytics.  Data from IntoTheBlock shows that over the past few months, the number of combined transactions on Ethereum and optimistic roll-ups has climbed near an all-time high. But the growth came mainly on the layer 2s; the level of transactions on Ethereum, by itself, has stayed relatively stable.  The dynamic has allowed Ethereum fees to remain at sustainable levels.  ‚ÄúEarlier, gas fees on Ethereum would spike during periods of high activity (high volatility events, NFT launches),"" Messari‚Äôs Goel said. Now, the overall Ethereum ecosystem ‚Äì broadly writ, including its associated layer-2 networks ‚Äì ""is able to support much higher transaction volume.‚Äù  Matt Kunke, a senior research analyst at GSR, said he expects the trend to continue as Ethereum undergoes an upcoming upgrade known as proto-danksharding (EIP-4844), which will make it cheaper for layer-2 networks to store data on the main blockchain.  It's ""an improvement that will materially increase L2 throughput and lower the cost of transacting on rollups,‚Äù Kunke said.  Christopher Martin, Amberdata‚Äôs director of research, notes that Bitcoin transactions have increased since the launch of Bitcoin Ordinals (a method of generating NFTs through a process called inscribing), which may have taken some volume away from Ethereum, further alleviating pressure.  Layer 2s have been ‚Äúmore interesting lately,‚Äù according to Martin. ‚ÄúMeme tokens such as BALD and social dApps like Friend.tech provide traders with an opportunity to earn high yield, and the ongoing bear market is still unable to draw in users or rebuild traction.‚Äù  ‚ÄúAll of these factors together seem to have pulled out a lot of the excitement that NFT collections were able to generate just a few years ago, which were able to cause extremely high gas and transactions,‚Äù according to Martin.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/30/ethereum-handled-friendtech-frenzy-without-fee-spike-why-thats-a-big-deal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/04074cce3ea0e571ab87ef2115c1b671f74a5eb0-2047x1151.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

6877,http://blokt.com/?p=50598,1693405897,Best Bitcoin Gambling Sites,"When Satoshi created Bitcoin in 2009, it didn‚Äôt take long before some clever individuals started exploring its use for online gambling. Hitting recent highs of over $60,000, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum are gaining in popularity, and many users are choosing to use them for online gambling. IN A RUSH? Go straight to our expert‚Äôs top pick. For the best all-around Bitcoin gambling experience, Bitstarz is our top pick. Play on Bitstarz Now Now, over a decade later, many different cryptocurrencies can be used for gambling, and hundreds of different crypto casinos have launched to fill this huge new demand. Discover the best Bitcoin gambling sites in our expert‚Äôs top picks. Out of the land rush to create the best Bitcoin casino , a few sites emerged as leaders in the new crypto-powered gaming industry. In 2023, these sites continue to evolve, offering new ways to play and pushing innovations in crypto gambling. Best Option for Your Country NOTE: Many gambling sites restrict certain countries from using their services. Although some users may choose to use a VPN to access the sites, its probably a better idea to find a site that doesn‚Äôt exclude your country. The table below lists the best sites for users from countries that are sometimes excluded. Country Working Casino Play United States Play Now United Kingdom Play Now Australia Play Now France Play Now Netherlands Play Now Spain Play Now Italy Play Now Sweden Play Now Israel Play Now If you‚Äôre a user in a country not listed above then you can ignore this table and continue on to read our selection of the best overall sites below. Crypto Gambling vs. Traditional Gambling Here, we‚Äôre going to explore some of the best Bitcoin gambling sites the industry has to offer and discover the unique player experience each casino brings. But before we get started, let‚Äôs find out why you might want to use cryptocurrency for gambling in the first place. You might be wondering, why use cryptocurrency to gamble, when you could just use traditional currency and payment types? It‚Äôs a great question, and it‚Äôs best answered with a list of the pros and cons of crypto gambling vs. traditional gambling. Pros of crypto gambling Transaction speeds ‚Äì Deposits and withdrawals are usually much faster compared to traditional methods such as bank transfers, because of the speed of blockchain transactions. Most withdrawals can be processed in 1 hour or less. Higher limits ‚Äì Many crypto gambling sites will have higher deposit and withdrawal limits for crypto customers, meaning you can withdraw more of your winnings in a shorter amount of time. Anonymity ‚Äì Some, but not all, crypto casinos and gambling sites will allow you to deposit funds and play without verifying your identity, which is great if you‚Äôre privacy-conscious. Transparency ‚Äì If you play using a dedicated crypto gambling site, most of the transactions that you make will be on the blockchain, meaning that they are traceable and immutable, and reducing the likelihood of the ‚Äòhouse‚Äô cheating. Amazing bonuses ‚Äì Often, crypto casinos and gaming sites are able to offer bonuses and promotions which simply wouldn‚Äôt be possible using regular fiat currencies! Better odds ‚Äì Everyone knows that casinos have a slight advantage over their players called ‚Äòhouse edge‚Äô, and it‚Äôs needed to keep casinos profitable. But with Bitcoin gambling sites, the house edge can be lower because of decreased costs ‚Äì and with some crypto casinos, there‚Äôs no house edge at all. Cons of crypto gambling Less choice ‚Äì At the moment, there are fewer crypto gaming sites than traditional online casinos, so players have access to fewer games, but this is changing, and may even flip in the future. Some technical know-how required ‚Äì To gamble with crypto, you‚Äôre going to need to buy crypto! Not everyone is tech-savvy enough to do this at first, but this guide will teach you how. Volatility ‚Äì As Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are volatile, with their value fluctuating throughout the day, the value of your winnings could be eroded by market forces. However, you should remember its value can also go up! How can you use crypto to gamble? Naturally, to start gambling with crypto, you‚Äôll first need to buy some coins or tokens from an exchange. Bitcoin is by far the most popular choice for crypto gambling, although many online casinos will also accept ‚Äòalt-coins‚Äô such as Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, or even Dogecoin. To buy Bitcoin, you‚Äôll first need to make an account with an exchange where you can buy crypto with fiat currency, such as Coinbase. These exchanges let you buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which you can then transfer to your favorite crypto gambling site! We explain some of the best and easiest ways to buy cryptocurrency in our ‚Äò How to Buy Bitcoin ‚Äô guide, so check it out if you need help buying your first Bitcoin. Some of the casinos we‚Äôre going to look at here also allow you to buy crypto using a credit or debit card, instead of buying crypto on an exchange and transferring it over. However, many crypto gambling sites will require you to send crypto to your casino wallet to play, so it‚Äôs best to familiarize yourself with this process first! When you‚Äôre playing on a Bitcoin gambling site, unless you‚Äôre a real big player, you usually won‚Äôt be betting whole Bitcoins! Instead, most Bitcoin betting sites will let you place bets in ‚Äòmilli-bitcoin‚Äô or ‚ÄòmBTC‚Äô, which is 0.001 BTC. Naturally, you can also place bets lower than this on most sites. Best Bitcoin Gambling Sites So, you‚Äôve decided you want to gamble with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, and you‚Äôve got your crypto ready to go. But how do you choose the best gambling site? Use the table below to take a look at our top picks, or scroll down to read a detailed review on each site.

Play Now Read Review Hopefully, you‚Äôll be ready to decide after reading this guide, but there are a few general things to keep in mind. Many sites have different games on offer, different supported currencies, and will accept players from different jurisdictions. Make sure you pay attention to these key features: Game choice ‚Äì Not every Bitcoin gambling site will have the same games, as each casino works with a variety of game providers. As a result, some will have more types of certain games, such as slots ‚Äì so choose a provider with plenty of your favorite game type. Funding ‚Äì Some crypto casinos will only support cryptocurrency deposits, or perhaps just Bitcoin deposits, whereas others will also support traditional payments. Before you create an account, make sure you can play with your crypto of choice. Security ‚Äì Is the Bitcoin casino you‚Äôre sending your crypto to safe and trusted? Some less well-known casinos might not have adequate security, and your funds could be at risk. The casino‚Äôs we‚Äôre going to discover here are all trusted and transparent. So, without further ado, let‚Äôs explore our top crypto gambling site picks for 2023! 1. Cloudbet Cloudbet are the oldest but one of the most innovative Bitcoin gambling sites Cloudbet might be one of the longest-running Bitcoin gambling sites, but there are plenty of innovative features to keep players coming back for more. Launched in 2013, Cloudbet is regulated and licensed in Montenegro and Cura√ßao, and serves customers in most countries, except for the U.S., the UK, and a handful of European countries. Currently, Cloudbet supports BTC, ETH, BCH, USDT, USDC, PAX, PAXG, LINK, DAI, DASH, DOGE and LTC. Cloudbet prides itself on offering better odds than traditional fiat casinos, which has been one of its unique selling points since its launch. On their website, Cloudbet claims that the disintermediation of third-party payment processors through Bitcoin has allowed them to provide fairer and more transparent gaming. Recently, Cloudbet has pivoted its attention towards the enormous Esports industry, which has attracted many new users for the casino. Let‚Äôs find out how Cloudbet has evolved since its launch and its focus for 2023. As the Ethereum Merge approached, Cloudbet announced support for Ethereum that has been staked on Lido. StETH is now available to all players who want to place a bet using staked coins. New for the 2023/24 season, Cloudbet now allows its players to bet on the German Bundesliga. This year‚Äôs season will be the 61st, having celebrated the 60th anniversary this August. Cloudbet players can use Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to bet on the Bundesliga with advantages such as quick transactions and lower fees. Cloudbet table and slots games Cloudbet has over 1,000 slots games and 100+ table games With thousands of table games, virtual games, and slots titles to choose from, players are sure to find a classic and immersive casino experience at Cloudbet. Cloudbet has over 1,000 slots games, and over 100 classic casino games including roulette, baccarat, blackjack, dice, and craps. Their range of slots games, despite not being as numerous as BitStarz, are from many of the same games providers, so there are a lot of familiar titles available to play on Cloudbet. Cloudbet Esports Bet big on Esports tournaments with Cloudbet Electronic sports, or ‚ÄòEsports‚Äô, are gaming tournaments played online using multiplayer video games. These can be anything from team games, to shooters, or even electronic versions of real sports like soccer. Cloudbet is one of the few crypto gambling sites to offer Esports betting, on some of the biggest competitive video gaming titles in the world. Although competitive Esports is still fairly new, they‚Äôve attracted a huge and dedicated fan base, and many spectators are eager to place bets on the outcomes of games. Cloudbet currently offer sports betting on the following Esports tournaments: Call of Duty Counter-Strike Dota 2 FIFA King of Glory League of Legends Starcraft It‚Äôs estimated that 1.57 billion tuned in to at least one Esports match in 2019, and this number is likely to grow in the future. Gambling sites like Cloudbet, who have offered Esports betting for a long time, are a great choice if you‚Äôre looking to place a crypto bet on an upcoming game or tournament. Cloudbet sportsbook Bet on a huge variety of real-life games with Cloudbet‚Äôs sportsbook Cloudbet also has a decent range of sportsbook betting, which has been running since its launch in 2013. Similar to FortuneJack, Cloudbet offers betting on all the major spectator sports like soccer, NBA, and NFL, but also covers some niche sports too. Players can place bets on table tennis matches, volleyball, badminton, and even ice hockey matches. Also, classic sporting events like darts and boxing are available to bet on through Cloudbet, all in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. In April 2022, Cloudbet announced its new and upgraded Horse Racing Service. This new service comes following the success of their Beta service, which was created for the Melbourne Cup in November 2021. Cloudbet promises highly competitive odds for races of all grades and has high limits for the more popular races. Cloudbet has also improved its pricing structure and options for parlays. Is Cloudbet Safe? Cloudbet keeps user deposits in cold storage, which provides the highest level of fund security available, and makes Cloudbet one of the safest exchanges on our list. Cloudbet only uses hot wallets ‚Äì those connected to the internet ‚Äì when it needs to process withdrawals. This means that when not in play, your funds are kept in an offline wallet, which is highly resistant to hacks and theft ‚Äì even if the Cloudbet site itself is compromised. You can read more about hot and cold Bitcoin wallets here . At any one time, should the casino be attacked by hackers, there would only be a small amount of Bitcoin available to steal, which makes Cloudbet an unattractive target and a safe casino. Cloudbet Customer Service Cloudbet uses ZenDesk, a third-party help desk software provider, to provide extensive FAQs for players in need. However, this is incredibly hard to find in the standard casino interface and does require some searching around the site to get help. There‚Äôs a live chat feature within the help desk, but this isn‚Äôt shown on the site except in live table games where you might need immediate assistance. This does make it a little harder to get instant help on Cloudbet if you run into any issues, in contrast to BitStarz or FortuneJack where an assistant is just the touch of a button away. Cloudbet Summary With a huge Esports section, Cloudbet is a stand-out competitor, offering access to an entirely new niche of Bitcoin gambling. As a result, the casino has attracted many new users who wouldn‚Äôt normally place bets using cryptocurrency. It‚Äôs a smart move by Cloudbet to attract new users, and if you‚Äôre an Esports fan, we highly recommend you try out Cloudbet‚Äôs easy-to-use betting experience for your next Esports wager! Cloudbet also added a great loyalty program in November 2022. So going into 2023, players can earn lightning points, climb loyalty tiers, refer friends, and shop in the marketplace. This is great for more frequent players who want to be rewarded for their long-standing business with the brand. Cloudbet‚Äôs sportsbook, while easy to navigate and providing in-play betting, generally offers more limited betting options than FortuneJack. Nevertheless, it still covers a great range of sports, including MMA matches, which many other crypto sportsbooks don‚Äôt currently provide. While Cloudbet‚Äôs range of casino-style games is somewhat lacking compared to the mega slots of BitStarz or the huge variety of live table games on FortuneJack, there‚Äôs still plenty of variety to choose from, with hundreds of popular titles from leading game providers. Cloudbet really excels in fund safety and security, providing dedicated cold storage to customer‚Äôs Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash deposits, and only using hot wallets to process customer withdrawals. Many other Bitcoin casino sites don‚Äôt provide details about their fund security, so if you‚Äôre safety-conscious it‚Äôs good to know that your Bitcoin is secured with Cloudbet. Pros Cons Fantastic Esports betting options Decent variety of sporting events for sportsbooks bets Best-in-class cryptocurrency and bitcoin fund security Highly transparent custody and provability Well-established and trusted Limited crypto payment options Less engaging user interface No fiat payment options Play on Cloudbet Now 2. BitStarz BitStarz is one of the most popular Bitcoin gambling sites in the world BitStarz is perhaps the most popular crypto gambling site in the world, mainly due to its huge range of slots games ‚Äì a firm favorite among many online casino players. According to a recent blog post they have over 3.4 Million players, 3,600 games, with the biggest win on the platform being over ‚Ç¨2.4 Million! BitStarz‚Äôs collection of slots games is so large that it‚Äôs earned the nickname ‚ÄòKing of Slots‚Äô, and in total there are over 1,800 games to choose from on the casino! Aside from Bitcoin, players can deposit and play with Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Tether on BitStarz, although some games may not accept every currency type. If you‚Äôre new to Bitcoin or crypto, you‚Äôll also be pleased to find out that BitStarz accepts all major credit cards and multiple other payment processors for depositing euros. Bear in mind that if you‚Äôre from a country that doesn‚Äôt use the euro, you might be charged a foreign currency exchange fee by your bank. Choosing to credit your account in euros will require identity verification, so if you‚Äôre not comfortable with this, try crediting your account with Bitcoin. Using cryptocurrency will also allow for much faster withdrawals, with 90% of crypto withdrawals processed in under 10 minutes on BitStarz. BitStarz Slots Dubbed the ‚ÄòKing of Slots‚Äô, there‚Äôs an enormous variety of slots games on BitStarz As we‚Äôve briefly mentioned, BitStarz has become such a popular exchange largely because of its huge range of slots games. Although every online casino has its fair share of slots titles, BitStarz has some of the very best titles from industry-leading game providers. BitStarz slots games are based on a huge amount of themes, from classic fruit reels to the popular TV-show Narcos, and Wild West fantasy games ‚Äì every slots fan is sure to find a favorite. Many BitStarz slots games also generate huge jackpots, sometimes worth millions of euros, which one lucky player can scoop up. At any one time, there are at least 20 slots games with massive jackpots available, with most worth a few thousand to tens of thousands of euros! In February 2023, BitStarz launched Livespins, a new way of playing slot games that adds a social entertainment element to the casino experience. Players can join a Livespins stream, chat with other players, and bet on the action. The platform offers some great community features, including the ability to set a nickname and avatar and a chat function that includes support for dank gifs and reactions to show appreciation to other commenters. Livespins is now available to all BitStarz members. To find out more about this popular Bitcoin casino site, read our full Bitstarz review . BitStarz Tournaments and Promotions Promotions are tournaments are a regular occurrence on BitStarz Experienced crypto casino players may associate BitStarz with regular tournaments, promotions, and prizes, which are often the biggest and best in the industry ‚Äì and the most numerous! If you head over to BitStarz, you‚Äôll see that they currently have three tournament types that run all year round. These are Slot Wars, Table Wars, and Last Man Standing. As the name suggests, Slot Wars pits players against each other across BitStarz‚Äôs huge range of slots games, automatically entering players into a points-based race to the top of the leader board. The more you wager, the more points you gain. Top players take home a cash prize, with first-place scooping a ‚Ç¨300 prize and hundreds of free spins. This is the same for Table Wars, which rewards the top table game players with a huge cash prize of ‚Ç¨3,000! BitStarz also gives players the chance to earn free spins every Wednesday and matches deposits by 50% every single Monday. The casino also regularly runs competitions, such as the chance to win a brand new Tesla car. Bitstarz have recently upgraded their welcome offering for new players, which is already one of the best in the Bitcoin gambling world. BitStarz have now added the ‚Äòwelcome freeroll‚Äô, which transforms new players‚Äô 20 free spins into a slice of ‚Ç¨1,000 ‚Äì without the need to make a deposit. Is BitStarz Safe? When it comes to fairness, BitStarz takes transparency and provability very seriously. Every game on the casino comes with its own provability widget, which shows players the client seed and hash value for each round of the game. Players can check this value using a hash calculator, to make sure the game hasn‚Äôt been rigged in BitStarz‚Äôs favor. BitStarz doesn‚Äôt share details of how their player‚Äôs funds are secured within the exchange, however, they do enable two-factor authentication (2FA) through Google Authenticator, which makes logging in and protecting your account much safer. Overall, BitStarz has a good safety track record, with no major security incidents in its history. How good is customer service on BitStarz? BitStarz absolutely excels in customer service, hiring only experienced online casino professionals to handle customer issues and provide 24/7 live chat support throughout your Bitcoin gambling experience. According to the BitStarz website, all of their customer service representatives must have at least three years‚Äô experience at other casinos before they work for BitStarz. There are also extensive FAQs on the BitStarz website, which will answer most players‚Äô questions. BitStarz summary Since its launch, BitStarz has become both the most popular Bitcoin gambling site and a major rival to traditional online casinos. With thousands of innovative games to choose from and a mega-collection of slots games. BitStarz has got enough to entertain even the most demanding of players. However, if you‚Äôre a big sports gambler, you‚Äôll be disappointed to learn that BitStarz doesn‚Äôt have a sportsbook feature, nor do they currently support betting on Esports. Perhaps the most impressive feature of BitStarz is their regular and generous tournaments, jackpots, and promotions, which reward frequent players and keep the casino experience feeling fresh and exciting. BitStarz‚Äôs award-winning customer service team is one of the best in the industry, so if you‚Äôre looking for a safe and easy-to-use casino experience, BitStarz is the perfect choice. You can read more about Bitstarz in our extensive Bitstarz Review .

FortuneJack sportsbook You can gamble on a huge number of games with FortuneJack‚Äôs sportsbook Like traditional betting shops or bookies, online casinos with sportsbook features let players place a bet on live sporting events. Just like regular betting, these bets can be placed on anything from a game outcome, to how many points are scored in the first half. FortuneJack has an amazing, feature-rich sportsbook , which offers Bitcoin betting on both upcoming sports matches, live in-play games, and virtual sports. Players can bet on well-known sporting events such as football premier leagues, NBA basketball, and NFL American football; or more niche sports such as table tennis, winter sports, and badminton. Occasionally, FortuneJack also lets players bet on cultural events, such as the outcome of the next UK general elections. Since its launch, the FortuneJack sportsbook has become the most popular bitcoin sports betting service, likely because of its user-friendly interface and a massive range of sports. It‚Äôs even come to rival that of traditional betting sites, such as Coral and Betfair. FortuneJack Dice Dice games have become increasingly popular among Bitcoin gamblers, as their simplicity and high-odds make for an interesting game. Players can bet Bitcoin, up to a maximum bet of 1 BTC, on the outcome of a virtual dice roll, betting on the roll either being above or below a certain number. Players can set their ‚Äòwin chance‚Äô, which will decide how likely a certain roll outcome is to occur. Naturally, as FortuneJack‚Äôs dice game is entirely online, players may question if it‚Äôs truly random and fair. Luckily, FortuneJack has thought carefully about transparency, and have built a verification system which players can use to track their rolls. Each roll generates two separate seeds, a server seed and a client seed, which together decide the value of each roll and guarantee it‚Äôs not manipulated.

Bitcasino Bitcasino has a huge range of slots games on offer Established in 2014, Bitcasino is a Cura√ßao licensed online casino, where you can play using multiple cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tron, Litecoin, and Tether. In April 2020, Bitcasino announced support for Ripple (XRP), with minimum deposits starting from just 50 XRP, and minimum withdrawals from just 100 XRP. Users can also deposit and play with Japanese Yen (JPY) using a credit or debit card, so there‚Äôs no need to just use crypto if you want to play on Bitcasino. It‚Äôs unclear whether Bitcasino also accepts other fiat deposits, but you can buy Bitcoin using a credit card directly through the casino. Players from Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, the U.S., Netherlands, Spain, Australia, and Italy are currently restricted from using Bitcasino, though all other jurisdictions are welcome. In late 2019, Bitcasino took part in an environmental initiative to plant 101,000 trees, costing $1 per tree. This was in association with #TeamTrees, and players could pledge their unused loyalty club points to the scheme ‚Äì so if you‚Äôre looking for a Bitcoin casino that‚Äôs also committed to doing good, Bitcasino is a great choice. Bitcasino makes an effort to keep its users informed about recent developments in the cryptocurrency space. It‚Äôs refreshing to see a casino with an interest in the cryptocurrency side of the business, having published recent articles such as: Serenity is here: Everything you need to know about ETH 2.0 Crypto in Asia: Top developments for 2021 Best Bitcoin banks: top Bitcoin-friendly banks you should know Bitcasino has some really fun and unique games, such as Monopoly Live , multiple lottery games, and a large range of bingo games. There are also great rewards for regular players through the Bitcasino Loyalty Club, so it‚Äôs a casino that‚Äôs worth checking out. Let‚Äôs take a closer look at some of Bitcasino‚Äôs features! The Bitcasino loyalty and VIP club Have you got what it takes to become VIP? One of the features we love about Bitcasio is its loyalty club, where players can grow their rewards as they play in return for awesome prizes and rewards. With seven levels to progress through, starting at ‚ÄòBeginner‚Äô all the way to ‚ÄòHero‚Äô, players simply have to place bets in order to gain points. Although it takes some time to reach the top levels, players will be rewarded throughout their journey with free spins, free chips, and even cashback rewards. Bitcasino‚Äôs cashback rewards range from 5 ‚Äì 10% based on what level you are, and how often you play, but for regular gamblers the Bitcasino Loyalty Club can be a great way to get some extra cash to bet! There‚Äôs also a VIP members area, which is an invitation-only club for dedicated Bitcasino players. Once you‚Äôve been invited to the VIP club, you‚Äôll get access to your own personal assistant, unique offers and promotions, and even get invited to special VIP events. Bitcasino video bingo Bingo games aren‚Äôt offered by many online casino operators A pretty unique feature of Bitcasino is its ‚ÄòVideo Bingo‚Äô games. These titles, similar to the original physical game of bingo where players match their numbers to those called by the dealer, are a popular choice among Bitcasino players. It‚Äôs one of only a handful of Bitcoin gambling sites to offer bingo games, and Bitcasino has multiple titles to choose from. Bitcasino‚Äôs bingo games range from monkey mayhem themes to crazy circus, and even genie themes! For those who are used to playing more traditional casino games like roulette and blackjack, bingo can be a fun and light-hearted new gambling experience. Bitcasino is also a great place for regular bingo players who want to try their hand at Bitcoin gambling too, as their games are similar to those found at Mecca or Gala bingo. Bitcasino lottery Bitcasino is one of the few crypto gambling sites to offer lottery games Another niche game type found on Bitcasino that many other online casinos don‚Äôt usually offer is a range of lottery games, which just like a traditional lottery lets players choose numbers that are pulled out of a random number generator. Bitcasino have multiple lottery types, all of which are instant win ‚Äì meaning the balls are drawn in front of you, and you can win during a single session, no need to wait for a future draw! Users can either randomly choose how many numbers they want to be selected like a lotto lucky dip, or pick their own winning numbers. It‚Äôs a great game type for gamblers who like the thrill of live lottery calls, from the comfort of their own home. Bitcasino Bitcoin poker Buy-in to a live poker game using Bitcoin on Bitcasino Another popular feature of Bitcasino is its multiplayer Bitcoin poker games, where users can buy-in to live tables and play against other players in real-time across the world. These games require a buy-in in Bitcoin, which makes the game exactly like sitting and playing at a real poker table. Once you‚Äôre in, you can buy chips using Bitcoin, and play as many hands as you like. Other players can join and leave the game as it‚Äôs in play. Is Bitcasino safe? Bitcasino doesn‚Äôt specifically list the precautions they take to protect user‚Äôs Bitcoin and crypto deposits, however, they do assure players that their funds are safe. Nevertheless, without details of Bitcasino‚Äôs custody methods, it‚Äôs difficult to say for certain how secure deposits are on the casino. That said, there‚Äôs never been any loss of funds or hacks of the casino since it‚Äôs launch, and it used SSL encryption to protect personal data on the site. Bitcasino offers its players the option to enable 2FA to log in to their account, through Google Authenticator. How good is customer service on Bitcasino? Bitcasino has a dedicated live chat support feature, which like other Bitcoin casinos, makes it easy and quick to get help when you need it. There are some detailed articles in the Bitcasino help center, but these are a little limited in scope and mainly deal with problems players might have with deposits and payment options. It‚Äôs also not as easy as some other casinos to navigate through help topics, but there‚Äôs generally a good level of support, and players can always email the Bitcasino team for further help. Bitcasino summary For those who don‚Äôt want to navigate exchanges, crypto wallets, and Bitcoin addresses, Bitcasino is a perfect choice ‚Äì players can simply purchase Bitcoin using their credit card once they‚Äôve made an account. But remember, you will need to validate your identity if you choose this method. The number of games on Bitcasino is limited compared to some of the other casinos we‚Äôve reviewed here, but it makes up for that with niche lottery and bingo games. Bitcasino‚Äôs live poker matches, which function just like a real table game of poker, are a great way for classic casino lovers to buy-in with Bitcoin. Compared to other crypto casinos like FortuneJack and BitStarz, Bitcasino‚Äôs user interface does feel slightly dated, and it‚Äôs somewhat more difficult to navigate between the sections and find your favorite games than other casinos. However, overall Bitcasino is a good crypto casino for those who want access to a decent amount of games and perhaps aren‚Äôt as interested in a huge range of slots games. Pros Cons Niche game types like bingo and lottery Both crypto and fiat accepted Players can buy Bitcoin directly through the casino Fewer games than FortuneJack or BitStarz No sportsbook feature No Bitcoin dice games Less engaging user interface Play on Bitcasino Now Our Verdict The crypto gambling site you choose will mainly depend on what type of player you are. That said, some of the online casinos we‚Äôve reviewed offer more features than others, or excel in a certain area. Let‚Äôs have a look at the best casino‚Äôs in each category, then choose an overall winner! Best crypto gambling sites for slots For big-time slots lovers, then it‚Äôs hard to beat BitStarz huge range of slots titles, who have truly earned their place as the ‚ÄòKing of Slots‚Äô.

Play on Bitstarz Now Best site for niche games If you‚Äôre a fan of bingo or lottery games, then Bitcasino is an excellent choice.

It‚Äôs also an easy way to access Esports betting for crypto investors who aren‚Äôt familiar with the industry, as many tournaments aren‚Äôt highly televised on mainstream media, so it can be hard to keep up to date with events.

According to several posts on the social media platform X, Binance plans to terminate its support for its native BUSD stablecoin by 2024, urging users to convert the token to other crypto assets. This development was revealed via a pop-up notification on the exchange‚Äôs mobile app. Although there was no specific date in the notification, it was stated that Paxos Trust, BUSD‚Äôs issuer and operator, will stop BUSD redemption by February 2024. Following this, Binance will gradually withdraw its support for the stablecoin. As earlier stated, the BUSD token has been affected by the high level of regulatory scrutiny faced by the cryptocurrency industry in 2023.

16734111,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549416,1693403336,"Ethereum Price Prediction for 2023, 2024, 2025, 2030 and Beyond","Ethereum has rapidly become the second most valuable cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. With its recent transition to a proof-of-stake consensus model and its expanded capabilities, Ethereum‚Äôs future looks bright. This guide provides a data-driven Ethereum price prediction for the short, medium and long-term. What is Ethereum (ETH)? Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform created by Vitalik Buterin in 2015. Like Bitcoin, it uses a blockchain to store transaction records. But Ethereum‚Äôs key innovation was enabling decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts on its blockchain. The Ethereum blockchain serves as a secured public ledger for verifying and recording transactions. Ether (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the platform that acts as ‚Äògas‚Äô to power transactions and run smart contracts. Some key aspects of Ethereum include: Smart contracts These are applications that run exactly as programmed without risk of downtime or third-party interference. Decentralized platform Ethereum operates via a global peer-to-peer network, avoiding centralized control. Programmable blockchain Developers can use Ethereum to build and deploy decentralized applications of all kinds. Proof-of-stake consensus Ethereum has transitioned to a more efficient proof-of-stake system called Casper that requires less energy. These features make Ethereum extremely versatile and a promising platform for decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, DAOs, dApps and much more. Factors Influencing Ethereum Price Ethereum‚Äôs growth has been explosive, but not without volatility. Here are some factors that affect ETH prices. Cryptocurrency Market Trends Like most cryptos, Ethereum price depends heavily on trends in the overall crypto market. Bitcoin‚Äôs price actions in particular have a ripple effect on altcoins. Gas Fees and Transaction Costs Ethereum gas fees rising during times of network congestion reduces usage and can suppress price. Efforts like scaling solutions aim to lower transaction costs. Mainstream Adoption With increasing real-world Ethereum usage cases in DeFi, NFTs etc. mainstream adoption is rising, leading to higher demand and prices. Competition While Ethereum is the dominant smart contract platform currently, competition from projects like Solana, Cardano etc. can potentially erode its market share and affect ETH prices. Regulations Regulatory crackdowns or increased clarity on crypto/Ethereum can both positively and negatively impact prices by affecting investor sentiment. Technology Upgrades Recent Ethereum developments like the Merge upgrade to proof-of-stake or ETH 2.0 implementating sharding may improve capabilities and affect value over time. Burning Ether Burning ETH taken out of circulation through EIP-1559 helps reduce supply and may gradually increase the value of remaining Ether. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction for 2023, 2024, 2025, 2030 and Beyond Ethereum Price History Ethereum launched in 2015 at an initial price of around $0.30. Here is a look at key price developments since then. 2015-2017 ‚Äì The Early Days After launch, Ethereum traded in the $1-$15 range till early 2017. As crypto markets gained steam in 2017, Ethereum shot up to $380 by June. Several factors drove growth: Increasing developer adoption with global Ethereum hackathons held in 2017. Hundreds of projects were built on Ethereum. Mainstream coverage of Ethereum as a revolutionary technology in magazines like Forbes ICO boom ‚Äì projects raising millions via Ethereum-based ICOs bought Ether at inflated prices This growth was unsustainable long-term and by September 2018, ETH had fallen to around $170. But immense developer interest and real-world usage potential was now apparent. 2018-2020 ‚Äì Building During the Bear Market In the 2018-2020 bear market, Ethereum stayed afloat better than most altcoins, remaining above $100. Major mileposts include: Despite market conditions, steady progress continued on Ethereum 2.0 upgrades like Beacon Chain, proof-of-stake, and sharding. Increasing DeFi (decentralized finance) dominance with Ethereum facilitating over 90% of activity and billions in value. Launch of Ethereum-based Tether (USDT), the most used stablecoin. USDT transactions dwarfed payment coins. ERC-20 standard became the de-facto for issuing new tokens. Most ICOs continued to launch on Ethereum. This demonstrated Ethereum‚Äôs real-world utility and helped prevent steeper declines. 2021 ‚Äì 2022 ‚Äì From Mainstream Mania To Manic Depression 2021 marked a parabolic rise for Ethereum, breaking out beyond crypto circles into mainstream recognition. The parabolic rise also brought an abrupt peak, sending Ethereum prices crashing all throughout 2022 as the US Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates to the highest levels in decades. Key factors driving this bull run: Continued DeFi growth, with the total value locked in DeFi rising from $20B to over $100B during 2021. NFT mania beginning in early 2021, with Ethereum hosting headline-grabbing sales like Beeple‚Äôs $69 million digital art piece. Ethereum network upgrades like Berlin hard fork and London‚Äôs EIP-1559 built investor confidence. Large companies like Visa and JP Morgan began settling transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. Institutional investment rose with SEC allowing Ethereum futures ETFs. This perfect storm took ETH from under $800 in January 2021 to an all-time high of $4,800 in November 2021. In 2022 the crypto market endured a painful bear market, with Ethereum dropping below $1,000. However, a major milestone was reached in September 2022, with Ethereum completing The Merge upgrade to become a proof-of-stake blockchain. This reduced Ethereum inflation and carbon footprint. While sentiments remain low currently, The Merge was a huge technological leap cementing Ethereum‚Äôs lead in blockchain development. The stage is potentially set for the next bull market. Recent Ethereum Price Performance Unlike Bitcoin which found a local bear market bottom in November 2022, Ethereum set a local low in mid-June at around $878 per ETH. An almost immediate bounce took Ether over double from the low to $2,000, but retested $1,000 before the year ended. Throughout 2023 while Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have recovered, Ethereum‚Äôs rally has been relatively muted. In August 2023, Ethereum once again retested $1,500, possibly putting in a lower low before the start of a more substantial rally or collapse. Short Term Ethereum Price Prediction for 2023 Since the 2022 local bottom, Ethereum has been forming an Ascending Triangle pattern. This is predominantly a bullish pattern, but can occasionally appear in a bear market before the final move in a sequence, ultimately breaking down. Targets based on the measure rule put an immediate upside breakout around $3,800 per ETH, while a breakdown would send Ether back down to $871 for a double possible double bottom or new low. With only a few months left in 2023, trajectories will be limited based on time. Medium Term Ethereum Price Prediction for 2024 ‚Äì 2025 Based on historical 4-year market cycles and Elliott Wave Principle patterns, Ethereum appears to be at a critical junction, where it could retrace further and break down from a large rising wedge structure, or could rally and fill out the upper portion of the pattern one more time. The black-colored wave scenario puts ETHUSD at $10,000 between 2024 and 2025. Meanwhile, the red-colored corrective wave scenario suggests Ether will reach around $440 during a C-wave of continuation. Long Term Ethereum Price Prediction¬†for 2030 and Beyond If Ethereum establishes itself as the primary platform for decentralized apps and finance by 2030, its utility could be immense. Based on a long-term linear mean, Ethereum could fluctuate between $20,000 and nearly $100,000 per ETH by the year 2030 arrives. Ethereum Price Predictions by Experts Here what some industry experts and analysts forecast for Ethereum: Popular analyst Benjamin Cowen is conservative in his Ethereum price prediction, claiming that ‚ÄúEthereum has the potential to eventually achieve $10,000 to $15,000 per ETH in the next five to ten years.‚Äù He cautions that scaling needs to be achieved without diluting ETH‚Äôs value. RealVision CEO Raoul Pal predicts ETH at $20,000 by 2025. CertiK CEO Ronghui Gu forecasts Ethereum at $30,000 to $50,000 by 2030. Justin Bennett sees ETH potentially reaching $40,000 if bullish sentiment returns. Ethereum Price Prediction FAQs Here are some common questions about Ethereum price predictions: What was Ethereum‚Äôs lowest price? Ethereum hit record lows between $0.4 to $0.7 in 2015 and 2016 during its earliest days. Its recent low was around $800 in June 2022. What was Ethereum‚Äôs highest price? Ethereum‚Äôs all-time high price was $4,891 reached in November 2021. It also briefly exceeded $4,600 in the same month. How high can Ethereum realistically go long-term? Based on expert forecasts and models, Ethereum potentially could reach over $100,000 by 2030, and even $500,000+ in the 2050 timeframe as a bull case scenario if it achieves global adoption. Can Ethereum drop to zero? While unlikely, the possibility that Ethereum drops to near zero can‚Äôt be ruled out entirely. Competition, failure to scale sufficiently, or critical bugs in the codebase are threats. Why is Ethereum price volatile? As a relatively new asset class, Ethereum is prone to high volatility. Speculation, hype cycles, and changing investor sentiment amplify price swings. When will Ethereum‚Äôs price stabilize? Ethereum price volatility should stabilize significantly once it achieves full-scale mainstream adoption as a blockchain platform, which could happen within the next 5-10 years. Will Ethereum go up in 2023? The most likely scenario based on market trends is Ethereum rising gradually throughout 2023, although price will remain volatile in the short-term.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-price-prediction-for-2023-2024-2025-2030/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/16734111.jpeg

According to the case details, a US appeals court ruled on Tuesday, August 292r, that the SEC was wrong to reject an application from Grayscale to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a spot Bitcoin ETF. In the hours following the decision, Bitcoin jumped from $26,500 to test the $28,000 resistance zone. On-chain data has shown that the amount of BTC available for trading on crypto exchanges increased noticeably just before the verdict. This has sparked some rumors of insider trading, hinting that some investors knew about the Grayscale win beforehand and looked to capitalize on the oncoming Bitcoin price spike. A Surge In Bitcoin Supply On Exchanges Crypto trading expert Ali Martinez took to social media platform X to share a Santiment chart data detailing the spike in exchange supply. According to on-chain data, around 30,000 BTC was sent to crypto exchanges in the hours before the ruling, raising questions of market manipulation. This would take the exchange supply of BTC at the time from 1.13 million to 1.16 million.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) must review its rejection of Grayscale Investments' attempt to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF, a federal appeals court ruled on Tuesday. The legal victory potentially opens the door for a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S. Advocates have long argued that allowing this type of product would enable a greater swath of the general public to invest in bitcoin without having to go through the trouble of buying it directly or deal with potential issues like their custody providers collapsing. The SEC has disapproved every such ETF application it's reviewed to date, though a new swath of applicants are now hoping for success. Circuit Judge Neomi Rao, writing the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals' opinion, said that federal agencies are required to ""treat like cases alike."" The SEC did not explain why it was treating these products differently, she added, making the Grayscale denial ""arbitrary and capricious.‚Äù  Bitcoin (BTC) gained nearly 8%, topping $28,000 at one point on Tuesday afternoon after a federal appeals court ruled that the SEC must review its rejection of Grayscale Investments' attempt to convert its GBTC into an ETF. As has been typical with such rallies for many months, the crypto quickly gave back a chunk of those gains, with bitcoin trading just under $27,400 at press time, still up more than 5% over the past 24 hours. GBTC also saw its busiest trading session in 14 months, with nearly 20 million shares changing hands through the day, the most since the June 2022 crypto market crash, according to Yahoo data. The share price surged 18% to almost $21, the highest since bitcoin hit $31,000 in mid-July while the fund‚Äôs discount to net asset value (NAV) narrowed to as low as 15%, a level not seen since December 2021. Other movers included bitcoin cash (BCH), which has surged 15% over the last 24 hours. Stacks (STX), a bitcoin layer 2 protocol, was also a top gainer following the news, gaining 20% on the day. DCG, the parent company of Grayscale, also owns CoinDesk.  A tentative deal struck between defunct lender Genesis Global Capital (GGC) and parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG) faces opposition from a group of creditors who described in a Tuesday filing the treatment of over a billion dollars in outstanding loans as ‚Äúwholly insufficient.‚Äù Genesis' lending arm GGC filed for bankruptcy in January after a double whammy from the collapse of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and crypto exchange FTX. The wind-up has been delayed for months by talks over the contribution that DCG should make. An in-principle deal announced by Genesis on Tuesday saw DCG ‚Äì which is also CoinDesk‚Äôs parent company ‚Äì agreeing to a series of partial repayments to satisfy liabilities of $630 million in unsecured loans due in May 2023 and $1.1 billion due in 2032.",POSITIVE,BCH,BCH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,"Lyllah Ledesma, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/30/first-mover-americas-bitcoin-rallies-on-grayscale-court-win-over-sec,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ac7442adfcb8fc925aa2d91cdc3f0123be44a0df-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409777,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcPHzc,1693393516,"Sam Bankman-Fried's Allotted Prison Tech Is Inconvenient, but Fair: U.S. DOJ","Federal prosecutors are disputing former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried‚Äôs claims that his access to a special laptop and other court-ordered accommodations have done little to help him prepare his defense while he's confined to prison, a Tuesday court filing shows.  The letter to Judge Lewis Kaplan comes days after Bankman-Fried's lawyers requested that the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York provide their client with an internet-enabled laptop and access to a cellblock at the federal courthouse in Manhattan, N.Y. five days a week in the weeks leading up to his October trial.  Prosecutors argue, however, that the technological restrictions imposed on Bankman-Fried are merely ""inconveniences"" that have not hindered his defense preparation and are necessary as a result of his alleged ""witness tampering.""  ""The defendant's unlimited access to these resources was curtailed solely as a consequence of his own criminal activities while on bail,"" prosecutors said in the letter.  The prosecutors also noted Bankman-Fried's access to technological devices to review evidence against him already ""go[es] beyond the discovery access and review generally available to pretrial detainees.""  Bankman-Fried can use a laptop that is not connected to the internet while being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. He also has approval to work from an internet-enabled laptop with Microsoft Office, Excel, PowerPoint and Adobe Acrobat at a cellblock at the federal courthouse in Manhattan twice a week. However, the former executive has refused to return to that cellblock as he seeks more extensive pretrial release measures, prosecutors said in the filing.  The defense's complaints about the technology provided to their client come roughly a week after Judge Kaplan denied Bankman-Fried's request to visit his lawyers' offices in Manhattan for five days a week, during the lead up to the October trial.  The former FTX executive lost his bail earlier this month after Judge Kaplan ruled Bankman-Fried had circumvented his bail restrictions by attempting to intimidate former executives at his companies, including former Alameda Research co-CEO Caroline Ellison.  Bankman-Fried's access to technology is an issue that has been at the crux of several hearings leading up to the trial. Prosecutors previously complained about Bankman-Fried's use of a VPN and Google Drive while under house arrest at his parent's home in California, alleging those tools helped him tamper with the government's witnesses.  The DOJ has also asked the court to strike down Bankman-Fried's defence plan, calling the plan ""irrelevant"" without more details.",NEUTRAL,ÏóÜÏùå,TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Elizabeth Napolitano,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/08/30/sam-bankman-frieds-allotted-prison-tech-is-inconvenient-but-fair-us-doj,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/384d03e3c70c48bd6afc824b6cb8d2dd0f10dc53-1918x1079.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409776,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcPHt0,1693390836,Grayscale Victory Against SEC Clears Path for Spot Bitcoin ETFs: Bernstein,"Grayscale, the manager of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), has secured a second landmark win for the crypto industry against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), following Ripple‚Äôs favorable ruling last month, broker Bernstein said in a research report Tuesday.  A federal court ruled on Tuesday that the SEC must review its rejection of Grayscale‚Äôs attempt to convert the GBTC into an exchange-traded fund (ETF).  The ruling ‚Äúlikely clears the path for a spot bitcoin ETF,‚Äù and increases the chances that the SEC might approve all the current applications together, analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote.  ETFs are traded on an exchange, much like equities, and track the performance of an underlying asset. Their popularity has been growing because they allow market participants to invest in crypto without having to purchase the underlying digital assets themselves.  The court‚Äôs decision does not allow for the GBTC product to be converted into an ETF immediately, ‚Äúbut gives a fair basis for Grayscale to be treated in line with other Bitcoin ETF applicants,‚Äù the report said.  Likely dates for approval start next week for the first review, and continue into early 2024 for the final SEC review, the note said.

42409778,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcPI2v,1693389265,"It's a Bullish Double Whammy for Bitcoin, but Caution Still Warranted","For now, stars look to have aligned in favor of the bulls, thanks to Grayscale's legal victory over the SEC and the horribly weak U.S. JOLTS jobs report.  The SEC can still reject Grayscale's attempts to convert the trust into an ETF.  Continued weak U.S. data releases may trigger recession fears and weigh over risk assets.  Since late 2021, the crypto market has been starved of a positive double whammy or days when both crypto-specific and macroeconomic developments align with the bulls.  The past 24-hours have been one of those rare periods, thanks to crypto asset manager Grayscale's legal victory against a regulator and disappointing U.S. labor market data.  Grayscale and CoinDesk and both owned by Digital Currency Group (DCG).  A U.S. court on Tuesday asked the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to review its rejection of Grayscale's attempt to convert its trust into an exchange-traded fund (ETF).  Bitcoin rose over 6% to $28,000 following the court ruling, which raised hopes for an eventual launch of a spot-based ETF. Several experts say a spot-based ETF will likely open floodgates for mainstream money. Traditional finance giants like Blackrock have filed for a spot-based ETF.  ""This Blackrock iShares 'commodity' Bitcoin ETF will attract an allocation of $20-50bn over time, a calculated assumption given that Gold ETFs alone hold $100 billion,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport, said in a note to clients on Wednesday. ""The optimized, well-diversified (tactical) portfolio would allocate 21% to global equities, 42% to global fixed income (bonds, credit, loans, etc.), and 37% to alternatives ‚Äì including 10.6% to Bitcoin.""  The crypto market also received good news from the U.S. Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) survey, which showed vacancies dropped to the lowest level in over two years in July.  The data dented the appeal of the U.S. as a relatively strong economy, weakening the case for continued Federal Reserve (Fed) rate hikes and sent Treasury yields and the dollar lower. The dollar index fell by nearly 0.5% on Tuesday.  ""Recent data is eroding the narrative of U.S. resilience that had supported the rise of 10Y yields to above 4.3% over the past weeks. Poor job openings data and dipping consumer confidence yesterday saw the 10y falling through 4.2% and then briefly further towards 4.1% overnight,"" analysts at ING said in a note on Thursday.  The U.S. resiliency narrative and the resulting uptick in yields and the dollar index were among the key factors that catalyzed bitcoin's mid-August decline.  While the degree to which the JOLTS report contributed to bitcoin's rise on Tuesday is not known, the report has created a supportive environment for risk assets for now. Bitcoin's rise could have been more measured had the data bettered estimates.  ""Yesterday was a typical ‚Äòbad news is good news‚Äô day. Risk sentiment in the U.S. and across the globe was boosted by an unexpected dip in U.S. job openings to below 9 million jobs in July, the lowest levels since more than two years, and an unexpected fall in consumer confidence in August,"" Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote, said. ""The weak data pushed the Federal Reserve (Fed) hawks to the sidelines, and bolstered the expectation of a pause in September, and tilted the probabilities in favor of a no hike in November, as well.""  Caution still warranted  Caution might still be warranted on the part of the bulls as Grayscale's victory does not necessarily mean a spot-ETF launch is a done deal.  The SEC could come up with new reasons to reject Grayscale's bid to cover its trust into an ETF or request an en banc appeal. Later this week, the agency is expected to delay its decision on spot bitcoin ETF applications of Bitwise, BlackRock, VanEck, Fidelity, Invesco and Wisdomtree. Further, a new secret court filing related to leading digital assets exchange Binance has markets worried about more bad news.  Regarding broader market sentiment, risk-off may return if U.S. data continues to disappoint, stoking recession fears. The U.S. is the world's largest economy. Hence, a stateside recession could affect the global economy and investor risk appetite.  Traders may want to keep a close eye on how the Treasury yield curve reacts to potential weak data. Historically, it has de-inverted while heading into recessions, marking major tops in the S&P 500.

A tentative deal announced earlier this week is opposed by a sizable grouping of Genesis' creditors.  A tentative deal struck between defunct lender Genesis Global Capital (GGC) and parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG) faces opposition from a group of creditors who described in a Tuesday filing the treatment of over a billion dollars in outstanding loans as ‚Äúwholly insufficient.‚Äù  Genesis' lending arm GGC filed for bankruptcy in January after a double whammy from the collapse of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and crypto exchange FTX. The wind-up has been delayed for months by talks over the contribution that DCG should make.  An in-principle deal announced by Genesis on Tuesday saw DCG ‚Äì which is also CoinDesk‚Äôs parent company ‚Äì agreeing to a series of partial repayments to satisfy liabilities of $630 million in unsecured loans due in May 2023 and $1.1 billion due in 2032.

The lenders took exception to DCG and CEO Silbert being released from future legal claims, and threatened to block any final bankruptcy deal that incorporated the plans.  The filing accused Genesis and a formal committee that represents creditors of neglecting their fiduciary duty to maximize recoveries by agreeing to the DCG deal. Membership of the ad hoc lenders‚Äô grouping has not been made public, but the filing says they have a combined $2.4 billion in claims against GGC, including a majority of each class of claims asserted against it.  In the Tuesday filing that announced the deal, Genesis said it could result in recoveries of 70%-90% for unsecured creditors, and said that ‚Äúconstructive discussions‚Äù were ongoing with the lenders‚Äô grouping.

16728249,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549379,1693388400,Renowned Economist Explains Why Grayscale‚Äôs Win Is Not Good For Bitcoin Price,"One of the major highlights of Grayscale‚Äôs victory over the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was its positive effect on Bitcoin‚Äôs price. However, renowned economist Peter Schiff has explained why Grayscale‚Äôs win may not be good for Bitcoin in the long run. A GBTC ETF ‚ÄòBearish‚Äô For Bitcoin Schiff tweeted that the GBTC fund becoming a spot ETF (Exchange-traded Fund) is ‚Äúactually bearish‚Äù for the flagship cryptocurrency as he said this move could potentially increase Bitcoin‚Äôs ‚Äútradable supply.‚Äù Related Reading: Party In The USA: Ripple Gets Ready To Properly Celebrate Triumph Over SEC If approved, investors in the GBTC fund will now be able to redeem their Bitcoin, which Schiff has highlighted is bad for Bitcoin‚Äôs price and the market as GBTC will have to sell BTC into the market, thereby increasing the tradable supply. Schiff‚Äôs concern probably stems from the fact that GBTC reportedly owns over 3% of Bitcoin‚Äôs circulating supply, so a sell-off due to redemptions could significantly impact the market, causing Bitcoin‚Äôs price to reduce. However, other X (formerly Twitter) users quickly pointed out that other ETF applications will likely be approved alongside Grayscale‚Äôs application. As such, there will be enough demand to balance out the increase in supply that could result from Grayscale‚Äôs redemptions. Grayscale had applied to the SEC to convert its GBTC fund into a Spot Bitcoin ETF. However, the regulator rejected the application, leading Grayscale to file a lawsuit against the SEC, stating that the Commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously in its disapproval order. Following the Appeal court‚Äôs ruling in favor of Grayscale, the SEC now has to review the asset manager‚Äôs application again with the possibility of an approval higher this time. This is because Grayscale has been able to establish before the court that it should enjoy the same treatment given to Bitcoin Futures ETF which the Commission has had no problem approving. BTC price holds above $27,400 as euphoria spreads | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com The SEC‚Äôs Next Steps Legal expert Jake Chervinsky also chimed in to state that the court delivered a ‚Äúhuge embarrassment‚Äù for the SEC. As to the next steps that the regulator might take, Chervinsky highlighted four theories. Firstly, he believes the SEC could just pick another reason to deny Grayscale‚Äôs proposal, which could lead to another long-running legal battle between both parties. Apparently, the court had ruled that the Commission didn‚Äôt provide sufficient reason to deny Grayscale‚Äôs application as it faulted the ‚Äúsignificant market‚Äù test size as wrong. His second theory is that the SEC will choose to abide by the court‚Äôs decision and use that as an excuse to drop its ‚Äúanti-ETF position.‚Äù Related Reading: Bloomberg Expert Analyst Explains Why A Fall To $10,000 Isn‚Äôt Bad For Bitcoin Furthermore, the legal expert noted that the SEC may have no choice but to approve the pending ETF applications as there is ‚Äúpolitical pressure‚Äù on the SEC. According to him, the world‚Äôs largest asset manager, BlackRock, and its CEO, Larry Fink, are lobbying for their application to be approved. Lastly, Chervinsky believes that the SEC‚Äôs Chair Gary Gensler could use this to spin the anti-crypto narrative by approving these ETFs to show that the Commission is willing to approve products that abode by their regulations.

42409780,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcPICq,1693384572,"Grayscale Ruling Does Not Guarantee Bitcoin Spot ETF Approval, Traders Say","Bitcoin (BTC) prices surged some 7% on Tuesday after weeks of slumber as traders reacted to hopes of the long-contended Grayscale Bitcoin spot ETF getting approved in the U.S. following a court decision.  A federal appeals court ordered the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to ""vacate"" its rejection of the trust issuer's bid to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an exchange-traded fund. This could potentially open the door for a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S - even as the SEC has disapproved every such ETF application it's reviewed to date.  Grayscale and CoinDesk share the same parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG).  But while most market participants are rejoicing, some remain cautious about the optimism, draining out the current euphoria amongst loyalists.  ‚ÄúGrayscale obtained the chance of seeing their filing re-evaluated by the SEC as the causes of rejection did not seem fair to the judge,‚Äù said Matteo Greco, research analyst at Fineqia International (CSE:FNQ), in a note to CoinDesk Wednesday. ‚ÄúIt doesn't mean that now Grayscale will be 100% able to list a spot Bitcoin ETF, nor that this will happen in the future.‚Äù  ‚ÄúUndoubtedly this development is a strong positive signal for the market. However, final decisions on when and if Grayscale will be able to list its product as an ETF are yet to be made,‚Äù Greco added, pointing out that some 2.5 million bitcoin are held at a short-term loss that may serve as headwinds in the coming months.  ‚ÄúLooking at the bigger picture and analyzing the whole digital asset market, trading volume remains extremely low. The cumulated volume on centralized exchanges for the month of August totals roughly $400 billion, the lowest number since December 2020,‚Äù Greco stated.  Some, however, said that while the federal court‚Äôs decision doesn‚Äôt point to outright approval, it makes for the first steps of a changing regulatory environment.  ""While the decision does not yet mean that the first US bitcoin ETF will be approved, the court ruling It follows a pattern of legal escalation between regulators and digital asset players who have been giving solid arguments to support their case,‚Äù said Guilhem Chaumont, co-founder of trading firm Flowdesk in a message to CoinDesk.  ‚ÄúSo even if this is not the definitive end of this case, we would not be surprised to see this as the first in a series of positive news about regulatory adoption in the US,‚Äù Chaumont added.  As such, long-term holders of bitcoin have shown a continued accumulation of the tokens despite a recent billion-dollar shakeout, suggesting a bullish outlook in the longer term remains intact among traders regardless of the current market lull.

The court‚Äôs decision suggests that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) erred in its rejection of Grayscale‚Äôs application for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). This development has once again underscored the impact of positive regulatory news on the sentiment and valuation of the cryptocurrency market.

Regulatory Reassurance Boosts BCH, Overall Market Confidence The crypto market has long been susceptible to fluctuations driven by regulatory uncertainty. However, instances of regulatory clarity, such as the latest ruling regarding Grayscale‚Äôs ETF application, have repeatedly shown their potential to galvanize positive sentiment among investors. The maturation and legitimacy that regulatory approvals signify are often interpreted as promising indicators for the industry‚Äôs future growth. This enhanced sentiment invariably piques interest not only in Bitcoin but also in various alternative cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash Seizes The Momentum With Bitcoin Cash exhibiting a robust price rally, the digital asset‚Äôs value soared to $217, as reported by CoinGecko. Over the span of 24 hours, the coin witnessed an impressive surge of 14.8%, which further expanded to 16% over the course of the past week. BCH price action today.

BCH market cap at $4.2 billion today. Chart: TradingView.com The Bitcoin Effect On Altcoins Bitcoin, as the vanguard of cryptocurrencies, continues to wield substantial influence over the market. The surge in its price to $27,456‚Äîan increase of more than 5% within a single day‚Äîepitomizes the profound impact of Grayscale‚Äôs triumph over the SEC. What makes this rally even more intriguing is its domino effect on altcoins like Bitcoin Cash. As investors seek to diversify their portfolios, they inevitably explore alternative cryptocurrencies to maximize their potential gains. This trend has triggered a surge in interest and investment in altcoins, propelling them to new heights.

Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to multiple counts of fraud after his crypto exchange collapsed in November 2022, and counsel are currently engaged in skirmishes over the exact terms of his October trial.  ‚ÄúThe Court should preclude irrelevant, confusing, and prejudicial questioning, evidence, and arguments about the involvement of attorneys‚Äù if no further details are provided, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in the filing, arguing Bankman-Fried should specify the legal advice or abandon his proposed defense.

Williams made similar remarks about the use of auto-deleting Signal messages by FTX staff, and the drafting of loan agreements which the government says actually used customer money, after Bankman-Fried indicated he was planning to pin blame on his former counsel at the Fenwick & West law firm as part of his defense.

Currently, it‚Äôs down a staggering 91% from its all-time high (ATH) of $0.00008845, recorded in October 2021. Over the past year, the token has been on a consistent downtrend, marking lower highs and lower lows on the monthly time frame. But all is not bleak for SHIB investors. The recent relaunch of Shibarium, a layer 2 blockchain, is a beacon of hope. This move is seen as Shiba Inu‚Äôs attempt to transition from its meme coin status to a more serious player in the crypto world, aiming to enable applications for millions across a vast ecosystem. Shiba Inu Faces A Double-Edged Sword From a technical chart analysis perspective, there‚Äôs another glimmer of hope: the formation of a triple bottom pattern. This pattern, if validated, could signal the end of SHIB‚Äôs two-year-long downtrend. However, it‚Äôs a double-edged sword. If invalidated, this pattern could morph into a descending triangle, potentially pushing SHIB to new lows. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Community Celebrates New Milestone One Day After Shibarium Goes Public A closer look at SHIB‚Äôs weekly chart reveals the formation of this triple bottom pattern. A triple bottom is a bullish chart pattern. It‚Äôs characterized by three roughly equal lows bouncing off a support level, followed by a breakout above the resistance. This visual pattern indicates a shift in power from sellers (bears) to buyers (bulls). Remarkably, the formation of a triple bottom is often seen as an opportunity for traders to enter a bullish position, especially after a prolonged bearish trend, as is the case with SHIB. A few rules typically qualify triple bottoms. An existing downtrend should precede the pattern. SHIB checks this box. Second, the three lows should be roughly equal in price, allowing for a horizontal trendline. SHIB fits this criterion as well. Third, the volume should decrease throughout the pattern, indicating weakening bears, while bullish volume should surge as the price breaks through the final resistance. The chart highlights this for SHIB. To delve deeper into the specifics: SHIB‚Äôs first bottom was recorded when it dropped to the $0.00000715 mark in June 2022. A subsequent recovery was short-lived, causing SHIB to fall to its second bottom at $0.00000781 in December 2021. The third bottom was formed at $0.0000060 in June 2023, after another recovery attempt faced resistance and marked a lower high. Related Reading: Shibarium Is Live And Scaling, What‚Äôs Ahead For Shiba Inu Price? However, the danger lies in the striking similarity between the triple bottom and the descending triangle. If the support at $0.00000715 breaks, SHIB could validate the descending triangle and target its previous yearly low at $0.000006. Holding this level is crucial; otherwise, SHIB might enter uncharted territory. It‚Äôs worth noting that traders often seek confirmation of a triple bottom using other technical indicators. An oversold Relative Strength Index (RSI) is one such indicator. Currently, SHIB‚Äôs weekly RSI stands at 45 (neutral), leaning more towards the possibility of a descending triangle pattern. But if the triple bottom plays out, the rewards could be substantial. The first major target for SHIB could be the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.00002545, translating to a potential gain of approximately 200% from its current price.

EOS was granted whitelist approval by the Japan Virtual and Crypto Asset Exchange Association (JVCEA), a self-regulated body of crypto exchanges in the country that works towards protecting investors.  The token can now traded against the Japanese yen on regulated cryptocurrency exchanges in Japan. It joins the ranks of a select few tokens, such as bitcoin, ether and monacoin, that are offered on the country's exchanges. EOS will begin trading in mid-September on BitTrade, a premier cryptocurrency marketplace licensed and regulated by the country's Financial Services Agency (FSA).  Under the Payment Services Act, the JVCEA and FSA closely monitor and regulate crypto-asset providers, requiring a thorough pre-screening process for new token listings.  ""Securing regulatory approval from the JVCEA is a monumental achievement for EOS, affirming our steadfast commitment to compliance,"" said Yves La Rose, CEO of the EOS Network Foundation, in a note to CoinDesk. ""This landmark approval ushers in new prospects for EOS in the Japanese market, fostering stronger connections with discerning businesses and developers seeking robust blockchain solutions, in particular within the gaming industry.""

Ahead of the pivotal ruling nearly 30,000 BTC, worth $822 million at the current market price of $27,400, were moved to addresses tied to centralized exchanges, according to data tracked by analytics firm Santiment. The ruling led to a 6% surge in bitcoin prices pushing the top cryptocurrency to $28,000.  Perhaps some traders anticipated the price boost and prepared for the same in advance by moving coins to exchanges. Investors typically move coins to exchanges when they are intending to liquidate holdings or deploy their coins as margin for derivative trading. Hence, an uptick in exchange inflows is often seen as a harbinger of price turbulence.  ""The exchange supply of bitcoin was boosted significantly just prior to Grayscale's win over the SEC. It looks quite clear that the powers that be knew of the inevitable boost in crypto market capitalization as a result of this outcome,"" Santiment tweeted, echoing onchain analyst Ali Martinez's comment.  Addresses-based onchain metrics are subject to labeling issues. Hence, drawing definite conclusions from the same is challenging.  Mean inflows and outflows surge  Data tracked by South Korea-based CryptoQuant shows the mean inflow or amount of BTC transferred to exchanges per transaction rose to 1.146, the highest since June 21, as prices rallied to $28,000.  An uptick in the mean inflow indicates investors are sending a large number of coins in a transaction, a hint of potential selling pressure.  However, that's not necessarily the case this time, as mean outflows also jumped to two-month highs and the net balance held on exchanges, especially those offering spot trading, declined.  ""Reserves held on U.S.-based spot exchanges continue to decrease while reserves on offshore exchanges, offering derivatives trading continue to increase.

16717279,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549348,1693360843,"Base Network Gears Up For USDC Integration, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire Confirms","Circle‚Äôs CEO Jeremy Allaire has announced that USDC will be launched natively on the Base Network platform next week. Allaire took to social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) to share this news, emphasizing the benefits and implications of this integration. Circle also confirmed the announcement, stating that USDC issued by Circle will be considered the official form of USDC for the Base Network ecosystem. They further highlighted that native USDC will gradually replace the currently circulating bridged USDbC liquidity that originates from Ethereum. Base Network‚Äôs Native USDC Integration To Attract Capital? The integration of native USDC on Base Network offers numerous advantages for users and developers alike. Key among these benefits is the expansion of liquidity, as native USDC gains traction within the ecosystem. Related Reading: Ethereum In Bleak Situation? Sharks & Whales Continue 4-Month Long Selloff An important aspect of the integration is the potential replacement of bridged USDbC (USD Coin on Ethereum) liquidity. Base Network aims to establish a ‚Äúself-sustaining‚Äù ecosystem, where transactions and value transfers occur natively within the network. Per the announcement, by reducing reliance on external bridges, the integration of native USDC enhances efficiency, security, and scalability, resulting in a more streamlined and user-friendly experience. Notably, the migration process from bridged USDbC to native USDC will be managed by Base Network in collaboration with ecosystem apps to ensure a seamless transition of liquidity. In addition to the expected boost to the network‚Äôs financial infrastructure, the integration of native USDC aims to create new opportunities for developers to leverage stablecoin functionality within their decentralized applications (dApps). This integration is also expected to simplify the integration of fiat currency and cryptocurrency for institutional investors, further broadening the appeal and utility of Coinbase‚Äôs Base. Importantly, the integration of native USDC will not immediately impact Base Bridge, which will continue to operate ‚Äúnormally‚Äù, ensuring uninterrupted functionality for users, according to the announcement made on Monday. Overall, The impending integration of the stablecoin on the Base Network marks an important development for the decentralized ecosystem. The introduction of USDC brings potential benefits such as enhanced liquidity, streamlined value transfer, and increased opportunities for developers. While the transition from bridged USDbC to native USDC may present challenges, Base Network is committed to managing the migration process effectively and addressing any concerns. As the launch of native Circle USD on Base Network approaches, industry participants eagerly anticipate its potential impact on liquidity dynamics and the broader cryptocurrency landscape.

16714414,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549342,1693353623,"Grayscale‚Äôs Win Breathes Life Into Litecoin, Post-Halving Rally On?","In a refreshing ruling on August 29, the United States District of Columbia Court of Appeals said the stringent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was, after all, wrong in denying Grayscale to convert their over-the-counter (OTC) Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF). The regulator had previously¬†barred the conversion of the GBTC to an ETF, citing an alleged absence of measures to prevent price manipulation, forcing Grayscale to sue. Before this ruling, the presiding judge said SEC needed to elaborate on why they denied Grayscale‚Äôs application. Litecoin Rebounds Following today‚Äôs court statement, Bitcoin prices soared, and the aftermath of this pump has positively impacted Litecoin. As it is, BTC is up roughly 10%, sharply rebounding from around $25,800 support recorded last week. Meanwhile, LTC, the bitcoin ‚Äúsilver,‚Äù is up 7% when writing, aiming to reverse losses of August 17. Litecoin is changing hands at around $70, with a noticeable increment in trading volumes. Typically, in crypto trading, a spike in volumes, regardless of trend direction, can point to engagement and provide a ‚Äúhint‚Äù of traders‚Äô sentiment. With rising volumes and expanding prices, it could suggest that bulls are positioning themselves for even more gains in the sessions ahead. Meanwhile, sharp losses with increasing volumes may mean bears are unloading, and prices may drop. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Signal: Exchange Netflow Remains Negative Post-Halving Rally On? The expansion in LTC trading volumes, as visible in the daily chart, could translate to a possible bottom for the digital asset that has been under pressure in the past few sessions. To illustrate, LTC is down 26% in August 2023 alone. This dump is despite news of the Litecoin network halving its miner rewards to 6.25 LTC in early August. In crypto, halving events has historically been associated with fresh cycles of increasing demand for the underlying coin. For Bitcoin, past performances indicate that the coin tends to rally months after the halving event. Meanwhile, in Litecoin, it has been mixed, but spot prices are generally higher than in 2019 when it halved. With Grayscale igniting demand in Bitcoin and other proof-of-work altcoins like Litecoin, it is yet to be seen whether bulls will build on this and push prices, especially of LTC, higher.¬†LTC prices are currently trending inside the August 17 bear candlestick. Technically, this is bearish from volume analysis. A sharp reversal and rally, ideally above $75, peeling back August 17 losses, might catalyze more demand, potentially setting the base for a relieving post-halving rally.

42409792,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcPIgb,1693353600,Tornado Cash Indictments May Prove to Be Just a Localized Storm After All,"The Tornado Cash indictments are being viewed by many as another tipping point for crypto. In that view, how the case plays out could define how the federal government can deal with decentralized trading platforms if they‚Äôre seen as broad precedents. But the case may be much more straightforward than initial reactions suggested.  You‚Äôre reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Tornado Crash  The narrative  Roman Storm, one of the three co-founders and developers behind the Tornado Cash mixer, was arrested last week. A second, Roman Semenov, has also been indicted. A third, Alexey Pertsev, faces trial in The Netherlands, where he was arrested last year.  Why it matters  Are law enforcement officials and federal governments going after Tornado Cash in an effort to tamp down on all efforts to make crypto transactions private? Or is the case a much more straightforward one about running a website that allowed North Korea to launder hundreds of millions of dollars‚Äô worth of crypto?  Breaking it down  So by now you‚Äôve seen that the U.S. Department of Justice brought charges against Roman Storm and Roman Semenov, two of the co-founders of Tornado Cash. One ‚Äì Storm ‚Äì was arrested last week, is now out on bail and will appear before a judge in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York next week.  The indictments and arrest drew alarm from the crypto ecosystem, with concerned individuals decrying what they saw as efforts to regulate the very development and deployment of software intended to guarantee privacy in transactions.  First: A disclaimer that we don‚Äôt yet have all the facts in the case. The DOJ hasn‚Äôt presented much beyond an indictment with allegations, and some of the allegations need important details to contextualize the arguments, as we‚Äôll get into.  As far as the allegations themselves go, there are some facts that aren‚Äôt really great for the industry: the DOJ alleged that Storm and Semenov created a program and user interface that allowed for malicious actors to launder up to $1 billion in crypto ‚Äì including North Korea‚Äôs Lazarus Group, which allegedly moved ‚Äúhundreds of millions‚Äù through the mixer (leading to last year‚Äôs sanctions).  ‚ÄúThese are individuals who were allegedly helping North Korea with economic transactions, allegedly in aid of a nuclear weapons program. Those are really, really serious allegations,‚Äù said Anand Sithian, a former financial crimes prosecutor now with Crowell & Moring.  But even if the actions alleged by the government are true and Tornado Cash was used to launder money to North Korea making crypto live down to its reputation as being a tool for the dregs of humanity, the charges against the three accused are very specific and this case may not be an indictment of the industry as a whole or a power grab over privacy tools.  The charges themselves ‚Äì conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money services business, conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (in other words, violate sanctions) are all based on agreements between the indicted parties.  ‚ÄúCertainly, the government will want to prove the substantive charge, that he actually did these things, but did these two individuals come to a meeting of the minds as to the conduct that is alleged to violate these federal statutes? That is what the government is going to have to prove,‚Äù he said.  It may also be difficult to distinguish between the time period where the developers had control over Tornado Cash from when they didn‚Äôt, he noted. Tornado Cash‚Äôs developers famously burned their keys, arguing they no longer had the ability to unilaterally change the smart contract code.  ‚ÄúIt's really hard to decipher if the government actually believes that they gave up control,‚Äù he said. But, this issue may only apply to the money services business charge.  Moreover, the DOJ seems to be specifically arguing that it was the user interface at issue, rather than the smart contract itself, said Craig Timm, a senior director of anti-money laundering at the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists (ACAMS).  ‚ÄúYou've got to think about it sort of separate in your mind, the Tornado Cash smart contract from the user interface in the website, because I think that's exactly what the Department of Justice is doing,‚Äù he said.  It seems unlikely the charges would be brought if there was no user interface, he added.  Tornado Cash‚Äôs native TORN token is another complicating factor, Sithian said. According to the indictment, the defendants used the token to profit off of the operation of Tornado Cash as a service. The filing cites messages they sent to each other, where they allegedly discussed the need to pump TORN‚Äôs price.  They converted their TORN token holdings into stablecoins, with Storm advising Semenov and Pertsev to create new wallets and further move the funds around, the indictment said. This allegation that the accused were using Tornado Cash to pad their own accounts is another serious blow against the accused and would again seem to argue that the indictment is more narrowly tailored than an attempt to rein in the industry.  The idea that ‚Äúthey were in the business of making money off really bad actors [is] a compelling argument for a jury,‚Äù he said. It can help prosecutors provide a reason for why Storm and Semenov were working on Tornado Cash, as opposed to the more altruistic argument that they just wanted to defend privacy.  Timm echoed this view, saying that prosecutors don‚Äôt need to prove a motive but prosecutors would typically share one anyway for the jury.  ‚ÄúWhat [the DOJ has] done here is lay out a bunch of evidence to try to paint the picture that these guys weren't just in it for software or development, they just weren't good Samaritans here,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey were in this for money, and in fact, they were deceptive with their community about the money they were making [and] how they were profiting.‚Äù  Coin Center, an industry group, took a competing view, saying the indictment‚Äôs allegations suggest that Storm and Semenov remained within parameters defined by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).  ‚ÄúThe allegations include that the defendants: (a) paid for web hosting services for a user interface that allowed users to send transaction messages to the underlying smart contracts, (b) paid for a software repository (Github) where smart contract and user interface software and documentation was hosted, and (c) had (for a time before May 2020) ‚Äúcomplete control‚Äù over the Tornado Cash smart contracts,‚Äù research director Peter Van Valkenburgh said in a blog post.  FinCEN‚Äôs guidance went on to say that the publisher of anonymizing software would not be treated like a money transmitter. Storm and Semonov, if they were only the publishers of the Tornado Cash software, shouldn‚Äôt be treated like the operators, Van Valkenburgh wrote.  Some parts of the case may hinge around the question of whether the defendants controlled Tornado Cash as a service.  Timm said the DOJ is trying to argue that Tornado Cash wasn‚Äôt decentralized, that it was a centralized entity running a website and trying to profit off of the service being provided.  ‚ÄúThe allegations aren't aimed at the smart contract. They're aimed at the user interface where they could have done any number of things that could have shut it down, they could have put controls in it, they could have done any of these things once they knew criminal money is here, but they didn't,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd they knew that their system was then designed to conceal it and make it easier for the criminals to move that money.‚Äù  Van Valkenburgh wrote that to Coin Center‚Äôs knowledge, the defendants never had the ability to directly access user funds, which would again suggest they weren‚Äôt violating FinCEN guidance for money transmitters.  The details about exchanges that were hacked reaching out to the developers for assistance and being turned away may play in here.  Of course, what we don‚Äôt know is whether the developers said they couldn‚Äôt help the hacked exchanges or if they wouldn‚Äôt help the hacked exchanges. If they said they couldn‚Äôt because they didn‚Äôt have control over the smart contract or any aspect of the user interface that would have allowed them to help, that‚Äôs one story. If they said they wouldn‚Äôt help, but could have, that‚Äôs an entirely different one.
