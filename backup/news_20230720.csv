15120515,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=543529,1689894015,Bullish Signal: Whales Accumulate Massive Amounts Of ARB,"Through the bear market, Arbitrum (ARB) has been one of the tokens that have managed to hold on to a significant amount of its all-time high value. Along these same lines, the digital asset is one of the few tokens currently flashing a green bullish flag, and accumulation has ramped up as a result of this. ARB Whale Accumulation Ramps Up Transactions on the Arbitrum blockchain on Thursday, July 20, point to massive accumulation among large investors. These transactions were flagged by on-chain data tracker Lookonchain, going as far back as July 17 when the accumulation trend seemed to have begun. Related Reading: Why This Upcoming Event Is Bearish For Axie Infinity (AXS) On Monday, Lookonchain reported three transactions carrying 3.76 million ARB worth $5 million at the time from the Binance exchange to known whale wallets. While these transactions were significant, they did not stop there. The following day, July 18, the tracker spotted another transaction carrying 4 million ARB. The source of the transaction was the same, with the coins which were worth $5 million at the time being moved from Binance to a private wallet. The most recent whale accumulation happened on Wednesday, July 19, with the largest ARB withdrawals of the bunch. This time around, a whale identified as “0x6950” withdrew 4.6 million ARB worth $5.84 million at the time of the transaction, from Binance. Whale”0x6950″ withdrew 4.6M $ARB ($5.84M) from #Binance again just now. The whale has withdrawn a total of 9M $ARB ($11.4M) from #Binance in the past 2 days.https://t.co/E9GCmJ7ftc pic.twitter.com/FNI1gBbxrd — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 19, 2023 All of these transactions point to a consistent accumulation trend among these large holders, which could suggest that they expect a price recovery to happen soon. Their withdrawals have also reduced the amount of selling pressure on the digital asset and this could also lend support to any rally from here on out. Arbitrum Continues To Dominate Layer 2 Blockchains Arbitrum has seen much success in the market and this contributes to the bullishness around its native ARB token. Arbitrum currently boasts the largest Total Value Locked (TVL) of all the Ethereum Layer 2 blockchains, including Polygon and Optimism. Related Reading: Back In The Game: Ripple Joins $54 Million Funding Round For Metaverse Startup While Polygon and Optimism TVLs are sitting at $1.027 billion and $926 million, respectively, the TVL of the Arbitrum network is at $2.68 billion. This figure makes the L2 the fourth-largest by TVL across all blockchains, coming up behind heavy hitters such as Ethereum, Tron, and BSC. With Arbitrum controlling a significant portion of the L2 TVL, expectations are that its native token will also surge alongside it. Currently, ARB is trading at $1.29 with a 3.33% price gain in the last 24 hours. However, the price could easily surge toward $1.5 if whale accumulations continue and sell pressure continues to decline.

42410147,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcTyGd,1689890111,U.S. House Republicans Introduce Crypto Oversight Bill With Changes From June Draft,"U.S. House Republicans introduced a new digital assets oversight bill on Thursday that aims to establish a regulatory framework to protect investors in the crypto sector.  “Today's introduction of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act marks a significant milestone in the House Committees on Agriculture and Financial Services efforts to establish a much-needed regulatory framework that protects consumers and investors and fosters American leadership in the digital asset space,” said Chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture Rep. Glenn “GT” Thompson (R-Pa.) in a statement.  The bill, one of several introduced in recent years that aim to create comprehensive rules for digital assets, comes at a time when a perceived lack of regulatory clarity and a wave of aggressive enforcement actions are spurring established crypto businesses to consider leaving the U.S., and deterring startups from forming there.  Thursday's bill, first drafted in early June, aims to lay down a regulatory path for crypto exchanges to register with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and would enable them to trade digital securities, commodities and stablecoins all in one place.  “The crypto industry wants clarity and our collaborative bill gives both the CFTC and SEC a seat at the table. Our bill establishes clear principles to ensure financial security and certainty as digital asset developers continue to innovate,” said Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.) in the statement.  Gabriel Shapiro, general counsel of Delphi Labs, noted a change from the June discussion draft that in his view ""completely alters the value prop[osition] of the bill"" and would reintroduce the ambiguity it seeks to resolve.  On page 10, the revised bill excludes from the definition of ""digital assets"" a range of traditional securities such as stocks, bonds, ""transferable share[s],"" ""certificate[s] of interest or participation in any profit-sharing agreement,"" and so on.  As a result, Shapiro wrote on Twitter, a range of assets found in the decentralized finance (DeFi) market, such as Compound's cTokens or Liquid Collective's Liquid Staking Tokens, ""would be highly regulated under this provision even if [they are] not under current law.""  ""The SEC can still go on the warpath...all they have to do is argue that a token is a 'transferable share' 'a profit interest' etc.,"" he warned.

It has seen significant gains since May 2023. Despite volatility and regulatory challenges, factors such as inflation data and past performance suggest potential for higher crypto prices in the coming months. However, cryptocurrencies remain a high-risk asset class due to potential legislation, opposition from traditional financial institutions, and market cap fluctuations. On May 18, 2023, in a Seeking Alpha article on the Bitwise Crypto Innovators ETF product ( BITQ ), I wrote, BITQ is an ETF that provides exposure to Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency asset class without the need for crypto wallets or accounts at Coinbase ( COIN ) or other crypto trading platforms. At under $7 per share, BITQ is an inexpensive product for those looking to dip a toe into the cryptocurrency arena. Like any crypto, only invest funds that you are willing to lose as the risks of loss are commensurate with the significant profit potential. BITQ was trading at $6.90 per share on May 18. Since then, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) moved to higher highs, and BITQ followed on the upside. Crypto volatility will likely continue, and the price swings could be hair-raising. BITQ rose 116% from the December 2022 low to the May 18 price level. Since then, BITQ has made higher highs, with the ETF above the $10 per share level on July 20. Consolidation continues in Bitcoin and cryptos with an upward bias Bitcoin's bearish plunge ended in November 2022 at $15,516.53 per token. Three-Year Bitcoin Chart (Barchart) As the chart highlights, Bitcoin recovered to its most recent $31,765.71 high on July 13. While the leading cryptocurrency has made higher highs since the November 2022 bottom, it has been consolidating around the $30,000 level. Bitcoin has not broken above its critical technical resistance at the mid-2022 $32,329.54 high. Bitcoin has traded with an upward bias, but the $30,000 level has become a pivot point. Five-Year Ethereum Price Chart (Barchart) Ethereum (ETH-USD) reached its $883.159 low before Bitcoin in June 2022. While the second-leading crypto has also displayed a bullish bias, the $2,000 level has developed into Ethereum's pivot point. The case for higher crypto prices Since Bitcoin burst on the scene in 2010 at five cents per token, boom-and-bust price action has been the norm. After the November 2021 through November 2022 Bitcoin bust, another boom period that leads to an eventual new high would not be a surprise. The following factors favor higher crypto prices over the coming months: The track record supports a continuation of higher highs. Bitcoin and Ethereum reached significant technical bottoms in 2022. The latest inflation data suggests the Fed will curb its enthusiasm for interest rate hikes. In a stable or even falling rate environment, cryptocurrencies could attract more investment interest as the yields on fixed-income assets stabilize. The cost of carrying Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other tokens is a function of the interest rate environment. Given past performance, investors could flock to cryptocurrencies seeking significant capital appreciation as prices consolidate. In a win for cryptos and a loss for regulators, a judge recently ruled that Ripple (XRP-USD), the fourth-leading cryptocurrency by market cap worth over $41.6 billion, was not itself necessarily a security. However, the victory was partial as the judge ruled that institutional buyers count as unregistered sales of securities. The ruling went against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Cryptos remain uncharted territory for regulators and legislators, and the ruling put a roadblock in front of the SEC and other regulatory bodies. The case for failure Cryptos continue to have many high-profile and influential detractors. The case for failure includes: The potential for legislation that bans the assets remains high. Cryptos threaten the government's control of the money supply. As purse string control is a significant power, expect Congress, the administration, and other governments to fight the asset class tooth and nail. Crypto ideology is the asset class that operates globally and without government intervention. Therefore, any regulations run contrary to crypto's philosophical basis. Regulators are not likely to surrender their crusade after the recent XRP ruling. The asset class's market cap dropped from over $3 trillion in late 2021 to $1.2 trillion in July 2023. The higher the market cap climbs, the more regulators and legislators will sound the systemic risk alarm, prompting curbs on the burgeoning asset class. Traditional bankers and financial institutions may offer some crypto products to customers, but the asset class is contrary to the institutions' best interests and future profitability. Opposition from government and private sector institutions creates significant roadblocks for the cryptocurrency asset class. Meanwhile, the high-profile failure of FTX and the case against Sam Bankman-Fried may only increase opposition later this year when the case goes to trial. BITQ owns Bitcoin and crypto-related companies On May 18, the Bitwise Crypto Innovators ETF product was at the $6.90 per share level. One of the benefits of the ETF, aside from owning a Bitcoin-correlated product without needing a crypto wallet or holding the assets on an exchange platform, is the ETF and its holdings are SEC regulated. On July 20, BITQ's holdings included: Top holdings of the BITQ ETF Product (Seeking Alpha) As the chart shows, the mix of holdings has changed since May, with Coinbase and Riot ( RIOT ) investments reflecting 21.99% of the assets under management. In May, BITQ had 13.08% of its assets invested in the platform and miner. On May 18, COIN was at the $60.26 per share level. At $101.20 on July 20, it was 67.9% higher. On the same day, RIOT traded at $11.07 per share and rallied 66.3% to $18.41 on July 20. Chart of the BITQ ETF Product (Barchart) The chart illustrates BITQ's appreciation from $6.90 on May 18 to $10.02 on July 20, a 45.2% gain. At the most recent $11.34 July 14 high, the BITQ ETF moved 64.3% higher. Bitcoin settled at $26,726.45 on May 18. At $29,698.05 on July 20, it was 11.1% higher. Ethereum at $1,797.292 on May 18 rallied 4.9% to $1,885.12 on July 20. COIN, RIOT, and BITQ outperformed the leading cryptos since mi-May. While there are never any guarantees in markets, the ETF, platform, and mining company provided significant upside leverage over the past months. At $10.02 on July 20, BITQ had $113.53 million in assets under management. The liquid ETF trades an average of 174,576 shares daily and charges an 0.85% management fee. Only invest capital you are willing to lose The significant price variance, uncertain regulatory and legislative futures, and track record of cryptocurrencies make them some of the riskiest assets in history. The potential for substantial returns comes with significant and commensurate risks. As the downside potential is zero, only invest funds that you are willing to lose in Bitcoin, Ethereum, any crypto token, or crypto-related companies or ETF products. While the recent trends are bullish, and the potential is for higher highs, a total loss remains the asset class's overwhelming risk.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4618580-bitq-significant-returns-in-the-crypto-etf?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/15118415.jpeg

42410139,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcTxwn,1689887566,Meme Coins Like PEPE and DOGE Are Anything but a Joke,"Meme coins: a term that generates both amusement and disdain within the crypto community.  The wild journey of pepecoin (PEPE), from joke to somewhat established project, perfectly encapsulates the excitement and unpredictability that come with this breed of digital assets.  Yonathan Lapchik is the CEO of Web3 company Suku.     It’s time we started taking meme coins more seriously. These assets, propelled by social media hype and born out of internet culture, attract a flood of newcomers to crypto. Left unchecked, meme coins can reinforce misconceptions about the broader crypto landscape.  They are both a catalyst for the mass adoption of Web3 technologies and a potential barrier that could perpetuate confusion and skepticism among outsiders, and give regulators false notions about what the industry stands for.  The allure of meme coins  The meteoric rise of meme coins – dogecoin (DOGE), shiba inu (SHIB) and PEPE, to name a few – has been nothing short of a spectacle. These digital assets have become a fascinating gateway to the uncharted world of Web3 for a growing number of people.  Meme coins blend internet humor and gambling, which draw people in from all walks of life by promising astronomical returns. To some extent, meme coins are one of the most important drivers of mainstream Web3 adoption.  The allure of these coins extends beyond their comical origins or potential for quick profit. They effectively level the playing field in the often daunting world of cryptocurrencies, sparking intrigue among anyone who may have previously viewed this realm as the exclusive territory of tech-savvy investors and financial gurus. They give hope, too, to the many people interested in bitcoin who feel like they missed their moment to invest.  None of this is to suggest that investing in meme coins is wise. In fact, the best thing that could happen, is that a newcomer to crypto brought in by cryptodickbutt or SHIB will learn about the true innovation happening in Web3, the potentials of different decentralized applications (dapps) and the importance of self custody. It’s not wishful thinking, but a common crypto pipeline.  See also: Investors Track Pepecoin Whales to Cash In on Meme Coin Mania as Wider Market Stagnates  In many ways, meme coins have turned passive internet users into active participants in the DeFi landscape, encouraging them to explore, learn and interact with blockchain technologies firsthand. Nevertheless, this fun, democratized on-ramp has its share of tribulations.  The dark side of the meme coin  The inherent volatility and unpredictability of meme coins is a significant concern, especially when influencers spew empty promises of astronomical returns. While tales of overnight millionaires and gargantuan profits might grab headlines, the flip side is an equally abrupt potential for losses. As the saying goes, “what goes up must come down.”  Meme coins have been subject to wild price swings, driven by factors as small as a social media post or a change in sentiment within their communities when milestones in the roadmap appear to have no tangible progress.  Moreover, the fundamentals of these assets are often questionable. Unlike traditional blockchains such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, many meme coins lack intrinsic value or a concrete use-case, meaning their prices are fueled largely by hype rather than technological innovation or real-world utility.  Meme coin creators rarely try to hide this either. For instance, at the bottom of pepecoin’s landing page, it states, “The coin is completely useless and for entertainment purposes only.” This overt lack of utility raises valid concerns about the sustainability of their growth, with many in the crypto community questioning whether the meme coin boom can endure in the long term or if it's merely a speculative bubble bound to burst.  Adding to these challenges is the potential and inevitability of market manipulation. In the absence of regulation, meme coins can be exploited in pump-and-dump schemes, where influencers or large investors artificially inflate the price before selling off their holdings, leaving average investors to bear the brunt of the crash.  Further, every massive gain comes at the expense of most people taking large losses. This is referred to as “bag holding,” where traders miss the optimal window to sell and are left holding a portfolio of devalued or, in most cases, worthless coins. This is where the term “PvP,” or player versus player, within the crypto community comes from.  The fact that it’s called playing emphasizes the competitive nature of meme coin trading and also invokes the image of a high-stakes game of chicken, where participants vie against each other, attempting to predict who will be the first to dump their tokens.  These aspects of meme coins have muddied the waters of the crypto space, often leading to misconceptions and reinforcing skeptical statements such as “all crypto is a scam.” As such, to most rational users in the space, meme coins represent significant hurdles to widespread adoption and acceptance of decentralized technologies.  See also: 'It's Part and Parcel of Crypto': How Memes Drive Web3 Narratives  Unfortunately, instead of starting from scratch, the general public now faces the challenge of unlearning their current understanding of blockchain and Web3. Only then can they truly grasp the remarkable innovations and opportunities that this new technology has to offer.  Finding balance  With their dynamic blend of entertainment and investment, meme coins have left an indelible mark on the crypto space and have played a crucial role in propelling Web3 recognition to mainstream audiences.  However, we must maintain a sense of focus towards the value and substance that cryptocurrency and Web3 offers. If meme coins continue to suck up much of the attention, this could play into the hands of regulators who might be looking for reasons to impose strict controls, and leave rulemakers with preconceived notions that all crypto is nonsense.

In this article, we have carefully examined these two significant potential tokens, understanding their use cases, price predictions, and how beneficial they could be for investors. Joe (JOE) Price Prediction Trader Joe is an innovative DeFi platform looking to offer an automated yield farming strategy for Liquidity Providers, consequently eliminating the traditional strenuous position management system. Joe (JOE), the native token of the Trader Joe platform, is currently preparing to launch an exciting feature to augment its current value proposition, the Auto Pool. Auto Pool is set to provide the best user experience and capital efficiency for DeFi users, ultimately helping the protocol generate more liquidity. This is a largely untapped area in the DeFi market, and with Joe (JOE) pioneering this aspect, you can be sure its adoption would be massive. Joe’s (JOE) first offering, The General, will be launched soon, making the token’s future growth worth keeping an eye on. Uwerx (WERX): Championing a New Era for Freelancers Like Joe (JOE) is doing in the world of DeFi, Uwerx is also set to revolutionize the freelancing industry, serving as a threat to the progression of existing freelancing platforms. While “threat” may sound somewhat exaggerated, it is actually the reality, considering the multiple advantages Uwerx has over these existing platforms, especially the incredibly lower transaction commission. Unlike Fiverr, which charges 20%, and Upwork, which charges 10% per transaction, Uwerx will only deduct a flat fee of 1% as commission, allowing freelancers to enjoy their money while fostering a healthy client-freelancer relationship. Beyond their transaction fee, the Uwerx team has also unveiled the “Uwerx Vault,” a central hub where users can stake (store their token for as long as they want while getting rewarded for it). SolidProof and InterFi Network have audited the platform to confirm its credibility and have also been listed by CoinSniper and awaiting Uniswap listing on Tuesday, August 1, 2023. The team has also promised to renounce all contracts and reduce taxes to zero before launching the project on centralized exchanges. The Uwerx platform currently boasts 1,600+ subscribers on Telegram, 1,600+ Twitter followers, and 5,500 sign-ups on the platform. Uwerx (WERX) is Enjoying an Incredible Presale Run The WERX token is enjoying an unbelievable adoption rate, with the token’s stage 1 to stage 4 presales getting completed in record time. Although currently at stage 5 of the presale at $0.041 per token with a 15% bonus. Thanks to this high demand, the Uwerx team has modified WERX token allocations and will lock liquidity before all presales end on Monday, July 31, 2023. In a more recent update, the team has also disclosed their plans to send tokens to holders immediately after the end of the presale in a 6-week vesting period. This vesting period will follow a defined vesting schedule: 8% on week 1, 10% on week 2, 14% on week 3, 18% on week 4, 22% on week 5, and 28% on week 6. Similarly, after the presale ends, they also plan to host a Test Airdrop, as voted by the community.

BTC’s price dipped to as low as $29,593 during the afternoon hours, near its lowest point in a month. The largest cryptocurrency by market value has been see-sawing in a tight channel since June 21, bouncing from the $29,500 level multiple times to trade as high as $31,809.  Ether (ETH) buckled below $1,900 to change hands 1% lower than 24 hours ago.  Ripple’s XRP pared some of its impressive gains from previous days, dropping some 6% in the last 24 hours. The token’s price almost doubled to 93 cents a week ago, following a partial court victory against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). After the decline, it was still trading at around 79 cents.  LINK, the native token of the Chainlink ecosystem, defied the market slump and was the only crypto asset with sizable gains among the 40 largest tokens by market capitalization.  The token surged 15% through the day above $8 for the first time in nearly three months as some large investors – whales in crypto jargon – acquired $6 million of tokens. The price action came after Chainlink released this week an interoperability protocol that facilitates communication between blockchains and banks, tested by interbank communication system Swift.  The CoinDesk Market Index, which tracks the performance of a basket of digital assets, gained early in the day then retreated and was down 1.26% over the last 24 hours.  Crypto investors might have been concerned by a sell-off in tech stocks. The NASDAQ 100 index (NDQ) declined 2% during the day, as investors dumped shares of tech giants Tesla (TSLA) and Netflix (NFLX) after their underwhelming quarterly earnings reports, dropping some 9%.  Cryptocurrency prices have a history of correlating with risk assets such as the tech-heavy NDQ, although the relationship has wobbled this year.  “Seems like we are just having a risk-off day in general after a massive run for weeks, with investors taking profits and rebalancing,” Brett Sifling, director at investment firm Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, told CoinDesk in a call.",NEUTRAL,BTC | LINK | XRP,BTC | LINK | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/20/chainlinks-link-pops-15-xrp-loses-steam-as-bitcoin-revisits-296k-range-lows,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c94a305fe1af8f8388c2ca4c70add81b2a926523-1700x994.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Coinbase's main sources of revenue, including transaction fees, staking, and custodial fees, are all under threat due to increasing competition and the decentralization of the crypto market. The company's legal position is still in jeopardy, and even a legal victory can open the door for freeriding competitors to take market share. Coinbase doesn't seem to have a solid path to profitability. All signs point to revenues decreasing over time. Bitcoin ETF filings are likely immaterial too. I cover some potential turnaround scenarios for Coinbase. The crypto markets broadly celebrated the Ripple (XRP-USD) ruling last Thursday. Coinbase Global, Inc. ( COIN ) saw a 25% rally after the announcement. COIN has tripled since the start of the year and nearly doubled in the last month. The ruling stated that the XRP token was considered a security when sold directly to institutions but not when offered to the public on exchanges. This implies a possible constraint on the SEC's power to intensify its crackdown on crypto. The court's decision is seen as a challenge for the SEC's other lawsuits, especially the one filed in June against Coinbase for allegedly offering unregistered securities. With legal outcomes seemingly stacked against the SEC, Coinbase appears to be experiencing ample tailwinds from improving-sentiment. The recent rally in COIN is likely a combination of short covering and positive adjustments to financial models. As these forces run out of steam, the reality of Coinbase’s fundamentals will begin to play a larger role in COIN’s price. And the reality is rather bearish. The Business Model Coinbase has four main sources of revenue: transaction fees, interest, staking, and custodial fees. The first two are pretty much the same business model as a normal brokerage – commissions paid for trading and interest paid by cash sitting in accounts. Staking is a crypto specialty, where yield is generated by staking crypto on proof-of-stake blockchains to help secure the chain. Coinbase calls this “blockchain rewards.” Custodial fees are paid by firms who trust Coinbase to securely store their crypto in cold wallets. BlackRock’s high-profile Bitcoin ETF application lists Coinbase as the custodian . Coinbase states a few more revenue streams in their filings , but these are largely negligible. Revenues (10K) Revenues (10Q) In 2022, more than 2/3 of revenue came from transaction fees. In Q1 2023, about half came from transaction fees. Interest income seems to be expanding, but this is because interest rates have increased so much since 2021. If rates stay where they are, then we could expect interest income to hold. If rates fall, interest income will take a hit, but transaction fees might increase because falling rates could lead to more crypto trading volume. Operating in a Cutthroat Industry For a company to generate value to shareholders, it needs to have some kind of moat. Basic economics tells us that perfect competition causes economic profits to tend towards zero. The only way corporations today generate profits is with their moats – their ability to provide something others cannot easily provide. Currently, the only solid moat Coinbase has is its brand reputation. Superior versions of every single one of its services already exist and will continue to propagate. Given this reality, it’s not hard to see that Coinbase’s top line faces various existential threats. Coinbase's business model is increasingly vulnerable because crypto is close to perfectively competitive thanks to its decentralization. The lack of regulation (and often, the inability of regulators to even enforce regulations) lowers the hurdle to build products. Smart contracts with anonymous development teams can handle millions of dollars daily. One prominent example of this is GMX, a decentralized exchange on the Arbitrum and Avalanche chains with a completely anonymous team. The ubiquitous nature of the Internet makes it much easier for users to learn about and switch over to other platforms. Transaction Fees Should Decrease Coinbase’s trading fees should be lower. It isn’t particularly hard to build crypto exchanges with much lower fees, and cheaper decentralized exchanges are already starting to take market share from centralized exchanges. Regardless of what happens to crypto’s regulatory acceptance in the U.S., U.S. based investors can easily find cheaper alternatives to Coinbase. Fees (Coinbase) As the industry matures, these transaction fees should trend towards zero because of competition. Other centralized exchanges can offer a similar mechanism of custodied crypto and then have a backend which tracks who “owns” tokens during live trading and then displays the updates to the frontend. No on-chain transactions need ever be recorded, and if the user wishes to withdraw, the exchange can simply send some of the custodied crypto to a target address. The cost of these updates is almost zero, which means the fees cannot be much higher than zero. For reference, Binance’s spot trading fees are 20 bps and its derivatives fees are in the low single digits. If Coinbase were to make such a change, its transaction fee revenue would take a big cut. Custodian Fees Should Decrease, Even Though ETFs Could Be a Short-Term Boost The ability to custody crypto is another area where Coinbase faces headwinds. It is not difficult to custody cryptocurrencies. The proliferation of wallets and storage solutions, coupled with an increasingly tech-savvy customer base, will likely lead to decreased custodian fees in the long run. A cold wallet (one that is disconnected from the Internet) is also very easy to create and maintain. Technically, one can flip a coin over 250 times, record this sequence as the private key, and then use the private key to generate a public address to serve as the wallet. The private key doesn’t even have to be on a computer , let alone be disconnected from the Internet. It is very easy to secure crypto. Though BlackRock has listed Coinbase as the custodian for its Bitcoin ETF, BlackRock absolutely can do the whole thing in-house and keep the custodian fees for themselves. Coinbase’s customers can terminate at any time and incur no penalty when doing so. Custodial fees (10K) In the short term, Coinbase might see more revenues from custodial fees if crypto spot ETFs become mainstream. However, the very design of crypto ensures coins are extremely simple to secure, creating significant headwinds for custodial fees in the long term. This is not IAU or GLD with their large vaults of physical gold. Staking Income Will Probably Fall Too The commissions for staking are too high to be sustainable. It is trivial to stake ETH with just a 10% fee, let alone 20-30% of one’s staking yield. Staking service (Coinbase) Many big DeFi protocols also offer something called Liquid Staking Derivatives ((LSD)). Because staking crypto involves locking it up, one cannot then use the staked coins for trading or collateral. An LSD is basically an on-chain IOU for the coins that have been locked up. The IOUs can then be deposited into other DeFi protocols to earn more yield. Think of this process as allowing users to gain more capital efficiency. If used correctly, greater capital efficiency is obviously better for generating higher returns. Coinbase does not offer anything like this. Once coins are staked on Coinbase, they must be unstaked (which takes some time) to be used for trading. There is no secondary protocol that the IOUs can be deposited in. The capital becomes “stagnant.” Once again, Coinbase’s moat in this area is not a superior service, but simply its trusted brand name. Like custodial fees, staking services could see more revenue in the short term if crypto adoption in the U.S. increases significantly. However, the advantages of numerous alternatives will not be a secret to anyone who does any research at all. Legal Issues are a Can of Worms, Even with a Victory Coinbase has committed itself to a legal crusade in the name of obtaining fair U.S. crypto regulation. The company has stepped up to a legal battle against the SEC, a move that places considerable uncertainty on its future. Despite the Ripple win, it’s obvious the story isn’t over because the SEC can still appeal and the ruling itself doesn’t impact Coinbase’s situation as much as the headlines make it seem. While a win against the SEC could indeed lead to rallies in COIN’s price, it still doesn't negate the issue of diminishing trading fees, which will continue to erode revenues. Moreover, this legal battle presents the ultimate free-rider problem: should Coinbase prevail, other U.S. exchanges can quickly enter the market and leverage the regulatory groundwork laid by Coinbase without incurring the associated costs or risks. On the flip side, should Coinbase lose its legal battle, the stock is likely to suffer a significant price correction. While they could potentially pivot and move operations overseas, they would then have to face off against formidable global competitors such as Binance. Coinbase is in a precarious situation. Other Headwinds The very nature of crypto presents a unique challenge for Coinbase. The U.S. crypto market remains fairly niche, with a large proportion of potential customers who are highly motivated to bypass domestic regulatory obstacles. The use of VPNs to evade apps which geofence the U.S. is one such example. This implies a potential loss of domestic customer base too. Again, the core ethos of cryptocurrencies – decentralization – implies a market environment characterized by perfect competition. Under such conditions, Coinbase's competitive edge appears to be thinning. At present, it can perhaps rely on its strong brand name and trusted reputation for security. However, as the market becomes increasingly saturated and consumers become more knowledgeable and comfortable with the industry, the value of this “moat” should dwindle. How Coinbase Might Turn Things Around Throughout this article I have been saying that Coinbase’s brand name is its only moat right now. This is largely true, and it underscores the fact that Coinbase is an innovative company that has built what could be considered a good central aggregator to conveniently access many crypto ecosystems. Coinbase has been relentless in innovating, including announcing the development of Base , an Ethereum L2. The first thing COIN needs is a clear path to actual profitability. Its forward EPS is -$2.74. Its free cash flow per share in the last twelve months is -$4.87. Current revenue streams all face substantial long-term issues. Coinbase must find a way to pivot its business model away from exchange, staking, and custodial services, which all face a race to zero as crypto knowledge becomes more widespread. They are not profitable even with the current moat. Things will get much worse when this moat begins to disappear as competitors catch up. I see Base as the beginning of a pivot to embrace on-chain economic activity in Web3 and DeFi. Coinbase did a similar pivot years ago when they switched from being a Bitcoin-only service provider to an exchange for hundreds of tokens. This helped them ride the waves of altcoin booms in the last few years. The second thing COIN needs is some regulatory clarity. COIN is clearly trying to “do the right thing” by going through the U.S. legal process in good faith. Other service providers have been quick to simply abandon the U.S.A. market. The problem is this does not mean they are no longer Coinbase competitors! U.S. users can easily get on other exchanges with more favorable terms at very little cost to themselves. There’s no legal recourse for Americans who choose to use exchanges which are in obvious violation of U.S. laws. The sooner Coinbase gains regulatory clarity, the sooner it can stop spending money on legal battles and have a clear product suite, or maybe decide to move operations abroad. For now, they are trying to make everyone happy by dynamically changing their product suite . Of course, regulations aren’t really under Coinbase’s control. A third way for COIN to turn things around is through strategic partnerships and investing, although this is quite a long shot. Since there are so many startups in the Web3 space, an early-stage investment in something that becomes big could pay big dividends. Coinbase’s public backing is also an asset for the startups. Currently, Coinbase Ventures is a program which does exactly this. It has a diverse portfolio of investments in DeFi and Web3. Most of these investments will be worthless just by the nature of early stage investing. Absolutely a long shot. Valuation and Conclusion There is no need for complicated models here. COIN is headed to zero if it cannot be profitable. This is an economic fact. Right now, the path to profitability seems unlikely. I am also not certain the U.S. will be friendly towards crypto either. The reality is a lot of tokens are probably securities. Proof-of-stake also has many properties that are equity-like . I discuss this in an article analyzing the SEC’s lawsuits in June. Much of COIN’s valuation hinges on what transpires in the next few months in court. Furthermore, Coinbase is a speculative investment. If the Fed cuts rates or if the current risk-on trend we’ve seen this year persists, then the COIN rally could continue. In the long-term, lack of profitability will catch up. I like Coinbase as a company and believe in their mission of increasing economic freedom around the world. It is a bold and worthwhile objective. I admire Coinbase for holding its ground in the U.S. even though so many others have decided to go overseas. That said, there are noble intentions and there are good business practices, and the two are often unrelated to each other. I rate COIN a sell. However, I will continue to watch the company’s developments and publish updates to this investment thesis. Privately, I do hope for a turnaround in all their prospects.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4618550-coinbase-fundamentals-failing-business-model-no-profits-in-sight?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/15116885.jpeg

15116793,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=543615,1689885962,Did Justin Sun Use Fake Balance? Tron Founder’s $62 Million TUSD Minting Raises Eyebrows,"Crypto analyst Adam Cochran recently caused a stir in the cryptocurrency community when he called attention to a series of TrueUSD (TUSD) transactions made by Tron founder Justin Sun. Cochran highlighted a series of transactions made by Sun’s address on the Tron blockchain, including minting $62 million worth of TUSD, withdrawing $50 million in USDT from Huobi, and depositing $50 million in USDT on Bitfinex. Justin Sun’s Dubious TUSD Transactions Perhaps most concerning, however, was Sun’s apparent burning of $50 million TUSD, which Cochran suggested could be an attempt to temporarily “snapshot or unwind” debt using a “fake” balance that was “unbacked”. Cochran also pointed out that Sun appeared to be using Poloniex and Huobi as his own “piggy” banks to borrow against, with large amounts of Huobi assets being plowed into JustLend – an official lending platform on the TRON blockchain – for him to borrow against shitcoins. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Rejoice: Blofin Forecasts $49,000 Price High With Potential Spot ETF Launch These transactions have raised questions about Sun’s motivations and the potential impact of his actions on the broader cryptocurrency market. In particular, Cochran expressed concern that Sun’s apparent “manipulation” of TUSD could create the appearance of greater liquidity in the market and potentially lead to price manipulation. Compounding these concerns is that Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has reportedly offered voluntary termination packages to employees in multiple departments. This move has raised questions about the financial stability of Binance and its potential exposure to Sun’s actions. Cochran concluded: CZ offered multiple departments “voluntary termination” offers where any staff member could apply to resign today, sign a new NDA and get a 3 month severance to quit. Totally normal thing to do after already big cuts…. The Uncertainty Of Justin Sun’s Cryptocurrency Moves The potential risks of Justin Sun’s transactions are unclear, as his motivations for these actions are unknown. However, several possible concerns have been raised in the crypto community. One potential risk is the possibility of price manipulation. If Sun was attempting to manipulate the price of specific cryptocurrencies by creating the appearance of greater liquidity in the market, this could lead to price distortions that could harm investors and destabilize the market. Another risk is the possibility of a liquidity crisis. If Sun’s actions caused a sudden influx of TUSD or USDT into the market, this could lead to a sudden drop in the value of these cryptocurrencies, potentially causing a liquidity crisis and harming investors. There is also a risk that Sun’s actions could ripple throughout the broader cryptocurrency market, potentially causing other investors to panic or leading to a broader sell-off. Related Reading: SEC Allegedly Delays Assistance For US Crypto Market Bill Finally, there is a risk that Sun’s actions could trigger regulatory scrutiny or legal action, mainly if he is found to have engaged in illegal or unethical behavior. This could harm the reputation of the cryptocurrency industry as a whole and lead to increased regulatory oversight. Despite these concerns, it remains unclear precisely what Sun’s intentions were with the transactions highlighted by Cochran.

42410172,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcTy3P,1689883921,Tokenization News Roundup: Real-World Assets Come to Blockchains,"As crypto matures, ideas for marrying the power of the $20 trillion global financial services sector to the technological advantages of the blockchain are emerging. Momentum is building quickly behind the idea of tokenizing real-world assets, which is basically making a virtual investment vehicle on the blockchain derived from tangible, valuable things like homes, gold, art and collectibles, and even intangible instruments such as U.S. Treasuries and contracts.  Wall Street and crypto advocates alike argue that the process of tokenization is more efficient than, say, the manual mortgage application process. It creates liquidity and is cheaper, too, allowing for tokenization of smaller value items and theoretically should then be accessible for broader swaths of the world’s population.  Each week I’ll be rounding up the latest stories and reports from CoinDesk and the industry to keep you up to date on the progress of the tokenized real-world assets revolution.  Tokenize Everything: Institutions Bet That Crypto’s Future Lies in the Real World  Long one of crypto’s big ideas, tokenization may finally be ready for prime time. Wall Street is diving in, creating tokens for everything from buildings to gold bars. One advantage: relatively little regulatory scrutiny.  Takeaway: A great primer on what tokenization is, how it works and what its impact will be on the financial services world as we know it. CoinDesk contributor Jeff Wilser interviewed the CEOs of four startups that tokenize real-world assets, plus financial advisers and blockchain experts about the ideas and theories behind this burgeoning sector.  The impacts can be huge: “Maybe tokenizing stocks will just be a novelty. But if it’s truly cheaper and more efficient, and if it eventually scales to become the new normal, the impact could change Wall Street in ways it’s hard to imagine. Stocks could be traded 24/7, like cryptocurrency.”  But Wilser is not drinking the Kool-aid just yet: “The key word here, of course, is theoretically. Plenty of things sound transparent and risk-free in crypto – just ask the investors of Terra.”  If DeFi Wants to Grow, It Has to Embrace Real-World Assets  To scale, DeFi platforms need to attract institutions keen to trade tokenized bonds, equities, and debt, and physical assets such as gold, real estate and art, says Enrico Rubboli of Mintlayer.  Takeaway: An insider – a software developer turned CEO of a Bitcoin sidechain – makes the case for tokenization. In this opinion piece, Rubboli breaks down the well-known risks of decentralized finance and how the remedies have created problems such as over-collateralization, which dampens adoption.  Elements of traditional finance, such as the loans for real estate, cars and other valuable assets, are the solution. The way forward is a marriage of TradFi and DeFi: “DeFi protocols have already proven their worth in the digital asset markets and their efficiency is so compelling that traditional financial institutions are studying their potential.  While there is still some opposition to the idea of automated and decentralized asset trading, due to its association with a crypto market that’s often perceived to be lawless and volatile, there’s a growing consensus that traditional finance can no longer ignore the potential benefits blockchain can provide.  More Tokenized Treasuries Arrive on Polygon as Digital Bond Market Expands  Ondo’s OUSG token, one of the largest on-chain tokenized Treasury products, has accrued $134 million of assets under management on Ethereum.  Takeaway: A surge in tokenized U.S. Treasuries is the latest sign of adoption in the growing movement to tokenize real-world assets. DeFi investment platform Ondo, formed by ex-Goldman Sachs associates, launched just seven months ago but has already broadened its offerings to include issuing tokens on Polygon from its initial platform on Ethereum.  The move is another indicator for the thirst for this type of product: “Tokenized Treasuries has grown to a $600 million market, with Ondo Finance’s OUSG token claiming a significant share of $140 million since its inception in January. Flux Finance, developed by Ondo’s team and governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) through community votes, lets investors take out loans by pledging OUSG as collateral. It has $44 million of total value locked on the platform, according to DefiLlama.”  An Allocator’s Guide to Tokenized Treasuries  From $100B+ asset managers to young startups, tokenized US Treasuries are exploding in popularity. This 50+ page report dives into the details of what differentiates them.  Takeaway: A direct way to invest in this emerging space is to find a fund that gives you broad exposure to millions of dollars of tokenized assets. Data analytics firm RWA.xyz released a report analyzing the emergence of investment vehicles for tokenized Treasuries.  More than a dozen such products or similar products have launched – the bulk of them just in the last six months – from established asset managers such as Franklin Templeton, to new ones, such as Arca. The firm looked at 10 of them, divided by whether they are actively or passively managed, and analyzing risks, convenience, and potential yield.  Each assessment include commentary, such as: “Amongst all other products, [Franklin Templeton’s] BENJI stands at the top in terms of investor protection and transparency. ... In the future, we look forward to some interesting ways for Franklin to enable Peer-to-Peer transfer functionality of BENJI tokens.” The Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund launched in 2021 on the Stellar blockchain, and its availability was expanded to the Polygon blockchain in May 2023. It is a tokenized money market fund that invests in U.S. Treasuries.  MakerDAO Now Earns 80% Of Its Fee Revenue From Real-World Assets  MakerDAO now boasts a $2.34B RWA portfolio.  Takeaway: MakerDAO, a peer-to-peer lending platform on the Ethereum blockchain, is the third-largest DeFi protocol by total value locked. It now earns the vast majority of its fees from the tokenization of real-world assets, but it’s not without controversy. “Despite the revenue rolling into Maker’s coffers, RWAs have proved a contentious subject within the protocol’s community. Last August, MakerDAO’s founder, Rune Christensen, floated a 25% hard limit on the protocol’s real-world asset collateral including centralized stablecoins as part of its Endgame roadmap.”  CORRECTION (July 27, 2023, 20:11 UTC): The Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund launched before this year and rather than investing in tokenized Treasuries, it is itself a tokenized money market fund.

42410151,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcTyXA,1689880964,"Initial Jobless Claims Suggest Continued Fed Tightening, but Investors Appear Unfazed","Initial jobless claims fall for the second consecutive week. Labor markets remain strong  Second quarter wage growth currently outpacing inflation indicates that while progress has been made, more will be needed.  Crypto markets have remained stable amid mixed macroeconomic data.  Initial jobless claims in the United States for the week ending July 15, declined to 228,000, 9,000 lower than the prior week, and below expectations for 242,000. The second, consecutive weekly decline reflects a persistently strong labor market and  It also marks the mild reaction to significant macroeconomic events over the past 10 days.  BTC prices moved less than 2% after last week’s Consumer Price Index, Non-Farm Payrolls and Quarterly GDP growth.  The knee-jerk narrative for cryptocurrencies for today’s release is that tight labor markets prolong any chance that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will halt interest rate increases. This would likely limit crypto prices.  The real-time crypto market reaction suggests that crypto investors have already included this into their investment calculus. So while a lid appears to be on bitcoin prices, its appears to be a light one, applying minimal downward pressure  BTC prices fell 0.22% during the 8 AM ET hour, following the data release. Ether by comparison sank 0.25%. Both declines occurred on lower than average volume, illustrating the muted impact of what has become a recurring theme for U.S. labor markets.  The 4-week average of jobless claims declined for the third consecutive week. If the FOMC is looking for weaker job growth before pivoting to a lower interest rate environment, this news would not support such a move.  Further exacerbating tight labor markets is higher median earnings for wage and salaried workers. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, second quarter median earnings for full- time wage and salary workers was 5.7% higher than a year prior, compared to a current 4% increase in Consumer Prices.  While inflation has been steadily declining, labor markets and overall earnings’ strength would likely cause prices to rise, were the FOMC to forego a rate hike. Market expectations for a 25 basis point (bps) increase on July 26 are now 99.8%, up from 98% a day prior.  Crypto investors seem unfazed with bitcoin levels almost identical to where they stood 30 days ago. The same holds true for Ether, as both assets have been trading near their respective 20-day moving averages.  Momentum for both is neutral as well. Their respective Relative Strength Index (RSI) figures sit near 50, signaling neither bullish nor bearish sentiment.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/20/initial-jobless-claims-suggest-continued-fed-tightening-but-investors-appear-unfazed,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1e3fa3bfe561b1eb41ee6ed2246a19e8b326f64e-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This has been considered a potential hurdle if the bill is to pass in Congress. Through multiple sources, the Block found that the SEC has yet to provide sufficient technical assistance for the bill after almost six weeks of request. The report stated that this appears to be the case despite the supposed commission’s good communication with the House. SEC officials have recently provided briefings to the staff of Democratic members of the House Financial Services Committee. These briefings reportedly covered their opinions on digital asset regulation in light of the committee’s upcoming consideration of bills to establish a comprehensive framework for cryptocurrency markets in the United States. Related Reading: Arkansas Senator Calls For Reversal Of Controversial New Crypto Mining Law While the Securities and Exchange Commission seems to be dragging its feet in responding to the House’s request, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is said to have been receptive so far, providing the congressional staff with some technical assistance. Final Draft Of Crypto Market Bill To Be Unveiled Various House committees have been working together for months to create a new bill for crypto markets in the country. This crypto market bill, led primarily by Republican members, is expected to direct the U.S. market regulators on how a digital asset can transition from a security to a commodity. Additionally, it would temporarily confer the Commodity Futures Trading Commission superior power over crypto commodities markets – mainly Bitcoin trading. A final draft of this multi-committee bill will reportedly be introduced today, July 20, 2023. This is in anticipation of a committee debate and vote next week. Initially, a committee debate and amendment process for the Financial Services Committee part of the bill was scheduled on Wednesday, July 19. However, this “markup” has been rescheduled to the following week to allow enough time for additional review by committee members. Senators Urge SEC Chairman To Crack Down On Crypto Companies On Wednesday, July 19, two prominent figures in the U.S. Senate criticized the crypto industry, pressing the Securities and Exchange Commission to be more aggressive in its regulatory style. Democrat Senator Dick Durbin D-III condemned the activities of crypto companies in the United States. The government official said: They spent billions on sports arena or stadium naming rights deals to gain misguided credibility with everyday Americans and manipulate prices with phony tokens of no underlying value. Related Reading: Terraform Labs Appoints New CEO Following Do Kwon’s Sentencing In Montenegro Senator John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, asked Gensler why there was “no emergency injunction to force the bankrupt FTX exchange to halt its operations before collapsing last November.” The SEC chairman responded, saying: We investigate by the book. You, I’m sure, and the American public, want us to follow the facts, follow the law, properly get people subpoenas. Although Gensler agreed with the Senators’ claims about the crypto industry and the need for more policies, he made a case for the underlying technology. Meanwhile, he took the opportunity to request more funding for his agency.

Non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea announced Thursday it's rolling out “Deals,” a peer-to-peer NFT swap function to help traders bolster their collections and engage with other collectors directly.  OpenSea said in a tweet that Deals will allow collectors to trade NFTs among each other – as well as to include wrapped ether (WETH) to “sweeten the deal.” It added that the feature is powered by OpenSea’s native NFT protocol Seaport.  OpenSea added that the product aims to make the NFT swapping trustworthy, fending off “sketchy DMs and websites” that many collectors fall victim to when trading NFTs.  See Also: Pixel Penguins, an NFT Charity Scam, Shows Dangers Of NFT Influencer Culture  According to the Deals webpage, users can enter the username, ENS name or wallet address of the person they want to make a deal with. They then can select up to 30 NFTs, as well as the amount of WETH they want to add to the swap, if any.  Next, they select the assets they would like to offer to trade and then they can send the deal for consideration. Right now, OpenSea requires the NFTs on both sides of the deal to be on the same chain and from badged (verified) collections.  If the user accepts the Deal, they will pay any gas fees needed for the transfers, but as of now, Deals swaps will not have OpenSea fees or pay creator royalties.  A spokesperson from OpenSea told CoinDesk that Deals aims to invite more users to participate in NFT communities by simplifying the swapping process. By leveraging Seaport, collectors can swap NFTs on OpenSea without being subject to risks that might occur off-platform.  OpenSea has been in fierce competition with leading zero-fee marketplace Blur, who has challenged the platform’s market share since its launch in October. In May, Blur launched Blend, its native lending platform that nabbed 82% of overall NFT trading volume in its first three weeks.

The change in leadership comes as Kwon, also Terraform Labs' principal shareholder, is under the threat of possible extradition to South Korea or the U.S. from Montenegro. Steering Through the Storm The Wall Street Journal reported that Terraform Labs has named U.S. citizen Chris Amani as its new CEO. Amani, who has been with Terraform since 2021, previously served as its chief operating officer and chief financial officer. Prior to his tenure at Terra, Amani held the CEO position at Humanity, a scheduling solution provider. His LinkedIn profile reveals that he took the reins as Terra's CEO in April 2023. Despite the company's past focus on stablecoins, Amani stated that the firm will not launch any more of such offerings, instead concentrating on other products. ""We have a vision for how we could salvage this, even though I think it's going to be hard and it's going to take a long time,"" Amani said. He also expressed hope that Kwon would clear himself of all charges, while affirming that Terra will continue to operate in his absence. Legal Quagmire and Market Impact Terra's collapse in May 2022 set off a domino effect that rattled the crypto market. The platform's stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST), lost its peg to the U.S. dollar, inciting investigations into Kwon and co-founder Daniel Shin's suspected involvement in illicit transactions during the collapse. In March 2023, Kwon was arrested in Montenegro for allegedly using counterfeit travel documents. Although he received a four-month prison sentence, he also faces the prospect of extradition to either the U.S. or South Korea post-sentence. South Korean prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for Kwon in 2022, accusing him of violating the country's capital market laws. He was later released on bail.

15112540,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=543565,1689875948,"Bitcoin Bulls Rejoice: Blofin Forecasts $49,000 Price High With Potential Spot ETF Launch","Digital asset management platform Blofin has released a report that explores the changing narrative of the cryptocurrency market, focusing on the diverging correlation between Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). The report suggests that BTC is becoming an increasingly prominent macro underlying asset, approaching the status of traditional assets such as foreign exchange and precious metals, while ETH’s narrative is shifting towards mega stocks. BTC Gaining Prominence As Macro Underlying Asset According to the report, the attractiveness of ETH for liquidity may continue to be weaker than that of BTC, especially in the current era of “lack of liquidity,” unless there is a grander narrative and widespread application. Moreover, the report notes that a new Crypto 3.0 narrative has emerged, which combines macro trading, artificial intelligence (AI), and other factors. The report suggests that BTC’s macro attributes have been continuously strengthened by existing and external liquidity preferences, with the Bitcoin network becoming a natural macro underlying asset. Related Reading: Terraform Labs Appoints New CEO Following Do Kwon’s Sentencing In Montenegro The report also highlights the importance of BTC being a fully compliant asset, unlike ETH, which has not been recognized as a security by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This ambiguity around ETH’s status implies risk, while BTC has been identified as a commodity. Institutions are less likely to take risks on compliance, making BTC the preferred choice for many investors. Last but not least, the report also considers three scenarios for the future price of BTC, depending on changes in interest rates and market expectations. The most optimistic scenario involves a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) passing and pushing BTC’s market share up to 60%, resulting in a market cap of $960b and a unit price of over $49,400. However, if investors have no better expectations and the crypto market capitalization is limited, the market capitalization of BTC will fluctuate between $600-$700b, and the price will fluctuate between $30,880-$36,026. Caution Until Bitcoin Can Sustain Above $32,000 Capriole Invest, a leading provider of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investment strategies, has released its latest Bitcoin Macro Index report. The report provides a comprehensive and data-driven analysis of the current state of the cryptocurrency market, combining over 40 powerful on-chain, macro market, and equity indicators into a single machine-learning model. The report reveals that Bitcoin is facing significant resistance at the $32,000 mark, despite a series of positive news stories for the industry in recent weeks. While the Blackrock ETF announcement, XRP legal victory, and backing from presidential candidate Kennedy for backing the US Dollar with Bitcoin have all made headlines, they have not been able to sustain momentum above $31,000. Related Reading: Arkansas Senator Calls For Reversal Of Controversial New Crypto Mining Law According to the report, until Bitcoin can convincingly sustain price levels above $32,000, it is prudent to be conservative in the upper $30,000 region. On the high timeframe technicals, Bitcoin has failed to break out of weekly resistance at $32,000, suggesting a greater area of opportunity on a $32,000 break or reversion to the mid-$20,000s. The report concludes that while opportunities for trades may exist if the range lows can hold on to the lower time-frames at the end of the day, the risk-reward opportunity is not present for high-conviction investments. Despite a 50% increase in Bitcoin’s mining network in the last six months, long-term value remains, but now is probably not the time to go all-in. At present, Bitcoin is facing a challenge to maintain its position above the crucial $30,000 line, which is a fundamental psychological level for investors with a positive outlook for the cryptocurrency. The leading digital asset in the market is currently trading at $29,750, indicating a 0.8% decline in the past 24 hours.

42410141,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcTxqB,1689875312,"Why Nasdaq Backing Out of Custody Is Bad, Bad News for Crypto","Yesterday, Nasdaq, the prominent, tech-forward U.S. stock exchange, announced it is calling off plans to launch a cryptocurrency custody service. The new business line, which would have been regulated as a special purpose trust in New York, was slated to launch in the second quarter of this year.  The news is a significant blow amid emerging signs of life in the crypto industry. Last month, an unexpected proposal from world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) rekindled optimism for an asset class that was pummeled by regulators and bad news for at least the past 16 months.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  BlackRock signaled that, despite the recent, apparently-coordinated crypto clampdown by U.S. authorities (sometimes called “Choke Point 2.0”), there is still deep institutional interest in bitcoin and crypto. A flurry of other spot bitcoin ETF filings quickly followed, and the white-collar side of crypto scored a win after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) missed its window to deny a different but similarly exciting type of bitcoin ETF to start trading. Markets sprang back.  On top of all that, a major concession to Ripple last week in a long simmering legal dispute with the SEC masked the Silicon Valley blockchain pioneer’s expensive technical defeat – after a district judge found that over $700 million of Ripple’s sales of XRP direct to hedge funds constituted illicit securities offerings – also buoyed sentiment. XRP short sellers were liquidated as a number of U.S. and international crypto exchanges announced plans to restart XRP trading, reversing a wave of delistings from 2020.  Nasdaq’s decision to exit the crypto custody business before it fully entered is likely not enough to derail the increasingly positive sentiment in crypto. But it is nonetheless a blow, and one that portends that much of the industry might be on its way to nowhere if the current regulatory regime stays in place.  In a quarterly earnings call, Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman said the firm pulled out because of “the shifting business and regulatory environment in the United States,” a line that crypto has heard often over the past year. The company initially announced its custody plans in September alongside the formation of a new unit Nasdaq Digital Assets, to which the firm remains committed. Friedman added the firm still plans to “build and deliver” crypto software, including other custody solutions, and list BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF if that is approved.  It’s still unclear why exactly Nasdaq is backing out – whether there’s proximate cause or if this is just an example of a corporation reading the tea leaves. (CoinDesk has reached out for more comment.) The firm was reportedly in dialogue with the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) for months, and it’s unknown if its proposed limited trust-purpose trust company got the official greenlight.  Notably, in February, the SEC voted to expand its existing regulations over all trading and lending firms by requiring them to keep customer assets with “qualified custodians,” meaning chartered bank or trust companies, SEC-registered broker-dealers or Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) derivatives merchants. Crypto speaks about the proposal as the “custody rule.”  The rule, which needs approval to go in effect, implicates more asset classes than just crypto, but seems designed to curtail full-stack crypto companies like Coinbase that offer both trading and custody services. Coinbase is famously (or infamously) not registered with the SEC (aside from having its IPO approved by the same regulator), and it disapproves of the proposed requirements to become “qualified” as a custodian.  See also: Matt Kolesky – Where the SEC’s Proposed Custody Rule Comes Up Short for Crypto | Opinion  In traditional finance, legalized gambling on securities is typically split into three distinct services – there are exchanges that handle trading, custodians that safekeep the assets being exchanged and clearinghouses that make sure trades settle (a side of the business that is handled automatically by the blockchain in the case of crypto assets). It’s worth mentioning a number of financial incumbents like JPMorgan and the Small Business Association also came out hard against the SEC’s “sweeping changes,” even though they might stand to benefit if crypto companies had to go outside the crypto industry to find approved custodians.  You might think a firm like Nasdaq would be fit to navigate the red tape, which is why its decision to back out of crypto custody is so telling. If they cannot do it, who can? Although the SEC’s stricter custody requirements are not yet in play, it seems increasingly likely that there will be regulation that separates custody services from trading. CoinDesk’s own Marc Hochstein supports the idea, and a number of bipartisan bills going through the U.S. Congress suggest the same.  In some form or another, crypto custody is going to come under greater scrutiny – a situation that would likely impact any business that does not offer non-custodial crypto services. And good. Such changes would have prevented Sam Bankman-Fried from allegedly dipping into FTX customer accounts had they been in effect (assuming for the hypothetical the overseas exchange was subject to U.S. law). Such rules would likely, at least in the near to mid term, benefit established financial companies and crypto incumbent BitGo (which dominates crypto custody) most. But even that might be preferable to the current situation, considering how many crypto-native custody firms keep dropping the bag.  But the fact that Nasdaq can’t quite hack the laws or grok what’s down the pike (or was even spooked by the XRP decision) does not bode well. Crypto custody is a cornerstone of the industry. Even if you can hold your own keys, there has to be workable solutions for everyone else.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/07/20/why-nasdaq-backing-out-of-custody-is-bad-bad-news-for-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1cf3fff43e18c1a82941ff37a497f2ee8f36d660-640x360.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410145,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcTyA1,1689874774,Setting Boundaries: Defining Active and Passive Management for Crypto,"Advisors should be provided with clearer definitions of active and passive management for digital assets to make more informed portfolio choices for their clients.  Since the creation of index funds, allocating between active and passive management remains the subject of great debate among investors. Over time, the boundary lines between active and passive investment vehicles for traditional asset classes have become better defined, benefiting from decades of analysis and product development. Unfortunately, the same cannot yet be said for crypto investment products.  Advisors investing in established asset classes today are tasked less with disentangling “active” vs. “passive” and more with determining how much active risk to take on for clients, and choosing the most sensible ways to do so from an accessible, well-populated landscape of highly competitive investment vehicles.  For advisors interested in digital assets, the task is doubly challenging because “active” and “passive” investment options are still only nascently defined and starkly lacking in both sophistication and ease of access.  Looking Through an Active/Passive Lens for Crypto  What does “active management” look like for crypto today? The following framework lays out the crypto investment landscape currently available for advisors, divided into three categories with pros and cons for each as well as their active or passive nature.  1. Single Token Buy-and-Hold  Often implemented directly via exchanges, through separately managed account platforms (SMAs), or investment trusts (especially in the absence of SEC-approved spot ETFs), buy-and-hold is the most simplistic way to add digital assets to an overall portfolio.  Pros:  Direct access to crypto  Low portfolio management overhead  Potentially more accessible via advisors’ existing wealth technology platforms  Cons:  Lack of diversification  Clients can independently obtain exposure  Potentially outsized management fees for naïve exposure  Certain vehicles may introduce unintended risks  Active vs. Passive:This represents passive exposure to a subset of digital assets (commonly BTC and ETH), but without the diversification and risk-management benefits of typical rules-based passive indices.  2. Automated Indices  Automated indices provide a rules-based framework for crypto exposure to a broader number of assets (often the top 10-25 assets by market cap) and systematically rebalance to meet portfolio construction goals. Currently, U.S. investors often access these products through multi-asset SMAs.  Pros:  Improved diversification and outperformance potential vs. single-token exposures  Rules-based portfolio construction creates consistent exposure to the broader crypto market  Cons:  Current options often lack nuanced thematic or sector-specific allocations or personalized customization  Typically higher-touch onboarding process vs. individual buy-and-hold  Potential underperformance vs. actively managed products  Active vs. Passive:While some tout the automated nature (i.e., rebalancing) of these products as “active,” these should be considered purely passive exposures akin to index funds for traditional asset classes.  3. Quantitative or Discretionary Management  Active managers construct strategies that leverage discretionary blockchain expertise and quantitative on-chain analysis to provide sophisticated crypto exposures. These are often accessed via hedge funds or specialized SMAs.

In 2016, by comparison, it was acquired by Digital Currency Group for $500K. Crypto conglomerate DCG, as it's known, is suffering from the bankruptcy of its Genesis Global Capital lending arm following an industry-wide downturn and falling token prices. At the height of the post-pandemic crypto-market boom, DCG was said to be valued at $10B . As part of the CoinDesk deal, which is expected to be finalized in the next few weeks, DCG is expected to keep a stake in the crypto news site, people familiar with the matter told the Wall Street Journal, without quantifying the size.

The investor group that's in the final stages of sealing the CoinDesk takeover is led by Matthew Roszak of Tally Capital, a crypto-focused investment firm, and Peter Vessenes of Capital6, a family office and venture capital firm, according to the people, the WSJ reported.

This development aims to disrupt the military-controlled financial system and fund efforts to regain civilian rule. Neobank Initiative The NUG's neobank, known as the Spring Development Bank (SDB), plans to offer currency swap, fixed deposits, and prize-linked savings account services via a web-based app, according to a spokesperson's statement at a recent virtual press conference. The bank aims to primarily cater to supporters of the ousted leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, including the Burmese diaspora. By using Uniswap v3 pools and USDT stablecoins, SDB will enable users to bypass the conventional financial infrastructure controlled by the State Administration Council (SAC), the military government. Donations made through SDB will directly contribute to the revolution effort and help with the reconstruction of post-revolution Myanmar. Raising Funds for Revolution Since the military coup in February 2021, which triggered various sanctions from governing bodies like the U.S. and the EU, the NUG has been devising innovative methods to raise funds to challenge the military junta. These initiatives include issuing revolutionary bonds and auctioning off properties held by military leaders. The bank, solely owned by NUG’s Ministry of Planning, Finance, and Investment, intends to offer shares to the public in two phases. An initial coin offering (ICO) round will exclusively serve SDB account holders, followed by another ICO round targeting institutional investors. The bank also plans to raise funds through remittances, currency exchanges, loans, and other financial products. In 2021, the NUG assigned Tether as its official currency. The revolutionary government has since been recognized as the official government of Myanmar by members of the United Nations and the European Parliament, from October 2021 forward. It has been clear, however, that the U.S. has never officially disclosed any recognition of this matter.

SDB aims to onboard 100,000 active users within six months.

In a governance vote that concluded Thursday at 12 p.m. (ET), voters unanimously favored stopping additional lending to the embattled credit pool, managed by fintech firm Harbor Trade. Maker is led by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), where those who hold MKR tokens can participate in governance decisions.  “While Harbor Trade has verbally committed to cease additional draws and voluntarily wind down the vault, community members have expressed concern about the existing 7 million debt ceiling and the risk of potentially increasing exposure to this vault,” a MakerDAO governance post said.  Maker’s $4.6 billion stablecoin DAI is backed by debt positions overcollateralized by cryptocurrencies, and increasingly, tokenized versions of loans and bonds, to earn a yield.  The Harbor Trade credit pool minted some $1.5 million of DAI stablecoins from MakerDAO and secured them with loans made to a consumer electronics firm. The borrower firm failed to pay down $2.1 million of debt matured in April.

Krishnan criticized the state of modern social media, calling it “stuck in a different era,” and urging that it was time for a change. He proposed the construction of ""large-scale crypto consumer social media marketplace applications"" as the way forward. The a16z partner highlighted key flaws in current social media platforms: a restrictive follower system, limited application programming interface support, meager economic benefits for creators, and a lack of user and creator input in platform governance. In contrast, Krishnan painted an optimistic picture of the potential that Web3 social platforms could offer, emphasizing the opportunities they present to underserved communities and high-status individuals whose voices are muted on other platforms. Social Platforms From Web3 Krishnan also proposed an unconventional approach to developing these platforms: eschewing financial incentives at the outset. Instead of initially focusing on monetary rewards for creators, Krishnan suggested centering the early stages of a platform's life on fostering community and engagement. “Social media dynamics are weird and complicated. These are complex human dynamics, and when you introduce money, I think it gets challenging to kind of map those dynamics,"" Krishnan claimed. According to the exec, prioritizing the monetary aspect can detract from the aim of community building and enjoyment. Handling Contradictions This doesn't mean the introduction of financial mechanisms should be completely foregone. According to Krishnan, once the platform has established its user base and community, creator economics and governance stakes can then be introduced. This incremental approach, he argues, could foster a more balanced and sustainable social media landscape. On the outset, Krishnan's views hold a promising potential not only for the reinvention of social media platforms but for the broader realization of Web3's inherent capabilities. Web3 technology, built on decentralized blockchain systems, offers a level of transparency and user control not feasible within the limitations of previous Web2 environments. These traits could lend themselves well to creating a social media ecosystem more responsive to user needs and desires. In this sense, then, the potential economic benefits offered by Web3 platforms could foster a more equitable digital environment. This is particularly significant for creators, who currently receive a minimal share of the revenue generated by their content on traditional platforms. Web3 has the potential to rectify this imbalance, offering creators a larger piece of the economic pie. The caution(s) proposed by Krishnan, to delay the introduction of financial incentives, could help ensure that these economic benefits do not overshadow the vital elements of community and engagement. Despite such a potential, Krishnan's vision of the future of social media is by no means assured, though it does provide a compelling blueprint for what could be possible. By harnessing the power of Web3, the next generation of social media platforms might not only resolve the issues inherent in existing platforms, but also open up new avenues for user engagement and creator remuneration.

42410149,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcTyJw,1689868800,UK's FCA Is Designing Prudential Requirements for Firms Carrying Out Crypto Activities,"The U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is designing prudential requirements for firms carrying out crypto activities.  The regulator, in charge of maintaining a registry of crypto firms approved for operations under the country's anti-money laundering requirements, will also consult on prudential rules for companies engaged in crypto activities once the ""Treasury and Parliament bring those activities under our regulation,"" according to an annual report published Thursday.  The government, earlier this year, consulted on its plans for regulating the crypto sector, which included a proposal to set up prudential requirements for crypto intermediation services.  The FCA could set ""minimum capital, liquidity and other relevant prudential requirements addressing both the potential for harm from on-going operations and the ability to wind-down in an orderly manner,"" for crypto companies, the consultation document said.  The regulator already has a prudential regime for investment firms like fund managers, asset managers and trading firms that are based in the U.K. The regime requires firms to assess capital adequacy and risk to identify potential harm to investors and provide appropriate resources to mitigate harm.  Last year, the FCA put out a notice for firms with exposure to crypto companies, urging them to ""have appropriate systems and controls to counter the risk of being misused for financial crime,"" and review if the firms they work with are registered crypto companies.  The crypto consultation proposes bringing crypto regulated activities under the regulated activities order which means the FCA will have the powers to write and amend their current rules for people carrying out crypto activities. The FCA will consider how to apply its existing rules focused on consumer protection, custody, operational resilience and conduct among other things, someone familiar with the matter said.  The FCA, which was approved for a host of new powers under a recently passed financial markets bill, stands to be the U.K.'s key crypto watchdog as the country explores its ambition to be a global hub for the sector.

Terraform Labs Elevates Former COO Chris Amani as Director and Interim CEO Chris Amani, an experienced leader with over two decades of experience in the technology industry, has been selected as the interim CEO for Terraform Labs. Having served as the Chief Operating Officer (COO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) since joining the company in 2021, Amani brings valuable insights and expertise to this new role. Related Reading: Binance Burns $480 Million In BNB, Will Price Recover? Previously, Amani held leadership positions at prominent technology companies such as MongoDB, Electronic Arts, and Zynga. His deep understanding of TFL’s operations and strategy positions him to steer the company through its current challenges and drive its mission forward. This decision comes as Kwon faces potential extradition to South Korea or the United States from Montenegro, where he is currently serving a prison sentence. Navigating Through Troubled Waters: Terra’s Comeback Plan Terra, known for its TerraUSD and Luna cryptocurrencies, faced a significant setback in May 2022 when the collapse of its stablecoin caused a ripple effect across the crypto market. Co-founder Do Kwon’s legal troubles further exacerbated the situation, with charges of misleading investors and alleged involvement in illicit transactions during the collapse. Amidst these challenges, Chris Amani expressed his commitment to reviving the Terra blockchain and focusing on developing applications that provide real utility. LUNA price sitting at $0.65 | Source: LUNAUSDT on Tradingview.com TFL’s comeback plan involves executing a clear vision for Terra’s role within the broader Web3 ecosystem, which Amani and the team are dedicated to implementing. The new CEO emphasized the importance of community collaboration and shared goals during this rebuilding phase. With approximately 40 employees, the company will continue to operate without Do Kwon’s leadership, as he focuses on addressing his legal affairs. The team is optimistic about its ability to salvage the situation and is actively working on plans to propel the company forward. Nevertheless, the legal issues surrounding Do Kwon’s involvement in the collapse have been a significant point of concern. Related Reading: Ethereum Monthly Burn Surpasses 146,000 ETH As Total Clears $6.5 Billion Terra’s recovery plan is not without its complexities, but the team is determined to restore value to the Terra Classic ecosystem.

We look forward to sharing more on this soon” The plan involves reducing node syncing times, creating a TerraUSD testnet, developing yield-generating applications, and implementing a reward system for developers.

The email, which has been reviewed and verified by CoinDesk, was sent by support@ftx.com - the official email address before the exchange collapsed in November.  The password reset link routes to the FTX claims portal that allows users to submit bankruptcy claims for assets they held on the platform before its demise.  Mossab Hussein, co-founder of cybersecurity firm Spidersilk, said the surprising emails can be attributed to one of two options: ""It's either FTX itself sending those emails [to notify them of the claims portal] and giving people a scare. Or, someone has ""a list"" of emails and is bruteforce resetting their credentials via the portal.""  If a hacker gained access to user's personal email addresses, they could feasibly gain access to a claimant's account and divert funds to their personal wallet.

42410140,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcTxtU,1689863805,"Fed Dramatically Speeds Up U.S. Payments With FedNow, but Downplays Any Tie to CBDCs","FedNow conveys money almost instantly, versus the hours or days it has conventionally taken in the U.S. – finally bringing the world's largest economy in line with other countries.  The central bank has denied that FedNow is tied to any digital U.S. dollar initiative.  The U.S. Federal Reserve officially opened its new instant payments service, FedNow, on Thursday, significantly speeding up how long it takes to send money in the world's largest economy.  The central bank said 35 banks and credit unions are participating. Early adopters include JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, with 16 other institutions supporting processing of payments that the Fed argues will offer just-in-time access to paychecks and invoices.  That is a dramatic change from the previous status quo, when payments sent through the U.S. banking system can take hours or days to get from one entity to another. Other countries have already shifted to instant payments.  ""The Federal Reserve built the FedNow Service to help make everyday payments over the coming years faster and more convenient,"" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a statement.  FedNow offers functionality that proponents of cryptocurrencies and blockchains have long championed: making it easier to move money around. The service could, therefore, increase friction between the conventional financial system and crypto – at a time when U.S. regulators have taken aggressive steps to clamp down on digital currencies.  FedNow has faced some criticism over potentially building a bridge to a future digital version of the U.S. dollar. However, in a July 10 FAQ, the Fed denied FedNow is tied to putative plans for such a thing.  Not a digital currency  “The FedNow Service is not related to a digital currency,” the Fed said, with officials such as the Treasury's Janet Yellen arguing the U.S. should consider a central bank digital currency (CBDC). “The FedNow Service is neither a form of currency nor a step toward eliminating any form of payment, including cash.”  The Fed says its new service will operate 24 hours a day. While continuing to use commercial banks as intermediaries, central bank officials have previously said it will allow payments to be processed in a matter of seconds, something that’s already the norm in many other jurisdictions across the world. That compares to a same-day service from the existing U.S. automated clearinghouse system, or delays of days or weeks for cashing a check.  Officials including Powell have previously said the real-time payment network is needed to avoid having to depend on private sector alternatives, like the now abandoned stablecoin Diem (previously named Libra) by Mark Zuckerberg's Meta (previously Facebook) while some have seen it as a step towards a central bank digital currency.

15106649,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=543492,1689861613,Arkansas Senator Calls For Reversal Of Controversial New Crypto Mining Law,"In April 2023, Arkansas made history by becoming the first state to pass the ‘Right to Mine’ Bitcoin bill in both the House and Senate. However, the “Right to Mine” law in Arkansas is encountering increasing opposition as it relaxes regulations on commercial crypto mining. Reports have suggested that loosening restrictions on commercial cryptocurrency mining has raised concerns. This is because after enacting the new law, large electricity-intensive crypto mines entered Arkansas. The legislation has sparked controversy by limiting the authority of city governments to regulate crypto mines. This has effectively stripped them of their ability to enforce local ordinances concerning such operations. During the 2023 legislative session, Arkansas Senator Bryan King (R) from District 28 expressed criticism of the bill’s introduction. And Senator King is reportedly planning to introduce another bill aimed at repealing the controversial “Right to Mine” law. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Continues To Shine With Over 20% Surge – What’s Next? Reports indicate that residents have raised numerous concerns, including excessive noise, substantial power grid usage, and the fact that Green Digital LLC., the company behind the proposed crypto mines in their cities, is a subsidiary partially owned by the Chinese Communist Party. Some Towns Have Rejected Proposed Crypto-Mining Facilities Arkansas Senator Bryan King has taken proactive steps by drafting a bill aimed at repealing the controversial law related to crypto-mining. One of the major worries is the strain on the local power grid caused by the electricity-intensive nature of crypto-mining operations. Reports have surfaced that some areas are already facing warnings of potential brownouts or blackouts. This is because of the increased energy consumption from these facilities. As of the current moment, local reports indicate that Arkansas is home to approximately 10 crypto mines. Vilonia and Harrison, two towns in Arkansas, have prevented attempts to establish proposed crypto-mining facilities within their respective city limits. Related Reading: Stellar Makes Surprise 70% Rally – Start Of Something Big For XLM? Senator Bryan King has further contended that crypto mines do not serve as economic boons to the communities where they establish their operations. He specifically highlighted that facilities like those proposed by Green Digital only employ a limited number of people. As such, the mines fail to provide substantial job opportunities or significant economic growth to the areas they operate. Advocacy For The Mining Bill Senator Joshua Bryant (R) who sponsored the bill explained and supported that the bill aims to protect property rights and stop the unfair treatment of crypto entrepreneurs. He said that crypto miners are people living in Arkansas who invest money in the state’s infrastructure, help keep utility costs stable, and boost the local economy. Bryant points out that if crypto-mining facilities are treated similarly to other data centers, the law allows local governments to create their own regulations. Furthermore, he clarified, that regarding noise ordinances, local governments are free to regulate commercial facilities as they deem appropriate. Related Reading: XRP Maintains Bullish Run With Nearly 80% Rally – Is $1 Within Reach? However, the bill specifically focuses on home mining operations. In this regard, it suggests adhering to existing federal and state laws related to nuisances. It also includes the US EPA Noise Act or standard statutory language outlined in the Disturbance Act. Nevertheless, the Arkansas “Right to Mine” law is set to take effect next month.

Senators Against DeFi U.S. Senators are taking a strong stance against money laundering and crypto-facilitated crime by introducing new legislation aimed at regulating decentralized finance (DeFi) services. The Crypto-Asset National Security Enhancement and Enforcement (CANSEE) Act requires DeFi platforms to comply with the same anti-money laundering (AML) and economic sanctions obligations as traditional financial companies. The bipartisan team of senators behind the CANSEE Act includes Jack Reed (D-RI), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Mark Warner (D-VA), and Mitt Romney (R-UT). DeFi To Get More Centralized The CANSEE Act will introduce tighter regulations and laws to DeFi, on par with the governance experienced by centralized institutions like banks, securities brokers, casinos, and centralized crypto trading platforms. Consequently, DeFi services will have to establish AML programs, conduct due diligence on customers, and report suspicious transactions to the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). Senator Warner noted, “I believe these focused measures will help maintain the robust AML and sanctions enforcement we need to protect our national security, while allowing participants who play by the rules to continue to take advantage of the potential of distributed ledger technologies.” The legislation will also extend to all individuals and entities who facilitate the use of DeFi platforms by sanctioned individuals. The regulations under the act also will hold accountable any investor putting in more than $25 million in a DeFi project without a clear in charge. Crypto ATMs In Trouble The CANSEE Act is also extended its reach over crypto ATMs, claiming their higher propensity to be used in money laundering activities. As a result of the legislation, operators of crypto ATMs across the country will need to conduct identity checks for all participants involved in any single transaction. Senator Reed stated, “Our bill will also ensure that law enforcement has access to better information about cryptocurrency transactions, which they need to fight crimes like cross-border drug trafficking, weapons proliferation, and ransomware attacks.” Industry Criticizes DeFi Bill The bill has been highly condemned by crypto Twitter, with experts deeming it an ""existential threat to DeFi.” There have also been questions about the bill’s imposition of control responsibilities, claiming it would discourage VCs from DeFi investments. The Crypto Council for Innovation stated that the proposal lacks specific guidance on how decentralized protocols can comply with Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) reporting requirements. They advocate for an alternative approach that involves distinguishing elements within the DeFi technology stack and using blockchain transparency and programmability to establish compliance measures tailored to the crypto ecosystem.

15105086,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=543461,1689858012,Bitcoin Near Crucial Retest: Which Of These Historical Patterns Will Repeat?,"On-chain data shows a Bitcoin indicator is near a crucial retest currently that may decide where the cryptocurrency will go next from here. Which Pattern Will Bitcoin Follow Next: 2016 Or 2019? As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC SOPR for short-term holders is approaching the baseline. The “Spent Output Profit Ratio” (SOPR) is an indicator that tells us whether Bitcoin investors are selling/moving their coins at a profit or at a loss right now. When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means that the average holder in the market is realizing some amount of profit with their selling currently. On the other hand, values below this threshold suggest loss taking is the dominant force in the market at the moment. Naturally, the SOPR being exactly equal to the 1 baseline implies the total amount of profits being realized are exactly canceling out the amount of losses as the market as a whole is neutral. This SOPR is for the entire Bitcoin market, but in the context of the current discussion, the relevant version of the metric is the one for just a single segment of the market: the “short-term holders” (STHs). The STH group includes all the investors who purchased their coins less than 155 days ago. This cohort generally includes the weak hands of the market, who may easily react to fluctuations in the market. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 90-day and 365-day moving averages (MAs) of the Bitcoin STH SOPR over the last few years: Looks like both the metrics have been above the baseline in recent days: Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the 90-day MA of the Bitcoin STH SOPR (colored in yellow) broke out above the 1 baseline back when this rally first started around the beginning of the year. This breakout suggested a shift towards profit selling for these investors, something that has historically been observed in all previous major rallies in the cryptocurrency. With the latest leg in the Bitcoin rally above the $30,000 mark, the 365-day MA of the indicator (highlighted in blue) has also managed to climb up above this mark. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Inflow Spikes, Is This Bearish? While this has been happening, though, the 90-day MA has actually been heading down and is now about to cross below the 365-day MA as it approaches the 1 baseline. In the chart, the quant has marked the two previous instances where a trend similar to this had formed for the asset. It looks like back in 2016 when the 90-day MA had retested the 1 mark after a similar structure had taken shape, the metric had found support at the break-even mark. This rebound kept Bitcoin going and the coin eventually built up into a bull market. In 2019, though, the retest of the 90-day MA STH SOPR failed and a bearish trend once again took over the coin. It wouldn’t be until 160 days later that bullish sentiment returned and the rally happened. Related Reading: Bitcoin Has Broken This Open Interest Pattern, Quant Explains As the current Bitcoin market looks to be in a similar spot as these two historical occurrences, it’s possible that it may follow the lead of one of these.

42410156,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcTykO,1689857100,Macro State of Crypto – Where It Has Been and What's Next,"Last week a U.S. Judge ruled that XRP is not a security, and the SEC accepted the BlackRock bitcoin ETF application, moving it to the next stage of the approval process. Within minutes of this XRP news, the token jumped from $0.45 to $0.61, pushing the price up over 25%. While these decisions and the many more coming led to even more regulatory questions, it is clear that rule changes are a significant factor in digital asset volatility.  As an advisor on digital assets, you must consider how current regulatory events and recent failures affect pricing and trade volume for bitcoin, ether and alt-coins.  Below, Greg Magadini, from Amberdata, takes us through crypto and regulatory events and provides some analytics on how these events impact prices and movement.  Also, can we include crypto in retirement funds? Thanks to Bryan Courchese from Daim for answering this week’s questions on the topic.  – S.M.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  Macro state of crypto – where it has been and what's next  In 2022, Terra Luna’s collapse, the crypto hedge fund 3AC’s bankruptcy, FTX’s scandal and other meltdowns pushed the industry into a bear market. These headlines drove the entire sector lower, often led by altcoins.  However, the first half of 2023 flipped a lot of these crypto relationships on their head as macro economic events splashed news headlines.  Bitcoin led crypto higher in January as the Fed’s hawkish narrative began to soften. This move was accompanied by a positive “spot/vol” regime, with traders buying options as Bitcoin rallied – a relationship not witnessed in 2022 when only price crashes seemed to drive volatility higher.  The takeaway was that bitcoin was trading on fundamental macro news, as opposed to crypto specific events.  If Ethereum is a crypto “technology bet,” bitcoin is a monetary alternative “pure-play.”  YTD performance of BTC (orange) and ETH (blue)  This narrative juxtaposition became obvious in March as the SVB banking crisis took hold.  Comparing the YTD performance of BTC and ETH spot prices, we can clearly see that BTC began an outperformance of ETH in reaction to the banking crisis and the Fed’s emergency response.  BTC has been able to hold onto this outperformance ever since.  YTD Ratio of implied volatility (ETH DVol divided by BTC DVol)  To see further evidence of a shift in these trading dynamics (a move towards macro events and a shift away from crypto specific news) we can observe the forward-looking option market activity.  The ratio of Deribit’s DVOL indexes, a comprehensive 30-day to maturity measure of option implied volatility (think the VIX of BTC and the VIX of ETH), shows us that the typical implied volatility premium of ETH over BTC began to dissipate in reaction to macro news events.  In mid-January we saw a market adjustment from the Fed beginning to slow down its hawkishness. This sent BTC higher and BTC IV (implied volatility) relatively higher (chart goes down).  Then in early February we saw a major outperformance linked to the Labor Department’s monthly non-farm payrolls (NFP) number. This quickly killed the idea of a Fed hawkish slowdown; BTC dropped (along with gold and other interest-rate sensitive assets) and BTC IV went down, relative to ETH IV (chart goes up).  The SVB crisis again nudged BTC IV higher, only to be temporarily paused by the ETH Shanghai upgrade.  Today, ETH IV trades around parity to BTC IV, even briefly at a discount.  Where does this leave us for the second half of 2023?  The Fed remains in a “wait-and-see” mode, after recently doing a “rate skip” at their June FOMC meeting. Although other central banks continue to raise rates, the U.S. macro picture is moving into the background as crypto specific news events become “top-of-mind.”  The regulatory events surrounding Binance, Coinbase and XRP are becoming major drivers of activity.  Today, BTC is defined as a commodity, while ETH’s categorization is more ambiguous.  This means there’s increased sensitivity for ETH’s “technology bet” narrative around regulation. A lot of ETH’s value comes from its utilization and the various DeFi, NFT and ERC-20 protocols built on top of the Ethereum infrastructure.  Lately, volatility surrounding the consumer price index (CPI), NFP and other macro events seems to have settled down, while regulatory clarity around crypto, a potential spot ETF approval and the XRP resolution is becoming a key focus; this paradigm shift could lead the market towards higher beta “altcoins” in the crypto space.  Historically, altcoins have outperformed BTC in bull markets, and the second half of 2023 is off to a bullish start, so far accompanied by mostly favorable crypto-specific news headlines.  That the recent events have increased ETH IV relative to BTC IV offers a hint that option traders are also paying attention.  - Greg Magadini, CFA Amberdata  Ask an Advisor  I help clients include crypto in their retirement accounts.  – Bryan Courchesne, CEO Daim  Q: Can advisors invest in crypto in 401K (retirement) accounts for their clients?  A: The short answer is yes, you can invest crypto in a range of retirement accounts from 401K plans to individual retirement accounts. First, make sure that you are speaking to a licensed investment advisor. Investment management is highly regulated so your Bitcoin advisor should be properly licensed. Ask for the advisor and their firm’s CRD #. You can look it up on brokercheck.org to vet that they are legit.  Q: Can my clients hold crypto in these accounts, or just funds?  A: Short answer both. The accounts could hold pure crypto, a crypto futures fund, a trust product (Like GBTC), or equities like COIN stock (which the company holds pure Bitcoin on their balance sheet.) In any investment besides pure crypto the main things to consider are tracking differences from the underlying and different fee structures.  Keep Reading  BlackRocks’s Bitcoin ETF application was “accepted” by the SEC, moving it to the next stage of consideration.  Dan Morehead, Pantera Capitals founder predicts it’s time to rally, the bull market is coming. With over 10,000% returns on their crypto hedge fund, Dan has my attention.

42410154,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcTyh5,1689855574,First Mover Americas: XRP Momentum Could Set Precedent for Bitcoin,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin spot ETFs could increase BTC demand to the tune of $30 billion, according to a report by NYDIG. The crypto trading firm estimates that there are $27.6 billion in spot-like products, compared with $210 billion invested in funds for gold, to which bitcoin is often compared. “Bitcoin is about 3.6x more volatile than gold, meaning that on a volatility equivalent basis, investors would require 3.6x less bitcoin than gold on a dollar basis to get as much risk exposure. Still, that would result in nearly $30B of incremental demand for a bitcoin ETF,” NYDIG writes. The possibility of a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S. looks far more likely since BlackRock submitted an application to list one with a “surveillance-sharing” agreement, which the SEC sees as necessary to prevent market manipulation.  El Salvador’s junk-rated bonds due 2027 have seen a substantial upward trend in the last six months amid bitcoin’s rally, defying some analysts’ expectations. The Central American country, which made BTC legal tender in 2021, had its debt rating downgraded by Fitch last September with a prediction of a debt default in January. In fact, the junk-rated bonds are up 62% since the start of 2023 and are trading at 72 cents on the dollar. Bitcoin rose 79% in the same period. El Salvador’s bonds have, however, even outperformed the Invesco Emerging Markets Sovereign Debt ETF (PCY), one of the largest holders of the country’s debt, according to Factset.  Kuwait’s financial regulator has banned crypto payments, investment and mining as a means to combat money laundering. The prohibitions are aimed at coming into compliance with the Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) global recommendations for crypto assets, according to the regulator. ""Securities regulated by the Central Bank of Kuwait and other securities and financial instruments regulated by the Capital Markets Authority are excluded from this prohibition,"" the regulator said in a circular. FATF compliance does require guardrails against money laundering, but the international watchdog says it has not asked any countries to ban crypto, it told CoinDesk in May.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows XRP's social dominance, which measures the percentage of social media discussions related to a cryptocurrency compared to all top 100 coins, has shot up to highest since January 2021.  Increased crowd chatter is often observed at interim market tops.

Beginning July 18, this surge has taken the digital asset on a solid price rally, propelling its value to new heights. Currently, XLM is trading at $0.1617, representing a 22.1% increase over the past 24 hours. Even more remarkable is its exceptional performance over the previous week, which has soared by 68.8%, and dominating the top 100 roster of cryptocurrencies. Source: Coingecko Now, the question on everyone’s mind is: What is driving this surge? XLM Makes Waves: Catalysts For Price Surge XLM’s remarkable ascent is primarily attributed to a significant development in the crypto space – Ripple Labs’s legal victory against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – and the solid performance of XRP, which has likewise registered an impressive 72.3% climb at the time of writing.

But it looks like the bulls are still in charge, as XLM trade volumes are relatively high. CoinGecko reports that within the past 24 hours, almost $700 million worth of XLM has traded hands on key exchanges. What Lies Ahead For Stellar XLM? As the crypto market continues to evolve, all eyes are on XLM to see if it can sustain its current momentum. With the legal challenges surrounding Ripple and its XRP token seeing full closure, investors may view Stellar as a more stable alternative for their digital assets portfolio.

According to data from CoinMarketCap, LINK is up by 16.94% in the last 24 hours, emerging as one of the biggest daily gainers in the crypto market. What’s Driving LINK’s Price Today? According to the on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain, LINK’s price gain appears to have been triggered by some recent whale activity. Lookonchain reports that two whale addresses, “0xc212” and “0x86bd,” which they suspect belong to the same person, purchased $6 million worth of LINK in the early hours of Thursday. 2 whales (probably the same person) bought a total of 788,877 $LINK ($6 million) for $7.62 just now.

However, LINK investors are advised to monitor the next move of these whales due to the possible effects on the market. Chainlink has been one of the major blockchain projects in the news this week following the launch of its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) on July 17. According to a blog post by the project’s management team, the CCIP protocol is expected to be accessible to developers on various testnets starting from July 20. These testnets include Arbitrim Goerli, Avalanche Fuji, Ethereum Sepolia, Optimism Goerli, and Polygon Mumbai. LINK Price Analysis And Prediction Analyzing the daily LINK chart, the Relative Strength Index shows the token has entered the overbought zone and is likely to reverse soon. This prediction is further backed by the token’s price movement, which shows that LINK is approaching a significant resistance at the $9.1 zone, which has not been broken in the last 14 months.

42410153,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcTyaT,1689854400,Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX Get Spoofed in New Animated Comedy Starring T.J. Miller,"If you ever thought the FTX saga seemed destined for a television adaptation, the entertainment industry agrees with you. Last year’s collapse of the rotten-to-the-core crypto exchange is the inspiration for an upcoming animated comedy called “FORTUN3.”  The series, created by upstart Web3 studio Toonstar, is a send-up of the crypto-bro culture that FTX thrived in, complete with a protagonist partially based on its former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, or SBF.  Announced at Comic-Con, “FORTUN3,” which premieres this fall, will serve as a kind of origin story for SBF and FTX – the products of an easy-money culture mixed with unbridled tech optimism, explains John Attanasio, co-founder and CEO of Toonstar. Besides the FTX parody, viewers can expect references to other business boondoggles driven by egomaniacs with a messiah complex (think: Theranos and WeWork). T.J. Miller of “Silicon Valley” fame will voice the SBF clone.  “[The series] is based on a real-life cast of characters that lend themselves very well to cartoons,” Attanasio told CoinDesk. “We're going to be taking the stuff that you see in the headlines and then bring that into the series.”  “FORTUN3” is the latest in Toonstar’s “interactive series,” which add a generous helping of Web3 to give fans avenues to participate in the creative experience. The studio treats community participation via NFT-based applications as its key differentiator – an idea ready for a wider audience, Attanasio believes.  “Through the narrative, there’s going to be a lot of universal themes that hopefully will appeal to [people] not more versed in crypto,” he said. “We also believe that entertainment can be one of the use cases that can help take Web3 mainstream.”  In the case of “FORTUN3,” viewers will be able to level-up their involvement in the series via an online game – which users can access via an NFT – which will be set in the same universe. While the exact gameplay is yet to be revealed, it will involve some kind of market – one that will be deeply affected by events in the show. Considering the effect of FTX’s collapse in the real world, fans should expect a bumpy ride.  Besides Miller, the “FORTUN3” cast includes Jon Heder (best known for the movie “Napoleon Dynamite”) and actress/model Amber Rose in its supporting cast. Heder co-founded Verified Labs, a creative agency that partners with Toonstar on Web3 projects. Their last collaboration was “Space Junk”, which also starred Heder and premiered at CoinDesk’s Consensus conference in April.  After its experience with “Space Junk,” Toonstar learned a lesson about artificial intelligence (AI) and its potential to be an accelerator for deepening the kind of fan engagement the studio is looking for, according to Luisa Huang, COO of Toonstar.  “AI is such a powerful companion tool for community engagement,” she said. “Having an AI companion as a co-pilot, to be a kind of creative partner, has been so successful to get the community active in participating. In Space Junk, we had [an AI] ‘co-pilot’ for story creation. And what we saw was that there was basically almost a 30x conversion rate [when using the AI].”  From the Comic-Con debut to the casting of Miller, it’s clear Toonstar sees the new series as its most mainstream play yet. While the title of the series is obviously ironic, it could turn out to be surprisingly apt if, from the ashes of FTX, “FORTUN3” could build success in Web3 entertainment.

Tesla Holding On To Its BTC The electric car company, Tesla, helmed by billionaire inventor Elon Musk recently announced that it had held on to its BTC reserves for the second quarter of 2023. Tesla (TSLA) remained inactive in the Bitcoin market, refraining from any purchases or sales of the cryptocurrency for the fourth consecutive quarter. The company's earnings release, issued after the market's closing on Wednesday, confirmed this trend. Tesla’s Digital Assets The value of Tesla's digital assets at the end of the quarter held steady at $184 million, the same figure reported for the past three quarters. During Q2, the price of Bitcoin experienced a slight increase, rising from approximately $28,500 at the end of Q1 to around $30,400. However, accounting regulations restricted Tesla from adjusting the valuation of its digital assets upwards in response to rising BTC prices unless the assets were sold. Nonetheless, the valuation could be reduced in the event of price declines, even before any sales occurred. Tesla’s BTC Investment Tesla initially acquired $1.5 billion worth of BTC in early 2021, which significantly boosted the crypto’s demand and price tag. CEO Elon Musk had also simultaneously made the announcement back then that the company would accept BTC payments for the Tesla cars, spurring even further interest in the crypto, which soon hit its all-time highest. However, Musk soon rescinded this proposal, declaring that BTC needed to be more environmentally friendly for this to happen. Selling Off 75% BTC Tesla, however, had to divest a significant portion of its BTC reserves in the second quarter of 2022 over liquidity concerns. The Tesla Gigafactory in Shanghai had been shut down for over 2 months due to the Covid-19 pandemic, resulting in a serious liquidity crisis for the company. It had to sell off over 30,000 BTCs, which amounted to about 75% of its holdings at the point, raking in a whopping $936 million, leaving around 9720 BTCs in its reserves. In its latest report, the company revealed that since then, it had not engaged in any BTC transactions, neither selling nor buying. Even during the significant market upheaval of January 2023, the company continued to hodl its BTC, despite amassing a loss of $140 million on its net Bitcoin holdings in 2022. Tesla’s Reported Earnings Regarding its financial performance, Tesla reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.91 for the second quarter. This result surpassed the consensus analyst estimate of $0.80, as reported by FactSet. Moreover, the company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $24.9 billion, exceeding analyst estimates of $24.2 billion. Throughout Q2 2023, Tesla's bitcoin holdings remained constant, showcasing the company's decision to remain on the sidelines of the volatile cryptocurrency market. Despite this, Tesla's financial performance and stock price continue to exhibit strength and resilience. As the electric car industry continues to evolve, investors and analysts keep a close eye on Tesla's movements in both the traditional markets and the ever-changing world of digital assets.

42393030,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgF3OJ,1689854112,UK Financial Regulator to Introduce Isolated Environment for Testing Financial Applications,"The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) plans to provide access to a digital sandbox, or testing environment, for firms to see how their products perform at an early stage of development, the regulator said on its website on Thursday.  The sandbox, which started operating on a trial basis in 2020, is also open to data providers and will offer firms access to data sets, application program interfaces (API) and data security protection. During one of the two pilot phases, it was used to evaluate sustainability performance, including eco-friendly decentralized ledgers.  A sandbox provides a secure setting in which developers can test and evaluate their products in the knowledge that any unintended side effects will be isolated from a live environment. While not currently configured so, the FCA's offering can be configured to support a number of distributed ledgers and digital-asset use cases, like building interoperability between networks, according to a person familiar with the project.  Former Economic Secretary John Glen set out plans for the sandbox in a speech last year, in which he said he wanted the country to foster crypto innovation, a sentiment echoed by his successor, Andrew Griffith.  Previously, the sandbox was available only during pilots and TechSprints, which brought people from the financial industry together to address industry challenges.

42393040,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgF4Db,1689851411,Bitcoin Trading in Japan Rises as Yen Turns Volatile,"Since the Federal Reserve (Fed) started its aggressive interest rate hike campaign in March 2022, the Japanese yen has depreciated sharply, registering one of the most severe exchange rate turbulence on record.  The volatility has traders from Japan-focused digital assets exchanges turning to bitcoin (BTC), the world's leading cryptocurrency by market value, widely touted as a hedge against traditional finance.  The share of bitcoin trade volume on Japanese exchanges rose from 69% to 80% in the first six months of the year, according to data tracked by Paris-based Kaiko. The total trading volume on Japanese exchanges was $4 billion in June, amounting to a 60% year-to-date surge.  The share of the bitcoin-Japanese yen (BTC/JPY) pair in total volume in bitcoin-fiat trading pairs has also increased from 4% to 11% this year.  ""It signals rising appetite on Japanese markets,"" Dessislava Aubert, research analyst at Kaiko, said in an email. Kaiko's aggregate figures for Japan represent data from Bitflyer, Coincheck, Bitbank, Quoine, and Zaif.  Bitcoin is widely considered a digital gold and a hedge against traditional finance and fiat currencies, which are said to lack intrinsic or fixed value and are not backed by any tangible asset. Citizens from countries ridden with inflation and fiat currency volatility have previously embraced digital assets.  Bitcoin has surged 84% to over $30,000 this year while trading at a premium on Japanese exchanges.  ""On average, BTC traded at a premium ranging between 0.5% and 1.25% on Japanese markets this year,"" Dessislava Aubert, research analyst at Kaiko, said in an email.  The yen has depreciated 6.3% against the U.S. dollar this year, extending the past year's near 14% slide. The divergent monetary policy paths adopted by the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan, which has maintained its pro-easing stance amid global tightening, have been primarily responsible for the yen's decline.  The chart shows trading activity on Japan-focused exchanges has picked up faster than Korean markets and the Nasdaq-listed Coinbase exchange.  The trend might continue considering Japan already has a regulatory framework, unlike the U.S. where authorities still rely on enforcement to oversee the industry. Last month, Japan passed a landmark stablecoin bill for investor protection.  The yen volatility will likely persist as speculation is simmering that the Bank of Japan could announce a hawkish tweak to its policy next week.  Lastly, the unthinkable is happening – inflation is rising in Japan and a key gauge that excludes energy component recently hit a four-decade high. Higher inflation after decades of chronic deflation may see more robust demand for perceived alternatives like bitcoin.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/20/bitcoin-trading-in-japan-rises-as-yen-turns-volatile,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9461780da418ec2ba80726da9850e94f8acd4a01-1306x698.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to the Kuwaiti Capital Markets Authority, in a circular published on Monday, it has banned all crypto-related activities by companies, it has placed an absolute ban on all digital asset mining, and, into the bargain, has prohibited that crypto be recognised as a decentralised currency. The only exception to this are securities regulated by the central bank, or the Capital Markets Authority. ""Securities regulated by the Central Bank of Kuwait and other securities and financial instruments regulated by the Capital Markets Authority are excluded from this prohibition,"" The Kuwaiti anti-crypto actions were purportedly taken in order to come into line with recommendations from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global financial organisation that is obliging nation states to come into compliance for what it sees as anti money-laundering (AML) and terrorist financing threats. However, according to an article on Coindesk, the FATF has not asked countries to ban crypto. Be that as it may, this regulator holds much power, and not complying with its ‘recommendations’ can land a country onto the FATF blacklist. Opinion Some might argue that the FATF’s recommendations do more harm than good from an economic perspective. There are cases where banks pull out of lending to countries in poorer regions of the world because they fear the fines they can incur from the added difficulty of being able to adequately identify customers. Also, the cost of running the organisation should be measured against the costs of the illegal activity it is purportedly stopping. AML has now entered into almost every financial activity that a government can make, and the costs of compliance that all companies have to endure just to be able to go about their business can be a reason for concern. In Springer Link, under “Crime, Law and Social Change” author Mark. T. Nance goes into a deep dive on the FATF. In the introduction he asks the question as to how there can be an increase in illicit money at the same time as the “global governance regime” is getting bigger to fight it. He looks at the expert detractors of the FATF, and what they say makes interesting reading: “Detractors portray FATF as a faceless, unaccountable, de facto global regulatory agency run amok. On behalf of the interests of a few select states, it imposes regulations that are illegitimate and costly. For these critics, the Panama Papers are evidence that the rules are ineffective, to boot.” Banning an emerging technology in order to become compliant with an agency controlled by certain countries, with their own interests in mind is certainly a difficult call for Kuwait to make.

These tokens, amounting to roughly 2.4 trillion according to WhaleAlert, have been transferred to an unknown wallet. 🚨 2,416,836,656,676 #SHIB (18,771,570 USD) transferred from #BinanceUS to unknown wallethttps://t.co/8ujqIZ5C5i — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) July 19, 2023 This movement of SHIB tokens is particularly noteworthy as this comes amid the anticipation which is running high as Shytoshi Kusama, the lead developer of Shiba Inu, hinted at the upcoming release of Shibarium mainnet and Worldpaper in August. Whale Alert Triggers Market Speculation According to Whale Alert, the blockchain tracking and analytics provider, the wallet transfer from Binance.US to an unknown wallet comprised approximately 2,416,836,656,676 SHIB tokens, which, at the time of transfer, were worth around $18.77 million. Related Reading: Shibarium Reaches New Milestones As Anticipation Builds For Mainnet Launch Though this transaction could be interpreted as a positive sign, suggesting that ‘whales’, or large-scale investors, are acquiring and hoarding SHIB tokens by moving their SHIB asset to an unknown, privately-held wallet, signaling their intent to hold for an extended period. However, a deep dive into Etherscan data also shows that Binance.US has since been shuffling tokens to a fresh wallet address identified as 0x058A over the past couple of days. This wallet, interestingly, now holds a mix of 69 different tokens collectively valued at $72.62 million. Regardless, the Shiba Inu community is abuzz with chatter about this monumental transfer. Many community members have speculated that this activity may be linked to the upcoming launch of Shibarium, further stoking the anticipation for August’s much-awaited release. Bullish Wave Ahead For SHIB While it’s still unclear what the whale’s aim behind this move is all about, given the fundamental metrics, Shiba Inu might actually be closer to a bullish wave. Shiba Inu Lead Developer, Shytoshi Kusama, announced earlier this month, the Shiba Inu Ecosystem will be the title sponsor for the Blockchain Futurist Conference, Eth Toronto, and Eth Women – events to take place in Toronto in August where the team could launch Shibarium. These events could serve as a catalyst that ushers in another rally for the meme coin. Related Reading: Breaking: Shiba Inu Lead Dev Reveals Shibarium Release Date, SHIB Up 3% Meanwhile, over the past week, SHIB has been performing quite well. The meme coin has managed to breach several resistance levels and currently trades at $0.00000782, marking a nearly 5% uptick over the previous week. SHIB’s market capitalization currently stands at $4.6 billion, which elevates it to the 16th spot in the ranking of cryptocurrencies by market cap. Adding to this bullish narrative, SHIB’s trading volume has also seen a considerable boost in the past seven days, soaring from $74.4 million to $87 million in the last 24 hours. This positive momentum is partly due to the broader crypto market trend, led by Bitcoin’s recent rally.

42393034,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgF3dh,1689850366,Myanmar Shadow Government to Start Neobank With Crypto Rails to Fund Fight Against Military Junta,"Myanmar’s shadow government, the National Unity Government (NUG), is set to start a neobank, which will run on Polygon and do currency swaps via Uniswap v3 pools and USDT stablecoins.  The bank plans to offer users currency swap, fixed deposits and prize-linked savings account services. Its web-based app will have a beta launch on July 22, and be available on Google Play and Apple’s App Store, a spokesperson for the bank said at a virtual press conference held on Thursday.  Led by supporters of the ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi, the Spring Development Bank (SDB), will target Suu Kyi supporters as customers, including the Burmese diaspora, the spokesperson said. The NUG’s stance is that it is the legitimate sovereign and government of Myanmar, not the military junta.  SDB's stated objectives are to disrupt the country’s financial system, controlled by the military government, the State Administration Council (SAC). In addition to accessing banking services, users will be able to donate directly to the revolutionary effort via SDB. It plans to deploy funds via the most efficient routes and help rebuild post-revolution Myanmar.  Myanmar has been sanctioned by various governing bodies including the U.S. and the EU over the February 2021 military coup that overthrew the civilian government, and ensuing human rights violations.  The NUG has been raising funds to challenge the SAC since 2021. Its efforts include issuing revolutionary bonds and auctioning off a villa held by army general Min Aung Hlaing. The NUG’s hope is that when it regains power, it will confiscate the house and give the sale proceeds to buyers.  The bank  The NUG’s Ministry of Planning, Finance and Investment is the sole shareholder of the bank. SDB’s shares will be offered to the public in two phases, the spokesperson said.  A pre-initial coin offering (ICO) round with the bank’s own token will be exclusively for SDB account holders and the first ICO round will be offered to institutional investors. The bank said that it will also raise funds via remittance, currency exchange, loans, and other monetary products.  SDB aims to onboard 100,000 active users in six months’ time.  It is set to support four currencies: the Myanmar kyat (MMK), U.S. dollar, Singaporean dollar and Thai baht.  “MMK will be swapped to USDT stablecoin,” an SDB spokesperson told CoinDesk. “The rest will be kept in the original or native currency to minimize currency and exchange risk.”  The NUG recognized stablecoin Tether (USDT) as legal tender at the end of last year.  Using SDB, there is a 2% spread on exchange swap, a more appealing rate than other options on the market. (At the time of this article’s publication, the reference exchange rate was 1 Singapore dollar to 2320 MMK on SDB, compared to 2164 on Western Union.) The bank also plans to launch an e-lottery program on the platform where tickets will be issued to customers as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  Security  The bank will comply with the Basel Accords and Financial Action Task Force (FATF) regulations, the spokesperson said.  “Normal savings account balances will not be loaned out,” the spokesperson said.  The SDB spokesperson also explained that the bank has various layers of segregation of data, funds and different ‘vaults’ to separate customer funds.  “Our cyber security team (including red team and internal hackers) are working extra hard to protect users’ data security,” the spokesperson said.  For currency swaps, users will be able to deposit foreign currency into the bank and receive stablecoin in return. When the exchange rate is to their liking, they can exchange their foreign currency stablecoin for kyat stablecoin and use a local agent to swap that into cash within Myanmar.  On how they would protect local agents, the spokesperson said that they would draw on two and a half years’ worth of experience in protecting the safety and security of revolutionary forces.  Myanmar has a population of 55 million, many of them young, tech-savvy, and well-versed in VPN use to access content on the internet. QR code payments are more prevalent in Yangon than Singapore. While a predominantly cash-based society, it has extensive and fast 5G coverage with most of its network communications provided by Huawei.

In May, the House of Commons’ Treasury Committee expressed concern that government plans to apply rules broadly similar to those for traditional finance to crypto treats the sector too softly, creating a halo effect that makes people think investing in bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH) is safe.  “The Government firmly disagrees with the Committee’s recommendation” concerning retail crypto trading and investment, the Treasury response said.  “A system of gambling regulation, in isolation, would be unlikely to address these risk factors” such as the commingling of customer funds alleged of crypto exchange FTX, or correct problems linked to insider trading and market manipulation that are covered by traditional financial regulation, the government added.  “The recommendation to rely on gambling regulation would represent a fundamental departure from the Government’s intended approach which reflects recommendations from global standard-setting bodies,” the government said, citing recommendations from the Financial Stability Board recently endorsed by finance ministers from the world’s 20 leading economies, and warning that divergence would merely push crypto offshore.

42393037,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgF3nx,1689848398,SEC’s Stuttering Litigation Strategy Draws Comment From France,"PARIS, France – Officials in France are boasting of the regulatory certainty they can offer, as U.S. enforcers wage a fierce – if not entirely successful – war on crypto.  With a crypto registration regime in effect for years, new EU laws known as MiCA set to take effect in 2024, and lawmakers discussing a regime for gaming involving non-fungible tokens (NFTs), officials are bullish about the country’s preparedness for Web3, a conference organized by lobby group ADAN was told.  MiCA, which lets wallet providers and exchanges operate across the EU with a single license, “will allow this sector to go to the next gear in terms of regulatory requirements,” said Marie-Anne Barbat-Layani, adding that France’s Financial Markets Authority (AMF), the regulator which she chairs, is “resolutely open to innovation.”  Barbat-Layani contrasted France’s situation with that across the Atlantic.  “Some of our peers, notably the U.S. SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission], have launched litigation strategies – strategies of which the successes aren’t totally clear – but which seek to treat crypto as a traditional financial instrument,” she said. “It’s a different choice to that made in Europe.”  MiCA, which passed into law in June and takes full effect in December 2024, adapts existing rules for trading in financial instruments, while the SEC has taken action against a number of crypto companies including Binance and Coinbase, arguing that they should have registered as securities trading platforms under existing rules, and that certain tokens they’ve listed should have been registered as securities.  That U.S. approach may have met a setback last week with a ruling that found Ripple’s XRP token doesn’t necessarily fall under the current, century-old securities laws.  Undimmed  France has positioned itself as a crypto hub, and companies such as Binance have registered under its existing crypto law known as PACTE, which is administered by the AMF. On Tuesday, the AMF awarded its first ever crypto license to Forge, the financial-technology arm of the bank Societe Generale, a still more demanding process that already puts Forge largely in line with MiCA.  Being regulated comes with ups and downs – as Binance found recently, when it was raided by the Paris public prosecutor for “aggravated money laundering.” Binance has said it’s cooperating with investigators, and the incident doesn’t seem to have dimmed its enthusiasm for the country.  There’s “no reason” to leave France because of that probe, Binance France’s Executive Director for Legal Stéphanie Cabossioras told the conference, adding that recent events were just part of adapting to life as a traditional finance-style regulated entity. “There are little surprises … but it will become day-to-day life.”  While entrepreneurs in France may complain of high taxes, employment restrictions, and a paucity of investment available via venture capital, the country also offers bonuses beyond regulatory certainty, says the founder of one of the country’s crypto success stories, Ledger.  “Why is Ledger in France? Its foundational technology is the smart card,” asked Éric Larchevêque, Ledger’s former chief executive officer, of the chip-based hardware. “It’s a French innovation, a technology really mastered in France… but not at all in the U.S.”  Gambling  Now, France is hoping to build on its regulatory success by legislating for a new regime for Web3-style games involving monetizable digital objects – tradable merchandise that gives rights within the game and whose value can be increased by playing more – known by its French acronym of JONUM.  If lawmakers agree a framework in the fall, there could be a “text by the end of the year,”  Isabelle Falque Pierrotin, chair of France’s National Gambling Authority (ANJ) told the event – adding that her preference was for legislation to merely set high-level objectives, such as protecting children, allowing her to negotiate details with the sector.  In May, French Web3 company Sorare, under regulatory pressure, announced changes to its NFT soccer game for the domestic market – though the ANJ only intended these as a short-term fix pending legislative changes.  If enacted, some believe those new gaming laws could make a real difference.  “What is currently being foreseen, the last versions of the regime that were discussed in the Senate a few weeks ago, show a true will and a true possibility of positioning France as the real pioneer and leader on this topic,” said Matthieu Lucchesi, an innovation and fintech specialist at law firm Gide255, adding that the law needed to be “well-calibrated” in order to be appealing.

At the same time, the market remained under the bulls’ control. Furthermore, the on-chain metrics displayed promising performance. Notably, the number of active users experienced a gradual uptick, and an extraordinary surge in smart contract deployment on the platform was also observed. Could this impressive on-chain performance indicate even more significant potential for Solana in the future? Analyzing SOL’s Performance According to data from Coingecko, the current trading price of SOL has reached $26.58, marking a 1.0% increase in the past 24 hours. Even more striking is the remarkable seven-day rally, where SOL has surged by an impressive 21.7%. Source: Coingecko These metrics indicate a positive sentiment surrounding the cryptocurrency and suggest potential opportunities for investors and traders. While a slight loss of bullish momentum may have been observed in the lower timeframes, the 1-day chart revealed substantial bullish potential for SOL. A SOL price report suggests that despite minor fluctuations in shorter periods, the overall outlook for SOL remains optimistic, especially considering the strong performance of the bulls throughout July. Strength In Bullish Momentum And Demand Two critical indicators, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the On-Balance Volume (OBV), further support the bullish outlook for SOL. The RSI showcased robust bullish momentum, indicating that the buying pressure has been significant during the recent price surge. Related Reading: BNB Chain Unveils Beacon Update – What’s Its Bearing On Price? SOL market cap currently at $10 billion.

This innovative tool addresses the fundamental differences between the Solana ecosystem and the Ethereum blockchain network, particularly concerning the programming languages utilized in their designs. 1/ 🎉Introducing Solang: Building on Solana with Solidity Today, @solanalabs announces Solang, a compiler enabling developers to write smart contracts on Solana in Solidity, the primary programming language of Ethereum.https://t.co/X703sAMJBC Learn more👇 — Solana (@solana) July 19, 2023 With Solang, developers can now write Solana programs using the popular Solidity programming language predominantly associated with the Ethereum network. This integration is a direct gateway for launching decentralized applications (dApps) on Solana, providing an excellent opportunity for applications to extend their value beyond their immediate ecosystems. This cross-chain compatibility will likely encourage developers to explore the vast potential of Solana’s high throughput, low latency, and cost-efficient platform for building sophisticated dApps.

According to local news reports, the police have arrested 21 individuals in connection with the money laundering ring. A Major Bust The laundering operation came to light when authorities in Qinshui County observed that a bank account operated under the name of Mouyue Zhao had a highly erratic flow of funds. This abnormal flow of funds sparked suspicions of money laundering, leading to the police launching a thorough investigation. The investigation revealed staggering details about how an organized group of criminals had been orchestrating an over-the-counter (OTC) trading ring involving USDT since October 2021, according to a report by China’s national broadcasting service. USDT is the world’s largest stablecoin and has its value pegged to the US Dollar. It is operated by Tether Limited Inc. Modus Operandi Investigators revealed that the accused individuals operated across four provinces, purchasing USDT at a low price and then selling it at higher prices through WeChat groups and money laundering platforms and making significant illegal profits. Authorities stated that the laundering operation had completed transactions totaling nearly $55 million over the nearly three-year period of their operations. Authorities were able to track down members of the operation across six cities in the provinces of Jiangxi, Henan, Guangxi, and Anhui. Over 50 officers were dispatched to arrest the perpetrators. Along with the arrests, the police also seized over 40 mobile phones, along with 200,000 yuan ($28,000) in cash and over 1 million yuan worth of USDT ($140,000). Suspects Confess The suspects were interrogated by the authorities and, according to local news agencies, have confessed to the accusations made against them. The accusations include facilitating the conversion of the Chinese Yuan to USDT and helping criminals launder their money. However, the case is still open and remains under investigation. According to the authorities, USDT has quickly become a preferred choice for crypto money launderers thanks to the ease and anonymity that it offers. China’s Stance On Crypto China has historically taken a tough stance against crypto. However, the country’s stance comes as no surprise to long-time observers of the crypto space. Chinese citizens first caught wind of cryptocurrencies in 2011 thanks to the centralized exchange Bitcoin China, set up by Bobby C. Lee. Bobby C. Lee is the brother of Litecoin’s Charlie Lee. During the early days of Bitcoin, Bitcoin China was responsible for a significant chunk of the global Bitcoin trading activity. Bitcoin soon became widely accepted in China, with businesses beginning to accept it as payment. However, 2013 saw China’s first attempt at stifling the crypto space in the country, even though Bitcoin adoption was skyrocketing, with the People’s Bank of China prohibiting banks from holding or transacting in digital currencies. However, Chinese citizens could still buy, send, and store crypto. During the 2017 bull run, Chinese authorities put further sanctions on the crypto space, outlawing all platforms offering ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings). Additionally, authorities also forced several exchanges to shut down operations. In 2021, Chinese officials banned crypto mining, effectively crippling the industry in China. The impact on the markets was severe, with Bitcoin’s hash rate falling to 50% and its price registering a dramatic drop. Along with the ban on mining, authorities also outlawed all crypto trading and transactions. Additionally, anyone working with Chinese firms associated with the crypto space could potentially face jail time.

42393035,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgF3ip,1689843717,Proposed Legal Reforms Aid UK Crypto Dreams – but Offer Scant Hope for Bitcoin Developers Sued by Craig Wright,"A recent paper on crypto ownership rights from the Law Commission of England and Wales has gained plaudits from politicians and the legal sector – but alone won’t resolve other legal uncertainties like developer liability, as some in the industry are hoping.  Proponents of decentralization believe the underlying code in digital asset transactions enforces applicable laws and regulations. In practice, as the beleaguered victims of crypto hacks, frauds and bankruptcy have found, sometimes the courts are the only way to get your assets back – and the Law Commission’s proposals for new legislation could be offering them an extra way to do so, lawyers told CoinDesk.  Some parties to crypto litigation are also finding comfort in the Commission’s report, convinced it could tip the scales in favor of a group of Bitcoin developers targeted by Craig Wright, the infamous crypto scientist who says he is the real author of the Bitcoin white paper attributed to pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto.  But lawyers say the proposal doesn’t address other legal concerns beyond token ownership, and that there is plenty of work left to do to ensure legal certainty and make the U.K. a crypto hub.  The weight of the proposals  Politicians certainly see the Commission’s proposals as welcome – including in a key cross-party parliamentary group known as the APPG on Crypto and Digital Assets, which considered legal classification issues in a recent inquiry.  “The APPG welcomes the work of the Law Commission in this important area,” Lisa Cameron, the group’s chair, told CoinDesk in a statement, urging the government to “move quickly on the legal classification of these assets where this may provide further clarity for the sector, regulators and the legal system.”  Legal reforms “could help achieve the Government’s goal for the U.K. to become a global hub for cryptocurrency and digital assets,” added Cameron, a Westminster lawmaker for the opposition Scottish National Party, citing the ambitions first voiced by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak last April when he was finance minister.  But, even before the government and lawmakers get their teeth into that, just having a clear position from the Law Commission helps offer greater certainty to those in the sector, Etay Katz, partner and head of digital assets at Ashurst law firm, told CoinDesk in an interview.  “We've got a pretty categorical statement of what the law is and should be like,” Katz said. “It’s as good as a statute.”  There’s precedent for believing the Commission’s dream will become reality. Its draft bill on using blockchain for trade documents has now passed through Parliament and could have a global impact.  Likewise, the Commission’s new report “paves the way for more developments, and for English law and the English courts being seminal in matters of digital assets moving forward,” Katz said – but warned there are still plenty of issues that need to be addressed.  Read more: UK Trade Groups See Opportunity in Document Bill Under Debate in Parliament  Wright V. Bitcoin devs  At the heart of the Commission’s paper is the recommendation that – with some minor exceptions – the treatment of crypto should be left to the common law, rather than hoping lawmakers can predict every possibility in all-encompassing legislation.  Common law, determined and developed by courts, in theory allows a less rigid approach as judges can respond case by case. The Commission cites cases where judges allowed legal documents to be served via non-fungible tokens (NFT), for example, adapting legal procedures to a new reality.  Yet the legal status of digital assets still isn’t completely resolved. The Commission has at best set the legal position on a particular track, but the final destination isn’t set yet and the process will inevitably take time, Lizzie Williams, a managing associate at law firm Harbottle & Lewis, told CoinDesk.  But the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund, a nonprofit set up by former Twitter chief Jack Dorsey to assist developers facing lawsuits, insisted in a July 4 blog that the Commission’s report had far-reaching implications in Wright’s U.K. case against a dozen Bitcoin Core developers and “undermines the central claims” of the suit.  Tulip Trading’s Craig Wright sued the developers, arguing they must rewrite code to give him access to 111,000 bitcoin (BTC) whose private keys were allegedly stolen.  The U.K. Court of Appeal agrees there’s a serious issue to be tried, but hasn’t yet given any substantive judgment on the case. The Law Commission’s report refers to the case, and even suggests a rule of thumb for when developers are liable – implying there’s no case to answer if they don’t retain control over tokens – but the implications may not be as wide as defendants say.  “The conclusions of our report do not directly affect the question of developers’ claimed fiduciary duties,” though a related project underway on decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) may bear on the subject, a Law Commission spokesperson told CoinDesk in an emailed statement.  While the report may constitute helpful guidance, the Law Commission is more concerned about ownership of assets than their underlying networks, Louise Abbott, partner at Keystone Law said.  Read more: Craig Wright's UK Case Against 16 Bitcoin Developers to Go to Full Trial  Legislation  Some of the details still need to be nailed down in legislation. The Commission wants lawmakers in Parliament to pass a new law to clarify that people can own digital assets, even if they don’t fit into the same legal category as other things you can own like cars or debts.  It also suggested reviewing the laws about the tokenization of equity and securities to see if they need to be extended to cover permissionless ledgers – a topic lobbyists such as UK Finance have also shown interest in.  One is how you treat crypto that’s posted as surety for a loan – where Katz favors simply adding digital assets alongside cash and securities to an existing legislative list of permitted collateral. Another is having more consistency on the obligations of crypto custodians. Jurisdictions like the European Union have legislated on that issue – and Katz worries the U.K. is getting left behind by leaving it to individual contracts.  “So far, the U.K. is talking big words but doing very little in terms of pushing itself and positioning itself as a leader on policy,” he said. While the EU’s MiCA law is already finalized and set to take effect in 2024, a U.K. Treasury consultation on proposals for regulating the crypto sector has not yet been followed up with detailed provisions.  Read more: Crypto Industry Asks UK to Think Globally as Government Closes Consultation on Proposed Rules  “As a result, the bulk of the activity that is happening now in traditional finance using DLT is happening in Europe, and in Singapore and Hong Kong… I say that with an element of pain,” Katz said.  Though the Law Commission findings are welcome, he believes they’re not enough. “We need to move, in short order, to companies legislation, to regulation, to tax, and to any other area which is fundamentally important to the ecosystem,” Katz said.  Cameron also said in May that there is more actual “scope in terms of getting comprehensive policies around innovative technology, blockchain and Web3.”  Read more: How Crypto Might Shake Up England’s Ancient Property Laws",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION,"Jack Schickler, Camomile Shumba",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/20/proposed-legal-reforms-aid-uk-crypto-dreams-but-offer-scant-hope-for-bitcoin-developers-sued-by-craig-wright,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ddf9edcf81a6e42ef8bc8fe9daa65cd83b683b6d-2665x1499.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

15098906,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=543458,1689843652,Bitboy Predicts XRP Will Soar To $35 On Heels Of Ripple IPO,"In a recent tweet, Ben “BitBoy” Armstrong, a controversial figure in the crypto community, stirred discussions with a noteworthy projection for the future price of XRP. The excitement began when Evan Luthra, an angel investor and Forbes 30 under 30 award winner, tweeted, “XRP just surpassed BTC trading volume. It’s now the highest trading crypto asset. What’s your price target for Ripple?” Will XRP Rise to $35? BitBoy’s response can be classified as very bold when he said “$15 is reasonable, I think over 18 months or so. If they IPO and time it right, could be up to $35 imo. At the heart of Armstrongs projection is his belief in the long-term growth potential of XRP, with the projected price of $15 signifying a whopping 1,720% increase from its current price. This optimism may be bolstered by the recent legal victory by Ripple which has provided some clarity for XRP. Remarkably, BitBoy’s enthusiasm didn’t stop at $15, as he suggested that XRP’s price could potentially reach $35 if Ripple proceeds with an Initial Public Offering (IPO) and times it strategically. Achieving this target would necessitate a staggering surge of 4,200%. Related Reading: XRP Maintains Bullish Run With Nearly 80% Rally – Is $1 Within Reach? The rumors about an upcoming IPO of Ripple are not new. CEO Brad Garlinghouse hinted at the possibility already before the SEC lawsuit. It’s likely the agency threw a wrench in the company’s plans. Nevertheless, it is crucial to approach such forecasts with caution, as BitBoy himself acknowledged the inherent unpredictability of the crypto market. Cryptocurrencies are renowned for their price volatility and susceptibility to various external factors, making accurate predictions a challenging task. BityBoy added: Make no mistake… it may not go that high… but XRP IS breaking an all time high this cycle save some sort of pointless, vindictive SEC appeal. (Low chance) Also, the influencer’s optimistic outlook on XRP’s potential is not entirely new. In April, he had already identified XRP as his top altcoin pick for the next bull run, contingent on a favorable outcome in the SEC lawsuit. A positive resolution would provide the asset with much-needed legal and regulatory clarity, potentially acting as a further catalyst for growth. Related Reading: Bitcoin, XRP, & Ethereum: Three Top Coins On Brink Of Golden Cross In another tweet the influencer reacted to a Twitter user who stated “Everything is breaking ATH this cycle.” Armstrong answered that he doesn’t think so, revealing his picks for such altcoins, “Solana, Dogecoin, Shiba all potentially on that list. Previous top 10 coins that didn’t make new ath’s last cycle: NEM, NEO, Dash, BCH, XRP (for good reason) etc. Don’t fall into the same trap I did last cycle. Everything doesn’t perform.” Armstrong Is Not Without Controversy David Schwartz, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Ripple, called the BEN coin project a 100% rug pull two months ago. In response to a tweet, Schwartz wondered if the rug pull would happen in the future or if Bitboy’s involvement in the project was a rug pull. Schwartz concluded that he believed in both scenarios: Do you think the rug will be pulled in the future? Or do you think Bitboy joining the team is itself a rug pull? Because I definitely agree with either one. In addition, BitBoy was accused of defrauding or misleading his 1.44 million YouTube subscribers in 2022, as several pieces of evidence surfaced suggesting that he did not disclose the paid advertising content in his videos. At press time, the XRP price stood at $0.8219, up 4.6% in the last 24 hours.

The prohibitions are aimed at coming into compliance with the Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) global recommendations for crypto assets, and followed a study into the sector by the the National Committee for Combating Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism, according to the regulator.  Although countries are required to put up guardrails for preventing money laundering, and adhere to the FATF's travel rule – which requires crypto firms to collect and share data on transactions above a certain threshold – the international watchdog has not asked countries to ban crypto, it told CoinDesk in May.

Bitcoin holder El Salvador’s recent experience suggests the same.  Since Fitch downgraded El Salvador’s debt rating in September 2022 with a prediction of a debt default in January 2023, the country’s junk-rated bonds have skyrocketed, mirroring bitcoin’s meteoric rise throughout 2023.  According to market data, the value of El Salvador’s bonds are up 62%, and now trading at 72 cents on the dollar. During the same time period, bitcoin has risen 79%.  El Salvador’s bonds have even outperformed the Invesco Emerging Markets Sovereign Debt ETF (PCY), one of the largest holders of the country’s debt, according to Factset.  In January, the country announced it had repaid an $800 million bond which Moody’s predicted it would be unable to do.  El Salvador announced bitcoin as legal tender in mid-2021 and began accumulating the cryptocurrency from September 2021. As of April, the country holds 2546 bitcoin, according to calculations by Bloomberg. The digital assets were bought for $108.2 million, and are currently worth $76.6 million per current market data.  Separately, Volcano Energy recently announced $1 billion in commitments to build a 241 megawatt (MW) bitcoin mine in the Metapán region of El Salvador. Investors include Tether, the issuer of USDT.  Ratings agencies disapprove  El Salvador's decision to diversify into bitcoin has consistently drawn the ire of ratings agencies and the International Monetary Fund.  “Policy differences related to the government’s embrace of bitcoin have lowered the probability that an IMF (International Monetary Fund) deal will be reached in time to address the government’s upcoming January 2023 $800 million bond maturity,” Moody’s wrote last fall.  In 2021, S&P wrote that El Salvador’s decision to adopt bitcoin as a legal tender would have “immediate, negative implications.”  “The risks” of El Salvador’s bitcoin adoption “seem to outweigh its potential benefits,” S&P wrote at the time. “There are immediate negative implications for (the) credit.”  In February, the IMF said that risks regarding El Salvador’s embrace of bitcoin ""have not materialized due to the limited bitcoin use so far.""  ""Given the legal risks, fiscal fragility and largely speculative nature of crypto markets, the authorities should reconsider their plans to expand government exposures to bitcoin,"" the IMF said in a statement, reported by Reuters.

15097080,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=543452,1689839116,Cardano (ADA) Price Action Points To Potential Trend Reversal,"Cardano (ADA) is recently showing signs of a potential trend reversal. But after staging an impressive 48% rally from its low in June, the ADA price faces crucial hurdles to solidify its bullish stance. Cardano (ADA) Price Analysis Cardano enthusiasts have had their patience tested as the ADA price navigated through a series of ups and downs. Following a dip to $0.221 in June, Cardano embarked on an impressive 48% rally, fueled in part by positive sentiment stemming from the Ripple legal dispute with the SEC. During this period, the price surged to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level, sparking excitement among the bulls. However, enthusiasm soon waned as the buy side struggled to stabilize above the 200-day EMA (blue). ADA subsequently corrected back to the crucial breakout level at $0.30, where the bulls regained their footing and lifted the price above the EMA50 (orange). Bullish ADA Price Targets For the short-term outlook to brighten further, ADA needs to overcome some important hurdles. The first key resistance is at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level, sitting at $0.328. A successful push beyond this level could open the path for an attack towards the $0.355 mark, where the 200-day EMA poses its most significant challenge. Related Reading: Cardano Bulls Reclaim Control As ADA Rallies 28% However, an impulse from the broader crypto market, Bitcoin or also more positive news from the Ripple legal battle with the SEC is probably required for this. Only when the buy side can recapture the 200-day EMA on the daily closing price, the probability for a near-term trend reversal increases significantly. A sustained break of the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.38 is essential for a true bullish trend reversal. This milestone would increase the probability of revisiting the previous week’s high. For this, a breakout above the critical zone between $0.361 and $0.38 would be a trend reversal for the bulls. If successful, the ADA price could eye the local high of $0.399. Then, the next target becomes the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.415. Here, the fate of Cardano’s upward trajectory will be decided, with a potential push towards the April 15 annual high of $0.463. However, prudent investors should be prepared to take profits if ADA approaches this level. Related Reading: Cardano Development Activity Dropping – What Does It Mean For ADA Price? Beyond this point, an ongoing bullish scenario opens up possibilities to target the local high of September 10, 2022, at $0.524. And if the bullish momentum remains robust, the high of August 2022 at $0.590 could become the next objective. Bearish Price Targets While the upward trend is evident, a sustainable market structure change is not yet confirmed. The bears showed their presence on July 15, holding the ADA price below the “bear market line” represented by the 200-day EMA. However, the recent 21% correction saw the buy side reclaim control, at least for the time being. To initiate another sell-off, the bears need a daily close below the 50-day EMA at $0.311. Until that happens, the bulls can feel relatively secure in their position. A failure to do so may lead to a retest of the support zone between $0.30 and the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement at $0.296, with further correction potential towards the $0.266 support area. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) initially surged to 72 but has since settled into the neutral zone at 54. Generating a fresh buy signal will be crucial for a massive price increase, as an overheated RSI typically accompanies substantial rallies. On a positive note, the MACD indicator triggered a new long signal by crossing above the 0-line, adding to the short-term optimism.

The new compiler will help Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) developers transition to the Solana ecosystem. The move aligns with Solana’s efforts to become more accessible with Solidity, the programming language used with Ethereum smart contracts. A New Compiler The launch of Solang will help developers who have worked with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to transition into the Solana ecosystem smoothly. Solang gives developers who are familiar with Solidity, Ethereum’s primary smart contract programming language, all the tools required to write and create apps on the Solana network. The unveiling of the new compiler comes only a day after Neon EVM released a similar tool. In a statement published on its website, Solana Labs stated, “Solana development is well known for using Rust or C for writing smart contracts, but Solana is evolving to become more accessible with Solidity, the primary programming language used for Ethereum smart contracts. Solana Labs is thrilled to announce that today you can now build on Solana with Solidity using Solang, a new compiler that helps bridge the gap between EVM developers and the Solana ecosystem.” A List Of Features According to the statement, the addition of more programming languages for building on Solana will see an influx of developers with broader skill sets into the Solana ecosystem. This was witnessed with the launch of Seahorse, a community-led initiative. Seahorse enables developers to write Solana smart contracts in Python, which is arguably the world’s most popular programming language. The Solang launch is the continuation of efforts to broaden the reach and appeal of the Solana ecosystem among developers. The Solang compiler introduces an array of new features, chief among which are better compatibility with Ethereum Solidity version 0.8 and the integration of Solana SPL tokens with the Solidity language. Additionally, it also grants EVM frameworks on Solana access to the network’s built-in functionality. Other important highlights of the new Solang compiler include the ability to call other Solana smart contracts, support for program-derived addresses, enabling development with Anchor, and native Solana smart contracts. Solana Labs has also created a beginners guide to assist developers in leveraging their existing knowledge in Solidity and tapping into Solana’s high-speed and low-cost network. Using the guide, developers can easily set up their development environment, create and test their first smart contract, and then deploy it on Solana. Development on the Solana network has typically been around programming languages such as Rust or C, used to script smart contracts. Growing Efforts To Improve Ethereum-Solana Compatibility Solang’s launch, coupled with Neon EVM’s release, highlights the growing and continuous efforts to improve compatibility between the Solana network and Ethereum. Like Solang, Neon EVM’s computing environment allows developers to write and create Ethereum applications on top of Solana. The implementation utilizes a smart contract built on top of Solana and deploys the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) code, which was not previously possible on the network. Apart from providing access to the Solana network, Neon EVM also looks to help Ethereum applications to take advantage of functionalities that are native to Solana, such as parallel execution of transactions. At the time of its launch, the director of the Neon Foundation, Marina Guryeva, had stated, “We are very excited to see Neon EVM live on Solana Mainnet. Once we repeat these tests in production, we will present the figures based on real-world data.” Solana’s Foray Into AI Solana had recently made a significant announcement, officially integrating a ChatGPT plugin developed by Solana Labs and marking the official integration of AI into the network. AI has seen significant interest from big and small players in the crypto space. The Solana Foundation revealed that the integration would help users interact with the Solana network directly through ChatGPT. “This integration from Solana Labs serves as a reference for how AI can make it easier to understand Solana data and protocols or surface data about Solana’s computing infrastructure and DeFi projects.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

UNIBOT tokens have risen over 54% over the past week, and the team has reported a steady spike in user growth, according to Dune Analytics data.  Data shows Unibot users have traded $54 million worth of tokens using the application, with the platform distributing nearly $1 million in revenue back to users. These rewards are proportional to the number of tokens held with holders receiving 40% of transaction fees and 1% of UNIBOT's total trading volume.  The appeal for such products is likely due to the ease of usage compared to a decentralized exchange, such as Uniswap, where users have to continually log in to their wallet, cross-check if all token information is correct, and encounter high fees to ensure their trades go through.  “Main problem w/ trading on-chain is terrible UX, unibot allows you to easily market buy/sell w/ 1 telegram command,” writes popular Crypto Twitter trader @blknoiz06. “Trading directly through telegram is great for fast swaps, scalps, etc,” explains @0xKawz, another trader.  Meanwhile, newer tokens such as Wagiebot (WAGIEBOT), 0xSniper (0XS), Bridge (BRIDGE) and Bolt (BOLT) have jumped as much as 500% in the past 24 hours as traders look to capitalize on these tokens emulating Unibot’s growth.

The spot-ETF fever has gripped the crypto market in recent weeks, thanks to filings by BlackRock (BLK), Fidelity and others.  “The brand recognition of BlackRock and the iShares franchise, familiarity with purchase and sale methods through securities brokers, and simplicity of position reporting, risk measurement, and tax reporting, a spot ETF could bring some noted benefits compared to existing alternatives,” NYDIG writes in its report.  Already, NYDIG has modeled that there are $28.8 billion in bitcoin assets under management with $27.6 billion in spot-like products.  Bitcoin is often called digital gold, so there are bound to be comparisons to gold ETFs listed in the early 2000s. Currently, gold ETFs hold only 1.6% of the total global gold supply, NYDIG points out, compared to central banks at 17.1%, while bitcoin funds hold 4.9% of the total bitcoin supply.  There’s a massive gulf in demand for the digital and analog version of the asset in funds: there’s over $210 billion invested in gold funds while only $28.8 billion in bitcoin funds.  “Bitcoin is about 3.6x more volatile than gold, meaning that on a volatility equivalent basis, investors would require 3.6x less bitcoin than gold on a dollar basis to get as much risk exposure. Still, that would result in nearly $30B of incremental demand for a bitcoin ETF,” NYDIG writes.  The newsletter Ecoinometrics has a more cautious take on a bitcoin ETF.  GLD ETF filled a significant void in the market, Ecoinometrics writes, providing an easily tradable product that tracked the price of physical gold.  However, comparisons between gold ETFs and bitcoin ETFs are potentially misleading as the significant rise of gold during that time was largely due to a favorable macro environment and a weakening dollar. Remember the war on terror, China’s rise, and the beginning of a ballooning U.S. deficit all packed into a decade?  ""So while the GLD ETF definitely didn’t hurt and probably brought some nice inflow to the gold market, macro was really in the driver’s seat over that period,"" they write. ""A spot Bitcoin ETF can help with drumming up more interest into Bitcoin and will undoubtedly attract some fresh money into the space. But that won’t make one Bitcoin worth $100k single-handedly.""  The real potential for a Bitcoin ETF lies in a convergence of factors: the launch of the ETF, a weaker US dollar, a Federal Reserve move towards Quantitative Easing, and a generational wealth transfer to younger individuals more likely to invest in crypto, they write.

42393043,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgF4Sz,1689831533,XRP Moving Above 'Cloud' Resistance Is Bullish Precedent for Bitcoin: Analyst,"Payments-focused XRP has set a bullish precedent for market leader bitcoin (BTC) with a move above key price resistance that has opened doors for a sustained rally.  XRP surged nearly 60% last week, registering its best performance since August 2021. The rally saw prices move convincingly above a technical analysis indicator called ""Ichimoku cloud"" on the weekly chart, confirming a bullish breakout.  Bitcoin (BTC) is yet to achieve that feat.  ""We view [XRP's] cloud breakout as a good example for bitcoin,"" founder and managing partner at Fairlead Strategies said in a note to clients.  The Ichimoku Cloud, a technical analysis indicator created by Japanese journalist Goichi Hosoda in the late 1960s, is widely used by traders and analysts to identify support and resistance levels and gauge trend changes. The indicator comprises five lines based on the price's moving averages: Leading Span A, Leading Span B, Conversion Line or Tenkan-Sen (T), Base Line or Kijun-Sen (K) and a lagging closing price line. The spread between the Leading Span A and the leading Span B represents the cloud.  Crossovers above or below the cloud are widely taken to represent bullish or bearish trend change.  XRP has established a foothold above the Ichimoku cloud, while bitcoin remains locked in a narrow range below the cloud resistance (upper end).The token's breakout follows a year-long consolidation or basing pattern and suggests more gains ahead.  ""The move is meaningful on the chart because it resolves a year-long basing process higher. Intermediate-term momentum is positive and there are (surprisingly) no signs of upside exhaustion, supporting upside follow-through, with next resistance near $0.92,"" Stockton noted.  A similar bullish outlook awaits bitcoin on the higher side of the Ichimoku cloud, with the next resistance level at $31,900.

Blockchain-based payment platform Stellar Lumens' XLM was recently trading above 15 cents, up 18% over the past 24 hours. The token last hit those lofty heights a week ago when it doubled in price, part of a crypto market surge that followed Ripple's partial victory in a long-running legal feud with the Securities and Exchange Commission, before sinking in the ensuing days. At the start of the week, XLM was trading just above 13 cents.  Ripple's XRP, the third largest crypto by market capitalization, was recently changing hands above 82 cents, up 6.8% from Tuesday, same time. XRP has held most of its gains since last Thursday. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets performance, was recently trading up 0.5%  Markus Levin, co-founder of XYO Network, attributed XRP's Wednesday spike to continued excitement about last week's U.S. federal court decision, which established that XRP token sales on exchanges and through algorithms did not constitute investment contracts. The ruling has spurred a number of exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken and Bitstamp to relist XRP, leading to a jump in investments, trading volumes and open interest for futures contracts.  ""In short, we’re seeing a return of investors that had previously been spooked by recent regulatory measures,"" Levin wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  ADA and SOL, the native cryptos of smart contracts platforms Cardano and Solana, rose over 6% at certain points, far outstripping bitcoin and ether, which slogged through another dispiriting day of little price movement. Bitcoin was recently trading at $28,877, roughly flat over the previous day. Ether had edged down the better part of a percentage point to trade just below $1,900.  Equity markets inched upward for a third consecutive day as investors continued their embrace of encouraging second quarter earnings by major financial services firms even after a 58% plunge in Goldman Sachs profits. The S&P 500 closed up 0.2%.  In an email to CoinDesk, Lex Sokolin, managing Partner of Web3 investment fund Generative Ventures, wrote that markets' lethargy in recent days reflects their cyclical nature. There's often ""run-ups in anticipation and in response to news, and then a sell-off once the positive news has been incorporated into the price,"" Sokolin wrote. Crypto is full of momentum and narrative traders, and this pattern persists — ""the market animal spirits.""  Noting multiple market friendly events in recent weeks, including the XRP decision, an improving macroeconomic landscape and BlackRock spot bitcoin ETF filing, he added: ""Actually what matters is just the possibility of support.""

But the ruling failed to clarify fundamental issues that would allow Ripple and other crypto organizations with tokens to operate on more solid ground, Preston Byrne, a partner at the law firm Brown Rudnick, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover program on Wednesday.  Byrne said the ruling had surprised some lawyers by veering from more than 70 years of precedent following the Howey decision, which determines whether a transaction is a security. Regulators have wrestled with if and how the so-called Howey test should apply to digital assets.  ""The problem isn't that the decision provides certainty for Ripple in this particular litigation,"" Byrne said. ""The reason there's uncertainty is because this court has now ruled differently than everyone expected it to, based on 70-80 years of precedent.""  Byrne added: ""So as a consequence, you can't be sure where you stand in the United States. Some issuers are going to make the decision to proceed where perhaps they shouldn't, and other companies that might wish to proceed, if they had a beter regulatory regime – for example, in the United Kingdom or Europe, which provide a degree of certainty over regulatory treatment of tokens – may not so.""  The U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York ruled that the sale of Ripple’s XRP tokens on exchanges and through algorithms did not constitute investment contracts. But the court decided less favorably to Ripple that the institutional sale of the tokens violated federal securities laws.  Byrne said that ""crypto isn't a security in the traditional sense,"" noting its ""self-sovereign nature,"" and that ""people spend it in applications which provide useful software."" And he suggested that the U.S. Congress should create regulation that considers these unique characteristics.  ""We need a legal regime that recognizes that, while also providing enhanced protections for investors, such as regulation of financial promotions and disclosures by issuers, without shoehorning it (crypto) into a securities regime,"" Byrne said.  He continued: ""We need a regime which is make for crypto.""  Important events.  EthCC (Paris, France)  9:30 a.m.HKT/SGT(1:30 UTC) Australia Unemployment Rate s.a.
