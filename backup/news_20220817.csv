42422510,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0m3Th,1660779637,Solana’s Biggest DeFi Lender Is Leaning Into 'Permissionless' Loan Markets,"Solend is giving the same “permissionless” principles underpinning decentralized exchanges’ limitless token listings a try on Solana Network’s cryptocurrency lending market.  The biggest decentralized finance (DeFi) lender on Solana is letting anyone with 100 SLND (around a $70 fee) and some assets to spare spin up their own “permissionless pools” for lending those cryptos out.  Permissionless pools are troves of user-loaned crypto assets that help keep DeFi moving. Though widespread as liquidity sources for decentralized exchanges, they're less common in lending circles. Only a handful of lending protocols on the market leader Ethereum blockchain use them, and none on Solana.  Already Solend’s 21 whitelisted lending pools supply Solana’s DeFi markets with $471 million in borrowable tokens such as SOL, USDC and wrapped assets like wBTC. Its team vetted those permissioned pools to weed out the inevitable scammers; if something goes wrong, Solend’s treasury insurance fund will back up platform users.  Permissionless pools have none of those safeguards. That’s by design.  “Make sure you trust the pool creator,” Solend’s main Twitter account warned prospective depositors and borrowers on Wednesday.  Free-for-all pools could get wild in a hurry. Data oracles could show faulty prices, deposited assets could have malicious tokenomics, liquidation mechanics could sour and liquidity could dry up, according to the project. It's up to the pool creators (who take 20% of the fees borrowers pay) to set it up correctly, Solend says.  In an interview with CoinDesk Tuesday, core contributor Rooter said users need to do their own research on pool creators before jumping in.  Still, project contributors view the move as essential in pursuing true DeFi. If the team always decides what is and isn’t lendable, then how decentralized can Solend be? “One of the core tenets of DeFi is permissionless,” pseudonymous contributor Soju told CoinDesk in a Discord message.  Solend has grappled with DeFi’s core tenets before. When its single-largest lender nearly got liquidated by June’s crypto market rout, a series of messy governance proposals elicited widespread criticism. Solend soldiered through and remains one of Solana’s top DeFi protocols.  Read more: Solana’s Biggest DeFi Lender Almost Got Rekt. Then Binance Stepped In  In a blog post, Solend’s team said its pools could help projects “bootstrap” lending markets for their native tokens, help influencers “monetize their following” by promoting use of their own asset pool and even support the creation of “unsecured” lines of credit where borrows ride on reputation alone.  Opening the floodgates on lending pools could push more value and users into Solend, Matty Taylor, the head of growth for Solana Labs, told CoinDesk in a Twitter message.  “The big idea is that no asset should just be sitting doing nothing. Currently, a lot of the world's assets are just sitting around, not working to create value. Assets of all kinds could be utilized in a permissionless pool and be generating value for people.”",POSITIVE,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | MINING | SOL | TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/08/17/solanas-biggest-defi-lender-is-leaning-into-permissionless-loan-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ecb36dfeb66213b0eea4d9f27e62810f3bd663cb-2971x2228.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411403,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNYJG,1660774844,'Don't Say Terra' and Other Reflections From Korea's Crypto Extravaganza,"“Don’t say Terra.” Sometimes explicit, sometimes not – the message was clear.  Earlier this month, the who’s who of South Korea’s crypto scene descended upon hotel ballrooms in Seoul’s ritzy Gangnam district. They were there to attend a string of conferences meant to showcase Asia’s budding crypto ecosystem.  Terra, which was founded in South Korea, was one of the most talked about projects in the crypto-verse until it crashed last spring. It was, in many ways, the match that burnt down the entire crypto market – setting off a ripple effect that brought everything, including bitcoin and ether, down to the lowest prices they had seen in over a year.  The largest event in Seoul this month, Korea Blockchain Week (KBW), counted many of Terra’s original builders, investors and partners among its 7,000 attendees. KBW could have been an ideal forum to discuss the ills and excesses that culminated in the project's unprecedented rise and fall.  Read more: The Fall of Terra: A Timeline of the Meteoric Rise and Crash of UST and LUNA  Instead, any reflection on Terra – whose controversial tactics continue to run rampant throughout decentralized finance (DeFi) – was conspicuously missing from the KBW agenda. In place of Terra-centered soul-searching were humdrum discussions around GameFi, NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and the future of DeFi. The one-time Korean DeFi darling – ever the elephant in the room – was taboo.  Altogether, the events in Seoul left the impression of an image-conscious industry reluctant to learn from its mistakes or wade into controversy.  What was Terra?  The Terra fiasco, wherein a $40 billion dollar ecosystem collapsed to nearly nothing, continues to cast a shadow over the South Korean crypto scene which birthed and incubated it.  At the core of Terra was UST – a decentralized stablecoin that sought to maintain its $1 peg through clever programming rather than through direct 1:1 backing. The vision was ambitious. And it worked well until it didn’t.  The company that launched Terra, Terraform Labs, sold its vision of a decentralized dollar to legions of retail investors – many of whom lost big when UST (and its sister token, Luna) fell precipitously to zero in May.  For months before the crash, onlookers warned that UST’s stabilizing mechanism, which was supposed to expand and contract the supply of luna to keep UST at $1, was destined to fail just like virtually all similar experiments preceding it.  Suffice to say, the project was risky. And yet, Terra founder Do Kwon and many of his investors were adamant that UST was a safe investment.  Terra played a major role in growing South Korea’s nascent crypto scene. Many of the builders and retail investors who I spoke to in Korea cited Terra – sometimes with an embarrassed chuckle – as their first door into the sector. And I received pitch after pitch from projects that were forced to move to X or Y blockchain after originally building on the ill-fated “Terra Classic” blockchain.  The Terra taboo  Several of the most prominent companies and investors behind the events in Seoul – like KBW co-hosts Hashed and Klaytn – were major Terra partners.  Hashed, a Seoul-based investment firm with a cut-throat reputation in Korea’s crypto scene, suffered from the Terra fiasco just like everyone else did. One of Terra’s largest investors, the firm reportedly lost $3.5 billion from the project’s implosion.  Read more: Hashed Wallet Takes $3.5B Hit, Delphi Digital Discloses Loss After Terra's LUNA Collapse  But Terra skeptics have long maintained that Hashed bears some blame for propping up the project’s fragile ecosystem.  Terra’s underlying mechanism was criticized right from the start, but Terraform Labs and its brash founder didn’t want you to believe the haters. They bred a cult-like community that ostracized critics for circulating “FUD,” or “fear, uncertainty and doubt.”  Responding to one critic in July 2021, for example, Kwon tweeted, “I don’t debate the poors.” His response was cheered on by some of Terra’s loyal fans, self-dubbed “lunatics.”  Outside of its propaganda machine, Terraform Labs lured buyers into the Terra ecosystem through generous incentive programs subsidized, in part, by investor money. If the money behind those incentives were to dry up, critics feared that demand for Terra’s UST and Luna tokens would drop enough to break the mechanism that keeps UST “pegged” to one dollar. (In reality, the UST mechanism fell apart long before Terraform Labs ran out of reward runway.)  According to a recent Korean media report, Hashed joined in on the promotion frenzy: Top brass from the firm attacked critics who called out Terra’s mechanics, and the fund issued biased forecasting reports depicting the project in a favorable light.  Hashed’s investments in Terraform Labs also, of course, played a key role in helping the Terra ship set sail.  Has Hashed learned any lessons from investing in a project that reportedly wiped billions of dollars from its balance sheets? Don’t ask Hashed.  At KBW, Hashed refused to speak to CoinDesk about Terra – its best-known investment. The venture firm, which is the largest blockchain-focused fund in South Korea, indicated through its PR reps that it preferred to speak about its newer bets – a preference also reflected in the conference’s Terra-free programming.  Learning from the best  Terra had a massive presence in South Korea’s crypto scene before its collapse, but any reference to the failed project was scrubbed from Korea Blockchain Week and the conferences surrounding it.  During Buidl Asia, one of the conferences that preceded KBW, I was at a lunch with a some of the event’s speakers, including Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s co-founder. I mentioned that organizers warned me not to say the word “Terra” during a panel I moderated on stablecoins. (We said it anyway.)  Buterin remarked that he, too, had been advised not to mention Korea’s crypto boogeyman. Buterin is a Jesus-like figure in crypto-land, with his tweets and blog posts heralded as scripture in the Ethereum community.  He couldn’t say “Terra” either?  How a risky bet like Terra grew into a DeFi behemoth despite its glaring flaws remains a subject of inquiry among crypto skeptics and adherents alike.  But rather than ask hard questions around how to prevent the next $40 billion blowup, speakers in Seoul – many of whom, like Hashed, were deeply involved in the project – seemed to act as if the largest crypto crash in history had never occurred.  One of the KBW panels best-suited to address the Terra question could have been the one entitled “Next Generation of Finance on Blockchain.” But as an expert on how DeFi could grow sustainably, KBW chose a curious spokesman: Dylan Macalinao, a co-founder of the blockchain company Saber.  Just a few days earlier, Macalinao and his brother, Ian, were exposed by CoinDesk for using around a dozen pseudonyms to artificially inflate the size of Solana’s decentralized-finance ecosystem. The Saber exposé was still the talk of crypto Twitter by the time of Macalinao’s panel, but, as CoinDesk’s Sam Reynolds observed, the panel didn't make a single reference to the Macalinaos’ exploits – which included promoting projects without disclosing that they were secretly their own.  By completely avoiding the Saber controversy (let alone Terra), the panel – like the rest of the conference – felt more like an advertisement than a source of insight. It also left one with the impression that the crypto community continues to worship the wrong idols.  Terra? Hardly knew her…  Talk of Terra wasn’t on the official agenda in Korea, but it spilled out into hallways, cocktail hours and afterparties.  Everyone seemed to have some link to the project.  I spoke to Terraform Labs employees-turned-critics about how they had been temporarily banned from leaving the country by Korean prosecutors.  I met with an executive at the South Korean gaming company Com2Us, who explained that the company built out entire in-game economies on Terra before UST and Luna crashed, forcing the company to build out its own chain.  I also bumped into an employee from Chai, the Do Kwon-founded payment platform that was initially supposed to provide a use case for the UST stablecoin. Chai eventually spun away from Terra, and the employee I met said the company had pivoted focus to blockchain-based gaming.  The official panels at Korea Blockchain Week might have avoided criticizing Terra, but in one-on-one conversations, the knives were out.  Comments ranged from speculation around the psychological profile of Do Kwon to conspiracy theories around whether the Terra crash was an inside job.  Read more: ‘Down Infinite’: A Ham-Fisted Attempt to Rehabilitate Do Kwon’s Image  The sense of betrayal was palpable. And yet, all of these people showed up to a conference planned by Terra’s partners – seemingly unfazed by the conference’s rosy depiction of the broader crypto industry.  If anything was clear in South Korea, it was that crypto has a short-term memory problem.  Just as Terra’s largest investors seem to have forgotten the role that they played in history’s biggest crypto crash, Terra’s born-again critics are all too willing to brush over the fact that they, in many cases, also bought into the Terra myth – only to turn around later and say it was clearly a house of cards.  Perhaps it is unrealistic to expect Terra’s big money backers to publicly examine their role in promoting the project, particularly while it is under investigation. Nevertheless, the wider crypto community – especially the more informed builders and investors who bought into Terra while aware of its flaws – should cultivate spaces for dialogue that are willing to explore projects through a more critical lens.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | LUNC,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/08/17/dont-say-terra-and-other-reflections-from-koreas-crypto-extravaganza,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b93db34707ac718d319a66da01b8b8c81eb60823-2621x1966.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421833,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwANZ,1660771772,Nifty Gateway NFT Marketplace: A Beginner’s Guide,"There are several digital marketplaces where users can buy and sell non-fungible tokens (NFTs). One popular option is Nifty Gateway, which was founded in 2018 by brothers Duncan and Griffin Cock Foster with the mission to make NFTs “accessible to everyone.” It was acquired by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss’ cryptocurrency exchange Gemini in late 2019.  Like NFT marketplace SuperRare, Nifty Gateway is known for emphasizing high-end digital art and curated collections. The platform regularly offers limited-edition collections through partnerships with top artists and brands, including Beeple, Daniel Arsham and Pak.  While other Ethereum blockchain-based marketplaces such as OpenSea and Rarible continue to dominate the market, Nifty Gateway’s extensive collection of curated digital art and its unique custodial option offer a different experience for NFT collectors.  What makes Nifty Gateway different?  Nifty Gateway offers several services that differentiate it from other NFT marketplaces.  Custodial system  One of Nifty Gateway’s biggest points of difference is that it offers a custodial option. Crypto custody is a term used to describe who is responsible for keeping digital assets secured. You most often see that term linked to crypto wallets, which can be custodial or non-custodial. With NFTs, Nifty Gateway serves as a third-party custodian of NFTs bought and sold on its platform.  NFTs stored on the platform use Gemini’s custody product, which holds digital assets in a secure offline system known as “cold storage.” Nifty Gateway uses an ""omnibus wallet,"" or a master holding account, to move NFTs around the platform without having to process a transaction on the blockchain. This option means that there are no gas fees, which are typically required for any transaction on the Ethereum blockchain, including the transfer of an NFT.  Notably, this option also means that Nifty Gateway can step in to help if users lose access to their account or password.  Credit card payments  The custodial option on Nifty Gateway allows traders to use various payment methods to pay for an NFT, including debit or credit cards, prepaid ETH deposited into a platform-linked wallet or crypto funds from a Gemini account.  Wallet 2 Wallet (w2w)  Nifty Gateway also offers a non-custodial option for NFT sales called Wallet 2 Wallet (w2w), which allows users to buy and sell NFTs in ether (ETH) directly from their external crypto wallets. Because w2w transactions occur on the blockchain, gas fees are incurred, although Nifty Gateway’s custom smart contract makes NFT transactions more efficient, reducing the cost of gas fees by up to 70%.  As of August 2022, the feature allows users to create a w2w listing only for an NFT that is held in an Ethereum wallet, and users can purchase w2w listings only with ETH held in a MetaMask wallet. About one in five listings on the site are w2w.  No gas fees when minting  Nifty Gateway also covers 100% of the gas fees during the minting of an NFT on its platform at no cost to the collector.  Collectors will be responsible for gas fees only when they withdraw prepaid ETH, withdraw an NFT through payment options like Google Pay and Apple, or purchase an NFT with prepaid ETH and deposit NFTs into Nifty Gateway.  In addition, the company's latest update will cut its marketplace fee for listings from 5% to 2.5%, which is the same amount that competitors like OpenSea and Rarible charge. SuperRare has a 3% fee.  The platform says that users will never pay a fee to delist an NFT.  Curated and verified drops  Nifty Gateway requires new NFT releases to be reviewed and verified before being sold.  Curated Drops are selected by Nifty Gateway and sold directly by the creator exclusively on the platform. Verified Drops are drops across the NFT ecosystem that Nifty Gateway verifies to be authentic. Those drops are listed on the site as a calendar with the date and time of each drop flagged in advance.  The platform also has a secondary marketplace where users can purchase popular collections that it has verified like Bored Ape Yacht Club and World of Women.  Read more: Minting Your First NFT: A Beginner’s Guide to Creating an NFT  How to use Nifty Gateway  Nifty Gateway offers both a web and mobile app version of its platform.  To start, users will be prompted to sign up by creating a custodial account using an email address or by connecting to a wallet address through MetaMask.  Buying NFTs on Nifty Gateway  Once connected, users can set their payment methods. Under the top righthand menu, users can then click on ""Account Settings"" and then ""Payment Methods"" to link funds to their account.  Users have the option of paying for NFTs by linking a credit or debit card, using the balance on their Gemini account or depositing ETH directly from a MetaMask wallet into a prepaid ETH wallet address secured by the platform.  After users set their payment preferences, they can browse Nifty Gateway’s primary marketplace of Curated Drops or Verified Drops. Drops can be listed in several ways, depending on the creator’s preference, and include Open Editions, Packs, Auctions and more. On the Marketplace tab, users can find collections that have been verified by the Nifty Gateway team and are reselling on the secondary market.  Selling NFTs on Nifty Gateway  To put up an NFT for sale, users can either list their NFTs in ETH directly from their MetaMask wallet or sell NFTs for U.S. dollars by registering as an authorized seller.  To sell an NFT for ETH using the w2w option, users can go to their profiles and select an NFT they would like to list by clicking “List for Sale.” Note: Users must approve the transfer from their wallet to Nifty Gateway’s exchange wallet, and users will need to pay gas fees when they approve the exchange.  To sell NFTs for U.S. dollars, users can authorize their account through Stripe. Users will be taken to the Stripe site, where they will be prompted to connect either their bank account or debit card to receive a payout.  Artists and creators of an NFT collection will need to register with Nifty Gateway to list their NFTs exclusively on the platform.  Is Nifty Gateway safe?  Nifty Gateway is a popular choice for users looking to buy and sell exclusive NFTs that are verified and curated by the Nifty Gateway platform. Because Nifty Gateway is owned by Gemini, the service benefits from the cryptocurrency exchange's tools and security methods.  Still, the site isn't impervious to hacks. In March 2021, a small number of users on the site reported that their NFTs had gone missing from their Nifty Gateway accounts. The platform said that those compromised accounts didn't have two-factor authentication and that the website itself hadn't been breached. Some users said that Nifty Gateway was able to return their stolen assets.  Overall, Nifty Gateway offers a unique custodial option and curated NFT collections that make it attractive for users looking to buy and sell exclusive art collections.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Griffin Mcshane,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/nifty-gateway-nft-marketplace-a-beginners-guide,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d5724f5c2de3b028f5337a8233ebf02e666b0409-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has dropped 6% since crossing $25,000 briefly on Aug. 14.  Ether’s (ETH) price also tumbled for a fourth consecutive day, dropping 1.2% over the past 24 hours. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization behind bitcoin is now down 8% from the psychologically important $2,000 level it last cracked on Aug. 15. Ether has flirted with $2,000 for much of the past week after dropping below $1,000 earlier this summer.  This article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price declines in both assets occurred on normal daily volume compared to their 20-day moving averages.  Traditional markets were mixed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), tech-heavy Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 were down 0.5%, 1.3% and 0.7%, respectively.  Month-over-month U.S. retail sales were flat for July, while the consensus of analyst estimates was for a 0.1% gain. The unexpectedly sluggish spending in July occurred despite a better-than-expected inflation report on Aug. 10.  Commodities were mixed. The price of crude oil rose by 0.9%, natural gas prices contracted 1.44%, while gold, the traditional safe-haven asset, declined 0.63% in price.  Among altcoins, EOS increased 13%. while AVAX and MATIC dropped 4% and 4.3%, respectively.

Technical Take  BTC continues to sell off on overbought RSI readings (hourly chart)  BTC’s hourly chart implies that traders are reacting to both overbought and oversold readings of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator.  Following a 1% increase at 10:00 UTC, BTC declined 2.6% on higher-than-average volume an hour later. The decline followed a 67.1 RSI reading, just shy of 70.  The RSI is a widely used crypto market indicator that measures price momentum. A reading of 70 implies that an asset is overbought (i.e., overvalued), while a reading of 30 implies that an asset is oversold.  Over the last 10 trading days, there have been approximately eight instances where BTC’s hourly RSI has surpassed the current level of 67. The price of BTC, 12 hours following those oversold readings, declined seven out of eight times by an average of close to 1.3%.  Conversely, when RSI readings surpassed the oversold benchmark, prices were 5.4% higher, 12 hours later. Since declining to an RSI reading of 31.34 at 18:00 (UTC), BTC prices have increased 0.36%.  Although widely regarded, the RSI should not be viewed in isolation as a way to enter and exit the crypto market. It can, however, provide insight into price behavior, momentum and perceived price extremes.  Binance CEO weighs in on current state of crypto markets  Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume, discussed crypto’s outlook during CNN’s weekly ”Markets Now” show.  “We’re seeing stabilization. I wouldn’t say [the crypto winter] is completely over or not, that’s very hard for me to define,” Zhao said. “Bitcoin’s peak was around $68,000. Today it’s still at $23K so it’s bounced off from the bottom a little bit, but I’m not sure it’s the bottom bottom.”  Zhao said the main thing the crypto market needs now is time.  “When markets drop sharply, it does take a while to recover,” Zhao said. “Now we’re seeing some really positive news – the BlackRocks [referring to asset managers such as BlackRock] are getting into the industry so institutions are still coming in. We have seen a comeback from the retail side as well … And there’s a lot of new innovation.”  Zhao believes the cryptocurrency industry is fine and that price fluctuations are to be expected, but he doesn’t “see bitcoin going back to $68K in a hurry.”  “Going back up will always take some time, but the industry historically does go through four-year cycles so in a few years, most likely, there’ll be another cycle up.” Zhao said.  On-Chain Data  Despite the decline, derivatives markets are showing positive sentiment  Derivatives markets have turned slightly bullish of late, as funding rates for BTC have moved into positive territory again.  Funding rates represent payments to traders who are long or short a particular asset. When rates are positive, traders who wish to establish long positions are willing to pay traders who hold short positions.  The reverse is the case when funding rates are negative. The extent to which rates are positive or negative are used as an indicator of market sentiment.  In the current case, funding rates turned positive on Aug. 16, after being negative in the two days prior, implying a potential shift to bullish sentiment.  Fed Minutes Show Further Rate Hikes Ahead, Slower Hikes Eventually  By Helene Braun  U.S. central bank governors anticipate further interest rate increases in the upcoming months, but the pace of rate hikes will likely slow once they see a significant impact of the Federal Reserve’s policy making on inflation, minutes released Wednesday from last month’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting show.  “As the stance of monetary policy tightened further, it likely would become appropriate at some point to slow the pace of policy rate increases while assessing the effects of cumulative policy adjustments on economic activity and inflation,” the minutes said.  The FOMC boosted the interest rate by a robust 75 basis points in July, part of an ongoing hawkish, monetary campaign to tame inflation, which has hit four-decade highs in recent months. The committee, which meets regularly to set U.S. monetary policy, is widely expected to increase the rate similarly at its September meeting.  Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrency prices changed little following the release of the minutes. The largest crypto by market cap was trading 0.4% higher in the 30 minutes post release but was down about 1% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has declined for four consecutive days to lose ground it gained after rallying last week.  According to the minutes, the Fed will continue to hike rates until inflation lowers to 2%. “...It likely would be appropriate to maintain that level for some time to ensure that inflation was firmly on a path back to 2%,” the minutes said.  The U.S. central bank has raised interest rates four times this year, including 75 basis points – a historically large increase – at its last two meetings.

42422515,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0m3dh,1660768287,EOS Network Foundation Members Switch Support to Crypto Protocol Antelope After Hard Fork,"The EOS Network Foundation (ENF) said Wednesday that Antelope will be used as the underlying protocol for EOSIO-based blockchains. Antelope, a community-run blockchain protocol, will be supported by members of the ENF, which include EOS, Telos, Wax, and UX Network.  According to Zack Gall, vice president of communications at the ENF, the hard fork of the code of the EOSIO blockchain is slated for Sept. 21, which is when the official switch over to Antelope will take place. Because this is a hard fork, all member computers, or nodes, will have to upgrade in order to continue to run on the new protocol.  EOSIO in jeopardy  This all comes as ENF has decided to pursue legal action against Block.one, the entity that originally designed the EOS network, over malpractice concerns. In 2021, Block.one stopped supporting EOISO development, putting the blockchain in jeopardy. ENF thus started to develop initiatives during the fall of 2021 to explore the possibilities of coordinating EOSIO-based blockchains and to preserve and advance the codebase they share.  The ENF organized to fork the EOSIO code base to initiate a project labeled “Mandel.” Mandel was handed over to EOSIO developers to work on technical improvements and formalize a consensus upgrade. Mandel came to be a placeholder for the yet-to-be-decided brand to replace EOSIO. When the ENF introduced Antelope as this project, it retired Mandel.  Gall told CoinDesk, “The code was already forked back in February by the ENF and we've already added many new features and capabilities to that code, which today became known as Antelope.” He added that “the code has been running on testnets for a while” in advance of the hard fork next month.  The use of Antelope as the underlying blockchain is significant, since support for EOSIO (EOS) was discontinued by Block.one. Antelope will thus be taking charge of rejuvenating the community.  What is Antelope?  Antelope is an open framework blockchain and a community-run codebase. It uses a Delegated Proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus model, which evolved from proof-of-stake, where users of the network vote and elect delegates to validate the next block. Under DPoS, delegates are referred to as block producers.  Developers use Antelope for a diverse range of applications, from decentralized finance (DeFi) and supply chain management to non-fungible tokens (NFT) and games. The Antelope Coalition has already made Requests for Proposals, including proposals addressing faster finality, software development kits (SKDs), and peer-to-peer code improvements.  In a press release, Yves La Rose, CEO and executive director of the EOS Network Foundation, said, “We are building upon over four years of battle-hardened code, and the cumulative knowledge of four [layer 1 blockchains] leveraging each other’s strengths, all united behind the Antelope protocol.”  The price of EOS, the native cryptocurrency of the EOSIO blockchain, had risen nearly 20% over the past 24 hours to $1.65 before dropping down to $1.49 at time of publication.

42421853,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwA73,1660763513,Are Blockchain Bridges Safe? Why Bridges Are Targets of Hacks,"In March 2022, over $625 million worth of cryptocurrencies were stolen from the Ronin Bridge protocol as a result of a malicious attack from hackers, marking the event as one of the biggest cryptocurrency heists ever. In June, Harmony One’s Horizon Bridge lost over $100 million in an attack. In August, another $200 million was lost from the Nomad Bridge as a consequence of an exploit of a vulnerability in its underlying technology — smart contracts.  In total, Chainalysis estimates that over $2 billion worth of digital assets have been stolen from blockchain bridges in 2022 alone. This figure accounts for approximately 69% of all stolen crypto funds in the year.  The frequency of these bridge hacks has become a warning signal for users and a significant threat to building trust in blockchain technology. As adoption of cryptocurrency accelerates, the industry is facing growing pressure to fix the flaws that have allowed these exploits.  In this article, we’ll look at why blockchain bridges have become an essential part of the crypto ecosystem, the difference between trust-based and trustless bridges, and the potential weaknesses in each model that enabled hackers to siphon funds in each one.  What are blockchain bridges?  Blockchain bridges, also known as network bridges or cross-chain bridges, are a tool designed to solve the challenge of interoperability between blockchains. Bridges have become a necessary component of the blockchain industry because, as it stands, blockchains operate in silos and cannot communicate with one another.  For example, users cannot use bitcoin (BTC) on the Ethereum blockchain or ether (ETH) on the Bitcoin blockchain. So if one user (let’s call him Billy) who holds all his funds in BTC wants to pay another user (let’s call her Ethel) for an item but Ethel only accepts ETH, Billy hits a wall. He can’t send BTC directly to Ethel. He can take extra steps to buy ETH or trade a portion of his BTC for ETH, but BTC cannot be sent directly to Ethel. This can be seen as a major disadvantage in comparison to fiat currencies and credit cards, which can be used across several providers.  Blockchain bridges aim to eliminate this issue.  While each blockchain bridge is designed differently, these bridges typically allow users to lock in a certain amount of digital assets on one blockchain. In exchange, the protocol will then credit or mint the same amount of assets on another blockchain, equivalent to the funds that are locked in.  These new assets are known as “wrapped” versions of a token. For example, a user who locks in their ether (ETH) on one blockchain will receive a “wrapped” ether (wETH) on another blockchain. This allows Billy to use a bridge to send wrapped bitcoin (wBTC), which works on the Ethereum blockchain, to Ethel in a more seamless fashion.  See also: What Are Wrapped Tokens?  Trust-based vs. trustless blockchain bridges  From a security viewpoint, bridges can be classified into two main groups: trusted (also known as custodial) and trustless (noncustodial). Trusted platforms are essentially platforms that rely on third parties to validate transactions while acting as custodians of the bridged assets. For example, all wrapped bitcoin is held in custody by BitGo. Having one company control all of an asset means it is a single point of failure. If the company is corrupt, goes bankrupt or has other fundamental problems, the crypto that it has in custody is at risk.  To illustrate, the Ronin Bridge protocol relied on nine validators — four of which were held by the Sky Mavis team. To maintain its security, the Ronin Bridge requires the majority of these validator nodes (five or more nodes) to initiate any withdrawal or deposit. However, because the attackers were able to compromise all four nodes the Sky Mavis team controlled, they only needed a single additional node to take control. They did this and it allowed them to drain the protocol of $625 million under the cover of a “verified” withdrawal.  Other examples of trust-based bridges include Binance Bridge, Polygon POS Bridge, Avalanche Bridge, Harmony Bridge and Terra Shuttle Bridge.  On the other hand, platforms that rely purely on smart contracts and algorithms to store custody assets are referred to as trustless bridges. Its limitations lie with the integrity of its underlying code.  For instance, Wormhole is a platform that facilitates cross-bridge transactions between Solana and Ethereum. Wormhole is a blockchain bridge protocol that suffered an exploit in February 2022 due to a bug in the smart contract. This allowed the attackers to bypass its verification processes and resulted in a hack worth over $326 million.  Other examples of trustless bridges are Rainbow Bridge, Polkadot’s Snowbridge and Cosmos IBC.  Are blockchain bridges safe?  Both trusted and trustless approaches can have fundamental or technical weaknesses. To be more precise, the centralization aspect of a trusted bridge presents a fundamental flaw, and trustless bridges are vulnerable to exploits that stem from the software and the underlying code. Simply, if there is a flaw in the smart contract, it is almost certain that parties with malicious intentions will attempt to exploit it.  Unfortunately, there hasn’t been a perfect solution to the conundrum the industry faces. Both trusted and trustless platforms have implicit flaws in their design and compromise the security of the blockchain bridge in their respective ways.  In addition, as the value and users of the cryptocurrency industry keep increasing, hackers are getting more sophisticated. Traditional cyberattacks like social engineering and phishing attacks have also adapted to the Web3 narrative to target both centralized and decentralized protocols.  Although not foolproof, a valuable first step towards addressing the security issues on blockchain bridges can be an extremely rigorous source code audit before deploying the bridge on the blockchain. This must be a ground-up check to minimize any flaws whatsoever, because all it takes is one slip up with a bad line of code and hackers have a way in.  Due to that, it is vital for users to do their due diligence before interacting with any bridging ecosystem, which includes checking the documentation, the code and the maturity of the system. This is a means of protecting their crypto while the developers find a solution to overcome the limitations of current blockchain bridging protocols.

42411406,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNYWU,1660761359,"In Crypto, Base Layer Security Isn’t Enough","Earlier this week a new type of stablecoin (aUSD), built on a platform (Acala), which itself was built on a blockchain (Polkadot), fell from its $1 peg to $0.009 (which rounds to zero as far as I’m concerned), following an attack on one of the platform’s liquidity pools. If the words following “attack on” seem to be oddly specific, that’s because they are.  Acala wasn't attacked, hacked and thwarted directly. Rather, the iBTC/aUSD liquidity pool, something built on top of Acala, was attacked, hacked and thwarted directly. The exploit was successful and allowed bad actors to create billions of aUSD for themselves. This influx of new aUSD crushed the price of the stablecoin strictly through immense supply dilution.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  aUSD has since recovered, but only after the Acala community voted to destroy the billions of the improperly minted aUSD. Never mind that the minted aUSD wasn’t really improperly minted and never mind the need for a centralizing force to come in to fix this mistake, let’s instead look at how cryptocurrency protocols are only as secure as what’s built on top of them.  Move fast and break everything  aUSD isn’t the first crypto thing that has been broken or hacked (e.g. Ronin for $625 million and Wormhole for $326 million) – it’s just the flavor of the week. But we should be clear here: aUSD didn’t necessarily stop working, and the attackers didn’t rappel into a building to physically break into the mainframe or something.  Instead, aUSD worked as designed. Buggy code governed the liquidity pool, and that buggy code allowed attackers to print billions of aUSD.  This is the same as the two other examples provided – with each CoinDesk article accurately using the term “exploit” to describe the attacks. We should do the same here, because exploit, rather than hack, more accurately defines taking advantage of poorly constructed code.  Exploits, of course, aren’t isolated to protocols you’ve never heard of. Acala is built on Polkadot, for instance. Sure, Polkadot’s native currency DOT is the 11th-most valuable cryptocurrency, but it’s not like Polkadot is Ethereum. Except Ethereum did have an exploit in 2016 – colloquially called The DAO Attack – which led to a messy chain split (look up Ethereum Classic) and a loss of credibility.  This is good ammo for the boomer Bitcoin developers who are hellbent on changing absolutely nothing about Bitcoin because they’re afraid that would break the protocol. I’m not coming here in defense of halting new development of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency protocols, but rather, I simply want to provide some color as a warning given how easy it is to draw a parallel to Silicon Valley tech companies and crypto.  The ethos of Silicon Valley tech is (was?) to “move fast and break things,” but the stakes are simply higher for crypto. If a developer at Salesforce introduces a bug that hurts a customer’s experience, patching that bug really comes only at the expense of time to fix the mistake (maybe there’s a reputational hit, but a company can get through a few mistakes a year with no issue).  See also: Calling a Hack an Exploit Minimizes Human Error | The Node  Not so in crypto. If a bug is introduced to a crypto protocol through a new shiny product or layer or smart contract or whatever and is eventually exploited, the damage could spread far and wide and could be irreversible. Things should be built on crypto protocols and the protocols themselves should be upgraded, but that should be done with care.  All said, the main point is: It’s fine to move fast and break everything, unless you don’t want to break everything.",NEGATIVE,BTC | DOT,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | DOT | ETC | FORKS,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/08/17/in-crypto-base-layer-security-isnt-enough,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/72068473e3c90bb46db445c0855938cc6191c0b5-7072x5304.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Researchers at the University of Technology Sydney estimate that insider trading, or front-running, occurred on 10% to 25% of new crypto listings at Coinbase between September 2018 and May 2022, generating at least $1.5 million in profits for whomever was behind the transactions.  A giant like Coinbase listing a token can give cachet and dramatically boost liquidity for a token, causing its price to rise. Someone could – illegally – profit from that by purchasing a cryptocurrency before its listing is made public.  Read more: BlackRock to Offer Crypto for Institutional Investors Through Coinbase Prime  And, indeed, there have already been allegations of insider trading at Coinbase. In July, the U.S. Department of Justice charged a former Coinbase product manager, his brother and their friend with wire fraud and insider trading. The trio were accused in that case, which revolved around tokens including TRIBE and ALCX, of making $1.5 million illicitly.  The new study – which has not yet been peer reviewed – suggests the problem was broader than what emerged in that case, though, because the researchers said they found instances of insider trading that go beyond the scope of the July allegations.  “Our analysis shows significant price run-ups before official listing announcements, similar to prosecuted cases of insider trading in stock markets,” according to the paper written by Ester Félez-Viñas, Luke Johnson and Tālis J. Putniņš. “These findings point to cryptocurrency markets being susceptible to the same forms of misconduct that regulators have for a long time grappled with in traditional financial markets.”  Read more: Ex-Coinbase Product Manager Pleads Not Guilty in Crypto Insider Trading Case: Report  A Coinbase spokesperson responded to the study in a statement: “Coinbase takes allegations of front-running incredibly seriously and we work hard to ensure all market participants have access to the same information. As part of this effort, we have taken steps to minimize the possibility of technical signals during asset testing and integration steps. We have zero tolerance for illicit behavior and monitor for it, conducting investigations where appropriate.”  The study notes the date Sept. 25, 2018, when Coinbase updated its listing process to rapidly list new assets, as CoinDesk reported at the time.  The researchers said they found at least four crypto wallets involved in suspicious trading. The behavior, repeated over and over, involved these wallets buying tokens in the hours before Coinbase announced it was going to list them.

42422512,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0m3Zh,1660757992,Why Bitcoin Traders Should Care About Double-Digit Inflation in UK,"The cost of living in the U.K. surged to 10.1% in July, a government report showed Wednesday, providing the first instance of double-digit inflation in a major economy post-COVID-19 and presenting a fresh sign of price pressures spreading around the world.  The report could bring more urgency to economic discussions among crypto analysts, because inflation has underpinned a key bitcoin (BTC) market narrative for the past couple years.  John Silvia, a former chief economist for Wells Fargo who founded Dynamic Economic Strategy, said that faster inflation in the U.K. could exacerbate price pressures elsewhere, including in the U.S.  “There is a tussle between expectations of Federal Reserve and Bank of England policy,” he said.  The Bank of England has raised rates six times this year. August’s 50 basis point hike was the biggest increase since 1995. The U.K. central bank may raise interest rates faster as inflation is expected to hit 13% later this year, according to the bank’s own forecast.  Faster rate hikes by the BOE could increase demand for fixed-income investments in the U.K., which in turn could drive demand for the British pound, strengthening its value in foreign-exchange markets.  The flip side is that the U.S. dollar will be weaker by comparison, and so U.S. consumers may end up paying more for imports in dollar terms, which could add to domestic inflation. If the Fed were then forced to respond with more aggressive rate hikes, markets for risky assets would likely come under pressure.  Crypto assets are seen as one of the riskiest asset classes, and bitcoin traders have paid close attention to the inflation dynamics since at least early 2020.  Bitcoin was seen as a hedge against inflation because of its its preprogrammed pace of issuance under the original blockchain code. But in practice, actual reports of inflation have prompted central banks to slow down or reverse money printing and tighten monetary conditions to keep economies from running too hot, and that has put downward pressure on prices for risky assets, from stocks to cryptocurrencies.  “After the U.S. consumer price index came in a bit lower, the British pound appreciated in value,” Silvia said. “With the latest U.K. inflation, the pound may appreciate a bit more, especially if the Federal Reserve only raises the funds rate 50 basis points in September.” (A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.)  Interest rates in the U.K. are now at 1.75%, but traders are expecting borrowing costs to rise above 2% by year end and to exceed 2.6% by the end of 2023.  The U.S. federal-funds rate is at 2.25%, but markets have started pricing in less aggressive rate hikes in upcoming months. Minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee meeting in July, scheduled for release at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday, could give markets more clarity on that.  While inflation in the U.K. is still on the rise, the U.S. economy has seen some relief, with the latest CPI showing signs of a slowdown in the rate of rising prices. The question is whether price increases are truly abating or whether the latest figure was a temporary reprieve. Another possibility is that prices will stay elevated around the current level.  “The rise in services inflation this year is a clear sign of inflation broadening and becoming self-reinforcing, and it’s been a pattern shared in both economies in the context of tight labor markets,” said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings.  “This is arguably the segment of the CPI basket that the BOE has most control over, and it is way too high and still rising,” he said. “The recent U.S. CPI print showed a similar pattern.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/08/17/why-bitcoin-traders-should-care-about-double-digit-inflation-in-uk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7520850641ce2e7aceb77510028c0c9728fbf2c0-3923x2943.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While everybody knows that working out is good for them, doing so can be daunting and frustrating. One of the fascinating methods of trying to entice people to get fit is through move-to-earn programs. These projects incentivize people to work out by paying them to do so. Move-to-earn projects have existed for some time, but recently, they have seen tremendous growth. One of the catalysts for this is the enormous success that StepN has seen, which is a Web3-focused move-to-earn service that has been building hype across the tech and fitness sectors.

Building Trust Between Parties In the past, many companies designed a myriad of products to incentivize people to exercise, but ultimately none of them caught on. This was mainly because there was a chasm of trust between participants and companies. In addition, people were skeptical about whether they would receive their funds in exchange for working out, so it became tough for many move-to-earn programs to take off and build traction.

42422504,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0m3Lh,1660753072,"Ukraine Bought Weapons, Drones With Crypto Donations","Ukraine’s government bought weapons, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, better known as drones) and digital rifle scopes, besides non-lethal tools, with some of the $60 million in crypto donated after Russia invaded the European nation earlier this year, an official revealed in a new breakdown of expenditures.  Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine’s minister for Digital Transformation, tweeted the breakdown on Wednesday, which revealed the government had used some of the $54 million worth of funds raised via crypto to purchase lethal weapons and launch an English news platform. Another $6 million has yet to be spent.  Ukraine’s donation website acknowledges the drone and lethal weapon purchases, although the displayed figures differ from Fedorov’s calculation.  ""We (the Digital Ministry) converted crypto and sen[t] it to our Defence Ministry. They decided that they need something (lethal weapons). We are at war and we can defend ourselves with every mean possible,” Deputy Minister Alex Bornyakov said on being asked about the earlier statement that they would only buy non-lethal weapons through crypto donations.  Russia invaded Ukraine in February, prompting the country to launch multiple donation drives in an effort to beef up its defenses and equipment using crypto in an unprecedented way.  The breakdown also confirmed what government officials had previously told CoinDesk about using crypto donations to buy drones, medical kits for soldiers and thermal imagers.  Bornyakov told CoinDesk that more than $5 million spent on “weapons requested by the Ministry of Defence” were “lethal weapons.”  “We don’t want to inform Russia which lethal weapons we are buying,” Bornyakov said.  Bornyakov said the lethal weapons were “defense weapons, not offensive ones,” but on being asked what are “defense weapons” he said “no comment.”  “Our commitment to transparency and accountability allow people who donated crypto see exactly how their donations have been distributed. In order to prevent the occupants from tracking efforts, we have decided not to reveal some sensitive information until we have won the war,” he added.  It’s a sharp contrast to Ukraine’s original breakdown of how it spent its funds; officials had initially stated that it was using the crypto funds only to buy non-lethal equipment.  Dyma Budorin, CEO of Ukrainian startup Hacken, said the use of crypto to buy lethal weapons is “sensitive.” Hacken provides cyber security to crypto exchanges and has a collection of ""hacktivists"" attacking Russian institutions.  “If the fund is using crypto to buy lethal arms it should be clearly stated from day zero because this is very sensitive and people should know it,” Budorin said.  Patreon, a subscription platform for artists and creatives, has previously removed the Ukrainian non-profit “Come Back Alive” for using contributions to finance and train military personnel, a violation of the platform’s policy that doesn't allow it to be used for funding weapons or military activity.  The breakdown was also published by Minister Mykhailo Fedorov with the goal of increasing transparency and inspiring confidence in donors, an early commitment by the Ministry.  The spending accounts for $54 million out of the current $60 million raised by the Crypto Fund of Ukraine, while the remaining funds are still being spent, Bornyakov said.  “We aren’t going to give a list of every single thing we bought, but this is a start. We are still continuing to purchase night vision goggles and bulletproof vests. But we have started spending more on fighting the propaganda. This is new. We have also started spending on new Ukrainian media, United24, an English news platform,” Bornyakov told CoinDesk in a recent interview.  Top expense: UAVs  Ukraine bought 213 UAVs, spending $11,887,936. This made drones the biggest spending category.  The next four categories include about $7 million spent on 8,460 armored vests, $5.7 million spent on five computer hardware and software packages, $5 million spent on a worldwide anti-war media campaign and another $5 million spent on an unknown quantity of weapons requested by the Ministry of Defense.  Bulk purchases  Field rations account for the highest category in terms of quantity. The country bought a total of 416,900 field rations through crypto donations.  Bornyakov has also previously said that “the crypto fund is being used to purchase non-lethal equipment for military purposes such as bulletproof vests, night vision goggles, military-grade food rations and medical equipment that helps with hemostasis such as tourniquets.”  The other major expenses in terms of quantity were medical. A total of 105,831 medicines and 31,065 military medical kits have been bought.  Ukraine has also bought close to 80,000 items of military clothing and accessories (79,369). This does not include 8,460 armor vests or 5,061 digital rifle scopes.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Loses Ground While Dogecoin Metrics Soar At the time of writing, the crypto total market cap stands at $1.09 trillion with a 2% loss in the 4-hour chart. The sector was rejected at the $1.2 trillion resistance and seems on track to slate more losses in the short term. Analyst Justin Bennett believes the sector could trend lower if it breaks below support at $760 billion. As seen below, the crypto total market cap has been moving in a channel for over 4 years. Every time the total market cap touches the top of this channel, cryptocurrencies trend lower. At the time of writing, the sector is a major crossroads and could attempt to re-test support at around $300 billion if downside pressure extends. The analyst said: Is another 65% drop in the cards for crypto? Don&apos;t rule it out. $760B will continue to be significant for TOTAL. But if that breaks, a retest of this multi-year channel at $370B seems likely. There are several factors that could contribute to selling pressure across multiple timeframes.

According to CoinMarketCap, as of today, there are a total of 20,575 cryptocurrencies in existence. This culminates in the current market cap of $1.147 trillion and a trading volume of $77 billion in the last 24 hours. All these figures show you how big of an industry the crypto market is. And because of this, there are many guidelines and steps users need to always follow. Plenty of ins and outs to navigate and log out of and many efforts required to keep track of wallets, credentials and keys. Apart from cryptocurrencies and tokens, there are thousands of softwares and applications on the internet. Brilliant creations like these by developers have unintentionally created a chaotic experience for both users and developers. As a result of this, there&apos;s not so much order, ease and trust going around in the crypto app space. This is fast becoming a problem, especially for newbies to the space.

Worthington says Coinbase’s market share is probably tilted toward institutions, which are more likely to own ETH and bitcoin (BTC), whereas retail customers may “traffic more in the more speculative tokens.”  The bank further estimates that Coinbase can generate an incremental annual staking revenue of $650 million from the Merge, with ETH at $2,000 and a 5% yield. The exchange began offering Ethereum staking for institutional clients earlier this month.  “Coinbase is bigger in [ether] than was intuitive to us, thus leading directly to a bigger revenue opportunity,” the bank wrote.

Nexo asked the U.K. High Court to order Georgi Shulev to transfer nine crypto assets to the company, including bitcoin and ether. That was supposed to be a condition of a settlement agreement under which Shulev would receive $1 million. The lender claims that it has been locked out of trading platform BitMEX during a time when the value in cryptocurrencies declined, resulting in losses of $7.9 million.  The cryptocurrency market endured a significant downturn between November and July, with bitcoin tumbling from $69,000 to $17,500 while ether plunged from $4,850 to $875.  HDR Global, which is the parent company of BitMEX, asked the High Court to determine who owned the account after Shulev left as a director at Nexo in 2019. As a part of the agreement, Shulev and Nexo were supposed to inform HDR once Nexo gained control of the account; Nexo claims that Shulev is now refusing to do this.  For his part, Shulev claims that Nexo breached an agreement to transfer the first of five installment payments to him and as a result he can't inform HDR that the dispute has been resolved.  ""Nexo is entitled to and claims damages for the breach,"" to be converted to U.S. dollars, according to Nexo's claim.

While bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and futures tied to the S&P 500 are trading weak, the safe haven U.S. dollar is gaining against other global currencies.  Investors trimming bullish exposure to assets perceived as risky, amid expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve might use the minutes of its July meeting to push back against hopes of slower rate hikes and eventual liquidity easing.  Early this year, the Fed embarked on its most aggressive liquidity tightening cycle in over two decades, roiling bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The Fed will release the minutes of its July policy meeting on Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET (18:00 UTC).  ""The question is whether the Fed wants to use these minutes as a communication tool to push back against the view of a 2023 easing cycle,"" ING analysts noted in a market update published Tuesday. ""Post-meeting rhetoric from the Fed suggests that this is more likely to be the case – especially since the Fed funds futures price the policy rate being cut from 3.60% to 3.20% in the second half of next year.""  While the minutes are a raw record of what transpired at the last meeting, some observers argue they could be tailored to anchor market expectations.  ""Fed looks at market reaction post meeting and uses minutes to correct misunderstandings. There is a lot to correct today,"" Joseph Wang, former Fed trader, tweeted.  The Fed raised rates by 75 basis points to the 2.25%-2.5% range and ditched forward guidance, saying the next moves will be data-dependent. Since then, markets have been pricing slower rate hikes and eventual liquidity easing in 2023, tracking the decline in commodity prices. The dovish expectations strengthened last week after the U.S. reported softer-than-expected consumer price inflation for July.  However, markets appear to have run ahead of themselves, as the central bank's inflation fight is far from over, several Fed officials said following last week's CPI release. Policymakers added that interest rate hikes could continue into 2023.  Risk assets may see renewed volatility if the minutes further push back against the dovish expectations. ""A further rejection of this market pricing should help the dollar,"" ING analysts said. ""Favor DXY pushing up the 107.00 area."" The DXY, short for the U.S. Dollar Index, is currently around 106.70.  Bitcoin tends to move in the opposite direction of the dollar index.

42413276,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8HnU,1660743718,EU Lawmakers Seek to Cap Banks’ Bitcoin Holdings,"European Union (EU) banks that are exposed to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC) would face caps and hefty capital requirements under proposed amendments to a financial-services law published Wednesday.  The plans, tabled by Green Party lawmaker Ville Niinistö, seek to anticipate capital norms currently being consulted on by international standard-setters, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.  Under the plans, set out in a document dated Aug. 11, crypto assets like bitcoin, which are deemed unduly volatile or risky and known collectively as class 2, would have the most cautious possible rating. In effect, this means they will be unable to lend based on their virtual asset holdings.  “An institution’s total exposure to class 2 crypto-asset exposures must not be higher than 1% of the institution’s Tier 1 capital at all times,” said the proposal backed by the Finnish Member of the European Parliament, imposing an absolute limit on how much bitcoin regulated lenders can hold. Tier 1 capital represents the highest-quality capital in a bank's reserves.  Class 1 crypto assets, which are deemed less risky than class 2 and encompasses regulated stablecoins and securities that use distributed ledger technology, would get more flexible capital requirements and no cap.  Changes to EU bank capital law were originally proposed by the European Commission in October 2021, to implement international norms set by Basel in 2017. Standard setters want banks to issue enough financial instruments to ensure they can safely lend without having to call on taxpayers in the event of a 2008-style economic crisis.  The EU's original plan was to leave rules for banks' crypto holdings until 2025, but since then the bloc has agreed on its Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA) to govern stablecoins, and a further law to enable Web3 securities trades on a trial basis.  The Basel Committee has also set out draft plans to regulate banks’ crypto holdings, which closely resemble Niinistö’s but are still under consultation.

The fund debuted on the same day as a $300 million purse from CoinFund, dual signs that investors remain confident during the crypto bear market.  “There's been crypto funds that have grown and ballooned in size to billions of dollars of assets under management,"" founder and managing partner Yida Gao told CoinDesk in an interview. ""It’s hard for them to invest in the earliest stages of Web3 founders ... We think that's an area that we can add the most value.”  Shima Capital Fund I will focus on pre-seed and seed stage investments. More than half of the Shima team is devoted to post-investment operational support services such as engineer recruiting, community marketing and token design, said Gao.  The fund has a generalist approach that covers a wide range of potential verticals from consumer companies addressing decentralized identity or Web3 social media to gaming to next-generation blockchain technology like zero knowledge rollups, which address Ethereum’s high transaction fees and slow throughput. Check sizes will range from $500,000 to $2 million for each company.  “We want to have that margin of safety in our investments,” explained Gao. “Investing early and helping the companies with their entire lifecycle of growth allows us to have that margin of safety and have higher, risk-adjusted returns for our limited partners.”  Investors in the new fund included newly rebranded VC firm Dragonfly, hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman, blockchain game maker and investment firm Animoca, crypto wallet OKX, Mirana Ventures, Republic Capital, CoinDesk parent Digital Currency Group and entrepreneur and former U.S. presidential candidate Andrew Yang, among others.  Shima Capital was founded in 2021 by Gao, who previously co-founded crypto hedge fund Divergence Digital Currency. His work history also includes stints as a technology investor at New Enterprise Associates, a venture capital firm with more than $25 billion in assets under management, and as M&A-focused investment banker at Morgan Stanley.  How did Shima Capital feel about launching its first fund during a market downturn?  “Launching the fund in the bear market is great,"" said Gao. ""We can support founders at the earliest stages and have the capital they need across all the stages and help them raise additional capital ...

This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price point  Both bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) were trading down on Wednesday, as U.S. stock-index futures fell.  U.K. inflation topped 10% last month to its highest in 40 years, underlying a gloomy outlook for Europe. Rising energy costs are likely to push European inflation rates higher even as U.S. inflation shows signs of slowing.  Altcoins showing strength included tezos (XTZ), which was up 6% over the last 24 hours and tokenized sports exchange Chilliz' CHZ token was up 4.2% and unus sed leo (LEO), Bitfinex’s exchange token, was also up around 4%.

Ether keeps outperforming the rest of the crypto market as traders appear bullish on the network’s upcoming transition to proof-of-stake. The cryptocurrency is trading up 20% on the month.  A report from FSInsight said that ether has a good chance of exceeding bitcoin in market cap over the next 12 months because the Ethereum blockchain’s switch to a proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism will reduce both the production of the tokens and selling pressure from miners.  Ethereum’s market share has increased from a bottom of 14.3% in mid-June to 20.1%. Bitcoin’s market share went from 47.5% to 40.1% during the same period, suggesting traders are favoring ether over bitcoin currently.  The small cap index is the best performer with an 8% increase, whilst large and mid caps increased 6% and bitcoin saw the lowest gains at 3%.  Arcane Research notes that Ethereum is also stealing market share from other smart contract platforms in terms of total value locked (TVL) on DeFi applications. Currently 59% of TVL in DeFi is on Ethereum.     Chart of the Day  Bitcoin Under Pressure as US Bond Yield Ends Two-Month Downtrend  By Omkar Godbole  The yield on the U.S. 10-year note jumped to 2.9%, ending the two-month downtrend.  The breakout suggests the crypto market may be wrong in predicting that inflation has peaked and the Fed would slow rate hikes.  Analysts at ING foresee renewed tightening of financial conditions – uptick in the dollar index and bond yields – in the coming weeks.  The Fed may use minutes of the July meeting, scheduled for release later Wednesday, to push back against hopes of a 2023 easing cycle.

Genesis – owned by Digital Currency Group (DCG), which is also the parent of CoinDesk – filed a $1.2 billion claim against failed crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital in July. DCG assumed that claim and associated liabilities from Genesis last month.  The New York-based broker was one of several companies impacted by the crypto market downturn in May. The implosion of LUNA and the Terra ecosystem, followed by the demise of crypto lender Celsius Network as well as the collapse of Three Arrows Capital, led to a slew of layoffs, bad debt and bankruptcy filings throughout the industry.  Current Chief Operating Officer Derar Islim, who joined Genesis in 2020, is replacing Moro on an interim basis as the company searches for a permanent replacement. Genesis has also brought on former SAC Capital and Point72 Asset Management President Tom Conheeney as a board member and senior adviser.  “The changes and investments we’re announcing today affirm our commitment to operational excellence as we continue to expand our services to meet the needs of our clients today and into the future,” Islim said in a statement.

White begins at Blackstone as a senior investment adviser, working on a flexible, part-time basis with the firm’s various investment teams, including consumer growth, private equity, alternative asset management and private credit – a roster that accounts for close to a trillion dollars. He will also be working with Blackstone’s portfolio companies to foster an understanding of crypto and Web3 investing.  “[Adam] will help us think critically about the broader ecosystem for digital assets, including the potential areas of disruption as blockchain technology is applied to new sectors. Few people better understand both the challenges and opportunities related to the industry,” said Vishal Amin, a managing director at Blackstone Growth.  White added, “I’m excited to join Blackstone as an adviser and work alongside the team and portfolio companies. The scale and operating resources Blackstone offers to companies is unmatched and can be particularly powerful in a growing industry.”  Following the pattern of many other financial giants, Blackstone has taken a cautious approach to crypto, preferring to invest in the sector's picks and shovels, including the likes of blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis.  White left Bakkt at the end of 2021 after three-plus years at the firm. Bakkt, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange, also the owner of NYSE, went public in October 2021 via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company.  Before joining Bakkt, White was a key member of the Coinbase executive team during the San Francisco-based exchange’s formative years between 2013 and 2018.

42422524,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0mA3h,1660738675,"Crypto Analysts Reject Latest DOGE, SHIB Rally as Contrarian Signal","Meme coins are rallying again, outperforming bitcoin and ether. While historically that has portended a market-wide price crash, analysts say this time it's different.  Dogecoin (DOGE), the biggest meme cryptocurrency by market cap, has gained 21% in the past seven days to trade near nine cents, the most since June 1. Shiba inu (SHIB), the self-proclaimed dogecoin killer, rallied more than 50%, hitting a three-month high of $0.00001700, according to CoinDesk data. Market leaders bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) have risen just 3% and 11%, respectively.  Some investors are concerned because meme token rallies have often proved to be contrary indicators, telling you to step away from the herd and lighten up on market-wide bullish exposure. After DOGE chalked up a triple-digit rally in April 2021, outshining bitcoin and ether, the crypto market valuation halved to $1.25 trillion in two months. Similarly, SHIB's late October-early November surge saw crypto market valuation peak above $3 trillion before tumbling back.  Pundits have criticized dogecoin and its peers for the lack of use cases. That may be why rallies in the tokens are taken to represent market froth indicating bull-market tops. One analogy would be how traditional market analysts see record-setting art auction prices as predictors of financial market bubbles and economic collapse.  However, the latest jump in meme tokens appears news-driven and doesn't represent a speculative frenzy, according to trader and analyst Alex Kruger.  ""Some crypto traders may be worrying about the end of this bull run as dog coins take off. Dog coins ramping up marked the end of the two 2021 bull runs,"" Kruger tweeted. ""However, dig in, and you'll notice this dog run just started and is news driven. The DOGE run in particular looks sound to me.""  Dogechain, an Ethereum-compatible smart contract network built using Polygon Edge, went live early this month and gained plenty of attention on social media. The community has billed the project as ""layer 2 for dogecoin,"" enabling the creation of decentralized applications and non-fungible tokens (NFT). So, at least in the eyes of the DOGE community, the token is now more than just a joke.  ""The surge of dogecoin can largely be attributed to the Dogechain announcement,"" Igneus Terrenus, spokesperson at crypto exchange Bybit, said. ""Sometimes a nine-figure VC check is less powerful an instrument for [a layer 1] than having the word 'doge' in your name.""  Terrenus added: ""Crypto is highly reliant on meme culture, and projects able to carve out a sizable share of attention often benefit from a price point of view.""  In any case, it may be too early to call the meme token rally a sign of speculative frenzy, considering DOGE and SHIB are still 80% below their highs. While bitcoin has gained over 30% in two months, even the market leader is down 65% from the record $69,000 reached in November. The market has been in a consistent downtrend since November, mainly due to U.S. Federal Reserve monetary tightening. It's unlikely traders are gambling money to make quick bucks out of cheap coins like SHIB and DOGE.  Matthew Dibb, chief operating officer and co-founder of Stack Funds, said it's common for alternative cryptocurrencies, including meme tokens, to rally on the coattails of ether.  The native token of Ethereum's blockchain has doubled to $2,000 in the past four weeks as developers announced mid-September as the tentative time for the long-awaited technological upgrade dubbed ""the Merge.""  ""Speculators will seek to rotate holdings into more risky tokens when the ETH price is strong,"" Dibb said. ""We're seeing an appetite for meme coins again and low liquidity 2017 era tokens such as EOS.""  Perhaps investors looking for clues on whether the market bounce is running out of steam should look at other factors.  ""Macro headwinds in terms of the Fed’s approach in taming inflation and supply chain issues, the Ethereum Merge and its attendant speculative trading, and the Mt. Gox bitcoin unlock remain the greater variables for the broader market than the largely harmless fun of memecoins such as DOGE,"" Bybit's Terrenus said.",NEUTRAL,BTC | DOGE | SHIB,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/08/17/crypto-analysts-reject-latest-doge-shib-rally-as-contrarian-signal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/057892391a95a5a26e82710f19b26a7341d32bc8-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42413940,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAnTeQ,1660737600,Crypto Investment Firm CoinFund Launches $300M Web3 Fund,"CoinFund, a crypto-specific investment firm, inaugurated a $300 million venture capital fund to back early-stage blockchain projects, a sign of investor confidence in an industry plagued by a bear market.  The CoinFund Ventures I fund will invest in companies showing commercial traction that also belong to a crypto sector with a large total addressable market, said David Pakman, CoinFund managing partner and venture investing head, in an interview with CoinDesk. Areas of interest include layer 1 blockchains, Web3 infrastructure, non-fungible tokens (NFT), gaming and asset management.  While the value of venture capital investments in the crypto industry fell 26% during the first half of 2022 compared with the same period last year, the number of deals remained solid, suggesting a shift toward earlier, smaller funding rounds. The new purse was announced a little over a year after the firm raised $83 million for its first venture capital vehicle.  Founded in 2015, CoinFund had previously focused on bitcoin (BTC) and seed stage investments in decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. Portfolio companies include NBA Top Shot creator Dapper Labs, blockchain infrastructure platform Blockdaemon and data indexing protocol The Graph. Successful portfolio companies moving on to raise Series A rounds expressed a desire to continue working with the firm, which lacked a vehicle to invest at that stage.  “We saw this hole in the market, sort of prodded by our CEOs,"" Pakman said. ""We felt we could be very effective and helpful at that stage, so we raised an early-stage fund.”  Check sizes for CoinFund Ventures I investments will range from $6 million to $10 million per company, meaning the fund will likely back 30 to 40 companies. The majority will go to companies CoinFund hasn’t backed before, but a small number of portfolio companies could receive follow-on investments, Pakman said.  CoinFund identified some of the limited partners backing the new fund such as private market investment firms Adams Street Partners and StepStone Group, fund of funds Accolade Partners and the Teachers Retirement System (TRS) of Texas. TRS became a member of the small but growing number of pension funds making crypto investments.  Pakman joined CoinFund last year after spending 13 years at traditional venture capital firm Venrock. Einar Braathen has now made the same leap from traditional to crypto-native deal flow, leaving technology firm Accel to focus on early-stage investments at CoinFund.  Asked about launching a fund during a bear market, Pakman noted that CoinFund has existed through three downturns and that the new fund has a six- to eight-year lifecycle.  “These kinds of market swings are sort of par for the course,” he said. “As long as you’re focused on building something important that will capture lots of value over time, the markets will cooperate at some point.”  Read more: CoinFund’s President Working on Assembling ‘Regulatory Legos’ for His Firms to Succeed",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/08/17/crypto-investment-firm-coinfund-launches-300m-web3-fund,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ea8ddfa7c4966786e949b0e524ce30fb0e91b638-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393797,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpB08T,1660735800,Tornado Cash Fallout: Can Ethereum Be Censored?,"With the sanctioning of Tornado Cash last week, the cryptoverse has been rife with speculation about how far protocols and companies will go to comply with government regulations.  Underneath this debate, a key question is being tested: Can Ethereum be censored? The answer isn’t as simple as “yes” or ”no,” and it requires differentiating Ethereum the protocol from the many apps and services built atop it.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Services can be censored. Ethereum infrastructure providers like Infura and Alchemy have already restricted access to data on Tornado Cash smart contracts. Circle, the company that powers the USDC stablecoin, has begun denying service to accounts that have interacted with Tornado-linked addresses.  But it’s not all doom and gloom. The Ethereum protocol – the technology dictating whether transactions get propagated out to the rest of the network – has (thus far) not been censored. If a U.S. citizen wants to shuffle money through Tornado Cash, miners will still add the transactions to blocks and propagate them out to the wider network.  Read more: Are Crypto Mixers Legal?  But as a series of Twitter think-threads have pointed out this week, this doesn’t mean that the protocol is completely immune.  Testing the limits of Tornado Cash  Whatever your opinion on the Tornado Cash debacle, the fact that so many companies have jumped to comply with the sanctions by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) should not be surprising. As CoinDesk’s Daniel Kuhn opined earlier this week, “It is perfectly reasonable, and possibly preferable, for Ethereum blockchain-based apps to block users with exposure to Tornado Cash, following the sanction of that anonymizing service last week. The alternative would likely open large parts of the Ethereum network to criminal liability. And that would include founding teams who are building the nascent, alternative economy of decentralized finance (DeFi).”  The founder of Tornado Cash has already been taken into federal custody. For Ethereum app builders and exchanges to flaunt sanctions on principle, they risk jeopardizing everything they’ve been building toward. At scale, this could imperil the entire ecosystem.  Industry think tank Coin Center has argued that the U.S. government’s dictate surrounding Tornado Cash is overbroad: “How can it be proper to add to the sanctions list not a person, or a person’s property, but instead an automated protocol not under anyone’s control?”  As Coin Center indicated, one could theoretically just clone Tornado Cash’s smart contracts (though this would still be extremely risky).  But this broadness applies in other ways.  In an act of protest (and comedy), Ethereum users have been testing how far the sanctions extend by sending money to public figures via Tornado Cash. Because Jimmy Fallon, for example, has received a bit of ETH from a Tornado address, he will presumably lose access to services that flag Tornado-linked wallets – all through no action on his part.  For the pranksters, this proves these sanctions were clumsily defined and therefore difficult to apply practically. But it also demonstrates how interpreting the sanctions requires one to get a bit technical.  Should a person lose access to apps even if they can’t actively “accept” a Tornado Cash transfer? What does it even mean to “use” Tornado Cash?  This is where things get interesting on a protocol level.  Read more: Decentralized Mixer Tornado Cash Makes Its User Interface Open-Source  Recall that the Ethereum network, like other blockchains, relies on a community of miners – or validators, in the upcoming proof-of-stake system – to assemble blocks and issue them out to the network. When you initiate a transaction on Ethereum as a user, it is added to the mempool – a big pile of transactions that have yet to get confirmed. Validators and miners assemble blocks by selecting transactions from the mempool and placing them in some order. They then propose those blocks to the broader network so they may be confirmed by others and added to the chain.  Now let’s look back at the Tornado Cash situation. If a validator adds a Tornado Cash transaction to a block, would they be running afoul of sanctions? While unlikely, the answer to this question isn’t so clear.  This has left room for speculation as to whether the Ethereum network is, at its very core, at risk of censorship. It has also kicked off a conversation on Twitter around how the Ethereum community would respond should validators take it upon themselves to no longer accept Tornado Cash transactions.  OFAC compliance in a ‘decentralized’ ecosystem  As we’ve discussed in past editions of this newsletter, centralization on Ethereum’s upcoming proof-of-stake (PoS) network is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore.  Twitter user elonyverse kicked off a debate Monday by predicting that over 66% of Beacon Chain validators – those who “stake” ether and operate the nodes that run Ethereum’s proof-of-state network – will adhere to OFAC regulations.  Thus far there’s no evidence from these validators that they will, indeed, censor transactions. It’s not even clear that governments would require them to do so. However, elonyverse’s tweet raises important questions about the influence that states could theoretically have over a blockchain the more centralized its validator set.  Jon Charbonneau, a research analyst at Delphi Digital, explained to CoinDesk that only one-third of validators would need to collude with one another in order to pose a nuisance to the network. If these many validators decide they don’t like Tornado Cash transactions, they could theoretically meddle with the network by preventing transactions from being finalized.  The validators would have even more sway over the network if they managed to amass 51% of staked ether. And should two-thirds of validators decide they want to completely censor certain transactions, Charbonneau says there’s not much that the rest of the network would be able to do in order to stop them, short of forking to a new blockchain.  The censors can wait  There hasn’t been any indication as yet from validators (or miners) indicating that they’ve altered their activity pursuant with the U.S. Treasury’s Tornado Cash mandate. Moreover, it’s not clear that validators would censor the chain even if required.  Lido – the largest Ethereum staking pool – divides its stake among several different validators. If Lido’s community decides sanctions bar them from processing Tornado Cash transactions, they’d need to get all of their validators on board or find new ones.  Luke Youngblood, who founded the Polkadot-based Moonwell protocol after previously helping to build Coinbase’s Ethereum staking product, told CoinDesk he thinks it is incredibly unlikely that the validators staked by Coinbase would ever censor transactions.  For one thing, says Youngblood, all of Coinbase’s staking infrastructure was set up outside of the United States. Even if it wasn’t, Youngblood thinks the company would sooner shut down its staking service than censor transactions (and risk losing part of its staked ether as a penalty).  Charbonneau explained to CoinDesk that there are additional layers of nuance around whether validators are proposing or building a block.  Eventually, in order to tackle the so-called miner extractable value problem (MEV), Ethereum will separate the parties that build blocks from those who propose them out to the wider network. While full proposer-builder separation (PBS) seems like it may be a couple of years out, an interim feature called MEV-boost, which is set to accompany the Ethereum Merge in September, will allow validators to propose pre-built blocks from central “relayers” rather than build blocks themselves.  In messages with CoinDesk, Delphi General Counsel Gabriel Shapiro speculated that proposers and builders could possibly be viewed differently from a legal perspective.  “The legal conception of ‘facilitation’ or ‘aiding/abetting’ can be very broad,” Shapiro wrote in a message to CoinDesk. “Validators who do not propose a block containing a sanctioned [transaction], but nevertheless sign an attestation for that block as part of the sequence of events leading to that block becoming finalized, might be guilty of facilitating or aiding/abetting the sanctioned [transaction], and thus might be violating sanctions laws (or other laws, as applicable).”  The Ethereum community responds  Youngblood thinks this whole debate around whether validators will censor transactions is silly. “It's just good engagement farming to spread FUD [fear, uncertainty and doubt] about companies, whether true or not. It gets a lot of likes/retweets,” he wrote in a message to CoinDesk.  FUD or not, the risk of protocol-level censorship is being taken seriously on Twitter, where prominent crypto investor Eric Wall polled the Ethereum community on how it would respond should validators begin censoring transactions.  So far, 61% of users have selected Option X: “Consider the censorship an attack on Ethereum and burn their stake via social consensus.”  This would mean forking to a brand new blockchain, where the offending validator’s stake is eliminated or reduced.  Among the majority in favor of punishing censors was Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, tweeting simply: “fwiw I voted X in your above poll.”  Pulse check  The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum Beacon Chain over the past week.

DeFi platform Acala’s stablecoin came close to regaining its peg to the U.S. dollar.  WHY IT MATTERS: Polkadot-based decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Acala’s native stablecoin, aUSD, depegged on Sunday, falling 99% after hackers exploited a bug in a newly deployed liquidity pool to issue 1.28 billion tokens. In response, the platform burned over 1.2 billion aUSD tokens. Even though the price of aUSD plunged from roughly $1.03 per token to $0.009 after the attack, the peg was nearly regained Tuesday following the token burns, reaching 93 cents. Read more here.  Research firm FSInsight says ETH might eclipse BTC’s market capitalization in the next year.  WHY IT MATTERS: Ether (ETH) has a good chance of surpassing bitcoin (BTC) in market cap over the next 12 months because the Ethereum blockchain’s switch to proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism will reduce both the production of the tokens and selling pressure from miners, research firm FSInsight said. Bitcoin has a market cap of about $461 billion, CoinDesk data shows, compared with Ethereum’s $226 billion. Read more here.  Monero successfully completed a hard fork upgrade.

42422539,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0mARh,1660723686,Dogecoin Jumps as Dogechain Gains Traction Among Retail Crypto Traders,"Dogecoin's (DOGE) price has surged this week following retail interest in Polygon Edge-based network Dogechain, a bridge that allows traders to convert dogecoin to wDOGE and allows them to use tokens, non-fungible tokens (NFT) and products built on the network.  Dogechain is built on Polygon Edge, which lets the project bootstrap a new blockchain network while providing full compatibility with Ethereum smart contracts and transactions, according developer documents.  DOGE's price rose some 10% in the past 24 hours even as the broader crypto market remained largely flat. This added to a 25% increase over the past week, CoinGecko data shows, and is currently seeing resistance at the $0.088 price level.  Part of the price movement in dogecoin has arisen from user demand for DOGE tokens, which are used for bridging over to Dogechain. Dogechain – which touts itself as a layer 2 companion blockchain for dogecoin – uses dogecoin as the platform's base trading token and as payment for fees on its network.  Dogechain is also set to airdrop its own DC token to users of the platform, its site shows. “The Dogechain team is preparing to airdrop millions of DC tokens to the dogecoin community,” developers said.  Some Crypto Twitter users have speculated that users who bridge their dogecoin to Dogechain will be recipients of the airdrop. This has further increased short-term demand for dogecoin.  The Dogechain bridge is raking in money from retail traders betting on short-term price movements of the dog-themed tokens, many of which contain “doge” or “shib” in their names. Most of these tokens are speculative in nature, however, and do not showcase a legitimate use case.  Data from on-chain trackers shows some $4.6 million in value is now locked on Dogechain-based products since its launch earlier this week. Over 97% of that is locked on Dogechain-based exchange DogeSwap alone, the data shows.  Dogechain developers said Wednesday the network had seen over 480,000 unique transactions and some 58,000 native wallets since the network’s creation earlier this week.",POSITIVE,DOGE,BLOCKCHAIN | DOGE | MATIC | TRADING | AIRDROP,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/08/17/dogecoin-jumps-as-dogechain-gains-traction-among-retail-crypto-traders,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9999428392b8f346f480c2f5eeddea1df161a424-3410x2558.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411109,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giC9DE,1660723200,"UK Crypto Industry Welcomes New Stablecoin Rules, Awaits Guidance","Crypto advocates in the U.K. have largely welcomed a new bill that could bring digital assets like stablecoins into the scope of local payments regulation. But there’s uncertainty about how the new rules will look like, should the bill pass.  The bill is scheduled to be debated in Parliament for the first time in September. It will move through a complex legislative process that could be slowed further by the recent cabinet shuffle, and crypto advocates are awaiting indications from regulators on how they plan to interpret and enforce the rules.  “We will have to wait to see what new rules are introduced as a consequence of the bill to fully understand the new powers and approaches of the various regulators,” James Alleyne, legal counsel at the London-based law firm Kingsley Napley, who advises crypto firms on compliance, told CoinDesk in a statement.  The proposed stablecoin rules are part of a larger financial-services and markets bill that maps out the U.K.’s post-Brexit economic strategy. It looks to extend existing financial regulations to cover payments-focused cryptocurrencies such as stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies intended to maintain a peg to a fiat currency, usually the U.S. dollar.  Those cryptocurrencies are defined broadly as “digital settlement assets,” or DSAs. The bill also puts the U.K. Treasury in charge of defining what DSAs are and assigning the Bank of England (BoE), Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Payments Systems Regulator (PSR) various powers to enforce the rules.  Terra’s influence  The U.K. is the latest major country to propose legislation targeting stablecoins. It was influenced in no small part by the downfall of terraUSD – a stablecoin that rapidly lost its peg to the U.S. dollar in May and led to the collapse of a $40 billion enterprise. The U.S. and Singapore are also stitching together regulatory frameworks to rein in stablecoin issuers.  Read more: UK Markets Bill Extends Banking Rules to Crypto Assets  Meanwhile, policymakers in the European Union recently agreed on the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) bill that seeks to set up licensing rules for crypto firms and lay out stringent requirements for stablecoin issuers that wish to operate in the EU.  At least six industry experts told CoinDesk the U.K.’s proposed measures were a welcome step and align with the U.K.’s ambitions of becoming a global crypto hub.  “I see this as a key piece of legislation for financial services, which I hope can allow us to make the most of the opportunities of Brexit and to establish an approach to crypto regulation that is right for the U.K.,” said Lisa Cameron, a member of Parliament and chairwoman of the cross-party group for crypto.  “By bringing stablecoins within the scope of regulation, the bill paves the way for further adoption in the U.K., and this will be a key area of focus for parliamentarians as part of our inquiry into the wider sector,” she added.  Read more: UK Parliamentary Group Starts Crypto Inquiry to Form Policy Recommendations  Blair Halliday, managing director of the U.K. for Gemini, a crypto exchange and custodian, called the legislation a “positive move that recognizes the significant role that these assets will play in our economy and financial system in the future.”  Systemic stablecoin issuers  Much like the EU’s MiCA legislation, the U.K.’s proposed rules place a heavy emphasis on systemic stablecoins, a term used to describe stablecoins issued at a large enough scale to threaten financial stability should they fail.  But whereas MiCA sets standards that need to be met for stablecoin issuers to operate in the EU, the U.K. bill assumes stablecoin issuers have already become operational and seeks to give powers to regulators to identify and supervise DSA service providers that are at risk of failure or bankruptcy, according to Matthew Nyman, a lawyer who specializes in crypto and blockchain fields at the CMS law firm in London.  “[This bill] is looking at the worst-case scenario,” Nyman said, adding that the U.K. still has “zero explicit regulation” for cryptocurrencies and that the new bill doesn't clarify whether a DSA service provider is allowed to operate, indicate how that provider should operate or who needs to authorize it.  “You might be forgiven for thinking that if they've put something in place for what happens at the end … That means they've already worked out what happens at the beginning. But they're doing it the other way around,” Nyman said.  The focus on failing DSA service providers reinforces the overall messaging around the U.K. government’s post-Brexit economic strategy, as well as the positions of regulators in the U.S. and the EU on containing the risks of systemic stablecoin issuers.  The goal is to strengthen the U.K.’s position as a tech hub while “safely” adopting crypto assets, Nadhim Zahawi, the country’s new finance minister, said when he introduced the markets bill.  The U.K. government’s planned discussions on wider digital assets including bitcoin (BTC) for later this year will be crucial in understanding where it really stands on crypto-friendliness, Nyman said.  “That will be the key test of whether what the government departments and what the regulators are doing … actually match up with what the politicians are saying,” he said.  Nyman also said it’s still unclear what role each regulator will play in setting up everything that’s “missing,” including an authorization regime for DSA service providers.  “The BoE will need to authorize any stablecoin, and there are due processes that firms will need to follow before being given authorization,” the PSR told CoinDesk in an emailed statement.  The proposed rules indicate the BoE will have final say over stablecoin issuers that could threaten the U.K. financial system or the central bank’s ability to “act in its capacity as a monetary authority.”  The BoE will detail its plans to regulate systemic stablecoins, including whether it will be authorizing firms next year, in a consultation, where the government lays out proposed regulatory measures in a document and invites the public or industry representatives to weigh in. The PSR, too, is planning to issue guidance on how it would regulate DSAs, including stablecoins.  The FCA, which has already been authorizing crypto companies under the government’s anti-money laundering rules, will probably continue to focus on consumer protection, according to Alleyne, while the BoE is likely to focus on wider financial stability.  Delays  Political turbulence in the U.K. government may cause delays in the bill’s passing.  “Until we get a new [prime minister], Parliament is never going to pass anything of serious magnitude, so we're effectively on pause until then,” Ryan Shea, crypto economist at Trakx, a Paris-based crypto index platform with a U.K. presence, told CoinDesk in an interview.  Adam Jackson, director of policy at U.K.-based crypto lobby group Innovate Finance, is concerned that the bill won’t become law until next year and that regulators won’t announce new rules until 2024.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,"Camomile Shumba, Sandali Handagama",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/08/17/uk-crypto-industry-welcomes-new-stablecoin-rules-awaits-guidance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0ef74bed0ee999cf90f02452f29fe73ff70b143b-4667x3500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

But will this rally break the 200-day SMA to reach the $2 mark? Key Technical Points: The token price has increased 30% in the last two days. The bull run struggles to rise above the 200-day SMA due to higher price rejection at $1.70. With a market cap of $1.627 billion, the intraday trading volume of EOS has increased by 217% to reach $700 million. Past Performance of EOS As we mentioned in our previous analysis, the EOS price broke about the $1.40 resistance level resulting in an ascending triangle breakout. The triangle breakout comes after the bullish reversal from the support trendline accounting for a price jump of 30% over the last two days. Furthermore, the breakout rally extends about the $1.50 mark to challenge the overhead assistance of the 200-day SMA. Source - Tradingview EOS Technical Analysis The EOS price displays higher price rejection in the daily candle, reflecting the bullish struggle to sustain above the $1.60 mark. However, if the closing prices sustain above the $1.60 mark, the uptrend continuation will exceed the 200-day SMA. The increasing possibility of a bullish crossover between the 50 and 100-day SMA fuels the uptrend momentum.

Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) said Tuesday, citing communications he had received.  In a letter directed to Acting FDIC Director Martin Gruenberg, Toomey wrote that he had heard from ""affected parties"" and whistleblower communications that claimed the federal bank regulator had tried to ""deter banks from doing business with lawful cryptocurrency-related companies,"" even though providing services to these companies is not illegal. Toomey asked the regulator to confirm whether any FDIC official had indeed asked banks to not do business with crypto firms, and if so, to explain why.  American Banker first reported the letter on Tuesday.  Toomey referenced ""Operation Choke Point,"" a former FDIC and Department of Justice initiative whose stated purpose was to pressure banks not to provide services to payday lenders and financial fraud charges, but which appeared to also pressure banks not to provide services to companies engaging in legal activities like gun sellers.  ""According to whistleblower communications that we have corroborated, personnel in the FDIC’s Washington, D.C., headquarters are urging FDIC regional offices to send letters to multiple banks requesting that they refrain from expanding relationships with crypto-related companies, without providing any legal basis for sending such letters,"" Toomey wrote. ""...

In a statement, the FDIC said, ""The FDIC is acting consistent with longstanding legal authorities to ensure that banks engaging in crypto-related activities are doing so in a safe and sound way that protects consumers. This may involve the FDIC requesting that an institution delay initiating or refrain from expanding crypto-related activities until supervisory feedback is taken into account. Given the risks readily apparent in the crypto-asset markets, these are necessary and appropriate actions to take.""  The regulator has published statements before directing banks to be cautious about working with crypto companies.  In April, the FDIC published an open letter addressed to any banks or other institutions it oversees, directing them to contact the FDIC before it engages in ""a crypto-related activity."" The regulator said it would assess the information provided by the bank to check for ""safety and soundness,"" and provide feedback if needed.

Key Technical Points: The Tezos token price has increased 10% in the last two days. The bull run plans to exit the rising channel and reach the next milestone at $2.21. With a market cap of $1.81 billion, the intraday trading volume of Tezos has increased by 82.30% to reach $76.11 million. Past Performance of XTZ As we mentioned in our previous analysis, the Tezos (XTZ) price took a bullish reversal to challenge the resistance trendline of the rising channel.

1398568,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=498938,1660708817,XRP Price Could Rise If It Clears This Price Barrier,"XRP Price has witnessed consolidation between the $0.30 and $0.37 mark for a considerable number of trading sessions. Over the last 24 hours, the altcoin has managed to hover around the same price mark without losing its market value. In the past week, XRP price has lost 2% of its value. Lateral trading had caused buying strength of the coin to be be affected. For the bulls to take charge, it is important for XRP to break past its sideways trading. XRP had formed higher highs and higher lows at the end of July. The bulls don&apos;t seem to be able to push past the $0.37 mark. This could be pointed towards the lack of demand for XRP. The $0.37 mark has been a propelling point for the altcoin&apos;s price, however, the bulls could not hold on to the momentum even then. With Bitcoin receding on its chart, many altcoins have also followed the same sentiment on their respective charts. Demand and broader market strength remain crucial for XRP. XRP Price Analysis: Four Hour Chart The altcoin at the time of writing was trading for $0.37. XRP had witnessed sharp resistance at the $0.39 price ceiling. Incase XRP price manages to topple over the $0.39 level, there could be a possibility for a rally. Additional resistance mark for the coin was at $0.40. The local support for XRP rested at $0.34.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Bitcoin and Ether Fall, but Meme Coins Are Rallying  By James Rubin  Most major cryptos were on the defensive for a second consecutive day, with bitcoin and ether both trading slightly lower from respective two-plus-month highs they reached less than 48 hours ago.  BTC was recently changing hands below $24,000 after cracking $25,000 on Sunday and down roughly a percentage point over the past 24 hours. Ether was trading under $1,900 less than two days after breaching $2,000 for the first time since late May, as investors large and small paused from more recent risk-embracing postures.  ""The recent crypto rebound has hit a wall as retail traders continue to lick their wounds and institutions respect key technical levels,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange Oanda, wrote in an email. ""Bitcoin can’t yet break above the $25,000 level, but it seems to be maintaining a bullish trajectory here.""  Over the past seven days, ETH has outperformed BTC amid growing anticipation of the Merge, which will shift the Ethereum protocol from proof-of-work to a faster, more energy efficient proof-of-stake protocol. ETH’s total market capitalization is now 50% of BTC’s, approaching levels last seen in January. ETH’s market cap compared to BTC’s indicates the potential for a “flippening” event, where ETH’s total market cap exceeds BTC’s. In a report, FSInsight suggested that ether could approach bitcoin’s market cap over the next 12 months.  ""The upcoming merge has led to elevated trading activity for ETH, especially in the options market, where the open interest surpassed BTC’s for the first time in history,"" Arcane Research noted in a newsletter.  Other cryptos were mixed, with popular meme coins DOGE and SHIB continuing their recent surge and rising more than 13% and 3%, respectively. But MANA, YGG and SAND all recently fell more than 2.5%.  Futures tracking DOGE and SHIB recently had over $25 million in liquidations, data showed, suggesting part of the rally in them has stemmed from futures bets. But the two cryptos' gains have also been confounding.  Equities  Stocks were mixed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was slightly in the green after big box retailers Walmart (WMT) and Home Depot (HD) posted unexpectedly strong second-quarter earnings but the tech-focused Nasdaq down declined a fraction of a percentage point. The tech sector, which has largely correlated with crypto pricing, has been weathering disappointing results from major chip manufacturers.  Still, a 17-month low in housing starts offered investors the latest hopeful sign that the the U.S. economy was decelerating sufficiently for the Federal Reserve to scale back interest rate hikes at some point over the next six months. A decline in the July Consumer Price Index (CPI) last week suggested that the bank's recent monetary hawkishness was slowing inflation. Travis Kling, founder and chief investment officer for Ikigai Asset Management, told ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV that these signs could ""bode well for asset prices broadly and for crypto as well.""  Crypto news  The fallout from the terraUSD (UST) stablecoin collapse and wide-spreading price declines has slowed this month but is far from over. In an announcement on its website, cryptocurrency lending platform Hodlnaut said it had filed an application with the Singapore High Court to be put under judicial management, which is a form of protection from creditors. The application was filed on Aug. 13, five days after the company froze withdrawals, and will temporarily safeguard the lender from any legal claims.  Hodlnaut is the latest in a long line of crypto companies that have been stung by the recent market downturn, Singapore-based exchange Zipmex received creditor protection on Monday, while trading firm Three Arrows Capital owes billions of dollars to creditors after imploding in June due to leverage.  Later Tuesday, Stronghold Digital Mining (SDIG) said it was negotiating with its lenders over a possible debt restructuring or refinancing agreement that would keep the bitcoin miner afloat. Publicly traded miners have suffered in the bitcoin bear market, with their shares falling more than 60% on average this year, worse than bitcoin itself, which has lost less than half of its value. Stronghold's share price has tumbled about 70%.  Also Tuesday, Acala’s native stablecoin, aUSD, came close to regaining its peg to the U.S. dollar. The Polkadot-based decentralized finance (DeFi) platform burned over 1.2 billion aUSD tokens that were minted by exploiters over the weekend who took advantage of a bug in one of the platform’s liquidity pools.  Oanda's Moya struck an upbeat note despite bitcoin's recent retreat, highlighting institutional interest in digital assets. ""Pretty much everyone on Wall Street thought that the mid-June lows would get retested for bitcoin, but now it seems this dead cat bounce doesn’t want to stop,"" he said. ""It appears the institutional money is mostly behind this recent rebound, which suggests it could have a better chance of lasting.""

When Cypriot authorities forced the country’s people to take a haircut on deposits in 2013, they turned to bitcoin to preserve wealth.  Now, things are different. Crypto is a different kind of asset. A risk asset like tech stocks. Not the safe haven it once was.  Nobody knows when this will end, or even if it will return to where it once was.  In an email to CoinDesk, Scott Sheridan, CEO of options trading platform Tastyworks, pointed to the bull market’s major equity valuations as a magnet for more capital, which in turn drives up prices. Sheridan, for his part, rejects the idea that crypto can be considered a safe haven given its volatility.  “Crypto, on the other hand, doesn’t have the same valuation metrics. It’s still in its infancy and so are its valuation models,” he said to CoinDesk via email. “That ambiguity, with respect to valuations, is what allowed for investors to justify chasing prices higher. If I’m right on that, then I would expect the volatility in crypto to outlast the volatility in equities, something you don’t want if you’re seeking a safe haven.”  Crypto and stocks will rebound together  Sheridan thinks crypto won’t turn around until equities do and market volatility subsides.  “Once we get back to a VIX [an index measuring volatility] near its mean of 18, then I think you’ll see equity prices stabilize and at that point, you might see crypto stabilize or begin moving higher. Until then, I think the combination of potential alpha in equity markets and the evolving state and subsequent turbulence in crypto are more geared toward speculation than they are sheltered from the storm,” he continued.  ***  Speaking at this year’s Consensus festival, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz predicted it will be in October when the U.S. Federal Reserve flinches first on raising interest rates. But that all depends on how inflation goes and how economies worldwide respond. With the People’s Bank of China taking a seemingly different approach than the Fed – lowering rates while the Fed raises them – it could be a while before things stabilize.

42422536,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0mANh,1660694653,Kenya's Crypto Crowd Hopes President-Elect Will Be Better Than Predecessor,"Kenya President-Elect William Ruto is ""assumed"" to be a better hope for the crypto community in Kenya than the losing candidate Raila Odinga, according to local crypto experts.  Kenya's crypto future was not an election issue, and was not discussed by either candidate during the campaign. But his being 22 years younger than Odinga, who is 77, suggests Ruto may be more accommodative of innovation.  ""It is only an assumption that because he's younger. But ever since the cautionary notice issued by the central bank in 2018, no candidate has actually volunteered to talk about the crypto question in depth"" said Roselyne Wanjiru, a researcher at the Blockchain Association of Kenya, an industry body. Kenyan regulators have not proposed any sort of actual crypto rules to date.  It is important for the region as the nation leads Africa in crypto adoption and was recently ranked fifth globally for adoption by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). The report by the U.N. affiliate said that 8.5% of Kenya's population own cryptocurrencies and that's ahead of the 8.3% that own crypto in the United States.  Kenya's narrow presidential election result had Ruto winning 50.5% of the vote compared with Odinga's 48.8%.  Rufas Kamau, a research and markets analyst, stated that in addition to his age, Ruto's youth-friendly campaign (in which he coined the phrase ""hustler nation"") could mean he has a positive outlook on crypto.  ""The previous administration was very harsh. We don't know exactly how this change will affect crypto but he has been supportive of the youth so we are hoping he will provide opportunities through crypto,"" Kamau said.  Yvonne Kagondu, the founder of Kenya Blockchain Ladies, said that she wasn't sure which result would have been better, although one of Ruto's key policies is to appoint a gender-balanced cabinet.  ""On the one hand, Ruto is younger but he appears to be strict and his word is final and that can be scary. We weren't confident with either candidate. Regardless, we will continue to work in silence. We don't want any issues with our government,"" Kagondu said.  Eugene Mutai, an African crypto miner and the chief technology officer and co-founder of Raise, said the elections have left Kenya's crypto community in a gray area.  ""What really matters is who they actually appoint as the leader of the Central Bank of Kenya and also Ministry of Finance. This election is yet to change the story of crypto in Kenya,"" Mutai said.  Ruto's victory is not final because Odinga has rejected the result. Odinga has said that his team will pursue all legal options, potentially delaying clarity for crypto enthusiasts in Kenya.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Amitoj Singh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/08/17/kenyas-crypto-crowd-hopes-president-elect-will-be-better-than-predecessor,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f390245f38a2d181848d827b9577ddfc6cb2c088-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
