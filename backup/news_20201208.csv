Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $18,705 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 1.7% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $18,629-$19,299 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC below its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bearish signal for market technicians.    The price of bitcoin took a tumble again Tuesday, following Monday’s move lower. At around 06:00 UTC (1 a.m. ET), traders started to sell, which culminated in the price going as low as $18,629, according to CoinDesk 20 data. The price recovered somewhat and was at $18,705 as of press time.      Read More: Bitcoin Drops 2% as European Stocks See Losses on Brexit Concerns      “Short-term momentum has fallen off,” noted Katie Stockton, a technical analyst for Fairlead Strategies. “Our overbought/oversold measures support another two to three weeks of consolidation before the uptrend resumes.”      Momentum, in the form of volume, is much lower this week so far than the previous week. Exchanges tracked by CoinDesk 20 experienced under $1 billion in daily average spot activity so far this week.      Some uncertainty in the traditional markets may be seeping into the cryptocurrency ecosystem, noted Joel Edgerton, chief operating officer of exchange BitFlyer. “There is no clear market direction short term with the stimulus discussions in (the U.S.) Congress as positive and increased regulatory focus as negative,"" Edgerton told CoinDesk.      Global equity performances Tuesday are looking meek at best:    Asia’s Nikkei 225 ended the day slipping 0.30% as Japanese investors were in wait-and-see mode on a possible U.S. stimulus package.  Europe’s FTSE 100 closed flat, in the green 0.05% as traders stayed cautious due to the uncertainty of ongoing Brexit talks.

Some traders are also clearly putting some of their bitcoin holdings into ether. This can be seen by the daily trend in the spot ETH/BTC pair, which continues to be bullish, according to technical analysis standards, after reverting in late November. In other words, some traders are selling BTC to buy ETH.      “A resurgence in looking for alpha across other tokens is likely preventing bitcoin from making further gains as capital is being deployed elsewhere,"" noted Denis Vinokourov, head of research at crypto brokerage Bequant.      “Historically the holidays have seen [a] market decline as investors take profits and take time off from the market,” added Global Digital Asset’s chief operating officer, Zachary Friedman. “The sideways trending market may also see a surge in alt coins.”    Highest ether options open interest above spot is $1,120    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was down Tuesday trading around $563 and slipping 4% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Traders have amassed options at the strike price of $1,120 per 1 ETH. That level now has the highest amount of open interest on strikes above current spot price. However, 60% of strikes are still to the downside of spot, according to data from Skew.      What’s more, the big position at the $1,120 strike isn’t necessarily a bullish one.      “We can see that takers – retail or public investors – are actually net short far out-of-the-money calls at $1,120 ETH,” said Greg Magadini, chief executive officer of data aggregator Genesis Volatility.      Using options exchange Deribit’s data, Magadini showed (in the chart) that the large position at the $1,120 strike is traders who are selling those calls short on Deribit. “Retail has been short selling,” he added.

Through a partnership with node-hosting service Staked, MyEtherWallet now offers its browser and mobile wallet users the option to stake ETH tokens into the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain deposit contract, a smart contract that lays the foundations for Ethereum's revamped blockchain infrastructure.  MyEtherWallet ""users need to stake 32 ETH to participate. Staked will run a validator node for them, making it easy for the users who don't have the technical knowledge to participate, so no further action is required on the user's part,” MyEtherWallet CEO Kosala Hemachandra told CoinDesk.  Staking Ethereum 2.0  Staking ETH for the upgrade requires an Ethereum node, so Staked hosts this node and provides software for users to manage their deposits on MyEtherWallet. Staked and MyEtherWallet claim the service is non-custodial (meaning users keep control of their keys), though similar services through exchanges like Coinbase require relinquishing custody.  These stakers will become validators in the new network, the transaction processors who will replace miners under Ethereum 2.0’s new proof-of-stake design and who are paid in ETH for their services.  To become a validator, Ethereum users must stake at least 32 ETH in the Beacon Chain deposit contract. MyEtherWallet stakers will receive validator rewards in ETH, but those rewards cannot be withdrawn at least “until phase 2 (around two years),” Hemachandra said.  The Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain contract went live in the first week of November. After receiving enough ETH to kick-start Phase 0 of the migration to Eth 2.0, the Beacon Chain officially launched on Dec. 1.

Announced Tuesday, the company said it aims to become a net-zero carbon contributor for operations by 2030 and wants to help drive the adoption and efficiency of renewables within the bitcoin ecosystem. “We believe that cryptocurrency will eventually be powered completely by clean power, eliminating its carbon footprint and driving adoption of renewables globally,"" said Square and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. ""      Spain's second-largest BBVA, the second-largest bank in Spain, with about $840 billion in assets, is planning a crypto industry entrance by way of Switzerland, according to two sources. BBVA would not comment, but is said to be “launching its Europe-wide crypto initiative from Switzerland,” according to a close source. “There are still some compliance hurdles, but I expect [BBVA] will be live next month,” they said. BBVA is rumored to have integrated a digital asset custody solution, called SILO, and was among the first financial institutions to experiment with public and private blockchains in 2018.      Qualified investors? Alternative investment intermediary Vincent is seeing record interest in crypto as it launches out of beta. Between October and November, “investors looking for digital assets have grown 80%,” said Vincent co-founder Slava Rubin. Built by the team behind Indiegogo, Vincent is a kind of investment search engine, where qualified investors can browse for opportunities – actual fundraising occurs on regulated partner platforms – like regulated crypto deals from Grayscale, Republic and Cadence, among other non-crypto businesses. “Considering digital assets today represent less than 10% of the total available deal volume on Vincent, there is significant room to grow,” Rubin said. (Grayscale is a sister company to CoinDesk.)      $15B AUM Large crypto funds are riding high, with an estimated $15 billion in assets under management (AUM), an all-time high, according to CoinShare’s data. By comparison, there was $2.57 billion in AUM at the close of 2019. CoinShares, a digital asset manager, told Reuters on Monday that large-scale cryptocurrency funds saw an inflow of $429 million last week alone. The largest-ever weekly inflow was $468 million seen three weeks ago.      Ethereum, Nervos? Huobi, one of the “Big Three” Chinese exchanges, is tapping the public Nervos blockchain for its dollar-pegged stablecoin, HUSD, issued by Huobi-backed Stable Universal Limited. This is the first dollar-pegged stablecoin to go live on Nervos, which is sometimes called China’s answer to Ethereum. Currently, HUSD is an ERC-20 token based on the Ethereum blockchain that has its dollars in reserve by Paxos Trust Company. With this integration, it will also be on the Nervos blockchain through the sUDT technical standard, a native token standard launched by Nervos to compete with Ethereum’s ERC-20.      Privacy inoculation Blockchain-based “immunity passports” don’t resolve core privacy concerns, according to new research from Harry Halpin. “Identity systems based on globally unique identifiers are by nature against privacy, and putting them on a blockchain does not change this fundamental dichotomy,” said Halpin, the author of the paper “Vision: A Critique of Immunity Passports and W3C Decentralized Identifiers” and the CEO of NYM, a privacy startup developing a mixnet. “In fact, putting this data on a blockchain tends to make privacy problems worse, and it’s not clear that hand-waving about zero-knowledge proofs really changes the situation.”    Quick bites  BLOCK-U-SIGN?

Bitcoin is facing selling pressure on Tuesday. The leading cryptocurrency dropped below $19,000, a more than 2% decline on the day, according to CoinDesk 20 data. The decline comes after multiple rejections near $19,400 in the past 48 hours, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reports. Large sell orders were placed around the all-time high of $19,920, capping the upside, as traders look poised to liquidate their holdings. For instance, the balance held in “accumulation addresses,” i.e., large bags, has declined by over 4% to 2,698,719 bitcoin in the past three weeks, according to data source Glassnode.    At stake    Squaring the circle? In the period before President-elect Joe Biden takes office, several Democrat lawmakers have come out swinging against favorable, crypto-focused guidance issued under the Trump administration.      Most notably is the Stablecoin Tethering and Bank Licensing Enforcement (STABLE) Act, introduced by U.S. Representatives Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), Jesús “Chuy” García (D-Ill.) and Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) last week.      The bill, if passed, would essentially treat stablecoin issuers as deposit holders and therefore be subject to certain banking regulations. As Blockchain Bites reported earlier, much of the crypto community has come out against the proposed legislation – with many saying it fails to understand the nature of decentralized, programmable money and would hinder the growth of an emergent industry.      It’s a bit of a black box how a President Biden will run his administration, especially regarding financial matters. While campaigned he told rich donors, i.e., Wall Street, “nothing would fundamentally change"" if he's elected. And he has gone on to nominate or float financially lenient regulators, such as Janet Yellen, for cabinet positions.      Yellen is on record as saying she believes the U.S. financial regulators should allow blockchain and cryptocurrency projects to develop, saying in 2015 the Federal Reserve and other regulators might have “limited authority” over digital currency systems.      That said, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire believes the incoming administration will “ultimately be supportive of cryptocurrency because it represents a seismic shift as large as the commercial internet.” Allaire’s Circle is part of the CENTRE consortium that oversees the USDC stablecoin.      The Biden administration is “going to be focused on infrastructure changes that make America more competitive, and this is absolutely going to be a core building block in that,” Allaire said on CNBC. He did not comment on the STABLE Act directly, but noted there are moderates in office that believe in constructive approaches to regulation.      If the economy is the biggest story in this election cycle, the growing crypto dollar sector – now over $20 billion – is hard to ignore.

42385274,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnyw1,1607448133,Secondary Mining Markets Surge Amid ASIC Manufacturing Delays,"Secondary markets for bitcoin mining machines are red-hot as a surge in demand from miners has caused severe delays in order fulfillment from manufacturers.      Two of the mining industry’s largest manufacturers, Bitmain and MicroBT, are sold out of new machines until May 2021 as demand has overrun current manufacturing capacity. Scrambling for even more machines, miners are turning to secondary markets for whatever they can find.      Bitmain’s international marketing director, Nathaniel Yu, confirmed that the company is sold out of inventory until May 2021 in an email to CoinDesk. Bitcoin’s 166% year-to-date rally is a “key driver” of surging demand for new machines, especially for Bitmain’s 19 Series, Yu said.      Vincent Zhang, vice president of sales for Bitmain’s leading competitor, MicroBT, declined to comment on his firm’s current inventory but noted that demand for efficient mining machines is high.      “When the price ran up, everyone gobbled up orders,” said Kevin Zhang, vice president of business development for New York-based mining company Foundry, referring to bitcoin’s strong recovery off of a 50% intraday price crash in March.      Producing enough new machines to meet demand is especially challenging because of the competition for mining chips, Zhang said. (His company is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which is also the parent company of CoinDesk.)      The same 7 and 8 nanometer chips that miner manufacturers need are also in high demand by other technology giants like Apple and Nvidia. When competing for supply against these firms, bitcoin mining companies are generally a lower-priority customer.      Unable to receive new machines from manufacturers battling supply-line complications, miners are swarming to secondary markets.      Trading activity on these otherwise much quieter markets is at or even above pre-halving levels, according to data approximations from Guzmán Pintos, co-founder of mining software company Luxor Technologies. Before the third bitcoin halving event in May, the mining subsidy was twice its current size, allowing for a larger pool of profitable market participants.      An even starker imbalance between supply and demand was drawn by Thomas Heller, chief operations officer at mining software company HASHR8, in a direct message with CoinDesk. Heller said secondary markets for mining hardware are the hottest they’ve been since late 2017 or early 2018 during the cryptocurrency market's last peak.      “Nobody wants to sell. Everyone wants to buy,” Pintos told CoinDesk.      Strong demand for any available machines is reflected in the high volatility and premiums of ASIC prices. For some machines, the per-unit price can “easily change 10-20% on a weekly basis,"" Pintos said.      It’s not uncommon for the upward volatility of second-hand mining machines to often exceed bitcoin’s volatility, Heller added.      In recent months, prices for second-hand, lower generation mining machines have increased upwards of 40%-50%, according to Mason Jappa, CEO of Blockware Solutions, one of the leading mining hardware and service providers. Newer machines like the S19 Pro have seen more mild price increases of around 25% on secondary markets.      With Bitmain and MicroBT sold out through May 2021, Jappa said, the mining hardware market has been transformed into “truly a seller’s market at this point.”      Blockware expects the current trend of strong demand and limited supply to intensify with more and more miners “scrambling to purchase machines on the secondary market with as quick as a timeline for delivery as possible,” Jappa said.      Mining conditions – not to mention the bitcoin price itself – are “very bullish at the moment,” he told CoinDesk. According to Jappa, timelines for future batches of machines from Bitmain and MicroBT will continue to be extended, and prices on secondary markets will continue to appreciate.

42385281,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnz4p,1607446802,How BitGo Is Getting Into the Events Business,"BitGo has added capital introduction (cap intro) services, a kind of marketing activity carried out among hedge fund investors, to its suite of white-glove crypto brokerage services.      Through a series of invitation-only roundtables with hedge fund managers, BitGo Prime says it will bring together asset managers, family offices, sovereign funds, pension funds, endowments and high-net-worth individuals. Think of it as a way for BitGo, not Coinbase, to land the next MicroStrategy.      Prime brokerage, a term that means different things to different people, comprises a bundle of services including custody, lending and taking care of clearing and settlement. In the traditional financial world it’s often provided by large investment banks to hedge fund clients.      Read more: Behind ‘Prime Broker’ Buzzword Lies a Complex Strategy Game for Crypto Firms      BitGo Prime began offering crypto lending services at the end of last year, and added the ability to trade directly out of cold storage (crypto kept at an arm's length from the internet). In April of this year, BitGo acquired Lumina, a firm that does tax reporting and portfolio accounting.      Cap intro – the concept was supposedly introduced by Morgan Stanley Prime Brokerage in 1997 to connect clients with target investors – plays a prominent role in traditional markets. BitGo is now including it for crypto – but with a twist, said BitGo Prime CEO Nick Carmi.      “We’re adding a slightly different twist to cap intro services from a crypto perspective, using it also as a way to educate the investor community in the financial market space about crypto,” said Carmi.    Showtime    BitGo is hosting its first cap intro event today, Tuesday, where three managers will present their strategies.      BitGo’s presenting managers are Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead, portfolio manager Delfos Machado Neto and LedgerPrime Chief Investment Officer Shiliang Tang.

Standard Chartered’s crypto trading group comprises five of the biggest over-the-counter (OTC) traders and four exchanges, and will include an Ethereum-based settlement token, a well-placed source told CoinDesk.      The firms involved in the custody and trading project include LMAX and ErisX, according to the source. Also supporting the project are Switzerland-based custody provider METACO, in which Standard Chartered has invested; and U.K.-based trading technology provider Cobalt (where Standard Chartered is also an investor).      Standard Chartered and the other firms named in the group all declined to comment.      “Standard Chartered plus five of the biggest traders in digital assets and four exchanges are about to get this new model started,” said the source. “I think the first test trade will be next month and I’d say it’ll end up involving the 10 biggest exchanges in digital.”    Tether, but for banks?    A settlement token used in Standard Chartered’s crypto trading platform will be based on the Ethereum ERC-20 standard, the source added.      “A lot of people were pushing to use Hyperledger, Corda, but we have specifically gone for something the native crypto community are comfortable with,” the source said.      The system will create an institution-focused equivalent of Silvergate Bank’s exchange network (SEN), the source added.      “We are building our own token of fiat collateral and hoping that will become the equivalent of Tether, except that the tokenized collateral or money will be held in the trading bank account of a proper bank, like a Standard Chartered, a JPMorgan, a Deutsche Bank,” the source said.      (The token sounds somewhat akin to the Avit, a bank-issued digital asset from Caitlin Long’s Avanti Financial.)      Standard Chartered’s innovation arm, SC Ventures, was reported to be working on an institutional crypto custody project back in the summer. The bank is involved in multiple projects touching on crypto including an anti-money laundering (AML) solution. Speaking at a virtual event Monday, Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters teased that an announcement was in the works.      “Standard Chartered has been working on this for a long time and is jointly working with other giants in the crypto space,” a second source involved in the build told CoinDesk. “This is extremely serious and not some proof of concept. They have passed all the checks and compliance and are bringing in some exciting names.”      Big banks who once shunned crypto are fast warming to the idea, with Spain’s second-largest lender, BBVA, said to be launching a digital asset custody and trading offering out of Switzerland early next year.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/12/08/standard-chartered-bank-to-launch-crypto-trading-for-institutional-investors-sources,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/22cc5bf76c4ce39c3877a108b37d147f91546421-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385280,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnz65,1607441851,RSK Is Changing How It 'Pegs' Bitcoin to Its Sidechain,"Bitcoin sidechain developer RSK is revamping how users swap bitcoin for its network’s tokenized version of the cryptocurrency.      IOVlabs, the company that develops the RSK platform, has created a new system for monitoring how bitcoin is “pegged to” (or, swapped for) RBTC, a token that represents a 1-1 peg to real bitcoin. RBTC is the native coin on the RSK sidechain – a Bitcoin scaling solution that uses a blockchain-like network that sacrifices decentralization in favor of faster transaction speeds.      Before this change, RSK users would send bitcoin to a multi-signature wallet address – a wallet controlled by 12 different parties. The “signatories” for this wallet would then approve the transaction and transfer the proportional RBTC to the user’s RSK wallet.    Powpeg    The new system, dubbed Powpeg, will supplant these with an automated process, and most of the 12 signatories will now act as “pegnatories,” a group of validators who will monitor the RSK multi-signature wallet and the minting of RBTC to protect against wrongdoing.      Unlike the previous design, Powpeg automates the final step of the RBTC minting process. Now when users send bitcoin to the multi-sig wallet, they generate a proof of that transaction and then send this proof to “special-purpose hardware security modules called PowHSMs,” according to an IOVlabs press release. Once these modules receive the proof, they distribute the RBTC to the corresponding user.      In the event the user does not reveal the proof, the pegnatories will provide the proof, but they do not manually sign off on the transaction; that’s the PowHSM’s job, which also stores the individual private keys for each signatory.    Decentralizing how sidechains work    RSK co-founder and IOVlabs Chief Innovation Officer Sergio Lerner told CoinDesk that miners, exchanges and mining pools will make up the first round of pegnatories. He also expects that the number of pegnatories “probably will grow in size in the months to come” since the “security risks associated with adding pegnatories are much lower than [signatories] in a federation.”      IOVlabs says the design change was made to decentralize the pegging process for RSK and minimize the trust involved between the pegnatories and the users.      The Powpeg redesign comes on the heels of IOVlab’s efforts to bring the utility of Ethereum’s DeFi apps to Bitcoin’s ecosystem. The RSK sidechain features a number of DeFi-like services, including the MakerDAO-like stablecoin platform Money on Chain and Sovryn, a Bitcoin lending and derivatives market.      Launched in 2018, RSK is a Bitcoin sidechain which can support Ethereum smart contracts. The RSK sidechain is “merge mined” with Bitcoin, meaning miners who mine Bitcoin’s blockchain also contribute hash rate to mine blocks on RSK. According to IOVlabs, mining pools representing 50% of Bitcoin’s hashpower currently mine on the RSK chain.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MINING | SPONSORED,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/12/08/rsk-is-changing-how-it-pegs-bitcoin-to-its-sidechain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7393c656d4b9ab5044f1b8c2ac7d0fdbbac19401-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385286,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnzB7,1607436110,First Mover: Wells Fargo Bitcoin Briefing Could Signal Bull Run Intact,"Bitcoin was lower for a second day, dropping below $19,000 after bulls failed to push prices past the psychological $20,000 threshold.      ""The overly confident market has been dampened,"" the Norwegian crypto-market analysis firm Arcane Research wrote Tuesday in a report.      In traditional markets, European shares slid, led by travel-related companies, and U.S. stock futures pointed to a lower open as investors worried over the impact of rising coronavirus case numbers. The British pound weakened for a third day as optimism over a Brexit breakthrough faded, according to Bloomberg News. Gold was little changed at $1,863 an ounce.    Market moves    One theme comes up repeatedly in conversations with crypto insiders: just how fast the industry is moving. Even jaded pros are sometimes astonished (and annoyed) at how much new information they have to process each day.      Contrast that dynamic with the pace of progress in the U.S. stock market, where lately economic stimulus seems to be the only real thread in the news. There are reports of proposed stimulus bills from Congress, speculation over who might benefit most from stimulus and analysis on whether the stimulus is already priced in. Even last week's disappointing report on U.S. jobs growth served to drive up stock prices, based on the topsy-turvy logic the prospects for more economic stimulus had increased.      Bitcoin prices have stagnated around $19,000 since surging last week to a new all-time high, yet the industry developments show no signs of slowing. Monday alone brought news of the cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex looking to list tokenized versions of stocks like Apple, Amazon and Tesla and an announcement by the digital-asset fund Arca of new custodial support for a tokenized U.S. Treasury bond fund. On the regulatory front, G7 finance ministers during a closed-door virtual session reportedly discussed the need to implement new rules for digital currencies, perhaps looking to slow things down.      There has certainly been no slackening in the pace of newcomers from traditional finance nudging into the crypto space or simply commenting on the bitcoin craze.      On Monday, a unit of Wells Fargo, the giant (and, at least for the past several years, beleaguered) U.S. bank, published a seven-page report devoting a full page to bitcoin.      ""Cryptocurrency investing is a bit like living in the early days of the 1850s gold rush,"" according to the report from the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. ""As we roll into 2021, we'll be discussing the digital-asset space more – its upside and downside.""      That's an explicit indication that even more attention is coming the way of cryptocurrencies, not less, as the calendar year rolls over.      But it turns out that bitcoin itself isn't moving particularly quickly, at least by the historical standards of the underlying blockchain network. And that might be a bullish indicator.      On Monday, First Mover dug into one cryptocurrency fund's analysis of whether bitcoin has climbed too far, too fast, or if the rally is just getting going. (ICYMI: Projected growth in the blockchain network suggests a price of $51,611 to $118,544 in five years, as valued under Metcalfe's Law.)      Another firm, Coin Metrics, which specializes in blockchain data analysis, noted in a recent report that it tracks a measure known as ""1-year active supply."" This is the proportion of total bitcoin supply transferred over the blockchain network over the past year.      ""As BTC price rises, an increasing amount of dormant supply typically starts to become active as long-term holders sell or move their BTC,"" Coin Metrics wrote, using the trading symbol for bitcoin. ""Conversely, when BTC price is low for extended periods of time, 1-year active supply percent tends to drop as investors hold through crypto winters.""      Recently, the 1-year active supply percentage appears to have ticked up slightly, climbing from a low of 36.5% reached in early September. But the metric is still below 40%, and well off the 59% reached in early 2018, in the wake of bitcoin's last bull run to nearly $20,000.      That might indicate there's little appetite among bitcoin holders to take profits just yet. And it means that newcomers might have to pay up if they want to get in.      - Bradley Keoun    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin is on the offer this Thursday morning alongside losses in the European stock markets.      The top cryptocurrency is trading well below $19,000, representing more than a 2% drop on the day, having faced multiple rejections near $19,400 in the past 48 hours.      Risk sentiment has soured with fading prospects of the U.K.-European Union trade deal; major European indices are down 0.3% and futures tied to the S&P 500 are pointing to a negative open.      Bitcoin's repeated failure to keep gains above $19,000 and evidence of investors liquidating at current levels is forcing some analysts to reassess bullish positioning.      “We are leaning bearish here and beginning to unwind some long exposure in bitcoin and DeFi selections,” said Patrick Heusser, a senior cryptocurrency trader at Zurich-based Crypto Broker AG. “The reasoning is on some technicals and how the spot market is structured, with large orders at around the lifetime high.”      The pullback could gather steam if risk aversion in global stock markets worsen, giving a lift to the safe-haven U.S. dollar. That's because the cryptocurrency's price moves have roughly mimicked those of global equity markets, while moving in the opposite direction from the dollar index, since the March crash. The 40% rally seen in November came alongside impressive gains in global equities and a sell-off in the U.S. dollar. As such, it is too early to say that bitcoin has become resilient to a potential sell-off in equities – or a rebound in the dollar.      The global macro trade of sell-dollars-and-buy-everything-denominated-in dollars is still very much active. If the dollar bounces due to stock market sell-off or any other factor, the cryptocurrency could suffer a notable price pullback.      Support is seen at $18,500 (Dec. 5 low) followed by $18,000 (psychological hurdle), and $16,200 (50-day SMA). Resistance is located at $19,400 (Sunday-Monday high), $19,920 (record high).      - Omkar Godbole    What's hot    MicroStrategy plans to sell up to $400M in a convertible senior notes sale to fund more bitcoin allocations (CoinDesk)      How one bitcoin options trader turned $638K into $4.4M in 5 weeks (CoinDesk)      Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters says creation and adoption of digital currencies is ""absolutely inevitable"" (CNBC)      G7 officials stress need to regulate digital currencies, U.S. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin says in statement (CoinDesk)      Crypto exchange Bittrex lists tokenized Apple, Amazon, Tesla stocks for trading (CoinDesk)      Switzerland's SIX stock exchange joins venture opening up digital assets to Swiss banks (CoinDesk)      Institutional investors put $429M into cryptocurrency funds and products during week ended Dec. 7, second highest on record, pushing sector's AUM to record $15B (Reuters)      Arca reaches deal with Anchorage, Gemini, Komainu, Ledger and TokenSoft to get support for tokenized U.S. Treasury-bond fund ArCoin, marking ""first time a registered digital security can be widely stored (managed, self-managed, third-party managed and self-custody) by multiple digital custody providers"" (Cision)      Decentralized computing platform Blockstack gets Stacks token declassified as a security, making it tradable in U.S. (CoinDesk)      MobileCoin, cryptocurrency project advised by Signal founder, goes live with trading on FTX exchange (CoinDesk)    Analogs  The latest on the economy and traditional finance    Business coronavirus liability-shield compromise remains elusive in relief-bill talks (Politico)      Europe seeks to boost pandemic-damaged economy by spending (WSJ)      Juiciest stock market gains may already be priced in, with valuations at lofty levels, especially since ""shareholders of airlines, shopping-mall owners and travel companies will be using a big chunk of future profits to pay for the debt needed to survive 2020, columnist James Mackintosh writes (WSJ)      Shares of Chinese companies on U.S. blacklist fall as index eviction looms (WSJ)      Demand for corporate bonds drives inflation-adjusted yields to zero (WSJ)    Tweet of the day",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole, Sebastian Sinclair",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/08/first-mover-wells-fargo-bitcoin-briefing-could-signal-bull-run-intact,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a51f6d6edcf0ad38da41628e7416e94e29ba13aa-1250x908.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Other verticals include real estate, venture capital, private equity, debt, art and collectibles. More crypto, such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), will be added soon, according to Rubin.      To date, more than 100,000 investment searches have been conducted by 15,000 unique investors, Rubin said.      “We’re in touch with a few larger crypto investment platforms to add their deals into our search engine,” he said. “For us, we do want to vet each platform we work with to ensure compliance and trust, so it takes a bit longer with an asset class as new as crypto.”      Vincent is the brainchild of Indiegogo founder Rubin and former Indiegogo investing lead Evan Cohen. They are joined by fintech entrepreneur Eric Cantor and technology lead Ross Cohen, former head of engineering at Mirror, the hardware firm that sold to Lululemon for $500 million earlier this year.    Vincent’s funding    Investors in the $2 million round include Uncommon Denominator, Rubin’s own Humbition, ERA and The Fund, as well as several strategic angels including Jeff Fagnan (Accomplice, AngelList), Alap Shah (Sentieo) and Lazslo Bock (Google, Humu).      Vincent users are asked to self-qualify as accredited investors where necessary and explain how they are verified, said Rubin. Thereafter the actual transactions are happening on the partner platforms, which perform their own know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) checks.      Rubin said the average Vincent user is looking at about 25 deals and comparing multiple asset classes, rather than focusing on any one area.      “This gives you a broader understanding of the landscape,” Rubin said. “If you want to get totally committed to one thing then great. We think the way this market is going to become much bigger is to make it easier for people to discover and analyze alternatives.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/12/08/crypto-demand-surges-on-indiegogo-founders-alternative-investments-platform,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/acf46f543d800911fbcd83a7f13c6e3402764a2e-1500x994.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385284,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnz8b,1607428859,Huobi's HUSD Stablecoin to Run on Nervos Blockchain,"Public blockchain Nervos has been trying to become China’s answer to Ethereum, especially when it comes to the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. Soon it will finally have a key element in that quest: the blockchain’s first dollar-pegged stablecoin, HUSD, issued by Huobi-backed Stable Universal Limited.      This is also the first blockchain outside of Ethereum to support HUSD. Seychelles-based Huobi is one of the “Big Three” exchanges popular among Chinese users, along with Binance and OKEx.      Currently, HUSD is an ERC-20 token based on the Ethereum blockchain that has its dollars in reserve by Paxos Trust Company. With this integration, it will also be on the Nervos blockchain through the sUDT technical standard, a native token standard launched by Nervos to compete with Ethereum’s ERC-20.      Once the integration of HUSD on the Nervos blockchain is complete, users of Nervos will be able to deposit U.S. dollars in their account and receive HUSD at a 1:1 ratio sent to their preferred crypto wallets, according to a news release published earlier Tuesday.      Nervos is backed by established companies including Sequoia China, Polychain Capital and China Merchants Bank International (CMBI), a wholly owned subsidiary of China Merchants Bank. Nervos is also among the list of six major public blockchains that are available on China’s state-sanctioned blockchain infrastructure project, Blockchain-Based Service Network (BSN).      “HUSD will serve a variety of roles in DeFi use cases [on Nervos], including usage as a payment token, a store of value, and a bridge between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies” the news release said.      Stablecoins have played a significant role in the booming DeFi space since the past summer, as DeFi users trade their stablecoins on a variety of DeFi platforms to receive high yields.      Kevin Wang, co-founder of Nervos, told CoinDesk that while the company plans to support more stablecoins in the future, it chose to support HUSD as the first stablecoin partly due to the involvement of the HUSD’s issuer Stablecoin Universal team in the development of its sUDT.      “It was critical for us to find a partner who has the technical expertise and flexibility to ensure a smooth rollout,” Wang said.      As CoinDesk reported previously, there has been growing interest in DeFi in China driven by retail investors. As it has been for the crypto trading market there, DeFi has been gaining traction in China partly because the key opinion leaders (KOLs), in-person meetups and online Ask Me Anything (AMA) gatherings have resumed to previous levels after the country’s COVID-19 pandemic restrictions were mostly lifted.      At press time, about $14.63 billion worth of total value was locked in DeFi protocols, according to data provider DeFi Pulse. That figure is up 13.6% from Nov. 27.      Meanwhile, data from Glassnode shows the market capitalization of HUSD more than doubled during the time period between Oct. 15 and Nov. 11, to approximately $287.8 million from $130.1 million.      Frank Zhang, chief executive officer of Stable Universal, attributed the significant growth of HUSD mainly to the integration of HUSD on a large number of popular decentralized finance platforms.      “It’s an especially exciting time for DeFi as it’s still a nascent market,” Zhang said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/08/huobis-husd-stablecoin-to-run-on-nervos-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ec6be2d17fed0cf96135998f4edede93a9b344b5-1500x1173.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The balance held in so-called accumulation addresses has declined by over 4% to 2,698,719 bitcoin in the past three weeks, according to data source Glassnode.      With the repeated rejections near all-time highs, the cryptocurrency is beginning to look heavy on technical charts, forcing some traders to reassess their bullish positioning.      ""We are leaning bearish here and beginning to unwind some long exposure in bitcoin and DeFi selections,"" said Patrick Heusser, a senior cryptocurrency trader at Zurich-based Crypto Broker AG, referring to decentralized finance. ""The reasoning is on some technicals and how the spot market is structured with large orders at around the lifetime high.""      Bitcoin's 14-day relative strength index recently charted a bearish divergence, or lower high, possibly warning of an impending price pullback. The MACD histogram, an indicator used to gauge trend strength and shifts, is producing deeper bars below the zero line, also indicating a downside move may be imminent.      A potential sell-off in the stock markets could be a driver for a notable price pullback in bitcoin. The cryptocurrency has rallied to record highs, but has yet to decouple from the stock markets. The ascent from $10,000 to $19,920 seen over the past three months happened amid the bullish price action in the equity markets.

According to a Reuters report citing data from digital asset manager CoinShares on Monday, large-scale cryptocurrency funds saw an inflow of $429 million last week alone. The largest-ever weekly inflow was $468 million seen three weeks ago.      The data showed the sector jumped to an all-time high of $15 billion in assets under management (AUM) for the year so far.
