42413321,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8MPk,1410718530,"10 Physical Bitcoins: the Good, the Bad and the Ugly","Physical bitcoins have been around for years, but they are anything but mainstream and there are very few companies involved in this fledgling industry. Some try to appeal to consumers through quality and the use of precious metals, others offer good designs at relatively low prices, while some offer neither.  The market for physical coins is limited and this is a niche for collectors and diehard enthusiasts. Rather than being truly practical, physical bitcoins are usually marketed as conversation pieces, limited series collectibles or 'geek gifts'.  The limited size of the industry is a problem, as a number of firms have already gone out of business, while others never even started shipping their products. Many physical bitcoins are limited series affairs, so after a few hundred are produced and sold they simply vanish from the market. If beauty is in the eye of the beholder, then, while there are some truly spectacular designs, others may not impress most users.  Fraud is another concern, as cases of fake coin sales on online auction sites have been reported in the past, so please exercise caution and conduct extensive research before placing an order.  Below are 10 physical bitcoins on the market.  1. Casascius  We will start with a familiar face and a familiar coin: Mike Caldwell and his Casascius coin. Caldwell started minting his coins a couple of years ago, but late last year he was banned from selling pre-funded coins.  The US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) classified his activities as 'money transmitting' and Caldwell was forced to start selling empty coins. Sales resumed earlier this year and Casascius is currently listing three coins, along with a gold-plated savings bar. However, none of them are priced and it is unclear whether or not Casascius simply ran out of stock or stopped selling them directly altogether.  In addition to these silver, brass and gold-plated products, Casascius also sells aluminium promo coins. A bag of 500 costs 0.39 BTC.  2. Alitin Mint  Alitin Mint  offers two premium coins, with a third design on the way. The first two coins commemorate economic pioneer Adam Smith and French patron saint Joan of Arc. They are pure silver coins and weigh two ounces. Both coins were designed by presidential sculptor John B Andelin.  Only 600 coins of each series were struck and the pricing reflects the exclusivity. The Adam Smith coin is priced at 2.92 BTC and it ships with 2 BTC, while the Joan of Arc coin costs 1.45 BTC and comes with one embedded bitcoin.  3. Titan Bitcoin  Titan Bitcoin  is going after the premium market with the priciest Titan One Gold coin priced at $2,279, but then again it contains 1 troy ounce of 24-karat gold and one bitcoin. The Titan One Silver is a one-ounce .999 silver coin and it costs $729, with one bitcoin on board.  The company has some less expensive options too, with three more coins in triple-digit territory and denominations ranging from 0.5 BTC to 1 BTC. In addition, there is the Titan Tenth coin, which is currently on sale for $96. It is a 12g nickel-silver alloy piece pre-funded to the tune of 0.1 BTC  4. Cryptmint coins  If you’re not willing to spend a small fortune on a novelty item and the Titan Tenth sounds like a good proposition, Cryptmint is also selling a $99 silver coin. This .999 silver coin measures 39mm in diameter and weighs in at 1 troy ounce.  The company also sells copper coins at $42 apiece. Customers can choose from six different QR designs on the back. The coins ship without any bitcoin preloaded.  5. Antana Coins  Antana  offers relatively affordable novelty coins and the mint has a healthy sense of humour. Each batch contains network statistic data for a period and a particular theme.  Different batches have different names that should amuse most bitcoiners. There was the ‘Goodbye Mt Gox’ batch and the ‘Transaction Malleability’ batch, preceded by batches such as ‘Pump and Dump’ and ‘Race for ROI’.  The coins sell for 0.02 BTC to 0.04 BTC and the full set of 20 Antana bitcoin statistic coins costs 0.41 BTC. Although they are not physical coins with QR codes and holograms, they still make for an unusual bitcoin-themed product.  6. Ravenbit Satoshi coin  Ravenbit  is offering the Satoshi coin and the kit is priced at $25. The kit includes a coin, two security holograms, a pouch, display stand a few other goodies.  The Satoshi coin is composed of 85% copper, has a 39mm diameter and is 3mm thick. The front features an outline of person filled out in binary code that converts to ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’. Each coin is individually numbered.  7. CoinedBits  Staying on the more frugal side of things, CoinedBits coins are priced at $14.99 for North American consumers or $19.99 for overseas orders.  Like Antana coins, CoinedBits are novelty items with no bitcoin value and they are not physical wallets. The coins are 38mm in diameter, 3mm thick and weigh one ounce. The material is pure brass with 18-karat gold plating.  8. Lealana coins  Lealana  offers a wide range of unfunded coins with prices ranging from 0.042 BTC to 0.325 BTC for the flagship gold-plated silver Lealana 1 BTC coin. A four-coin silver bitcoin set is available 0.891 BTC.  The company also offers several litecoin designs.  9. Coins that never materialised  There were a number of physical bitcoin projects that never amounted to anything. Most are either defunct or delayed. Although they never got off the ground, some them had certain features that make them stand out from the crowd.  A Chinese bitcoiner minted a small batch of one-ounce physical coins and the images were posted on the 8btc.com blog earlier this summer. The coin weighs one standard ounce (rather than one troy ounce) and is made from 24-karat gold. The 1 BTC coin was apparently supposed to ship pre-funded. The current status of the project is unclear.  Alderney, one of the British Channel Islands, considered launching a physical coin of its own. Plans for a physical coin were announced late last year, but appear to have been shelved for the time being.  10. DIY coins  There is another way of getting your hands on a physical bitcoin – make one yourself. We are not suggesting that you set up a foundry and mint in your garage; a simple 3D printer will do the trick.  There are a number of print-ready 3D designs out there and they are just a Google search away, usually on 3D print marketplaces like Shapeways.  The trouble with this approach is that most designs are relatively expensive, even before you include the cost of actually printing them. While it is relatively cheap to do a few plastic prints on semi-professional fused-filament printers, making a proper metal coin on an expensive laser-sintering printer tends to cost a lot.  In any case, 3D printing is an alternative way of producing unique physical coins by tweaking existing designs or developing your own.  One example of an affordable design that relies on nylon plastic with a matte finish is the Bitcoin Address Keeper by Ayame Deude. The 3D model costs €8.50 and, if you have access to a printer, the actual cost of printing a single coin should be low.  3D printing fulfilment services are another option, but in many cases the cost of shipping a single coin would be higher than the cost of printing it.

42377632,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72Vcl,1410713143,Europe's Top 5 Countries for Bitcoin ATMs,"This article is a continuation of our previous analysis of the most popular US states for bitcoin using data from CoinDesk's bitcoin ATM map.  As public interest in digital currencies grows, bitcoin ATMs have proven to be critical for bridging the gap between casual onlookers and active bitcoin owners.    To identify the areas where bitcoin ATMs are particularly popular, we analyzed data from CoinDesk’s bitcoin ATM map and calculated the countries in Europe with the most machines per capita.      Of course, the term ‘popular’ is subjective by nature and there are countless ways to measure it, but for the purpose of this report, popularity is defined by the number of bitcoin ATMs per capita in each European country.    Data analysis    Our data for Europe include a total of 64 bitcoin ATMs distributed across 20 countries. The UK and Netherlands are home to more than 30% of Europe's bitcoin ATMs with 10 machines in each country.      When adjusting for each country's population, the UK ranks only eleventh most popular in Europe for the digital currency machines. Other countries with multiple bitcoin ATMs that missed the top five include the Czech Republic, ranked sixth with six ATMs; Switzerland, ranked seventh with three ATMs; and Italy, ranked 14th with four ATMs.      Here are the top five most popular European countries for bitcoin, ranked by the number of bitcoin ATMs per capita:    1. Isle of Man  One bitcoin ATM for every 87,000 people  It may not be the biggest or most populous place in Europe, but the Isle of Man is certainly leading the way in embracing bitcoin. A conference devoted to the island's booming digital currency economy is taking place this week on 17th and 18th September.  2. Slovenia  One bitcoin ATM for every 687,000 people  Home to popular exchange Bitstamp, Slovenia has welcomed bitcoin businesses – including ATMs – with open arms. Despite a population of only two million people, the country has three bitcoin ATMs on file in our records.  3. Finland  One bitcoin ATM for every 777,000 people  Finland is host to Europe's very first bitcoin ATM, which was installed in Helsinki in December of last year. Since then, six more machines have arrived, showing the Finns' demand for the digital currency.  4. Ireland  One bitcoin ATM for every 1.55 million people  Bitcoin has seen a warm reception in Ireland. The country's first bitcoin ATM went live in Dublin back in March, and one prominent figure from the Central Bank of Ireland has spoken about the country's future with bitcoin.  5. The Netherlands  One bitcoin ATM for every 1.68 million people  The Netherlands, along with the UK, is home to the most bitcoin ATMs in Europe with 10 machines. The world's first Bitcoin Boulevard also opened in Holland this year, and has attracted digital currency enthusiasts from all over.

42377634,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72VbV,1410703501,"Huobi, OKCoin Celebrate Chinese Bitcoin Industry at Weekend Galas","This weekend has seen two large gala evening events hosted by large Chinese bitcoin exchanges: Huobi's first anniversary celebrations on Saturday and the 'One Night in Beijing with OKCoin' mini-conference on Friday.  Both took place at five-star hotels in Beijing, with attendees numbering several hundred for each event. Each event featured an exhibition of Chinese bitcoin companies that included app developers, ATM manufacturers and mining hardware makers.  Chinese bitcoin news site Bitell reported that OKCoin's event at the Westin Hotel featured a keynote speech by CEO Star Xu, and the official launch of the company's new Virtual Futures trading platform.  There were also roundtable discussion topics concerning bitcoin's outlook in China, a debate and launch of the new book, The Controversial Bitcoin.  Huobi  marked one year since its launch on 1st September, 2013, at the Shangri-La Hotel with the first 'China Bitcoin Industry Summit' featuring presentations, panel discussions, and a huge birthday cake.  The company used the event as a launching platform for several new services including BitYes, its international USD-based trading platform, and DigCoin, Huobi's mining-based investment product.  CEO Leon Li said:    ""Huobi is more than a bitcoin exchange, it is a comprehensive bitcoin services company.""            It also handed out a series of awards for mining companies, impressive applications, and innovative bitcoin media.  Shifting sands  The mood surrounding bitcoin exchanges in China has shifted visibly since May this year, when the five largest players withdrew booths and speakers from China's first international bitcoin conference at the last minute.  Huobi's Robert Kuhne said there have been no public statements from the Chinese government in the past few months, and that exchanges now have a much better idea of the boundaries within which they operate.  Now large exchanges are expected to attend the next big China event, Shanghai's Bitcoin Expo on 19th-21st September. OKCoin is listed as a major sponsor and CEO Li as a speaker.  All this occurs as China's larger exchanges have adapted their business models to suit the local environment – rather than focus on market speculation as they did last year, they have recently diversified their offerings with margin trading, derivatives, bitcoin wallets and even P2P lending.  The exchanges have also moved closer to China's other bitcoin mega-industry, bitcoin mininghttp://www.thecoinsman.com/2014/08/bitcoin/inside-chinese-bitcoin-mine/, taking part-shares in mining factories and participation in mining pools, cloud mining and other investment products.  Other bitcoin startups face rocky road  This could be both good and not-so-good news for bitcoin on China. It could signify that acceptance of bitcoin is growing, or that authorities no longer consider it influential in mainstream life.  A source from the Chinese bitcoin scene, who preferred not to be named, said of the exchanges' expanding businesses:  ""[It's an] inevitable trend of the overall industry, but small startups are facing a bigger challenge.""  The attention is drawing in outsiders and new investors who wanted to get involved in bitcoin, but some mining and application startups are having a tough time finding both customers and investment. For example, startup wallet service Bihang posted a notice last week saying it is to close down.  Rui Ma  , China-based partner at 500 Startups, agreed that Chinese venture capital interest in smaller bitcoin startups is ""definitely low"", and that mainstream VC investors are ""not taking it seriously"" for reasons of lack of legal clarity, low visibility and daily use in China and better opportunities for tech entrepreneurs outside the bitcoin sphere.  Kuhne added that while things could easily change in future, there is still optimism.  ""There is so much excitement because of fast-developing technology and all the money to be made,"" he said.

42395313,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASaHJp,1410693335,Why Bitcoin Mining Can No Longer Ignore Moore’s Law,"The bitcoin mining industry has witnessed massive change over the past two years. The technological arms race launched by ASIC makers quickly put an end to GPU and FPGA (field-programmable gate array) mining, but much like the Cold War arms race, additional investments may prove unsustainable in the long run due to ROI constraints.  Currently, miners are hitting the wall. Technology is the first problem. Most miners are already using the latest nodes, namely 28nm and 20nm processors offered by TSMC and GlobalFoundries, while the first 14nm/16nm FinFET ASICs are expected next year. Yet progress is slowing down due to a number technical limitations plaguing all chipmakers.  The second problem involves economics. It is more down to earth, but it is closely related to chip design and manufacturing. Bigger chips manufactured on relatively immature processes tend to be costlier to produce and develop. They usually face yield and leakage issues as well.  Thou shall not ignore Moore’s Law  The first technical challenge can be described as the thermal barrier. Simply adding more transistors and building massive chips with billions of transistors delivers more performance, but cooling these chips becomes troublesome and impractical. At the same time efficiency becomes an even bigger problem.  As an emerging field of IC design, bitcoin mining ASICs have experienced rapid evolution over the past two years. However, they cannot keep evolving and developing at the current rate. A number of technical limitations and Moore’s Law simply cannot be overcome even by the world’s foremost chip designers and foundries.  The same issues apply to multibillion dollar chipmakers like Intel, Qualcomm, Nvidia, AMD and various ARM partners such as Samsung, MediaTek and Apple.  Moore’s Law stipulates that the number of transistors doubles approximately every two years. Performance scales accordingly, but this does not mean that performance increases at a linear rate, as chip designers can optimise microarchitectures without piling on more transistors, hence yielding more performance from a the same number of transistors and chip area.  ASICs differ from general purpose processors and a lot less money goes into its development and optimisation. As it matures, optimisation gets more difficult. This means ASIC design will inevitably slow down.  Since most ASICs already use cutting edge manufacturing nodes and there is a limit to how big practical designs can be, more resources will have to go into optimisation, performance-per-Watt tweaks and state of the art cooling technology. This approach involves more spending and development than a transition to a new manufacturing process and it usually does not yield the same performance or efficiency increase.  ASIC designers tend to keep a lot of information away from prying eyes. ASIC makers reveal some basic specs, such as the number of processing cores and the size of the chip package, but they do not paint the full picture. The actual number of transistors and the size of the actual silicon in the package (die size) tend to remain undisclosed, although they are much more relevant than package sizes, voltages and other marketing-friendly specs. Since these are not mass market chips, they are unlikely to be taken apart and placed under a microscope so much of the information never becomes public, thus preventing in-depth analysis.  The problem for bitcoin miners is the fact that overinvestment is starting to create an unsustainable trend. Demand, caused by ever higher difficulty, is outstripping development. Ideally miners would need chips capable of breaking Moore’s Law and then some. Over the past year the hash rate of the bitcoin network has skyrocketed from around 1,000,000GH/s to more than 200,000,000GH/s, briefly peaking at 231,138,370GH/s in late August. In roughly the same period the difficulty shot up from about 65 million to 27,428,630,902 on 31st August.  Part of the increase should be attributed to new, more efficient and powerful ASICs, but in reality most of it comes from huge investments in this inherently risky industry. The old approach no longer works, as illustrated by hash rate trends in late August and early September. This is the focal point; this is where technology and economics intersect.  New technology will slow down the decline, but it won't stop it  Since Moore's Law is not going anywhere, the current rate of growth is unsustainable unless the price starts to pick up. It can be maintained through additional investment in industrial-scale mining operations, but only in theory. The days of high yields and ROI measured in weeks rather than months are over. Technological advances, including the introduction of more efficient ASICs and the transition to 14nm/16nm FinFET nodes have the potential to fuel further growth, but not nearly at the same rate.  Technology simply cannot evolve at a rate that would enable such growth in the long run without additional investments.  Thermals and efficiency are becoming a big problem. At a price of $500 bitcoin miners generate about $1.8m in revenue each day. If the price does not go up they could end up making even less. If it goes down, pulling the plug is another option, as miners will run their hardware at a loss for long. This figure does not include operating expenses, cost of capital and investments in next generation hardware. Energy costs are another constant. They are more likely to go up than down, forcing miners to migrate to regions with abundant, cheap electricity. Iceland and Scandinavia have already attracted a number of mining operations. This trend will inevitably lead to even more centralisation.  The cost of keeping the network running is going up, but the returns are not. Margins are going down, competitiveness is becoming increasingly important and small mining operations are unlikely to remain competitive in the future. This does not include just individual miners, but small mining companies as well. Therefore we expect to see more consolidation and diversification moving forward.  What the future holds  So will the network continue to grow more powerful? There is no straightforward answer as nobody can estimate the price of bitcoin over the next few quarters.  Should the price remain stagnant, we could even start to see a drop or at least a stagnation in the hash rate. The difficulty has gone up three times last month, going up from 19,729,645,941 to 27,428,630,902 in under 25 days. This represents an increase of more than 40%. Each increase was followed by a sharp (but brief) decline in the hash rate, which was compensated for in the days following each increase. However, the past two weeks point to a different trend.  The increase also indicates that many miners responded to the difficulty spike by pulling the plug on obsolete hardware, which itself is nothing unusual. However, the size of each drop is, as we are dealing with drops in the range of 20-25%. Big difficulty increases past the 20,000,000,000 mark clearly affected a large part of the network, rendering many miners obsolete overnight.  They were replaced by more efficient units that kept the hash rate up, but in turn they also increased the difficulty, creating a vicious circle that will claim even more obsolete hardware in the near future. This is nothing new, but data indicates the sheer pace at which the difficulty is going up is starting to have a serious effect on many miners. In the short term it will create market opportunities for the most competitive mining operations and hardware makers, boosting efficiency in the process. The risk is that the trend will claim too much obsolete hardware and put many miners out of business, resulting in even more centralisation and fewer incentives to invest in the mining space.  Michael Bedford Taylor, Bitcoin and the Age of Bespoke Silicon, 2013  About the charts  Mining hardware stats are notoriously hard to come by, so we used the most visible, crowdsourced dataset available, which is Bitcoin.it's mining hardware comparison data. We included miners that are listed as discontinued or currently shipping from the Bitcoin.it data. When there was no listed shipping date for a miner on the bitcoin.it table, we searched for shipping dates from publicly available sources, particularly miner's own websites or their posts on Bitcoin Talk. We excluded the three Minerscube miners because there is debate about the units' performance, as pointed out in the comments below.  Data and charts by Joon Ian Wong.

42377615,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72VG7,1410687627,Inside London's First Bitcoin Co-Working Space,"A unique co-working space has launched in east London, offering digital currency companies the opportunity to work side-by-side in an environment designed to promote growth and innovation.  Called T15B, the space is currently occupied by staff members of seven cryptocurrency-focused companies, including bitcoin trading platform BTC.sx and Australian bitcoin wallet and exchange CoinJar.  Co-founded by Pamir Gelenbe and his wife Gulnar Hasnain, who are behind the bitcoin events series CoinSummit, T15B is located close to London's tech hub – the so-called 'Silicon Roundabout’.  The space accommodates a corner of the 2,300sq/m office occupied by launch sponsor BoldRocket, which offers support to technology companies.  The décor is very stereotypically east London – exposed brickwork, bare light fittings and visible pipes on the ceiling, paired with clean lines and a few stand-out features such as a 'green wall' (an entire wall covered in live plants) and a large orange rocket sculpture.  Gelenbe said he looked at a few venues in the city, but the BoldRocket office really stood out as a place in which creativity would be bolstered.  Nurturing digital currency innovation  Gelenbe's aim for T15B is to offer a home for the best virtual currency entrepreneurs in Europe, creating an informal network of help and support.  ""I believe that we all end up outperforming when we surround ourselves with great, inspiring people,"" he added.  Gelenbe explained there are currently 18 people in the space, including members of Coinometrics, Proof of Work Media, XBTerminal, Bullion Bitcoin and Coinscrum.  He's looking to increase these numbers, but isn't willing to let just anyone join. He explained:  ""We don't want to compromise on quality. We have a selection committee and review applications on a rolling basis. We are looking for serious entrepreneurs and individuals who have demonstrated their commitment to the virtual currency space.""  Click below to view a gallery of pictures of T15B.  Motivation  Joe Lee, founder and CEO of BTC.sx, has been in the space since the beginning of this month having outgrown two Google TechHub offices.  ""Being surrounded by people working to disrupt the world of finance, through bitcoin, is incredibly motivating,"" he said.  Lee added he is enjoying working alongside other entrepreneurs that display an ""incredible amount of talent and knowledge"".  He believes London could become a world hub of bitcoin innovation due to its lengthy reputation as the finance capital of the world.  ""From an entrepreneur’s perspective, when a majority of the talent you are working with comes with financial services experience, you cannot fail to believe that London is going to be a city to watch out for,"" Lee explained.  Aleks Nowak, co-founder of XBTerminal, which helps businesses accept payment in bitcoin, agrees:  ""We have several of the best bitcoin startups based here now, the Bank of England and government seem to be changing polices to support the growth. We are in a very strong position to succeed.""  Mentoring  Gelenbe has co-founded a number of companies and is currently a partner at Hummingbird Ventures, a firm that has invested in bitcoin companies including Kraken as well as a number of other technology businesses.  He insisted he doesn't consider T15B a business venture, and is more interested in using the space to boost Europe-based cryptocurrency developments. With this in mind, Gelenbe has a very hands-on role in the office, acting as a mentor to the companies working there.  ""For me, this is an experiment. It's a community initiative that might succeed, but also might fail, we just have to wait and see,"" he said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2014/09/14/inside-londons-first-bitcoin-co-working-space,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6a98fd1fcec6a42edb1eababe8831c984144dda8-1280x848.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
