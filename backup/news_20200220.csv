42383317,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vDDR,1582233309,DeFi Insurance Firm Nexus Mutual Makes Its First Payout Following bZx Attacks,"Insurance works in crypto so far, though it hasn't had many big tests yet.      Not many people had insurance on assets locked up in bZx’s Fulcrum, but after a bug yielded an exploit of its smart contract, a couple of accounts that did were covered by Nexus Mutual, the London-based crypto insurance company.      Nexus Mutual is an insurance company that works as a cooperative (as any company with ""mutual"" in its name does), so there's been lingering doubts that its members would actually pay out against valid claims. But after the post-mortem from bZx came out on Monday, two claims worth approximately $31,000 were paid out, according to the company.      ""It's never good that people are losing money because there's a hack, but we are able to prove that the system works,"" Nexus Mutual founder Hugh Karp told CoinDesk.      In a mutual insurance company, policyholders govern the insurance pool. In Nexus Mutual's case, that means actually voting to render a decision on each claim.      The money in the mutual account is actually held by the people who hold the Nexus token, NXM. So the question has been: Will people vote to pay out of what is their pool of money when a valid claim gets filed?      Nexus did so, but only on the second try. The company detailed its logic in a blog post Wednesday.      Lasse Clausen, a founding partner at 1kx Capital and early backer of Nexus Mutual, is very happy the policies were honored.      ""I do think it's important that the mutual pays out so that people actually trust it,"" Clausen told CoinDesk.      Nexus is a pioneer in insuring smart contract risk. Opyn recently launched a hedging option with similar benefits, but it has a higher collateralization threshold. Nexus, though it introduces more friction to policyholders, can likely provide policies more ""capital efficiently,"" Karp explained.      How Nexus works    Right now, people can take out policies against any valid smart contract on ethereum. The policies are just bets against whether or not the smart contract will fail in some way.      ""It's not like an indemnity contract, where we only cover the actual loss,"" Karp explained. That is, it doesn't work like most insurance that retail customers would be familiar with from the analog world.      In fact, a person doesn't even need to be a user of a smart contract to take out a policy. They just name an amount of insurance, a time period and a smart contract. Then Nexus gives them a price.      If an exploit occurs on a smart contract that mutual members agree represents a failure of the smart contract, then policies get paid out. In that way, it's basically a bet on the soundness of a product.      All voters have to stake NXM to vote. In order to make sure mutual members participate, voters get paid in new NXM tokens to participate. New token emissions are proportional to the size of the payout, and only those who vote on the winning side earn the new emissions.      Nexus is a venture-backed company, whose lead investors are 1confirmation and Blockchain Capital. At launch in May 2019, three million NXM tokens were created and parceled out to the company and its investors.      More tokens can be purchased on the site at any time but they become more expensive when Nexus has its insurance obligations well-covered. When more policies get taken out and the mutual needs more funds, the prices drop to entice new investors to join in.      After a vote, token stakes only get slashed if the Nexus Mutual board determines malicious behavior. Otherwise, voters just get their stakes back.      ""It's very hard to determine the difference between a difference of opinion and a malicious outcome,"" Karp said.    Two votes        It took two votes to get to the payout in the bZx case.      As soon as the attack was found, claims were made on the Fulcrum smart contract. Mutual fund holders voted those down because at that point it looked like attackers had manipulated the oracles Fulcrum looked at, which didn't count as a failure of the smart contract itself, in Nexus Mutual's documentation.      ""For the first attack, it's a smart-contract vulnerability, which they subsequently fixed. This is basically based on my opinion as a smart-contract auditor,"" Quantstamp’s Richard Ma told CoinDesk.      Then, on Monday, bZx released a post-mortem that admitted to a fault in its code, where a fail-safe failed. Once this was out, two claims were submitted – both second attempts from the prior round that had been rejected. These were both approved by token holders, as there was evidence of a failure of the contract itself.      Even without the bug, Ma said, the oracles remain a point of potential manipulation. As long as a smart contract can be tricked into thinking an asset is worth more than it actually is, an attacker could potentially borrow more than their collateral is worth.      ""Any DeFi project that uses some DEX as a price feed, the same thing can happen to them,"" Ma explained. ""We audit lots of different projects and it's definitely not easy for the projects to understand all the different ways they can be attacked.""      That said, Clausen of 1kx said ultimately the situation also illustrated the beauty of a crypto-style approach. ""That's the beauty of these on-chain smart contract systems, they immediately paid out. No shenanigans,"" he said.      Karp said Nexus is looking at ways to insure against oracle attacks as well as other uniquely crypto risks, such as from hacks on centralized exchanges.

42383329,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vDNV,1582230606,"Bitcoin's Lightning Network Is Growing 'Increasingly Centralized,' Researchers Find","Bitcoin's lightning network is growing ""increasingly centralized,"" making it more susceptible to attacks, asserts a new paper by security researchers.      Seen as a potential solution to bitcoin's scaling headaches, lightning is a payment network allowing for speedier and cheaper transactions. Partly to make lightning more robust, developers and researchers have been trying to spot holes in the network.      Released earlier this month, the paper ""Lightning Network: a second path towards centralisation of the Bitcoin economy"" (by researchers Jian-Hong Lin, Kevin Primicerio, Tiziano Squartini, Christian Decker and Claudio J. Tessone) concludes that lightning has an ""unequal wealth distribution"" with a smaller percentage of nodes on the network gradually accumulating a larger proportion of bitcoin (BTC).      Specifically, the researchers found that 10 percent of the nodes control 80 percent of funds on the network. The situation, they caution, creates room for disruption. If most of the bitcoin is held mostly on a few nodes, this could make the network more vulnerable to attacks because removing these routing nodes would leave gaping holes.  ""Removing hubs leads to the collapse of the network into many components... suggesting that this network may be a target for the so-called split attacks,"" potentially leading to lightning being divided in half.      To be sure, engineer Christian Decker, a lightning engineer at bitcoin tech startup Blockstream and one of the paper's authors, said he is not worried about this state of affairs lasting.      This trend toward centralization is ""likely temporary,"" he tweeted. He and other lightning developers are ""working to make it easier for operators to build redundancies into the network.""    Rise of the middlemen    The researchers analyzed how the global network of nodes used for sending payments from place to place has evolved over time, by combing through a series of snapshots of the network over a period of 18 months.      On the lightning network, a payment might need to hop across several nodes to reach its destination. Most nodes passively sit at the edge of the network to send or receive a payment.      But ""routing nodes"" in the middle are doing the heavy lifting of passing payments across the network on behalf of others. If they want, they can charge a small fee for their services.      The researchers looked at these intermediary nodes and found a smaller portion of them are starting to shepherd a higher percentage of payments.    Barriers to entry    Decker added that it's not surprising more casual users aren't running routing nodes on the network.      ""We can't (and shouldn't) force users to invest the time and effort to run a routing node in the network, the best we can do is lower the barriers to do so, and maybe automate. We're not there yet, it is not very surprising that most stable nodes are run by few tech-savvy people,"" he tweeted.      But he hopes running a routing node is at least easy enough for a power user with some extra timwe to set up without racking up major expenses.      ""As long as a hobbyist with some knowledge can set up a node and actively compete with the other operators in the network, I think we have achieved our goal,"" he added.    Poking holes    In a similar what-could-go-wrong exercise, Hebrew University researchers released a paper this week showing how to execute a ""congestion attack"" on the lightning network, making it tough to send payments.      This hypothetical attack costs only about $4,000 at press time to significantly disrupt the network.      ""Our results show that it is possible to disrupt the Lightning Network by locking most of its liquidity using less than half a bitcoin,"" the paper reads.      Broadly, Decker sees this type of research as an important part of hardening the payment system.      ""We believe in publicly discussing both upsides as well as downsides of our protocol, and the network. Only this way we [can] make progress,"" he wrote. ""Anything else would be marketing, and that's not the business we're in.""",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | RESEARCH,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/02/20/bitcoins-lightning-network-is-growing-increasingly-centralized-researchers-find,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a6da28c34c55722b411178ca543d976de85dde21-1500x998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383324,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vDFx,1582227122,WATCH: Vitalik Buterin Explains the New Tech Behind Eth 2.0,"Where do things stand with the tech overhaul of the world’s second-largest blockchain?      We took the question to ethereum creator Vitalik Buterinat ETHDenver last weekend. Here’s what he had to say:      Eth 2.0 is the next iteration of the ethereum blockchain, incorporating novel protocol designs such as proof-of-stake (PoS) and sharding. Last December, Buterin released a blog post on ways to speed up the launch of Eth 2.0, which has been in the works for years.      PoS consensus algorithms reward cryptocurrency investors for holding the network’s native currency. Holding the currency validates blockchain transactions and protects the network itself. Eth 2.0 scientists expect sharding – a method of grouping ethereum holders together for transaction validation – to improve transaction speed on the network.      In the December blog post, Buterin described “stateless clients,” a method that changes the way current account balances, contract code and other information is stored on the network. Stateless clients work by mathematically proving this data’s existence and validity without storing all the data itself.      In other words, the Eth 2.0 blockchain would be lighter to operate.      “The clients basically do the same verification that it would normally do except it doesn't store the state,” Buterin told CoinDesk. “It just kind of grabs the state in real time and verifies it using [the client’s] Merkle proof.”      The project’s lead developers recently announced plans to launch Eth 2.0 as early as this summer. That launch would cover Phase 0 and the Beacon Chain, the first component to building out the new PoS blockchain.      As part of the switchover from the current Proof-of-Work (PoW) network, known as Eth 1.x, Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation have proposed running the current network on Eth 2.0’s skeleton until the latter is fully built out. Ultimately, Eth 1.x will exist as basically a giant receipt of pre-2.0 transactions.      “You can copy that state [Eth 1.x] and run it inside of a different Proof-of-Stake chain,” Buterin said. “The account balance and all the applications keep running as is, but the Proof-of-Work chain as it exists would be gone. And there would not even be two separate chains: Eth 1.x transactions and Eth 2.0 would all be in the same block.”",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MINING,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/02/20/watch-vitalik-buterin-explains-the-new-tech-behind-eth-20,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1a28f5918b478b384d59ac836a729554037e86be-1200x633.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to the Wall Street Journal, the consolidation will give Morgan Stanley an inroad with E*Trade’s 5.2 million retail investors in what will be Wall Street’s largest deal since the 2008 financial crisis. The bank is targeting this market, though Morgan Stanley’s current $2.7 trillion in assets under management dwarfs E*Trade’s mere $360 billion.      Despite lagging in assets, E*Trade’s client base is far larger than Morgan Stanley’s three million. But it’s also a different share of the investments landscape; while Morgan Stanley mostly appeals to high-dollar and institutional investors, E*Trade’s zero commission structure brings in more consumer-level, retail accounts.      It may also bring the wealth management giant closer to cryptocurrency markets. E*Trade reportedly toyed with launching a bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) trading platform in April 2019. That service could now get wrapped into Morgan Stanley’s, though there’s no word yet on what that would look like.      This all-stock deal will grant E*Trade shareholders 1.0432 Morgan Stanley shares for each of theirs. It still needs shareholder approval.      Morgan Stanley previously trialed an IBM blockchain-based payment netting service in late 2018.

42383320,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vDCB,1582219800,You Are the Product: A Three-Step Plan to Take Back Control of Personal Data,"Entrepreneur and investor Jennifer Zhu Scott is a council member of The Future of Blockchain Council at the World Economic Forum and holds a dual fellowship with the APAC Program and the Digital Society Initiative at Chatham House. She is also a consultant to the HBO show “Silicon Valley.”      Let's state a simple fact. Your traits and intimate personal information, such as your relationships, location histories, sexual orientation, genetic details and your children's images have become business assets. But they are not yours. They are recorded in digital form and centrally controlled, owned, stored and repurposed for often outsized profit by a handful of corporates. What is the accurate characterization of your function to those companies? We've all heard this statement: “If you are not paying for the service, you are not a customer. You are the product.” But that may not be quite right. Shoshana Zuboff, the author of ""The Age of Surveillance Capitalism,"" says ""Actually, you are not even the products. You are just the raw materials.""      Facebook carefully crafts algorithms to manipulate and exploit our vanity, greed, fear, insecurity, loneliness and dopamine, so billions of users, especially psychologically vulnerable youth or elderly people, will keep supplying raw materials for free. We are paying for the smartphone in our hands and the bandwidth to access the internet. It costs us time and attention and risks our mental wellbeing. We think we own our content, yet tech titans like Facebook, Google and Tencent milk it to target us for a fatter margin.      Obviously, it is easy to point out the problems. I intend to identify and create some solutions. Building on a TED talk I gave last December (see above), here are three ways we can change the power dynamic.    Step 1: Awareness    When we rushed to Facebook and Google in the early days, we were so excited about the capacities of technologies we neglected to think through the consequences. Digital Economy 1.0 is a failure at protecting our privacy and well-being. The Facebook/Cambridge Analytica scandal was a rude wake-up call for us all. Public concerns over privacy, political implications and generational psychological damage have been growing ever since. But there are still too many of us relying on monopoly “services.” We need to understand (then help everyone around us to understand) how important it is to support the alternatives, even if they don't function as well for now. Remember, Google is not indispensable; a search engine is. Google merely has a monopoly.    Step 2: The economic value of our personal data    We need to value our data properly. That doesn’t mean looking at the price on the open market. It means looking at the value created for the most data-savvy companies in the world. The combined revenue of Alphabet, Facebook and Tencent in 2019 was $284 billion. We live in a world of extreme, concentrated ownership of the most valuable asset of our time. We all have a job constantly contributing to these companies in every second of our digital life, but few of us are paid. To regain our digital freedom, it takes every one of us to realize and demand the economic value of our data and stop giving our data away for free.    We live in a world of extreme concentrated ownership of the most valuable asset of our time.    European regulators led the way to implement the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) giving individuals more control of their data. It is a meaningful starting point in bringing transparency and protecting individual privacy. But now what? While regulations like GDPR set a floor, the personal boundaries between the self and others cannot and should not be defined by regulators. Regulations alone can't solve the data ownership inequality problem. But everybody can get behind getting paid for our contributions. By creating value out of personal data and giving it back to individuals, we can reduce inequality and perhaps even fund a universal basic income in an AI-driven economy.    Step 3: Create privacy-centric solutions    Brave is challenging Chrome, Telegram is up against WhatsApp and DuckDuckGo has Google Search in its sights. Apple is differentiating its business model against Facebook and Google by emphasizing it doesn't need to make money by selling its users' privacy. Many startups in the blockchain field, such as Ocean Protocol and IOTA, are creating privacy/end-user-centric solutions to redesign the data economy.      The failures of Digital Economy 1.0 are the opportunities for Digital Economy 2.0. I am working with a few like-minded people to allow individuals to be paid in dollars for viewing and sharing digital advertisements. Consumer awareness of privacy is growing fast, and so are the opportunities. Google was irrelevant 20 years ago. Who can say the data power dynamic can't be rewritten in the next 20 years by some gutsy but perhaps unknown entrepreneurs? It is up to the doers. I sense a new industry is forming right in front of our eyes.      Some may argue that data is valuable only when there is a lot of it. There’s no point monetizing it if only some individuals demand full ownership. That argument may have validity but it forgets that we have rights as digital citizens. Perhaps our generation is already a lost cause when it comes to digital privacy and freedom. But I don't want my children and their generation to repeat the same mistakes. We know better now. If we don't ride on this wave and this moment to challenge the data status quo, we might regret it for the rest of our lives. The task is urgent and opportunity immense. It is now or never.",NEGATIVE,IOTA,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | IOTA,Jennifer Zhu Scott,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/20/you-are-the-product-a-three-step-plan-to-take-back-control-of-personal-data,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b43ac74c144d3e5928804e1869ff6959f4f6f300-2560x1440.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42383330,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vDRH,1582219693,Oil Prices Are Now More Volatile Than Bitcoin,"For skeptics and traditional market investors, bitcoin (BTC) is synonymous with extreme bouts of price volatility. However, in recent times, oil has become a relatively risky asset.       The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price's one-month realized, or historical, volatility stood at 105.3 percent on Feb. 10, after having hit a four-month high of 119.6 percent at the end of January. Meanwhile, bitcoin's historical volatility recently dropped to 42.3 percent, the lowest level since September, according to Skew Markets.       Historical volatility measures how much prices have varied in the past and is calculated from the standard deviation of daily price movements of the front month futures price, typically for a 30-day period. It is stated in annualized terms.       However, it does not measure the direction and only tells us how the security's price is deviating from its average. So, with oil currently reporting a higher historical volatility than bitcoin, it seems safe to say that ""black gold"" has recently been more volatile than bitcoin.       WTI's volatility rose sharply from 38.7 percent on Jan. 6 to a high of 119.6 percent on Jan. 27. Bitcoin’s volatility has retreated in a steady manner from 66 percent to 42 percent in the four weeks to mid-February.       For comparison, the S&P 500 index's realized volatility increased in the last week of January and stood at 15.6 percent on Wednesday. Gold's volatility gauge doubled to 18 percent in the first 10 days of January before falling back to 10 percent earlier this month.       The spike in the oil price volatility was in large part due to two major news stories. First was the large price moves following increased U.S.-Iran tensions. On Jan. 3, the U.S. attacked an Iranian base in Iraq , killing a top military commander and injecting geopolitical uncertainty into markets. As a result, WTI rose from $61 to $64 in just two hours to 02:00 UTC. Prices rallied further to hit multi-month highs above $65 during the Asian trading hours on Feb. 8 after Iran retaliated by attacking U.S. bases in Iraq. However, the fear of all-out war quickly faded with wires reported zero U.S. casualties, sending oil prices as low as $60 on the same day.       Second was the continued sell-off in the following weeks as coronavirus fears had a major effect on market sentiment. WTI clocked lows near $49.50 two weeks ago before regaining some poise. At press time, a barrel of oil is changing hands near $54.40.       While WTI witnessed wild swings in both directions, the bitcoin market was relatively calm with a strong directional bias. The cryptocurrency charted a near straightline rally from $6,850 to $10,500 in the six weeks to Feb. 13. Hence, it's not surprising that bitcoin's historical volatility is lower than that of oil.       This is not the first time oil has been more volatile than bitcoin. As recently as the period from mid-September to mid-October, WTI’s historical volatility skyrocketed from 60.9 percent to 133 percent. Prior to that, however, bitcoin was consistently more volatile than oil.       Looking forward, bitcoin's price volatility may rise as whales, or addresses with balances ranging from 1,000 BTC to 10,000 BTC, have started accumulating coins. Thus, it's difficult to say if bitcoin would continue to witness less volatility than oil.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | COMMODITY | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/20/oil-prices-are-now-more-volatile-than-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0c067db3562a44c01587a0c499e83e24bc683dec-1000x760.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404049,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhE2r,1582218682,$100K in Early Prizes Looks to Lure the NFT-Curious to Decentraland,"Decentraland opened for gameplay on Thursday and anyone who thinks they might like it is better off playing now rather than later, because free stuff.      For regular gamers, Decentraland may be a new kind of experience, what they call a ""metaverse"" where different game properties can meet in a shared virtual world. There's a potential that it could evolve into a new platform for games and social experiences. And since it’s on the ethereum blockchain, the “stuff” in that world is transferable (and sellable) beyond it.      Either way, there's an estimated $100,000 worth of digital goods to be found for early explorers.      There will be 15 intro games set up in the virtual world to introduce players to Decentraland's mechanics. Players going through these games can get prizes and treasures from playing. These non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are tradeable for other kinds of crypto. As was seen most famously with the game CryptoKitties, those tokens can go up in value.      ""It's the first virtual world that's based on blockchain technology,"" Federico Molina, Decentraland's head of marketing, told CoinDesk. ""I think you will be able to make a profit by playing. It's something new in that regard.""      Earning free crypto or items for playing will probably persist on Decentraland, but as in so many other things in this space: the early incentives are very likely to be the most generous.      Among the items on offer: a bunch of MANA (Decentraland's money), NFTs from a bunch of projects, such as CryptoKitties and Axie Infinity, items specific to Decentraland, 25 parcels of actual real estate within the game (more on that later) and even an HTC Exodus phone.      Decentraland has the resources for profligacy. It is one of that fortunate category of initial coin offering (ICO) startups that ran its token sale before the 2017 bull run really got going. (Of note: One of Decentraland's most enthusiastic investors is CoinDesk's parent company, Digital Currency Group.)      It raised $25 million selling 40 percent of the total supply of its MANA ERC-20 token, according to Molina, during a part of the year when ETH ranged from about $200 to $400.      Not long after, ETH would be trading at over $1,000, giving the company a great deal of budgeting latitude.      Olive Allen is a grassroots entrepreneur in NFTs, and she's both hopeful about Decentraland and frustrated about how much money it grabbed to launch. The least expensive parcel for sale as of this writing costs over $600 in MANA, making owning any chunk of the space prohibitive for regular people and creative types who might make the most use of it.      ""I think Decentraland has a bright gambling future – Vegas in VR – but due to barriers of entry the company created while chasing profits it closed its doors to culture and creativity,"" Allen told CoinDesk via text message.      She compared Decentraland to San Francisco, a place that used to be great but got too expensive and drove all the cool people away, she wrote – ""an attractive cultural center turned into a run-down soulless town.""    What is Decentraland?      Decentraland is a 3D world that people can navigate as they do in popular video games such as Fortnite or Call of Duty, except players both explore and build the world, like Minecraft but with money on the line.      ""It's something really shiny. Something really new that hasn't happened before,"" Molina said.      Theoretically, players will be able to do it with virtual reality equipment, too, but because demand for that medium has not been as high as many had hoped, Decentraland is not prioritizing these features.      Unlike other games, the 3D space represented into Decentraland doesn't have one coherent narrative over all of it. There are districts that people can go to in order to have certain kinds of experiences (such as looking at art, playing fighting games or gambling). The theory here is that people who have other digital experiences could build additional experiences in Decentraland.      Obviously, there's nothing stopping teams from creating their own digital worlds, but if they build it in Decentraland, that presents an opportunity for discovery. Decentraland players might find your property in the game and become big fans. Some 24,000 people have had access to the beta up to now, Molina told CoinDesk.      There are also themed districts set up in the game-world organized around specific kinds of themes. It being crypto, one whole district is devoted to gaming, and Decentraland has already announced a mega-casino location.      Play-to-earn is a model that shows traction in crypto. War Riders distributes its token, BZN, algorithmically, to players as they play the game.      So real estate really is on the blockchain, after all?    Sort of, yes, but the digital kind.      There are three kinds of tokens in Decentraland, MANA (the money), WEAR (wearables and items) and LAND (actual property). Early players are likely to find examples of the first two, though all of the latter is spoken for.      Players of the game can own virtual land inside it. Like in the real world, they can sell it or lease it out. Also like the real world, in certain parts there will be rules on how it can be used. Yes, zoning restrictions have already shown up on the blockchain.      The world of Decentraland has a fixed size, made up of 90,601 parcels of land. About 80 percent of that land is in private hands, with some portion usually for sale or rent on Decentraland itself.      There is land that no one owns, such as roads and plazas. A player moves between parts of Decentraland by walking their character along these common spaces.      Because people move around the space in a way that's similar to how people physically move, location matters. Parcels located near more popular spaces will be worth more than those located near less-popular spaces.      Location is still everything, even for property that only exists on ethereum.        How decentralized is Decentraland?    Molina argues it’s being decentralized in every possible way. For example, there's not going to be any kind of traditional username/password login. Users log in with their ethereum wallets.      Identities will be tradeable, so Decentraland has a small fee for making a name (100 MANA) in order to discourage name squatting, though an identity is not required to play.      From land itself to wearables in the game, most of the trade in Decentraland occurs on its marketplace. When sales occur, a small fee of MANA (2.5 percent) gets burnt, Molina said. This should nudge up the price for all MANA holders, and the Decentraland creators are major holders. This is their business model. ""It's like making the MANA holders as successful as possible. It will be adding value to the stakeholders,"" Molina said.      The team is actually looking to cede control of everything (including the question of whether or not MANA remains deflationary) to the community, by creating a DAO to govern all the rules in the virtual world.      ""I think what we've seen for now is like the tip of the iceberg,"" Molina said. ""When we start adding real utility to the NFTs – not just the collecting utility, like you'll be able to use it inside games, I think that's where it will begin to fly and lift off.""",POSITIVE,ETH | MANA,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MANA | TOKEN SALE,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/02/20/100k-in-early-prizes-looks-to-lure-the-nft-curious-to-decentraland,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a591537325e4853e5bff69cc7b1d6679af750151-1500x822.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

First noted by George Washington University's Seamus Hughes, the complaint, unsealed Wednesday, charges Pedro Antonio Aquino-Eufracia with conspiracy for allegedly participating in a drug cartel, laundering funds using a combination of cashier's checks and cryptocurrencies.      According to the filing in the District Court for the Southern District of Florida, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Special Agent Drew Gizzi alleged Aquino-Eufracia was part of ""a large-scale, international Money Laundering Organization"" (MLO), with individuals based in New Jersey, Florida, the Dominican Republic and other unnamed locations.      ""The investigation, including a review of lawfully obtained mobile communications and other electronic evidence, has revealed that on at least two occasions in April and May, 2018, Aquino-Eufracia agreed to accept large sums of cash drug proceeds from [a co-conspirator] and then converted the cash into virtual currency,"" Gizzi said.      The document noted that ""bitcoins are generated and controlled through computer software operating via a decentralized, peer-to-peer network,"" and that bitcoin primarily exists ""as units of an internet-based form of currency.""      ""A high-ranking member"" of the organization allegedly told Aquino-Eufracia to deposit the undisclosed crypto into specific wallets, with the organization hoping to obfuscate the details of the cash proceeds.      The complaint did not specify a dollar value for the crypto allegedly used to launder the funds or which cryptocurrencies were used, although bitcoin (BTC) was included.      According to Gizzi, law enforcement officials seized nearly $200,000 in dollars from co-conspirators in July 2018. Overall, he alleges that ""millions of dollars in cash drug proceeds"" have been laundered.      An arrest warrant for Aquino-Eufracia was signed by a federal judge in New Jersey on Feb. 14 and sealed until Feb. 19, following his arrest. In addition to the DEA, the Internal Revenue Service's criminal division participated in the investigation.

42404045,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhDyv,1582209000,"Never Mind Hodlers, Crypto Needs More Opportunist Investors","Jeff Dorman, a CoinDesk columnist, is chief investment officer at Arca where he leads the investment committee and is responsible for portfolio sizing and risk management. He has more than 17 years of trading and asset management experience at firms including Merrill Lynch and Citadel Securities.      Carl Icahn is famous for moving in and out of asset classes. This is quite different than how most asset managers and professional investors invest, who are generally locked into an asset class based on specific mandate, and are therefore forced to try to make something out of whatever is available to them, even if the opportunity set isn’t great. While some may label Icahn an activist investor, or a vulture investor, he’s actually more appropriately labeled as an “opportunist,” which is to say he isn’t just an equity guy or a bond guy or a real estate guy. Icahn has famously said, ""My investment philosophy, generally, is to buy something when no one wants it.""      The crypto markets to date have been dominated by crypto-native investors. There is very little cross-asset ownership largely because the infrastructure is totally different. Crypto investing doesn’t fit with traditional investor mandates, nor does it fit within the work flows of traditional banks, prime brokerages, exchanges or algorithms. This is slowly changing with the entry of traditional financial powerhouses to the digital assets space like Fidelity, CME and NYSE, but this asset class is still largely foreign and unappealing to the majority of investors.    Crypto needs investors to come and go who aren't solely crypto investors.    That said, a lack of full attention has its advantages. When one isn’t focused day to day on the equity markets, it is often easier to see one or two data points, interpret the data and make clear and objective decisions. For example, 2019 earnings were incredibly weak, and the majority of stock gains were via multiple expansion and central bank balance sheet growth. As a non-equity investor, this seems like a better time to sell than buy.      Similarly, if you’re not focused every day on digital assets and were presented with just the facts right now regarding supply and demand, adoption and monetary policy, you might conclude the current macro environment is creating the perfect storm for owning certain digital assets. We see this dynamic play out all the time in traditional markets. In 2008, many value investors moved away from equities and into corporate bonds, and distressed debt investors largely moved into bank debt and mortgages. In 2012, many U.S. bond investors moved into European bank loans. And from 2015 to present, just about everyone has rotated into equities.      Similarly, crypto needs investors to come and go who aren't solely crypto investors. This asset rotation and opportunistic investing will help the market find equilibrium at both market tops and bottoms, helping to reduce the crazy highs and the depressing lows historically associated with this asset class.      Easier said than done of course, but we are beginning to see this happen in real time. Those not in the market full time are starting to cherry-pick just like Carl Icahn. Ark Invest, which famously became the first public fund to invest in bitcoin (BTC), seems to be fund doing just that. A quick look at its latest 13-F filings show the firm has historically bought bitcoin on price dips (throughout 2018), sold at market peaks (June 2019) and has recently added back at market lows (December 2019).      Right now, crypto continues to largely be an isolated, and oft-ignored, section of the financial ecosystem. Perhaps the bitcoin carry trade (similar to the yen carry trade in 2013) will be one catalyst that brings new players into crypto, or maybe a declining bond and equity market will lead to asset rotations.      Regardless of how it happens, this will be the next step before digital assets can truly take off and become mainstream.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Jeff Dorman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/20/never-mind-hodlers-crypto-needs-more-opportunist-investors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ebfb8138d2546ce9991a2f950eb0a6362856b3bd-2500x1667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404033,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhDl9,1582207200,"Paxos, Credit Suisse Claim First Blockchain-Based Settlement of US Equities","New York-regulated crypto startup Paxos, in conjunction with Credit Suisse and Nomura-owned broker-dealer Instinet, has claimed bragging rights for the first live blockchain-based settlement of U.S. equities.      Announced Wednesday, the Paxos Settlement Service has gone live, allowing for the simultaneous exchange of cash and a select number of U.S.-listed securities on Paxos’ own private version of ethereum.      Last year, Paxos Trust Company announced the pilot, involving Credit Suisse and Société Générale, would be given the green light from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the form of a coveted no-action letter.      “We spent years studying the groundwork to get the pilot running,” said Paxos Director of Securities Product Melayna Ingram. “Now it’s live and settling stock. We are calling it a pilot because we are approved to do this under a limited number of participants and volume and a limited list of securities that are permitted.”      The current pilot phase can run for 24 months and is limited to seven participants handling 100,000 trades per day. Société Générale is expected to be integrated and live by the end of this quarter, said Ingram.      It’s also the first time since the formation of the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) that U.S. equities are settling in an automated manner in an outside system.      ""This launch is remarkable on a number of fronts,"" said Luke Mauro, global head of operations for Instinet Holdings. ""Instinet has always been a proponent of new technologies and efficiencies, as well as alternatives. We're pleased to be a part of these 'firsts'.""      Most of the innovation in U.S. equities over the past two decades has been in trade execution and trading market venues, said Ingram. “The back office has largely stayed the same, running on mainframe codebases and involving a complex system of reconciliation, which is out of step with new technology.”      Building on this, Paxos said it will apply to the SEC in 2020 to become a fully registered clearing agency. Only seven such licenses exist in the U.S., and attaining one means Paxos can offer the new blockchain service to all broker-dealers to settle U.S.-listed equities.      Under the hood, Paxos is using a private blockchain network that is its own fork of the ethereum codebase, as opposed to using another enterprise ethereum client like Quorum, BlockApps or Besu.      Cash has to be held in Paxos custody accounts for delivery versus payment (DvP) and settlement finality to happen. The process essentially tokenizes the cash on reserve in the same way Paxos handles its PAX stablecoin.      “There's never any one-way settlement risk that our participants are having against each other. So they are able to then remove cash and get intraday liquidity from the cash that they received from settlement,” said Ingram.      Emmanuel Aidoo, head of digital asset markets at Credit Suisse, said in a statement: “Paxos Settlement Service introduces blockchain technology that’s compliant with regulations and allows us to take important strides towards evolving market structure and unlocking capital that is tied up in legacy settlement processes.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/20/paxos-credit-suisse-claim-first-blockchain-based-settlement-of-us-equities,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

The freshly inked licensing deal, announced on Wednesday, will see Juventus offer digitally rare collectible ""cards"" of world-famous players such as Cristiano Ronaldo on Sorare.      Sorare, which is based in Paris, France, provides a soccer team management game with digital cards – created with ethereum tech – representing players that fans can collect and trade. The firm told CoinDesk the cards represent non-fungible tokens (NFTs) based on ethereum's ERC-721 standard.      “We are very proud to have signed this agreement with such an Italian heavyweight,"" said Sorare CEO Nicolas Julia. ""We see this as a new key step in our vision to onboard the best soccer clubs from around the world and bring blockchain-gaming to football fans around the world.”      Other top European clubs have already joined the platform, including Atletico Madrid, Porto and AS Roma.      For each player, Sorare issues 1 ""Unique"" card, 10 ""Super Rare"" cards and 100 ""Rare"" cards. For the Juventus tie-up, Cristiano Ronaldo collectibles will launch on Feb. 20, with the same 111 cards to be offered.      The cards are used in Sorare's game to comprise five player teams, or can be traded in the secondary market. The firm said some of the Unique cards have fetched prices of over $2,000.      Juventus has a huge global fan base, in part thanks to a trophy cabinet stuffed with gilded metalwork. The team has won the European Championship two times, the Intercontinental Cup two times and has topped the Italian Serie A league 35 times.      This isn't Juventus' first foray into the world of blockchain. In 2018, the club launched a token that allowed fans to participate in polls, thus giving them more ""voice"" in the club's activities.

In an interview with a local business newspaper, Norwegian Block Exchange (NBX) CEO Stig Kjos-Mathisen said his crypto trading platform had successfully developed payment infrastructure that will allow customers on Norwegian Air to purchase tickets with digital assets.      “Everything is ready to go from our side”, Kjos-Mathisen said in the interview. NBX aims to roll out the new feature to Norwegian customers sometime later this year, possibly as early as the spring.      Kjos-Mathisen is the son-in-law of Bjørn Kjos, the founder and CEO of Norwegian Air, who has been involved in NBX since it launched in 2019. The plan has always been to use the exchange to offer cryptocurrency support for airline ticket purchases.      In September, one of the oldest banks in Norway acquired a 16.3 percent in NBX for a reported $1.6 million. The exchange opened for beta users last September and is now accepting general customers.      Founded in 1993, Norwegian Air Shuttle is the largest airline in Scandinavia and the third-largest low-cost airline in Europe. It flies to destinations all across Europe and North Africa, as well as selected cities in the Americas.      Following extensive cost cuts, the company reported its best-ever quarterly result last October, with a pre-tax profit of 2.2 billion Norwegian kroner (roughly US$215 million). The airline carried over 37 million passengers in 2018, its highest ever figure within a single year.      It is unclear so far which digital assets will be supported on NBX or for ticket payments. The founder's son, Lars Ola Kjors, is believed to have bought 3.5 million NOK ($404,000) worth of bitcoin (BTC) in 2017 before the cryptocurrency hit its all-time high of around $20,000.

Gox Creditor Claims by 71%,"The New York-based private equity firm Fortress has issued a ""premium"" offer to buy out creditor claims from the now-defunct Mt. Gox exchange.      In a letter said to be sent by Fortress Managing Director Michael Hourigan on Monday, the company said it was offering creditors with large claims a ""premium price tier"" on a first-come, first-served basis.      Although parts of the letter seen by CoinDesk have been obscured, the new Fortress offer represents 88 percent of creditors' account value – assuming a bitcoin (BTC) price at $9,800 – on the remaining 15 percent of the bitcoin found in an old wallet that now constitutes the Mt. Gox estate.      That means Fortress is now offering creditors $1,293 for every bitcoin, a significant 71 percent more than the $755 the firm offered just before Christmas.      Fortress defended the 12 percent discount it has now offered investors, arguing the price is fair considering the ongoing litigation from CoinLab and Tibanne, who are both suing for significant portions of the Mt. Gox estate. The cases, which are being heard in Japan, will likely rumble on for the next three to five years, the letter reads.      Fortress first made a proposal to creditors last summer when it offered $900 per bitcoin, which it claimed represented a 200 percent markup of the market price of bitcoin when Mt. Gox declared bankruptcy in 2014.      Fortress hasn’t said how much funding it has put aside for this particular offer. Once accepted by Mt. Gox creditors, payments will take three days to process.

42404050,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhE3q,1582196724,Bitcoin Traps Buyers With Biggest Daily Price Loss in Three Months,"View  Despite an $800 fall on Wednesday, bitcoin's broader trend remains bullish, with prices holding above the higher low of $9,075 (Feb. 4 low).  However, yesterday's bearish engulfing candle has shifted risk in favor of a drop to that level.  A move back above a short-term moving average at $9,800 could force sellers to reassess their positions.    Bitcoin (BTC) took its biggest daily fall in three months on Wednesday, potentially trapping the bulls on the wrong side of the market.      Prices were rejected near $10,300 during the U.S. trading hours and fell sharply by $800 to levels near $9,300 in the 30 minutes to 22:00 UTC before closing the day near $9,600 – down over 5.5 percent on the day. That's the biggest single-day drop since Nov. 21, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).      Bitcoin fell by nearly 6 percent from $8,600 to $8,085 on Nov. 21. Since then the cryptocurrency has had 44 down days, although the losses have been largely moderate.      As can be seen above, bitcoin has dropped by more than 3 percent in just 13 days in the last 4.5 months and in five days so far this year. These numbers, when taking into account bitcoin's solid rally from $6,850 to $10,500, indicate market sentiment has been quite bullish since the start of the year.      As a result, Wednesday's 5.5 percent slide could be referred to as a bull breather or pullback. The slide was expected following the confirmation of the golden crossover – the bull cross of the 50- and 200-day MAs – on Tuesday. The golden cross is a lagging indicator and often marks temporary market tops.      Bitcoin, however, rose back above $10,000 on Tuesday, seemingly opening the doors for a re-test of the recent highs above $10,500, only to plunge again. As a result, Wednesday's drop may have trapped some buyers above $10,000.      That said, the broader trend is still in the bullish zone with prices holding well above key support near $9,100. At time of writing, bitcoin is changing hands just below $9,620 on Bitstamp, while its global average price, as represented by the BPI, is seen at $9,626.    Daily chart    Bitcoin has printed a series of higher lows and higher highs over the last two months. That bullish structure is intact despite the sudden price drop from $10,500 to $9,500 and would be only invalidated if and when prices find acceptance under $9,075, a higher low created on Feb. 4.      However, the risk of a slide to $9,075 has increased with Wednesday's losses, which have activated twin price-negative cues: a big bearish engulfing candle and a new lower high at $10,300 (marked by arrow above).      So, the bulls need to act soon by pushing the cryptocurrency above the descending five-day MA at $9,800. A sustained break above the short-term average may cause some sellers to rethink their bias.      A break above Wednesday's high of $10,300 would be a stronger confirmation of the continuation of the uptrend.    4-hour chart    Bitcoin remains trapped in a descending broadening channel, as seen on the candlestick chart (above left). Meanwhile, it has charted a head-and-shoulders pattern on the line chart (above right).      A break below the neckline support at $9,575 would confirm a head-and-shoulders breakdown and strengthen the case for a slide toward $9,000.      If prices again defend the 200-candle average at $9,400, the selling pressure would likely weaken, allowing scope for a stronger bounce.

National Stock Exchange of Australia owner NSX Ltd. and financial institution iSignthis (ISX), both publicly listed companies, announced Thursday they are forming a joint venture to offer a digital securities trading platform.      Called ClearPay, the new entity will offer a platform based on distributed ledger technology (DLT) and provide same-day delivery versus payment (DVP) settlement. iSignthis will integrate its ""know your customer’s customer"" security and other solutions with the platform.      The firms said they intend for ClearPay to compete with the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) – which is also building a DLT replacement for its outdated CHESS clearing system in partnership with blockchain firm Digital Asset – by providing same-day settlement solutions in an industry that traditionally takes up to three days to fully clear trades. The ASX is eyeing July for the start of industry tests of its new platform, which has been in the works for some years.      Thomas Price, acting CEO of NSX, said in a press release the market is in “broad agreement” that cash equity exchanges were facing a ""global technology revolution"" that is beginning to challenge legacy methods of clearing and settlement.      “Having patiently monitored the development of the appropriate technology ... we consider that this is the right time for the NSX to act,” Price said.      As part of the shareholders' agreement, ISX has invested A$4.2 million in NSX via a private placement. That brings the investor a 12.96 percent stake in NSX at $0.145 per share.      ClearPay is expected to go live ""by early 2021."" After that, the firms expect the domestic and international broker network to connect via the electronic data interchange standard ISO20022, and participate using an industry-standard blockchain.

Called PIX, the project from the country's central bank will provide 24/7 payments in up to 10 seconds via mobile apps, internet banking and ATMs, according to reports from Reuters and local crypto news site Livecoins on Wednesday.      Slated for launch on Nov. 10, 2020, PIX is aimed at speeding up and reducing the costs of fiat transfers between individuals and businesses.      At a launch event for the planned system on Wednesday, Central Bank of Brazil President Roberto Campos Neto said PIX is being developed as a response to new digital payments methods such as cryptocurrencies.      “PIX came from a need for people to have a payment instrument that is both cheap, fast, transparent and secure,” Campos Neto said, according to Livecoins. ""If we think about what has happened in terms of the creation of bitcoins, cryptocurrencies and other encrypted assets, it comes from the need to have an instrument with such characteristics.""      PIX will help cut costs by reducing the need for physical money, which the central bank chief said ""generates a great cost for society.""      At the launch, Joao Manoel Pinho de Mello, director of the central bank's Financial System and Resolution Organization, said PIX should be made available by banks to all market participants, payment institutions and other entities.      Mello explained that transactions using the system could be carried out by various methods, including QR codes or address keys – much like with cryptocurrency wallets and payments systems – or mobile numbers. Neither report indicates what technology PIX is being built with.      Among the possibilities cited at the event, PIX could be used to send funds to others, buy a cup of coffee, shop at online stores or pay a utility bill.

42404037,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhDq4,1582174800,"No, Concentration Among Miners Isn’t Going to Break Bitcoin","CoinDesk columnist Hasu is a pseudonymous crypto researcher publishing analysis for Deribit Insights and his personal blog.      A recent TokenAnalyst report claims a single entity could be in control of around 50 percent of bitcoin’s hashrate. The observation is based on the fact that five large mining pools have launched a new cloud mining service as a joint venture.      “In 2020, bitcoin has [...] become a highly centralized system that places an increasing amount of trust in a small number of large entities. Any centralization of bitcoin network hash power should be of concern as it erodes the trustless model of the network,” TokenAnalyst, a cryptocurrency research firm, says.      Its strong language is consistent with the folk theorem that bitcoin (BTC) relies on the decentralization of hash power to be secure. But is it also correct?    Concentration is inevitable    It is certainly true that one miner with 100 percent of the hash power would have more control over the network than miners with 10 percent hash power. A majority miner can reorganize the blockchain to double-spend his own transactions or even block any unwanted transactions from making it into the blockchain.      If a majority miner can misbehave and hurt users, does that mean users should try whatever they can to prevent centralization in hash power?      Former Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell sees that as a futile task, given that “[an attack] doesn't even depend on a single person having too much of the hash power. The attack would work just as well if there were 100 people each with an equal amount and a majority of them colluded to dishonestly override the result.”      This insight is important because it shows we can not rule out concentration, ever. Miners can always collude with each other and act as a single entity. It would be ludicrous to trust a system that can collapse after a single conference call – that’s all it would take to coordinate the behavior of the largest mining pools. And if miners could make more money by colluding with each other, we should expect that they will.    Rationality means agents do what is best for them, even if that means colluding with other miners to attack the system.    And – according to Maxwell – this problem might not have a solution because “any mechanism that would let you prevent one party (much less secret collusion) from having too much authority would almost certainly let you just replace mining entirely.”      So if the concentration of hash power in proof-of-work (PoW), or of stake in proof-of-stake, is inevitable, why am I not worried?    Concentration is harmless    The answer is that bitcoin’s design doesn’t assume mining power is widely distributed. It’s simply not a requirement. Instead, it only assumes miners are rational, which is something completely different. Rationality means agents do what is best for them, even if that means colluding with other miners to attack the system.      Satoshi addressed this matter directly in the white paper:    The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest. If a greedy attacker is able to assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favor him with more new coins than everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.    Let’s unpack this a bit. It is the incentive in the form of new coins and transaction fees that motivate the majority to “stay honest.” Satoshi realized the only way to prevent a “greedy attacker” from taking over is to make it more profitable to play by the rules than to attack the system.      This is the key to bitcoin’s assurances and at the same time the most widely misunderstood aspect of bitcoin’s design.      Economist Paul Sztorc even says he is “most comfortable just assuming that everyone is always in perfect collusion with everyone else. Specifically, that all of the hash power is actually owned and operated by one guy, whom we might call 'Mr. Greed.' [...] Why doesn’t Mr. Greed double spend, you ask? (He can reorganize the chain at any time.) Well, Mr. Greed prefers to keep all of the new coins for himself, rather than undermine the system (and the validity of his own wealth).”      I must admit, I was not comfortable with what I perceived bitcoin’s security model to be initially. If bitcoin were vulnerable the moment a group of colluding miners obtains 51 percent of hash power, how could we possibly monitor – let alone prevent – this? Moreover, why are smaller forks like [bitcoin cash] BCH and [bitcoin SV] BSV not constantly under attack, given that several individual mining pools in BTC control more hash power than their entire networks?      The dissonance disappeared when I realized that hash power concentration doesn’t actually matter. Bitcoin is secure not because it is impossible to attack, but because it is costly to attack.    The real cost of attack    The cost of an attack is directly related to how much hash power the attacker owns. That is the key finding of a paper I released with Curtis and Prestwich in 2019. In a simplified model, we estimated the present value of all mining operations in bitcoin at around 658,800 BTC or $6 billion at current bitcoin prices. (Consequently, 60 percent of hash power is worth around 395,000 BTC or $3.6 billion, and so on.)      The present value of these miners depends on the value of the network because their future profit is exclusively from block rewards. They are priced in bitcoin’s native token, BTC. If something happened to bitcoin that would make users lose trust in the system, these 658,800 BTC could lose their value in real terms, incurring a large opportunity cost.      Let’s say an attacker with 60 percent hash power decided to attack the network. If the attack depresses the price of bitcoin by only 10 percent, a rather conservative guess, he would lose $360 million in future profit. This is the opportunity cost of his attack.      This number – also called security margin – gives us an idea of how much an attacker has to be able to gain just to break even with his attack. And it does not yet include the ability for the other 40 percent of hash power to push back, or the ability of users to respond with their own nuclear option of changing the PoW algorithm.      The same logic has been replicated in the recent paper “Too Big to Cheat: Mining Pools' Incentives to Double Spend in Blockchain Based Cryptocurrencies” by Savolainen and Soria. The authors conclude that “the historically observed pool concentration does not indicate a higher risk of double-spending attacks. [...] This result demonstrates the well-known economic insight that feasibility does not imply desirability.”    Takeaways    Mining concentration is inevitable. Mining concentration is also harmless as attacks on bitcoin incur an opportunity cost that scales with the amount of hash power an attacker controls. An attacker with a lot of hash power would incur a large cost.      As a result, the system ensures miners with more control have a stronger vested interest in its protection as well.

The Korean bond market is one of the largest markets in Asia, according to financial data site Cbonds. The government regularly issues debt, which can be purchased by foreign investors. The country has rapidly become a regional leader with the advent of responsible bonds, such as green bonds, where issuances rose to more than $6 billion by June 2019, $2 billion ahead of China.      The BOK is said to have been inspired by the World Bank, which has raised a total of US$108 million through two bond sales held on a private version of the ethereum blockchain, together with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.      It's uncertain whether the BOK's proposed blockchain initiative would only be integrated with government-issued debt, or whether it could be expanded to include corporate debt as well. Similarly, it is unclear if the blockchain bond platform could be made to support a central bank digital currency (CBDC).      The BOK established a task force dedicated to researching CBDCs at the end of last year.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/20/south-koreas-central-bank-is-building-a-new-blockchain-system-for-the-bond-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/848292e49f71c3d118acb70088a7521eaeca4496-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
