42429463,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLz19h,1533330011,First Crypto Firm IPO on London Stock Exchange Raises $32.5 Million,"A crypto mining company has raised £25 million (about $32.5 million) through an IPO on the London Stock Exchange (LSE).  U.K.-based Argo Mining (ticker: ARB), which provides ""accessible"" crypto mining via a subscription service, is the first crypto company to be listed on the LSE. The company raised £5 million (about $6.5 million) more than its initial goal of £20 million through the IPO.  Argo kicked off on the exchange with about 156 million shares accounting for 53.2% of its issued shared capital, according to a company document. Shares were priced at 16 pence, giving the business a total market valuation of £47 million pounds (about $61.2 million).  ""Argo's admission to the London main market is a major step in the company's development and will put us in a strong position to execute our long-term growth strategy,"" executive chairman Jonathan Bixby said in the document. ""We are delighted with the strong response from investors which will enable us to grow our business in multiple jurisdictions.""  The company won approval from the UK Listing Authority in May to be listed on the exchange, and subsequently released its crypto mining subscription service in June. According to its website, Argo offers consumers three packages differentiated by the capacity of the mining power provided. BTG, ETH, ZEC and ETC are currently supported. All of its packages are sold out.  Bixby told the Financial Times around the time of the release that Argo wants to be ""the Amazon Web Services of crypto.""  ""More than 90 percent of crypto mining is done by elites on industrial scale because it is technically very difficult to do,"" Bixby was quoted as saying. ""It is incredibly expensive to buy, up front, the hardware you need at $5,000 a machine.""  Several other mining companies in the space are also considering IPOs.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, market leader Bitmain is rumored to be conducting a pre-IPO funding round and to be considering going public. Two other China-based mining hardware makers, Canaan Creative and Ebang Communication have both filed IPO applications with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

While bitcoin's price spiked 12 percent on the crypto data site, other coins saw more drastic increases. The price of aeternity, the eighth most valuable cryptocurrency, increased more than 951 percent, while MOAC increased by 905 percent and bitcoin diamond saw an 876 percent jump on the site. The site's exchange tracker feature was also affected, and falsely indicated that bitcoin was trading above $73,000 on some exchanges.  While crypto Twitter speculated about potential price manipulation, bugs and hacking, CoinMarketCap told CoinDesk that the inflation was caused by a data error.  ""There was a price calculation error on tether which caused any listing with a tether market to become artificially inflated,"" marketing vice president Carylyne Chan said in an email.  While most of the data appeared to have normalized at press time, the 24 hour change percentage for VeChain's VET token was listed as a question mark and its price graph was unavailable on the home page. The VeChain page also had no historical data listed.  The popular analytics platform has promised to release a ""post-mortem"" with further details in the near future.  The data error comes just two days after CoinMarketCap launched a new professional-level and fee-based API, including an updated exchange ranking page and the addition of derivatives markets to the site. In July, the site said it planned to introduce new filters and ranking metrics to address what it called ""concerns"" over fake volume figures.

The Ethereum Name Service (ENS), which allows ethereum users to replace long addresses with ""human readable names"" attached to a .eth domain, has partnered with Minds + Machines Group (MMX), a company that owns and operates ""top-level domains"" within the internet's Domain Name System (DNS) (others include .com or .uk, for example).  Announced on Friday, the collaboration means ethereum users will be able to register their addresses with MMX's soon to be launched .luxe domain, which stands for ""lets u xchange easily,"" offering a more user-friendly way to access the blockchain's assets and services like dapps and smart contracts.  Likewise, MMX said the .luxe addresses will allow ""names to resolve over the internet in the normal way for email or web-based traffic,"" enabling users to conduct ""traditional internet activity"" with the same address used for their ethereum assets and services.  ""We're very excited to be helping advance integration between existing DNS-based name services and the Ethereum Name Service, improving usability for blockchain applications and users,"" ENS lead developer Nick Johnson said in a statement.  He added in an email that the ""natively 'blockchain enabled'"" .luxe domain will offer ""more choices of domain and of trust model"" for ethereum users, and that the partnership ""improves integration between the legacy DNS space and blockchain technologies.""  MMX is confident that sufficient demand exists for .luxe, and pointed to ENS' success as evidence.  ""We already know from ethereum's test in its .eth zone that there is a real proven demand for word-based identifiers that are blockchain enabled,"" CEO Toby Hall said in the statement.  Launched in 2017, ENS features ""an automated registrar that allows anyone to register domain names ending in '.eth'"" via an auction. As previously reported by CoinDesk, identifiers foundation.eth and exchange.eth were claimed for about $27,000 in ETH and $609,000 in ETH respectively in 2017.

When asked if the charter applications could include those from cryptocurrency and blockchain startups, Bryan Hubbard, OCC public affairs officer, told CoinDesk in an email:  ""Rather than focus on a particular technology, the eligibility for applying for a special purpose national bank charter is predicated on the company (or proposed company) engaging in at least one of the three core businesses of banking – taking deposits, paying checks, or lending money. To the extent that a company performs one of these activities, they would be eligible to apply.""    The decision was made after almost 2-years of deliberation that included two public comment periods and conversations with hundreds of stakeholders, he noted.    The New York DFS is notably the body that governs cryptocurrency firms in the state and somewhat controversially developed the ""BitLicense"" framework for approving and registering crypto startups.  The agency has been criticized for setting a perhaps too-high bar for exchanges to operate in the state and to date only five companies have been issued a BitLicense, with the latest being Genesis Global Trading in May 2018.  The other four firms to be licensed in New York are Circle, in 2015; XRP II, a Ripple subsidiary, in 2016; and Coinbase and bitFlyer in 2017.

Called Bakkt, the platform will leverage Microsoft's cloud to build ""an open and regulated, global ecosystem for digital assets,"" according to a press release. Effectively, it will allow consumers and institutions to trade, store and spend digital assets over a worldwide network.  Notably, ICE also plans to offer a one-day ""physical"" bitcoin futures contract – meaning bitcoin is actually delivered on a specified date, unlike other offerings that are settled with cash. The product is expected to launch in November, pending U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approval, ICE states.  The company said that it believes that the regulated venues will create new protocols for managing ""the specific security and settlement requirements"" of cryptocurrencies.  The firm adds that major companies including BCG, Microsoft and Starbucks are providing expertise on risk management and consumer experience for the project.  Starbucks will also work to develop ""practical, trusted and regulated"" applications for consumers to convert digital assets into US dollars for use at the firm's outlets.  Jeffrey Sprecher, founder and chairman of ICE, said in the release:  ""In bringing regulated, connected infrastructure together with institutional and consumer applications for digital assets, we aim to build confidence in the asset class on a global scale, consistent with our track record of bringing transparency and trust to previously unregulated markets.""  ""Bakkt is designed to serve as a scalable on-ramp for institutional, merchant and consumer participation in digital assets by promoting greater efficiency, security and utility,"" said Kelly Loeffler, CEO of Bakkt.  The release also indicates that M12, Microsoft's VC arm, Galaxy Digital, Horizons Ventures, Alan Howard and Pantera Capital are among the firms who have either invested in, or are expected invest in, the project.

According to a blog post published Thursday, Coinbase Commerce – the startup's non-custodial cryptocurrency payment solution for merchants – has now launched a plugin for popular e-commerce platform WooCommerce.  WooCommerce, going by figures cited by Coinbase, currently provides the payments system for more than 28 percent of all web stores. However, the BuiltWith currently estimates the figure is slightly lower, at 21 percent.  Even so, the addition of the plugin (available on GitHub) now makes cryptocurrency payments via Coinbase to a good chunk of the web's e-commerce sites. It should be noted there are other similar plugins already available, such as CryptoWoo.  Coinbase said in the post:  ""This increased access will lead to more widespread adoption, and ultimately, moves us closer to our goal of an open financial system.""  The blog post also revealed that Coinbase now offers the option of sending of bitcoin and litecoin directly from Coinbase Commerce, with ethereum and bitcoin cash also in the pipeline.  The news comes just days after Coinbase opened up its exchange service to U.K. customers using pounds Sterling. It will now offer same-day deposits and withdrawals using the country's Faster Payments system.  And on July 2, the firm launched Coinbase Custody, a crypto storage service aimed at institutional hedge funds and other clients who can deposit holdings at a minimum of $10 million.

South Korea's Bithumb exchange – which suffered a $31 million hack in June – said in a blog post on July 31 that it will suspend the opening of new customer accounts from Aug. 1 as it is undergoing a ""service improvement process"" regarding so-called virtual customer accounts.  While the exchange did not give further details as to the reason for the suspension, a report from Business Korea on Tuesday cited banking industry sources as saying that the exchange was forced to into the suspension because its banking partner, NH Nonghyup Bank, has yet to renew Bithumb's contract following the hack.  Twenty-four-hour trading volume on Bithumb was around $350 million on Tuesday, according to archived CoinMarketCap data. Yet, over the past three days, volume has declined to around $200 million (as of press time on Friday), reflecting an over 40-percent drop.  The exchange has not responded to CoinDesk's request for comment on the trading volume drop and the banking issue.  While new accounts are suspended for now, Bithumb said that customers who already have identity-linked virtual accounts – effectively, sub-accounts that link individual users back to the exchange's bank account – can still use them for deposit and withdrawal services, the report adds.  Bithumb reportedly said it has a ""consensus"" with Nonghyup Bank on the renewal of the contract and is ""planning to iron out our different views on some legal expressions and start issuing virtual accounts soon.""  Should a final agreement not be reached, Business Korea states that Bithumb can still collect service customer deposits and withdrawals through what's called a ""hive account,"" though the option would be far less convenient for users.  Alongside the more negative news for the exchange, it also announced Thursday that deposits and withdrawals in 10 cryptocurrencies will be reinstated this coming Saturday, including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and XRP. The platform said the move comes after it had completed security checks and improvements after the June breach.  It further noted that, after observing a 10 percent disparity between prices on Bithumb and those on external exchanges, it will delay reinstating services for another batch of cryptocurrencies until prices stabilize.  South Korean regulators mandated the use of so-called real-name virtual accounts from the end of January over fears that the anonymous accounts permitted previously provided greater risk of money laundering.  Following recent hacks and other issues, the country is also moving to further regulate crypto exchanges, with a number of new bills being prepared by lawmakers across the political spectrum.  On July 26, an executive at the Financial Services Commission called on politicians to pass a bill regulating cryptocurrency exchanges ""as soon as possible.""

42429474,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLz1Th,1533294008,Bitcoin Eyes Short-Term Bear Market After Two-Week Lows,"Bitcoin's (BTC) price pullback from the recent highs above $8,500 is increasingly looking like a short-term bear market on the technical charts.  The leading cryptocurrency fell to a two-week low of $7,282 earlier today on Biffinex and was last seen trading at $7,350 – down 3 percent on a 24-hour basis.  The sell-off from the recent high of $8,507 had shown signs of exhaustion near $7,455 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the June low of $5,755) on Wednesday, raising prospects of a move higher to $8,000.  However, BTC did not find takers on Thursday and the resulting failure to capitalize on the signs of bearish exhaustion ended up encouraging the bears to push the cryptocurrency down to two-week lows as expected.  At press time, BTC has found acceptance below the key support of $7,455 and has retraced 40 percent of the rally from $5,755 to $8,507. What's more, the cryptocurrency also closed yesterday below the former resistance-turned-support of the 100-day moving average (MA).  As a result, BTC appears to have entered a short-term bear market. The price chart analysis shows the prices could drop further to $7,130.  Daily chart        BTC closed below the 100-day MA yesterday, adding credence to the signs of a short-term bearish reversal: a bearish crossover between the 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MAs) and a downside break of the ascending trendline by the relative strength index (RSI).  Moreover, the 100-day MA had acted as stiff resistance before it was taken out on July 23. It is worth noting that BTC rallied by $800 on the following day, boosting the 100-day MA's appeal as a key technical level.  Hence, the bears could be feeling emboldened, having cleared the 100-day MA support yesterday. Further, BTC has also dropped below $7,455 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement), which served as good support earlier this week.  And last but not the least, the relative strength index (RSI) has dipped below 50.00 (in bearish territory).  Clearly, the tide has turned in favor of the bears – at least for the short-term – and a further drop could be on the cards, albeit after a re-test of the 100-day MA of $7,583.  4-hour chart  The RSI is hovering below 30.00, indicating oversold conditions and the chart also shows a bullish divergence of the RSI. Hence, a minor rally to $7,583–$7,600 cannot be ruled out, although the gains will likely be short-lived, courtesy of the bearish setup on the daily chart.  View  Bitcoin's close below the 100-day moving average (MA) on Thursday has confirmed a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change and opened the doors to $7,130 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the June 24 low of $5,755).  A minor corrective rally to $7,600 cannot be ruled out, courtesy of the oversold conditions reported by the 4-hour chart.

42429467,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLz1Hh,1533290765,OKEx Confirms $9 Million Clawback After 'Enormous' Bitcoin Future Fails,"After a user made an ""enormous"" gamble on bitcoin futures, and lost, Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange OKEx said it is having to claw back millions from counterparties.  The exchange explained on Friday that it force-liquidated an ""unusually large"" long position of 4,168,515 bitcoin futures contracts held by a client on July 31 after the user declined the exchange's request to lower the position.  Each futures contract has a notional value of $100, according to OKEx, so the total value of the position was over $400 million.  The platform said it subsequently froze the user's account and initiated a forced liquidation.  An OKEx spokesperson told CoinDesk that, even with the force liquidation, the dropping price of bitcoin and the ""sheer size of the order"" mean it has had to trigger its societal loss risk management mechanism.  After its insurance cover is taken into account, the loss to investors is around 1,200 BTC (around $8,800,000 at press time), which will ""split proportionately by all profited traders' realized + unrealized gains,"" the spokesperson said.  OKEx said it had also injected 2,500 bitcoins into its insurance fund – worth around $18 million at press time – to limit the damage to traders.  A societal clawback happens when the platform's insurance fund is not able to cover investors' total margin call losses. In that case, counterpart investors – i.e. those who have short positions – will have to make up the shortfall.  ""When the insurance fund cannot cover the total margin call losses, a full account clawback occurs. In such case, only users who have a net profit across all three contracts for the week will be subject to the clawback,"" the exchange explained on Friday.

42401729,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2GXz,1533283244,G20 Crypto Regulations Could Unleash Real Blockchain Change,"Jonathan M. Padilla is a Schwarzman Scholar at Tsinghua University where he wrote the dissertation ""New Regulations for the New Economy: A Proposal for the G20 on the Regulation of Cryptocurrency,"" from which this article was adapted.  He has advised major e-commerce and natural resource companies on blockchain integration and has a background in government and politics.      In March of this year, G20 central bankers and finance ministers met in Buenos Aires to discuss everything from international trade to investment in global infrastructure. Among the topics covered was the regulation of cryptocurrency, which has attracted the growing attention of government regulators and political actors as blockchain adoption becomes more widespread and cryptocurrency markets gain a broader following.  Since then, the G20 has begun to intensely study ways to de-risk cryptocurrency markets and craft regulation that will not stifle the innovative potential of blockchain. While many entrepreneurs and investors in this space fear that compliance with government will hinder future growth, the reality is that engaged cooperation offers the best possible path toward a potential tipping point that accelerates adoption of blockchain technology by major enterprise-grade users and brings in far greater institutional investors.  With central bankers and finance ministers slated to discuss cryptocurrency this summer in Argentina and with the full G20 to meet in late November, action or inaction here will impact cryptocurrency markets. How the blockchain community chooses to engage between now and then has the potential to set the tone of how governments and entrepreneurs develop a long-term relationship.  As Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chair of the G20's Financial Stability Board, noted in March of 2018, blockchain has ""the potential to improve efficiency and inclusiveness of both the financial system and the economy,"" but unleashing this potential will require substantial work.  An ideal forum  The G20 was originally formed as a forum for finance ministers and central bank governors after the Asian debt crisis of 1997. It's since become a body for cooperation among heads of state to address challenging economic issues of the time.  In the wake of the Great Recession, the G20 created the Financial Stability Board to better coordinate prevention of and coherent responses to financial instability. Since its inception, the FSB has been critical to enhancing banking regulations through the Basel Accords, an opt-in transnational framework designed to strengthen the resiliency of global financial systems, and to promoting good economic governance policies.  The G20, along with the FSB, provides the best opportunity for a global regulatory framework as they 1) convene the most relevant stakeholders and decision makers, 2) can craft a framework that is transnational in scope, and 3) are already studying cryptocurrencies and their impacts to a number of different fields.  Any regulatory framework will require cooperation from heads of government who possess the political power to move legislation and balance domestic considerations, from finance and economic ministers who have the technical ability to craft good policy and execute laws, and from central bankers who have a huge impact on the regulation of commercial banking within their respective states.  Additionally, the G20 can ensure whatever framework does take shape is transnational in nature as issues such as tax evasion, money laundering, and investor protection transcend borders. Such a framework would also minimize the risk posed by regulatory arbitrage to nations where firms can exploit loopholes in order to gain advantages based on geography.  Lastly, with G20 member states and FSB staff already working on these issues, there is attention, focus, and a desire to craft policy that will not stifle innovation.  The agenda  Different nations have taken different approaches to the regulation of cryptocurrencies and related fields. While a comprehensive framework is likely years away, there are a few key points that stand out in crafting a regulatory setup.  The simplest issue that the G20 and FSB can mediate is deciding on a working definition of cryptocurrency. Several nations such as Switzerland through FINMA and Israel through the Israeli Securities Agency have taken steps to do this in a way that classifies cryptocurrency into payment tokens, utility tokens, and security tokens.  Clarity on this front will not be easy but defining cryptocurrency will allow entrepreneurs and investors much firmer ground on which to build projects and governments more guidance on how to regulate.  Accepting that all the information required to regulate does not yet exist is another important point. This thought lends support to the creation of sandboxes like what the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority is doing on fintech that will provide both flexibility and capacity to evolve to meet the demands of the industry as it matures.  On exchanges, the leadership shown by Japan, with the Financial Services Agency requiring licenses and working with self-regulating organizations (SROs) to help police the space and mainstream cryptocurrency should be lauded.  Exchanges will be critical to figuring out how banks interact with cryptocurrency and how taxes will eventually be collected. As the value of the cryptocurrency market increases more and more attention to know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) compliance will follow.  Industry impact  Collectively, some of the issues above could be woven together to mirror efforts that G20 has taken on banking regulation. A Zug or Valletta Accords, comparable to Basel, could create an opt-in framework where nations agree on basic tenets for regulating cryptocurrency with active input from the industry.  Increased regulation, however, will not mean that blockchain and cryptocurrency projects die. On the contrary, increased regulation, as long as it is done with the cooperation of industry stakeholders and with the aim of de-risking the broader market, will hasten blockchain adoption by large enterprise users and reassure institutional investors.  Numerous large firms have already begun to explore blockchain applications and potential use cases to streamline costs and gain a competitive advantage with their peers. With a regulatory framework in place, the internal and external compliance requirements of publicly traded companies can be met and the true growth stage of the traditional S-curve can begin.  Working with regulators, industry stakeholders can help craft rules where both entrepreneurs and governments win. Such a framework by the G20 could be just the action required to help unleash the long-term creative potential and promise of blockchain.

42401726,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2GW1,1533278028,Mt Gox Creditors Are Preparing to Claim for Bitcoin Repayments,"A group of creditors of the defunct bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox have started preparing to claim for bitcoin repayments following a court's decision in June.  Lawyers representing several Mt. Gox creditors – who filed a petition in November to move Mt. Gox out of bankruptcy and into a process of civil rehabilitation – on Thursday published an updated proposal for the process.  The lawyers released an initial basic policy for the rehabilitation on June 29, just a week after a court in Tokyo approved the creditors' petition for civil rehabilitation entered late last year.  The policy stated in June that it would be ""appropriate"" to repay creditors who deposited BTC and BCH with Mt. Gox in the same cryptocurrencies instead of cash.  In the latest update, the lawyers further asserted that it would be desirable that these ""BTC and BCH be sent to exchanges in which many creditors have accounts or can open accounts easily,"" adding:  ""We are of the opinion that most of the assets, including approximately 166,000 BTC and 168,000 of BCH and other derivatives currently held by Mt. Gox, should be paid to creditors at the time of the first payment.""  Those assets could be worth over $1.3 billion, based on latest data from CoinDesk's price index.  The revised policy stated that the first payments to creditors are expected to start in May or June 2019, if the rehabilitation plan can be approved, that is.  Currently, the lawyers representing the group of creditors are seeking further feedback before a formal rehabilitation plan can be finalized and presented to the court by February of next year.  In addition, the revised proposal stated that cryptocurrencies other than BTC and BCH held by Mt. Gox should be liquidated into cash and paid to creditors since their prices could fluctuate significantly and security risks may arise if they are moved around from wallet to wallet.  Mt. Gox, once the world's largest bitcoin exchange by trading volume, declared bankruptcy in 2014 after over 744,000 BTC were stolen. Subsequently, creditors went into a years-long process in a bid to retrieve their trapped funds.  Amid bitcoin's price spike to close to $20,000 late last year, a group of creditors filed a petition to the bankruptcy court in Tokyo to move the case into civil rehabilitation.  Mt. Gox's trustee was then holding 202,195 bitcoins and then liquidated over 30,000 of them into cash in March 2018. The court's approval of the civil rehabilitation petition means that Mt. Gox will no longer need to liquidate any BTC or BCH assets.  Nobuaki Kobayashi, the rehabilitation trustee, said in July that a new system for creditors to file proof for claiming repayments is expected to be released in August.

42401737,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2Ges,1533268940,"Data Shows US Dollar, Not Japanese Yen, Is Dominating Bitcoin Trade","Japan may not be quite the cryptocurrency powerhouse that the world thinks it is.  A deep dive by CoinDesk has found methodological flaws in widely-cited bitcoin exchange data that appear to overstate the importance of the Japanese yen as a trading pair. Our analysis of trading data collected from July 26-30 suggests that the U.S. dollar, not the yen, is the dominant currency traded for bitcoin by a wide margin.  Currently, analytics sites CryptoCompare and Coinhills offer a breakdown of bitcoin trading by currency pair, and until recently the data from both sites indicated that over 50 percent of bitcoin trading is denominated in Japanese yen.  The problem is that the vast majority of yen-denominated transactions are not ""spot"" trades of actual bitcoin for yen. Instead, they are derivative products: contracts that derive their value from the performance of an underlying asset.  In other words, the parties to these transactions are betting on the price of bitcoin, but no bitcoin is actually changing hands. While there's nothing inherently wrong with these contracts, selectively mixing derivative and spot volumes can paint a misleading picture.  Specifically, Coinhills and CryptoCompare, whose data has been cited by major outlets such as Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, did not distinguish between the spot and derivative volumes of Bitflyer, Japan's largest exchange. In other words, both types of trading were counted toward the total for yen-bitcoin activity.  However, their calculations did exclude equivalent dollar-denominated derivative markets such as those on Bitmex.  As a result, the yen and dollar totals were not an apples-to-apples comparison, since the former includes derivative trades and the latter does not. When correcting for the misclassification, the data compiled by CoinDesk paints a starkly different picture.  To be sure, Japan remains a global hotspot of cryptocurrency interest, thanks in part to a law that took effect early last year recognizing bitcoin as legal tender and regulating the country's exchanges. And the CoinDesk analysis covers only a five-day period, so it isn't quite conclusive evidence that the U.S. dollar underpins most cryptocurrency trading.  Still, after being contacted by CoinDesk, CryptoCompare changed its methodology, and its data now shows the dollar out-trading the yen.  Further, the inconsistencies in how different types of transactions are counted across exchanges, and the wildly different results when these are addressed, underscore the nascent state of the cryptocurrency industry's data practices.  Devilish details  As mentioned, the issues with currently available data stem from the classification of Bitflyer's various exchange markets.  Bitflyer handles both spot trades and derivative trades, but it is the sheer scale of these derivatives trades that can distort market data.  During the time period of CoinDesk's snapshot, Bitflyer's Lightning FX derivatives service processed the equivalent of nearly $2 billion in yen-denominated trades every day. These derivative trades accounted for 90% of CryptoCompare's observed yen trading and 85% of Coinhills' yen trading.  By itself, the inclusion of derivatives volume would not necessarily be a problem if CryptoCompare and Coinhills also counted dollar-denominated derivatives markets when tallying the total volumes. Trouble is, they don't.  For perspective, Bitmex, the largest dollar-denominated derivatives market, recently set a record of over $8 billion of contracts traded in a single 24-hour period (July 23-24), dwarfing Bitflyer's volumes. These derivative trades are uncounted in CryptoCompare's and Coinhill's respective measures of total USD-BTC trading.  To create a more balanced comparison of global trading activity, CoinDesk took a snapshot of both the spot market, which excludes all derivative trading, and the total market, which includes all spot trading and the dollar and yen volume at the four major derivative exchanges: Bitflyer's Lightning FX, Bitmex, CME and Cboe.  Both these measures indicate that the U.S. dollar dominates worldwide, with the yen a distant second.  For example, the dollar accounted for only 17 percent of CryptoCompare's tally and 21 percent of Coinhills' figure for those five days in July. In CoinDesk's apples-to-apples snapshot, by contrast, the dollar makes up 56 percent of spot market trading and 68 percent of total trading when including major global derivative markets.  Regulatory implications  The findings are notable as the spot market is particularly relevant to officials concerned about potential illicit uses of cryptocurrency.  Any unsavory actor attempting to make use of ill-gotten gains today must rely on spot exchanges to convert cryptocurrencies into fiat currency.  The dollar's role in this exchange ecosystem extends the reach of the U.S. government. Just as the dollar's preeminence in the international financial system gave U.S. regulators the leverage they needed to shape global anti-money laundering (AML) practices in the wake of 9/11, the dollar's importance in global fiat-to-cryptocurrency trade could give them outsized influence as governments around the world mull new regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies.  For example, Japanese officials have thus far led the push for global cryptocurrency AML standards in international forums like the G20 and the Financial Action Task Force, but continued dollar dominance of cryptocurrency trading could inspire a more active U.S. presence.  Yaya Fanusie, director of analysis at the Center on Sanctions and Illicit Finance at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and co-author of a report on bitcoin laundering, told CoinDesk:  ""If your assumptions are correct and the dollar in fact dominates on crypto exchanges around the globe, this data could prompt U.S. regulators to take a more active role.""  Data deluge  To be fair, the uncertainty, complexity and constant churn of the exchange market leaves analytics sites like CryptoCompare, Coinhills and others struggling to keep up. In such an environment, errors are bound to occur, even with data from large, highly regulated exchanges like Bitflyer.  When contacted about the inclusion of Bitflyer's derivative data, both CryptoCompare and Coinhills acknowledged that data from Bitflyer's Lightning FX derivatives market was the root cause of their observed yen dominance.  ""We do currently count Bitflyer's Lightning FX volume, and thank you very much for pointing this out. We plan on excluding Bitflyer's futures volumes from calculations at the end of this month,"" Constantine Tsavliris, an analyst at CryptoCompare, told CoinDesk.  Subsequently, CryptoCompare, which recently announced a data partnership with Thomson Reuters, indeed removed Biflyer's derivatives market data from its calculations.  A Coinhills representative stated that the company is exploring adding other major derivatives markets such as Bitmex.  While the industry continues to mature by the day, it remains the Wild West for all observers hoping to gather a clear image of the cryptocurrency exchange market.
