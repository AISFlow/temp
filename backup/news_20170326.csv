42379326,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87VdD,1490526056,How to Explore Blockchain,"Arno Laeven is a strategy and innovation consultant at Laeven Consult, and the former blockchain lead for global healthcare giant Philips.  In this CoinDesk opinion piece, Laeven offers his advice for organisations setting out to explore blockchain with a view to adoption, arguing that expectations need to be managed at this early stage of the tech.  Even though motivational speaker and author Simon Sinek has over 300,000 followers on Twitter, 80,000 on LinkedIn and his Ted Talk was viewed 30 million times and counting, most people still don’t do what he advises and start with 'Why?'.  So, when looking at blockchain tech for your organisation, why would you want to get involved in a technology which is immature, where the legal framework is unclear and where business models are still hard to come by?  Immature technology  To start with the technology, sure bitcoin has been around for eight years now, and works extremely well for what it was intended: managing electronic cash without a central administrator. Yet, demanding anything beyond that on the bitcoin blockchain is complex, if not impossible, due to limitations such as scalability, throughput and privacy.  So along comes ethereum which aims to be a decentralised virtual machine or a 'world computer' in the words of Gavin Wood, one of the project's founders. The absence of a central authority is the essence of a blockchain, but also a challenge when you want to ensure users that the machine is working properly.  Vlad Zamfir, one of ethereum's core developers, wrote a great posthttps://medium.com/@Vlad_Zamfir/about-my-tweet-from-yesterday-dcc61915b572%23.9l968wthb about the state of ethereum and why he thinks that we all should take care when handling such a powerful but immature technology.  I believe that blockchain exploration projects should keep as much 'off-chain' as possible, and only use a blockchain for whatever core functionality it may provide for your use case.  From a technology point of view, what you are going to explore will likely: a) be obsolete by the time you've built it (given the speed of development of the technology), and b) not have the full functionality of a blockchain, since you want to keep as much off-chain as possible  Unclear legal framework  Legal concerns are twofold.  First of all, current law and legislation does not fit the technology, as such.  Take, for example, the concept of controller and processor: who is what with regard to data on a blockchain?  The second issue concerns blockchains replacing and/or altering the concept of law – a subject about which Alan Cunningham of the University of Manchester School of Law wrote an interesting piece. In the article, Cunningham singles out for criticism the concept of absence of governance, which has proven not to hold up in crisis situations (as with failed ethereum project The DAO).  He argues further that the roots of blockchain are to be found in anarchistic and libertarian movements. My take is that one cannot embrace blockchains without embracing these world views too.  So, then the question becomes broader than law, it is a question of world view. Is a world without government and without central governance one in which you see your organisation functioning?  In other words, a choice for blockchain is implicitly also a choice for new forms of governance.  New strategy required  That brings me to the third point, that of strategy. Blockchains will alter the value chain and even the organisation itself. This has all to do with the organisation of trust which will shift when introducing a trustless system like blockchain as a foundational layer.  Take a look at your own organisation and identify the positions and departments created just to make sure that transactions can be trusted. Auditors, compliance professionals, in-house lawyers and managers are in most cases ‘just’ there for the reason of trust. What if they are no longer needed and what if the cost of transacting goes down and the ease of collaboration goes up?  Before addressing those fundamental questions, it's rather silly to be asking, 'What's the business model of the blockchain?', or 'What's its killer app?'.  Exerting influence  So why, for crying out loud, would you be interested in blockchain?  One reason – and it’s not the worst reason – is that your competitors are investigating the tech. FOMO, or fear of missing out, is very real, and the basis for many innovation projects and blockchain consortia.  A more intelligent answer, though, is that blockchain could be a technology, legal construct and strategy that profoundly impacts your industry and your company in the mid to long term.  So, why should you start exploring now? Because have the chance to influence the course the technology is taking, rather than being confronted by it in a couple of years' time.  Further, blockchain could possibly enable new revenue streams and lower operational costs. A blockchain exploration project therefore should be aimed at moving to deeply understand the consequences of blockchain on a technical, legal and strategic level.  Yet, carefully choosing the right use cases for blockchain will be paramount to the success of the project.

42379329,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87VjV,1490519732,'Scam Free' Gambling on Ethereum? Regulators Might Not Be Ready,"A world without gambling scams – that's just the latest big idea being tested on the ethereum blockchain.  While much of the news lately has been on the platform's increasing enterprise use, the project is still a predominantly open-source community, one fueled by the ideas and hard work of entrepreneurs the world over.  Take DAO.Casino, a project based in Russia that's building a decentralized platform for gambling games. The DAO.Casino ecosystem seeks to reward users for participating in the platform (whether they're developers or players), and ethereum distributes funds depending on the value they bring to the ecosystem.  The developers claim the platform will help protect users from gambling scams by ensuring that those running are operating accordingly.  Yet, even while the platform has laudable intentions, DAO.Casino must be licensed, and that means it must seek approval from regulators.  This raises questions around online gambling regulation, and it seems regulators are only in the early stages of thinking about blockchains and how they might mitigate scams.  A spokesperson for the European Commission told CoinDesk that it does not have a position on using blockchain technology as a way to regulate online gambling.  Gambling legislation remains a matter for member countries in the EU, she said.  The UK Gambling Commission (UKGC), likewise, warns gamblers and operators about the use of digital currency, but has no specific comments on the blockchain.  Tim Miller, the UKGC's executive director, told CoinDesk:  ""We think that by far the best way for consumers in Britain to protect themselves from scams is to check they're gambling with an operator licensed by us.""  In this context, an interesting disagreement seems to emerge. Namely, who should users trust, cryptography or authority?  New authority  Still, it remains unclear how much of a problem gambling scams are.  Stats from the UK, for example, show that 29% of the gambling market share is now online. Yet, concrete figures on the amount of people affected by online gambling scams and fraud are hard to come by.  The founders of DAO.Casino describe the traditional gambling infrastructure as being far too closed off and opaque.  For example, this month, bookmakers in the UK and Ireland are seeing a boost in online bets placed thanks to the Cheltenham races, but there have been allegations around the use of software to restrict gamblers and curtail their winnings.  In DAO.Casino's blockchain alternative, developers need to create games on smart contracts on the platform, yet after that, there is a more democratic review.  ""After that, somebody from the community or from the foundation makes an audit of your logic of your game,"" explained Ilya Tarutov, CEO of DAO.Casino.  He believes this creates greater trust among the community and encourages more users to play and gamble.  Waiting game  Faced with this prospect, regulators seem to suggest that there's little evidence that gambling scams are a pervasive problem.  The European Commission stressed that it makes recommendations on common principles for protecting consumers online, and that an expert group regularly discusses new technologies. Blockchain, it said, may be a future issue.  The spokesperson did however raise questions around how DAO.Casino presents itself.  ""We are certainly aware that there are many rogue websites out there and we know that regulators are facing huge challenges ... but the suggestion that all of ‘traditional’ gambling is unfair is not one we have come across before,"" she said.  She added:  ""Conversely, I am sure the proposed platform will raise regulatory questions for the relevant national authorities.""  For now, though, DAO.Casino is moving ahead, with about 1,000 test users.  Tarutov is seeking approval from the government of Curaçao to operate the games. The Caribbean island has granted licenses to bitcoin gambling site MegaDice for example.  Because of this, he stressed that the platform only in ""testing mode"" so far:  ""When we have a license we will start promoting it.""  For now, it seems, this means larger questions implied by blockchain may go unanswered.
