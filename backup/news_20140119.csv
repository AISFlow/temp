42376845,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6ecz3,1390143990,Bitcoin ATM Installations Surge in Canada,"Three cities in Canada are set to have bitcoin ATMs installed in the coming weeks, making the country the top ATM location in the world. New ATMs will be installed in the Canadian capital city Ottawa as well as Montreal and financial hub Toronto.  The ATM operators are announcing their plans to install machines across the country even as Canada's central bank issued a statement yesterday declaring bitcoin is not recognised as legal tender there.  Fadi Azouz, who operates the Montreal machine, said his ATM would be installed by 24th January at the Bitcoin Embassy in Montreal. It will take live rates from either BitStamp or the Canadian exchange Virtex and will charge a 5% fee for transactions. The 'embassy' is a non-profit organisation dedicated to promoting bitcoin. Azouz said the central bank's announcement would have no impact on his plans:  ""The [statement] does not affect us at all. As long as the millions of people using bitcoin around the world continue to believe in it and trust it to be an honest method of payment, it shall continue to [be] just that.""  Azouz added that his company, Vx5 Technologies, will be installing and operating bitcoin ATMs in eight countries this year. They include Lebanon, the Philippines, Hungary and Venezuela, among others.  Azouz will not be operating a Lamassu or Robocoin machine, which are the two most well known manufacturers of bitcoin ATMs at present. Instead, he has opted for a machine built by an Ottawa company called Bitaccess. The firm calls its machines 'BTMs'.  Bitaccess makes a machine that converts fiat currency to bitcoin and another model that does two-way conversions. Current players Lamassu and Robocoin offer machines that convert fiat to bitcoin or two-way conversions respectively.  The Ottawa ATM maker has also included a wallet-generation feature on its machines. This means the ATM can create a wallet for a user who does not have an existing way of storing bitcoins. According to Bitaccess, a high-entropy, one-time, paper wallet is generated, which is then scanned manually by the user. The company says it doesn't store any information about the printed wallets.  Ottawa will also get a Bitaccess machine, according to a report from the Ottawa Citizen. The machine will be operated by a company called BIT-Capital, which also claims to run several cryptocurrency investment funds. The Ottawa ATM was installed in the Clocktower Brew Pub yesterday, according to the Citizen's report. The micro-brewery boasts four home-brewed beers and an ""upscale pub menu"".    We are proud to host Canada's 1st @Bitcoin ATM installed in our #market spot by @BiTCapital #innovation #cryptoparty pic.twitter.com/XCuQ9TbIzn      — Clocktower Brew Pub (@The_Clocktower) January 16, 2014    Tom Drummond, a bitcoin user in Ottawa, said he welcomed the arrival of an ATM in the city. He said his current method of buying bitcoin on Canadian exchange Virtex takes between two hours and three days, depending on how he transfers his money to the exchange.  Virtex charges a 1.5% fee for a 120-day trading volume of less than 400 BTC and 0.5% for a trading volume greater than 2,000 BTC. It also allows customers to deposit or withdraw cash using a prepaid debit card that costs CA$10 for the card and CA$2 for each cash withdrawal from an ATM. The process can be complicated and daunting for a new user, which is one reason Drummond welcomes bitcoin ATMs in Canada.  ""I feel ATMs will be good exposure to the public for BTC,"" Drummond said.  In Toronto, Canada's commercial capital, an ATM has been installed at Bitcoin Decentral, a co-working space dedicated to bitcoin businesses in the city's downtown. The space is 5,500 sq ft spread over four floors. The ATM is run by the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada, according to a report from the Toronto Star. It's unclear what type of machine has been installed, but it appears that it is not a Lamassu, as the Star reports that it can perform two-way conversions between bitcoin and fiat currency.  Vancouver was the world's first city to have a bitcoin ATM permanently installed last October. That Robocoin unit made waves after it reportedly accepted more than CA$1m in deposits in its first 29 days of operation. Its operator, Bitcoiniacs, said in December that it would install Robocoin machines in Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto and Calgary in December, but the Bitcoiniacs website only lists the Vancouver machine.  Manufacturers of bitcoin ATMs, Lamassu and Robocoin, have been engaged in a race to sell their machines around the world. Lamassu announced it had sold its 100th unit. New players have been entering the scene, ranging from the open-source Skyhook ATM to Canada's homegrown Bitaccess BTM.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/01/19/bitcoin-atm-installations-surge-in-canada,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8df9f6f5ab55cc871a59cb24a05a9bd0d953015e-1000x789.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376828,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eclD,1390136273,Ripple Creator Donates $500k in XRP to Artificial Intelligence Research Charity,"The creator of Ripple and original founder of Mt. Gox, Jed McCaleb, recently made a donation worth roughly $500,000 in XRP to artificial intelligence researchers the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI).  Going on the XRP-USD exchange rate at the time of the donation, McCaleb's became the largest single contribution in the Institute's history. Though values have fluctuated and MIRI will not convert the donation into half a million US dollars straight away, it is still a startling amount and could be worth even more if the XRP value rises in future.  At the time of writing 1 XRP, the currency of the Ripple Network, was worth around $0.02.  MIRI  The Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI) is a tax-exempt, non-profit organization focusing on safety issues related to the development of 'Strong AI', or smarter-than-human artificial intelligence. Known as the Singularity Institute until January 2013, MIRI has a mission to ensure the creation of such intelligence has a positive impact on humanity.  Among its advisory board are names often associated with future studies, Transhumanism and the technological Singularity: Nick Bostrom, Aubrey de Grey, PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel and Foresight Nanotech Institute co-founder Christine Peterson. Ray Kurzweil was also a director from 2007-10. MIRI's executive director Luke Muehlhauser said:    ""In late 2013 I decided MIRI should begin accepting XRP donations in addition to BTC donations.      So I contacted Jed for advice, and he said 'Actually, I was thinking of making an XRP donation to you guys...' I didn't know at the time he was a fan of MIRI's research, but it turns out that he is.""    A donation in XRP leaves MIRI with a large amount of money it cannot easily spend, so the Institute has a strategy, Muehlhauser said: ""We are converting some of the XRP to US dollars and to BTC through the Ripple network, we are keeping a significant chunk in XRP as an investment, and we are also selling some XRP to fans (so as to improve our current asset allocation and grow the Ripple network simultaneously),""  Researching 'Friendly AI'  Muehlhauser said MIRI would use the donation to help fund the hiring of mathematical researchers to work full-time on sub-problems in its 'Friendly AI' theory.  The term 'Friendly AI' comes from research fellow Eliezer Yudkowsky. It is a sub-field 'machine ethics' or 'artificial morality', which focuses on constraining the behavior of 'narrow AI' systems. Research into Friendly AI aims to ensure any future, self-improving and general artificial intelligence is 'friendly' to humanity.  Machine ethics itself is not necessarily a far-flung or even Singularitarian idea: the US Department of Defense is already working on autonomous battlefield robots and airborne drones, and Congress has declared that a third of the US military's ground forces must be robotic by 2025.  There are a few problems more future-oriented Friendly AI research must bear in mind. For example, future machine 'superintelligences' will be far more powerful than the humans who caused them to exist, and thus they and humans may no longer be able to comprehend each other.  Such a superintelligence would also act precisely and literally based on the mechanisms put there by its designers, and would not understand the complexity or subtlety of its human designers' values (eg: the meaning of 'happiness').  Ripple, XRP and Ripple Labs  Ripple itself, still ""in beta"", is intended to be a distributed payment and currency exchange networkhttps://ripple.com/guide-to-currency-trading-on-the-ripple-network/, and XRP is its native currency unit through which trades are made. While users can use Ripple/XRP to trade any currency (digital or fiat) they choose, it's necessary to hold some XRP to participate.  Ripple has also been known to polarize the bitcoin community, with some seeing it as an evolution and others viewing its central ownership as a form of control that could threaten more distributed protocols. At November's US Senate Committee hearing, Ripple was the only digital payment network other than bitcoin to have representatives scheduled to testify on its behalf, however, they were absent on the day.  All XRP units already exist and do not require mining. The for-profit company that oversees it, Ripple Labs, does not sell any product but aims to distribute 55% of the currency and keep the rest, in the hope its value increases as the network gains popularity.  It either is or isn't a bitcoin competitor, depending on your perspective.  Jed McCaleb  Jed McCaleb  left his main role at Ripple Labs in July last year, but is still a director there. He is known to have an interest in AI research and development, and the technological Singularity.  He founded the current Mt. Gox in 2009, converting an old exchange for Magic: The Gathering Online trading cards into the world's first bitcoin-USD exchange in Tokyo. He sold the site to its current owners, Tibanne Ltd., in 2011. McCaleb was also the creator of the eDonkey2000 P2P filesharing network.  Thanks to this history he is sometimes mentioned as possibly one of the real identities behind bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto.
