42430806,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxvBh,1564607719,Ethereum: What the Next 4 Years Look Like,"Yesterday, ethereum celebrated its fourth birthday.  Four years ago, on July 30, 2015, the world’s first general-purpose blockchain platform went live. Called ethereum, the platform was the first of its kind to feature a Turing-complete virtual machine and native programming language able to deploy code of any algorithmic complexity.  “Before ethereum, developers had to design and write extremely complex software,” blockchain researcher Mihailo Bjelic told CoinDesk. “Ethereum introduced a generic programmable layer which abstracted this whole process and enabled developers to build decentralized applications by only writing their applications' core logic.”  There are roughly 800 monthly active developers building on the ethereum blockchain, according to new data from investment firm Electric Capital.  “This means that the ethereum ecosystem is experimenting an order of magnitude more than almost every other ecosystem,” said Electric Capital founder Avichal Garg.  That said, ethereum is no longer the only general-purpose blockchain in the world, nor even the most active by some metrics. The most recent quarterly report from Dapp.com shows that while ethereum is still the first choice for developers, other decentralized application (dapp) platforms such as Tron and EOS surpass ethereum in the number of active dapp users.  That leaves many industry observers wondering where ethereum will be in another four years. Will it retain its lead as a general-purpose blockchain platform in the face of a fast-rising competition?  Eric Conner, founder of information site ETHHub and product researcher at blockchain startup Gnosis, said:  “I think in four years, Ethereum will be moving past the hardest parts of its ambitious goals around proof-of-stake and scaling. At that point, the network will be able to onboard more users and we’ll start to grow beyond the use cases we are seeing today.”  Both proof-of-stake (a comparatively more eco-friendly version of the current consensus algorithm on ethereum) and scaling are bundled into an ambitious upgrade called ethereum 2.0 that many, not just Conner, envision to be completed in the next four years of ethereum’s existence.  Said Anthony Sassano, marketing and growth lead at ethereum-based startup Set Protocol:  “I believe that ethereum will achieve the original 'world computer' vision within the next four years because Ethereum 2.0 will have completed its roll-out. We will have mature scaling solutions (at all layers) and we will have proper privacy solutions.”  Ethereum’s future as money  At the same time, it’s not just core bottlenecks in the technology limiting transaction throughput and efficiency that experts say will need to be resolved about ethereum in coming years. Others both within and outside of the ethereum community say in the next four years, ethereum will also have to overcome challenges associated with its monetary identity.  Yaz Khoury, director of developer relations for the Ethereum Classic Cooperative (which helps build the protocol for ethereum’s sister chain, ETC), said:  “[Ethereum] is still struggling with a monetary identity. It’s not so much a cryptocurrency as much as a dapp market and network.”  To this, Ryan Sean Adams, founder of another crypto investment firm called Mythos Capital, sees ethereum establishing itself as a digital currency in four years time.  “Four years from now, it’ll be obvious that ETH isn’t a utility coin, it's money. A programmable store-of-value money,” he said. “Lending, borrowing, trading, saving. Each of these will be public protocols in the ethereum economy.”  As such, MakerDAO’s Conti thinks ethereum 2.0 and scalability challenges aren’t all that important to the immediate future of the protocol.  The continued growth of decentralized finance applications, on the other hand, is.  Mariano Conti, the MakerDAO Foundation’s head of smart contracts, said via email:  “I honestly believe that even if Ethereum 2.0 is significantly delayed, what we have right now is good enough for proper Decentralized Finance in the next three or four years. I expect more companies paying their employees streaming salaries in DAI. … I also expect (dread) the first big DeFi hack to happen soon, and this'll be something to watch out for.”  What ethereum investors are saying  On the flip side, major investors in ethereum say they aren’t worried about how the platform will transform in the next few years. On the contrary, progress in the last four years of ethereum’s existence has only proven to cement the technology’s lead.  “Ethereum has progressed significantly in making it easier for developers to build,” said Scalar Capital founder Linda Xie. “There's improved language, tooling and infrastructure. It's still a work in progress but it's much easier to build an application now than in the early days.”  Mythos Capital’s Adams estimates that close to $15 billion worth of tokenized assets have been generated on ethereum thus far. These assets will continue to snowball in popularity and generate even greater value for the ethereum platform in future years, says Adams.  “We’re also seeing a first generation of [decentralized finance] protocols [on ethereum], with $500 million locked in lending and exchange protocols over the last 18 months,"" Adamas said via email. ""These protocols will form the banking layer of this new open finance system.”  2019 alone has been and will continue to be an inspiring year for ethereum, said Paul Veradittakit, a partner at Pantera Capital, the oldest U.S. bitcoin investment firm which has invested in over 20 different ethereum-based startups to date.  “The Ethereum community has stayed focused during bull runs and kept faith during the crypto winter,” Veradittakit said, adding:  “That focus on building is really paying off, and the ecosystem is healthier and richer because of it. So many great Ethereum projects are set to launch this year, and it’s been incredibly inspiring to watch.”  Vitalik Buterin image via CoinDesk archives",NEUTRAL,ETC,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETC | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/07/31/ethereum-what-the-next-4-years-look-like,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8567a70bf134329b778f9f2e74f4c1b2bd018f2a-1500x985.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42430787,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxudh,1564605015,Marijuana-Focused Stablecoin Issuer Added to Arizona Fintech Sandbox,"A stablecoin project for the marijuana industry has joined an Arizona fintech sandbox.  According to Arizona’s Attorney Generals Office, startup Alta was accepted into the office's fintech program. The seventh startup to join to date, Alta is looking to address the banking needs of a $350 million statewide industry.  Current federal regulations prohibit bank involvement with the marijuana industry, leaving businesses searching for alternatives. State regulators believe Alta’s dollar-pegged-stablecoin and payment network provide such an alternative in addition to a healthy candidate for fintech development.  In a statement, co-founder and CEO of Alta Jesse Forrest pointed out the specificity of the product due to legal considerations:  ""We help solve the banking challenges facing medical marijuana companies and their vendors. ALTA uses blockchain and geofencing technology to protect clients’ digital payments and transfers. Other digital payment companies require a bank account. We provide all the financial services medical marijuana companies need without requiring a bank account.""  Alta’s stablecoin can be purchased via its platform. By purchasing ALTA coins, marijuana tainted transactions become legal sales providing an off-ramp for profits. The startup offers cash pickups in armoured vehicles with instant transfers into dollars available.  State Representative Jeff Weninger and creator of the fintech program welcomed Alta to the program, noting the “huge potential for stablecoin technology in cash-intensive businesses.”  The state backing of Alta adds to a mixed bag for the Grand Canyon state, as legislators failed to pass a cryptocurrency tax bill last May. The original bill sought to make state taxes payable in cryptocurrencies similar to Ohio. The bill failed to be passed before the session ended, however.

42430797,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxurh,1564603223,Judge Rules for Roger Ver in Craig Wright Libel Lawsuit,"A judge has struck down a libel lawsuit against Roger Ver, an early bitcoin investor, that was filed by Satoshi Nakamoto claimant Craig Wright.  Wright  alleged that Ver defamed him in a YouTube that was published in mid-April, in which Ver denounced Wright’s claim to be bitcoin’s anonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. The video was also circulated on Twitter.  According to court documents published Wednesday, Judge Sir Matthew Nicklin said Wright has not supplied sufficient justification that the trial should be overseen by the High Court of England and Wales. Citing both Wright’s international reputation and bitcoin’s global community, the court found that there was “no objective evidence” Wright’s reputation in England was harmed.  “The evidence clearly demonstrates that the most substantial publication of the statements complained of is in the US,” the court determined. Accordingly, only 7 percent of the video’s audience was based in the United Kingdom, per the documents.  Furthermore, the court found “there is no evidence at all of any actual reputational harm that the Claimant has suffered as a result of any of the defendant's publications.”  Since claiming authorship of the bitcoin white paper and its initial launch and development, Wright has denounced the cryptocurrency and its current set of developers. Additionally, following a controversial fork of the bitcoin blockchain that create bitcoin cash in 2018 -- an action endorsed by Ver -- Wright announced his own forked currency, bitcoin SV, which stands for Satoshi Vision.  Wright's suit against Ver isn't the only litigation he has pursued against critics. Wright has also lodged a libel suit against podcaster Peter McCormick, and previously threatened to sue ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and computer security entrepreneur John McAfee.

42430796,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxuxh,1564594209,"QuadrigaCX Judge Approves $1.6 Million in Expenses for EY, Law Firms","A Canadian judge approved more than $1.6 million in fees for firms that are seeking to recover funds from the now-defunct Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX.  Nova Scotia Supreme Court Judge Darlene Jamieson ruled Wednesday that all activities undertaken and fees incurred by Ernst & Young (EY), Stikeman Elliot (EY's legal counsel), Kirkland & Ellis (EY's American legal counsel), Miller Thomson (representative counsel) and Cox & Palmer (representative counsel) under the ongoing Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) proceeding on behalf of Quadriga would be approved.  ""There being no expressed opposition to the activities and accounts as presented by the monitor nor to the fees of its legal counsel, I approve the fees and activities of the monitor during the CCAA proceedings and the fees presented towards legal counsel,"" Jamieson said.  EY had a complicated task in trying to recover Quadriga's missing cryptocurrencies and fiat holdings from third parties, as well as in trying to determine whether Quadriga indeed held the funds it claimed to have, the judge said.  ""The monitor's work has been extensive in administering the CCAA proceeding and seeking to recover funds on behalf of Quadriga and its affected users,"" Jamieson said, adding:  ""The monitor has faced complicating factors, including a lack of books and records, and the use of third parties to store information. This is the first insolvency case in Canada involving cryptocurrency and has presented a number of unique issues, including requiring specialized resources for the monitor's investigation.""  EY and its legal counsel charged $1.3 million, ($1.7 million CAD), while the law firms acting as representative counsel charged $340,000 ($446,000 CAD), broken down as such:  EY: $592,396.57 ($778,444.90 CAD)  Stikeman: $684,654.63 ($899,677.57 CAD)  Kirkland & Ellis: $14,367.27 ($18,876.44 CAD)  Miller Thomson: $302,720.47 ($397,793.00 CAD)  Cox & Palmer: $37,023.05 ($48,650.53 CAD)  All told, the judge approved $1,631,161.99 ($2,143,442.44 CAD) in costs to each of the companies.  The payments will come from the recovered funds in the creditor accounts, which total roughly $25 million ($33 million CAD), according to a previous report by EY.  This leaves roughly $23.4 million (or $31 million CAD) to be distributed among the creditors. EY is trying to secure another $9 million ($12 million CAD) by selling off certain assets from the estate of Gerald Cotten, Quadriga's deceased founder and CEO.  Claims process  Miller Thomson recently also kicked off the claims process for Quadriga creditors, with information posted to its website. The exchange's former users have to fill out a form, with a final due date of August 31.  Users will need to provide their Quadriga account number, full name, telephone number and address, as well as the amount of each cryptocurrency and fiat they held in the exchange prior to its closure. EY has set up a website for individuals unsure of the amounts they held, or who need to verify.  Any users who disagree with the amounts shown on EY's website will have to provide documentation supporting what they believe is their actual claim amount. A full set of directions on how they can do so has been posted to Miller Thomson's website.  QuadrigaCX first made headlines worldwide in January when court documents revealed Cotten had died, taking the passwords to the exchange's crypto wallets with him. At the time, his widow, Jennifer Robertson, filed an affidavit claiming that Quadriga owed roughly 115,000 users a combined $190 million, and that she could not access any of its funds as Cotten was the only operator with knowledge of the private keys for its crypto accounts.  Subsequent investigations by EY found that Cotten may have actually appropriated his customers' holdings for personal use, including to support the margin trading of cryptocurrencies such as zcash, dogecoin, dash and omisego.  EY reported in March that it could not locate or account for more than $100 million in various cryptocurrencies that the exchange was supposed to have held.  While the exchange entered the CCAA process in January, EY moved to have it placed in bankruptcy, indicating that Quadriga will not recover from the losses. Nova Scotia Supreme Court Judge Michael Wood approved the motion, with bankruptcy operations running parallel to the CCAA proceeding.  With Wednesday's ruling, the CCAA process will wrap up, and the exchange will officially only be in bankruptcy.

Ripple committed $50 million toward the project to develop blockchain, cryptocurrency, and digital network programs. Funds sent to the Japanese universities will fuel undergraduate, graduate, and PhD studies. The University of Tokyo will also issue scholarships with the funds.  “University partners will continue to increase positive awareness of the transformative impact that blockchain technology will have across various industries,” SVP of Global Operations at Ripple Eric van Miltenburg said. “As the industry matures, the academic community plays a pivotal role in paving the road for innovative companies and entrepreneurs leveraging blockchain technologies and digital assets.”  Academia continues to play a role in Ripple’s roadmap.

42430803,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxv1h,1564590306,Litecoin Is 'Halving' Soon: What's Happening and What You Should Know,"A rule embedded within litecoin’s (LTC) code is set to soon reduce rewards for the miners who today ensure transaction processing on the world's fourth-largest blockchain by total value.  In approximately five days, litecoin will undergo a scheduled reward halving – a process aimed at preserving cryptocurrency’s purchasing power. The mining reward is currently set at 25 litecoins ($2,500) per block and will drop to 12.5 litecoins ($1,200) per block on Aug. 5.  With that transition, the protocol will be adding significantly fewer litecoins to the market after Aug. 5.  The halving, therefore, sounds similar to interest rate hikes and other measures initiated by central banks across the globe when combating high inflation, so investors may feel tempted to snap up litecoins while heading into the event.  However, while the cryptocurrency may pick up a bid in the next couple of days, big gains look unlikely with the price action of the last six months suggesting that an impending supply cut has already been priced in by savvy traders.  LTC doubled in value in the first quarter  Litecoin, which traded at $30 on Jan. 1, ended the first quarter at $61, representing a 100 percent gain. That was LTC’s best first-quarter performance on record, as reported by CoinDesk on March 31.  More importantly, the cryptocurrency eked out stellar gains in the first three months of this year despite the flat action in bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency.  Essentially, LTC broke into a bull market well before bitcoin confirmed a bearish-to-bullish trend change with a big move above key resistance at $4,236 on April 2. Prices went on to hit highs above $140 in June before falling back to $80 earlier this month.  Litecoin’s non-price metrics have also risen sharply since mid-December, hitting new record highs several times over the last couple of months. For instance, hashrate or computing power dedicated to mining rose to 523.81 TH/s on July 14, up 258 percent from the low of 146.21 TH/s seen in December 2018, according to bitinfocharts.com.  History repeating itself  Litecoin leading the broader market higher with 100 percent gains in the first quarter followed by a rise to highs above $145 in June. Yet, the recent drop to $80 is reminiscent of the price action seen in months ahead of the previous reward halving, which took place on Aug. 25, 2015.  Back then, prices bottomed out at $1.12 in January and peaked at $8.72 in July before falling back to $2.55 by Aug. 25.  More importantly, following the reward halving, prices remained trapped largely in a narrow range of $2.5 to $5.5 before picking a strong bid in April 2017.  If history is a guide, then LTC may trade in a sideways manner post next week’s reward halving, unless BTC makes a move toward the record high of $20,000.  Miner participation may drop after halving  The mining profitability will likely drop by 50 percent along with block rewards, as mining difficulty – a measure of how hard it is to maintain and add to the blockchain – seldom adjusts immediately. So, some miners may shift to other blockchains, leading to a drop in the hashrate.  The computing power, however, may tick higher over the coming months, as the drop in the inflation rate to 4 percent from the current 8.4 percent per year will likely bode well for LTC’s price. That would compensate for the slide in the mining profitability.  It is worth noting that the hashrate had dropped by 15 percent around the previous halving before rebounding in the next two weeks, according to Binance Research.

According to the companies, fans of the game can buy, sell, and trade digitally collectable in-season moves like “Kevin Durant’s 3-point shot or Joel Embiid’s dunk.” Digital collectables can be used for on-chain games or tournaments.  Similar to current products like NBA 2K, Dapper’s NBA Top Shot allows users to acquire players and build rosters with an additional hook: purchasing specific moves from the prior season.  Dapper Labs next product comes two years after the launch of CryptoKitties, the number one blockchain-based game, and months after a pre-sale and of its second major game, Cheese Wizardz.  The National Basketball Association is joined by the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA), a player’s union founded in 1954. Speaking on the matter, NBPA commerical executive Josh Goodstadt touts Dapper’s product as “an entirely new way for fans to connect with their favorite athletes.”  Goodstadt said:  “We believe blockchain technology creates a truly unique product that fans can collect, manage and engage within a fun environment.”  NBA Top Shot Collectibles is set to launch this fall in time for the NBA's regular-season tip-off, with the full game going live in early 2020. Per an email, Dapper Labs says they are “working directly with the [NBPA] to make sure players benefit from the experience.""  Dapper’s product is not the first introduction between blockchain and major league sports: the Cleveland Cavaliers recently signed UnitedCoin as its official cryptocurrency with the Miami Dolphins signing with the Litecoin Foundation last month.  UPDATE (July 31, 13:45 UTC): This article has been updated to show that Cheese Wizardz has not yet fully launched.

42430794,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxuph,1564578001,CFTC: LedgerX 'Not Approved' to Launch 'Physical' Bitcoin Futures,"UPDATE 13:40 UTC: In a statement received by CoinDesk Thursday, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) says LedgerX has ""not yet been approved by the Commission"" to offer physically settled bitcoin futures, contradicting the company's claims.  Since the CFTC's statement, LedgerX officials have acknowledged that the previously announced futures did not launch. More details can be found here.      The Takeaway  Bitcoin derivatives provider LedgerX announced it has launched the first physically-settled bitcoin futures contracts in the U.S. Wednesday.  The contracts, which pay traders out in bitcoin, rather than U.S. dollars, will be available to both institutional and retail investors.  Customers can deposit bitcoin, rather than dollars, when buying a contract.  LedgerX has beaten the Intercontinental Exchange’s Bakkt and TD Ameritrade-backed ErisX to the punch with its new offering.      Any U.S. resident with a government-issued I.D. can now trade futures contracts for real bitcoin.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, LedgerX has officially launched the first physically-settled bitcoin futures contracts in the U.S., beating the Intercontinental Exchange’s Bakkt and TD Ameritrade-backed ErisX to the punch.  Perhaps more importantly, LedgerX is offering the new product to both institutional and retail investors, allowing anyone who can pass know-your-customer (KYC) processes to trade the contracts, not just institutional clients with millions in assets.  LedgerX CEO Paul Chou told CoinDesk that retail customers can trade the product using his company’s new Omni platform, which recently went live, while institutional clients can trade futures as with any of LedgerX’s other products.  While LedgerX is not the first bitcoin futures provider in the U.S., it is the first to offer physical futures, meaning customers receive the actual bitcoin they bet on when the contracts expire, rather than the cash equivalent.  Moreover, customers don’t need to put U.S. dollars in to bet on the product. Chou explained that traders can buy contracts using bitcoin.  “Not only are they delivered physically in the sense that our customers can get bitcoin after the futures expires, but also they can deposit bitcoin to trade in the first place,” he said. “Cash-settled is cash-in and cash-out, we’re bitcoin-in and bitcoin-out.”  He believes this is the first time that a regulated company is able to allow customers to deposit bitcoin as collateral for a contract.  Because of this, customers do not need to wait for bank transfers or on other limitations of the U.S. banking system to participate, he said.  “If you imagine somebody that deposits bitcoin, they would not have to use the U.S. banking system at all. That’s why physically-settled is very important,” he said. “I think [it’s] one of the most unique use cases for bitcoin, where you’re using cryptocurrencies as the only collateral.”  This is possible using the physically-settled contract, he said, adding:  “As a digital commodity, bitcoin trades 24/7/365 and our customers expect that from us, so if you trade Sunday night, the banking system did not have to be open.”  Opening retail  LedgerX  revealed that it was looking to offer bitcoin futures in April, having filed with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for the requisite licenses in November 2018.  The CFTC granted LedgerX a designated contract markets (DCM) license last month, giving the platform the final approval it needed (the company previously had derivatives clearing organization and swaps execution facility approvals through the CFTC).  The company, though formed in 2014, only began offering physically-settled bitcoin derivatives products in 2017. However, its options and swaps products have initially been geared toward institutional customers.  Since then, the company has been working to ensure that anybody could trade its products, Chou said.  “We’ve been involved in this business for the last six years and we have not only been getting institutions on board but we’ve spent a lot of time educating regulators on why this is important,” he said, adding:  “Cryptocurrencies are for everybody and we never started this looking to offer just to hedge funds or institutional clients.”  John Todaro, director of research at TradeBlock, told CoinDesk that physically-settled contracts allow traders to more appropriately hedge their bets, which may be beneficial for non-speculative institutions.  “Additionally, cash-settled futures contracts could potentially be more susceptible to manipulation depending on the formula, and underlying spot exchanges or indices used for settlement at expiry,” he said.  Normally, cash-settled contracts are also cheaper than physically-settled ones, as traditional commodities have delivery costs associated with them. These delivery costs likely disappear with digital assets, however, Todaro added.  “Given cash contracts are more simple relative to physical contracts, physical contracts would likely be more useful for an institution than retail,” he said.  Competitive market  Bitcoin futures have drawn attention in the U.S. since at least 2017, when CME and Cboe announced they were launching cash-settled contracts. While Cboe ended support for its product earlier this year, CME continues to enjoy sizeable trading volume.  TD Ameritrade, the giant online stock brokerage, also offers its clients access to CME’s futures contracts.  However, LedgerX is not necessarily competing with cash contracts, Chou said. For one thing, the two types of contracts “are entirely different.”  “Really we have a lot of folks who never even touch U.S. dollars,” he said. “Cash-settled is very different from what we do.”  This applies to Omni as well, he said. The platform “is really going to be a new product for retail that is going to be unique in that it’s going to be incredibly simple.”  He added:  “It’s going to make available to the retail public all sorts of ability to trade bitcoin, whether it’s spot, futures, options and we have a lot of things in the pipeline.”  (Unlike futures, swaps are not based on the asset itself, but rather its performance, while options are a non-binding contract.)  LedgerX is in good company. A number of companies are planning on offering physically-settled bitcoin futures in the U.S.  Bakkt, which was set up by the New York Stock Exchange’s parent firm to much acclaim last year and TD Ameritrade-backed ErisX have both announced their intention to enter the market.  Bakkt has self-certified its contracts through the CFTC, and is now waiting on a trust charter from the New York Department of Financial Services to set up its warehouse. Once the trust charter is approved, Bakkt will likely be able to launch within a few weeks.  The firm conducted user acceptance testing on July 22, ensuring that customers, clearing members and the provider were all able to communicate when trialing the contracts.  ErisX, like LedgerX, has received the necessary CFTC approvals, though it has not announced a timeline for launching its futures contracts. The company began offering a cryptocurrency spot trading market in April 2019.

The exchange announced Tuesday that it has bought Interchange, an accounting, reconciliation and reporting service provider that it says offers an ""institutional-grade"" service.  Interchange  notably boasts as co-founders Dan Held, formerly director of product at wallet (and now crypto exchange) provider Blockchain and co­-founder of ZeroBlock, and Clark Moody, founder of Blockchain acquired bitcoin trading platform RTBTC.  Kraken's new acquisition aims to provide institutional investors better tools to monitor and report their crypto portfolios.  According to the press release, Interchange is already providing services for at least 60 institutions, including digital assets accounting and administration company MG Stover.  Kraken says the added service will compliment its multi-exchange charting, trading and portfolio-tracking platform Cryptowatch, allowing it to offer products including historical and current data, advanced charting, multi-exchange trade executions, research and insights, critical accounting and portfolio reconciliation tools, and crypto indices.  Kraken CEO Jesse Powell said:  “I couldn’t be more excited to welcome Dan, Clark and the Interchange team to Kraken. What’s great about Interchange is that it makes accounting, trade reconciliation and reporting so much easier for institutions and individuals trading on Kraken, so our clients can stay focused on tapping the tremendous value that cryptocurrency markets offer.”  The news marks the latest acquisition from Kraken, which has been on something of a spending spree this year.  Just this month, it snapped up Cryptofinance.ai, a software tool providing prices and market data from over 50 exchanges.  More notably, in February, Kraken brought crypto futures exchange Crypto Facilities (now Kraken Futures) into its fold via a deal worth at least $100 million.

42430804,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxv7h,1564570933,Bitcoin Price on Track to Post First Monthly Loss Since January,"View  Bitcoin looks set to end its five-month winning streak with prices currently down 9 percent from the monthly opening price of $10,759, according to Bitstamp data.  A low-volume price breakout seen on 4-hour chart indicates BTC may have a tough time scaling key resistance at $10,235 in the next few hours.  Long-term charts retain the bullish bias despite the monthly loss.  A UTC close above $11,120 is needed to revive the short-term bullish outlook.      Bitcoin (BTC) appears on track to end July on a negative note, having logged gains in the preceding five months.  The top cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading at $9,740 on Bitstamp, representing a 9.3 percent drop on the opening price of $10,759 seen on July 1, according to Bitstamp data.  If prices print a UTC close below $10,759 today, then it would be the first monthly loss since January.  The cryptocurrency rallied 11, 8, 28, 62 and 25.89 percent, respectively, in the previous five months. That was the longest monthly winning streak since August 2017, as seen in the chart below.  BTC’s five-month winning streak was preceded by a record six-month losing run.  The 9.3 percent drop seen at press time is the biggest monthly loss since November 2018.  While BTC looks set to end the month in the red, it has rallied by $1,000 in just a few minutes in recent past. For instance, the cryptocurrency jumped from $9,300 to $10,400 in 30 minutes during the U.S. trading hours on July 18.  Further, prices rose from $4,100 to $5,080 in two hours to 06:00 UTC on April 2 this year, confirming a long-term bullish breakout.  So, with the UTC close still 14 hours away, a sudden $1,000 move to levels above the monthly opening price of $10,759 cannot be ruled out.  As of now, however, the technical charts indicate a low probability of a UTC close above $10,759.  4-hour chart  BTC’s 4-hour chart shows a descending triangle breakout, a sign the pullback from highs above $13,000 has ended.  The breakout is also backed by the relative strength index (RSI), which is reporting bullish conditions with an above-50 print.  Even so, BTC may not be able to push beyond the bearish lower high of $10,235 on the 4-hour chart, as trading volumes haven’t picked up with the price breakout. A low-volume breakout is often short-lived.  While a negative monthly close looks likely, the long-term outlook will remain bullish as long as prices are held above the 200-day moving average (MA), currently at $6,417.  Also, despite the monthly loss, the bullish structure on the long-term chart remains intact, as seen in the chart below.  Monthly chart  Both the falling channel breakout confirmed in April and the ascending 5- and 10-month MAs indicate the path of least resistance is to the higher side.  The RSI is holding well above 50, indicating an intact bull market.  It is worth noting that a similar bearish channel breakout in the final quarter of 2015 paved way for a record rally to $20,000.

42430801,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxv5h,1564567232,UK Finance Watchdog Issues Guidance on Regulation for Bitcoin and Crypto Assets,"The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has finalized its guidance on crypto assets, clarifying which tokens fall under its jurisdiction.  Most of the rules issued Wednesday were proposed in consultation paper CP19, which was released for public comment in January. As widely expected, the final guidance does not drastically alter the regulatory landscape, instead specifying when certain types of crypto assets fall under existing categories.  True cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether, which the FCA classes “exchange tokens,” are not regulated, though anti-money-laundering rules apply.  The FCA said some 92 responses to the consultation paper were received from an assortment of firms, including banks, trade associations and crypto exchanges. Most respondents supported the proposals, said the FCA  Importantly, the guidance provides a definition of security tokens. When issued, these assets behave like shares or debt instruments, including ownership rights, thus falling under the category of a “specified investment” and, in turn, the FCA’s remit. Almost all respondents who answered the question agreed with the regulator's assessment of security tokens in relation to the regulatory perimeter.  Utility tokens, by contrast, do not grant the same sorts of rights as regulated financial instruments and will generally fall outside the FCA’s remit, except in circumstances when they meet the definition of electronic money and fall within a new category of e-money tokens.  The agency said:  ""Any token that is not a security token, or an e-money token is unregulated. However, market participants should note certain activities that use tokens may nevertheless be regulated, for example, when used to facilitate regulated payments.""  Certain stablecoins may also meet the e-money definition, though, and hence would also be subject to oversight by FCA (whose mandate is consumer and investor protection).  The watchdog said, though, that ""Market participants should use the Guidance as the first step in understanding how they should treat certain cryptoassets, however definitive judgements can only be made on a case-by-case basis.""  Christopher Woolard, executive director of Strategy and Competition at the FCA, said in a statement:  ""This is a small, complex and evolving market covering a broad range of activities. Today’s guidance will help clarify which cryptoasset activities fall inside our regulatory perimeter.""  A firm can issue security tokens without needing a regulatory license, in the same way that issuing shares does not require a license. But in any scenarios in which the tokens are traded, the advisers and brokers handling the tokens, and the financial promotions regime, will need authorization, said the FCA.  If a security token is tradeable on the capital market, said the FCA, it will further be considered a transferable security under the European Union’s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), and that regime will apply too.  Blurred lines  The initial coin offering explosion of 2017-18 has largely abated, removing some of the pressure on regulators, but there are still wrinkles when it comes to the business of defining certain types of crypto assets.  Given the growing popularity of security token offerings, there could be a blurring of the lines between those and utility tokens, according to Jacqui Hatfield, a partner specializing in crypto at the London office of law firm Orrick.  Hatfield pointed to possible cases when a utility token could wind up being dressed in a security token wrapper, telling CoinDesk:  “The interesting thing is where you have got utility tokens that are dressed up as security tokens just to make sure that they don't fall foul of any promotion type restrictions. So the question is, does that actually change the nature of the token itself when it comes to trading it?”  In this regard, Nick Cook, director of innovation, FCA, reiterated the need to look at the nature of individual tokens and issuances on a case-case basis. ""We don't rely on the labeling, particularly with something like stablecoins, where we find the terminology is not especially helpful, because it could be a security token, it could be an e-money token, or it could be an unregulated token,"" Cook told CoinDesk, adding:  ""So an individual or entity may attempt to make a token appear, in one way or another, to fit within or without the parameters, but we always look at the underlying characteristics.""  As stated in the original consultation paper, utility tokens might meet the definition of e-money in certain circumstances (as could other tokens), in which case activities in relation to them may be within the FCA’s jurisdiction.  The FCA agreed further clarity between types of tokens was required and said it will separate e-money tokens from the utility tokens and security tokens categories. “This will create a specific regulated e-money token category and an unregulated category that includes utility tokens,” said the regulator.  Stablecoins, which are designed to maintain parity with fiat currency, may also fall within the definition of e-money, according to the paper. These may be considered electronic money where the crypto asset is issued on receipt of funds (i.e. fiat currency, not other crypto assets) and is accepted by a person other than the electronic money issuer.  This would include crypto assets that are issued on receipt of British pounds and are pegged to that currency, as long as the asset is accepted by a third party, noted Hatfield.  The FCA refers to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether which have no controlling authority or centralized issuer as exchange tokens and these are outside its parameters of regulation. However, exchange tokens will be caught (along with other crypto assets) by the EU’s 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD), which will be transposed into UK law by the end of 2019.    Bradley Rice, senior regulatory associate at law firm Ashurst, said the more interesting paper will be from the Treasury because this could amend the regulatory perimeter – something the FCA was at pains to state in its response, adding:      ""The FCA's hands are tied. If the UK wants to bring more crypto assets into the regulatory net, the law has to be changed and that is in the Treasury's gift.""            Derivatives ban  Perhaps the most controversial move by the FCA – one separate from Wednesday’s guidance – is the proposed ban on crypto derivatives for retail investors, including options, futures, contracts for difference (CFDs) and exchange-traded notes with underlying (unregulated) cryptoassets like bitcoin, for example.  Starting in August, the FCA is making restrictions for non-crypto CFDs and then at the start of September for non crypto CFD-like options. The consultation for how to deal with derivatives with underlying crypto assets ends October 3; the FCA's proposal on this is a blanket ban.  Hatfield said the notion of a ban on crypto derivatives was the only thing set out in the FCA’s crypto regulations she staunchly disagrees with.  “The intention is that this will become a blanket ban for retail generally in the future,” she said, concluding:  “My view is these should be treated like derivatives on the retail market generally, like any other derivative because these are no riskier.”  Chief Executive Officer of the Financial Conduct Authority, Andrew Bailey, via SIFMA",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/07/31/uk-finance-watchdog-issues-guidance-on-regulation-for-bitcoin-and-crypto-assets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f5badf74ebf5752a0e357e184769c5a39b149c97-2354x1344.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The in-browser app Lolli already offers this feature for desktop users and is developing a mobile app of its own. Now with Fold entering the game, bitcoiners might benefit from competition between the shopping apps. But while Lolli offers an in-browser, custodial wallet, which can also be used to send bitcoin rewards to external wallets, Fold’s app automatically directs the rewards to an external wallet specified by the user.  “It's akin to accruing rewards points, just these are denominated in satoshis [fractions of bitcoin],” Fold product lead Will Reeves told CoinDesk. “They can be used for purchases within Fold or withdrawn to an actual bitcoin wallet.”  Fold’s lightning compatibility also sets it apart from Lolli’s beginner-friendly service. This is possible because while Lolli works directly with merchants, Fold partners with pre-paid card networks and essentially buys a gift card with users’ bitcoin then facilitates the purchase on users’ behalf.  Reeves said the lighting pizza feature has generated nearly $22,000 worth of transactions so far, with dozens of pizza purchases still rolling in every day.  Executives at both Lolli and Fold now say their respective startups have thousands of active monthly users. Lolli CEO Alex Adelman told CoinDesk that, in addition to launching a mobile app, his team has plans to implement lightning options into the Lolli payout feature.  “Lightning will be a powerful tool to help with the mainstream adoption of bitcoin,” Adelman told CoinDesk. “I’m excited to eventually share it with all our merchants.”  Meanwhile, from Reeves’ perspective, competitors like Lolli have adapted incumbent affiliate models while Fold seeks to build a new payments system.  “Soon, Fold users will be able to spend any currency they choose directly with these retailers and get free bitcoin for doing so,” Reeves said. “Beneath all the fun of shopping and rewards we intend to introduce a whole new paradigm to consumer spending.”  Image via Fold app",POSITIVE,없음,BTC,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/07/31/fold-app-adds-bitcoin-kickbacks-for-purchases-at-target-starbucks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/27380ef9c764f34796611bd36123e8abaf42e237-2324x996.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Revealed Wednesday, the release of B3i's v1.0 of its Property Catastrophe Excess of Loss Reinsurance product comes a year after the firm's announcement that it would use Corda to build its future products.  The new Cat XoL product is aimed to bring greater speed and lower cost to the market, allowing insurers, brokers and reinsurers to ""interact, negotiate and place risk more securely and efficiently.""  The firm said:  ""The B3i Cat XoL product is a ‘first of its kind’ proposition which provides a market wide, integrated network of B3i V1.0 nodes. Integrating brokers with insurers and reinsurers, this provides the participants with a dedicated infrastructure for risk transfer execution, where data is not only exchanged but also notarised and certified.""  The product removes the need for some of the manual and time-consuming tasks from the process of renewing an insurance treaty. It also ensures only relevant parties are given real-time access to the contract terms and conditions, offerings and signatures, removing the ""contract uncertainty"" that afflicts the current manual process, explained the firm.  Operational risk is also said to be reduced thanks to the elimination of manual errors such as double entries of data.  B3i said it has ""worked with the market"" to develop the product.  Sylvain De Crom, B3i's chief product officer, said:  “B3i is shipping its first application and this is our first opportunity to share with the wider market, not only the Cat XoL application, but also the wider infrastructure we have built to date. The importance of this release is fundamental in delivering to the insurance market the ability for seamless negotiation, efficient placement and contract certainty on a distributed platform that allows parties to retain ownership of their data.”  The firm's CEO, John Carolin – who was appointed in July – added: “This is a pivotal moment for B3i.""  In February, the startup quietly raised about $16 million, bringing its total funding to over $22 million, according to corporate registry filings in Switzerland.

Canaan would not provide comment when contacted by CoinDesk.  A report from Bloomberg in January, also suggested Canaan’s IPO could be launched this year in New York, although the process was then said to be in its early stages.  Canaan – maker of the popular Avalon miner range – had previously been seeking to go public in Hong Kong to apparently raise about $1 billion, filing publicly for an IPO in March of last year. That plan, though, has been abandoned and the firm’s Hong Kong Stock Exchange application lapsed in November.  In March, it was reported that the firm was considering an IPO attempt on the newly created Science and Technology (Sci-Tech) Innovation Board within the Shanghai Stock Exchange, in addition to its communication with the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ.  Confidential filings for companies of all sizes are allowed in the U.S., after the Securities and Exchange Commission in July 2017 changed the rules in a bid to encourage more IPOs. Prior to that, only smaller firms were allowed private applications.  Firm's IPO registration statements are submitted in an SEC filing, the S-1, around three to four months before their planned launch. The SEC reviews the documents before approving the public offering.  Rival miner manufacturer Bitmain also failed in its bid to IPO in Hing Kong and was reported to be considering an attempt in the U.S. in June.

The Far-East Trading and Industrial Company, or DTPK, may have failed to pay about $1.2 million on 6,012 Bitmain-manufactured ASIC miners imported from August 2017 to February 2018, according to a search warrant obtained by CoinDesk.  DTPK, based in Moscow, showed customs officers falsified documents with the incorrect prices for the equipment, which included Bitmain's Antminer S9-13.5, L3+ and D3 models, along with power elements for them, says the search warrant, dated July 17.  The company also reported to the customs service that it received the miners from a Korean firm, MSR Co., via a Hong Kong-based company called Manli. However, when contacted by customs officers, MSR said it didn't have a contract with DTPK, except an expired one signed back in 2012, the document says.  The warrant, translated from Russian, claims:  ""In an undefined time, but no later than August 8, 2017, [DTPK CEO] Artem Aleksandrovich Bublik ... got involved in a criminal conspiracy with undefined individuals, the goal of the conspiracy being avoiding due customs fees in especially large amounts while importing into the Eurasian Economic Union of ASIC miners and power elements for ASIC miners.""  When reached by CoinDesk, Bublik asked this reporter to call him back later.  He hasn't picked up the phone since. The customs service declined to comment because CoinDesk is not accredited with Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  An armed raid for ASICs  The investigation was made public during the TerraCrypto mining conference in Moscow on July 25.  Alexander Shashkov, the founder of Intelion Mining, said customs officers suspected the DTPK-imported miners ended up at his company's data center and sent armed personnel to his offices in two Russian cities as recently as July 18.  Shashkov told the audience:  ""In Tula, 20 people with machine guns arrived; in Moscow, 10 people without machine guns, just pistols. ... [They] told everyone to get their hands off the computers.""  According to him, Intelion had nothing to do with the miners under investigation, but law enforcement ended up seizing 2,500 ASICs hosted by the company anyway because the clients who owned them hadn't presented valid documentation.  He followed the story with advice for fellow mining entrepreneurs to always check the documents for the miners they take for hosting.  Grey miners  Most of the mining hardware coming to Russia from China may be lacking proper documentation, market participants say.  ""Seventy percent of miners from China are coming via grey schemes, but we're working only with the legit ones,"" Intelion's sales director, Alexey Afanasev, told CoinDesk.  Anton Makarchuk, chief marketing officer of Cryptouniverse, a company selling mining equipment in Russia, agreed with that estimate.  Bitmain's representative in Russia, Yulia Fetisova, told CoinDesk the grey imports might be coming into the country through companies that buy large batches of miners from the Beijing-based manufacturer and resell them to retail clients.  Fetisova said:  ""The grey ones come from the Chinese reselling companies and don't go through the Russian office. Often, people don't want to wait for the delivery from us, so they go to these reselling companies because they want their miners here and now.""  The waiting time for Bitmain's hardware increased this year, she said, with the next shipment of Bitmain's S17 ASICs available in December at the earliest.

42430779,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxrPh,1564538426,WATCH: Metal Pay CEO Says He Isn't a Bitcoin Maximalist,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drliJL6lZq0  Is bitcoin a currency or commodity? That is one of the questions Marshall Hayner, CEO of Metal Pay, reflected on during an interview with Leigh Cuen of CoinDesk. According to Hayner, whatever the use case, it’s likely the industry will see more regulation going forward.  In fact, it’s this increased oversight that may finally answer the ineffable question of what are cryptocurrencies.  “I think… we're going to see a clear definition of what securities are on a Blockchains by the SEC,” he said. He also thinks there will be “more rules around ICOs.”  While Hayner is both prepared for and welcomes regulation, he believes the new FATF travel rule and money transmitting restrictions may make it more difficult to operate wallet services and exchanges.  “If you're a 14-year-old developer in your bedroom making a dogecoin wallet you should not have to be a registered money service business, you should not have to be a registered money transmitter,” Hayner said. “Now I don't necessarily think that's going to happen, but it could go down that road if we don't inform regulators how we can start to make more compliant tools around the blockchain, instead of just taking best guesses at blockchain transaction monitoring and blustering of addresses.”  “We have to inform and innovate as a community on this, because it is going to become increasingly prohibitive,” Hayner said.  To this end, Hayner said he is building educational services on his platform.  “We have this concept of ‘discover’ [on Metal Pay] which is to show people information about cryptos,” he said, using a “little source where we're putting curated content.” Adding, “We're going to start to allow the coins and the companies in this space to also get their information out there as well as news outlets.”  This spirit of discovery and education that keeps Hayner's mind open to the possibilities of cryptocurrencies.  ""Just learn. Don't get stuck to any one thing, don't think I'm a maximalist of Bitcoin, don't go look I'm a maximalist of ethereum or any coin. Keep your mind open and you will succeed.""

42430776,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxrBh,1564533008,Overstock to Pay Shareholders a Dividend in tZERO-Listed 'Digital Securities',"Online retailer Overstock.com announced it will pay shareholder dividends in a digital security listed on its affiliate company tZero's trading platform.  The move, approved by the company’s board of directors, will see that one digital voting series A-1 preferred stock (series A-1) will represent 10 shares of common stock, or 10 shares of voting series B preferred stock, according to a statement released Tuesday.  Approximately 40,000 holders hold around 37 million shares of Overstock. Meaning that – at a 10:1 ratio of common stock to series A-1 shares – approximately 3.7 million digital shares will be disbursed. These include shares that are held as part of investor's 401(k) or IRAs.  The record date for the digital asset dividend is set for September 23, 2019, following the firm’s third quarter, and will be ""shipped"" to an investor's custodial wallet in mid-November.  The company discloses the digital shares have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, and can be traded only through a Dinosaur Financial Group brokerage account. Additionally, as previously reported, Electronic Transaction Clearing will act as a clearinghouse and custodian, and Computershare as transfer agent.  That being said, ""investors can receive their dividend to the same broker with which they hold their common shares,"" according to the investors website.  Overstock.com CEO Patrick M. Byrne said, “The bundle of legal rights represented by each of these new A-1 shares is similar to the bundle of legal rights embodied in shares of our common stock (OSTK) that trades on NASDAQ.”  The Series A-1 was initially unveiled in June, as the second tradable digital asset available to accredited investors on the PRO Securities alternative trading system (ATS), a platform backed by Overstock-subsidiary tZero. The security is listed as OSTKO on this SEC-registered the platform.  Bryne said he cannot predict whether these digital assets will trade “in rough approximation” with the firm’s traditional stock, and makes note of the possible arbitrage opportunities between the two types of shares.  That being said, Byrne sees this move a step towards a blockchain-based capital market, which stands opposed to the traditional “trading and settlement mechanisms about which [he has] long made [his] criticisms and doubts known.”  Byrne said:  “Five years ago, we set out to create a parallel universe: a legal, blockchain-based capital market. We’ve succeeded.”  Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne via CoinDesk archives",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/07/31/overstock-to-pay-shareholders-a-dividend-in-tzero-listed-digital-securities,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/21fdd879112e403f89bd5d3951cdc871fe269388-1500x998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
