42427493,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVilh,1493078154,ICO Insanity? $300 Million Gnosis Valuation Sparks Market Reaction,"The latest in a long line of initial coin offerings, a sale held today for tokens that will power the ethereum prediction market Gnosis is emerging as a novel entry – if not for the reason intended.  Ostensibly designed to discourage the kind of speculation that has come to define ICOs, the resulting sale was arguably anything but usual – concluding in less than 15 minutes and with the creators owning the vast majority of the funds (95% worth more than $280m at press time).  In short, given the choice between waiting to purchase (thereby lowering the purchasing price of the tokens and decreasing the share of founder funds), investors jumped at the chance to buy the tokens that will power the network (now in beta) – just 5% of the project's tokens sold for a combined $12m.  The result has been that Gnosis is attracting significant commentary, with proponents arguing that it shows the strong demand for blockchain project funding and detractors asserting it's merely the latest case of speculation run amok.  To give you an idea of how much was raised, the total valuation was about double the current value of another blockchain prediction market, Augur. Further, ethereum, the blockchain platform on which the decentralized application is based, raised $18m in its original 2014 crowdsale, the largest-ever at the time. (Augur raised $5m in 2015).  The result is that even those who support the project seemed taken aback.  Demian Brenner, project lead at Zeppelin, a firm that does technical due diligence on ICO projects, called the results evidence prediction markets are simply a ""hot area"" of the market.  Others viewed it more as the latest litmus test for assessing the uncharted ICO market. Such a view was put forward by Dan Cawrey, co-founder of blockchain derivatives project Pactum, who compared the project to Augur.  Cawrey told CoinDesk:  ""Both are prediction markets. Both projects are approaching that problem differently. At this point, it's all about the team and how they devise the structure.""  But, it has prompted some worries, with some pointing to the high market cap for the project as an example of the recent ""irrationality"" of token sales. Some have gone so far as to state that investors didn't know the details of what they were investing in, and that a ""redo"" might be order to more equitably distribute the funds.  As indicated in an investor release, Gnosis intends to lock up at least 99% of the funds for at least one year, with more details on how the funds will be used coming in the release.  Dutch auction system  While there have been many crowdsales in the ethereum space (from Augur to Golem), the formula generally goes something like this. First, the team sets a date for the token sale. Then, in most cases, a portion, say 10% of the total tokens, are set aside for the development team to sell as a means to continue engineering the project.  Some token sales, such as SingularTV or Cosmos, have ended in just a matter of minutes or hours, often presumably with big players eating up most of the tokens. (There are signs this may have been the case with Gnosis, according to estimates.) Others have taken months or have been shelved due to inactivity.  So far, these projects have also deployed a number of token distribution models. Usually tokens grow more expensive over time, as they did in e-sports platform First Blood’s ICO.  Gnosis put together a different structure, though, one on which they worked on with ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and developer Alex Van de Sande.  The idea behind the ""dutch-style auctioning system"" was for the tokens to grow less expensive over time, thereby encouraging investors to buy in later, prolonging the time it would take for users to buy up all the tokens.  But, that’s not what happened. Further, Gnosis did not add any cap on the amount of tokens that the team would receive, as is typical for other projects. Rather, the sale was scheduled to end once $12.5m was raised or 9m GNO tokens were sold.  ICO gone wrong?  Because the incentives of the new system didn't work quite as intended, some have gone on to suggest that investors are not rational for buying at such a high price. (Even Slock.it founder and CEO Christoph Jentzsch weighed in with this view.)  Monero developer Riccardo Spagni, a long-time critic of the ICO practice, argued that the Gnosis token sale architects should have expected the crowdsale to play out the way it did, with investors rushing to buy the tokens before others.  ""The choice wasn’t really a choice at all,"" he told CoinDesk. ""It's a little bit of a completely expected selfish choice.""  Still, the quick access to funding has at least one startup founder re-thinking the model. Ryan X Charles, CEO of Yours, a project that aims to use blockchain for content funding, has long sought to sidestep issuing its own token by leveraging the bitcoin blockchain.  Yet, Charles said the funding could help to change his mind, calling the result ""impressive"".  He concluded:  ""I'm becoming much more bullish on cryptocurrency and tokens in general.""

42427480,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKViRh,1493064913,New Bitcoin Core Software Makes SegWit Optional for Miners,"A new software update has been published by the Bitcoin Core open-source development community.  Released on Saturday, version 0.14.1 largely builds on the group's March 0.14.0 release, incorporating a series of fixes to bugs and other tweaks to the code. Bitcoin Core is the standard software for bitcoin, though it has faced new pressure from alternative implementations of late.  As such, one notable inclusion in the release focuses on Segregated Witness, the scaling upgrade debuted in late 2015 at the Scaling Bitcoin conference in Hong Kong, and that has provoked a now months-long debate over network development.  The update to 'getblocktemplate', or the mining protocol that underlies the bitcoin network, effectively enables those operating hardware needed to secure the blockchain to upgrade to 0.14.1 without having to explicitly opt in to SegWit.  As Core maintainer Wladimir van der Laan wrote in a release statement, the change enables miners who aren't running SegWit-compatible software to keep operating normally if the upgrade is adopted network-wide.  Van der Laan went on to explain:  ""In this version, it now supports non-segwit clients even after activation, by removing all segwit transactions from the returned block template. This allows non-segwit miners to continue functioning correctly even after segwit has activated.""  The release also comes at a time when the litecoin network, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by volume, is on the verge of implementing the SegWit code upgrade.

42427490,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVibh,1493051138,"Blockchain Could Expand Central Bank Access, Says Bank of Japan","Central banks could allow access to accounts around the clock if they used blockchains or cryptocurrencies, a senior Bank of Japan official speculated last week.  Speaking during a finance forum on 21st April, deputy governor Hiroshi Nakaso touched on the subject of so-called central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, and their potential impact on how people interact with their accounts at a given time.  One proposal is to offer central bank accounts to retail customers through a CBDC (something that officials at the Bank of England have highlighted in the past). In his speech, Nakaso brought up this idea, suggesting that, depending on the degree of adoption, such an arrangement could give accountholders continuous access to funds.  Nakaso remarked:  ""In an extreme case in which CBDC provides the same functionality as banknotes as an alternate measure, it could enable everyone to access central bank accounts 24/7, year-round. Some overseas central banks have started to consider the rationale for or to conduct researches and analyses on CBDC.""  Many central banks today are testing the concept of a legal tender issued in a wholly digital medium.  In the past month, Hong Kong's de-facto central bank moved to begin testing a CBDC, and in March, authorities in Singapore completed a similar trial. Central banks in Canada, China, Sweden and the UK, among others, also have projects in various states of development.  The Bank of Japan itself has been trialing the tech, noting in statements in December that it was ""test driving"" the concept ahead of any possible applications. Late last year, for example, the Bank of Japan inked a deal with the European Central Bank to collaboratively research blockchain.  Still, the Bank of Japan has been largely mum on the work's potential impact, choosing to emphasize its early and experimental nature.

42427477,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKViFh,1493044836,Bank of Korea: Costs Could Limit Cryptocurrency Use,"South Korea's central bank has published a new working paper on cryptocurrencies.  Drafted by researchers from the Bank of Korea and Seoul's Hongik University, the paper seeks to identify factors that could drive the use of a blockchain-based currency over a government-issued one.  According to the authors, there is likely to be a symbiotic relationship between both economies should digital currencies become more widely used. Namely, when the cost of using one currency rises, the other is likely to fall, they speculate, thereby increasing the attractiveness of the other option.  Yet, they believe costs will keep the systems in balance.  The authors write:  ""High costs of using fiat currency increase the demand for digital currency. Similarly, high costs of using digital currency relative to fiat currency raise the demand for fiat currency. In a world of imperfect currencies with uncertain costs associated with the use of a currency, it is unlikely that the relative costs of using digital currency will be low enough to drive out and accordingly crowd out fiat currency entirely.""  The research fits into a broader trend among central banks, which are investigating the deployment of digital currencies, both by the institutions themselves as well as other groups or organizations.  Indeed, the authors posit that their research could give financial regulators greater insights into these dynamics as such systems become more prevalent.  ""The result of our paper can be useful to policymakers and regulators who want to have insights in the new monetary system where a privately issued digital currency coexists with a central bank issued fiat currency,"" the authors write.  The paper is the latest work for Bank of Korea, which has been among the more vocal and progressive central banks on the issue of blockchain tech.

42427495,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKViph,1493038814,The UN Wants to Adopt Bitcoin And Ethereum – And Soon,"The United Nations (UN) is in the final stages of what could be one of the most epic blockchain projects of all time.  After successfully using the ethereum blockchain to transmit Pakistani rupees to 100 people earlier this year, the UN's World Food Program (WFP) is arranging extra security to ensure it safely executes the next stage of its work.  A pilot test, scheduled to begin in Jordan on 1st May, will see the WFP sending an unspecified number of dinars to more than 10,000 recipients in need of financial support and extra food, with the goal of expanding the number of recipients to 500,000 people by 2018.  To protect the privacy of the recipients, the exact amount to be disbursed is not being revealed. But the technology being developed is part of an even bigger push to make the UN's services so resilient that they could survive even the destruction of the UN itself.  The secret to such a design, according to WFP financial officer Houman Haddad, could be to remove the dinar altogether as a means of distributing funds – along with any other state-issued currency.  ""At the moment we're paying out in normal currencies, so-called fiat currencies,"" said Haddad, who also works with both the WFP's treasury and financial risk management divisions. ""That is mainly because a lot of the places in which we work don't accept either bitcoin or ether.""  He told CoinDesk:  ""However, the ideal would be that if they do, then we could just transfer the cryptocurrencies. It gets rid of the post-payment altogether.""  Called 'Building Blocks', the first successful test of the ethereum-based solution was conducted in January in the Sindh province of Pakistan. There, 100 people received 3,000 rupees and the equivalent value in food via transactions authenticated on the ethereum testnet.  The trial  Created over a 40-day period, the proof-of-concept is the latest effort designed to show that a blockchain could be used to distribute humanitarian aid to those in need.  Beneficiaries of the project were assigned random one-time passwords that displayed on their mobile devices, which were then shown to supermarket proprietors who helped disperse both the funds and food.  At the end of the test, the transaction records on the public ethereum testnet were reconciled with the actual funds distributed.  The procedure flips on its head the idea of cutting out the middleman.  Instead of paying the funds directly to the recipients, the UN sends the money to the shops, cutting out both banks and even the actual recipients.  In one example cited by Haddad, money meant for 100,000 beneficiaries could instead be paid directly to the 400 merchants that might be available in that area.  ""The cost will be lower because there will be fewer transactions, no admin fees and all of that,"" said Haddad. ""The risk will be lower because we don't have to advance money to anyone because we would only pay for actual purchases.""  A second pilot planned for August will see the test expand beyond the borders of Jordan to other nations, with the possibility of reaching tens of millions of recipients served by the WFP in the future.  Cryptocurrency transfers  Yet, both the proof-of-concept and upcoming pilot are part of a larger push within the UN to rethink what the organization calls cash-based transfers (CBT).  Instead of turning over perishable resources such as food and medicine, the UN directly injects money into the local economy in the form of vouchers, prepaid cards, mobile money and more.  In 2015, the program transferred $680m in aid to recipients, a number Haddad said the WFP hopes to increase to $2bn per year. In the first six years of the program, 9.6 million people were given assistance through cash-based transfers.  Though the advantages of CBT include increased efficiency and stimulated trade, there's still plenty room to improve, according to Haddad.  Specifically, he believes the current system still suffers from fees, a lack of privacy for the recipient, risks associated with relying on startup mobile money companies and lengthy contracting processes to ensure payment is still completed in the case these startups fail.  All of these issues, Haddad said, could be reduced by moving the transactions to a blockchain.  As such, the pilot is set to continue over the course of May, and will be conducted on a private version of the ethereum blockchain, with the goal of eventually conducting 1 million transactions per month.  ""If we reach the $2bn mark that we are set to achieve in terms of total spending on cash-based transfer,"" he said, ""we estimate conservatively we could save $20m a year.""  Stronger than the UN  While consortia models have become increasingly popular for financial institutions looking to leverage the network effect of blockchain, the WFP went in a decidedly different direction.  Developed in partnership with the Field Innovation Exchange offered by exponential technology think tank, Singularity University, the pilot is designed as the next step towards increasing internal cooperation between agencies at the UN.  Initially, the project, developed at WFP's Innovation Accelerator, is being built to give store keepers a reliable way to know how much money and food each of their customers can afford.  But project manager Alexandra Alden said she'd eventually like to see applications open up in divisions across the UN, with efforts aimed at cryptographically securing identity, tracking supply chain logistics and leveraging Internet of Things-enabled devices.  Importantly, Alden and Haddad hope that future incarnations of the technology could be built on the public ethereum blockchain, should it grow to be able to handle the necessary transaction volumes.  ""The ideal world would be where beneficiaries have smartphones,"" said Alden. ""They can store their own private key so they can see the transaction history, their entitlements, where the shops are that are selling the goods they want, price analysis of where rice is cheaper.""  To help ensure that the WFP is working closely with government agencies, she added:  ""Our goal is to ideally deal with this in a way that even if the WFP did not exist in 10 years time the beneficiaries could still benefit from the system.""  The future of donations  Haddad breaks down the benefits of blockchain into three categories: empowering beneficiaries, lowering costs and reducing redundancy in the system of UN services.  Unlike previous attempts to collaborate that he said were stunted by internal competitive interests, he believes the blockchain solutions being developed across the UN will someday be able to interoperate because of the common source of data.  Already, UN Women has partnered with Innovation Norway to make it easier for women and girls to explore blockchain, and it is currently hiring a blockchain consultant. In October, the UN publicized its interest in using blockchain for sustainability projects, and in November, the United Nations Children's Fund invested in its first startup working in the sector.  Should the United Nations ever integrate these blockchain efforts and more, Haddad said the potential benefits of reducing a number of redundancies will be limited unless the organization also starts accepting ethereum and other cryptocurrencies as a form of payment from donors.  ""A lot of our people have offered to donate ether,"" he said. ""We can’t accept it at the moment, but being in finance and treasury I'm actually looking at how we can start accepting it.""  Haddad concluded:  ""Then, if we can pay out as well we can offer end-to-end tracking of the money coming in and going out, where it was spent, what it was spent on in a manner that does not intrude on the privacy of the beneficiary.""

42427492,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVijh,1493036144,Why Sweden is Taking a Chance on Blockchain Land Registry,"Could the technology that powers bitcoin be adapted for land titling?  Sweden's land registry authority, the Lantmäteriet, seems to think so, and has emerged as one of the first national agencies to put its faith behind the use case. While there is a steady stream of projects pairing blockchain startups with government agencies, the Lantmäteriet's work is perhaps distinguished by the steady progress it's shown so far.  Working with startup ChromaWay and consultancy Kairos Future, as well as the SBAB and Landshypotek banks, the Lantmäteriet has been testing whether private blockchains can serve as a means of carrying out property transactions since last June.  The goal, according to the authority's head of development, Mats Snäll, is to reinvent the way land titles are registered.  He told CoinDesk:  ""[We] saw that this process was quite conservative. It still consisted of paperwork and such things and [we thought] it would be a good idea to see if that kind of process was possible to change with the help of the blockchain technology.""  The Lantmäteriet, Snäll said, was drawn to the openness and transparency that blockchain technology could potentially offer the agency, as well as Sweden's citizens.  ""Land titling should be public, it should be open, it should be transparent and safe and secure,"" he said.  Blockchain promises  Blockchain proponents have made a lot of big promises around what the technology could do for the public sector, but land titling is also statistically a big concern. Around 70% of the world lacks access to proper land titling, according to the World Bank.  As an alternative to current systems, Lantmäteriet's private blockchain test envisions how to allow buyers, sellers, banks and authorities to track a transaction from beginning to end digitally, instead of using paper contracts, thus making tracking and transparency easier.  The idea is every party would have the information immediately accessible on the blockchain.  To date, Sweden is at perhaps the most advanced stages of blockchain testing for property records (though other countries like Georgia and Honduras have been moving forward with the idea). However, the nation is still a long way off from widely implementing a blockchain land registry platform.  While the trial recently completed its latest phase, the project remain in the exploratory stages.  ""It's a very small trial so far, so ... we don't know if it will work in the wider perspective,"" said Snäll.  Upending the old  Still, Sweden is a developed nation with a land registry system that, while perhaps old-fashioned, is working adequately.  Upending that system with blockchain tech may promise a more efficient way of doing things in the long term, but people may still need some persuasion, according to Snäll.  ""Still people ask, 'What is blockchain?'"" he said. ""It's still to be seen if one is against it or not. Right now most of the people are curious about it.""  The next stage for the parties in trial is to get beyond this 'curiosity' period. Further, the project has not yet tested the blockchain with actual property records.  ""This is something we will need to try in the next phase,"" said Snäll.  Legal barriers  For the banks, too, it's still a case of seeing how everything works.  SBAB Bank told CoinDesk last month that it has no plans to implement the blockchain platform in the immediate future and that the trial remains exploratory  Unsurprisingly, the biggest barrier to changing the land titling system is not the technology itself, but laws and regulations that have been in place for years.  ""The interpretation of the law today is that all the contracts regarding sale, purchase and gifts of property should be stated in contract by paper and pen. In that regard, we need to change the law or change the interpretation of the law if we’re going to have digital contracts,"" Snäll said.  He explained that the Lantmäteriet has already made proposals to the government regarding the issue, adding: ""Slowly we are moving towards some kind of action, I think.""  A spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice, which would oversee such a change, declined to offer additional comment when contacted by CoinDesk.  There is, however, an ongoing government committee run by Sweden's Department of Finance that is examining how legislation can be changed or adapted for digital development.  ""I hope that our area would be covered,"" said Snäll.  Mutual interest  But while the Lantmäteriet has spearheaded the use of the blockchain within the Swedish public sector, it's not alone in its interest.  Other agencies, like the taxation authority, are reaching out to the land registry authority to better understand how blockchain technology works and if it can be applied to their processes for handling information about citizens.  ""Everyone knows we are involved in this project so they have contacted us,"" Snäll said.  Right now, the involved parties are mulling over the next phase of the land registry trials and how they should be developed going forward.  Still, according to Snäll, the next phase of the project won't start until summer or fall.  He concluded:  ""Right now we need some time to explore and to summarize this phase.""

42427481,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKViLh,1493031608,New Blockchain Deal Seeks to Expand Delaware's Business Appeal,"There are more businesses incorporated in Delaware than there are people – a balance the state's leadership hopes blockchain can help change.  Already the location to more than 1 million incorporated businesses, many of which actually conduct their business elsewhere around the world, Delaware believes blockchain has a significant enough global pull that it could inspire companies to set up brick-and-mortar offices in the state.  To that end, Delaware representatives have exclusively revealed to CoinDesk a new partnership with European strategy firm Spitzberg Partners – one designed to leverage the expertise of the firm, as well as its own technological and regulatory development around blockchain, as a means to entice international businesses to set up shop in the state.  Delaware recently reduced its revenue projections for the year. Yet, the injection of capital that could arise from the project has the potential to make a significant impact, according to Andrea Tinianow, the director of state-run business development initiative Delaware Global.  She told CoinDesk:  ""People know about Delaware because companies incorporate here. But, we want people to know that it's more than just where to incorporate, they can do business here and if it's distributed ledger, even better.""  Initially revealed at CoinDesk's Consensus 2016 conference in New York, the Delaware Blockchain Initiative has grown from an effort to build a stock trading solution with New York-based Symbiont to include a number of regulatory measures crafted with the help of law firm Cooley LLP.  Tinianow said the state of Delaware is already being approached by companies all over the world interested in incorporating in Delaware to take advantage of its historically light regulatory touch and its progressive stance on blockchain and other financial technology.  Germany-based Spitzberg Partners, she went on, is already working with its clients to help ""create awareness"" of what they consider the benefits of opening a physical presence in the state, including the absence of state income tax and a chancery court that not only doesn’t use juries, but has proven to be rather knowledgeable regarding blockchain tech.  Tinianow said:  ""This is the first chapter. I think there’s a lot of exciting things that lie ahead.""  European connections  Already, ties exist between Delaware and Spitzberg Partners, which was co-founded by Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, Germany's former Minister of Economics and Technology.  In 2015, the then-state governor, Jack Alan Markell, conducted a trade mission to Germany in search of bilateral trade opportunities, and later helped open Factory Berlin Delaware – a co-working space modeled after an existing German initiative.  To help continue that trend as part of the new partnership with Delaware Global, Ulf Gartzke, Spitzberg's co-founder and managing partner, told CoinDesk his firm will introduce the state to ""corporate decision makers from around the world"".  ""Our role will be to identify companies that are prime candidates to expand to the US,"" said Gartzke. ""And of course, blockchain in one very important part. But we are also looking at other industry verticals.""  Spitzberg's public partners include Toronto-based merchant bank Acasta Capital, Munich-based Ming Labs (which has offices in Shanghai and Singapore), and Zurich-based Mountain Partners.  The firm also has relationships with the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance in New York and distributed financial technology firm Ripple, which has been seeking to grow its presence in Japan and elsewhere from its base in San Francisco.  Going public?  But there's another reason the partnership could end up having an impact not just on Delaware’s local economy, but on the future of public companies.  Part of Spitzberg's role will be to play a match-maker of sorts, finding startups around the world that might want access to more than just Delaware's blockchain-friendly regulations.  The availability of US capital also plays an important role to Delaware's appeal, and the state has been working with Symbiont to develop a blockchain-based way to sell shares in a company.  So, starting in tech hubs like Hamburg, Berlin and Munich, Spitzberg’s Steven Ehrlich says his firm will be looking for mature startups interested in being among the first to go public on a blockchain.  ""There’s going to have to be a critical mass of them before companies start issuing shares and stuff like that,"" said Ehrlich, conceding that it's likely to be more of a ""medium to long-term play"".  Tinianow was positive about the prospect, however, concluding:  ""It’s really not about Delaware, we just want to be the launching pad.""

42427484,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKViVh,1493028009,The Next Phase of the Blockchain Consortium is Here,"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis and corporate finance, and a member of CoinDesk's product team.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.  Few things live up to the hype – that goes for even an uplifting concept like collaboration.  While blockchain consortia have undoubtedly been on the rise, with large groups clocking up new members and smaller ones multiplying, a dose of realism appears to settling in.  Last week, CoinDesk reported on the results of a survey on digital innovation in financial services, in which 200 executives from large banks and investment firms were asked their opinion on the benefits of collaboration.  Over 70% saw industry consortia as vital for the development of solutions. However, a similar percentage had serious reservations about the format, from incentives to the lack of control. Over 60% believed that joining could negatively impact competitive advantage, and that existing groups had too many participants to be effective.  Does this mean we are on the verge of a shift in sentiment?  Rather than point to an imminent slump in expectations, though, the results could indicate a pending realignment of the blockchain sector.  The departure from R3 last year of a few early members hinted at the difficulties inherent in large associations. From conflicting priorities to governance roadblocks, bigger is not always better when it comes to getting things done.  The large consortia seem to realize that. Most of the work going on in R3 is within small teams, in essence producing a fragmentation of the pool. And Hyperledger recently formed two thematic working groups, one for healthcare and another focused on China.  This does not mean that their days are numbered. For their breadth and reach, the industry's giants are in an ideal position to develop standards for the sector. And their clout makes them an essential counterparty to negotiations with regulators.  Thinking small  At the same time, small consortia are taking on a greater role.  The tech arm of financial giant Fidelity surprised the market last week by joining the small yet focused IC3, instead of one of the larger groups like most of its peers. Other sector-specific associations are focusing on use-case testing that is likely to reach production in the short term, solving concrete needs.  The proliferation of smaller groups could accelerate as both Microsoft and Samsung recently launched platforms aimed at making consortium creation easier.  The increasingly public discussion of the difficulties of consortia governance does not mean that the model is flawed. It is a sign that the concept is maturing, which implies a deeper awareness of the problems that need solving.  New evolution  Large groups will continue to have an important role to play, but this will evolve as the ecosystem continues to grow.  Small groups will pick up an increasing share of the work, and businesses looking to explore the technology and its impact will most likely end up joining more than one consortium as requirements become more focused.  After all, the underlying technology calls for collaboration. Its strength derives from being able to share information in a decentralized manner (even if the decentralization is limited) without having to worry about veracity and permanence.  Without consortia, network effects will be difficult to achieve. Businesses that would prefer to continue operating in a centralized silo might as well use a database.  The consortia landscape is not doomed. It's not even hitting a speed bump. It is evolving.

42427485,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKViTh,1493024410,AT&T Explores Cryptocurrency Car Payments in New Patent Filing,"Digital currency payments in motor vehicles may not be far off, if the ideas in a new patent application from telecom giant AT&T enter real-world use.  Yesterday, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) released the application, dubbed ""Vehicle System with System Report Generation and Methods For Use Therewith"". Within this innocuously titled document, however, is a concept for integrating cryptocurrency payments into vehicles, attributed to AT&T Mobility, a subsidiary of the firm.  Here’s how the patent’s description explains it:  ""A processor is configured to perform operations including generating a vehicle report based on the vehicle data; generating in accordance with a cryptocurrency protocol, a digital currency record that is unique to the vehicle report, wherein the digital currency record indicates a digital currency value associated with the vehicle report. The digital currency record is stored in a memory and communicated in conjunction with a purchase of goods or services by the user, wherein the digital currency value is credited to a purchase price of the goods or services.""  Notably, the application distinguishes between blockchain-based cryptocurrencies and other iterations of electronic money – though, in the case of Beenz and e-gold, some them are currencies that did not stand the test of time.  Specific cryptocurrencies mentioned include bitcoin and monero, among others.  The application goes on to conceptualize what these payments may actually entail, including what are essentially micropayments that occur depending on what happens during a drive.  ""For example, an hour highway driving may be worth only one dollar, but identification of a pothole, a damaged road sign or malfunctioning traffic signal may increase the value by differing amounts, based on the condition detected,"" the application explains.  The submission is AT&T’s second related to the technology. In October, the USPTO released a patent application for a kind of home subscriber server that utilizes a blockchain.
