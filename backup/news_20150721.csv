42398530,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbUpuc,1437516129,Coin.mx Execs Arrested for Operating Illegal Bitcoin Exchange,"UPDATE (22nd July 3:10am BST): This article has been updated with a signed complaint against Anthony Murgio.      Two operators of the bitcoin exchange service Coin.mx are being charged by US prosecutors for working without a money transmission license.  Anthony Murgio and Yuri Lebedev have been accused of operating Coin.mx in violation of federal anti-money laundering statutes. The charges were unveiled today by the US Attorney's Office of the Southern District of New York.  Murgio was charged with one count of money laundering and one count of willful failure to file a suspicious activity report. Both Murgio and Lebedev were charged with one count of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and one count of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. The case will be held in the Middle District of Florida.  According to a statement from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, which collaborated with the US Secret Service on its investigation of Coin.mx, Murgio and Lebedev were accused of knowingly handling funds tied to bitcoin ransomware attacks.  The agency noted:  ""In doing so, Murgio, and his co-conspirators knowingly enabled the criminals responsible for those attacks to receive the proceeds of their crimes, yet, in violation of federal anti-money laundering laws, Murgio never filed any suspicious activity reports regarding any of the transactions.""  The operators were accused of unlawfully transmitting hundreds of thousands of dollars overseas, and face decades in prison apiece if convicted.  Federal prosecutors alleged that in order to conceal the true nature of the company, Coin.mx operated via a ""Collectables Club"" entity based in Florida. Rather than ""customers"", Coin.mx claimed to service ""members"" who engaged in exchange activities.  Federal prosecutors further alleged that, in order to avoid possible regulatory problems, Murgio gained control of a New Jersey-based credit union through which Coin.mx conducted its banking activities, making it a ""captured bank"" through which to transfer funds.  The National Credit Union Administration is said to have uncovered the activity and compelled the unnamed credit union to stop acting as a banking service for Coin.mx. The operators then went on to utilize alternative, international payment processing services thereafter.  The Coin.mx website was unavailable at press time. Users reported earlier today that the site was inaccessible.  Link to Wall Street bank hacks  Federal investigators also unveiled charges against four other individuals with connections to Murgio that were involved in a stock pump-and-dump scheme.  Those individuals are said to be involved in high-profile cyberattacks on Wall Street banks including JP Morgan Chase and four others that took place in 2014. At the time, the assailants were able to access JP Morgan's systems and abscond with sensitive customer data before being discovered.  According to Bloomberg News, Murgio was named in a previously undisclosed FBI memo related to the cyberattacks.  CoinDesk is monitoring this developing story and will post updates as information becomes available.

42398548,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbUpvb,1437515160,Bitcoin Exchange itBit Launches OTC Trading Desk,"ItBit has launched its Global OTC Agency Trading Desk, a new, five-person over-the-counter (OTC) trading service that allows customers to complete trades outside its online order books.  The trading desk will facilitate transactions of 100 BTC (roughly $28,000 at press time) or more with no broker or trading fees. As part of a limited promotion, new users will also receive $50 in bitcoin for completing their first trade.  ItBit Institutional Client Group director Bobby Cho noted that the new product aims to appeal to large volume buyers who want to avoid exchange slippage, whereby their purchase moves the price of the market.  A former vice president at fellow bitcoin OTC trading services provider SecondMarket, now Genesis Trading, Cho suggested that the services could compliment one another given their variances in approach.  Cho told CoinDesk:  ""They're a broker dealer, we don't take positions. They may buy or take a position. Our incentive is to drive more transactions and more trading volume, and the end goal here is to bring price discovery to the OTC market so as a trader you can see volumes, but there's also this separate OTC market that there is no data around.""  Cho specified that OTC clients will need to go through know your customer (KYC) verification, though this process will be same as for online-only clients.  The new product further comes amid a time of increasing activity in New York's bitcoin sector following the passage of the BitLicense and ahead of the expected launch of the Winklevoss Capital backed exchange Gemini.  Still, Cho sees the services being able to coexist given what he characterized as the expanding market for bitcoin.  ""We haven't felt the competition yet, we know the bitcoin market is still young and large enough for multiple players involved, you want competitors to validate your business model,"" Cho said. ""I think competition is good and healthy.""

42398528,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbUpse,1437512762,Why Bitcoin Should Embrace Stupidity,"My first memory of the Internet involves four rows of pixelated hamsters, spinning and gyrating to music that sounds like it's scraping your brain.  It was the late 1990s or maybe early 2000s, my family used EarthLink via a dial-up connection. I think we had a Compaq computer. Being only recently born, I found the website amusing, I shared it with my family, I laughed about it with friends. I probably watched it hundreds of times.  I admit this because, some fifteen years later, I still remember the website Hampster Dance. I can sing you the song. Being now older and burdened with the need for a certain serious disposition to the world, I've been thinking a lot about this experience in the context of bitcoin (and the blockchain) and the struggles of its advocates to communicate its value.  So, I want to take this time to talk about Hampster Dance. I want us to talk about Hampster Dance in order to highlight the extreme power of extremely dumb ideas. The Internet was communication, in all its raw, rambling and insane forms, and Hampster Dance is one of its finest early examples.  Maybe I knew I was using the Internet, and maybe I could distinguish that from a plastic and metal computer. I'm not sure. I certainly didn't know I was using protocols. I didn't care that the website's content was made possible by a GIF or a WAV file or even a browser.  At the time, such details weren't important. In nine seconds, every time I got exactly what I wanted, the same ecstatic burst of absurdity, animation and sound – and I understood.  For all its faults, Hampster Dance did something no teacher could have done, and beautifully – it distilled the complexity of an education process to its purest form, its message able to be easily replicated, digested and communicated with the click of a button.  If you look close enough, you can see the seeds of Netflix, Tumblr and a hundred other innovations, all in the magic of these endlessly dancing hamsters.  Clever and stupid  One of the classic lines in 1984's This is Spinal Tap comes when lead singer David St Hubbins responds to an album cover disagreement.  He realizes that he made a mistake, that the original cover (featuring a lewd drawing of a woman and a glove) was too offensive, but that a subtle change could have pleased the studio execs. If it had been he who was made to ""smell the glove"", it might have worked.  ""It's such a fine line between stupid and clever,"" he says, and he's right.  So far in the bitcoin industry, there seems to be a widespread hesitation against exploring this line. Dogecoin was derided until its joke was pronounced dead and its founders chased out of the industry. Other meme-focused altcoins came and went. The industry hasn't really recovered from this funny bone fracture since.  There's still a pull against taking stupidity seriously, despite evidence of its effectiveness. As our most recent State of Bitcoin report showcases, ""bitcoin billionaire"" was the fastest-growing search term related to bitcoin over the last 12 months.  The term doesn't relate to the promise of bitcoin as a speculative investment or hedge in times of currency crisis.  Bitcoin Billionaire is rather an online game that simulates bitcoin mining and rewards users with fake wealth. The game has a four-and-a-half star review on the Google App store and five stars on iTunes. One video guide to the game has nearly 500,000 views on YouTube.  A better example is the recently launched website Eternity Wall, one of the best examples so far of a single-serving bitcoin-based website. It's message is simple. Write a message, it will last forever. As my fellow writer Grace Caffyn quipped, it's ""restroom graffiti"" for the bitcoin age.  So far the wall is littered with stupidity, with words like ""fart"", proclamations of who is ""the best DJ"" and boring statements of approval like ""cool"".  There's even one guy slamming the service for generating ""blockchain spam"" by using small transactions to tie the messages to bitcoin's distributed ledger. The message is implicit: this stupidity is getting in the way of the serious stuff.  Societal change  I'll take a moment to digress and clarify, that the intent is not to suggest that bitcoin itself is dumb or stupid, or that the ecosystem's larger attempts to make the world a better place are in any way not admirable or well-intentioned.  I won't even argue there's a legitimate argument against blockchain spam, that you probably wouldn't want a copy of Hampster Dance stored on every server in the world. At that point, let's be frank, you might be overpaying to secure the Hampster Dance website.  I'm sure bitcoin and the blockchain will be everything we want it to be. It will likely be greatly transformative. The Hernando de Soto, MIT vision of the blockchain will probably come to pass – land title records will be digitized, complex financial assets will trade at the speed of emails.  Bitcoin and the blockchain will impact the wider world in ways we can't imagine. Just as the Internet enabled Twitter to play a role in the Arab Spring movement, change will be inherent in our use of transaction systems that rely on participation, that lack central guiding authorities.  Change will come and it will likely be slow and tangential, only observable later when we look at things at certain angles, because the nature of change is for it to be absorbed.  I've written in this space for two years now. I don't say much often. I am content to watch and listen and observe. I want the industry to get there, but I want it to remember how I came to the Internet, and for us to maybe remember a bit about ourselves.  We are human beings. Humor is how we learn, it's how we make sense, it's how we understand. Help us understand. Do it in the messiest and most annoying way possible, and if possible, don't be afraid of dancing hamsters.

42398549,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbUpzX,1437509151,Inside R3CEV's Plot to Bring Distributed Ledgers to Wall Street,"About a year ago, R3CEV founder David Rutter and partner Todd McDonald traveled to California to survey the growing landscape of digital currency startups for potential investment opportunities. After days of meeting with numerous companies – in addition to back-and-forth trips on the highway – Rutter says that he had a moment of deja vu.  “I had seen it before where a lot of money – a lot of California-based venture money – was being thrown at PowerPoints and half-baked ideas about how this new technology was going to change finance as we know it,"" he recalled.  A 30-year veteran of Wall Street and former CEO of Electronic Broking at interdealer broker ICAP Plc, Rutter said that what came out of that trip to California was a decision to eschew the ideas of radical change enabled by cryptocurrencies to instead look for problems that could potentially be solved by the use of a distributed ledger.  He told CoinDesk:  “The journey we decided to take was to build a knowledge base on what's out there so we can go talk intelligently to big banks about the potential and get their perspective and try to build a thesis around where blockchain technologies could make a mark.”  In a new interview, Rutter and McDonald outlined how R3CEV has been playing a quiet yet concerted game to bring blockchain technology to the world’s largest banks and financial institutions.  The difference between R3CEV and other distributed ledger startups, however, might lie in the strength of its team. The company boasts IBM executive architect Richard Gendal Brown, Open Mustard Seed chief architect Patrick Deegan, bitcoin industry pundit Tim Swanson and former Bank of America, Citi and Wells Fargo employee Raja Ramachandran among its advisors.  Solutions for problems  In interview, both Rutter and McDonald suggested that it's too early to say how Wall Street institutions and financial companies might one day introduce or integrate blockchain technologies.  R3's approach has involved hosting roundtable discussions with interested banks, seeding proof-of-concept initiatives and working directly with institutions on exploration projects.  Specific projects teased by R3 include a peer-to-peer streaming network for US Treasuries. Rutter noted during the interview that among the potential uses of the technology for banks would entail same-day settlement of trades for Treasuries and other securities.  Part of this process has meant operating somewhat in the background – a strategic choice that Rutter attributed to the team's desire to work rather that seeking any kind of limelight.  ""There’s an awful lot of hoopla out there about what's going on in the space, and our view is that we want to make substantial progress that we can speak to,"" he said.  R3 isn't the only firm in the space looking to capitalize on rising interest in blockchain technologies among the financial sector.  Digital Asset Holdings  , led by former JPMorgan exec Blythe Masters, recently unveiled a number of product initiatives that includes same-day settlement systems, and companies like Hyperledger, Ripple Labs and others have long targeted the financial sector as a key client demographic.  At stake are the millions of dollars – if not billions – worth of new business models and financial products built using the technology. As such, players in the space are moving to establish influence among the institutions that could find see big changes in the decades ahead if blockchains and distributed ledgers see broader usage.  Challenging Silicon Valley  Whether bitcoin or another implementation of the protocol will be utilized by one or another bank is still very much unclear.  Rutter and McDonald stressed that they strive for a degree of agnosticism when looking at distributed ledger tech, eschewing the bitcoin maximalist view broadly propagated by others in the industry.  McDonald characterized R3 as taking as a ""balanced approach"", one in which bitcoin as well as other iterations of the technology are equally weighed when looking at particular implementations or use cases.  He went on to suggest that this view stands in contrast with the thinking of some in Silicon Valley:  “They see it as kind of a skeleton key for all the world’s problems, to be applied to everything. We think there’s a lot of interesting aspects around bitcoin and proof of work blockchain and we continue to look at different applications for it.”  The key, the two stressed, was approaching applications from the perspective of a financial institution looking to experiment and integrate, rather than with how the technology could be used to augment the institution from the outside.  Educating banks  These days, it seems harder to find a bank or financial institution that hasn’t committed resources to exploring bitcoin and its underlying technology.  Numerous banks have made public their experimentations, and working groups and trade organizations have weighed in on how blockchain technology, if applied, could bring about lasting change to the financial system. Even central banks like the Monetary Authority of Singapore have begun devoting financial resources to exploring the blockchain.  Many banks and financial institutions, it seems, are still in an exploratory phase, wherein the risks and rewards are being weighed on a case-by-case basis.  Rutter explained:  “The thing for us is, we try to approach this in a way where we try to understand what the pain points are the for banks and where they’d like to see help and then, look and articulate a potential strategy using distributed ledgers to bring value.”  Rutter noted that, for a number of those on Wall Street, the ascendence of bitcoin has sparked a broader movement to embrace cryptographic solutions in finance.  ""I think that it’s possible that these new technologies will provide ancillary benefits,"" he said. 'They're not specific to the distributed ledger, but people are thinking of applying mathematical, cryptographic solutions to existing problems.”  Notable is the speed at which financial institutions worldwide have moved to understand the potential of distributed ledger usage, and the potential applications therein.  “I think the education process and the interest has grown extremely rapidly in the past six months,"" McDonald said.

42398519,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbUpkm,1437497802,Research: Banks Unprepared For Digital Disruption,"Banks are not prepared for the wave of disruption from digital companies seeking to capture the financial market, according to new research.  In a survey of senior executives from the UK's retail banking and wealth management sectors, digital innovation agency Adaptive Lab found that legacy technology and rapidly changing consumer behaviour were hampering innovation.  Commenting on the findings, James Hayock, managing director at the firm, noted the disruptive potential of bitcoin's distributed ledger:  ""The incumbents will get displaced by new entrants offering a better customer experience and price ... their revenues will diminished in a market of higher switching frequency as they're relegated to undifferentiated utilities, before finally their core competency of storing and transferring value is challenged by the arrival of new technology – the blockchain will disintermediate the banks completely.""  Additionally, the research also revealed that banks currently place too much emphasis on compliance – both in terms of focus and resources – with it taking up between 50% and 90% of their IT budgets.  ""It's plain to see that a perfect storm of competition, technology, shifts in customer behaviour and regulation looks set to wreak havoc on the businesses we trust with our money.

First launched in September 2013, CoinDesk's BPI provides the most accurate bitcoin price using an average from the world's leading exchanges.  Boasting a BTC/USD combined trading volume of approximately $3.6m in the last 24 hours, Coinbase and itBit join previously approved exchanges Bitstamp, Bitfinex, BTC-e and OKCoin.  Jon Matonis  , editorial board member at CoinDesk, commented on the integration:  ""Coinbase and itBit have each demonstrated consistent volume and growth over a significant period of time to warrant inclusion in the CoinDesk BPI. Additionally, they have met or exceeded the minimum stated criteria for exchanges to be considered.""  Matonis added the inclusion was not expected to have a major impact on the reported index value, given that both itBit and Coinbase trade fairly in line with the existing components.  ""However, one immediate benefit is that companies and services relying upon the CoinDesk BPI will have a more robust, representative index that is less likely to be dominated by a single regional exchange house and less subject to market anomalies,"" concluded Matonis.  To join the Bitcoin Price Index, bitcoin exchanges are required to submit a questionnaire and meet specific industry criteria; including servicing an international customer base and allowing minimum trades of less than $1,500 or equivalent.  Industry validation  The inclusion of Coinbase in CoinDesk's BPI comes after the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) based its bitcoin price index on transactions taking place on Coinbase's exchange.  Adam White, vice president of business development at Coinbase, said:  ""Including Coinbase in the CoinDesk BPI represents another step forward in the continued adoption of bitcoin and related technologies into the financial system, and helps provide further transparency to the bitcoin ecosystem.""  In May, itBit became the first bitcoin exchange credited with receiving a trust company charter from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).  Commenting on the rationale behind itBit's addition into CoinDesk's BPI, marketing director Ben Pousty said: ""As the first and only regulated bitcoin exchange available to US customers nationwide, as well as traders around the world, itBit is a trusted platform within the industry.""",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,CoinDesk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/07/21/coindesk-adds-coinbase-and-itbit-to-bitcoin-price-index,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d976cfb25cccaa196ef7df00b20038c47accbbc4-1500x1161.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398518,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbUpjn,1437477608,Coinffeine Launches P2P Bitcoin Exchange in Over 70 Countries,"Coinffeine has launched its decentralised open-sourced P2P bitcoin exchange in over 70 countries.  By integrating with Russia-based payment processor OKPay, the Spanish company has enabled bitcoin enthusiasts to purchase and sell the digital currency in countries including Russia, China, Indonesia, Brazil and the Eurozone.  Speaking about the launch, Alberto Gomez Toribio, the company's CEO, said:  ""We want our customers to be those who simply have a PayPal-like account and want to buy or sell bitcoins in a simple and effective way.""  The launch follows the release of Coinffeine's decentralised technical preview version in April, which sought to familiarise developers and early bitcoin adopters with the platform.  How it works  According to its website, Coinffeine uses bitcoin's decentralised nature to create a secure way for people to exchange the digital currency with an untrusted third party.  When users download Coinffeine's desktop wallet app, they can sign in and link their account with their OKPay account.  Users hold bitcoin in their desktop wallet and they deposit fiat into their OKPay account, which means Coinffeine never handles its customers' funds.  By not handling or holding customer's bitcoin or fiat deposits, Coinffeine is not required to enforce Know-Your-Customer (KYC) guidelines, simplifying user registration and lowering operational costs.  Not having to identify users, Gomez said, has allowed for a much more scalable business model. ""Coinffeine is like BitTorrent, you just download it, connect your OKPay account ... and use it.""  When asked about monetisation, Gomez noted that Coinffeine – which received funding from Spanish bank Bankinter's Innovation Foundation – bases its business model on revenue share agreements with payment processors and bank partnerships.  Coinffeine is not currently charging fees, but the CEO noted that OKPay would charge a 0.5% commission for bitcoin purchases.  Given the platform is still in beta, users are currently recommended to ""spend moderate amounts of money"".
