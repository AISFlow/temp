42431887,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN7Hfh,1588894837,Bitcoin Breaches $10K for First Time Since February,"Bitcoin (BTC) rallied Thursday on high volumes, trading above $10,000 for the first time since Feb. 24 late in the day.      The bellwether cryptocurrency surged nearly 7% in 24 hours to $10,071 as of 23:47 UTC (7:47 p.m. ET), with most of those gains made in the last 12 hours. The price was flitting on both sides of the $10,000 threshold as of press time.      The rally means investors who purchased bitcoin at the beginning of the year would now be up almost 40% on their investment. The rise comes after a massive crypto market selloff in March, as the economic fallout from COVID-19 battered both traditional and new, alternative financial markets. As of press time, the S&P 500 stock index is still down 10% year-to-date.      Larger-than-usual bitcoin buying volumes on spot exchanges like Coinbase rapidly pushed up the price for 1 BTC starting around 13:00 UTC (9 a.m. ET) Thursday.      Increased discussion around the bitcoin halving, an event expected May 11 which reduces supply generated by miners, has made the world's oldest cryptocurrency top of mind for many investors. This includes hedge fund legend Paul Tudor Jones II, who announced Thursday his $38 billion Tudor Investment Corp. is buying bitcoin futures products to gain exposure to the crypto market as a hedge against expected inflation.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/07/bitcoin-breaches-10k-for-first-time-since-february,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e9345f586c3d75dc21fd3c71499d988d7f6114b5-747x488.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a press release, Miami resident Daniel Fingerhut; Israeli nationals Tal Valariola and Itay Barak; and the latter two's companies Digital Platinum Limited, Digital Platinum Inc. and Huf Mediya conducted a five-year-long trading scheme, promising investors massive profits without actually delivering between 2013 and 2018.

42431901,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN7IBh,1588883462,Market Wrap: Bitcoin at $9.9K as Halving Chatter Increases,"The price of bitcoin continues its rise ahead of next week’s anticipated halving. That event is trending as a topic on social media, even as few appear to be considering what may happen after it's over.       At press time bitcoin (BTC) was trading up 6.5% over 24 hours, currently at $9,882. It’s been on a run upward on high volume since 12:00 UTC (8 a.m. ET), moving from $9,270 during that time to as high as $9,971 on spot exchanges like Coinbase.      Discussion of “bitcoin halving,” the once-every-four-year event that will lower by half the supply of new bitcoins awarded to miners, has spiked higher than ever over the past week, according to social media data tracked by data aggregator LunarCRUSH. “After months of suppression, mentions of the bitcoin halving event on social media have now exploded,” Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics, noted in a tweet.      Bitcoin’s price climb could be partially attributed to new investor interest in the midst of the recent economic tumult, says Matthew Ficke, head of market development for cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin. “This halving has received an incredible amount of publicity, far surpassing previous halvings particularly against the backdrop of the traditional financial markets.”      Read More: Bitcoin Halving Explained 2020      Many newer crypto investors see that, historically, bitcoin's price has gone much higher, and it can rise to those levels again, Ficke points out. “BTC/USD topped out around $10,400 in October 2019 and February 2020, so it is reasonable to view this as a short-term attraction.”      Ficke may be right about the halving being of short-term interest to investors. Darius Sit, partner at Singapore-based trading firm QCP Capital, is not bullish on a soaring post-halving bitcoin price.      “Regarding halving, we hold the view that impact on price might not be material,” said Sit.      Demand-side buying before the halving has been attributed to “fear of missing out,” or FOMO, as one driver in the crypto market right now. But can it last? Sit is skeptical. “Daily mined supply to 900 BTC, or just under $7 million at these levels, is a small fraction of the current daily trading volume. BTC price would be driven more by demand-side than supply-side dynamics,” he said.      That supply-side dynamic of the mining business might not look good either, as miners are going to have to make some operational decisions once the halving is complete.      Read more: Bitcoin Halving Searches on Google Hits All-Time Highs      Many mining machines will become worthless for bitcoin mining because they won't be profitable after the reward drops from 12.5 to 6.25 BTC, said Zach Resnick, partner at crypto investment firm Unbounded Capital. “Bitcoin miner revenue will go down by close to 50% once the block subsidy is cut in half, which means for all but the most professionalized miners BTC mining will become unprofitable overnight absent a significant run-up in the price.""      That could mean bitcoin selling might be on the way from smaller miners who can’t hack the halving’s reduction in crypto inflow. “Our view is that the less-efficient miners might capitulate and sell their BTC holdings,” QCP’s Sit told CoinDesk.    Other markets    Digital assets on CoinDesk’s big board are up on Thursday. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), gained 3.8% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Cryptocurrency winners include neo (NEO) in the green by 7.2%, monero (XMR) up 7% and dogecoin (DOGE) out of the doghouse, up 5.6%. The lone loser is lisk (LSK) in the red 1.5%.

Europe’s FTSE Eurotop 100 index of the continent’s largest publicly traded companies closed up less than a percent. In Asia, the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo opened trading for the first time this week after a holiday had the markets closed and was up less than a percent with gains in transportation and real estate.

""I think people don't fully appreciate the enormous logistics involved with moving data at a massive scale,"" Ian Darrow, head of operations at Filecoin, told CoinDesk in an interview.      The Filecoin Foundation is inviting anyone to join its ""mission to improve the internet,"" Darrow said in a press statement. The new program is called Filecoin Discover, and it is seeding the file storage network early with what Filecoin calls ""verified datasets.""      This data will be delivered to future miners physically, on eight-terabyte hard drives, with instructions on how to link the devices to the Filecoin system, which should go live this year. (In a post last month on the project’s cryptoeconomics, Filecoin explained why the physical delivery of data was more efficient.)      Filecoin was one of the biggest initial coin offerings (ICOs) of 2017, raising approximately $257 million as one of several projects out of Protocol Labs.    Getting in early    Each hard drive will cost $265 but presumably future Filecoin miners expect storing that much data will ultimately be worth the upfront cost in fiat.      There may be some advantage to being early on Filecoin, according to the recent cryptoeconomics post, but when the network is small, some block rewards will also be deferred, in order to align miner incentives with user needs.      The datasets available through Discover are in the public interest, offered by the Filecoin Foundation as a way of advancing its mission to make humanity's data robust and accessible. The company hopes the nature of the data and the support that comes with it will help attract new, smaller users to the network.      Read more: 12 Markets Crypto Decentralization Can Actually Improve      That said, future miners will need to understand that mining for Filecoin is different than other kinds of mining. It's not just putting in work but being continuously accessible.      ""As a Filecoin miner, you are storing specific pieces of real data for real people, so you do want that data to be reliably available,"" Darrow said.      At 8 terabyte, Darrow noted, this is feasible for someone to set up in their home. While it is a technical process, it comes with instructions and the team is optimistic that by following them users will be ready to run their first hard drive and become interested in expanding their participation. Having lots of smaller users helps make the network more decentralized.

42431894,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN7Hph,1588877461,Tradeshift Proposes Plan to Protect Denmark’s Supply Chains From COVID-19 Crisis,"Tradeshift, the digital trade finance platform that uses blockchain to make payments instant and transparent, has proposed a scheme to the government of Denmark that will free billions of dollars from supply chains, the startup says.      The COVID-19 crisis, like the 2008 financial crisis, has seen companies stretch payment terms and try to preserve cash, which causes a ripple effect down the supply chain and makes the overall situation steadily worsen.      Tradeshift’s plan is to motivate big companies that have applied the brakes, to pay their suppliers instantly rather than delaying, thus preventing further calcification of supply chains and possibly keeping many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from going under.      There is a cost involved in this, however. Offering the necessary additional credit lines to 250 of the biggest exporters operating in Denmark – as a carrot to get them to pay their suppliers immediately – would cost about 1.5 billion DKK (US$217 million) in interest, which Tradeshift is asking the Danish government to stump up.      In return, this would release about 385 billion DKK ($55 billion) over the coming months, says Tradeshift, which is already working with the government’s Danish Export Credit Agency (EKF) as part of a COVID-19 scheme to ensure trade finance insurance remains in place.      “We need to change the fundamental instinctive behavior of corporates in the current situation,” said Tradeshift co-founder Mikkel Hippe Brun. “These are very solid companies that will survive the COVID-19 crisis. The risk of providing them with extra liquidity so they can save their supply chain is very low.”      The media office of the Government of Denmark did not return requests for comment by press time.      Read more: Tradeshift Says It's Slashed Cross-Border Transaction Costs Using Ethereum      The Danish-born, San Francisco-based Tradeshift, which built the first “e-invoicing” scheme in Denmark, has been implementing instant payment programs for years, digitalizing the whole trade process to accelerate payments between big buyers and their suppliers. Over the past two years, the unicorn-status startup has added blockchain to its tech armory, providing an even more transparent and easily auditable system for invoices and purchase orders.      “All of the COVID-19 programs we are doing in Denmark come at a cost to the taxpayer. This is one of the cheapest things you can do in any economy,” said Hippe Brun, citing the work of Aarhus University economics professor Philipp Schröder, who is involved in Denmark’s COVID-19 response planning. “What we need now is the government to step in, to provide insurance for the economy, but also help out and incentivize the corporates to pay now.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/05/07/tradeshift-proposes-plan-to-protect-denmarks-supply-chains-from-covid-19-crisis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3a5f22979dcf5b1de42cdd835413cbb79e8e020d-1500x995.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Jones’ Tudor BVI Global Fund, managed by Tudor Investment Corp., has been authorized to hold as much as “a low single-digit percentage exposure percentage"" of its assets in bitcoin futures, according to a note sent to investors this month. The firm manages $38 billion, of which $22 billion is in the flagship BVI fund. Bloomberg News reported the disclosure earlier Thursday.      It is not clear from the letter whether Tudor's fund has begun buying futures, what kind (physically delivered or cash-settled), on which exchange it would do so or whether it plans to also trade the underlying commodity. Reached by CoinDesk, a spokesperson for Tudor had no immediate comment.      Jones was one of the first well-known hedge fund managers, having started Tudor Investment Corporation in 1980 at the age of 25. He made a name – and a substantial return — for himself by correctly calling the 1987 crash and then shorting Japanese equities a couple of years later just before that market collapsed.      See also: Investors in Polychain Capital’s Crypto Hedge Fund Saw 1,332% Gains – If They Stomached the Dips      He has since become an elder statesmen of sorts for the hedge fund world and his philanthropic endeavor, the Robin Hood Foundation, boasts finance titans and celebrities on its board.      Bitcoin reminds Jones of gold in the 1970s, according to the letter. Through the early 1970s, gold experienced an acute rally from $35 per ounce in 1971 to a peak of $180 in late 1974.      Unprecedented central bank monetary policy amid the coronavirus crisis is a primary reason for Jones’ interest in bitcoin. What he referred to as the ongoing “Great Monetary Inflation” left him, a market veteran, speechless. It’s an “unprecedented expansion of every form of money unlike anything the developed world has ever seen,” Jones wrote to his clients.      Jones’ statement comes amid a new all-time high in CME bitcoin futures open interest, which nearly reached $400 million on Wednesday, according to Skew. Bitcoin also rallied nearly 10% on Thursday, climbing from $9,000 to just below $9,900 at the time of publication.      A low-single-digit percentage of the Tudor BVI fund's assets would be equivalent to nearly all open interest in CME bitcoin futures contracts at the time of publication.      Amid much discussion on monetary policy in his letter, Jones inserted a subjective ranking of certain assets by their ability to store value, based on a poll of his research group. With 100 as the maximum and best score, Jones' team ranked Bitcoin at 43, the worst score relative to gold, cash, and financial assets.      ""What was surprising to me was not that Bitcoin came in last, but that it scored as high as it did,"" he wrote. Its score, as a proportion of the other categories, was higher than the cryptocurrency's market cap as a proportion of the others. ""Something appears wrong here and my guess is it is the price of Bitcoin.""      Writing to clients, Jones said, “I am not a hard-money nor a crypto nut.” But Jones sees the most compelling argument for investing in Bitcoin as “the coming digitization of currency everywhere, accelerated by Covid-19.”  Note: This article has been updated with additional information from Paul Tudor Jones' investor letter, which you can read in full below.

The acquisition comes at a time when Zoom has been criticized for privacy and security issues, and is part of Zoom’s 90-day push to make the platform more secure. Past privacy issues have included sharing data with Facebook, Zoombombing and claiming calls were encrypted when they were not. The price and terms of the acquisition were not made public.      “We are working on a detailed cryptographic design to be published by May 22 for public review,” tweeted, Alex Stamos, a former chief information security officer of Facebook who joined Zoom as a consultant. “This will be an open and transparent design process as Zoom builds something both unique and impactful to the privacy of millions.”      See also: Public Opinion Shifts on Big Tech and Privacy During Pandemic      Keybase, the secure messaging and file sharing platform, is taking on a challenging task because multiparty video conferencing is incredibly difficult to encrypt end to end, the process where only the communicating users can read the messages, when a large number of people are involved. It’s the reason so few large group-video conferencing platforms offer it. Facetime and WhatsApp, two services that feature end-to-end encryption, are able to do so for only a couple of people at a time, or in the case of WhatsApp, no more than four individuals can use it at once. End-to-end encryption prevents data such as calls, videos, and text messages from being read by someone other than the sender and recipient, including the platform hosting the communications.       In a blog post from Keybase announcing the acquisition, the company said it would be in touch if anything changed with the Keybase app. It also laid out what the next immediate steps would be for the company.       “Initially, our single top priority is helping to make Zoom even more secure,” Keybase said. “There are no specific plans for the Keybase app yet. Ultimately, Keybase's future is in Zoom's hands, and we'll see where that takes us. Of course, if anything changes about Keybase’s availability our users will get plenty of notice.”      The post adds the most immediate actions will be to significantly improve “our security effectiveness, by working on a product that's much bigger than Keybase. We can't be more specific than that because we're just diving in.”      See also: As Pandemic Decimates Startups, Privacy Industry Holds Strong      Currently, the plan is for the end-to-end encryption feature to only be available for paying customers, according to Zoom CEO Eric Yuan’s blog post on the acquisition. This makes it not just a security play but one that may be an incentive for the millions of people who are using the service for free to sign up for these paid services, boosting the company's bottom line. Additionally, the post noted Zoom would not build a mechanism to decrypt live meetings for lawful intercept purposes because end-to-end encryption has become the target of law enforcement ire over the years. It’s unclear what this will mean in the long term for the Keybase app, which featured the option of adding a Stellar cryptocurrency wallet for all users and was a popular security tool for the cryptocurrency community.",NEUTRAL,없음,REGULATION | SPONSORED | TRADING,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/05/07/zoom-seeks-to-deflect-privacy-security-concerns-with-keybase-buy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/82e1ea748e3ebdb9abd7a1cc0dafa4aef929b1b1-1292x838.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431890,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN7Hlh,1588870810,Securitize Builds Digital ID Service in Hopes of Creating Industry Standard,"Securitize is rolling out a common identification system for its customers that it hopes will streamline the know-your-customer (KYC) process for all participants in the security token ecosystem.      The company announced its new identification service, Securitize ID, Thursday, saying any individual who completes their KYC process with the transfer agent can use the same information when trying to onboard with any other company which adopts the service.      Securitize ID will be a standard that other companies working on security token issuances can adopt, said Carlos Domingo, Securitize's CEO and cofounder.      ""Within the ecosystem of the companies we work with for participating in a securities offering, there are issuers, there are transfer agents like us, there are custodians and ideally we can all agree on a common ID that is shared across all of these institutions that is compliant,"" he told CoinDesk in a Zoom call.      Essentially, a customer can sign up to Securitize, submit their KYC documentation, and be assigned an identifier. These customers or businesses will be monitored against regulatory watchlists, such as the U.S. Office of Foreign Asset Control Specially Designated Nationals sanctions list. If a customer wants to sign up to another company that accepts Securitize ID, they can use a single click to submit the same KYC documentation to that new company, rather than go through the process again.      Businesses      Securitize has been working on the new system for close to six months, Domingo said. Securitize's system also automates much of the process, rather than have an employee manually input details, which can take days, if not weeks.      This manual input, used by some traditional financial firms, is one of the reasons the KYC process can take an extended period of time Domingo said, pointing to a Refinitiv (formerly Thomson Reuters) survey which found financial institutions spend 26 days on average onboarding new clients.      ""We had the basic blocks because we were already doing ID for each individual issuer and the first step was to bring issuers onto the same platform,"" he said. ""That technology gave us a great advantage because it used to take a week or two [to conduct KYC] and now it takes like two seconds.""    Constantly updated    Securitize ID will be an actively managed service, Domingo said. If a customer's documents – for example, their passport – expire, the company will reach out to the individual to add an updated document.      This keeps the data fresh, Domingo said.      Even though the service uses a blockchain, if a customer wishes to move on, Securitize can delete their KYC information, Domingo added.      ""We only keep non-personally identifiable information [on the blockchain] because it's hard to delete things,"" he noted. The company itself will store the KYC information, using the same security protocols it already uses when storing customer information, but will assign each customer a number, which is what gets stored on a blockchain.      Securitize ID is part of the company's efforts to digitize securities      Transfer agents traditionally conducted a lot of their processes in-person, but this is likely to change amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, he said. Securitize did not need to stop or slow down operations when its employees went remote, but this may not have been the case for traditional transfer agents.      ""In many cases things are manual or paper based or face to face just because of legacy [reasons] but not because of regulation or law or anything, so once people take the step of moving to digital I don't see why they'll go back to not digital,"" he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/07/securitize-builds-digital-id-service-in-hopes-of-creating-industry-standard,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4672448899ed6db97707fdbcafe290d260f77ebe-1200x801.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431899,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN7I5h,1588870074,Schlesi Testnet Is Latest Step in Long Road Toward Eth 2.0,"Another Eth 2.0 testnet, Schlesi, is live in what amounts to one more step in the trek toward the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Eth 2.0, the next iteration of the Ethereum blockchain.      Named after a rail line stop in Berlin, Schlesi is a multi-client testnet laying the foundation for Eth 2.0’s backbone, the beacon chain. As of April 27, two teams – the Lighthouse client from developer Sigma Prime and Prysm from Prysmatic Labs – have synced and are actively validating the network, according to a tweet from testnet coordinator Afri Schoedon.      Nimbus, a mobile client version of Eth 2.0 for use in small hardware devices, and PegaSys’s Teku have also successfully synced with the network, according to a pair of recent tweets from the teams. Nimbus expects to officially join the testnet with the other clients in the coming days, according to a team blog post on May 1.      Schlesi is the first multi-client testnet for Eth 2.0’s beacon chain with the intention to show that “clients are ready to support a potential beacon-chain mainnet,” according to the Schlesi GitHub. The launch of the beacon chain is the first tangible application of Eth 2.0 under the title “Phase 0.”    Road to Eth 2.0    To overgeneralize, Lighthouse, Prysm and Nimbus are experimenting with the spinal cord of Eth 2.0, the beacon chain. Eight teams are currently working on Eth 2.0 clients with three teams currently participating in this testnet.      Read more: ‘95% Confidence’: Ethereum Developers Pencil In July 2020 for Eth 2.0 Launch      Originally, Ethereum was built with the intention of a future switch from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm to a PoS algorithm. These algorithms decide how transactions are processed over blockchains given that every movement is recorded by all the computers partaking in the network’s activities. PoS has been viewed as a possible alternative to PoW given the high costs of running a PoW blockchain for both environmental and financial reasons.      Moving a running network from one algorithm to the next is not a humble operation, however.      “The transition is risky, highly complex and will take a considerable amount of time,” a report published by BitMEX Research this week found.      From a developer’s perspective, the new chain will be created in two parts: groupings of ether (ETH) investors who deposit ETH into the network to act as transaction validators and the beacon chain, which coordinates the validators.      Those validators are further organized into 64 “shards,” akin to ribs connected to the Beacon chain spinal cord. These shards will settle accounts and balance on the new Ethereum network as coordinated by the beacon chain, the spine of Eth 2.0.    Testing, testing, 1, 2, 3    The recent testnets themselves show the redundancies necessary to make this transition possible, Schoedon told CoinDesk.      “There will not be ‘the multi-client testnet,’ rather there will be many testnets with different life expectations and different testing scopes,” Schoedon said.      Indeed, Schlesi was preceded by the Goerli testnet over a year ago and numerous individual testnets run by the various Schlesi clients.      Read more: A New Test Network Just Activated and Ethereum 2.0 Will Be Using It      As CoinDesk reported in January 2019, Prysmatic Labs experimented with moving ETH onto the community-run Goerli testnet by depositing tokens representing ETH into a smart contract to be redeemed on Eth 2.0.      Now that Schlesi is live, attention will eventually turn to private testnets for practicing validation across different clients followed by public multi-client testnets that ETH holders will be encouraged to stress-test by joining, Schoedon said.    Stretches before sprints    “Like all our testnets, this one was created to push the boundaries of technology and see how far we can go,” Nimbus research and development lead Jacek Seika said in an email to CoinDesk.      Seika said the Nimbus team had been running various testnets since March. Its Eth 2.0 lite client specification should be able to run on small devices such as a cellphone with the intention of democratizing access to participating in the network. The concept was a key reason Ethereum researchers gravitated toward staking as opposed to PoW mining.      “The goal is to lower the barrier of entry allowing a wider audience to participate,” Seika said.      Of course, the road ahead is still long.      An official multi-client testnet run by the Ethereum Foundation is expected before the launch of Eth 2.0’s Phase 0, planned for as early as July, according to Eth 2.0 researcher Justin Drake (Dates still vary, however: Schoedon said the launch could be as late as 2021.)      Read more: 8 Teams Are Sprinting to Build the Next Generation of Ethereum      Either way, it’s clear Eth 2.0 is making advancements. Sigma Prime co-founder Paul Hauner said the smaller testnets like Goerli or Schlesi would be considered successful if various clients could sync up together, as they did. For larger testnets, the bar will be higher.      “A coordinated, long-lived testnet I think will be successful once it’s been running for a couple of months, withstanding use from the public and co-ordinated attacks from security firms like Sigma Prime,” Hauner said.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/05/07/schlesi-testnet-is-latest-step-in-long-road-toward-eth-20,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c50ffd1af5196038da2b5735eb7686339d358026-1600x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Colloquially known as a “BitLicense,” having received one, the company is licensed to operate in the state.      Enter Europe TokenSoft is bringing its security token issuance platform to Europe through a Switzerland-based counterpart, TokenSoft International AG. The regulated STO platform announced Wednesday that it struck a licensing deal with its eponymous European partner, who now has exclusive continental distribution rights for TokenSoft’s tokenization software.      Noding Off Despite recent surges in price and mining power, Bitcoin’s total node count fell below 47,000 on Monday, a three-year low, according to developer Luke Dashjr. This trend is confirmed by Bitnodes’s data, which also a spike in nodes using onion services that may make node operators more difficult to locate. Peaking at over 200,000 in January 2018, node operators validate new transactions and store copies of the network's shared transaction history.      New Messaging There is a new messaging standard designed to help cryptocurrency firms comply with anti-money laundering regulations from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).

Market Intel    It's Bitcoin, Not You Bitcoin looks to have decoupled from traditional markets as investors refocus on the network's imminent mining reward halving. Bitcoin gained nearly 5.9% so far this month, while gold has declined by 1% and the S&P 500 is down 2.2%, on a month-to-date basis, as of Wednesday.      Halving Soon Bitcoin's halving is now predicted to come hours sooner. The cryptocurrency's price rally above $9,000 has caused some miners to switch to more efficient mining machines, thereby accelerating the speed at which new blocks of data are confirmed and pushing up the time of the anticipated halving event. Read the full First Mover newsletter here.      Volatile Estimates Bitcoin’s options market may be underpricing cryptocurrency’s future volatility. Analysts say the data is being distorted by “Black Thursday’s” 40% drop. The spread between bitcoin’s three-month implied volatility (IV), the market’s expectation of how risky or volatile an asset will be in the future, and historical or realized volatility (RV) fell to -47% on Wednesday.

In our CoinDesk Live: Lockdown Edition series, CoinDesk journalists and virtual audience members chat with speakers from Consensus: Distributed, our upcoming virtual conference on May 11-15.      For more episodes and free early access, subscribe with Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocketcasts, Google Podcasts, Castbox, Stitcher, RadioPublica, IHeartRadio or RSS.    This episode is sponsored by ErisX, The Stellar Development Foundation and Grayscale Digital Large Cap Investment Fundhttps://grayscale.co/coindesk.    Government regulators call the standards for regulating cryptocurrencies that were published in June of last year, nicknamed the Travel Rule, just recommendations.      But, really, they're not voluntary. They're rules every crypto exchange must follow or suffer the consequences.      Released by the Financial Action Task Force, a powerful intergovernmental organization that focuses on combating money laundering and terrorist financing, these standards were the topic of conversation on the latest episode of CoinDesk Live: Lockdown Edition.      During the conversation, CoinDesk's Aaron Stanley and Amy Davine Kim, the chief policy officer at The Chamber of Digital Commerce, had an exciting discussion on regulation (seems like an oxymoron). Kim outlined what the rules mean for crypto businesses and users alike as the deadline for compliance nears next month although Kim believes an extension might be issued because of the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic.      Other topics include:    What's a FATF? It's the Financial Action Task Force and you need to be aware of its recommendations.  What do those recommendations mean for crypto businesses? Hint: More compliance.  Why have these recommendations proven quite complicated for crypto businesses to comply with?  What's up with the recommendations being nicknamed the Travel Rule?  Is this one of those QWERTY keyboard situations where it's the first and so will be used extensively even though it may not be the best layout?  How regulators are struggling to govern these new crypto systems  Why regulators are fixated on counterparties  Any cost/benefit analysis to assess the burden of the recommendations?  China's reaction to FATF recommendations  How the COVID-19 crisis and subsequent lockdowns might affect FATF  Do U.S. exchanges have a leg up on complying with these rules?  Why the Libra ""cryptocurrency"" project, jump-started by Facebook, continues to get dragged  Countries that are going about complying with FATF the right way and those that are doing it wrong  Key FATF developments to watch  Solutions that are being built to help exchanges comply with the recommendations  It might not seem like it but relations have improved between regulators and crypto companies    Plus, there was some shameless, shameless plugging of our upcoming, completely virtual Consensus: Distributed conference, May 11-15, because the lineup is stacked!

42431905,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN7I7h,1588859369,How We're Raising the Virtual Bar at Consensus: Distributed,"Crypto finance is far bigger now than five years ago when the first Consensus conference took place, and so is Consensus.      Since 2015, Consensus has quickly gained attention as a ""must attend"" event, growing from 500 attendees and 12 sponsors to 4,700 attendees and 175 sponsors in 2019.      Despite immense challenges this year from social distancing restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic, we’re welcoming 10,000+ registered attendees from around the world to join us May 11-15 at this year’s completely virtual event, Consensus: Distributed.      CoinDesk’s editorial team continues to drive the narrative around the future of money, leading attendees through the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry's journey with leading economists, entrepreneurs, cypherpunks and visionaries.      As our attendees would expect, we’ve meticulously put together a high-caliber lineup with industry leaders including Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin, renowned economist Carlota Perez, Consensys CEO Joseph Lubin and Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, as well as pop culture icons Michelle Phan, Akon, Spencer Dinwiddie and The Chainsmokers, all of whom are actively trying to bridge the gap between their communities and crypto.      This year, we’re raising the bar. Going remote has allowed us to reimagine new ways of bringing together people from diverse industries and backgrounds. We’re experimenting with new ways of facilitating conversation, knowledge sharing and enjoyment.      Here’s a handful of the new experiences we’re offering at Consensus: Distributed:      24/7 programming for the masses    Crypto is a 24/7 industry -- and this year, so is Consensus. No longer bound by the geographic confinements of a physical space, our global team from New York to Chengdu is presenting CoinDesk TV — round-the-clock live programming for the first 24 hours of the event, blending the dynamic mainstage experience of our New York conference with the fast-paced energy of broadcast television.      We stream live on CoinDesk.com, YouTube and Twitter from Monday, May 11, at 8:30 a.m. ET to Tuesday, May 12, at 9 a.m. ET -- almost certainly coinciding with our coverage of the bitcoin halving. Can you pull an all-nighter?      That’s just the start. Far beyond the offerings of either a virtual seminar or no-touch TV show, our programming ensures diverse levels of engagement, from a keynote address by influential economist Carlota Perez to an AMA with ""Locked Up"" singer Akon to interactive workshops where you can get your hands on some cryptocurrency. To access the full programming, register for free access to our conference, hosted on Brella.      We’re also introducing programming tracks for broader skills and interests: Unlocked offers elementary and intermediate sessions for investors, developers and cypherpunks who want to dip their toes into blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. Also, there's Foundations, a forum allowing over 20 partners —including the Ethereum Foundation, Hyperledger, Stellar.org and the Lao Foundation — to connect with their communities.      See also: CoinDesk Live: How This ‘Legal Wrapper’ for DAOs Could Democratize Venture Capital      Plus, in a rare opportunity to convene some of the world’s most influential economic decision-makers, central bankers and other policy leaders, Consensus will play host to a workshop on the challenges, opportunities and future of central bank digital currencies with the National Bank of Cambodia’s Serey Chea, Mauritius Financial Services Commission’s Loretta Joseph and East Caribbean Central Bank’s Timothy Antoine. Moreover, Yves Mersch, a senior European Central Bank board member, will lay out the ECB's thinking on central bank digital currencies.    #NYBWGives    Not only did Consensus go virtual, but so did all of New York Blockchain Week 2020. In light of the public health and global economic crisis, we’ve banded together with some notable firms to launch a New York Blockchain Week COVID-19 Response fundraiser to provide relief to the communities that need it most.      Read more: The Man Who Forecast a Currency Cold War      CoinDesk has partnered with Gitcoin, The Giving Block and Ethereal Summit to raise money for a handful of nonprofits, several of which accept cryptocurrency payments. What's more, we’re employing the quadratic funding mechanism, conceived, in part, by economist Glen Weyl, which gives you a say in how the raised funds are allocated.      CoinDesk will match $25,000 of the funds raised.    It’s five o’clock somewhere    To drum up excitement for our fundraiser, we're hosting a virtual happy hour where we'll be loosening the ties and kicking off our heels to hear from a vibrant lineup of artists — not only their thoughts on the industry but also their creative talents.      Hear performances from Akon, Haley Smalls, Skip Marley and more. Musicians will perform live acoustic versions of some of their most popular songs as well as show us some hacks to make it look as if they are jamming live, even while we're apart.      Visual artist Mr. StarCity will be creating an interpretive painting, inspired by the music and the conversation, throughout the show. This painting will be put up for auction at the end of the show with all proceeds going to the #NYBWGives campaign.    Bitcoin halving countdown    As if planned, the next bitcoin halving — when the reward for miners verifying blocks is cut in half — is set to occur during Consensus: Distributed. We can't predict exactly when it will happen, but whenever it does we’ll be there, providing commentary and analysis with guests including Wang Chun, “Digiconomist” Alex de Vries and David Johnston.      Register: Bitcoin Halving 2020 Live Analysis Begins May 11 at Consensus: Distributed       Throughout the day, speakers will be discussing this pivotal moment in the economics of bitcoin supply, and our journalists and hosts will provide up-to-the-minute coverage of the event for you.    Virtual walk    Are you getting used to your new digital-first life after weeks in lockdown? We won't need you to break those rules, but we have a different kind of city for you to explore.      In Decentraland, take in the sights and sounds of this blockchain-enabled virtual world led by noted LAND lovers DCL Blogger and Barry Silbert, who's also the CEO of Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk’s parent company.      On May 11 at 1 p.m. EDT, the group leaves Centre Genesis Plaza (0,0) then ventures to check out some art, pop by Crypto Valley Convention Centre (64,15), visit a museum, and wrap up with chit-chat at Sugar Club.    It’s about the networking    The importance of event networking is not lost on us -- in fact, that is why we selected Brella, a networking-first event platform, to host our virtual conference experience.      When you register, you’ll be able to identify what topics interest you and find other participants with similar interests.

42431888,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN7Hhh,1588858361,"Sidestepping Telegram, Devs and Validators Launch Fork of TON Blockchain","Telegram's blockchain network finally launched today – or, at least, a version of it.      TON Labs, a startup that helped Telegram run the test network for the Telegram Open Network (TON), launched its own version of the blockchain Thursday, with the support of professional validators. Called Free TON, the fork comes after the group decided not to wait until Telegram is able clear the regulatory hurdles it faces before it can officially send TON live.      The initiative is supported by 13 validators and used code maintained by TON Labs. During a Zoom call livestreamed on YouTube, the genesis block of the new blockchain was generated, effectively marking its existence.      ""The network must not be censored, it must go to the world,"" TON Labs CTO Mitya Goroshevsky said on the call.      To distinguish itself from the original TON project, this forked version is named Free TON, and its tokens are called ""ton crystals,"" not ""grams,"" as Telegram’s were dubbed.      Telegram did not reply to a request for comment on the initiative by press time.      Telegram was not involved in the launch, according to Alexander Filatov, CEO of TON Labs. “It’s an independent launch of the open-source software,” he told CoinDesk. TON Labs is providing technical support for the code, while the team of (for now) 13 validators will be supporting the network. The code will be used under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.      Also read: With Kik and Telegram Cases, the SEC Tries to Kill the SAFT      The original TON had initially been scheduled to launch in October 2019, but was delayed after the SEC sued the messaging app company for allegedly selling unregistered securities. An injunction to halt the project was granted by a U.S. court in February, making the second launch deadline of April 30 unfeasible.    Devs in    However, as the code for TON is publicly available on GitHub, it’s technically possible to launch it without Telegram’s participation. “This project has its own community, its own idea, its own ideology. Not launching it would be a mistake,” said Konstantin Lomashuk, head of P2P, a Cayman Islands-based blockchain startup and a Free TON validator.      It’s not a mainnet, but it’s not a testnet either, said Sergey Vasilchuk, founder of the Kiev, Ukraine-based EverStake, also a validator. “We’re trying to launch the alpha version, see how this software works in real life,” Vasilchuk said. Like the Kusama network is for Polkadot, Free TON is serving as a proving ground for the tech before it can be launched in full, he explained.      “The way we see it is as a testnet that has the real distribution but might – and will possibly be – rolled back to the genesis state at any time if there are vulnerabilities in the code and black hats [malicious hackers] decide to exploit them on the live chain,” said Hendrik Hofstadt, CEO of the Berlin-based staking startup Certus One.      Currently, the 15 entities acting as validators include EverStake, P2P, Berlin, Germany-based Certus and other professional validation-as-service startups that are already supporting networks like Cosmos, Loom, EOS and Tezos.      There are also three cryptocurrency exchanges in the role, according to a list of validators shared with CoinDesk, including Kiev-based Kuna, London-based CEX and Hong Kong-based HitBTC. They won’t list ton tokens at this point, and will only act as validators, Filatov told CoinDesk.      Some of the validators came from the TON Community Foundation (TCF), also supported by TON Labs. The foundation launched its own testnet for TON earlier this spring. However, Filatov said “TCF didn’t become a truly international movement,” and thus didn’t succeed in leading the blockchain launch. However, its members can join the new network, too, he added.      ""There is absolutely no technical reason now for somebody to join this network (except the common reason for all altcoins – to get some coins),"" cryptographer Alexey Pryanishnikov, a TCF member, wrote in a chat while watching the launch livestream.      From launch, each validator will receive 380,000 ton crystal tokens to stake and start producing blocks for the proof-of-stake blockchain. There will be a limited supply of 5 billion tokens, as was the plan for the original TON blockchain. Out of those, 85% will be distributed to “Free TON partners and users,” 10% to developers and 5% to validators, a press release says.      “We expect the TON network to mature quickly and transition into a mainnet state over time,” Hofstadt said, adding that crypto exchanges will later list ton tokens, so that early participants will ultimately be rewarded.    Investors out    As a fork of TON, Free TON will have nothing to do with Telegram’s obligation to distribute tokens to investors in its $1.7 billion token sale, the participants say.      “It’s also very cool to launch a network with just validators and developers and having the vast majority of tokens controlled by a community pool, as opposed to investors. It’s a great experiment,” said Brian Crain, co-founder and CEO of staking firm Chorus One.      Hofstadt echoed the sentiment, saying: “We're very excited about TON because it is one of the first networks that is launching with a token distribution that is not centralized around early stage investors and VCs.”      Telegram's investors are unlikely to get their tokens. The firm sent them a letter last week, just before the launch deadline, saying the event has been pushed back to 2021. Five days later, Telegram fired off a new letter saying that the token distribution, awaited by the investors for over two years, is now not on the table.      Also read: What We Can Learn From Telegram’s Token Troubles      Those who funded TON can opt to either take 72% of their investments back now, or lend their funds to Telegram for a year to get a return of 110% in April 2021. U.S. investors, though, have only been offered the first option.      On Wednesday, the deal was further detailed. According to the Russian publication The Bell, Telegram sent over the terms of the loan, offering the 52.77% annual interest rate. It seems Telegram is reserving the option to repay investors at any time, meaning an investors would get 72% plus interest for the time the company utilized the loan, but with a minimum of three months.      Sergey Solonin, founder of the Russian e-payment firm QIWI and TON investor, told CoinDesk there's no point in lending money to Telegram on such terms.",NEUTRAL,TON,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | SPONSORED | TON | TOKEN SALE,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/05/07/sidestepping-telegram-devs-and-validators-launch-fork-of-ton-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8e8bac254a756eadcaaa62dc8446fe6184963191-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42387417,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXCD0gz,1588857756,Dread Pirate Roberts,"Dread Pirate Roberts (DPR) is the alias used by Ross Ulbricht, the creator of darknet market Silk Road. The pseudonym is a reference to the fictional character of the same name from the novel The Princess Bride, which was later turned into a film.      The Silk Road, best known for selling illegal drugs, operated as a Tor hidden service that would enable the users to browse it anonymously and securely from 2011 to 2013. Transactions on the site were carried out with bitcoin for privacy. Before it was shut down in 2013, the Silk Road handled over $1.2 billion worth of illegal goods and services, with over $79.2 million in commissions, according to the criminal complaint against Ulbricht. Following the closure of the site, the FBI seized 144,000 BTC (worth around $28.5 million at the time) which it said belonged to Ulbricht. The U.S. Marshals Service later sold off the bitcoin in four separate auctions.      The Dread Pirate Roberts (often abbreviated DPR) alias was created not by Ulbricht but by a still-unidentified Silk Road marijuana seed dealer who utilized the names Variety Jones and Cimon, and whom Ulbricht called a “mentor.” In 2016, Ulbricht’s lawyers said they had found evidence that someone had logged into the Dread Pirate Roberts account six weeks after Ulbricht’s arrest, when he was in federal custody. They posited that more than one person could have been using the account.      Internal Revenue Service (IRS) agent Gary Alford first linked Ulricht to the alias in June of 2013 through a post on the internet forum Bitcointalk from a user called ""altoid,"" who sought a bitcoin “IT pro” to be the lead developer for a “venture backed bitcoin startup company.” The post listed an email address with Ulbricht’s full name in it, and the name “altoid” was later used elsewhere to promote the Silk Road shortly after its launch. Ulbricht was arrested later that year.      In 2015, Ulbricht/DPR was convicted of four narcotics charges and three charges related to money laundering, computer hacking and trafficking fraudulent identity documents. Furthermore, the original criminal complaints alleged he paid to have two people murdered. The complaint accuses Ulbricht of hiring a Silk Road user to kill another user who threatened to expose the identities of thousands of the site’s customers. It also alleges he sought to have another person murdered whom he feared would give his information to the FBI.      Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole later in 2015, and is serving his sentence at the United States Penitentiary in Tucson, Arizona.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET,John Metais,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/dread-pirate-roberts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4efc802d8bd40a921640132bb221d258a03cd0c1-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Moreover, these acquisitions have only furthered Binance’s internal goal since Q4 2019: Bolstering its derivatives offering – catnip for seasoned crypto investors.      “It is still the company’s top priority in terms of the resource allocation,” Aaron Gong, Binance’s VP of futures, told CoinDesk in a recent interview.      Binance entered the derivative game by buying the JEX exchange in September. The futures market leads in volume after only seven months of operation and now sits in contention with perennial favorites like BitMEX for most open interest, a measurement of the aggregate open long and short positions on a market.      Gong said the Binance team expected to lead trading volume in as little as 12 to 16 months after launching. Market conditions, specifically March 12’s “Black Thursday” crash, would see the timetable moved forward considerably. BitMEX suffered a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack on that date – twice – forcing Arthur Hayes’ firm to briefly turn off its servers on what was the busiest trading day of the year.      Gong said BitMEX’s failure was Binance’s boon. The exchange shortly surpassed all others for most daily trade volume, according to data provider Skew.      “When we had huge market movements, we often heard issues from other exchanges in terms of system overloads,” Gong said. “But over the course of our entire first six months, we didn't have any issues.”      Binance’s ability to somersault into the derivatives market leaderboard doesn’t mean it has lost focus on retail users and its self-proclaimed desire to “exchange the world.” Rather, Binance is spreading its bets on various parts of the crypto economy and seeing what sticks.      If the CoinMarketCap deal was seen as Binance’s attempt to capture data-hungry newbies, other investments show the multifaceted spread of the firm’s tentacles. A joint effort with peer-to-peer exchange Paxful suggests fiat-stablecoin aspirations. A strategic investment in upstart FTX represented another bet on crypto derivatives.      Of course, only time will tell which bets will pay off and which won’t. Said Gong: “We want to bring long-term growth and improvement to the entire industry instead of just focusing on short-term goals.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/05/07/the-coindesk-50-binance-eyes-the-whole-pie,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e8482e8bcfbea046468de7e7218382bdde583f83-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42431876,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN7C7h,1588857331,The CoinDesk 50: Cosmos and the Dream of Anti-Maximalism,"In an industry known for tribalism and infighting, Cosmos is banking on everyone else’s success.      Launched in April 2019, the $590 million network is perhaps the most optimistic of protocols in development today, envisioning a future of tech-stack pluralities dialoguing with one another.    This post is part of the CoinDesk 50, an annual selection of the most innovative and consequential projects in the blockchain industry. See the full list here.    That’s how All in Bits, Inc. core developer Sunny Aggarwal described the project he’s helped shepherd for the past three years in between daily Twitter factoids for which he has gained niche notoriety.      “The premise for Cosmos is that we are the least-maximalist-possible project,” Aggarwal said. “We just want to connect everything together.”      Understanding the meta-blockchain Cosmos envisions is difficult and is mirrored by its odd business structure, which itself has recently endured self-inflicted wounds.      To recap, the blockchain network began in 2014 with the creation of All in Bits, Inc. (also known as Tendermint) by founder and CEO Jae Kwon. The company stewarded Kwon’s Tendermint Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm.      All in Bits was then contracted by the Interchain Foundation (ICF) to build out the Cosmos ecosystem via the Tendermint algorithm. Cosmos conducted an initial coin offering (ICO) in 2017, raising $17 million for its atom (ATOM) tokens.      In February 2020, following internal drama, All in Bits further split into two firms, creating Interchain GmbH (which now also does contract work for the ICF). As CoinDesk reported in February, All in Bits director Zaki Manian publicly criticized Kwon for pivoting to a side project built on Cosmos called Virgo. Manian later resigned his position, according to an All in Bits blog post.      Aggarwal said communication issues were mainly to blame for the infighting and have largely been resolved by the reorganization.      “A lot of people did leave All in Bits, but honestly, in my opinion, I think it’s for the better. Up until then, All in Bits was the primary development team within Cosmos. I think this makes it more resilient,” Aggarwal said.      Like before but under a new entity, Interchain GmbH is primarily focusing on the forthcoming Inter-Blockchain Protocol (IBC) and the Tendermint Core algorithm while All in Bits continues to build out its already launched software development kit (SDK), both of which make interoperability easier in different ways, Aggarwal said.      Those two firms are responsible for the creation of a blockchain that will be able to translate data from one chain to another – in any programming language and across consensus algorithms – through either its IBC protocol or Cosmos’ purpose built-chain, Cosmos Hub.      “Cosmos is this vision of the network of interoperating chains and Cosmos Hub is one specific chain,” Aggarwal said. “For Cosmos, as a whole, it’s unclear what the layout will be. Will there be a couple of chains that are all connected together, will it be many chains, will it be a hub-and-spoke architecture? Who knows.”      After its mainnet launch in just over one year ago, the network has dozens of projects building out testnets.      Yet, Cosmos isn’t alone in its universe. Summa and other projects have built bridges between Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest blockchains. Zcash developers recently began building a bridge with Ethereum.      And then there’s Polkadot, the largest competitor in the race to make blockchains talk to each other. Run by the Web3 Foundation and Parity Technologies, Polkadot provides interoperability options with its Substrate network, which has recently attracted projects like Shyft, Polymath and Nodle.      “Competitor” may be the best word to use but it’s not quite right, said Aggarwal. Rather, Cosmos and Polkadot just have similar visions and different methods of getting there, he said.      “There will always be different languages,” Aggarwal said. “There is not one programming language today and there’s not going to be one blockchain framework. As long as they can all interoperate, that’s what’s important.”",NEUTRAL,ATOM,ATOM | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | DOT | TOKEN SALE,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/05/07/the-coindesk-50-cosmos-and-the-dream-of-anti-maximalism,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3dddca08ef986f782e7c71ec3dced3380d6eb205-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431880,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN7CFh,1588852264,Bitcoin Outperforming Gold and Stocks so Far This Month,"Bitcoin looks to have decoupled from traditional markets as investors refocus on the network's imminent mining reward halving.      While the top cryptocurrency by market value has gained nearly 5.9% so far this month, gold, a haven asset, has declined by 1%. Meanwhile, as of Wednesday, the S&P 500, Wall Street’s equity index, was down 2.2% on a month-to-date basis, according to data source Skew.      Bitcoin is also the best performing asset of 2020 to date, with a 28% year-to-date gain. Oil (WTI) is down 66% – flashing red due to the massive destruction of demand brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.      The cryptocurrency has moved largely in tandem with the stock markets over the past two months. Prices fell from $10,000 to $3,867 in the first two weeks of March because the coronavirus-led sell-off in global equities triggered a global dash for cash. The cryptocurrency rose back above $7,000 in the following four weeks, tracking the recovery in stocks.      The positive correlation, however, weakened last week with bitcoin posting double-digit gains despite moderate losses in equities. The cryptocurrency is now trading near $9,300, representing a 4.4% gain on a week-to-date basis, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      The crypto market's focus seems to have shifted away from the coronavirus to the reward halving, expected to take effect on May 12 (though it may happen sooner). The supply-altering process has been hailed as a price-bullish event by many analysts for over a year now, and the recent rally from $7,600 to $9,400 may have been fueled by a fear of missing out (FOMO) on the expected gains.      Bitcoin’s network is also experiencing its busiest period in over two years. For instance, the seven-day average of the number of unique addresses active on the network jumped to 947,088 on Wednesday to hit the highest level since January 2018, according to the data from Glassnode. The spike suggests increased investor interest in the cryptocurrency, as noted earlier this week.      Further, the cryptocurrency’s hash rate – the computing power dedicated to mining blocks – recently rose to an all-time high of 140 exahashes per second.      Most observers expect bitcoin’s price to rise into five figures ahead of the halving. From a technical analysis standpoint, the case for a rally to $10,000 would strengthen following an acceptance above a major resistance level.    Daily chart    Bitcoin is currently trading just above the resistance of the trendline connecting the July 2019 and February 2020 highs (currently at $9,280). If prices hold above that level for a few more hours, stronger chart-driven buying will likely emerge, lifting prices toward $10,000.      However, bitcoin has failed a couple of times in the last six days to keep gains above the long-term trendline hurdle.    Put options in demand    While the cryptocurrency is gaining altitude, investors seem to be buying put options (bearish bets, in effect), possibly to hedge against a potential post-halving price drop. This is evident from the rise in the one-month put-call skew from -3% on May 1 to 9.1% on Wednesday.      The positive reading indicates that put options are more expensive than calls (bullish bets) as a result of drawing higher demand.      Similar sentiments are being echoed by the put-call open interest ratio, which rose to a three-month high of 0.75 on Wednesday, according to data provided Skew.

Last week, Michael Maloney, chief financial officer of Coinmint LLC, a Puerto Rico-based cryptocurrency mining company with operations in upstate New York, examined data from the Bitcoin blockchain and estimated the halving would take place around 1 a.m. New York time on Tuesday, May 12. But on Wednesday he looked again, and it now appears to be arriving on Monday around 7:45 p.m.      You're reading First Mover, CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      The earlier arrival of the once-every-four-years event, which has engendered an almost cult-like obsession among some cryptocurrency bulls, is the product of bitcoin's recent price surge above $9,000, at a time when some computer operators on the network have already been pushing to upgrade to faster, more efficient machines.      The combination has led to an acceleration in the speed at which new blocks of data are confirmed on the distributed network.      ""Bitcoin prices are up, so a ton of more people are putting on gear,"" says Dave Perrill, CEO of Compute North, a cryptocurrency mining firm based in the Minneapolis area. ""That's why you're seeing it get quicker.""      Bitcoin was launched in early 2009, in the wake of the last financial crisis, and next week's halving will be the network's third. Some investors say the event is a catalyst for higher prices, though in the past such rallies have played out over timeframes of months or even years, not instantaneously. Other analysts argue that the whole thing is overblown, and that it's really just hype and speculation around the halving that might drive prices higher.      Whatever the case, the halving is marching ever closer – and apparently coming faster than most computer operators on the network, known as ""miners,"" had penciled in.      The halving is an arcane and automatic process built into the cryptocurrency's 11-year-old design. When it happens, the number of bitcoin awarded to miners for helping to secure the distributed network gets cut in half. In next week's halving, the number of bitcoin awarded per data block will drop to 6.25 from 12.5. At current prices levels, that represents a loss of about $58,000 in revenue per data block.      While such milestones are supposed to arrive roughly every four years, the actual date and time can vary based on the level of activity taking place on the underlying blockchain network. Officially, halvings happen after every 210,000 data blocks confirmed on the blockchain network; each block is supposed to take about 10 minutes, on average.      But a recent surge in the computing power devoted to the distributed network – known as hashrate – has sped up the creation of new data blocks. That, in turn, has accelerated the march toward the halving, officially set to take place at block number 630,000. As of Wednesday around 6 p.m. in New York, the network was at block 629,263.      In anticipation of the halving, miners have been upgrading their computers - ""rigs"" in the industry jargon - to newer models produced by manufacturers like China's Bitmain and Canaan Inc.      It's widely expected that most of Bitmain's popular workhorse S9 models, considered state-of-the-art when they hit the market in 2016, will become obsolete after the halving. Since revenue will drop by half, miners will have to spend roughly twice as much on electricity just to get the same number of bitcoin.      In fact, according to Maloney, many of those older-generation mining rigs dropped off the network when prices plunged below $5,000 in March amid the coronavirus-induced sell-off.      But bitcoin has come roaring back, and it's now up a staggering 30% in 2020, remarkable for a fresh-faced digital asset that the billionaire investor Warren Buffett described in February as having ""no value."" Such returns are nearly three times the year-to-date gains for gold – a traditional inflation hedge that many investors have sought out as governments and central banks around the world announced trillions of dollars of coronavirus-related aid and monetary stimulus. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index of U.S. stocks is down 12%, while the shares of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway are down 24%.      The price rally has made it profitable for the older-generation cryptocurrency mining rigs to come back online, squeezing out another week or more of profitability before the reduction in mining rewards hits.      ""If the price action is positive, all the miners who can mine will be mining,"" Coinmint's Maloney said in a phone interview.      In the meantime, the anticipation and hype around the halving has continued to build within the cryptocurrency industry, especially with indications mounting that some institutional investors are considering bigger allocations to bitcoin; the implication is that demand for the digital tokens will continue to rise even as the pace of new supply gets cut in half.      ""In my view, I see the halving as the start of the new supply-and-demand equilibrium,"" Danny Scott, CEO of the six-year-old, U.K.-based bitcoin exchange CoinCorner, wrote Wednesday in an email. “The event itself can be compared to the likes of New Year’s Eve. There’s typically a big build up.""      Coin Metrics, a digital-asset data provider, wrote Tuesday in an emailed report that while miners may face a steep drop in profitability, ""for the majority of the crypto community, this is a fun, speculative exercise with relatively low stakes.""      Based on the recent trend, the fun looks to start sooner rather than later.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,294 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,408 | 24-Hr Low: $9,065      Trend: With mining reward halving just a few days away, bitcoin is eyeing notable gains above the resistance of the trendline falling from June 2019 and February 2020 highs.      At press time, the cryptocurrency is trading just above the trendline resistance (currently at $9,280), having found bids around $9,030 during the Asian trading hours.      The bulls have failed twice in the last week to keep gains above the 11-month trendline hurdle and another rejection looks likely if we consider the above-70 (overbought) reading on the 14-day relative strength index. In fact, the indicator is hovering at the highest level since June 2019.      However, other indicators are supportive of a continued rally. For instance, the positive reading on the Chaikin money flow shows buying pressure is stronger than selling pressure. The five- and 10-day averages are trending north, too, indicating strong bullish momentum.      The overbought reading on the RSI would become valid if and when the price chart shows signs of buyer exhaustion. Currently, the price chart looks constructive, with the lower wicks attached to the previous three daily candles indicating dip demand.      As a result, a convincing move above the long-term trendline hurdle looks likely. On the way higher, the cryptocurrency may encounter resistance at $9,485 (April 30 high), which, if breached, would shift the focus to $10,000.      The bias would turn bearish if the spot price drops below $8,528, the low of Monday's long-legged doji candle. Most observers are of the opinion that fear of missing out, or FOMO, buying ahead of the reward halving, supposedly a price-bullish event, will likely ensure that price pullbacks, if any, will be short-lived.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/07/first-mover-bitcoins-halving-is-coming-even-sooner-than-you-realize,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/099d1dad030d40c5ed8c4a37e6a8ce90c50f1fc4-1500x994.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to securities filings cited by the New York Times on Wednesday, Loeffler was given ""stock and other awards worth more than $9 million"" when she departed her role as CEO of ICE's bitcoin-focused company to join the U.S. Senate.      Loeffler led Bakkt, a bitcoin spot and derivatives exchange servicing institutional investors, from its launch in 2018 until around the time she was appointed to the Senate in December. Bakkt also developed a consumer-focused payments app integrated into Starbucks' mobile payment system .      Loefller's husband, Jeffrey Sprecher, is the founder and CEO of ICE.      Loeffler's departure from ICE incurred compensation totaling $9 million in the form of ""shares, stock options and other instruments,"" according to the report, which she had previously been granted but was set to lose if she left Bakkt.      See also: ICE Spent ‘Nearly $300M’ Helping Bakkt Acquire Loyalty Firm Bridge2      According to securities filings cited by the Times, Loeffler had millions in restricted stock and options that were not eligible for sale when she left the firm on Dec. 20. Typically, when an executive departs from a company he or she gives up stock compensation.      ICE, however, altered the terms of the award, allowing her to keep it all, including the largest portion of the deal – a stake in Bakkt, valued at around $7.8 million.      Loeffler received much criticism earlier this year after she reportedly sold between $1.3 million and $3.2 million in stock following a private Senate briefing on COVID-19.      The senator and Sprecher made a total of 29 transactions in the weeks after the Jan. 24 briefing, the Daily Beast reported. In March, a major crash hit stocks over fears of the coronavirus's effects on the global economy.      ICE pushed back in a statement at the time, saying Loeffler and Sprecher ""have made clear that those transactions were executed by their financial advisers without Mr. Sprecher's or Senator Loeffler's input or direction,"" adding that the trades complied with company policies.

42431868,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN7Bnh,1588842000,Stellar Enterprise Fund Invests $5M in Crypto App Abra Ahead of Blockchain Integration,"The Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) is pumping $5 million into Abra, a crypto financial services app, in its largest enterprise investment to date.      Announced Wednesday, the capital allocation precedes Abra's integration with the Stellar blockchain. The crypto wallet and investments app's growing list of financial services are set to shift onto Stellar in a partnership both entities say will bolster network development.      Since Abra's 2014 launch as a bitcoin remittances mobile app, the San Francisco-based firm has steadily added more coins, crypto services – and attracted more venture funding – as its team staked financial links around the world. It now allows fractional investments in exchange traded funds, added support for thousands of U.S. banks, and cash-to-crypto transactions in the Philippines, among other services.      See also: IBM Signs 6 Banks to Issue Stablecoins and Use Stellar’s XLM Cryptocurrency      Previous venture rounds garnered Abra in excess of $40 million. Now, after the $5 million investment from Stellar's non-profit SDF, Abra CEO Bill Barhydt said his 16-person team will leverage Stellar's ""ability to use traditional banking infrastructure"" as it builds yet more banking tools.      ""Our enterprise investment fund is about building long term success on the Stellar network,"" SDF chief Denelle Dixon told CoinDesk. She said the $5 million investment ""will bring value to the network with Abra’s market-established next generation financial technology platform plus its expanding portfolio of financial services.""      Those services are slightly more restricted in the U.S because of what Abra called “regulatory uncertainty.” But the global firm – Abra operates in 155 countries – is developing tools for foreign markets as well as the US. Dixon said she's ready to bring Stellar along for the ride.      ""They have exciting products in the pipeline that they’ll be announcing as they become available and we believe these products, and their target markets, will enable financial services for users around the world, regardless of currency or location,"" Dixon said.      See also: Payments Firm Wirex Launching 26 Stablecoins on the Stellar Blockchain      Developers are also in Stellar’s mind with the Abra integration and investment. SDF founder Jed McCabe said the partnership adds “a compelling tool” that will spur the creation of “new business models” in the Stellar community.

42431875,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN7C5h,1588838400,Crypto Firms Establish Messaging Standard to Deal With FATF Travel Rule,"A new messaging standard released today is designed to help cryptocurrency firms comply with anti-money laundering regulations from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).      The standard, called IVMS101, defines a uniform model for data that must be exchanged by virtual asset service providers (VASPs) alongside cryptocurrency transactions. The standard will identify the pseudonymous senders and receivers of crypto payments, with such information “traveling” with each transaction.      Getting industry players to agree upon an interoperable data standard is a significant step towards a more regulated crypto space. The standard messaging format now needs to be incorporated into the various solutions being built by VASPs to meet Travel Rule requirements.      Read more: All Global Crypto Exchanges Must Now Share Customer Data, FATF Rules      “I’m pleased to confirm that the working group approved the final text and that the IVMS101 data model standard now exists,” said Siân Jones, convener of the Joint Working Group for InterVASP Messaging Standards.      Unambiguous data allows VASPs to exchange messages in an automated fashion, reducing costs and minimizing risks, the IVMS white paper states. A universal common language, the paper continues, enables beneficiary VASPs to understand and process the required information submitted by originating VASPs.      The standard has now been commended to the Chamber of Digital Commerce (CDC), Global Digital Finance (GDF) and International Digital Asset Exchange Association (IDAXA), the three industry bodies that established the joint working group, to formally endorse it, Jones said.      “Since the FATF published the Virtual Asset guidelines in June 2019, the industry has been working hard to comply with the guidelines, but there are challenges,” IDAXA said in an emailed statement. “One of them was establishing a common standard so any Virtual Asset Service Provider can work with any compliance solution vendor with ease. Coming up with the Intervasp Messaging Standard 101 (IVMS101) as a common standard is definitely the first step in the right direction.”      Read more: Inside the Standards Race for Implementing FATF’s Travel Rule      “Our members have worked hard to create this standard and achieve consensus in advance of FATF timelines – a real achievement in such a complex area,” the Chamber of Digital Commerce told CoinDesk in an email.      The updated FATF guidance saw a myriad of proposed technical solutions for dealing with how Travel Rule data can be shared by firms. The InterVASP group’s standard already has the backing of most of the well-known solutions being touted, including CoolBitX’s Sygna Bridge, CipherTrace’s TRISA, Notabene and Securrency (with OpenVASP of Switzerland saying the standard will soon be added to its roadmap).      Despite the coronavirus lockdown, the InterVASP working group has stuck to its proposed deadline: The standard has been released in time for FATF’s one-year review of progress on Travel Rule solutions at its June 2020 plenary meeting.      “Frankly, Siân Jones deserves a medal for being able to steer this absolutely bang on time,” said Malcolm Wright, head of the AML Working Group at GDF. “It’s a testament to her professionalism to have been able to do that.”    Painkiller    Having a standard in place removes a big headache for VASPs. Without a simple way for messages to be consistently formatted, firms would have to reconfigure outbound and inbound messages on a continual basis to avoid error, a costly and time-consuming business, especially if handling large transaction volumes.      The sort of wrinkle that could gum up the works is something as seemingly innocuous as the way a date of birth can be interpreted, said Wright. “So, is 12.6.20 the 12th of June or the 6th of December? That's the simplest example, really.”      Read more: Crypto Exchanges Need Common Messaging to Comply With Travel Rule      Collaboration across the crypto space to get the standard finished in time has been complemented by a helpful and engaging dialogue with regulators, said Wright.      One of the issues where FATF has shown understanding is the “sunrise period,” Wright said. This is the shift from planning and design to execution (and, ultimately, enforcement by regulators in each country).      “We are coming at it from opposite ends towards the same goal, and we are not quite there yet. So can a VASP that’s licensed somewhere talk to a VASP that’s in an unlicensed jurisdiction?” said Wright. “That’s an interesting challenge. But we have got a really nice dialogue with FATF at the moment talking about the sunrise period.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/05/07/crypto-firms-establish-messaging-standard-to-deal-with-fatf-travel-rule,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/483b3644bbb749f510f991cc3557f519295de0f4-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431873,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN7C1h,1588831200,Cambridge University Releases New Tool for Tracking Global Bitcoin Mining Power,"A team affiliated with the University of Cambridge has released a new bitcoin data tool showing the countries with the highest concentration of mining activity.      The Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF), which is based at the Cambridge Judge Business School, said Wednesday the Bitcoin Mining Map would visualize countries' monthly share of global hashrate for the very first time, as well as provide more in-depth data for comparing Chinese provinces.      On a global scale, the map shows China making up 65% of total global hashrate, with the U.S. and Russia back on 7%. While China is still way out in front, its share of the hashrate has dropped roughly 10% since September.      The data comes three mining pools – BTC.com, Poolin, and ViaBTC – and took seven months to develop. Blandin said it represented roughly 37% of total global hashrate and might skew too far against North America and Europe. They are hoping to plug in data from more mining pools and entities to create a more comprehensive picture.      See also: Older Mining Machines Turn Profitable Again as Bitcoin Rises Ahead of Halving      ""This data may validate some market intuitions, drive greater transparency, and help participants in the conduct of their operations,"" said Apolline Blandin, CCAF's cryptocurrency and blockchain lead, to CoinDesk in an email. ""From a research perspective, whether academic or industry research, this data can help better calibrate and adjust the parameters of researchers’ models.""      Many miners use virtual private networks (VPNs) to mask IP addresses and can make locations harder to pin down. In the methodology page, CCAF said that they had noticed this was particularly prominent in Zhejiang province. ""To mitigate this effect, we have divided the hashrate of Zhejiang province proportionally among other Chinese provinces listed in the pool’s dataset,"" it reads.      CCAF's mining map also shows Xinjiang as the Chinese province with the highest concentration of hashrate, conflicting with crypto asset manager CoinShares, which has placed the southern province Sichuan at the top in most of its bi-annual reports.      See also: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Nears All-Time High in Final Adjustment Before Halving      That may be because CCAF's dataset began in September 2019, at the start of Sichuan's dry season, when hydroelectric plants were running at lower capacities and aren't producing as much power. Blandin said the map may at least confirm some Chinese miners may actually migrate from Sichuan to Xinjiang after the rainy season.      Now that the wet season has begun, the disparity between CCAF and CoinShares data could well close.      EDIT (May 13. 09:25 UTC): A previous version of this article stated that data came from APIs and the mining map took around a year to develop.
