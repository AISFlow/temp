42383889,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ywIH,1590704402,Twetch Gets Suspended From Twitter in Wake of Trump 'Fact-Check' Storm,"Twetch is off Twitter.      The Twitter account of social media platform Twetch – run on the Bitcoin SV (BSV) blockchain – was suspended Thursday without warning, according to Twetch co-founder Josh Petty. (As of press time, it was restored but stripped of its follower count.)      Twetch positions itself as an alternative to the platform from which it was de-platformed, actively marketing itself against the San Francisco firm run by bitcoin enthusiast Jack Dorsey. Petty said the application maintains censorship resistance by archiving conversations on the BSV blockchain.      In fact, Twetch posted a meme aimed at Dorsey for censoring conversations on the platform mere hours before its account was suspended.      In the meantime, Twetch has launched an alternative account and will appeal the decision. If Twetch wins its appeal, Petty said it could be hours to days before the account is back up and running due to cache issues with Twitter’s infrastructure.      The de-platforming comes after President Donald Trump issued an executive order Thursday regarding the use of federal oversight of social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook.      Trump’s order was spurred by a “fact-check” performed on his tweet concerning the use of mail-in ballots for elections.      Petty said Twitter may have suspended the firm’s account due to heightened pressure on social media accounts following Trump’s threat of “nationalizing” platforms.      It may have been a case of “getting caught in the algorithms,” Petty said.",NEGATIVE,BSV,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION | BSV,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/05/28/twetch-gets-suspended-from-twitter-in-wake-of-trump-fact-check-storm,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d5bb583e32c1e236817038b17a28a77acb0b2b0-1366x852.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383887,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ywEV,1590702143,How Contact Tracing Can Be Effective While Guarding Privacy,"Vipin Bharathan is chair of the Hyperledger Identity Working Group where he researches solutions for privacy in public settings.      As the COVID-19 virus has spread unchecked in the U.S., complete shutdowns are the adopted solution. Contact tracing and isolation along with the necessary corollary, testing, are needed for opening the economy safely and to prevent a second wave and another shutdown and consequent deepening of economic distress.      In classic public health practice, human contact tracers interview the newly infected, attempting to jog their memory and find all the epidemiologically significant encounters that might have passed on infections. The tracers contact exposed people and persuade them to self-isolate and get tested. The effort has to be local because most of the contacts happen locally. When the infection is in its infancy with hot spots, rapid contact tracing and isolation can be very effective, as proven in many countries. Rapid contact tracing needs technology support. Many countries have used intrusive contact tracing apps.      See also: Citizen App's New Contact Tracing Feature Raises Privacy Red Flags      Contact tracing works to isolate the infected and their epidemiologically significant contacts instead of the whole population. Contact tracing and isolation works by limiting the number of new cases created by a single infected individual. Done well, it can stop an infectious disease in its tracks.      The U.S., the European Union and the U.K. are unique because of the large numbers of active cases. Laws, customs and culture prevent overt subversion of privacy. COVID-19, with its long pre-symptomatic infective period and extreme virulence for a few, presents unique challenges. Tracing and isolation have to be rapid for it to be effective. A human-based interview process is inherently time consuming and error prone due to its reliance on memory and the possibility of missing anonymous contacts. Phone-based interviews and detective work could also fail in the U.S. due to our resistance to anonymous robocalls.      These realities are acknowledged by contact tracing experts. Public officials are still forging ahead, recruiting thousands. Public health experts are also resistant to exposure tracing apps, skeptical of their privacy guarantees.      A survey conducted in March says many people worry that once started, proximity notification will continue well past the coronavirus scare (38%). The next two big concerns are the vulnerability of mobile appliances (33%) and the evergreen “do not want to be worried” (26%). This trust deficit can result in a less than ideal adoption of 60%.      This article argues for privacy-preserving proximity notification apps based on bluetooth. Bluetooth is granular enough to be effective to measure proximity. Although there are many competing proposals, privacy design of proximity notification apps have converged. The current winner for government adoption seems to be the Google/Apple (Gapple) framework. I call this a framework because it requires an overlay from the local public health system to work. The framework will be released as a patch to the operating systems covering the majority of cell phones in the world. Users do not need to explicitly download the framework.      To preserve the privacy of users and to be useful at the same time is a challenge. Privacy is enhanced by decentralization, by key schedule design and minimal collection of data. The proposed design of the Gapple framework shows how the app preserves privacy and is useful.    Installing the app    Users are in control and need to opt-in through downloading their local public health authority app. Data never leaves the user’s phone if they are never diagnosed positive.    Before infection    A daily random key is generated on the user’s phone. The daily random key deterministically generates many proximity keys that are broadcast using Bluetooth. Deterministically means that if a daily random key is known then all proximity keys can be regenerated. These proximity keys are captured on each user’s phones that run the same app when proximity parameters are met. These proximity keys are equivalent to random noise; meaning the phones that broadcast them can not be identified by correlation. Proximity parameters are determined by local health authorities, usually more than 15 minutes continuously at less than six feet. At this point, all data resides on the user’s phones and never leaves them.    On a positive diagnosis    If any user is diagnosed and found to be positive, the user can opt to upload his or her list of daily random keys to the local public health server for their pre-symptomatic but infective days before the diagnosis. A testing code is needed for this to prevent malicious uploads. The daily random keys from infected users are fanned out to all the users in the local area. The app on the target phones then re-runs the same deterministic algorithm and looks for matches with the previously stored proximity keys. If there is a match, the app warns the owner of the phone to seek testing and to call the local health authorities. If the person tests positive, the process of notification starts over again.      See also: European Contact Tracing Consortium Faces Wave of Defections Over Centralization Concerns      The public health servers only distribute the data and never knowing anything about the users. Gapple can never find anything more about the users. The app will be turned off when the virus subsides.      It is natural for the public and the public health officials to be suspicious of proximity notification functions implemented by companies like Google and Apple, which are in the business of harvesting private user data and monetizing it. Apple and Google have to agree to have an independent audit or open source their implementation for review to allay this fear.    Adoption    Widespread adoption of a proximity notification app is not just a technical challenge. Public health authorities have to welcome it as a useful addition to their contact tracing arsenal. This may not happen in the first opening; but if subsequent waves of infection hit, and classic contact tracing by itself proved unworkable for the coronavirus, more of the common people and authorities may be open to alternatives.      Here are some suggestions for improving adoption of proximity notification apps to aid classic contact tracing. Public support by trusted influencers are vital to widespread adoption. These influencers need to be from a spectrum of trustworthy sources: scientists, health authorities, privacy advocates.      Incentives are important for adoption. Once proof of proximity can be given through a QR code, faster testing must be made available for the exposed. In addition, if proximity is proven and you have to quarantine, financial or housing support could be provided for loss of income as well as quarantine hotels, food, laundry and mental health support. The installed app should trigger disability and employment laws to force continued employment.      Adoption may not happen after the first wave, but may happen if a second wave shuts down the local economy and communities become more receptive to such an app.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Vipin Bharathan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/05/28/how-contact-tracing-can-be-effective-while-guarding-privacy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e0fc97bed713d63dfac874830283679187d9ee85-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383897,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ywOZ,1590700289,"Market Wrap: Short Seller Liquidations Help Push Bitcoin Beyond $9,500","Bitcoin broke through $9,500 Thursday and those short sellers betting on lower prices got liquidated by some crypto derivatives exchanges. That also helped push the world’s oldest cryptocurrency higher.      As of 20:50 UTC (4:50 p.m. ET), bitcoin (BTC) was trading at $9,447, up 2.9% over the previous 24 hours. Trading seems to support a higher upward climb with a large session of buying around 12:00 UTC (8 a.m. ET) briefly pushing price to as high as $9,526 on exchanges including Coinbase. Bitcoin’s price continued its rising trend from Wednesday, well above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a technical analysis signal of bullish sentiment.      “A breakout above $10,055 would be a catalyst for significant upside in our work, and support is now defined by the 200-day moving average, which is now at $8,377,” said Katie Stockton, an analyst that covers global markets at Fairfield Strategies.      Stockton doesn’t see the buying momentum for bitcoin slowing down anytime soon. “We think intermediate-term trend-following indicators are pointing higher,” she told CoinDesk.      Large price movements in the bitcoin spot market can often be attributed to the crypto derivatives markets. The derivatives exchange BitMEX, for example, automatically liquidates both long and short seller positions when price begins to quickly move. Bitcoin’s upward trend is being helped in this instance by short sellers getting squeezed out, which triggers automatic buy orders that help move prices higher.      Read More: Bitcoin Price Tests $9.4K as Demand for Put Options Drops      “There are definitely topside liquidations on BitMEX, and more than on average,” said Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivatives exchange startup Alpha5. Over the past 24 hours, buy liquidations are at $39 million on BitMEX, and have far outpaced the $4 million in sell liquidations.      Since May 25, sell liquidations (shown in red in the above chart) have started to abate as buy liquidations grow (shown in blue).      The influence of BitMEX on the markets has been controversial as the exchange’s $700 million in liquidations during March’s precipitous price drop was considered a huge factor in downward selling pressure at the time.      Read More: Genesis Hires Ex-Galaxy Digital Staffer to Run New Derivatives Trading Desk      However, Shah says BitMEX’s influence, while still important, is not what it was prior to March. After hitting a high of $1.1 billion in open interest in February, it has not recovered since the March 12 crash and now stands around $630 million. “I do think BitMEX is turning more into a fractal of the market than the anchor. Open interest is definitely in osmosis.”      Along with short squeezes, it’s obvious more people looking to buy bitcoin are helping the price appreciation, according to Rupert Douglas, head of institutional sales for cryptocurrency asset manager Koine. Douglas senses spot exchanges could continue to be heavy on buy orders for bitcoin. “I think the big rally is about to start. I don't think we are going to trade below $9,000 again,” he said.      However, not everyone is bullish as some traders are planning for downside price action in bitcoin to return at some point. A consistent price increase simply isn’t the dynamics of a market, and crypto is no different, said Josh Rager, a bitcoin trader and founder of educational platform Blackroots.      “What we're seeing with bitcoin is a two-month run-up with a potential pullback right now, reversion to the mean and price heading back down to $7,000 to $8,000 wouldn't be out of the question,” Rager said. “In fact, it would be healthy after running up in a two month period.”    Other markets    Digital assets on CoinDesk’s big board are all in the green Thursday. Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, gained 3.8% in 24 hours as of 20:50 UTC (4:50 p.m. ET).

42383875,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yw3B,1590695081,BitClave Search Engine Agrees to Pay Back $25M ICO in Settlement With SEC,"BitClave, a California startup whose Ethereum-based search engine raised $25.5 million in a 2017 token sale, will pay back its 9,500 investors in a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).      The settlement ended BitClave’s court saga almost as soon as it began. Prosecutors with the SEC announced their charges Thursday in tandem with an order that called BitClave’s Consumer Activity Token (CAT) sale an unregistered initial coin offering (ICO).      BitClave neither admitted nor denied that it broke the law when it sold CAT in 2017. In exchange, the “blockchain services firm” will return all $25.5 million to the investors and pay nearly $4 million in additional fines and fees.      CoinDesk reported in 2017 that CAT sales were meant to boost awareness of BitClave’s data-centric search engine alternative, the BitClave Active Search Ecosystem (BASE). At the time, founder Alex Bessonov described BASE as a transparent pairing of retailers and search engines. CAT was the carrot incentivizing BASE usage, Bessonov said.      The SEC, however, called CAT something else: an investment contract.      Read more: US Court Freezes Assets Linked to Alleged $9M ICO Scam      Thursday’s SEC order said CAT tokens were investment contacts because investors had a reasonable expectation CAT would appreciate in value as BitClave matured. The order quotes BitClave’s white paper:      “As more service providers join, the amount of CATs required for an equivalent service will gradually decrease, corresponding to a CAT value increase.”      As per the settlement, BitClave will transfer 1.32 billion uncirculated CAT for “permanent disabling” and request that exchanges delist it. CoinMarketCap showed YoBit.net as the only exchange carrying CAT at press time Thursday. The data site lists CAT’s market cap at $76,753.      “Issuers of securities, traditional or digital, must comply with the registration requirements of the federal securities laws,” Kristina Littman, the SEC’s cyber enforcement chief, said in a statement. “The remedies ordered by the SEC will provide meaningful relief to investors in this unregistered offering.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/05/28/bitclave-search-engine-agrees-to-pay-back-25m-ico-in-settlement-with-sec,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/01e4f8b8a9613ff360c98032e1dae3140eeb8c80-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The initiative was named Vzaimipomosch, which in Russian means “The Mutual Help.”      “Pavel reached out to us himself and offered help,” Zhukov told CoinDesk. He added that a part of the donation has already been spent. The donation is a large one for Russia: To put it in perspective, this amount of money can buy an apartment in Moscow.

Vitalii Antonenko, 28, was charged in the U.S District Court for the District of Massachusetts on Tuesday with conspiracy to engage in computer hacking, payment card trafficking and money laundering, according to a federal indictment.      Law enforcement found hundreds of thousands of stolen payment cards on Vitalii Antonenko’s computers after arresting the Ukraine native at Kennedy International Airport in March 2019. They charged Antonenko with money laundering at the time.      In the Tuesday indictment, prosecutors outlined a multi-pronged money-laundering scheme that turned proceeds of stolen and sold credit card data – including data from an unnamed Massachusetts hospitality business – for tens of thousands of dollars.      Working with two conspirators from 2014 to 2016, Antonenko allegedly received at least 114 bitcoin from one, sent about as much bitcoin to the other, and then received nearly $40,000 in cash bank deposits 10% below market rate, the indictment said.      Law enforcement officials say an undercover agent bought a victim’s stolen card data from the first conspirator in November 2016. It further alleged the conspirator sent Antonenko 4.38 bitcoin the same day they discussed hospitality card data Antonenko still had for sale.

Despite the havoc coronavirus wreaked on markets, the fund did better in those four months than the stock index did in any full year since 1997. And as a result of the climb, the fund returned 73% for those who invested from day one and held on through to last month. MaiCapital has launched the “Bitcoin+ Investment Fund,” an actively managed, quant-driven hedge fund to track bitcoin’s performance.

42383865,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ysPz,1590686293,What Goldman Gets Wrong About Bitcoin (From Someone Who Used to Work There),"When I worked at Goldman Sachs, one of the running jokes among those around me was that I spent more time trading bitcoin than the bonds I was meant to be covering. Back in 2013, bitcoin was not taken very seriously among my colleagues. Even seven years later, I did not expect much to have changed. So, as I started reading and listening to the Goldman Sachs research piece on bitcoin Wednesday, I was pretty sure I knew where it was going.      The report begins with an overview of the state of the U.S. economy and projections as to what it may look like in a post-COVID-19 world. In particular, the report emphasizes that inflation is unlikely to be something to worry about anytime soon. Dollar demand remains strong and indicators show the pandemic has had effects that are, if anything, deflationary in nature. As I’ve written before, I think this is largely true for the short-to-medium term.    Jill Carlson, a CoinDesk columnist, is co-founder of the Open Money Initiative, a non-profit research organization working to guarantee the right to a free and open financial system. She is also an investor in early-stage startups with Slow Ventures.    Goldman’s research then goes on to make a largely data-driven argument against investing in gold. Not only do we not have to worry about inflation, it says, but even if we did, gold would not be a great investment. Gold has not consistently outperformed inflation whereas equities have. Similarly, U.S. Treasury bonds tend to offer a much better return in market downturns than gold. It turns out that gold does not always, or even often, behave as advertised. There are better options. The value of gold as an asset class has largely been driven by historical narrative – and that narrative does not line up with reality.      This is all reasonable. And as I say, I thought at this point that I knew where this was going. I believed the talented team of Goldman research analysts was about to break down bitcoin in a similar way. The story that has been told around bitcoin as an inflation hedge does not line up to the reality of how bitcoin has performed over the course of its albeit brief life as an investable asset. The noisiness and volatility of its price action has prevented us from being able to draw a meaningful correlation between bitcoin and any major market or economic indicators. I expected Goldman’s report to conclude by summarizing that inflation is not an issue and that even if it was, neither gold nor bitcoin behave as the narratives around them might lead us to believe.      See also: Jill Carlson - Finance and the Real Economy Can’t Stay Out of Sync Forever      I was wrong. Rather than make a parallel argument to the one that they made against gold – a feat that is eminently possible using the data at hand and would have made for a compelling case – Goldman research launched into a series of non sequiturs about the objectionable traits of and dynamics around bitcoin. They did exactly what I find the smartest people often do when confronted with something as ground-breaking as bitcoin: they abandon all reason.    They did exactly what I find the smartest people often do when confronted with something as ground-breaking as bitcoin: they abandon all reason.    The report first poses the question as to whether bitcoin is a currency or an asset class. After only defining the features of a sovereign currency, the report concludes that, due to bitcoin’s failure to meet these criteria, it does not qualify as an asset class. This makes so little sense there is not even a name for this kind of logical fallacy.      “We believe that a security whose appreciation is primarily dependent on whether someone else is willing to pay a higher price for it is not a suitable investment for our clients,” the report goes on to state.      I hate to point out that, really, the fact someone else is willing to pay a higher price for a given instrument is probably the only criteria necessary to know something is a suitable investment. The reasons why someone else will be willing to pay that higher price are what is interesting and are what people generally look to the likes of Goldman Sachs research to explain and expound upon.      It’s not worth detailing every misconception or failed bit of logic in the report. But a few are worth mentioning. Goldman's argument that cryptocurrencies are not a scarce resource due to the ability to fork into “nearly identical clones” represents a shocking failure of research into the immense technical and cultural differentiations between the three examples that they offer (bitcoin, bitcoin cash and bitcoin sv).      Goldman raises the possibility that cryptocurrency can be used for illicit activity to further discredit it – failing to address that the U.S. dollar, which is lauded for its strength earlier in the report, is the number one asset in the world used for illicit activity.      See also: Jill Carlson - How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Money Printer      Finally, the report says the infrastructure around bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is relatively immature. There is much that is misrepresented on the slide illustrating this contention, including the omission of the option to self-custody assets uniquely offered by cryptocurrency. For a company that prides itself on being a “technology firm,” this slide in particular demonstrates an unwillingness to break out of traditional ways of thinking and instead look toward the possibilities opened up by bitcoin.      It would be easy to blame Goldman’s poor arguments against bitcoin on intellectual laziness or a certain strain of stuck-in-the-past thinking. If there is one thing I know from having worked there, however, it is that Goldman Sachs is neither lazy nor slow on the uptake. Rather, I would posit, the weakness of Goldman’s thesis around bitcoin is due primarily to the weakness of the industry around bitcoin in articulating the defining attributes and uses of this paradigm-shifting technology. There are exceptions, to be sure. There are voices, for which I am immensely grateful, that ring out loud and clear in articulating why bitcoin is valuable. But they have an arduous task breaking through the din of misinformation and jargon.      One need only look as far as the industry’s recent failed attempts to sell J.K. Rowling on the value proposition of bitcoin to know that we need to start finding better ways of communicating. If we want the likes of Goldman Sachs to buy into bitcoin, or if we even just want it to be able to make coherent arguments as to why not to buy into bitcoin, then we as an industry ought to look at the coherence of our own arguments first, do more to quiet the noise and work harder to lift up the voices that do make an honest and compelling case.",NEUTRAL,없음,BCH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Jill Carlson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/05/28/what-goldman-gets-wrong-about-bitcoin-from-someone-who-used-to-work-there,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/62cf5b82c3d21993f86e1720843d35dcbce089b7-1702x1880.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42383868,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ysV1,1590685375,Enigma Blockchain Has a New Name and a Privacy Boost in the Works,"The Enigma mainnet was rebranded the Secret Network after an on-chain proposal by the community unanimously passed on May 17. The new website, Twitter and blog, among other digital assets, went live Wednesday.      The Secret Network, so named to describe its decentralized governance, is an open source network that protects data for users of decentralized applications, now known as “Secret Apps.”      With 28 active validators, the vote was, in part, a move to bring the different core contributors under a single, identifiable umbrella, even though they remain separate entities, in part as a way to attract developers and users. With the rebrand now complete, an acute push for developers is one of the next steps. Key contributors to the development of the mainnet and governance include Enigma, Secretnodes.org and Chain Of Secrets, among others.      “Enigma is thrilled that the branding for the mainnet blockchain now better reflects the communal effort supporting the chain, its growth and its mission — to bring privacy to public blockchains,” said Tor Bair, Head of Growth at Enigma, in a text message.      The Secret Network’s protocol lets decentralized applications utilize encrypted data without revealing it on a public blockchain, or even to nodes themselves, using smart contracts that can utilize private data termed “secret contracts.” The secret contract testnet is a few weeks away from launching but if all goes well it will then be proposed to the mainnet.      See also: Enigma Launches Second Testnet for ‘Secret Contract’ Blockchain      As CoinDesk has reported previously, the aim is “to create a secure, off-chain environment able to process sensitive and private blockchain data with end-to-end encryption.” If the testnet is incorporated into the mainnet by a vote, it will be the first layer one blockchain with privacy-preserving smart contracts, according to Bair.      The mainnet is based on the Cosmos software development kit, a network of parallel independent blockchains, and using the consensus algorithm Tendermint. It was secured by a “Secret” coin when it originally launched in February. This move is an extension to expand that name to the whole network, and reflect its community driven progress.      “The branding of ‘Secret Network’ follows the name of its native coin (Secret, SCRT) as well as existing concepts in the ecosystem such as secret nodes, secret contracts, and Secret Apps. Secret Network now has its own community-maintained website,” according to a new blog post on the site.      This comes a few months after an Enigma MPC settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over charges relating to the blockchain startup’s $45 million token sale in 2017.      From now on, validators on the Secret Network will be known as “Secret Nodes,” and data being processed will be kept encrypted from the node itself. The network is also planning to conduct an incentivized testnet where validators can help develop this new function.      “Enigma and the Secret Network community are now looking forward to the upcoming launch of our incentivized testnet and the Secret Games, where we’ll continue to test secret contract functionality for the network,” said Bair.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/05/28/enigma-blockchain-has-a-new-name-and-a-privacy-boost-in-the-works,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6b13ef579fdadd1cacff76c10f8c9efe2fee25c0-2560x1638.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383867,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ysSV,1590684144,Stellar Throws SatoshiPay a $550K Lifeline After Coronavirus Knocks Out Series A,"The Stellar Development Fund (SDF) has loaned micropayments firm SatoshiPay $550,000 in XLM tokens after the coronavirus pandemic put the kibosh on its Series A funding round.      Under lockdown in his Berlin flat, SatoshiPay CEO Meinhard Benn told CoinDesk via Google hangout the Series A, which was to have been finalized by the start of Q2, ""fell apart"" at the last minute because of the coronavirus pandemic as it became impossible to arrange meetings with potential investors, and market turbulence led to previously committed investors to pull out.      Through its Enterprise Fund, SDF had already pledged $550,000 to the Series A. After it became clear the round wouldn't happen, the Foundation agreed to convert their investment into a loan to provide the company with cash flow for the next 12 months. The value of the loan was transferred in lumens at a fixed exchange rate, which SatoshiPay can choose to convert out again into fiat currency when required.      ""It was very kind of them, you know. They see this situation happening [and] they sit on $550 million and they thought, okay, we might as well help these guys, just to kind of safely get them through all of this, and then have a proper raise afterwards,” Benn said.      Overall, SatoshiPay has reduced costs by almost 60%, which gives it a year-long runway – enough, Benn believes, to see the back of the coronavirus. He rubs his shaven head – a ""necessity"" as restrictions mean barbers will remain shut for months.      Like many other German companies, SatoshiPay is reliant on Kurzarbeit – a scheme where the German state pays a share of employee salaries to keep them on the payroll. SatoshiPay's staff is currently working half-days, with the government paying 50% of the wages, Benn said.      Luckily, Benn added, SatoshiPay had been in a comfortable cash position prior to the pandemic. The SDF loan will allow the company to continue, in a slim-downed format, to operate until such time as it can begin a Series A in 2021. Once the funding round is over, SDF's loan will be converted into an equity stake.      But is SDF interested in perhaps a larger stake? ""That's not been talked about at all,"" Benn said. ""If the raise stays as planned, then they will not.""      See also: Fed Up With Its Fork of Stellar, Kin Is Looking to Move Onto Solana      The relationship between SatoshiPay and SDF was already close. SatoshiPay runs Stellar nodes and launched Solar, an open-sourced wallet on the protocol. ""We're a close ally,"" Benn said. ""We have, like, two or three calls with the Foundation every week on technical matters and strategic matters.""      Benn wouldn't say exactly how much his company expects to raise through the Series A, only that it was ""north of a couple of million.""      How much would the SDF equity stake be worth? Benn wouldn't go into details – ""this would give away an equity valuation"" – but to give perspective, it would be less than the 27.7% stake held by SatoshiPay's biggest investor, the London-listed Blue Star Capital, which invested $700,00 in early 2017.      See also: Stellar Invests in Security Token Platform Targeting Developing Markets      Delaying the Series A because of the coronavirus wasn't great, but Benn sees a possible silver lining. Lockdown gives the company more time to work on product development. By the time the Series A does take place, SatoshiPay will have a new B2B solution for cross-border money transfers and micropayments in public beta, Benn said.      Does the loan give SDF too much control over SatoshiPay? Benn doesn't think so: ""They want to maintain us as independent as much as possible while still supporting us,"" he said. ""They need independent players, independent companies that have a real-world need for what they're doing and not just because they are paid off partly by SDF.""      ""I think we've managed to maintain that balance quite perfectly,"" he added.      Correction (May. 28, 16:50 UTC): A previous version of this article misstated the loan amount.

Speaking during an annual shareholder meeting Wednesday, Zuckerberg said Facebook's commerce work, including Libra, should be viewed through the lens of its ads business, according to a transcript posted by Thomson Reuters. The company treats its ads business as an auction, meaning entities can bid for their best price.      ""Because we don't have to set a price, every business can just bid for themselves what an ad is worth to them in terms of what results they're trying to get, which means that we can always offer any business the lowest possible price, which is great because that way, it's very inclusive,"" Zuckerberg said. ""Millions of businesses around the world can participate, and the business can be very efficient.""      Combining ads with an effective payment tool for users can benefit businesses further, he said, citing both Facebook Pay and Libra.      ""If we can make commerce be more effective for businesses if when they run an ad, somebody who clicks on that ad is now going to be more likely to buy something because they actually have a form of payment that works that's on file,"" Zuckerberg said. ""Then it basically becomes worth it more for the businesses to bid higher in the ads than what we see are higher prices for the ads overall.""      See Also: Libra’s Long Road From a Facebook Lab to the Global Stage: A Timeline      He also reiterated past talking points about Libra, saying the infrastructure around payments ""hasn't been updated in a very long time.""      A tool like Libra, which currently envisions a number of different stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies, could make it easier for individuals to transfer funds or pay for goods across national borders, which would further benefit businesses and Facebook.

42383888,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ysRF,1590681601,Compound’s Approach to DeFi Governance Starts With Giving Away COMP Tokens,"Users of the Compound lending platform will begin earning COMP tokens in mid-June, pending the public review of the decentralized finance (DeFi) firm's distribution plan.      COMP, the governance token for the Ethereum-based lending dapp, was first announced in February. According to a draft blog post shared in advance with CoinDesk, roughly 42% of the total supply of COMP tokens will move into a reservoir pool and begin daily distributions to users of the protocol for the next four years.      ""Today, we're excited to announce that Governance is ready to scale from our core team and shareholders, to the entire Compound ecosystem,"" Compound's founder, Robert Leshner, wrote in the blog post.      Read more: Compound Extends DeFi Ethos to Itself, Launches Governance Token      As previously reported, anyone can propose a change to the Compound protocol. Changes might include adding new assets, changing the model for setting a given asset's interest rate or sunsetting an asset. All of these actions were recently tried out in a closed test of the governance platform, according to the blog post.      A proposed governance change will only go to a vote if 1 percent of the total supply of COMP tokens signals that it should do so. From there, the full process from voting to code change takes several days.      COMP token allocations were described when the plan to decentralize was first announced: 46% will be held by shareholders, founders and the Compound team, but about half of that is subject to a four-year vesting period. This means a large portion of the voting power is controlled by the people who created Compound, even if the company that did so won't hold any COMP.      ""Delegation is core to this decentralization,"" Leshner told CoinDesk. ""COMP token holders (most of which are not in the business of writing protocol upgrades) already delegate to the community; adding tens of thousands of new token holders will multiply participation.""    How distribution works      Revealed today, new COMP will be awarded every day to users of the protocol, based on usage. There will be rewards to borrowers and lenders in each asset and new COMP will be distributed at every block. Approximately 2,880 COMP per day will be released to users of the protocol.      Half the distribution each day goes to suppliers of assets and half to borrowers. Assets that are seeing the most activity will also receive the most COMP tokens each day, so allocation will move with the market.      Read more: DeFi Startup Compound Finance Raises $25 Million Series A Led by A16z      Right now, COMP purely runs Compound. No returns accrue to the token in its present design, but that is something COMP holders could address themselves later.      ""The governance right gives the community complete control to evolve the economics of the protocol and COMP in entirely new ways – so I have no idea what COMP looks like in two years,"" Leshner wrote.      As of press time, some $98.5 million worth of crypto assets are locked into the Compound protocol, with yields ranging from 0.7% for supplying BAT to 2.70% for tether (USDT).",POSITIVE,BAT | COMP,BAT | BLOCKCHAIN | COMP | FORKS | ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/05/28/compounds-approach-to-defi-governance-starts-with-giving-away-comp-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a9aaecfa01980997842f1926093078b4956a4304-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a filing earlier this month, the U.S. District Court sitting in Austin, Texas, froze the assets of the individuals and entities believed to have received funds from the Meta 1 Coin initial coin offering (ICO).      The court agreed with the SEC that the ""Warner relief defendants"" — Wanda Ironheart Traversie-Warner (“Traversie”), Alfred Dewitt Warner Jr. (“Warner”) and Ironheart Trust (“Ironheart”) — would try to ""dissipate, conceal or transfer assets,"" including by sending them offshore, unless the assets were frozen.      The ruling, dated May 14, encompasses all the fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies linked to the Meta 1 Coin sale. The Warner relief defendants were also tasked with providing the SEC with a list of all assets valued at over $1,000.      See also: ICO Project Enigma Settles SEC Charges Over $45M Token Sale      This is the latest twist in an increasingly bizarre tale. Launched in 2018 by David Schmidt, a former Republican state senator in Washington State, Meta 1 Coin claimed to have a digital token backed by an art collection valued at over a $1 billion as well as a gold vault worth $2 billion, all audited regularly by KPMG.      The project also promised investors they would make returns of 225,000% from a risk-free investment that would never lose its value.      The SEC has a history of looking sternly at ICOs and this one was no exception. The regulator began legal proceedings against Meta 1 Coin at the end of March. In a strongly worded amended complaint, also filed May 14, the regulator says defendants raised more than $9 million in an unregistered securities offering that was ""nothing but a vehicle to steal investors' money.""      ""The Defendants have variously claimed that the Coin [Meta 1 Coin] is backed by a $1 billion art collection and/or $2 billion in gold. In reality, the coin is backed by nothing,"" the filing reads. The SEC says that $215,000 of the funds raised in the ICO was spent on a Ferrari.      Meta 1 Coin has denied any wrongdoing. At one point the defendants claimed to have turned down an $8 billion offer from a private individual to buy the total coin supply. In a radio show in April 2019, Schmidt and fellow Meta 1 executive trustee Robert Dunlap claimed to have met with the SEC's legal counsel.      ""[Dunlap] had about a one-hour discussion with a man from the SEC,"" claimed Schmidt. ""And the fact that he was so impressed with everything that we're doing, that's absolutely upfront and legal, he came in and bought coins.""      Dunlap subsequently admitted he had, in fact, not met with anyone from the SEC.      See also: SEC Sues Dropil Founders for Fraud After $1.8M Token Sale      CoinDesk received a statement from Dunlap at the time of the SEC's initial complaint. Describing the case as having no merit and being slanderous, he argued Meta 1 Coin was waging a ""holy war"" against the SEC and the wider federal government so as to provide financial freedom to humanity.      ""I am looking forward to dismantling the SEC as they are committing crimes against Humanity in the attempted enforcement of financial slavery,"" he said. Claiming the defendants had increased the collateral backing the coins, he also wrote: ""Meta 1's Service and Victory For Humanity Will Be Everlasting.""      The SEC wants funds to be returned to investors and the defendants hit with civil penalties. The regulator is calling for a lifetime ban for Schmidt, Dunlap and the rest of the Meta 1 Coin team from purchasing, selling or issuing securities.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/28/us-court-freezes-assets-linked-to-alleged-9m-ico-scam,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/51d9178bb9e2b630135ecda7ec83b9c70316202c-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383871,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ysWH,1590676614,Bitcoin Price Tests $9.4K as Demand for Put Options Drops,"Bitcoin's price is gathering upward momentum as traders buy fewer put options, which are bearish bets on the top cryptocurrency.      At press time, bitcoin was changing hands near $9,400, representing a 2% gain on the day, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. On a week-to-date basis, the cryptocurrency is now reporting over 8% gains.      Bitcoin’s recent price rise is accompanied by a slide in demand for put options. Such derivative contracts give the holder the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before the predetermined rate. Meanwhile, a call option gives the holder the right to buy,      The one-month put-call skew, which measures the price of puts relative to that of calls, is currently at 6.6%, down from its multi-month high of 22% on May 22, according to data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew.      The metric fell sharply from 15% to 5% on Wednesday as prices rose from $9,000. This confirms a bullish breakout on technical charts. Essentially, the demand for put options, or bearish bets, has dropped as prices rise.      “The decline in skew is related to higher perceived halving risk since mid-May, causing elevated skews,"" said Luuk Strijers, COO at cryptocurrency derivative exchange Deribit. ""Now the market seems to be less worried about further downward moves reducing the demand for puts.""      Put options drew greater demand after the May 11 reward halving, pushing the one-month skew higher to 20% from 12%. This was possibly due to fears that the cryptocurrency would witness a price pullback similar to the 30% decline seen in the four weeks following the second halving, which took place on July 9, 2016.      A 9% correction happened last week with prices falling from $9,950 to $8,660. The cryptocurrency defended levels below $8,700 multiple times earlier this week before jumping back above $9,000.    Dip demand    As bitcoin fell from $10,000 to $8,630 in the seven days to May 25, the number of addresses holding at least 100 BTC rose from five-year lows, according to data provided by Glassnode.      “Once again, the big players seem to be accumulating into the dip,” analysts at blockchain intelligence firm Santiment noted in a blogpost.      The number of addresses rose from 16,010 to 16,089 during the price decline, a sign of dip demand and investor belief in the long-term bullish story, The number of addresses holding at least 0.01 BTC and 0.1 BTC also reached record highs during the recent price drop.      Technical charts now indicate a scope for a rally toward resistances lined up near $9,850 and $10,000.    4-hour and daily charts    Bitcoin has invalidated the bearish lower highs pattern on the four-hour chart with a convincing move above $9,310 (horizontal line). With that, the positive view put forward by Wednesday’s falling wedge breakout has gained credence.      The cryptocurrency could rise further to resistance located at $9,875, the upper end of the narrowing price range seen on the daily chart. A close above that level would signal a resumption of the rally from the low of $3,867 observed in March.      Meanwhile, the lower end of the narrowing price range is the level to beat for sellers.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/28/bitcoin-price-tests-94k-as-demand-for-put-options-drops,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b13107fda282f4b70756f4e957fdfa7b7ef79304-1652x961.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bayer China revealed in an interview Thursday it had chosen VeChain as tech provider for a new blockchain-powered solution that will allow the firm – a branch of Bayer – to track clinical drugs across the supply chain.      Known as ""CSecure,"" the system loads a batch number relating to a specific drug onto the blockchain. Each drug can then be tracked as it moves across the supply chain, using timestamps and user-identification information at different waypoints. Because of the immutable nature of the blockchain, the data can't be changed by a non-permissioned third party.      Also see: IBM, Merck Declare FDA-Backed Drug Tracing Blockchain a Success      VeChain won the right to work with Bayer China in a competition back in 2019, after it proposed the company consider implementing a blockchain-based supply chain solution. The proposal subsequently went on to become CSecure.      The system is based on ToolChain, a proprietary blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) system that allows VeChain to design and build full distributed ledger technology solutions to a client's specific requirements.      Bayer China is the latest in a series of high-profile partnerships for the blockchain project. Last June, the Chinese arm of supermarket chain Walmart, as well as Big Four accountancy firm PwC teamed up with VeChain to work on a new food tracking solution for China.      However, VeChain isn't saying much about the latest deal. A spokesperson told CoinDesk that the firm is bound by a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and can't divulge further information about how CSecure would actually work ""under the hood.""

Speaking during an online meeting with the country’s parliament, the State Duma, the Bank of Russia’s first deputy chief, Olga Skorobogatove, said a previously launched trial on a decentralized depository system for digital mortgage bonds proved successful.      “We suggested to the government that we refine the project to the point when all kinds of transactions needed for the digital mortgage issuance can be done on Masterchain,” Skorobogatova said. “This platform is working and, without further ado, we can complete this development.”      The official further said six Russian banks have been testing Masterchain for exchanging digital letters of credit, “and some other are ready to join.” Skorobogatova didn’t specify the names of any the banks in that effort, or entities that might participate in the digital mortgage pilot.      CoinDesk confirmed Skorobogatova's statements via an audio recording of the meeting. The Bank of Russia did not respond to a request for additional information by press time.      See also: Russia Considering Draconian Rules for Illegal Crypto Operations      Masterchain was launched in 2017 by the Fintech Association, which is supervised by the Bank of Russia. The project includes participants like Sberbank, Alfa Bank, VTB, Raiffeisenbank Russia and Otkritie, as well as the National Settlement Depository and the federal land registry service, Skorobogatova said.      The project was previously criticized as ""disappointing"" by the blockchain expert of Sberbank, Russia’s largest retail bank.    More projects coming    Skorobogatova said the Bank of Russia’s regulatory sandbox for distributed ledger projects has applications from 50 projects in the pipeline, some of which have already completed pilots.      “We tested two digital assets projects, one for hybrid tokens representing digital rights and goods, and another for tokenization of services,"" she said. ""Both projects got a green light from us, and the companies are now waiting for regulation to be passed so they can launch in Russia.""      Again, the projects were not named. However, one might be the metal tokenization project by Nornickel, Russia’s mining and smelting giant, which was reported as successfully trialed in the regulator’s sandbox in February.

That’s the vision for Torus Labs’ new identity solution, DirectAuth.      The Singapore-based firm released a software development kit (SDK) Thursday for blockchain-agnostic dapp logins. Torus launched its blockchain network and one-click login protocol in February counting eight initial members for its key management system – including Binance, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) and Skale.      The key innovation with DirectAuth compared to the previous Torus offering is blockchain neutrality, Torus Labs CEO and co-founder Zhen Yu Yong said in a phone interview with CoinDesk.      “We’ve abstracted all of the core security features out of the Torus wallet and put it into an SDK so that any application can plug it into the application and interact with trust whilst maintaining their own permissioned structure,” said Yong.      Read more: Torus Launches to Bring One-Click Login to Web 3.0      Torus’ newest product makes dapp logins as easy as accessing your Gmail – a tangible bridge between Web 2.0 and Web 3.0. DirectAuth commits a blockchain transaction on the user’s behalf while maintaining a similar experience to traditional logins, eliminating the need for digging up the private keys or mnemonic passwords common in today’s Web 3.0 products.      Yong said DirectAuth has already integrated with multiple networks including digital card game SkyWeaver, universal basic income project GoodDollar and social platform Sapien.      Arweave CEO Sam Williams told CoinDesk that “simplifying login and key management” for Web 3.0 products was “critical” for mainstream adoption. His storage protocol was one of the first to integrate DirectAuth before the product launched publicly.      Yong also said the product's user interface (UI) was overhauled to put native developers in the driver’s seat. Kyle Samani, managing partner of Multicoin Capital, which led the project’s 2019 $2 million seed round, said the UI’s flexibility is the “most powerful aspect” of DirectAuth as it gives “developers control over the user experience in ways they've never had before.”",POSITIVE,ENS,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | BNB | ENS,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/05/28/torus-goes-blockchain-agnostic-with-new-directauth-dapp-login-tool,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d5fa280d48765e94dac17780fc6f735300e83b24-1500x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383847,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ysC9,1590667200,Handshake Exchange Sees $10M in Token Trades as Race for Censorship-Resistant Websites Heats Up,"The coronavirus crisis may have given one censorship-resistance project a small boost.      There are several startups trying to decentralize the internet’s domain-name infrastructure, including Ethereum Name Service (ENS) and Unstoppable Domains. So far, ENS director of operations Brantly Millegan said the ENS ecosystem has roughly 30,000 Ethereum accounts that own .eth domains, a total of 350,000 unique web names. Unstoppable Domains co-founder Brad Kam said his project has 220,000 registered domains since January 2019, with 8,000 live websites.      Kam said Unstoppable domains generally sold to companies like MyCrypto and the Kyber Network for between $40 and $10,000 each, which even modest estimates indicate as income worth more than $8.8 million. This startup’s business model bets that crypto exchanges and wallets will need censorship-resistant domain options for regulatory arbitrage. Kam said he is passionate about freedom of speech and businesses being able to resist dictators.      Meanwhile, the comparable and highly anticipated web domain project Handshake, which airdropped an estimated $100 million worth of HNS tokens to developers with active GitHub pages, has attracted thousands of participants since it launched in February 2020.      Read more: Handshake Revealed: VCs Back Plan to Give Away $100 Million in Crypto    Tieshun Roquerre, CEO of the Handshake-centric Namebase exchange, said users traded $10 million worth of HNS tokens so far, while claiming web domainshttps://hnscan.com/charts through 80,000 auctions in four months. Community members estimate only a few million dollars worth of HNS was spent on domains – with most of that activity coming from people trading airdropped HNS for other assets like bitcoin.    Roquerre estimated 4,373 people claimed their tokens out of roughly 150,000 eligible recipients, and “some of our users have reached out about coronavirus-related names.”      Although this represents a small portion of the airdropped tokens, the domain name service (DNS) provider NextDNS also offers support for Handshake name resolution.      “More people are using it than we thought, and from what we've seen a few cool handshake-only mini-sites are starting to pop up,” NextDNS CEO Romain Cointepas said.      This year the plan is for NextDNS to run its own HNS nodes, Cointepas said, comparable to running a Simplified Payment Verification bitcoin node. This would let customers use Handshake for top-level domains (TLDs) like .com and .net, “effectively replacing the root servers completely,” Cointepas said.      So far, this primarily appeals to developers with hobby projects who like the idea of completely owning their own website without trusting service providers. Beyond hobbyists, some crypto companies like Brave have claimed their corresponding Handshake web domains as well.      “With Handshake you own it directly with a private key, the way you own bitcoin with a private key,” said HNS user Matthew Zipkin, who built the reference site easyhandshake.com. “As long as you keep that key secure, no one is taking that name from you. … There’s a lot of money and corruption and centralization. The namespace is dominated by ICANN.”      Many believe the current system is relatively public and well-managed. The central body that governs domain space, ICANN, recently rejected an attempt to sell .org domains to the private firm Ethos Capital. Yet, Zipkin said ICANN’s dominance is still problematic because the organization is based in the United States and other tech organizations, like the Microsoft-owned GitHub, stopped offering full services in 2019 to some jurisdictions for fear of American sanctions.      Read more: Planned $1.1B Sale of .Org Angers Many Open Source Crypto Developers      “Handshake doesn’t replace DNS, it extends it,” Zipkin said. “When I’m using a Handshake resolver, that means my internet service provider (ISP) doesn’t know where I’m browsing because I’m not asking them. … Anyone can run a resolver on their computer. They can verify Handshake names trustlessly with minimal data downloads and bandwidth.”      Zipkin said Handshake can also be used with a privacy-enhancing Tor browser, in addition to regular VPN services. Yet some DNS veterans remain skeptical about the prospect that Handshake could achieve commercial traction, beyond hobbyists and crypto startups.    Too fringe    Farsight CEO Paul Vixie, who helped scale DNS and build the system we use today, said that “no one wants to splinter the namespace because that will fragment the market.”      He added at least a dozen startups have tried to achieve Handshake’s same goal – to decentralize DNS infrastructure options – but none have achieved both significant and sustainable traction. Plus, the Handshake community is already being faced with its first legal conundrum over whether it can offer “.music,” another version of which is run by ICANN.      Read more: The Domain Startups Building an Uncensorable Internet on Top of Ethereum      “The commercial community, outside of that [tech bubble] … they are happy with the namespace as is,” Vixie said. “There is no endgame for multiple namespaces. … You can certainly waste a lot of investor money but in the end there’s got to be one that works.”      Speaking to that point, Namebase’s Roquerre said he expects it will take a long time for developers to buy or trade TLDs for business, not pleasure.“In the long term there’s going to be more commercial activity,” Roquerre agreed. “I think the main theme of censorship resistance is generally why people are interested in Handshake, it’s been like that for a long time and it’s continuing.”      Update (May 28, 20:11 UTC): The headline and body of this article have been edited to clarify there were reportedly $10 million worth of HNS trades on Namebase since the token launched, but only a fraction of those users bought domain names.",POSITIVE,ENS,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | KNC | ENS,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/05/28/handshake-exchange-sees-10m-in-token-trades-as-race-for-censorship-resistant-websites-heats-up,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e5c0d5fda5c63cecc7c6fb0bae20d464ff0cf3b1-1500x1122.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383872,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ysXX,1590666424,First Mover: Chainlink 'Marines' Are HODLing and Here's Why You Should Care,"Bitcoin is so speculative and volatile that it doesn’t deserve to be considered an asset class, according to Goldman Sachs.      Diving deeper into the realm of the more than 5,000 cryptocurrencies in existence, things get even more speculative – with traders often jumping on fast-moving and thinly traded tokens for a quick profit and then quickly moving on to the next hot trade.      That’s why it’s so notable that holders of one token, Chainlink (LINK), appear to be in it for the long term.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      Data extracted from the underlying blockchain and cryptocurrency markets reveal declining balances of the token held at exchanges. In the logic of digital-asset traders, that’s seen as a sign that holders of the token have no near-term intention of selling their LINK tokens: After withdrawing the tokens from exchanges, holders are likely either to hoard them or send them to be used in Chainlink smart contracts for off-chain data.      High market capitalization and real users is a rare combination for cryptocurrency protocols. But with Chainlink, backers of the project are so devoted they refer to themselves on social media as “LINK Marines” – a sly reference to the community known as the “XRP Army” that supports the eponymously named token from Ripple. The idea is that LINK investors are “HODLing,” an expression that dates back to early cryptocurrency chat forums and refers to long-term, often ideologically motivated investors.      “Chainlink is the most successful blockchain network over the last two years and we still feel like the underdog,” said Michael Anderson, co-founder of Framework Ventures, which published a Chainlink investment thesis in late 2017.      During a year when traditional assets like U.S. stocks are floundering and bitcoin is up 27%, Chainlink more than doubled, making it the top-performing digital asset among the top 10 ranked by market capitalization, according to OnChainFX. The coin’s market value is now almost $3.8 billion.      Chainlink is a tokenized decentralized network that provides blockchain networks with price feed data collected from sources both on and off blockchains. The protocol offers a potential solution to what is known as the “oracle problem,” or the ability to get the off-chain data needed in many smart contracts. Given that blockchains are intended to operate as ""trustless"" networks, using outside data requires integrating with a trusted source – an ""oracle.""      ""As time goes by, there are definitely some questionable projects that break the top-10 market capitalization ranking for crypto,” said Anil Lulla, analyst at cryptocurrency research firm Delphi Digital, who recently authored a report on blockchain-based oracles. “It's very easy to point to a lot of names on that list and see very little to no usage.”      However, the Delphi Digital team was “impressed at some of the early trends we've been seeing in usage for Chainlink,” Lulla said.      So is it bullish that LINK Marines are HODLing? It’s tough to say, according to Lulla.      A Chainlink spokesperson declined to comment on the data.      In May 2019, the total amount of LINK held on exchanges began to steadily decrease, a trend that would continue for the next 12 consecutive months, according to Glassnode.      Exchange withdrawals coincided with the first significant LINK price inflation, when the token traded above $1.00 for the first time. And as more tokens left cryptocurrency exchanges, trading volume steadily grew, according to Nomics.      So where where did the LINK tokens taken off exchanges go?      The data suggests the Marines are sending their tokens to either their own wallets or Chainlink smart contracts. The percentage of LINK supply held by the top 1% of addresses has grown by almost 25% in the past year, according to Glassnode.      Median transfer value fell by 77% over the same period, suggesting that when LINK Marines decide to actually transfer tokens, their transactions are increasingly small.      LINK is also being sent to smart contracts designed to utilize the protocol’s oracle services. According to Glassnode, the year-to-date supply of LINK in smart contracts grew by 1.3% percent.      The strong price performance has foiled traders who have taken short positions on LINK, betting on a decline in the token’s price.      Such challengers have been “getting their faces ripped off” in markets for over a year, Rob Paone, a popular YouTube crypto personality and startup founder, noted in a March 18 tweet.      At the time of Framework’s investment, according to Anderson, “many of the ‘industry experts’ either said Chainlink was over-engineered,” or that two rival oracle projects, Augur or Uniswap, would ultimately win out.      Yet, the young protocol has inked cross-industry partnerships with Google and Tezos, for example.      And the LINK Marines are staying faithful.      UPDATE (May 28, 2020 15:00 UTC): This piece has been updated to reflect that Chainlink does not operate its own blockchain but functions as a blockchain-agnostic network.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    Trend: Bitcoin is struggling to maintain momentum after Wednesday's convincing break above the psychological hurdle of $9,000.      At press time, the number one cryptocurrency by market value is trading near $9,190, having faced rejection at $9,300 during the Asian trading hours.      The pullback has neutralized the immediate bullish view put forward by a falling wedge breakout on the four-hour chart Wednesday. Further, it has established $9,310 – a lower high created May 24 – as strong resistance.      If buyers can push prices past that threshold, a price rally to $9,850 may be seen. That level is currently housing the upper end of the contracting triangle represented by trendlines connecting May 7 and 18 highs, and May 10 and 25 highs.      The overall bias will stay neutral while the cryptocurrency is held withing the three-week-long narrowing price range on the daily chart. A breakout would imply a continuation of the rally from lows below $4,000 seen on March 13 and open the doors for a test of February high of $10,500.      Alternatively, a move below $8,760 would confirm a range breakdown and shift risk in favor of a deeper decline to support at $8,109 (May 10 low) and $7,900 (100-day average).",POSITIVE,LINK,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | LINK | MARKET | TRADING,"Zack Voell, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/28/first-mover-chainlink-marines-are-hodling-and-heres-why-you-should-care,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e7d0d793fefda308a65f1d81b87706aba5f656c2-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Local news site Tages-Anzeiger reported Wednesday that Heinz Taennler, finance director of the canton of Zug, had been denied a call for assistance for local blockchain startups through a sovereign wealth fund. Taennler had planned to issue loans to local startups, which in turn could be converted into shares.

Taennler had requested the funding package in April in addition to the central government's CHF 154 million ($158.6 million) credit handout for fintech startups, saying the latter would not be sufficient to curb the economic impact of coronavirus.

The tool works by dropping the EnjinCraft file into a player's server ""plug-ins"" folder, where they can then begin integrating and distributing blockchain assets in the form of tokens.      The plug-in marks the second release by Enjin for Minecraft after it initially released DonationCraft in 2013 in collaboration with Bukkit. Now downloaded 5.1 million times, DonationCraft allows players to grow their Minecraft servers by creating a server website and donation store.      See also: Trust No Dapp: Chainlink Launches Oracle for Provable Randomness      The new offering allows server hosts to create their own localized Minecraft economies by providing their players with tangible ownership over in-game items and currencies. It also allows for players to securely trade their assets in peer-to-peer (P2P) fashion through the server or via external chat rooms and digital trading platforms like the Enjin Marketplace.      “EnjinCraft is the beginning of a new era for sandbox games. Players now have a tangible stake in their gaming worlds, and server owners can create new kinds of addictive experiences by using branded collectibles and items with scarcity and value in the digital universe,” said Enjin's co-founder and CTO, Witek Radomski..

The fund – loaded at its August 2017 inception with $140 million in assets – has returned 33% in just the first four months of 2020, two BlockTower investors said. The four-month return beat in that period bitcoin (up 20%, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index), the S&P 500 (down 10% in the biggest drop since the 2008 recession, according to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data) and hedge funds broadly (up 21.4% in crypto and down 4.5% out of it, according to Eurekahedge average return profiles).      Despite the havoc coronavirus wreaked on markets, the fund did better in those four months than the stock index did in any full year since 1997. And as a result of the climb, the fund returned 73% for those who invested from day one and held on through to last month, the investors said. The lifetime return trounced the S&P 500, which returned 18% over the same 33-month period. However, the fund trailed bitcoin, which gained 217%.      Before this year, the fund rounded out a respectable if less spectacular 30% lifetime return for investors, according to a return sheet reviewed by CoinDesk, matching the S&P 500 but underperforming bitcoin’s 162% gains.      Those two and a half years ending in 2019 were choppy as well. The fund swelled 254.5% in 2017, lagging behind the mean return that year of 1,708.5% for crypto hedge funds but surpassing the 8.4% achieved by regular hedge funds, according to Eurekahedge data. Bitcoin by itself fared better than the BlockTower fund that year, gaining 1,296%.      Then, in 2018, the BlockTower fund's holdings contracted 62.8%, compared to losses of 71.8% at Eurekahedge-indexed crypto hedge funds and 3.8% for other hedge funds. Bitcoin fell 72.6%.      Finally, last year, the BlockTower fund rebounded 12% versus a Eurekahedge average 15.6% return for crypto hedge funds and 8.7% for regular hedge funds. Bitcoin outperformed them all, climbing 88.2%.      Read more: Andreessen Horowitz Forecasts Fourth Crypto Bull Cycle      How did BlockTower Capital stage a roaring comeback in the throes of an economically ruinous global pandemic? The firm declined to comment on the record, but another source familiar with BlockTower said, without going into exact strategic calls, that the hedge fund has been deploying spot, derivatives and algorithmic trades to capture returns from extreme movements, market dislocations and sudden volatility like the recent market upheaval.      Beyond bitcoin, on which BlockTower lost $1 million over missed call options that bet the price would soar to $50,000, the hedge fund trades multiple liquid and illiquid cryptocurrencies, according to the return sheet. Illiquidity implies that the coins have low trading volumes on exchanges or token agreements precluding sales to third parties ahead of retail investor buy-in.      The hedge fund “looks across the spectrum of crypto-assets” and switches between holding and liquidating bitcoin, ether, four ether competitors and other coins, said the source. “It really depends on the day, and on the market regime.”    Team building    The shake-up in returns could be a harbinger of what is to come with Wall Street pros entering cryptocurrency investing. BlockTower Capital has been poaching bulge-bracket banking executives left and right to refine its trading strategies.      Last year, Elizabeth Ralston, previously a Goldman Sachs vice president, was hired as BlockTower’s legal director. The year before that, in 2018, Citi accountant and BlueMountain Capital hedge fund manager Michael Bondar took over BlockTower’s operations, and Steve Lee, a Goldman Sachs Tokyo and Singapore portfolio manager, was placed in charge of BlockTower’s Asia investments.      The hires were made by BlockTower’s co-founders at the urging of one of its investors, who said they became concerned when “they had one [trading] position that was way too big, percentage-wise, of their portfolio.”      “They went and got good people out of the finance world,” said the investor.      BlockTower was co-founded by Goldman Sachs vice president Matthew Goetz, BlockTower’s chief executive officer, and Susquehanna Investment Group trader and University of Chicago endowment fund manager Ari Paul, BlockTower’s chief investment officer. Michael Bucella, the second Goldman Sachs vice president at BlockTower, joined as a partner when the fund was conceived.      Prior to the apparently revamped portfolio strategy, the hedge fund’s returns zigzagged from month to month, in keeping with the erratic cryptocurrency markets. The best month, April 2018, gained 49.6%; the worst month, March 2019, lost 30.9%. Returns decreased for 17 months — one in 2017, 10 in 2018 and six in 2019 — and increased 0.9% on average over 29 total trading months.

The fund has managed in 2020 about $60.8 million, factoring in investment returns, withdrawals, subscriptions and fees. BlockTower Capital's individual investors put up at least $1 million, and institutional investors at least $3 million.
