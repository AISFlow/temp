42404181,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhWIJ,1584047107,Makeup Mogul Michelle Phan's Coronavirus Strategy Is Educate and HODL Bitcoin,"Although the coronavirus-induced economic slowdown is hitting every sector, beauty mogul Michelle Phan has a plan.      “I’m starting a podcast this year, called ‘Baby Steps,’” Phan said.      “It’s essentially to help people take steps into adulthood … buying bitcoin, how to store it, what to do with it.”      The 32-year-old entrepreneur, who already has an estimated net worth of $50 million, is looking to work with crypto companies to promote educational content and spread such information on her own channels as well. With her 8.9 million YouTube subscribers and two million Instagram followers, Phan said she wants to use her platform to promote clear and helpful content about bitcoin.      “Now my viewers are hungry for more than makeup and skincare. They want to know how to protect their purchasing power,” Phan told CoinDesk on Wednesday. “Today I made an Instagram post telling my followers to buy the [bitcoin] dip, and then hold.”      Phan is looking to grow her empire, which started with an investment in the four-person music startup Thematic and the blockchain gaming startup Pocketful of Quarters, in addition to the 12-person direct-to-consumer brand Em Cosmetics, which she bought from L'Oreal in 2015. So far Em Cosmetics orders haven’t slowed down, she said, unlike brands that rely on retailers like Sephora to distribute products.      “It’s benefited us, being direct-to-consumer, because that’s what we’re used to. Anyone in retail right now is suffering,” Phan said. “Even luxury brands are taking a huge hit. … So far we’ve been very lucky in having an immense amount of supplies before the virus.”      Indeed, the New York Times reported the beauty industry is in for a rough season. However, Phan’s brand revolves around do-it-yourself tutorials and direct orders. Although she said some of her ingredients come from Italy, South Korea, Japan and to a lesser extent China, manufacturing is often done in the U.S. and she’s already selling out of some products.      Phan hopes supply chains will normalize in a few weeks. If so, she’ll continue with plans to launch several products this year. In the meantime, she’ll diversify her content and focus on building brand awareness beyond makeup tutorials.      “I want to use my platform to shine more light on bitcoin (BTC). There’s so much misinformation. I want to bring more clarity,” she said. “Situations like this are an opportunity for people to learn how to hodl.”      She said many of her followers didn’t know they could buy a fraction of a bitcoin and store it themselves, off of an exchange. That’s about to change.      “Hundreds of DMs came my way saying, ‘We had no idea,’” Phan said. “With coronavirus … when there’s a distrust of authorities, that’s when bitcoin shines the most.”",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/12/makeup-mogul-michelle-phans-coronavirus-strategy-is-educate-and-hodl-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/94132eabb0e46579ac8b64e4315d0a21e22c0dac-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The move by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York comes as investors in traditional Wall Street markets have rushed to snap up U.S. Treasury bonds, historically viewed as a “safe haven” asset in times of turmoil. The flight to safety has pushed down the 10-year note’s yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, to historically low levels below 1 percent.      “These changes are being made to address highly unusual disruptions in Treasury financing markets associated with the coronavirus outbreak,” the New York Fed said in a statement on its website.      The announcement follows announcements by the Fed branch earlier in the week that it would increase the maximum amount of overnight loans provided to Wall Street bond dealers through “repo” markets — essentially short-term collateralized loans — to $175 billion from $100 billion.      The pumping of trillions of dollars of fresh liquidity into the financial system recalled the Federal Reserve’s unprecedented efforts during the crisis of 2008 and the years afterward to ply banks and markets with money in a bid to revive the economy in the wake of Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy.      The New York Fed said Thursday it would initiate the injections as soon as Thursday afternoon, beginning with $500 billion of three-month repo loans.      On Friday, the bank will offer additional repo operations with $500 billion of three-month loans and $500 billion of one-month loans.      “Three-month and one-month repo operations for $500 billion will be offered on a weekly basis for the remainder of the monthly schedule,” according to the statement. “The Desk will continue to offer at least $175 billion in daily overnight repo operations and at least $45 billion in two-week term repo operations twice per week over this period.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/12/in-echo-of-2008-fed-pledges-15-trillion-injection-to-aid-reeling-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4c5b8c6143ceb700cba12e7d698f043f94c26b77-1200x801.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404192,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhWU7,1584039881,"Cash Is the New Safe Haven as Crypto, Gold Continue to Tank","It turns out cold, hard cash with a helping of government bonds — not bitcoin or even gold — is where people turn in the face of a pandemic and market turmoil.       Liquidations set in on the cryptocurrency market the day after the U.S. announced European travel restrictions due to coronavirus fears Wednesday. Bitcoin (BTC) is down 21 percent and ether (ETH) is down 27 percent over the past 24 hours. That's more than the traditional markets, with the Standard & Poor's 500 down nearly 8 percent at 2:45 p.m. ET (1845 UTC).      “It's apocalyptic out there. Traditional safe havens like gold are down,” said Rupert Douglas, head of Business Development, Institutional Sales at Koine.      Traders liquidating holdings on crypto’s bellwether derivatives exchange, BitMEX, fueled some of these moves. Gold also got hit as traders sold the yellow metal for the safety of much-needed cash as losses mounted in equities.      “This downward pressure caused crypto markets to suffer a liquidity crunch as the cost of capital spiked up across trading venues,” said Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Bequant, a London-based digital asset firm.      “This tightening was exacerbated by the fact that the market is highly dominated by sell-side liquidity providers/market-making firms, with only a limited buy-side demand,” he added.      Over $700 million of XBTUSD liquidations have occurred on BitMEX during the past 24 hours, the second-highest daily total in a year.      “Liquidations to satisfy margin calls. This is the worst-case scenario,” said Jason Lu, a cryptocurrency over-the-counter trader based in Asia. For a brief time, Lu noted, BitMEX’s perpetual contract XBTUSD traded at a discount to bitcoin prices on spot exchanges like Coinbase.      For an increasing number of investors, the haven in crisis times seems to be cash, not cryptocurrency or gold. A recent survey conducted by iTrustCapital, a firm that offers cryptocurrency investments in retirement accounts, highlights how safe-haven tendencies have changed since the end of last month.      Those answering “cash in a mattress” as a safe haven jumped from 18 percent of respondents in February to almost 27 percent by March 11. “Gold” as an answer fell from 37 percent to 33 percent during that same period. The survey was conducted before gold’s 3 percent drop on Thursday.      While many cryptocurrency advocates have long likened bitcoin to gold as the ultimate financial haven (“digital gold” is an oft-used phrase), in these times the markets are saying otherwise.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/12/cash-is-the-new-safe-haven-as-crypto-gold-continue-to-tank,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a3dc40047ad0fc23145d4a649d6d843568e6ecd0-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404186,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhWNE,1584039600,Mass Surveillance Threatens Personal Privacy Amid Coronavirus,"COVID-19 is rapidly changing people’s day to day lives across the globe.      China has instituted large-scale lockdowns on travel, quarantining whole cities, while France has banned large gatherings and the U.S. has taken moves to allow huge sections of the workforce to work from home and is even exploring measures to pay hourly workers who are sick or forced to self-quarantine. As the headline of a New York Times op-ed succinctly put it, “Everyone’s a Socialist in a Pandemic.”      As governments look to contain the spread of COVID-19, they’re turning to every tool at their disposal, including large surveillance networks, personal cell phone tracking, and AI and facial recognition. In the interest of preserving a society's health, it makes sense to use every option available. But it does raise privacy questions that will need to be addressed when the virus (hopefully) has moved on. What’s good in an emergency response situation may not be suitable for normal day to day life, as we arguably learned in the aftermath of 9/11, as government surveillance capacities have greatly increased and big tech has built whole businesses models based on sifting through and finding value in our data.      In China, SenseTime, a highly valued AI firm, is being deployed in multiple cities in order to identify people with elevated temperatures, as well as those who aren’t wearing face masks. On its website, the company touts its “Smart AI Epidemic Prevention Solutions.” The company calls it a “quick and effective system in screening and detecting individuals with elevated temperature in a crowd. The AI-powered solution can be deployed at building entrances and public spaces including airports, train and subway stations, as well as office buildings. The solution enables supporting staff to identify individuals with a fever – an indicating symptom of coronavirus infection – without direct body contact, minimizing the risk of cross-infection.”      See also: Chinese Crypto and Blockchain Firms Grapple With Coronavirus Outbreak      SenseTime told the BBC its tech has been deployed in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. Other companies such as Megvii advertise a similar product, which has been rolled out in Beijing, according to the company, and describes it as an “AI-enabled temperature detection solution that integrates body detection, face detection and dual sensing via infrared cameras and visible light.”      In Russia, facial recognition technology has been deployed to ensure that quarantined individuals do not leave their homes or hotels.      It’s not just external cameras being used to track individuals. It’s also the very device many people take with them everywhere, our smartphones. Telecom companies in China are handing over records of customers' movements to the government as well as letting users know if they have been in an impacted area recently, while places such as Singapore have worked to trace infected individuals’ movements through data from ride-sharing apps, Monash University academics, in Australia, found.    Events such as the 2008 Beijing Olympics, and the 2010 Shanghai Expo, have allowed mass surveillance techniques to become the norm in China. The same could happen with Coronavirus.    Meanwhile, the state-owned China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC) launched a new government platform, Close Contact Detector, which pulls publicly available transit data from the Ministry of Transport, China Railway and China's aviation authority and combines it with information from health authorities. Users can access the service via Alipay, WeChat and QQ.      Apps themselves can be used to track users’ locations over the course of their lifetimes. One of the most egregious examples is the the system called Health Code, which dictates freedom of movement, whether people should be quarantined, or even allowed into public spaces, while also sharing location data with police.      Analysis by the New York Times “found that as soon as a user grants the software access to personal data, a piece of the program labeled ‘reportInfoAndLocationToPolice’ sends the person’s location, city name and an identifying code number to a server.”      There is little to no transparency as to how the app functions, what data it collects and where the data is sent.      “With the coronavirus outbreak the idea of risk scoring and restrictions on movement quickly became reality,” Maya Wang, a senior China researcher for Human Rights Watch, told the Guardian. “Over time we see more and more intrusive use of technology and less ability of people to push back.”      “It’s mission creep,” she said. “The techniques of mass surveillance became more permanent after these events.”      Events such as the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2010 Shanghai Expo have allowed mass surveillance techniques to become the norm in China. The same could happen with the coronavirus.      See also: China Has Many Strategic Reasons to Invest in Blockchain      Officials in Wuhan are stepping up their data collection requirements, looking at retail purchases and taxi rides as data for pandemic predictive analysis, according to the South China Morning Post.      It’s fair to argue these measures are necessary as the world grapples with a pandemic it hasn’t seen the likes of in a decade. But the Chinese government has a habit of saying the quiet part loud.      ""In the era of big data and internet, the movements of each person can be clearly seen,” Li Lanjuan, an adviser to the National Health Commission, said on national television, according to the BBC.      But these are extreme measures taken to address an extreme situation. They should not be treated as normal, reasonable or inevitable. To do so means they might just outlast the scope of the pandemic and fundamentally change the lives of billions of people.

42404184,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhWMF,1584038452,DeFi Leader MakerDAO Weighs Emergency Shutdown Following ETH Price Drop,"A large drop in the price of ether (ETH) is testing the feasibility of Ethereum's entire system of lending and borrowing.      MakerDAO is the largest and most important application in Ethereum's decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Right now, it faces an emergency shutdown with $4 million of its dollar-pegged dai stablecoin not backed by an underlying crypto asset, according to a stakeholder call held Thursday.      If a shutdown were to occur, the crypto market would be flooded with some 2.4 million ETH even as the asset’s value plummets amid broader market turmoil.      A spokesperson for the MakerDAO Foundation told CoinDesk: ""The MakerDAO community and the Maker Foundation have been working hand in hand to monitor, assess and resolve the current situation.""      The Maker protocol works by creating dai loans when users load ETH or Basic Attention Token (BAT) into the system as collateral. Maker then automatically sells that collateral when the market tanks in order to get DAI off the market until the system hits its 150 percent collateral target. But the price dropped too sharply for MakerDAO's automated auctions to keep up.      Last night at 22:00 UTC, ETH was trading at approximately $194, according to CoinDesk’s Ethereum Price Index, only to fall to a low of $124 at about 12:44 UTC today.      The total dollar value of crypto locked in DeFi protocols has plummeted over 20 percent in USD terms overnight (from $889 million to $691 million, as of this writing) – this despite the fact that the total ETH in DeFi has actually increased some 200,000 ETH. The most likely driver: users with loans on Maker looking to boost their collateralization to head off a liquidation.      The MakerDAO Foundation and holders of the MKR governance token are trying to decide what to do right now. Options on the table include lowering the dai savings rate, extending the length of time for liquidation auctions and even triggering the emergency shutdown, effectively a system reboot of MakerDAO.      ""We are in a brave new world here,"" Rich Brown, the foundation's head of community, said on the call, describing some of the complexities of an open format governance approach. ""If we had a dictator just tell us what to do it'd be so much simpler.""      In an emergency shutdown, new CDPs are frozen, auctions finalize and remaining dai can be redeemed for ETH at a fixed price set at the time of the shutdown.      “If MakerDAO experiences an emergency shutdown, DAI becomes redeemable for the ether backing all of the DAI outstanding,"" Robert Leshner, founder of DeFi protocol Compound Finance, told CoinDesk. ""It stops behaving like a stablecoin and begins behaving like ether, price-wise. This will have unintended consequences for the entire ecosystem, some of which have planned for the possibility of this event, and others that have not.”      The MakerDAO community does not have a rule of thumb for a metric that would trigger an emergency shutdown.      “This certainly seems like a very rare 'black swan' event,” Tom Bean, co-founder and CEO of trading platform bZx, told CoinDesk. “I don’t recall the last time things fell this hard and fast and caused this much congestion.”    What's next?    The Maker community is in the middle of a hot debate now.      As one community member who serves as a forum admin put it, ""Ideally we'd already have emergency response procedures in place. We didn't so we are figuring out what to do.""      The system’s first automated move is to keep putting new MKR into the market until the protocol can buy back 4 million dai. This will work so long as MKR's value holds up enough in that time. The price is currently down 46 percent.      The community is also considering adjusting the two settings mentioned above (auction time and 0-dai bids).      There are also more complex moves that the community could make so that it takes both less capital and less technical skill to serve as a keeper. More people in the market should make it more likely for ETH to sell at a fair price in a liquidation, but of course the problem remains: Liquidation is profitable when liquidators get a discount on an asset that's somewhat stable.      At this time, the mood inside the Maker forum is moving against the emergency shutdown because doing so would impose a cost on dai holders.      Dai holders would pay the cost because at the end of the shutdown, the leftover ETH would be worth less in total than the dai in U.S. dollar terms.      As Ryan Berckmans, a DeFi entrepreneur who is normally found in prediction markets, put it in a summary of today's emergency call, ""The social contract of MakerDAO is that MKR tokens take a haircut in the event of system failure.""      Issuing new MKR accomplishes this because it dilutes all the MKR holders, including large ones such as crypto investment funds Dragonfly, Paradigm and Andreessen Horowitz, among others.      Berckmans closed his summary with his personal perspective, writing:      ""Keepers and MKR buyers should prepare for sustained high gas prices, and downward pressure on ETH and MKR. The Dow Jones hit sell-off circuit breakers three times in the past week and a half. It’s a historic week.”      Update (March 12, 21:54 UTC): This piece has been updated with more information about the MakerDAO system's unexpected under-collateralization and a summary of the community's discussion of its next steps.      Update (March 23, 0:30 UTC): Corrects a transcription error in Rich Brown's quote.

42374497,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZzzJ,1584032525,US Charges Dutch National With Running Crypto-Funded Child Porn Site,"U.S. prosecutors indicated a Dutch national Thursday for allegedly spearheading a rape and child pornography website that’s made over $1.6 million worth of bitcoin selling videos since 2012.  Known as “Michael R.M.,” and “Mr. Dark,” the man allegedly ran a site called “DarkScandals” that operated on the darknet, which requires special software to access, and on the public clearnet. He allegedly sold over 2,000 videos and had ties to 303 virtual currency accounts, according to a press release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia.  Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) funded the bulk of the operation, according to the complaint against the man filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Customers allegedly sent the cryptocurrencies as payment for videos or could upload their own. Their video submissions had to follow “specific rules,” though. As detailed extensively in the complaint, the videos had to be explicitly “obscene.”  “The types of crimes described in this indictment are the most disgusting I’ve encountered in 30 years of law enforcement,” said Don Fort, chief of the Internal Revenue Service’s Criminal Investigation team (IRS-CI), in a press release. “It is a special kind of evil to prey on and profit from the pain of others.”  Federal agents discovered DarkScandals while investigating the Welcome to Video case last year. That operation led to hundreds of arrests, the seizure of hundreds of thousands of videos and the dismantling of what was deemed the “largest darknet child pornography website” by investigators at the time.  It also led investigators straight to DarkScandals, the complaint said. “A subsequent review of a Washington, D.C.-based 'Welcome to Video' customer’s virtual currency records lead to the discovery of the DarkScandals sites.”  The case serves as another reminder that cryptocurrencies are a double-edged sword for criminals. On the one hand, transactions cannot be blocked by a regulated third party like a bank or payment processor; on the other hand, they leave a trail of crumbs for investigators that is difficult to obscure.  Agents with IRS and Homeland Security Investigations traced 303 digital currency transactions in the course of this latest investigation. The IRS had used Chainalysis’ transaction tracing software in the Welcome to Video investigation, but a spokesperson for Chainalysis declined to comment on this most recent one.  “If you thought you were anonymous, think again,” Fort said.  U.S. investigators worked in partnership with the Dutch National Police, Europol and the German Federal Criminal Police in parallel investigations, according to DOJ.  Prosecutors are seeking to charge the man on nine counts and seize the operation’s digital currency holdings. It was not immediately clear if he is in custody.

42404190,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhWQB,1584029635,In Defense of Blockchain Voting,"Gregory Magarshak is founder and CEO of Intercoin. Since 2011 he has built a decentralized social networking platform that has reached seven million users to date, and is working on tools to help bring power back into the hands of people and local communities.      For every technology we use today, there was a time it was laughably inadequate as a replacement for what came before. For decades, chess engines were a mere curiosity, but now a smart phone can beat any grandmaster. The same is now true of voting technology.      As we look back on the recent failures of apps to secure our elections, from failing in Iowa to a few days later leaking millions of voter records in Israel, we are reminded that technology, especially in the hands of smaller contractors, can be fallible, and lead to massive data leaks.      See also: CoinDesk's Post-Trust Election Coverage      Many people say we don’t need tech to secure our elections, that paper ballots have been good enough for centuries. But is that really true? George W Bush was elected U.S. president in 2000 not because he got more delegates in the end, but because the recount of paper ballots took so long the Supreme Court had to step in and make a decision. The Iraq War may have never happened if we didn’t use paper ballots. The recent coronavirus epidemic also raises health concerns about shared voting facilities versus using personal touchscreen devices.      Crypto and “Byzantine Consensus” was supposed to finally secure our elections. But so far dominant blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum have not been scalable enough to handle millions of people paying, or voting, all at once.    For every technology we use today, there was a time it was laughably inadequate as a replacement for what came before.    But a new generation of open-source innovation and protocols like Intercoin, MaidSAFE and Holochain, is showing how to build provably secure, scalable infrastructure that can handle voting and economies at scale.      These new protocols are not based around a monolithic blockchain and do not have a central bottleneck such as a “miner” or a “mining pool.” Instead, each entity (a coin, a file or group activity) is secured by a small subset of the whole network, called a “shard” or a “section.”      Much of this technology is not new. In fact, it predates bitcoin. BitTorrent and other peer-to-peer file-sharing systems are based on a technique called Kademlia, developed in 2004. These kinds of sharded networks can scale indefinitely, their embarrassingly parallel architecture supporting a practically unlimited number of simultaneous transactions. The networks are not just peer-to-peer, but also have the ability to aggregate results, for voting and other community applications. And all of this is done without “layer 2” solutions, which are almost always centralized “cop-outs” from an otherwise trustless infrastructure.    Central vulnerability    Traditional networks are vulnerable because trust is concentrated in a single place – whether money, data or votes. This makes it economically attractive for both external and internal actors to try to subvert the guarantees we have come to rely on. John Dillinger didn’t waste his time robbing piggy banks. Brands won’t buy personal data from random sites with 20 users.      A bitcoin wallet contains endlessly divisible balances (called “UTXOs” in bitcoin parlance). Because of this endless division, each full node must hold the entire history of every transaction just in case some of those balances may have come from fake transactions.      An ethereum wallet contains token balances stored inside a smart contract on an Ethereum network. As more and more money is exchanged for this token, its total supply becomes very valuable and the smart contract becomes an attractive target for malicious actors. This is why it has been so hard to shard ethereum. If, for example, each smart contract was secured only by a few nodes, then at some point it could become economically attractive to attack this consensus, either to change some balances or just prevent further progress and kill the token. Either way, it is a bad outcome for the network.      Intercoin wallets, on the other hand, hold coins, each one worth very little and watched by a small, effectively random group of nodes. Paying exact change is achieved by coins of denominations of 1/2, 1/4 and so on down, and interacting with “change bots” – accounts that exchange a coin for an equal amount of change. Coins on the MaidSAFE network (called “safecoins”) work similarly.      The key is, there is a natural limit on how much individual coins are worth. There are no UTXOs or Token Contracts worth $50 Million. To attack the consensus, an attacker would have to infiltrate and subvert most or all of the nodes in one particular shard (called a “section” in MaidSAFE), but all they would take over is one small coin. To gain any significant amount of value, they’d need to attack a proportional amount of the network. Each individual attack becomes more and more difficult as the network grows, let alone the combined attacks to net anything of value.      This means large transactions must involve large transfers of coins, just as ransom and drug deals in movies are done with large suitcases of $100 bills, each one presumably not trivial to obtain. Thus, such networks are suited for smaller, everyday payments with proportional fees, rather than storing and transferring huge amounts of value for a fixed fee. Where bitcoin and ethereum help store value, Intercoin and Maidsafe enable the other side of money – a scalable means of exchange.    Election Merkles    So, how does that help us trust our elections to an app? The truth is, blockchain technology is not enough. You need to string together several solutions at once, including a way of distributing one token to each voter; Merkle trees (or hash trees) that record information sequentially and allow multi-person verification; include several independent vendors, so voters can check, from different “user agents”, their vote recorded on the Merkle tree; and private keys for every voter.      The crypto community has already implemented much of this machinery to secure more valuable things than a single vote. Ethereum, for example, is built on a blockchain secured by many mutually distrusting parties. People may trust their favorite wallet client, but they will also verify using another wallet or a web based blockchain explorer such as Etherscan. The chances of all these entities colluding to steal someone’s tokens become smaller as more clients software is released and more miners secure the back-end network.      See also: How Democracy Breaks: Everything That Could Go Wrong With the Election      Towards the bottom of the Merkle tree, on the level of individual precincts, individual results do not represent juicy targets to subvert. The payoff is small – 1 percent of an Iowa delegate, perhaps. By the time the results have been entered on higher levels of the tree, though, they have been checked by a growing pyramid of multiple distrusting parties on every lower level, and fixed in a way that by then is mathematically infeasible to reverse.      Each individual voter would be able to record his or her Merkle branch, in order to check that their vote was recorded and counted correctly. At each level in the tree, mutually distrusting witnesses agreed that they came together and recorded a result correctly. With information being deleted at every step, no one can verify how someone else voted, unless that other person chooses to reveal their vote and Merkle branch. A system could even be constructed where voters can furnish confidential zero-knowledge proofs of how they voted, without the recipients being able to prove it to anyone else.      In a way, Bitcoin and Ethereum are like MySpace and Friendster – the first iterations of a new industry that will tackle trustless computing in increasingly sophisticated things. Ethereum’s blockchain is monolithic, completely public and anyone can check anything. But if new technology will bring down the cost of running elections you can trust, then every organization large and small will want to do one. And they may not want everyone to know the results – they may want privacy inside the organization.    Crypto can liberate people to form communities and get things done without needing to hand over massive amounts of trust and control to third parties.    This set of requirements for privacy calls for additional innovations that are now starting to be implemented by the crypto community (here “crypto” is being used in its original sense, meaning cryptography), including group encryption, group signatures and end-to-end encryption where research is ongoing about how to efficiently perform mathematical operations on encrypted data without knowing the original values.      We may never completely get away from having to trust some entity that tries to ensure each person isn’t using multiple identities to vote, but studies have shown this happens exceedingly rarely when people vote in person. As people are able to vote from their couch, away from prying eyes, we may come to rely more and more on “verified identity” services to solve this remaining security issue. Efforts to standardize and innovate in this area are ongoing and perhaps one day we will even be able to obviate this final need to trust third parties.      But until then, projects like Intercoin, Holochain and MaidSAFE represent a way forward for decentralized crypto infrastructure to finally let us as a society engage in payments, voting, governance, and other scalable activities. Technology and crypto can liberate people to form communities and get things done without needing to hand over massive amounts of trust and control to third parties.

42404189,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhWRA,1584029108,Down 26%: Bitcoin Sees Worst Sell-Off in 7 Years as Coronavirus Spurs Flight to Safety,"Bitcoin (BTC) suffered its biggest drop in seven years, as fears over the spreading coronavirus triggered a new wave of selling in everything from stocks and junk bonds to cryptocurrencies. This came despite a new European Central Bank pledge to pump more cash into panicky markets.       Prices for the largest cryptocurrency by market value plunged 26 percent to $5,863 as of 13:54 UTC (9:54 a.m. Eastern time). The move wiped out bitcoin’s gains for the year, dropping prices to the lowest level since May 2019. At least for now, it has undermined the investment narrative that the cryptocurrency was starting to become a safe-haven asset similar to the traditional-market alternatives of U.S. Treasury bonds and gold.       “You’re getting to a point where markets are pretty frantic across the board, and today is a move toward cash,” said Kevin Kelly, lead analyst at the cryptocurrency-analysis firm Delphi Digital in New York. “Bitcoin and crypto in general still very much sit further out the risk curve in investors’ minds.”       Just overnight, bitcoin’s market capitalization slid by nearly $40 billion to about $107 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.com, a data provider.       The stocks tumbled the day after President Donald Trump ordered a 30-day ban on visitors from Europe, to start later this week. The S&P 500 Index of U.S. stocks slid 7.7 percent.       Investors appeared to seek safety in U.S. Treasuys, with yields on the 10-year note dropping by 0.15 percentage point to 0.67 percent, close to a historic low. Bond yields fall when prices rise.       Not soothed by ECB    A widely anticipated meeting by the European Central Bank, led by President Christine Lagarde, did little to assuage investors’ anxiety, even as the monetary policymakers approved plans to pump liquidity into markets, with a pledge to buy an additional 120 billion euros ($134 billion) of bonds and assets over the rest of the year. However, the ECB did not cut interest rates.       Thursday’s sell-off in bitcoin extended across the cryptocurrency landscape, with ether (ETH), XRP (XRP) and litecoin (LTC) each tumbling in synch.       “If bitcoin's going to sell off by 25 percent, everything that is even more speculative is going to sell off as well, and that’s what you're seeing today among the major digital assets,” said Greg Cipolaro, co-founder of Digital Asset Research, a cryptocurrency analysis firm in New York.       Bitcoin’s price decline led to the liquidation of more than $700 million of futures contracts and other leveraged positions on BitMEX, a cryptocurrency exchange based in Seychelles, according to the research firm Skew.       Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the London-based digital-asset firm Bequant, said at least $500 million of bitcoin futures contracts had been liquidated on cryptocurrency exchanges, leading to additional selling pressure and exacerbating the price decline.       The most-recent data from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange showed traders categorized as “other reportables” — those that aren’t classified as asset managers or leveraged funds — had become “long,” or unusually loaded up on contracts designed to profit from price increases.      “We were due for a bit of a squeeze,” he said.

42404182,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhWJI,1584026364,UK Financial Regulator: Watch Out for Coronavirus Crypto Scams,"The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is asking investors to watch out for coronavirus-related crypto scams.      In a March 11 warning to the public, FCA, the U.K’s top financial regulator, said scammers may attempt to take advantage of the fast-spiraling global pandemic, which has infected some 460 U.K. residents and killed eight.      “Watch out for scams related to coronavirus (COVID-19),” the FCA wrote. “These scams take many forms and could be about insurance policies, pensions transfers or high-return investment opportunities, including investments in cryptoassets.”      The warning came the same day the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic with more than 120,000 infected so far. At press time the situation was growing more chaotic: Italy, China and New Rochelle, N.Y., are in various states of lockdown; universities are moving their classes online; businesses are going remote; and financial markets are wiping away a decade of steady gains.      Against this, the FCA warned of “too good to be true” investments, particularly those in crypto. It borrowed a familiar refrain from past FCA cryptoasset warnings: “If you decide to invest in something offering a high return or in a cryptoasset, you should be prepared to lose all your money.”      Fraudsters are also trying to exploit the coronavirus pandemic with phony pleas for bitcoin donations to WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to the City of London’s National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB).      The cyber-crime clearinghouse said these crypto-coronavirus scams have largely failed. Of the 21 coronavirus scams NFIB has reported since February, only a minority actually demanded victims’ bitcoin, and none of those worked. Other, non-crypto coronavirus scams have swindled over £800,000, though.

42404183,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhWLG,1584025200,Chase Bank Settles Suit Over 'Sky-High' Credit Card Charges for Crypto Purchases,"A class-action lawsuit accusing JPMorgan Chase of overcharging customers using their credit cards to purchase cryptocurrencies has been settled out of court.      Plaintiffs Brady Tucker, Ryan Hilton and Stanton Smith notified the U.S. Southern District Court in New York they reached a settlement with the defendant, Chase Bank. As per a court order signed by Judge Katherine Polk Failla dated March 10, the proceedings have now been discontinued.      The class action was first brought in April 2018, when Tucker complained Chase had charged him more than $160 in fees and interest for regularly purchasing cryptocurrencies from Coinbase using his credit card.      Tucker accused the bank of violating the Truth in Lending Act for not informing customers that crypto purchases were being treated as ""cash advances,"" which incur higher fees. He also complained the bank refused to refund the charges to affected customers.      ""[T]he complete lack of fair notice to Chase’s cardholders caused them to unknowingly incur millions of dollars in cash advance fees and sky-high interest charges on each and every crypto purchase,"" reads the original complaint.      The bank did not charge similar fees for purchases made on debit cards.      In February 2018, Chase, like some other U.S. consumer banks, banned users from purchasing crypto on their credit cards. Even though JPMorgan revealed its own blockchain-based settlements solution and ""JPMCoin"" token in 2019, the ban on crypto purchases on credit cards has not been lifted.      Details of the settlement have not been disclosed. The plaintiffs have 75 days from the date of the court order to resume proceedings.

42404194,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhWV6,1584023728,Bitcoin's Crash Triggers Over $700M in Liquidations on BitMEX,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) flash crash on Thursday triggered the most long-short liquidations on crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX in 16 months.       The top cryptocurrency by market capitalization fell from $7,200 to a 10-month low of $5,678 in just 15 minutes at around 10:45 UTC, catching most traders off guard and forcing liquidations worth $702 million on BitMEX. That’s the highest amount since Nov. 14, 2018, according to crypto derivatives research firm Skew.       The price drop triggered $698 million worth of sell liquidations and $4 million worth of buy liquidations.       The Seychelles-based exchange had registered total liquidations of $750.8 million on Nov. 14, 2019, when bitcoin’s price dropped sharply from $6,000 to levels below $5,000.       A sell liquidation on BitMEX occurs when the market moves adversely against a long position (a bullish bet) and breaches the liquidation price – a predetermined limit. When that happens, the liquidation engine closes down the long position automatically.       Sell liquidations represent forced unwinding of long positions, while buy liquidations represent forced unwinding of short positions.    Long squeeze    While both long and short positions have been liquidated, more than 90 percent of the liquidations are of long positions. It indicates the leverage was heavily skewed to the bullish side.       A sudden price drop almost always results in a long squeeze, which in turn adds to the downward pressure around the cryptocurrency, leading to an exaggerated price drop.       Bitcoin’s quick slide to 10-month lows below $5,700 was followed by a temporary recovery, which saw prices rebound to $6,700. At press time, bitcoin is changing hands just below $6,000, representing a 24 percent slide on a 24-hour basis.       “We believe there is a strong support in this area,” Joel Kruger, currency strategist at LMAX Group, said in a statement, while adding further that “players who were committed ahead of the late 2017 rally would be happy to increase their exposure now in anticipation of bitcoin realizing its objective of being a safe haven and store of value.”       So far, the cryptocurrency has not found love as an anti-risk asset. In fact, the recent drop from $10,500 to $5,700 has been an accompaniment of the deteriorating global outlook and a sell-off in the global equity markets.    Volatility rises    With the big price move, bitcoin’s implied volatility on three-month options has jumped to 3.9 percent on a daily basis (74.5 percent on an annualized basis) – the highest level since Jan. 9.       Implied volatility is a measure of how risky or volatile an asset is expected to be in the future. Volatility has a positive impact on options prices. The higher the uncertainty (volatility) the stronger the hedging demand is for both call and put options.       The spike in three-month volatility essentially means traders are now expecting bitcoin price volatility to remain elevated over the next 12 weeks or so.     Ether drops    As bitcoin’s price crashed, the price of ether (ETH), the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, fell to a two-month low of $128. At press time, ether is trading at $137, down 30 percent on the day.       Ether’s price slide triggered liquidations worth $32 million on BitMEX – the highest since April 2, 2019, when a strong bullish move forced liquidations worth $33.3 million. A similar spike in liquidations occurred during Sept. 25’s double-digit price slide.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/12/bitcoins-crash-triggers-over-700m-in-liquidations-on-bitmex,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c4c9ed2457de90d2b7fa7a03492d704a6484bce5-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ether fell from close to $200 to about $132 as of press time over a 24-hour period, according to CoinDesk's price index, marking the asset's biggest drop in percentage terms in its five-year history as of 13:30 UTC.      According to Nomics, ether's price fell roughly $50 in eight hours, seeing its steepest decline during a $30 fall between 9:00 UTC and 10:00 UTC. Ether's trading volume ballooned in that time, rising from $667.6 million to $1.58 billion.      As of press time, volume had dropped to $253.7 million. However, according to Etherscan, there are more than 100,000 pending transactions currently on the network, a sign of high activity.

Ether's price began to rebound in early-afternoon UTC trading, rising to $143, for a 24-hour drop of 27.7 percent shortly after the publication of this article.      In terms of absolute numbers, ether saw greater declines during the 2018 bear market. At its peak, ether was worth around $1,400 and saw price swings of several hundred dollars.      Thursday's drop comes amid broader market turmoil.      Bitcoin fell to below $6,000 for the first time since May 2019, and the U.S. stock market opened to massive losses triggering a temporary trading halt within 10 minutes.

42404180,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhWKH,1584022065,IOTA Founder Personally Refunding Hack Losses to 'Safeguard' Project's Remaining Reserves,"An IOTA executive is personally reimbursing victims of February's Trinity wallet hack in order to ""preserve"" the project's runway, he told CoinDesk.      The founder of the distributed ledger network, David Sonstebo, said he would repay people affected by the $2 million hack from his own IOTA holdings. The ""main motivation for the decision"" had been to ""safeguard the IOTA Foundation's runway"" over the next 12 months, he added.      The foundation was forced to suspend the IOTA network in February after hackers stole more than 8.5 million in IOTA's native token MIOTA, worth approximately $1.4 million at the time of writing. The network only came fully back online again on Tuesday.      Sonstebo announced he would personally reimburse victims earlier this week, following weeks of internal discussion. ""It's just preemptive step in the worst-case scenario of something drastic happening overnight,"" he said.      IOTA has predominately funded itself from a pot of community donations of MIOTA tokens, held in an endowment fund administered by its foundation. Like many other digital assets, MIOTA has been hit hard by the market turmoil arising from fears over coronavirus pandemic. The token's price fell by 40 percent over the past seven days, and its total market value was down around $270 million at the time of writing.      ""We are very cognizant of our runway and we spend very responsibly; of course, when the token price or the crypto market as a whole has been in such a bear market it's definitely been on our mind from time to time,"" Sonstebo said. ""It's not like we're in any panic mode or desperate, but we are taking the necessary steps [such as by] using my own personal holdings, rather than the foundations' holdings.""      Although Sonstebo emphasized the foundation was ""well funded at the moment,"" it has started diversifying revenue, trying to identify new ventures so they no longer have to rely solely on the endowment fund.      Foundation co-founder Dominik Schiener said to CoinDesk that IOTA ""regularly gets grants from governments,"" having already received four so far this year. He didn't specify which governments he was referring to, the size of the investments or what they were funding.      Sonstebo said IOTA has also received funding from some big corporates who ""are paying for the development of the joint ventures."" That includes, according to Schiener, some members of the IOTA working group founded back in February.      ""I believe we will, by the end of this year, be sustainable without the token endowment being touched,"" Sonstebo said.      Until then, the IOTA project finds itself sailing between ever-tightening fiscal straits. ""In the long term, over the next 12 months, we hope that the majority of our costs will be covered by grants and revenue streams,"" Sonstebo said, ""but at the moment right now it's just important that over the next month we continue without any disturbance or any concern about the runway.""      ""While the IOTA Foundation is well funded at the moment, we still have a long road ahead,"" the founder said.",POSITIVE,IOTA,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | WALLET | IOTA,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/12/iota-founder-personally-refunding-hack-losses-to-safeguard-projects-remaining-reserves,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/95a3e3de7a6597f5081e154223bdd3e9e6b178ce-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404193,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhWT8,1584010630,Bitcoin Hits 10-Month Low Below $6K as Stocks Plunge in Massive Sell-Off,"Bitcoin is in turmoil on Thursday as another severe sell-off is seen in the traditional markets.      The top cryptocurrency by market value plunged to as low as $5,678 – the lowest level since May 2019 – soon before press time. That represents a 25 percent drop on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. However, just as quickly, prices rebounded to over $6,550.      Meanwhile, major European equity market indices like Germany’s DAX, France’s CAC and U.K.’s FTSE 100 are down at least 6 percent at press time. Meanwhile, futures on the S&P 500 are shedding over 4.5 percent. Asian equities also took a beating with Japan’s Nikkei index losing 4.5 percent.      The risk aversion, which began two weeks ago, worsened during the Asian trading hours after President Donald Trump announced a 30-day ban on travel from most of Europe and failed to meet investor expectations for additional fiscal stimulus measures to counter the coronavirus epidemic.      While stocks and bitcoin are down, gold, a classic haven asset, is struggling to eke out gains. The yellow metal is currently trading largely unchanged on the day at $1,642 per ounce, having printed a low of $1,630 earlier.      U.S. Treasury bonds, also a safe haven under normal conditions, dropped on Wednesday, pushing yields higher despite the massive sell-off on Wall Street. The 10-year Treasury yield rose more than 10 basis points to 0.89 percent even though the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 5.9 percent.      The traditional safe havens are struggling right now, possibly because the institutions are liquidating positions in these assets to fund margin calls in the equity markets.      A margin call occurs when the value of the investor’s leverage account drops below the minimum margin requirement. The investor is then required to bring in additional capital or securities to build back the account up to the minimum margin requirement.      ""We started seeing institutional liquidity issues today. For the first time since the beginning of the bear market neither U.S. Treasury bonds nor gold managed to hedge an S&P decline,"" angel investor and Messari's head of product Qiao Wang tweeted early Thursday.      See also: Bitcoin’s Crash Triggers Over $700M in Liquidations on BitMEX      Meanwhile, Bloomberg Markets' Jonathan Ferro referred to Wednesday as the worst day of the last few weeks, as stocks tanked while Treasury yields rose, highlighting liquidity stress in the market.      In fact, the hunger for liquidity was so strong on Wednesday that a model portfolio of 50 percent treasuries and 50 percent stocks fell by the most on record, according to Bloomberg’s cross-asset reporter Luke Kawa.      “People are raising cash to meet redemptions and margin calls. Market liquidity is freezing up, people are struggling to trade. The buy the dip mentality has totally flipped,” Ferro tweeted during Asian trading hours.    Source of liquidity?    Some investors think bitcoin is also being treated as a source of liquidity.      “How did BTC go from being a hedge against bad stuff to getting washed out and trading like a risk asset? When things go from bad to very, very bad like they did last week, investors take leverage down as fast as they can. They book profits to make up for other losses,” billionaire investor and CEO of Galaxy Digital Michael Novogratz tweeted earlier this week as an explanation for bitcoin’s 13 percent slide in late February. The S&P 500 had suffered a double-digit drop during the same week.      Bitcoin’s futures market data validates Novogratz’s claim to some extent. The global open interest or the total number of outstanding futures contracts have dropped sharply over the last few weeks, signaling a slowdown in institutional activity.      Open interest topped out at highs above $5 billion on Feb. 14 and fell to nearly $3.8 billion to hit the lowest in nearly two months, according to Skew data.      Meanwhile, both the open interest and trading volumes in futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, one of the most liquid futures markets, have also dropped sharply over the last couple of weeks.      Open interest fell to $171 million on Wednesday, the lowest level since Jan 6, having hit a high of $338 million on Feb. 14. Trading volume also hit a three-month low of $88 million on March 6, before witnessing a brief spike on March 9.      “It looks like institutional investors are taking a break from bitcoin in this unstable period with growing fear related to the coronavirus,"" according to an Arcane Research tweet.    Looking forward    With coronavirus showing no signs of a slowdown, stocks may continue to lose altitude, possibly keeping bitcoin under pressure.      Rumors are doing the rounds that the U.S. Federal Reserve may deliver another emergency rate cut before the next week’s scheduled meeting to address the liquidity issue in the market.      However, rate cuts may fail to yield a sustainable bounce, as there is general consensus in the market that additional easing would not catalyze economic activity. The threat to global supply and demand is not caused by institutional systemic failures, but rather a global health pandemic.

42404191,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhWS9,1584007220,Australian Tax Office to Warn Investors Over Crypto Misreporting,"The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is set to issue warnings to hundreds of thousands of residents who may have traded cryptocurrencies.      As reported by news.com.au on Wednesday, up to 350,000 Australians will be contacted by the ATO in the coming weeks reminding them of their obligations when trading in digital assets like bitcoin (BTC).      Under Australian federal law, cryptocurrencies are considered a form of property and are thereby subject to the same regulations relating to capital gains tax.      The ATO will ask those that traded cryptocurrencies throughout the 2017–2018 financial year to review their tax forms and declare instances in which they bought, sold or traded digital assets to make it easier come tax time.      As proof of trades, records kept by individuals should include exchange records, digital keys and records of agents, as well as any legal or accounting costs associated with their trading activity. Further, the agency is asking individuals to keep a record of the Australian dollar exchange rate at the time of their transactions, as this might significantly impact earnings.      The tax office is utilizing its Data Matching Protocol for cryptocurrencies, which allows it to cross-check data it has on individuals with data provided by exchanges (dubbed crypto designated service providers) in an attempt to identify those who may have misreported on previous tax returns.      “Under this program we obtain cryptocurrency transaction data from currency exchanges on taxpayers who have bought and sold cryptocurrency,” an ATO spokesman said in the report.      The planned warnings come as other tax agencies around the world move to more closely monitor for tax evasion involving cryptocurrencies. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service last summer issued similar warning letters about misreporting income from trades, and released its first guidance on crypto tax for five years in October.

42404187,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhWOD,1584003600,Coronavirus Is a Catalyst for Work-From-Home Tech,"Leah Callon-Butler, a CoinDesk columnist, is the director of Emfarsis, a consulting firm focused on the role of technology in advancing economic development in Asia.      Call it panic-stricken or precautionary, the world is currently rejecting anything that lumps a bunch of humans in one spot. Events everywhere have been postponed or cancelled altogether, business trips have been put off, employees told to work from home and we’re HODLing toilet paper as though we’re about to be quarantined for months.      Some believe the apocalypse is upon us, while others (as per this recent McAfee-ism) think it’s all an elaborate hoax. Either way, unless you’ve been hiding in a coronavirus-proof vacuum, you’ll be aware the economy is taking a massive hit right now. And not everyone will be able to roll with these punches. If you’re in an industry that relies on events or travel or people or places, things are looking pretty grim. But if you can adapt, you must.      See also: How to Survive the Coronavirus and Keep Your Startup Alive      In Asia, where I’m based, Singapore’s crypto industry association, ACCESS, was forced to change tack in February, when the government raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level from yellow to orange (red is the worst). While the Ministry of Health was urging organizers of large-scale events to cancel or defer, ACCESS and the Singapore FinTech Association were nearly done finalizing plans to run a workshop with the Monetary Authority of Singapore, which would help almost 300 participants come to terms with the new Payment Services Act.      With regulatory deadlines hanging over their heads, and an urgent need to begin issuing new operating licenses, the workshop couldn’t wait. So ACCESS Chairman Anson Zeall suggested they shift the whole thing onto the cloud-based video conferencing app Zoom. Of course, there was some anxiety about whether the platform could handle such a big crowd, but they pulled it off without a hitch and received rave reviews from attendees, including the Ledger sales team.      Zeall said it doesn’t matter if people liked the online mode of delivery or not. “We were forced to do it,” he said. “This is the new reality.”    The SARS epidemic of 2002 to 2003 fueled the rise and rise of the Chinese internet economy.    While WFH (yes, “Work From Home” now has its own acronym) may have finally found its way into mainstream corporate culture, nothing about the movement is particularly novel. The way we connect, communicate and collaborate has been evolving for a long time and much of the crypto crew already resides within virtual worlds. We feel right at home chatting with complete strangers via an online forum, our teams are distributed across time zones and territories, and messaging services – such as WhatsApp, WeChat, Telegram, Discord, Signal and Slack – have become the proverbial water coolers by which much of the community hangs.      The retreat to Zoom is an intensification of existing social phenomena, as WFH tech moves to acquire a greater share of our working day. While online collaboration tools hoover up new users as fast as (ahem) the spread of a virus, these so-called stay-at-home stocks have emerged as some of the few that can call themselves beneficiaries of COVID-19. On March 5, Zoom hit an all-time-high of $125 (up from $68 at the start of January), making it one of the best performing stocks of the year.      This might trigger a sense of deja vu if you can recall how the SARS epidemic of 2002 to 2003 fueled the rise and rise of the Chinese internet economy. With streets and shopping malls eerily empty across the nation, and millions of Chinese stuck at home with a brand-spanking-new broadband connection, just recently installed, people began to go online instead. And they did it in droves, accelerating user adoption of mobile and internet technologies exponentially.      See also: The Markets Were Already Vulnerable, Then Came Coronavirus      Some notably enterprising companies even adapted their business models and developed products in response to the changing conditions. It was during SARS that a fledgling e-commerce business named Alibaba made the strategic decision to move from a business-to-business model to a consumer-focused one, when it saw how many everyday people were connecting from home and learning to surf the web. In 2003, post-SARS, Alibaba rolled out the online shopping website Taobao. Today, China is the world-leader in e-commerce, and Taobao is its biggest e-commerce site, with 711 million annual active retail users.      The Taobao story demonstrates how a global health crisis could be a powerful catalyst to accelerate change. Human behavior is notoriously sticky, and in general we hate change. But we can also be extremely resourceful, and when left with no other options we tend to find new ways to get by. Sometimes we even like the new approach better. And before you know it, we’re wondering how we ever did it any other way.      As for the current situation, it’s possible we are being coerced into a new era of productivity, where we will finally leverage digital collaboration tools to their full potential and flexible work will be the standard, not the exception. We’ll develop new methods of virtual networking and rapport building, while rethinking how we measure the value and necessity of physical human interaction. We’ll lower the barriers to participation as we transcend traditional boundaries of time zone, location and cost. The reduction in flight miles won't be bad for sustainability either.      Not everyone will make it through, but crypto orgs might have a better chance than most.

42404177,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhWGL,1584000600,French Financial Regulator Suggests Europewide Security Token Sandbox,"France’s Financial Markets Authority (AMF) has proposed that all of Europe adopt a regulatory ""sandbox"" to support the emerging security token industry.      The “Digital Lab” would run for three years, the watchdog said in a March 6 legal analysis, exempting projects from financial regulations such as the MiFID and CSDR that AMF’s analysis deemed incompatible with the blockchain sector’s growth.      The proposal is from Europe’s most reliably pro-blockchain financial regulators. AMF has consistently advocated a forward-thinking approach to blockchain and distributed ledger technology for years, approving initial coin offerings, drafting blockchain bills and releasing experimental frameworks for crypto firms to regulate themselves.      “These frameworks were designed to frame centralized market infrastructures,'' AMF President Robert Ophèle said in a speech. He explained that “they are not suited to the decentralized nature of the blockchain environment” and therefore render many projects almost unprofitable.      But Ophèle insisted Europe could not just adopt new regulations for blockchain and security tokens overnight.      “We are faced with a ‘chicken and egg’ paradox,” Ophèle said. The space cannot develop under the current framework, but without documentation new frameworks cannot evolve either.      A Digital Lab sandbox would give regulators both, Ophèle said. Authorities would closely monitor how these projects evolve when unshackled from Europe’s traditional markets regulation, collecting three years of feedback and data to shape the formation of new, more flexible regulations.      “As a regulatory authority, we need to understand these changes and ensure that our regulatory frameworks remain appropriate. These frameworks must make it possible to manage risks – to effectively protect users – without losing the benefit of innovations,” Ophèle said.      It remains to be seen how other continental financial regulators will react to AMF’s latest recommendation. The press offices for Germany’s, Italy’s, Austria’s, Ireland’s and Finland’s respective securities regulators did not immediately respond to requests for comment, and neither did the European Securities and Markets Authority, the top securities watchdog for the European Union.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/03/12/french-financial-regulator-suggests-europewide-security-token-sandbox,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7f4462337943a1b8eca92385ef5ae8d95ab258be-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404173,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhWCP,1583985600,US Court Fines ICOBox $16M for Securities Violation in SEC Case,"A federal court has ordered ICOBox to pay a $16 million penalty to the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) for violating U.S. securities law.      On March 5, Judge Dale S. Fischer of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California granted the SEC's motion for default judgment against the ICO-as-a-service platform and founder and CEO Nikolay Evdokimov.      The SEC first brought charges against ICOBox in September 2019, accusing the company of hosting an unregistered securities sale. The regulator also accused the company of acting as an unlicensed securities broker for more than 30 token sales.      Raising $14.6 million from more than 2,000 unaccredited investors in its 2017 initial coin offering, Evdokimov had claimed during the sale that ""ICO"" tokens would rise in value as companies started using the platform.      As part of the judgment, ICOBox will be fined $16 million and Evdokimov will have to pay a personal penalty of more than $192,000.      Default judgments are usually granted in favor of a plaintiff when a defendant has not responded to a summons or has failed to appear before the court.

42404154,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhUGN,1583978404,Bitcoiners Are Biohacking a DIY Coronavirus Vaccine,"Anonymous bitcoiners are taking the search for a coronavirus vaccine into their own hands – bypassing academia, pharmaceutical companies and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).      The “biohacking” effort by a group known as CoroHope is crowdsourcing bitcoin (BTC) donations to fund its work. The group claims it has a biologist on board with 10 years' experience building similar vaccines for the FDA. Prominent community members such as Blockstream co-founder Mark Friedenbach are vouching for the unknown team. (“It is not a scam,” he tweeted.)      And it’s drawing on bitcoin’s decentralized ethos for inspiration.      ""Cryptocurrency is uniquely able to help with this problem because, like us, it's outside the traditional system. The original backers are bitcoiners, and we'd love to keep working with bitcoin and bitcoin developers on this problem. We need all the help we can get,"" a CoroHope spokesperson told CoinDesk by email.      The group sees the FDA as a potential hindrance to finding a vaccine for the rapidly spreading coronavirus because the agency has a stringent approval process that, to the biohackers’ minds, doesn't necessarily benefit the public.      See also: Chinese Crypto and Blockchain Firms Grapple With Coronavirus Outbreak      ""FDA-compliant manufacturing is absurdly overregulated: paperwork for the paperwork, quadruple-checking, endless committees … just the worst of bureaucracy. So we can be more nimble,"" the spokesperson said.      They noted that it took the World Health Organization (WHO) until Wednesday to declare the coronavirus a pandemic, “which will end up having cost thousands of lives due to continued complacency around the world. Unfortunately, COVID-19 is a global pandemic and frankly we're not interested in waiting for regulations to try to do good work.""      Like other bitcoin-adjacent endeavors (3D-printed guns, online black markets), this one is likely to be controversial.    FDA-compliant manufacturing is absurdly overregulated … just the worst of bureaucracy. So we can be more nimble.    ""I have no concerns with someone trying to develop something in a novel way. Science is all about that,"" said Nancy E. Kass, a professor of bioethics and public health at John Hopkins University.      ""But it would be harmful, problematic, confusing and misleading to start saying that they havean effective vaccine if that vaccine has not undergone proper safety testing and efficacy testing,"" she said, pointing to FDA rules as a guideline.      The CoroHope spokesperson agreed with this sentiment. ""We are not some televangelist hawking colloidal silver as a cure-all,” they said. “Even if we have thousands of reports of safe administration of our vaccine ... and reports of vaccines tongue-kissing an infected person without incident, we will not declare it an effective vaccine. That is indeed the domain of the FDA, and we do not aim to undermine public trust in the FDA.""      Reached for comment, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) told CoinDesk to contact the National Institutes of Health, which said it had received too many requests to respond. The FDA did not answer a request for comment.    Liability is the very reason its members have chosen to not reveal their identities, at least not yet.  Liability    Since CoroHope is using new means to develop a vaccine, the team is taking a risk. Bryan Bishop, a contributor to Bitcoin Core (the most popular bitcoin full node software), joined the biohacking project “to organize development” – only to quit a couple days later.      ""There's just too much liability,"" he said, if the drug has adverse effects on patients who end up using it.      Bishop pointed to a recent New York Times op-ed spelling out some of the perceived issues with health care liability in this day and age, where neither the FDA nor pharmaceutical companies want to be on the hook for things going wrong.      See also: New York Crypto Companies Move to 'Work From Home' in Face of Rising COVID-19 Threat      The CoroHope spokesperson said liability is the very reason its members have chosen to not reveal their identities, at least not yet.      ""Anonymity is preferable at this stage, as Bryan's concerns about liability are shared by the rest of the group,"" the spokesperson said.      For the same reason, the team is hesitant to reveal some details of the project.      ""Whether we have medical personnel, we can not and must not say. We are actively inviting anyone with relevant expertise to join our project, and we encourage them to invest in privacy while doing so, to maximize everyone's safety working on this endeavor,"" the spokesperson added.      See also: Ben Hunt on Markets and Narratives in the Age of Coronavirus      CoroHope has received “only a small amount of bitcoin so far,” according to the spokesperson. It’s published an address that as of press time had seen no transactions.      But the group is encouraging donors to get in touch directly to get an individual bitcoin address “because of the privacy-sensitive nature of this endeavor.” (Using fresh addresses for each transaction is considered a privacy best practice because it’s harder for busybodies to trace the flow of funds on the public blockchain.)    No guarantees    While the coronavirus is spreading rapidly, it's unclear how long it will take for CoroHope to come up with a concoction – or if it will even work.      ""This is not a cure​,” CoroHope warns in a document explaining its plans. “Untested vaccines are probably ineffective and come with no guarantees. This is true whether they are developed by a government, a large corporation or a collective of biohackers, just like any other medication. Our highest priority is to ensure that any vaccine we develop is not harmful, and its potential effectiveness is secondary to its safety,""      That sobering disclaimer was added out of “an abundance of caution – underpromise and overdeliver,” said the CoroHope spokesperson.      ""Any vaccine like this only has a small chance of working (perhaps 20 percent for [biotech company] Inovio's vaccine, and less for ours as we don't have millions of dollars for optimization),” the spokesperson went on. “When doing the cost-benefit analysis, though, even a tiny chance of it working will be worth the investment.”      See also: How to Survive the Coronavirus and Keep Your Startup Alive      Other biohackers share this desire to circumvent problems with traditional systems. For example, anarchist and transgender biohackers have been working to produce DIY estrogen and insulin, to avoid a medical system that is often unkind to them.      But while biohacking is a growing movement, biohacking a vaccine is quite novel.      ""To our knowledge, no one has yet biohacked a vaccine,"" the CoroHope spokesperson said.      A pioneering approach might make more sense with such a uniquely deadly virus, the spokesperson argued.      ""COVID-19 is the most dangerous virus since 1918 (though not surpassing that), and certainly since biohacking became a thing,” they said.    Plasmid vaccine    CoroHope does, however, have a plan.      Specifically, it is attempting to create a so-called plasmid vaccine, inspired by what Inovio Pharmaceuticals is working on. After successful trials, that publicly traded, Pennsylvania-based company said it will be ready for human trials in April.      The small CoroHope team has one person in an experimental “wet” lab, with another ""standing by"" if it receives enough crowdsourced donations, as well as a few people on the ""non-biology side.""      Ultimately, the group plans to put into the public domain any DNA sequences and hardware it develops so anyone can inspect, modify or use them, much like open-source software.      See also: Crypto Firms Tout Dispersed Workforce as Coronavirus Contingency Plan      ""Our biologist has manufactured plasmid DNA vaccines at the multi-gram scale for clinical trials,” the CoroHope spokesperson said. “Without too much detail, it was for a government agency, at a contract manufacturer. They have also manufactured biomolecules for over a decade and the experience is all relevant. Any molecular biologist has made plasmids with a kit, but doing it at industrial scale does require specialized knowledge that we possess.”      With initial funding, CoroHope’s first goal is to develop the plasmid DNA vaccine ""to design and synthesize the plasmid, perform preliminary testing and send it out to interested labs.""      If the group receives more funding, ""we can begin its production, scale-up and distribution,"" according to the document. But there are limits to what the group thinks it'll be able to do.      See also: Is Blockchain the Shot in the Arm Healthcare Needs?      ""While we will be performing quality control testing to ensure that the vaccine is safe, we will be unable to test it in a clinical trial or animal models, and would leave that part of the process to be hashed out by the community,” the document says.      This could be useful since even if Inovio's or another vaccine is approved soon, manufacturing enough doses for everyone ""is going to take some time,"" the spokesperson said.      ""If someone is at the bottom of the list, they have a right to take their well-being into their own hands. Our end goal is to make our vaccine available to anyone in that situation who understands the risks involved.""",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/12/bitcoiners-are-biohacking-a-diy-coronavirus-vaccine,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/41d32ab55f20212c965d649f4a705a80f64f6a85-1200x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
