42387569,18tZcBceb7lzdS5vgOGCC0,1641771200,"First Mover Asia: Bitcoin, Altcoins Rebound Amid Light Trading","Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Bitcoin led crypto’s small recovery from last week’s sell-off, but spot volume remained thin over the weekend.  Technician’s take: BTC upside is limited as long-term technical indicators turned negative.  Catch the latest episodes ofCoinDesk TVfor insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $41,845 +0.1%  Ether (ETH): $3,154 +2.0%  Markets  S&P 500: $4,677 -0.4%  DJIA: $36,231 -0.01%  Nasdaq: $14.935 -0.9%  Gold: $1,796 +0.2%  Market moves  Bitcoin pushed past the $42,000 level over the weekend after last week’s broad market bloodbath, which sent the No. 1 cryptocurrency by market capitalization spiraling toward $40,000 from about $48,000. At the time of publication, ether and most of the altcoins in CoinDesk’s top 20 by market capitalization were up, although still way down over the past week.  Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies fell last week amid the Federal Reserve’s release of minutes from its December meeting. The Fed signaled that it would tighten monetary policy faster than was once expected.  The leading cryptocurrency fell to as low as $40,505.30 on Coinbase on Saturday, its lowest level since Sept. 21, before it rebounded above $42,000, data from TradingView and Coinbase show.  But as markets in Asia open, it remains uncertain whether the recovery will last since bitcoin’s spot trading volume across major centralized exchanges on Sunday was thin, according to data compiled by CoinDesk. (At the time of publication, bitcoin’s price had sunk below $41,900.)  Bitcoin fell for six straight days before the weekend and the downward move escalated after the Fed minutes showed that policymakers discussed aggressive interest rate hikes and a faster pace to normalize its balance sheet.  “The minutes confirmed a strong hawkish bias with markets now pricing in a 90% chance of a Fed [rate] hike in March,” Singapore-based crypto quant trading firm QCP Capital wrote in its Telegram channel on Sunday. “... In the bigger picture, it seems likely that the all-time highs in BTC and ETH will remain capped for most of 2022 as a result of central bank tightening.”  Technician’s take  Bitcoin Oversold Within Downtrend; Resistance at $45K  Bitcoin (BTC) remains in a two-month downtrend defined by a series of lower price highs.  The cryptocurrency was down about 9% over the past week as upside momentum continued to slow.  There is minor support around $40,000, which could stabilize the current pullback. However, upside appears limited around the $45,000 resistance level. This means buyers could quickly take profits if a price bounce occurs.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is the most oversold since Dec.11, albeit within a price downtrend.  Over the long term, BTC is vulnerable to further selling, especially if buyers fail to hold the $38,000-$40,000 support zone over the weekend. On the weekly chart, the RSI is not yet oversold, which suggests the downtrend remains intact.  Lower support is around $28,000, which is near the June 2021 low.  BTC is roughly two weeks away from registering a downside exhaustion signal, which typically precedes a countertrend price bounce. Still, similar oversold readings on the daily chart have been delayed as buyers remain on the sidelines.  Important events  Australia TD securities inflation (Dec.

Portals recreates a dense urban environment where users can explore buildings and interactive rooms.  “Binance.US is getting a space in Portals Downtown with a focus on delivering the latest news, charts, and events virtually,” Portals head of community and partnerships Chris Lund said in a Twitter message to CoinDesk.  Lund said FTX.US, the U.S. arm of crypto exchange FTX, will also build its own office in Portals.  Companies have been rushing headfirst into open metaverses such as The Sandbox and Decentraland, both of which are Ethereum-based. Portals seems to be an early favorite for capturing metaverse mania on the high-speed Solana blockchain.  Binance.US spokesperson Zachary Tindall said the virtual buildout is meant to be a gathering place for exchange users.  “We are creating a space in the metaverse for the Binance.US community to come together,” Tindall told CoinDesk in an email. “It’s the first of many steps we’re taking to be forward-looking as we build and reach our community in new environments.”  And Binance won’t be alone.  Solana projects Raydium, Magic Eden, Audius, Bonfida and others will also have a presence in the Portals metaverse, Lund said.

As of press time, bitcoin (BTC) was changing hands at around $42,100, up 2% over the past 24 hours, based on CoinDesk pricing. The cryptocurrency had been on the verge of a seven-day losing streak that would have been its longest since 2018, but the price turned around on Saturday, eking out a small gain, and has stayed on an upward trajectory since.  The price hadn’t fallen below $40,000 since September, and is well off its all-time high of nearly $69,000 reached in November, and so there had been speculation that a drop below $40,000 might spur a deeper retrenchment.  “If the market has based at these levels, we might get that short squeeze we’ve been waiting so patiently for,” Singapore-based crypto trading firm QCP Capital wrote Sunday on its Telegram channel.  January tends to be a seasonally weak month for bitcoin, but this year has been especially harsh, with the largest cryptocurrency by market cap still down 9% so far in 2022.  The market was roiled last week by the release of Federal Reserve minutes signaling that officials at the U.S. central bank were starting to discuss whether to take more aggressive steps to tackle an inflation rate now at its highest in almost four decades.  Many investors say bitcoin has benefited in recent years from the Fed’s ultra-loose, emergency monetary policy since the coronavirus hit the economy – including printing more than $4 trillion to bolster ailing traditional markets.

42411584,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOtOi,1641747000,2021: The Year of the Alts,"It’s tempting to say 2021 was the year bitcoin finally went mainstream and just leave it at that. However, there’s another story that can’t be understated: the spectacular rise of altcoins or “alts” – that is, cryptocurrencies that are neither bitcoin nor ether – thanks in part to the NFT boom.  As the CoinDesk 2021 Annual Crypto Review showed, Bitcoin’s year played out like something unimaginable even three or four years ago: A sovereign nation (El Salvador) adopted it as legal tender and there was an upgrade to make it more transaction-friendly. Bitcoin traded close to $69,000 in 2021, and its market cap broke above $1 trillion at one point.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  For reference, when CoinDesk began publishing in 2013, the total value of bitcoin was little more than $1 billion and each coin was trading around $120 or so.  A notable feature is the decline of bitcoin dominance – meaning its share of overall crypto market cap – last year, from 70.2% to 40.1%.  But that doesn’t necessarily mean bitcoin has lost its luster. It just means there’s a lot more going on in crypto than just bitcoin these days.  To be sure, bitcoin added $330 billion in value in 2021 to close out at $875.9 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  On the other hand, ether returned 426% to investors in 2021. Its year-end value was $438 billion, meaning the market essentially added even more value to ether – $355 billion – than it did to bitcoin.  Yet the big market value gains last year were in the combined capitalizations of all the other cryptocurrencies out there – the altcoins. Taken together, these thousands of cryptocurrencies closed 2021 valued at $934 billion, or 39.7% of the total market cap of the entire crypto complex. That year-end figure is a gain of $791 billion, or a 550% increase.  In other words, the market has decided that it likes bitcoin more than it did a year ago, but it really, really likes ether and the alts.  Drilling down a little bit and one can see the underlying theme of the alts was clearly the rise of the layer 1s, meaning the native tokens of smart contract platforms that compete with Ethereum.  BNB, the native token of Binance Smart Chain, went from $5 billion to $85 billion, Solana’s SOL exploded from $85 million to $55 billion, and Cardano’s ADA took off from $5.5 billion to $46 billion (though it was at $95 billion over the summer). To be sure, a dramatic rise was to be found in layer 2 protocols, too. Polygon, a supplemental network to Ethereum, saw its native token MATIC rise in value from just $91 million at the start of 2021 to $18 billion at year end.  Driving it all to a great degree is the exorbitant gas fees – the cost to conduct transactions on the blockchain – found in the Ethereum blockchain, according to George Kaloudis, research analyst at CoinDesk. He sees the potential to scale as the reason why Solana and Polygon in particular, gained so much last year.  “Gas fees were so high that it was difficult to carry out transactions on Ethereum. So, people started looking for cheaper alternatives,” which they found on Polygon and Solana, Kaloudis said on Thursday’s “First Mover” program on CoinDesk TV.  The demand for gas, in turn, came about because of the surge in interest in non-fungible tokens, limited-edition digital collectibles sold by artists and celebrities.  “A lot of the new use cases that are coming up are new layer 1 smart contract platforms. They’re trying to scale these layer 1s and make them cheaper and make them more affordable, make them more accessible. And really, that’s powering the NFT boom that we’ve seen the past year,” said Kaloudis. “A lot of people heard about Ethereum because of NFTs, not the other way around.”  Still, Kaloudis is most excited by the rise of the Lightning Network supplementing the Bitcoin blockchain. It allows for cheaper transactions using Bitcoin, which could ultimately make the currency more agreeable as a means of transaction. “That’s my favorite use case of the year,” he said.  The Lightning Network has grown to 3,300 BTC committed to it – double from June 2020 – thanks in part to El Salvador’s use of bitcoin as legal tender.  It remains to be seen if that will sway attention from the competition between Ethereum and other layer 1s when it comes to transactions.  Nonetheless, it makes for an amusing question – what if bitcoin becomes the altcoin of 2022?",POSITIVE,BTC | MATIC | SOL,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | MATIC | SOL,Lawrence Lewitinn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/09/2021-the-year-of-the-alts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1212b888b9adf05daa76ceae3d481510d4fbe09f-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Today, anyone has an opportunity to earn passive income on their crypto assets in just a few clicks, whether on a centralized exchange or DEX. Over the past two years, centralized exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase have introduced staking to their users, compelling decentralized exchanges, or DEXs, to follow suit. At the height of the DeFi boom in 2021, over $110 billion in value was locked on decentralized platforms as staking became one of the most lucrative ways to earn passive income and relish returns on investment. On January 3, 2022, Ethereum 2.0 crossed the $34 billion mark in total value staked, showing a possible continuation of the explosive growth this year. Despite the growth, many platforms only offered staking rewards as the only viable passive income strategy for their users. One DEX, Hashbon, aims to change this by adding a reward system that complements staking with them - the staking referral program. Hashbon, one of the first cross-chain DEXs, announced the launch of their own staking program, &apos;Hashbon Rocket&apos;, last December to give HASH holders an opportunity to earn the highest possible APY and APR among all the available staking opportunities.
