42376914,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6l429,1392937433,Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF Revisions Reflect Consumer Protection Concerns,"Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss submitted a revised filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on 20th February for Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, the long-awaited bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) the investors first proposed in 2013.  The official submission, came just weeks after the Winklevosses revealed they were in dialogue with regulators about revising the proposal with the agency.  A filing for the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust was first submitted in July 2013.  Perhaps, most notable of the changes was the inclusion of Winklevoss Index - or Winkdex for short - into the document.The new blended bitcoin price index from Winklevosses' Math-based Asset Index LLC will be used to determine the value of the bitcoins in the ETF.  Previously, the price was to be based on ""a weighted average of the average of the high and low transaction prices"" on three major exchanges, Mt. Gox, Bitstamp and BTC-e.  Released on 19th February, the tool is designed to reflect what the investors believe to be the ""true price of bitcoins"". Notably, the brothers' legal counsel Kathleen H. Moriarty said this inclusion was not part of any SEC discussions.  Additional changes provided insight into the investors' discussions with the SEC, as well as the potential concerns of which they feel its investors will need to be properly notified.  SEC concerns  Though much of the altered language related to the inclusion of the Winkdex as the indicator of pricing for the ETF, there were wording changes that suggested the SEC was not initially satisfied with the consumer warnings included in the original filing or that it felt the public might need to be better informed about potential risks.  For example, new passages detailed how the ETF would be affected by large-scale attacks to the blockchain, the volatility of new bitcoin exchanges and the regulatory actions by foreign nations that may lead to the ""restriction of ownership, holding or trading in the Shares"".  Read one new line:  ""The temporary or permanent existence of forked Blockchains could adversely impact an investment in the Shares.""  Next steps  In spite of the revisions, however, Moriarty suggested the ETF won't necessarily be available for the general public soon.  Moriarty explained the situation to CoinDesk:  ""It's a back and forth between the issuer and the SEC ... It's very hard to predict when these things will come to bear. It drives issuers crazy that you can't predict it.""  Moriarty further indicated that the SEC has asked her not to comment on a timeline for the ETF publically. As recently as January, Moriarty had been outspoken on the issue, suggesting the ETF could be approved as soon as the end of 2014.

42376909,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6l3vr,1392930005,Bitstamp Restores Withdrawals Following Security Scare,"Bitstamp is in the process of restoring full services to all accounts following an issue that prompted the bitcoin exchange to disable withdrawals to some users.  The move was a security precaution and the affected accounts have been notified of the problem.  Nejc Kodrič, Bitstamp’s CEO, told CoinDesk that some accounts have already regained withdrawal functionality.  Phishing fears  The decision to halt the withdrawals was made after Bitstamp detected an increased number of phishing attempts over the last few days.  Bitstamp says some clients had reported receiving suspicious emails. The correspondences were examined and were found to contain malware, so Bitstamp then took the ‘better-safe-than-sorry’ approach and temporarily disabled the accounts.  At the time of writing, no Bitstamp user has reported any missing funds. It is possible that the attack was completely unsuccessful, although it is still too early to say with certainty.  Bitstamp believes the attack was targeted at bitcoin users only, and its sole intent was to steal bitcoins.  Warning message  In an email sent to affected clients, the Bitstamp team stressed that the tech team’s response to the phishing attack was a necessary precaution given the risks of the situation, and gave advice on how to deal with any malware.  “As a precaution we have also applied this security measure to your account,” the exchange wrote. “If you have received any emails with suspicious content and have opened links or attachments, we highly recommend that you immediately contact a computer expert.”  Even if you think your computer is clean, it is probably best to play it safe, Bitstamp says:  “If you consider that your system was not affected we kindly ask you to contact security@bitstamp.net to re-enable the withdrawal function on your account.""  The company added that the decision to disable withdrawals is an inconvenience, but it should be viewed as part of the exchange’s important security measures, which were put in place to safeguard users’ accounts – and their funds.  Attractive targets  The Mt. Gox debacle is still in the news, and other exchanges – including Bitstamp – have also faced related and unrelated problems in recent days.  Last week, Bitstamp was targeted by a massive DDoS attack, along with a few other exchanges. As with the current issue, it was forced to suspend processing bitcoin withdrawals, but it quickly recovered and resumed regular service.  On a more positive note, most exchanges appear to be very resilient to the frequent DDoS and targeted phishing attacks. It comes with the territory, it seems, and it is reassuring to see that most sites spring back to full service in a matter of hours.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/20/bitstamp-restores-withdrawals-following-security-scare,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3dcbec25da3b0ea86e0ebe9bfd6eb2422fcef6b3-1001x702.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376915,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6l43P,1392928457,"Thailand Flip Flops on Bitcoin, Suggests Exchanges are Still Illegal","Just days after reopening its bitcoin buying and selling services to the general public, Thailand-based bitcoin exchange Bitcoin Co Ltdhttps://bitcoin.co.th/en/ is once again being threatened by legal uncertainty.  Bitcoin Co Ltd reinstated its services on 15th February, after receiving a letter from its central bank that seemingly suggested it could legally do so.  However, representatives from the Bank of Thailand (BoT) have released new statements suggesting that Bitcoin Co Ltd ""interpreted the letter to serve its own interests"", and that it perhaps acted improperly by reinstating its services.  The legality of Thailand's bitcoin businesses has been in question now since last July 2013, when statements from the BoT in informal hearings caused the exchange to pause operations. The events caused widespread reports that Thailand had banned bitcoin to be issued around the globe.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Bitcoin Co Ltd managing director David Barnes said it has not been sent any messages by the BoT since receiving the letter in question. Further, he suggested he would hold off on taking any action until he received formal notice.  Said Barnes:  ""We plan to continue operations as normal.""  Legal dispute  The Bangkok Post indicated that the BoT official it spoke to believes bitcoin exchanges do not fall under Thai law, which would mean that Bitcoin Co Ltd is not eligible to receive the license it needs to conduct business.  The newspaper explained:  ""The letter also stated that even though the company allows its customers to trade bitcoins only for baht, it could not prevent customers from exchanging bitcoins for foreign currencies either locally or abroad.""  Given this interpretation, Bitcoin Co Ltd would be indirectly involved with foreign currency exchange under the Thailand Exchange Control Act of 1942, the paper said.  Still, such statements do not seem to reflect Bitcoin Co Ltd's updated guidance to its community.  Barnes contends that prior to reopening, Bitcoin Co Ltd revised its terms and conditions so that it and its users complied with BoT guidelines.  The updated terms and conditions readhttps://bitcoin.co.th/terms-and-conditions/:  ""The customer must agree never to exchange bitcoins purchased from Bitcoin Co Ltd for any currency other than Thai Baht. The customer must also guarantee that any bitcoins the customer sells to Bitcoin Co Ltd have never been involved in exchange with any currency other than Thai Baht.""  Community reaction  Frankie Bishop, a representative from the Facebook group Bitcoin Thailand, said that he is not surprised that bitcoin continues to operate amid legal uncertainty. Citing the expression 'this is Thailand', he said he believes trading will likely continue in spite of the new statements.  Bishop said that the BoT has effective implied that bitcoin ""does not fit anywhere"", under current Thai law, and that due to other pressing government matters, is unlikely to further clarify its position.  Explained Bishop:  ""Thus, we could conclude that this sits in that area called the 'Gray Area'.""

42376917,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6l45v,1392925013,Ben Lawsky Demonstrates 'Evolution' on Bitcoin Issues in Reddit AMA,"Ben Lawsky: Friend or Foe? It's a question CoinDesk recently posed regarding the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) superintendent, and one that is understandably concerning to the wider virtual currency community as New York state seeks to enact regulation in 2014.  Speculation aside, on 20th February, the bitcoin community got its chance to seek an answer when Lawsky participated in a much-anticipated Ask Me Anything session on reddit.    Here's my ""Proof"" picture for @reddit_AMA on #Bitcoin at 1230pm EST today. P.S. The SNES refs cracked us up. pic.twitter.com/6svPO3akNF      — Ben Lawsky (@BenLawsky) February 20, 2014    Starting at 17:30 GMT, Lawsky received more than 200 questions over the course of the more than hour-long session. Many attempted to glean more insight into the lawmaker's understanding of virtual currency, his views on how government should pursue financial regulation and his plans for bitcoin in New York.  True to his past demeanor, Lawsky was careful in his answers, letting ample pass time between responses and sprinkling his comments with lighthearted remarks. However, perhaps most notably, he was largely positive when speaking about bitcoin and its innovative technology.  Wrote Lawsky:  ""My hope is that if we can get appropriate guardrails in place to prevent money laundering, we can take a deep breath and really focus on trying to ensure that virtual currency firms flourish and continue to develop and innovate.""  Though the session was far from conclusive, the AMA gave Lawsky a platform to address major issues for the community, and provided more evidence to suggest that he intends to craft legislation that strikes a balance between the needs of law enforcement and bitcoin entrepreneurs.  Money laundering concerns remain  Echoing concerns mentioned in New York, community members were upfront about wanting to know more about the potential compliance burden Lawsky would look to put on state businesses. Likewise, Lawsky remained firm on this point, invoking terrorism when speaking about the importance of money laundering controls.  Despite this drawing of the lines, Lawsky did suggest a middle ground would likely be needed on this issue.  In particular, Lawsky said he would draw lessons from the US government's Dodd-Frank Act, which he faulted for putting an undue compliance onus on smaller banks.  Said Lawsky:  ""We've had some success in getting these regulations amended so they don't crush smaller community banks. Any regulations we issue for virtual currency firms will have to be carefully tailored with this in mind.""  Further, he stated that he wants to provide this clarity ""sooner rather than later"", acknowledging the difficulty today's entrepreneurs face from the current lack of legal clarity. For example, Lawsky noted that the state has not yet determined how to regulate bitcoin ATMs, despite their increasing presence nationally.  Improving Wall Street relations  Lawsky was also asked about his treatment of Wall Street, with some members of the community raising pointed questions about what they consider to be the imbalance with which New York has dealt with criminal actions from both camps.  Lawsky did no address these critiques, but did clarify that he believes regulation should help bring banks and virtual currency firms together. He said banks will become ""more comfortable with bitcoin-related activity over time"", but that its price volatility and criminal associations are likely deterrents now.  Further, he suggested that regulation should be viewed as a way to bring about better relations between both financial sectors, a point he stressed in two responses.  ""We do hope that regulation will create a level of certainty that could incentivize banks to promote not stifle these innovations.""  Concluding remarks  Reaction from the community seemed mostly positive, with even Bitcoin Financial Association member Bruce Fenton, a critic of New York's handling of January's hearings, acknowledging that the discussion was beneficial.  ""Mr. Lawsky seems to be taking less of a hard line than he has in the past, hopefully the feedback from investors and the community has been helpful,"" Fenton said.  Indeed, later in the session, Lawsky confirmed that his attitude toward virtual currencies had changed since the NYDFS hearings.  ""I've personally evolved a lot on the issue the more I have learned,"" he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TRADING,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/20/ben-lawsky-demonstrates-evolution-on-bitcoin-issues-in-reddit-ama,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/00eedf8b461e00a90ee60e1f2d840ff00d3fdec3-599x572.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376922,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6l4CD,1392919722,'Balanced' Integrates Bitcoin Payments for 450+ Online Marketplaces,"Balanced  , a San Francisco-based company that provides a payment API for online marketplaces has today announced plans to integrate bitcoin into its system.  The company's co-founder and CEO Matin Tamizi told CoinDesk that its marketplaces will benefit, as Balanced takes the payments layer off their hands:  ""We create value by having one API and one platform to do that.”  The payment API has begun trialling bitcoin integration with two of its customers: CrowdTilt and Gittip.  Lower fees  Tamizi confirms that the company has partnered with Coinbase to launch the effort. He added: ""There's a 1% fee. We're just passing on that 1% fee to the marketplaces.""  In effect, Balanced is passing on the 1% fee Coinbase levies to its customers in order to promote bitcoin over credit card transactions, as card fees are much higher. The Balanced website lists these fees at 2.9%+$.30 per transaction.  In turn, the company can offer marketplace customers a good introductory experience with bitcoin. “Coinbase makes it easy for anybody to start using and transacting with bitcoin instantly,” said Adam White, director of business development at Coinbase.  Bitcoin and digital payments  “What we’re trying to do is make it more mainstream by making the experience to purchase with bitcoin as close to established behaviour right now,” said Tamizi.  He believes that QR codes or long bitcoin addresses won’t be the future. Instead, Tamizi thinks something similar to Facebook Connect could be very successful for digital payments.  “You could use Coinbase, or perhaps another wallet in the future as well, to give us OAuth [open standard for authorization] access,” he said.  “You’re not sharing any sensitive information. Just like with Facebook Connect, you can revoke that permission.”  Future prospects  Balanced is only allowing marketplaces to accept bitcoin for now. However, with its escrow funds and payouts capability, there may be more bitcoin features at some point in the future. Tamizi said:  ""We have to learn more about the ramifications of paying someone using just a bitcoin address.""  To begin with, the company is experimenting with debit card payouts as an alternative to bank wires, which can be pricey. “The main way that we pay people out is ACH transfers. The other thing we’ve talk about recently is pushing money via debit cards.”  This method uses a person’s debit card number to send money to a bank account – a cheaper option for Balanced than ACH wires. That feature is expected to be available for a limited beta in May.  So, for now Balanced is focused on the payment side of bitcoin. “The bigger need we see more with our customers is being able to accept bitcoin as opposed to just being able to send it out,” Tamizi said.  “But maybe being able to send bitcoin out will help us expand internationally. There’s a lot of potential there. So we’ll see.”  About Balanced  The company describes itself as ""Processing. Escrow. Payouts. One API."" for marketplaces and crowdfunding sites. Last year it received $2m in a seed round led by Andreessen Horowitz. Currently, it has over 450 website customers.  “I think of bitcoin more of a currency similar to how US dollar of the Euro than an actual payments method. Bitcoin wallets are the actual payment method. So in this case we are giving you the ability to pay from your Coinbase bitcoin wallet.”  Tamizi added that his company still needs to learn the nuances of the relatively new currency. Its initial foray with the Coinbase partnership should be interesting given how nascent it still is for payments.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/20/balanced-integrates-bitcoin-payments-for-450-online-marketplaces,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9eba11cb2ff9735b995a8fea3b437fb179ba380d-2395x1037.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376916,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6l44f,1392915652,Italian Money Transfer Law Threatens Bitcoin Businesses,"Update 17:00 GMT: Responding to pressure, Italy has announced it will delay the law's implementation until July, 2014. It was previously enacted retroactively.  When Italy announced last week that it would implement a 20% withholding tax on all inbound wire transfers to domestic personal bank accounts, some members of the global bitcoin community suggested the country could embrace bitcoin as a means to avoid payment.  However, despite the optimism that bitcoin would not be affected by the move, which was aimed at cutting down on money laundering and tax evasion, representatives of Italy’s bitcoin community say the tax is actually likely to have a negative impact on bitcoin business and trade.  Franco Cimatti, a local bitcoin activist and organiser, explained that withdrawals from bitcoin exchanges would be affected by the tax, and suggested that legitimate businesses would be the most harmed.  Cimatti said the law is not good for those for moving large amounts of money around or opening legitimate businesses using bitcoin technology.  Italian newspaper Il Sole reported that the 20% tax will be applied to all transfers to individual domestic bank accounts from abroad, starting 1st February, unless the recipient can prove that the money is not income. All eligible transactions need to be reported to the government and those affected have one year to pay the appropriate tax.  Notably, business accounts are not affected by the new rule. Personal exceptions to the law include the return of a previous loan or the return of a deposit.  Widespread confusion  Despite those facts, however, members of Italy’s bitcoin community stress that many questions about the new law cannot yet be answered.  “There are still doubts about how this new law works, even in the banks,” said Cimatti.  For instance, he said it is unclear if SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) transfers are subject to taxation, and if so, whether such action would be lawful.  Furthermore, Francesco Cittadini, a consultant who represents local bitcoin entrepreneurs, suggested that the higher authorities could eventually block the law.  Cimatti agreed, saying:  “The European Commission has placed this measure under investigation [and] is considering the compatibility of this measure with the principles of free movement of goods and capital.”  Impact on exchanges  Though the full impact of the law is not yet known, members of Italy’s bitcoin community said the regulation would likely impact the withdrawal of funds from major bitcoin exchanges, most of which are located outside the country.  Notably, the reporting burdens implemented by the new tax would fall on the consumer, not the exchanges.  “The taxpayer must provide all necessary information to identify the possible nature of the income flow, as well as [...] its tax base. In the absence of such information, the withholding tax must be applied to the whole amount of [the] payment,"" Cittadini said.  Cimatti suggested that, under the new law, private bitcoin users who wanted to withdraw fiat funds would be best served by so-called over-the-counter (OTC) solutions such as LocalBitcoins.com.  “If [SEPA transfers are taxable], then it’s good for all Localbitcoins and private users,” Cimatti said.  Burden of proof  Marco Barulli, co-founder of the Italy-based password management company Clipperz, suggested that avoiding the tax would be onerous for bitcoin users. He said:  “I asked my financial consultant [Cittadini], who said that, to avoid the 20% tax, you should prove the payment is [neither] a ‘compensation’ [nor] money subject to capital gain taxes. This will probably require documentation about the history of deposits and transactions on the BTC exchange.”  Cittadini, later provided clarity on how this process would work:  “The taxpayer can attest [...] that [payments] do not constitute capital gains or other income arising from investments abroad or foreign activities of a financial nature.”  Possible solutions  For now, Cittadini suggests that Italian bitcoin users abide by the new regulation until its impact is clarified.  “My advice is to operate within the law, working with your own Italian financial intermediary, to provide any relevant information that lets you avoid the withholding tax.”  However, founder and CEO of Italy-based bitcoin exchange BitBoat, Thomas Bertani, indicated that foreign bank accounts were already becoming the preferred option for the country’s bitcoin users:  “The easy way out for bitcoiners, and this is what they are actually doing, is to open a bank account outside the country, so that they are not affected.”  Bertani further suggested that Italians could use prepaid cards to transition the funds to fiat, although such a step would undoubtedly add another level of hassle to the withdrawal process.

The company started accepting bitcoins last month, so it is perhaps no surprise that it is trying to drum up some trade.  The ‘PC Parts Week’ discount applies to bitcoin orders over $100. Users fitting the requirements will get $20 off their order.  The deal is sponsored by chip-makers Intel and AMD, memory outfits SanDisk and Kingston, add-in-board partner PNY, and TRENDnet.  The offer went live yesterday, February 19th, and it will remain valid through to February 26th. It is limited to one offer per customer and the discount will be applied at checkout.  Although $20 may not sound like much, that much off a $100 purchase equates to a 20% discount.  Growing choice  TigerDirect  , which is based in Florida, started accepting bitcoin payments on January 23 and so far the most popular product categories for buyers using the virtual currency have been graphics cards, power supply units and tablet PCs.  Over in Britain, meanwhile, Scan Computers also recently started taking bitcoin via BitPay.  Scan executive James Gorbold said the company is also looking into other alternative currencies, such as litecoin. Scan is offers custom frames for GPU miners, so it only makes sense that it would consider scrypt-based altcoins for payments.  Like TigerDirect, Scan uses BitPay to handle payments.  Also hoping to rake in some virtual currency, Aria PC Technology, another UK component supplier and e-tailer, started accepting bitcoin just last week.

42376923,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6l4DT,1392903653,PayPal Likes Digital Currencies? Yawn,"It’s hard to not get frustrated when everyone starts jumping for joy after a televised interview in which eBay CEO John Donahue told Bloomberg that PayPal is building a digital wallet for multiple cryptocurrencies. Because, of course, it is. The e-payments giant would be silly not to.  Paypal  , which is owned by eBay, is the pioneer in digital payments and they already accept over 25 foreign currencies – basically, all of the ones that matter, with the exception of the Chinese RMB.  New digital currencies like bitcoin will likely interact with PayPal’s systems in the same manner as existing fiat currencies – when they are big enough. That's because, like Coinbase and BitPay, you would expect PayPal to lock-in fiat prices for merchants accepting bitcoin.  They would also be likely to batch transactions ‘off-block chain’ in order to cover transaction risks during the 10-minute confirmation window.  What they said  In the interview, Bloomberg’s Matt Miller told Donahue that he thinks digital payments like bitcoin will rule in the internet commerce of the future and have the potential to make PayPal defunct unless the company starts preparing now.  However, it is absurd to infer that PayPal is useless in the long-term, and neglects the fact that PayPal owns some serious e-commerce real-estate. This is like saying that Amazon, after utterly dominating the book industry, would never be able to move into electronics (or any other category that they have since dominated).  Miller speaks with an irritating certainty about bitcoin. It’s safe to call me a fanatic, but Miller is already in outer space on his way to the moon.  Finally, the idea of the “head start” PayPal would get for spinning off now makes some sense until you consider what he is really saying. This is, that PayPal should essentially spin-off to the highest bidder before it dies an inevitable death. Is Miller suggesting a perverse corporate pump and dump?  Donahue’s no fool. He coolly pointed out there's nothing that's holding PayPal back from integrating digital payments today as part of eBay, in fact:  “PayPal is pursuing digital payments and is the leading digital payments alternative in many different environments. So it’s not a matter of eBay holding PayPal back.”  What Donahue is really saying of course is: we will do with bitcoin what we want, when we want to, because we are really, really good at payments.  He doesn't need to utter the word ‘bitcoin’, because that particular currency would be lower volume for PayPal today than the Russian ruble. Miller is like a dog with a bone though: “Until everyone starts using bitcoin, and then there will be no reason to use PayPal.”  Then Donahue responded with the bombshell:  “[That is just what] PayPal is doing in building a wallet that can hold multiple types of digital currency.”  So, we can assume that, as soon as cryptocurrencies are actually worth PayPal’s time and regulatory uncertainties over the commercial use of cryptocurrencies are removed, the company will integrate them into their system. And will very likely be a force from day one.  It's really not a matter of if PayPal enters the bitcoin industry, but when and, more importantly, how.  Build or Buy?  PayPal has enormous resources at its disposal in terms of financial and human capital, but the company seems to have a much better option than building their own bitcoin products from the ground up – on the merchant side, at least.  If PayPal could acquire BitPay, it would be a great deal for both parties.  Not just because BitPay is the leading bitcoin payment processing company and that PayPal would gain all their expertise, while dotting the global map with locations that accept the virtual currency overnight.  Or because their joint DBA (‘doing business as’ title) is already flawless – what's not to like about BitPayPal?  But because BitPay’s business model would compliment, not cannibalize, existing PayPal sales.  A lot of people have the misconception that bitcoin will crush PayPal's margins. That’s not likely.  PayPal could drop their prices for bitcoin transactions overnight by a full percentage point and make the same gross margins, because the company wouldn't be exposed to the same interchange or credit card fees.  In addition, PayPal could become an instant bitcoin market maker.  Contrasting cultures  BitPay is really two businesses: a SaaS (software as a service) company that offers merchant services and a ‘long’ hedge fund that benefits from jumps in the price of bitcoin.  Multiple sources have told me the company sits on over 40,000 bitcoins. That's a lot of exposure to price swings, but it is also a valuable asset.  Ownership of BitPay would allow a company like PayPal to kill two birds with one stone via an acquisition: acquire the talent and IP and seamlessly acquire the necessary underlying currency.  Will this acquisition actually happen, though? Probably not. But the move would make a lot of sense for Paypal.  Ryan Galt is a blogger, entrepreneur and freelance opinion writer for CoinDesk.

(Japan) has moved to the address below"".  The address supplied is in the same neighborhood, but is possibly a virtual office space only. As yet, there has been no other indication the company has moved staff or equipment there.  The owner of Mt Gox's office building is said to be annoyed at the attention the company has been getting lately, especially with protestors near the front door and various images of the building appearing on the web. This is not surprising in real-estate conscious and superstitious Tokyo, where even the most premium office space can attract a bad reputation that sticks for years.  Another statementhttps://www.mtgox.com/img/pdf/20140220-Announcement.pdf  was issued by the company today, which read:    ""Thank you for your patience this week while we are working on re-initiating bitcoin withdrawals. In addition to the technical issue, this week we have experienced some security problems, and as a result we had to relocate MtGox to our previous ofﬁce building in Shibuya (details can be found here https://support.mtgox.com/home). The move, combined with some other security and technical challenges, pushed back our progress.      As much as we didn’t want to only provide an 'update on an update', this is the current status. We are committed to solving this issue and will provide more information as soon as possible to keep everyone in the loop.    We are very sorry for the delays and deeply appreciate your kind understanding and continuous support.""    Looking at the building's floor guide in reception, it has few tenants other than Mt. Gox and its parent company, Tibanne.  Protestors, their friends and reporters for various financial media were asked several times by staff and security to step off the building's premises, and stand only on the public street.  The attention began long before the current protest, with Wired sending a team there for the original unsuccessful doorstop interview attempt last November, and posting pictures of the building.  Also on the ground floor of Mt. Gox's Shibuya headquarters is the 'Bitcoin Cafe', which Wired reported to be a Mt. Gox project due to open in December last year. Since Wired's visit, some signage (covered) has been installed and several vans stopped to make deliveries during the day on Monday.  Price fall  The price on Mt. Gox last night and early this morning (GMT) hovered around $250 but started to decrease swiftly at around 06:45, falling to $135 by 08:00.  At the time of writing, the price on Gox is just under $150, while the CoinDesk BPI is much higher at $587.  The last time the price of bitcoin on Mt. Gox was this low was back in early October, shortly after black marketplace Silk Road was shut down.  What do you think will happen to the price of bitcoin on Mt. Gox over the next few days?

42425467,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyI2Onh,1392895690,Why Lightspeed Venture Partners Sees Bitcoin as a Good Investment,"Lightspeed Venture Partners is a venture capital firm with a global reach. Based in Menlo Park, California, the company also has people on the ground in India, Israel and China.  The firm has a keen interest in bitcoin, investing in BTC China, Ripple and startup incubator Boost, which launched a bitcoin accelerator class last year.  Seven bitcoin startups from this accelerator were accepted onto the Boost program last summer, including BitWall, Vaurum and Gliph.  Jeremy Liew is a partner with the firm. His first impression of bitcoin was positive, as he quickly realized the opportunities the young currency presented. He said:  “I first got into bitcoin through looking at Coinbase when they were raising money at the end of last year. It took me 24 hours to realize how revolutionary it was. It very quickly dominated my life after that.”  Keeping an open mind  Liew was present at the New York financial hearings last month. He testified in front of the members of the Department of Financial Services, stating that bitcoin is “moving in the direction of greater legitimacy”.  However, at this point, he’s still not quite sure what policies the US regulators are going to put in place. “It’s still not totally clear what they may do,” he says. “But we’re keeping an open mind, and we’ll see what happens.”  Whatever may happen, Liew stressed that Lightspeed VP is looking to fund startups that will comply with future regulation.  However, some bitcoin startups may not have so much regulatory exposure. Liew emphasised that his focus is on the business idea, which is the critical factor. Thus, some companies in the space may simply use bitcoin as a ‘pipe’ to move value around:  “If you are going to build a micropayments system for charity where you are just using bitcoin as transport, then it’s not clear to me you’re going to be heavily regulated.”  However, exchanges (as money transmitters) will need to follow all applicable policy: “Certainly, being an exchange, that would definitely be the case,” he said.  Down the road  It’s important to remember that, as an open-source project, bitcoin is a new and ever-evolving financial innovation. Lightspeed Venture Partners is watching closely as the protocol continues to grow and change: “I think that, as the number of people in the bitcoin ecosystem increases, the pressure to ‘fix bugs’ in the way bitcoin works increases.”  However, mainstream acceptance of bitcoin may require the currency to shift towards a more consumer-oriented focus, says Liew. The fact that a consensus has been developed in the past for changes is a good sign for the future:  “Just as bitcoin has made changes in the past, there will be more changes in the future that are adapted to solve the business problems.”  Alternative cryptocurrencies, such as litecoin, have some advantages over bitcoin – such as faster transactions.  Liew believes that the beneficial elements of other altcoins could be brought into bitcoin’s source code to help it improve. The way to look at it is: “what litecoin can do today, is what bitcoin can do in the future,” he said.  Payments problem  In Liew’s view, it still isn’t incredibly easy to pay with bitcoin as an individual. That remains a challenge to overcome.  However, there is potential in what he refers to as “remote payments”, digital transactions that don’t utilize a physical point of sale. “I think there is going to be more and more e-commerce, and [bitcoin] can be used for remote transactions – that’s an enormous opportunity.”  Liew pointed to Amazon as a company that doesn’t need to confirm a transaction right away. It takes time for Amazon to process and ship an order. Therefore, that company doesn’t need to wait for the blockchain to produce a record of sale instantaneously.  “It’s fine to have a little bit of time for confirmation of transactions [for online purchases],” he says.  How that will be done with personal payments is still problematic, as bitcoin processors are currently exposed to the risk of doing off-block chain transactions. The question is, will this continue as adoption increases?  Around the world  Lightspeed’s investment in BTC China was carried out through the firm’s Chinese subsidiary.  “Lightspeed China Partners, which led the investment in BTC China, is a separate fund that we spun out a couple years ago that is based in China,” said David Chen, another partner at the firm.  Recently, Lightspeed Venture Partners India published its 2014 predictions for bitcoin. The top declaration? That venture capital in bitcoin startups would hit $100m this year. “We work closely with the folks in India and Israel in various areas, including bitcoin,” said Chen.  In the United States, Liew singled out New York as a place where financial innovation will occur:  “There’s a lot of stuff going on in New York. It’s the financial capital of the world, so there’s a lot happening there.”  However, when pressed for comment on where the global hotspot for cryptocurrencies will be, Liew would not commit. He made it clear that bitcoin is a global instrument, and new ideas could come from pretty much anywhere.  That might explain his firm’s investment in BTC China and its search for new investments the world over.  “There’s going to be innovation in a whole bunch of places,” he said.

42425457,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyI2OPh,1392892303,Brazilian Central Bank Outlines Digital Currency Risks,"The Central Bank of Brazil (Banco Central do Brasil) has issued a digital currency warning, joining the central banks of India, China and many other large economies across the globe in outlining risks associated with digital currencies.  The Brazilian warning does not bring anything new to the table, it reads like similar statements issued by other national regulators over the past few months.  The bank points out that digital currencies should not be confused with electronic money, as defined by Brazilian legislation. Unlike digital currencies, electronic money is governed by various normative acts and it allows the users to make transactions denominated in domestic currency.  Digital currencies do not, and therefore they are not considered 'electronic money'.  No guarantees, no consensus  The Central Bank of Brazil points out that digital currencies and payment systems have been a subject of international debate for a while, but no concrete conclusions have been reached so far. It stated:  “Virtual coins are not issued or guaranteed by a monetary authority. Some are issued and brokered by non-financial entities and [others do] not even have a responsible authority for its issuance. In both cases, entities and persons who make or issue these virtual assets are not regulated or supervised by the monetary authorities of any country.”  The bank also pointed out that digital currency conversion cannot be guaranteed, as these currencies are not backed by tangible assets or traditional monetary authorities. The conversion value depends on the trust and confidence of those using the currency.  “There is therefore no government mechanism to guarantee the value of currency instruments known as virtual currencies,” the bank said. All the risk is in the hands of the users.  Volatility, illegal activities  Volatility is also mentioned as a serious concern. The low volume and limited acceptance of digital currencies can lead to substantial fluctuations, and the bank warns volatility could even lead to a “total loss” of value.  Another concern is that monetary authorities in different countries can use their power to introduce measures that can affect the prices of digital currencies, or take other actions that could hurt investors, or even inhibit trading. The bank warned:  “Moreover, these virtual instruments can be used in illegal activities, which may give rise to investigations conducted by public authorities. Thus, the user of these virtual assets, although acting in good faith, can become involved in these investigations.”  Lastly, digital currencies can be targeted by cyber criminals and stolen from digital wallets.  No threat to Brazil’s financial system  The Central Bank of Brazil concluded that digital currencies do not represent a risk to the national financial system, particularly in the retail payment space.  “The Central Bank Brazil is following the evolution of the use of such instruments and discussions in international forums on the subject - in particular about their nature, ownership and operation,” the bank said.  The organisation will keep track of international developments before it decides whether to adopt any measures within its mandate, provided they are applicable.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/20/brazilian-central-bank-outlines-digital-currency-risks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1ae7afc8862e208ff136b0e65ce2c8f7ca817975-1024x617.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425459,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyI2OVh,1392856132,Hungarian Bitcoiners See Silver Lining in Central Bank Warning,"The National Bank of Hungary issued a warning to its citizens about the potential dangers of virtual currencies on 19th February, calling the payment method ""much riskier"" than other electronic payment options such as credit cards.  The central bank cited bitcoin specifically in its statements, which it said were meant to ensure current and future users had the proper knowledge before investing.  Said the official release:  ""The Bank warns consumers to be extremely cautious.""  The National Bank of Hungary did acknowledge the benefits of virtual currencies, nodding to their anonymity, speed and ability to cut out intermediary financial institutions, though it went on to say that these strengths also posed ""significant risks and problems"".  For example, the bank noted that its stock market regulations currently do not apply to bitcoin, and that ""no legislation"" protects virtual currency customers.  The statement marked the first time the National Bank of Hungary has commented on bitcoin publically, and despite the fear, uncertainty and doubt these kinds of announcements can spread, the country's virtual currency users are choosing to view the news as a positive.  A warm reception  Speaking to CoinDesk, president of our Hungarian Bitcoin Association David Pajor suggested the bank's statements merely echoed past releases from the European Central Bank (ECB), and that more importantly, the remarks were not extreme, like those issued from Russia before its ban.  Pajor explained:    ""The Hungarian Bitcoin Association is happy to have any authority say anything about bitcoin. The government, the tax authority, the national bank, everyone was silent about bitcoin.      So, first of all it's great to hear anything about how to treat virtual currencies. It's a great thing.""    Pajor was particularly pleased that the bank compared bitcoin to financial assets, suggesting that he believes it is a sign that bitcoin could gain legitimacy on similar grounds. In addition, he indicated that such statements, while seemingly negative now, could help lead to positive regulation down the road.  ""This is the first step I think,"" Pajor said.  Community impact  Tamas Blummer, founder and CEO of Bits of Proof, echoed Pajor's belief that the statements will help smooth relations between the local community and regulators. Blummer said that Hungary has an ""active community"" of bitcoin users, and that local startups are becoming increasingly interested in the technology.  ""There is quite a bit of buzz about bitcoin, unfortunately the legal environment is not yet clear,"" he said.  On the subject of regulation, Blummer was optimistic about the future in light of the statements as well.  Stated Blummer:  ""It's an opportunity for us to ask for more, because this at least shows that they have to say something about it.""  Recent warnings  Notably, the statements come just two days after Ukraine issued its first guidance on bitcoin, and roughly one week after Greece broke its silence on the subject.  The tone of the recent statements, many of which draw on past remarks from the ECB, increasingly suggest that decisions from the European Union will set the tone for further action in eastern Europe and Asia.
