42402740,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcc9R,1553805943,"$5 Million in MakerDAO Loans Have Been Liquidated, But Help Is on the Way","UPDATE: CDP Saver by Decenter is now live on ethereum mainnet. The blog post announcing its launch can be found herehttps://blog.decenter.com/2019/04/29/introducing-cdp-saver-cdp-management-and-protection/.    ____________    There's always a risk in taking out a loan, even more so when you make that loan on a blockchain.  That fact is perhaps no better understood than by those building the programmatic lending platform MakerDAO, which, having created the first widely used U.S.-dollar stablecoin on ethereum, the DAI token, is responsible for one of the most groundbreaking decentralized finance applications to date.  ""The success of Maker and DAI is not only a testament to the innovation happening within the ethereum community, but also to the flexibility and utility of the ethereum platform itself,"" said Brian Mosoff, CEO of Ether Capital, who announced an investment of $1 million in MakerDAO tokens two weeks ago.  Indeed, it's widely agreed DAI is becoming a needed source of financial predictability and liquidity in the ethereum economy.  ""It's much simpler to hold a stablecoin. It makes the budgeting totally predictable,"" explains Lane Rettig, independent core developer and volunteer project manager of ethereum.  But unlike most other dollar-backed stablecoins of its kind, the value of DAI doesn't actually come from the creators of MakerDAO, but rather users that leverage a feature called a ""Collateralized Debt Position"" (CDP).  Users that want to generate new DAI take out a loan by using their own ether as collateral. What's more, for the entire duration this amount of DAI is in circulation, it's up to the users – not MakerDAO – to ensure they have sufficient reserves to back its value until the DAI is returned and an accrued fee (currently 7.5 percent) is paid. Only then is the ether held in a CDP released back to a user.  It goes without saying that this comes with a considerable amount of risk to the user borrowing DAI, given that sudden drops in ether price may devalue collateral held within a CDP.  Should the value of any contract fall below the minimum collateralization ratio of 1.5 ETH to DAI, the MakerDAO system will forcibly liquidate a user's CDP and sell all staked ether automatically at a 3 percent discount to cover outstanding DAI debt – all this on top of a 13 percent liquidation penalty.  To date, software engineer for ethereum research and development startup Decenter Nenad Palinkasevic tells CoinDesk roughly 37,000 ETH – over $5 million – has been lost due to this liquidation penalty fee. In addition, Palinkasevic highlights that out of the 16,249 CDPs that have been created by users in total, roughly 14 percent or 2,278 CDP smart contracts have ended up forcibly liquidated to date.  An unfavorable outcome for users, there are a number of third-party applications currently being tested to take the risk out of CDP risk management. One of these applications live on ethereum test network Kovan and markets itself as the ""complete, one-stop solution for CDP management"" on Reddit.  Enter CDP Saver  Engineered by Decenter, CDP Saver is a web application envisioned to prevent CDPs from liquidation – automatically.  At present, users must keep a careful eye on the value of their ETH collateral being stored within a CDP. If the user thinks that their CDP will fall below the minimum collateralization ratio, they can either lock up more collateral to boost up the ratio or simply close the CDP and pay back the full amount of their loan in DAI.  But there's also a third way to save CDPs from liquidation, as explained by Palinkasevic. Rather than wiping the entirety of their debt, users can partially ""unwind"" their CDP through the CDP Saver.  The first step to unwinding a CDP is drawing an available surplus of ETH collateral and swapping it on a cryptocurrency exchange for DAI. Then, the newly converted DAI is used to repay a portion of owed CDP debt and thereby increase the collateralization ratio.  This whole process of unwinding, Palinkasevic explains, can be done in a single transaction. On the CDP Saver, this feature is called ""Repay."" Palinkasevic tells CoinDesk:  ""The Repay function works great because of two facts. CDPs are always overcollateralized and paying back debt increases your [collateralization] ratio more than locking up ether would.""  The CDP Saver also alternatively features a function called ""Boost"" to perform the exact reverse of repaying CDP debt. Using Boost, users would be able to initiate conversions of DAI into ETH and decrease their relative collateralization ratio.  At present, currency conversion on CDP Saver is carried out through a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange platform called Kyber Network. And while Palinkasevic insists a first version release of the application on ethereum mainnet is coming ""soon,"" he also admits that the first release of the platform will only allow users to Repay and Boost their CDPs manually.  ""In the second iteration of CDP Saver, we will releasee the automatic CDP saving feature,"" said Palinkasevic. In this iteration, Palinkasevic notes:  ""A user will authorize a [smart] contract to be able to do the Repay. The contract is predefined and audited to only be able to do a Repay if conditions are met. Then, bots will monitor the CDPs and their ratios and will trigger the transaction for Repay.”  Once a repay is triggered, users will be required to pay a small fee for leveraging the CDP Saver tool. Details about the exact fee amount is yet to be determined, according to Palinkasevic.  An emerging toolkit  To date, over 80 million DAI tokens have been liquidated, with one infamous CDP smart contract – CDP 3228 – being liquidated back in November 2018 for nearly 7 million DAI. At the time, this accounted for approximately 10 percent of the total DAI supply, according to MakerDAO community lead David Utrobin on Reddit.  Even so, new CDP contracts are being opened every day. Thus far, in 2019, over 6,000 new CDPs have been opened. To a growing user base of DAI holders, CDP management tools like the CDP Saver are just one of a myriad of third-party applications being built and released.  As highlighted by MakerDAO core community lead David Utrobin on a weekly community call, a new application called Keydonix has recently launched. It enables ""one-button"" closes of CDPs such that users who ""are close to being liquidated"" are able to pay back DAI debt more quickly.  Another application called InstaDApp is aimed at building a decentralized bank on top of the MakerDAO lending protocol. Co-founder of the platform Samyak Jain tells CoinDesk:  “Our main goal is to reduce complexity for the user on a smart contract and user interface, user experience level … For InstaDApp, we have our own smart contracts where we have reduced the complexity of the MakerDAO protocol for the user.”  InstaDApp currently hosts a webpage called MakerScan where users can track CDPs, receive automated alerts about their activity, bolster collateral to CDPs by donating ETH, among other functions. Jain adds that InstaDApp is also working to develop more complex alerting mechanisms similar to the ones being tested by CDP Saver.  “We are currently working on more complex alerts. So in the future, we’ll also provide whenever the [collateralization] ratio is above this then give the alert to deposit more ETH or pay some more DAI,” highlighted Jain.  A third application called the CDP Liquidator was initially created as a hackathon project. Similar in aim to Keydonix, one of the developers behind the CDP Liquidator David Terry explained the CDP Liquidator tool has ""never been launched on mainnet"" and still requires “significant work in polishing and auditing.""  But noting the fast development of other projects in the space, Terry tells CoinDesk:  “I am very happy to see others building this kind of tooling and hope to see even more similar services merging.”  Ethereum workers via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,ETH | DAI,ETH | EXCHANGE | KNC | MKR | DAI,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/03/28/5-million-in-makerdao-loans-have-been-liquidated-but-help-is-on-the-way,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f794a4c23e4d3abb1466887b7e553fa041234b48-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402742,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdccBP,1553796051,Fake Volume on Crypto Exchanges Isn't the Half of It,"Daniel Cawrey is CEO of Pactum Capital, a cryptocurrency investment firm focused on market making and liquidity. Formerly a CoinDesk Contributing Editor, he is author of the upcoming “Mastering Blockchain” book to be published by O’Reilly Media.      Recently, a report was produced by Bitwise Asset Management showing the existence of faked volumes in the bitcoin market – 95% of total volume according to its research. It’s hard to disagree with many of the facts in the report. Yet there are some items left out in this presentation to the SEC.  It’s hard to justify bitcoin is a mature asset and has a sophisticated market supporting it. And despite the fabricated volumes across crypto exchanges, this presentation makes a compelling argument there is maturity.  However, this market isn’t sophisticated and there are key issues the report simply does not address.  Problematic Exchanges Outside of the 95%  It cannot be disputed there are issues with exchanges reporting fake volumes. It’s hard to argue CoinMarketCap isn’t complicit in reporting false crypto volumes. However, more questions need to be asked about two exchanges listed in the Bitwise report as having ""Actual Volume.""  The report to the SEC lists Binance and Bitfinex as two of the 10 exchanges that have actual crypto volume…  ... but leaves out specific information from those two exchanges that have over 50 percent of “real” volume, like on this histogram slide.  The report states that Binance and Bitfinex comprise over 50 percent of the total bitcoin spot volume. Yet neither of these two exchanges have normal banking relationships like others in the report do.  Both exchanges have significant regulatory issues that make their inclusion in this presentation to SEC concerning. Binance, for example, was funded by an ICO, supported by a token that looks a lot like a security and has not been able to obtain standard banking partnerships. Bitfinex has had significant banking issues, losing several relationships – even suing Wells Fargo at one point.  Both of them also use Tether.  The Tether Problem  Tether is a blockchain-based “stablecoin” built on the Omni (formerly Mastercoin) protocol. It is designed, as specified in its white paper, to use something called “Proof of Reserves” backed by the US dollar, to be pegged to USD. This “Proof of Reserves” tenet is supposed to hold and verify the USD peg via regular audits.  Basically, each Tether is supposed to be backed by a dollar in a bank account somewhere. According to the report in the custody part of its presentation, audits in crypto should be easy to accomplish.  Problem is, there’s never been an audit completed for Tether.  Citing ""complexity,"" an auditing firm hired to verify Tether’s “Proof of Reserves” was terminated – it has never had an external auditor complete this process. And like Bitfinex, Tether has also had its share of banking problems. That shouldn’t be surprising – Bitfinex and Tether seem to be very closely interrelated.  In fact, even the report admits Tether isn’t a stablecoin at all.  That’s not what Tether is supposed to be. It’s supposed to be pegged to USD. And it is used by Bitfinex and Binance to avoid having to satisfy the actual banking and regulatory compliance work that entails.  The Blockchain Transparency Institute  To further support the report’s analysis, there is a reference to a group called the Blockchain Transparency Institute. Claiming “a common institutional understanding of the true nature of the real market,"" the report cites the Institute and its research in identifying 56 exchanges with fake volumes.  Interestingly, there’s very little transparency around who runs the Blockchain Transparency Institute. There’s no listing on its website of who is managing this group, who is on its board if it is a non-profit or details on the methodology of its research.  There’s isn’t even an About Us page.  A quick glance at the ""Partners"" page at the Institute's website reveals a fascinating detail: Bitwise Investments, author of the SEC report, is listed as an ""investor class supporter.""  Why didn't Bitwise disclose it has a pre-existing relationship with the Blockchain Transparency Institute in its report?  Other Questions to Ask  It should be applauded Bitwise put together this presentation.  Someone needed to comprehensively detail the amount of wash trading cryptocurrency exchanges are conducting. However, regulators should be asking some key questions:  1. Why is Binance referred to as one of the exchanges that makes up the so-called ""real market""?  All exchanges in the report are registered Money Services Business with FinCEN, except for Binance, which makes up by far the most – 40.47% of the total “actual” crypto volume traded.  Binance and Bitfinex alone make up 54.41% of “real” volume according to the presentation.  According to the Blockchain Transparency Institute, the exchanges with the least amount of faked volume are Binance and Bitfinex. Yet these exchanges lack normal banking relationships and are supported by an unregulated stablecoin  Credit is due to Bitwise, a company in the crypto space taking the time and effort to do this research to help regulators. However, the picture provided is incomplete.  Bitcoin is not a mature, stable market if two exchanges without banking – and supported by an un-auditable, unregulated stablecoin – comprise half the ""real"" cryptocurrency trading volume.  Half of the “actual” BTC volume in this report is done on exchanges with no banking relationships and not enough in the way of compliance. This shows there is still a lot of growth left in this market before bitcoin becomes mature. It will happen, and it will be to the benefit of everyone involved.  Yet it’s going to take time, and it’s going to require patience. Surely the regulators realize that by now.  Disclaimer: This article represents the views and opinions of the author.

The Sweden-based firm announced the news over Twitter on Wednesday, saying that customers can now pay for Airbnb gift cards in bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), dogecoin (DOGE) and dash (DASH).  However, currently, the Airbnb gift cards can only be redeemed by U.S. residents with a U.S.-based payment method, according to information on Bitrefill’s website. Further, Airbnb gift cards can only be applied for reservations less than 28 nights, the firm said, while customers can purchase the cards in U.S. dollar denominations of $25, $50, and $100.  Bitrefill, which also provides mobile credit top-ups in cryptocurrency, said that the Airbnb offering is a voucher product and that it will provide users with a voucher code and instructions on how to use it.  Last week, the company also announced cryptocurrency support for Netflix subscriptions, with the same five cryptos. It also offers cards for travel services, gaming, VOIP and more, depending on global location.  Bitrefill is also an early adopter of the still somewhat experimental lightning network. In January, Bitrefill told CoinDesk that it aims to make lightning bitcoin payments easy for users with its ""Thor"" service that allows people to give lightning channels to someone else with no setup on the recipient’s side.  The firm carried out a first real-world transaction test using lightning in December 2017, saying it topped-up a mobile phone almost instantly with zero fees.

42402728,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcbzb,1553783414,Swiss Watchdog Rules Crypto Miner's ICO 'Seriously Violated' Laws,"Switzerland's finance watchdog has found that the cryptocurrency mining firm Envion AG, which raised millions through an initial coin offering (ICO), held the sale illegally and “seriously violated” laws.  Announcing the news on Wednesday, the country’s Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) said that Envion unlawfully received public deposits worth over 90 million francs ($90.33 million) from at least 37,000 investors through its token offering early in 2018.  FINMA began investigating Envion in July 2018 for potentially breaking financial market rules. In Wednesday’s statement, the regulator concluded that Envion carried out the offering without the necessary banking license in place.  Envion issued EVN tokens to investors who made payments in U.S. dollars and cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether, and granted them a claim to repayment after 30 years, FINMA said.  This acceptance of public deposits and “bond-like” arrangement falls under the country’s Banking Act and thus requires a banking license, according to the watchdog.  Furthermore, the conditions under which Envion issued its tokens were not equal for all investors, FINMA added. Its prospectus also did not meet minimum statutory requirements and an internal audit unit was not set up as required by law.  It was reported last May that the firm’s CEO, Matthias Woestmann, had claimed that the founders generated extra EVN tokens as part of a money grab. The founders counterclaimed that Woestmann had seized control of the firm and breached his contract.  Envion has been forced to undergo liquidation proceedings by the Swiss Cantonal Court of Zug, which found ""organisational shortcomings."" FINMA said it would not be taking supervisory action against the firm as a result.  It is not yet clear if and how investors in the project might be able to claim back their funds. FINMA indicated it is not able to provide information on Envion's financial state, as the bankruptcy proceedings are controlled by the Bankruptcy Office of Zug.  FINMA said it will continue to take action against unlawful ICOs that ""violate or circumvent supervisory law.""

Revealing the news exclusively to CoinDesk on Thursday, the two firms said the solution is aimed to increase the movement of institutional money into digital assets.  By utilizing Ledger’s multi-signature cryptocurrency wallet management product Ledger Vault, Legacy Trust said it can now “securely and efficiently” custody clients' digital assets, such as bitcoin, and perhaps most notably, will also start offering custody of ethereum-based ERC-20 tokens.  Legacy Trust group CEO and founder Vincent Chok told CoinDesk:  “There is huge interest in ERC-20 custody services and it’s only growing bigger. Every STO [security token offering] that is planning to take place will need to have custody for ERC-20 tokens.”  “Since the beginning of 2019, we’ve basically received around five requests for ERC20 custody, per week,” he added.  According to Ledger Vault’s global head, Demetrios Skalkotos, the partnership will ensure investors have “total control and peace of mind that their assets are secure, while not sacrificing convenience.”  Ledger first revealed the development of Ledger Vault solution in January 2018, saying at the time that the product would be aimed at institutional investors such as banks and hedge funds.  With institutional investors increasingly eyeing the cryptocurrency sector, a number of traditional financial firms have been venturing into custody services lately to meet the growing demand for more secure storage.  Earlier this month, online banking and trading group Swissquote said it is launching a ""nuke-proof"" cryptocurrency custody service.

42402719,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcbth,1553778027,AlphaPoint Appeals to Institutions With Security Token Tech Upgrade,"Blockchain services firm AlphaPoint has upgraded its tech solution for security token offerings (STOs) in a bid to attract institutional clients.  Revealing the news exclusively to CoinDesk on Thursday, AlphaPoint said with its upgraded technology stack, financial institutions such as private equity, real estate firms and funds can issue asset-backed security tokens, thereby increasing liquidity in the market.  The firm further said that it is evolving its Asset Digitization software in a bid to help clients create, issue and trade tokenized securities in a “secure and private” manner.  AlphaPoint CEO Salil Donde said the “enterprise-grade"" software enables institutions to tokenize illiquid assets and trade such assets on an exchange or licensed platform.  Donde added:  “We are enabling our customers to forge ahead with institutional adoption of security tokens as a means to streamline issuance, reduce deal costs via smart contracts, and optimize deal execution with the flexibility of the immutable ledger provided by STOs.”  AlphaPoint also named two clients that are already using its technology solutions: Muirfield Investment Partners, a private equity real estate investment firm, and Laureate Digital Securities, a blockchain-based asset management firm.  Muirfield has been using AlphaPoint’s Regulated Asset-Backed Token (RABT) framework since last May, in an effort to offer its investors an easier way to participate in the property market. Laureate, on the other hand, has been utilizing AlphaPoint’s Asset Digitization solution since last November, to develop and manage security token offerings and token trading on the secondary market.  “Asset Digitization [helps Laureate] replace the laborious, paper-based subscription process with online portals and electronic compliance checks, reducing customer onboarding time to minutes instead of days,” AlphaPoint said.  Security tokens are increasingly being adopted by the capital markets industry, Donde said, adding: “Blockchain technology provides new tools to drive transparency and trust between investors and [security token] issuers.”  AlphaPoint is backed by Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital, which took part in a $15 million round back in June.  The company has also seen notable hires recently. Scott Grayson, former chief sales officer at enterprise blockchain startup R3, joined the firm in January as a senior vice president for institutional sales. And, in November, Cboe Global Markets' head of equity options, Kapil Rathi, joined the firm as global head of trading markets.

42402726,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcbyc,1553774411,Crypto Startup TokenPay Buys Equity Stake in Heidi Klum Lingerie Maker,"Cryptocurrency startup TokenPay is getting into the lingerie business.  Revealed in a filing Wednesday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Switzerland-based startup has spent $1.3 million for a 6 percent equity stake in Naked Brand Group (NAKD), the Australian lingerie company best known for supermodel Heidi Klum’s signature fashion lines.  TokenPay's Derek Capo told CoinDesk the move is part of the startup’s broader diversification strategy following a December 2017 token sale that netted 2,000 bitcoin, or roughly $20 million. Spending token sale proceeds on equity investments has been a hedge against crypto market volatility, Capo said.  Still, it may take until 2020 or beyond for shoppers to buy Klum’s lingerie with TPay tokens. (We’ve reached out to NAKD for comment and will update if we hear back.)  Speaking of the startup’s investment in this lingerie company, Capo added:  “They [NAKD] also mentioned they are interested in working with a blockchain company for logistics. We’re interested in them accepting TokenPay’s merchant services platform so that they can accept crypto across all of their brands.”  Those merchant services would allow private purchases of negligee using TokenPay’s native token, TPAY, because the coin utilizes the Tor network to hide users’ IP addresses. Unlike most assets used in 2017 token sales, TPAY is not ethereum-based. Capo said 32,000 people participated in the 2017 sale by purchasing TPAY with bitcoin.  Equity deals  In the interview, Capo further detailed how TokenPay has spent its sale earnings so far – including nearly $4 million spent buying equity in Germany’s WEG Bank AG in mid-2018. In an arrangement initially brokered over Twitter, a 9.9 percent equity stake in the bank was donated to the Litecoin Foundation, while TokenPay kept the same amount of equity for itself.  Although there is no formal commitment to integrate TPAY or TokenPay merchant services, Capo hopes investing in companies like Naked Brand Group and WEG Bank AG will eventually facilitate both TPAY use cases and the infrastructure for that token's adoption.  “We’re trying to get every single angle possible because we realize there are many opportunities in this industry,” Capo said. “Once you start using it [TPAY], then we’ll be able to offer you the opportunity to work with the German bank, open up a bank account there and convert your fiat if you choose.”  Other purchases with token sale earnings included a 10 percent stake in the privacy-coin-oriented mutual fund TokenSussie, a portfolio of crypto-related domain names and an undisclosed amount of equity in the Latin American blockchain company BlockSize, which is currently working on a decentralized exchange.  Plus, Capo said TokenPay also paid more than $50,000 for traditional exchange listings and donated $2.5 million worth of crypto to the Verge (XVG) community to incentivize the adult entertainment site Pornhub to accept XVG for porn subscriptions. Much like the bank equity donation to the Litecoin Foundation, this marketing strategy leverages outreach through crypto-adjacent communities that could promote TPAY in return.  In sum, over the past 15 months, the startup has spent more than half of the fiat value of its token sale. According to Capo, the startup retains roughly 10 percent of its bitcoin in a long-term treasury and has spent $1.5 million on operating costs such as salaries.  “We’ve built a lot of infrastructure and also a lot of deals,” Capo said. “Releasing the development of technology stuff takes time. So now you’ll start to see some of the products benefiting from the deals that we did earlier.”  Heidi Klum image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TOKEN SALE,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/03/28/crypto-startup-tokenpay-buys-equity-stake-in-heidi-klum-lingerie-maker,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8dc7b6af1556ebada06f0b2a708d8f86ceb9a7f8-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402738,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcc8S,1553771720,Bitcoin Needs Price Gain for Bull Reversal in March,"View  Bitcoin created a bullish ""engulfing candle"" last month, confirming seller exhaustion. A bullish reversal, however, would only be confirmed if price closes above $4,190 (high of the engulfing candle) on March 31.  A bullish monthly close would open the doors to $5,000, although gains may be hampered by the crucial 21-week moving average, which is still trending south.  The prospect of a bullish monthly close above $4,190 would drop sharply if prices find acceptance under the 30-day moving average, currently at $3,900. That average line has served as strong support at least three times this month.  Bitcoin now has a high price target if it is to see a bullish reversal this month, price charts suggest.  The leading cryptocurrency jumped more than 10 percent in February, snapping the record six-month losing streak. More importantly, the recovery rally seen in February engulfed the price action seen in the preceding month.  Essentially, BTC created a bullish engulfing candle on the monthly chart following an 80 percent drop from the record high of $20,000 reached in December 2017. While that pattern is widely considered an early warning of potential bullish reversal, traders usually wait for more credible signs of a trend change, preferably a close above the candle's high.  Put simply, a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change would be confirmed if prices close (UTC) above the February high of $4,190 on March 31. That would also reinforce the bearish-to-bullish trend change signaled by several longer duration indicators over the last few weeks.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at around $4,000 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.4 percent rise on a 24-hour basis.  Monthly chart  BTC clocked a high of $4,190 and created a bullish engulfing candle last month – likely a sign of bargain hunting following a prolonged sell-off. So far, the follow-through has been positive, confirming the bear exhaustion.  A UTC close above $4,190 on March 31 would confirm a longer-term bullish reversal and open the doors to the psychological hurdle of $5,000.  A failure to close above that key level would weaken the bullish case and could increase selling pressure.  Daily and 4-hour charts  On the daily chart, BTC bounced up from the 30-day moving average (MA) earlier this week, invalidating Monday's bearish close below $3,920.  However, the case for a monthly close above$4,190 would strengthen if prices establish a higher high above the March 21 high of $4,055 in the next 48 hours. That would also confirm a bull flag breakout on the 4-hour chart – a continuation pattern which often accelerates the preceding bullish move.  On the downside, the 30-day MA, currently at $3,900, is the level to beat for the bears.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42402766,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcc2Y,1553767252,Blockchain Exchange Secures $50 Million in Diamonds for ETF Launch,"Blockchain-based trading platform CEDEX says it has now secured a supply of more than 6,000 diamonds ahead of its launch of a diamond exchange-traded fund (ETF).  Announcing the news on Wednesday, CEDEX said that the diamonds – worth over $50 million – will provide traders with a variety of investment options prior to the launch of the ETF, which is currently in development. The supply comes from diamond holders registering their stock on the exchange for trading, the firm told CoinDesk.    CEDEX claims to have used blockchain tech and a proprietary algorithm to overcome several hurdles that previously prevented diamonds from becoming a tradable asset class like gold: lack of transparency, liquidity and fungibility.    CEDEX said its mission is to turn diamonds into a tradeable asset class, and it aims to enable customers to trade on its inventory and generate liquidity in the market.  The exchange – which launched in beta in November 2018 – will use tokens to allow customers to trade in diamonds of different sizes and values with “low” carrying cost, according to the announcement.  The platform has its own ERC-20 token too, CEDEX Coin, which CEDEX says on its website is compliant and can be used for trading and investment on the exchange. Its ""DEX"" algorithm gauges the value of diamonds based on their characteristics and shows sellers a DEX score and estimated market price, according to the firm's website.  CEDEX co-founder and CEO, Saar Levi, said:  “The vast inventory available combined with CEDEX unique technology opens up for traditional and digital markets the opportunity to develop financial instruments that will initially create the liquidity needed to jump-start our vision – transforming diamonds into a new asset class.”  “Bridging the gap between existing financial markets and the diamond industry will fuel this untapped market from a $90 billion industry to an estimated $300-$400 billion,” Levi added.  The firm added that it's currently in talks with commodity brokers, exchanges, banks and ETF issuers in order to offer them a software solution that will allow integration of its ETF products onto their trading platforms.  CEDEX said it raised $20 million in March 2018 to develop its platform.

42402735,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcc7T,1553763715,Marco Polo Blockchain Built on R3's Corda Sees First Live Trades,"The first two real-world transactions have been conducted on Marco Polo, the trade finance blockchain built on R3's Corda platform.  Announced Thursday, the trades took place between two German companies: Voith, a manufacturer of machines such as turbines, generators and transmissions, and KSB SE, a supplier of pumps and valves. One transaction involved the delivery of special hydraulic couplings from Germany to China and the other the delivery of pumps within Germany.  While all that may sound prosaic, these transactions were notable since the necessary data was exchanged through distributed ledger technology (DLT), ditching the usual slow and costly physical documents and intermediaries, according to a press release from the consortium behind the blockchain.  The companies agreed on the order and delivery details through the Marco Polo network, and after the goods were delivered, the shipment information was entered into the system and ""automatically matched with previously agreed data, triggering an irrevocable payment obligation on the part of the buyer’s bank,"" the release said.  The amount of money involved was not disclosed, nor did Marco Polo spell out which firm was the buyer and which was the seller.  Banks on board  Payments and financing were handled by two banks, also German: Commerzbank and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg, both founding members of the Marco Polo consortium.      ""The transaction proves that blockchain technology offers our clients a payment undertaking and state-of-the-art financing for trade transactions with both foreign countries and domestically,” said Nikolaus Giesbert, a divisional board member for trade finance and cash management at Commerzbank, which has also tested DLT in capital markets.      Dr. Christian Ricken, a member of LBBW's board of managing directors and head of its capital market business and asset management/international business, said DLT in trade finance “will make transactions faster, easier and more secure. Not only are we breaking new ground in terms of technology, but also in the cooperation between banks and businesses.""  Next steps              Marco Polo said the next step will be executing transactions with a direct connection to the customers' enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, though it did not give a timeframe for this  Founded in 2017 by R3 and another blockchain tech firm, TradeIX, the Marco Polo network now lists 13 bank members on its website. Down the road, the consortium hopes to bring in more banks, as well as transportation and insurance companies, ""so that the entire value chain for foreign trade transactions is represented digitally with data,"" Marco Polo said.  However, Marco Polo is well behind rival network We.Trade, which already went live last year (and also has a baker's dozen banks on board). On the other hand, We.Trade has a narrower focus (European small and mid-sized enterprises) and a nimbler corporate structure (it's not a consortium) than member-controlled, globally minded Marco Polo.

Secondly, the exchange has formed Kraken Security Labs, aimed to improve the security of both its own products and the “entire cryptocurrency ecosystem” by performing ""vulnerability"" research on third-party products, such as hardware and software wallets.  Percoco said his vision for Kraken is to “expand upon the strong, industry leading security foundation,” and utilize advanced security products such as threat intelligence, behavior analytics and adversarial deception techniques, and incorporate them into the exchange’s present and future products.  The CSO further said that Kraken will keep developing with other client-facing security enhancements in the near future. The exchange’s product management team will provide “constant improvement into 2020 and beyond” through its security features roadmap.  “While this roadmap is not made public, you’ll be hearing about security enhancements and upgrades as they are released and made available to you,"" Percoco said.

42402716,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcVkw,1553740815,Top Cap and Delta Cap: New Metrics for Spotting Bitcoin Price Trend Reversals,"Believe it or not, there are more ways to anticipate the future market value of bitcoin than through practicing technical analysis or by observing network activity developments.  While valuable in their own right, thanks to researchers Willy Woo and David Puell, several new experimental bitcoin valuation metrics were released in February that combine the two fields to create a more holistic view of bitcoin’s market.  Sample sizes are small in the cryptocurrency markets, with the oldest, bitcoin, having existed just 10 years, but two of the newly released metrics termed “Top Cap” and Delta Cap” have shown to be effective at identifying the tops and bottoms of bitcoin’s wild market cycles thus far.  Delta Cap  Proposed by Puell, the metric that successfully caught both bear market bottoms in 2011 and 2015, and that is known as the Delta Cap, is calculated as follows:    Delta cap = Realized cap - Average cap      Average cap = ""cumulative sum of daily market cap values / age of the market in days.""      Realized cap = “UTXOs are aggregated and assigned a price based on the BTCUSD market price at the time when said UTXOs last moved”    Resembling a long-term moving average that is touted for offering price support and resistance, the delta cap has shown to have the same effect by providing price support at roughly $2.50, the bottom in 2011, and $176, the bottom in 2015.  As can be seen above, delta cap is making a case for bitcoin having bottomed out once again, a point made evident by the fact that its price bounced off of the metric during its drop to $3,200 at the end of 2018,  Indeed, delta cap may be pointing to bitcoin’s market leaving its bearish trend, but there could be more nuance to the situation than first meets the eye.  Bitcoin has only ever bottomed out and escaped one of its infamous bear markets after the delta cap and average caps have collided with eachother, or came very close to it, as can be seen in both 2011 and 2015.  At the time of writing, delta cap is about $1,600 higher than the average cap, theoretically suggesting bitcoin’s price will either have to wait for the average cap to rise and meet the delta cap, or the delta cap will need to fall to meet the average cap by way of more significant market depreciation before a true bottom can form.  Top cap  Proposed by Woo in collaboration with Puell, top cap aims to achieve the opposite of the delta cap, in that is has been experimentally configured to pinpoint the tops of bitcoin’s explosive bull markets.    Top cap = Average cap * 35    According to Woobull.com, the multiple of 35 was found to pinpoint bitcoin historical tops.  As can be seen, the metric also resembles a moving average and effectively provided resistance at $35 in 2011, $237 in 2013 and once again at around $1,000 in the same year, all of which were precise market tops followed by significant, albeit temporary depreciation.  Most recently, bitcoin’s price came in contact with the top cap when its market reached peak euphoria and an all-time high near $20,000 in 2018. At the time of writing, bitcoin's price is still roughly 80 percent below the all-time high.  Putting it all together  When both delta and top cap are plotted on the same chart, a “valuation Bollinger band” is created as Woo puts it, where the two metrics create the anticipated boundaries of bitcoin’s market movement.  Currently located at $48,724, the top cap paints a rosy picture for the future of bitcoin if it indeed endures another boisterous bull market, although the creator Woo thinks $90,000 is a better estimate “at a minimum on the early trajectory” for bitcoin's next significant market top.
