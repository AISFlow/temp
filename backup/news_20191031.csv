42403473,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdg4Ua,1572559208,"Bitcoin Needs 'Real Use Cases' to Become Digital Gold, Says ICE Chief","Bitcoin might become ""digital gold,"" but first it needs to be used more in everyday business, Intercontinental Exchange's chief executive said.  During a quarterly earnings call Thursday, ICE head Jeffrey Sprecher said that he sees use in transactions as the prerequisite to bitcoin becoming a long-term store of value. The company's Bakkt subsidiary, which runs a bitcoin futures market, announced this week that it is developing an app for consumers to buy goods from merchants, beginning with Starbucks.  A number of Bakkt's employees already see bitcoin as digital gold, Sprecher said. (So, it should be noted, does much of the current bitcoin community.) To him, that's premature.  ""Because I'm old I think of [how] gold became a store of value because at one point it was a currency,"" he said. ""We had gold coins, it was in circulation, and over time because of the nature of its ability to spend, ... it became a store of value and today, you know, in a crisis we all accept gold as a form of payment.""  Bitcoin may follow a similar trajectory, Sprecher said, citing its development and mining capabilities. He added:  ""We don't think that that that whole space will be relevant and and grow unless there are real use cases and we do ... think that a use case is going to be the digital transfer of value through payments.""  But unlike bitcoin's critics, Sprecher sees this as plausible. ""It may well be that, rather than convert bitcoin to fiat currency and then use [that] fiat currency to buy goods and services, merchants and users will accept bitcoin directly,"" he said.  Parties who do transact directly with bitcoin would avoid the foreign exchange costs associated with converting back and forth between fiat. Bakkt is looking to serve this market by building a digital platform to facilitate such transactions.  ICE (which also owns the New York Stock Exchange) has about 50 individuals working on payments infrastructure for Bakkt. The company is targeting an early 2020 launch date for its consumer app.  Options  Sprecher also detailed the impetus for Bakkt to launch bitcoin options, which the company plans to do in December.  Financial institutions are still wary of entering the space, with many waiting to see how regulators approach crypto first, he said. Bakkt is hoping to tackle this issue by providing a more regulated environment in the bitcoin ecosystem.  ""You know, retail global retail customers have been very comfortable for whatever reason being early adopters on unregulated platforms that call themselves exchanges, but really have no particular regulatory oversight,"" he explained. ""We think there's an opportunity as what we're building out with Bakkt to bring that whole thing into a more transparent regulatory footprint and lend our expertise.""  Bakkt went live with its flagship bitcoin futures last month after more than a year of working on regulatory approvals and building out its platform. While the company initially saw low volume for its bitcoin futures contracts, trading has recently picked up.  ""It just so happens that the way we've launched our bitcoin futures contract is that we are a source of price discovery because we're physically delivered,"" Sprecher said, meaning the contracts are paid in bitcoin rather than dollars.  ""We're not dependent on the prices that come out of these unregulated cash markets,"" he said, referring to the spot exchanges that dominate the market. ""We develop our own settlement price and so that lends itself very nicely to an options market where people that trade options and hedge with the underlying can have perfect hedging in one venue that they know is transparent.  ""So that was the pressure to get the options out quickly,"" he said.

The new outpost will join Binance’s current mainland China office in Shanghai.  It's not clear what exactly the office will do or when it will open, but the move follows a slew of announcements from Chinese authorities, including President Xi Jinping outlining China’s new blockchain ambitions.  A Binance spokesperson would neither confirm nor deny the plan, saying:  ""We plan to do more to support blockchain development in China and globally. We do not have an office in China, but are planning to grow our presence more in this important market.""  Relations between Binance leadership and Chinese authorities appear to have warmed recently, with the exchange publishing a report on China’s plans for a digital fiat currency over the summer and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao stating this week on Twitter that he believes the Chinese central bank is having a positive impact on the crypto industry. This comes just one year after China’s censorship firewall blocked access to the Binance website.  These days, Binance executives have publicly stated the exchange is working with multiple governments on an upcoming stablecoin project called Venus. Binance co-founder and chief marketing officer Yi He told Bloomberg that Binance will help governments “fully supervise” the cryptocurrency industry through such projects to ensure “stable, sustainable development.”  Although Zhao grew up in Canada, he was born in China and worked at the China-based exchange OkCoin before founding his own empire. Binance made its first investment in a Chinese crypto company, Mars Finance, last September. Many of the exchange’s earlier investors hail from the Chinese tech industry, including Black Hole Capital and Funcity Capital.  Zhao added via Twitter on Tuesday that Binance currently sees a “few million dollars a day” worth of volume from Chinese users, especially via the peer-to-peer functionality that became available in China earlier this month. However, an increased focus on serving Chinese users doesn’t inherently mean the company is working with authorities on products or services beyond the Venus stablecoin project and compliance efforts.  “I don’t have anything that’s not public,” Zhao said in the Twitter video, referring to Chinese government strategies, adding:  “All of my readings are from public sources.”  UPDATE (Nov. 4, 23:00 UTC): This article was updated to include a statement from a Binance spokesperson received after publication.

On Thursday, the U.K’s Financial Conduct Authority granted Koine an e-money license – known as an EMI license – allowing Koine to issue its own digital cash and provide other payment services to institutional clients.  The EMI license, however, does not certify or sanction Koine’s digital asset custodian services, the company said in a statement. Those services “are currently outside the UK regulatory perimeter,” Koine said.  For the moment Koine’s EMI license applies across European markets while the UK remains in the E.U. That would change if and when Brexit comes to Britain; the current leave date is set for January 31, 2020.  A Koine spokeswoman told CoinDesk that Brexit would not impact their business approach.  “We believe in the importance of the UK as a focal point for our line of business, to the extent that we have applied to additional permissions in the country for securities. However, we retain our international vision and, in applying for licenses in Luxembourg, a major financial center in its own right, this provides optionality in the event of an adverse Brexit scenario.”  She further noted Koine is also considering pursuing licensing in Abu Dhabi and across the U.S.  In a company statement, Koine CEO and Chairman Hugh L. Hughes said that the EMI licensing clears the way for more digital asset developments:  “With our EMI authorisation now issued by the FCA, we are rapidly moving to implement the market infrastructure necessary to support institutional participation in the digital assets marketplace.”  British pounds image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/31/pre-brexit-koine-wins-e-money-license-from-uks-fca-now-seeking-luxembourg-uae-us-permissions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e472cfcb775f9b66211ff0a96600331db4579c6a-640x331.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In simultaneous press releases, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleged that XBT, otherwise known as First Global Credit, sold security-based swaps for bitcoin without registering on a national exchange.  According to the charges, XBT solicited or accepted futures orders from 24 U.S. customers between March 2016 and July 2017, accepting bitcoin for margin trades. The company did not register as an FCM during this time.  XBT had overall at least 90 investors, who conducted more than 18,000 security-based swaps between 2014 and 2019, conducting more than $100 million in transactions ""based on U.S.-listed securities,"" according to a legal filing.

42403471,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdg4Tb,1572545117,UK Banking Pilot Aims to Streamline Compliance Using Factom Blockchain,"Crypto startup Knabu is piloting bank regulatory reporting with Factom, one of the earliest enterprise blockchain companies.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the London-based firm is launching the 30-day pilot today.  Knabu is best known as a payments company with a smart-deposit product meant to help companies mitigate the risks of self-custodying assets on a blockchain. It is simultaneously applying for a UK banking license, aiming to establish itself as a bank that can serve crypto and blockchain firms normally excluded from traditional banking services.  “The purpose of the pilot is to start proving some of the efficiencies that blockchain brings – specifically as core infrastructure for a bank,” Gabrielle Patrick, founder and CEO of Knabu, told CoinDesk, adding:  “The average cost of regulatory compliance for a bank is about 30 percent of its budget. … We’re a blockchain-first company and felt that it was necessary to demonstrate the features that can remodel that.”  Compliance costs for banks are high because of how many manual processes have to be repeated. Knabu will run know-your-customer (KYC), know-your-business (KYB) and anti-money laundering (AML) checks on customers, encrypt the data, and send it to Factom to be recorded on the ethereum and bitcoin blockchains.  “We wanted to avoid repeating the same KYC, KYB and AML checks,” Hakim Mamoni, chief technology officer and co-founder of Knabu, told CoinDesk. “[Traditional banks] don’t have the same flexibility in terms of having access to the data.”  As a part of wanting to bank other underserved companies, Patrick is interested in also serving small-to-medium enterprises as well as fintech startups.  The only customer pilot participant that Knabu would name is crypto trading platform EthBits. IdentityMind will perform Knabu’s KYC and KYB checks while DMG Blockchain will use blockchain forensic tools like Blockseer and Walletscore to perform AML due diligence on customer bitcoin and ethereum wallets.  The Factom blockchain builds data chains and then preserves them on the ethereum and bitcoin blockchains using a Merkle root. Factom’s service, which in the past was operated by customers using factoid tokens, is being run entirely by Factom with Knabu pushing data to the firm using an application programming interface (API).  “This allows us to be able to borrow the security that you get from the power of the bitcoin and ethereum blockchains to verify that your data is what you claim it to be,” Carl DiClementi, vice president of product at Factom, told CoinDesk.  Knabu CEO Patrick says the pilot is in line with work from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority exploring ways in which financial institutions can digitize regulatory reporting. In the future, Knabu aims to also test reporting capital reserves on Factom’s blockchain.  “The goal is to rip out any inefficiency and to serve underserved businesses,” Patrick said, adding:  “Many sectors are underserved because the cost is too high.”  Bank image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | FIAT | REGULATION,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/31/uk-banking-pilot-aims-to-streamline-compliance-using-factom-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5031fd5ace2dcddb74d8ae9a501d53e3636f5a7a-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403468,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdg4Pf,1572531856,Blockstack Will Pay Liquidity Provider GSR to Trade Its STX Token,"Blockstack, one of the first blockchain startups to have raised money in a Reg A+ offering, has hired GSR Markets to trade its ""stacks"" (STX) token.  According to an Oct. 24 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the blockchain startup will pay GSR for providing liquidity in markets outside of the U.S.  Such arrangements between token issuers and trading firms have long been whispered about, but Blockstack is one of the few to publicly disclose doing so.  These deals can be controversial due to potential conflicts of interest, but Blockstack CEO Muneeb Ali told CoinDesk this one was structured to avoid such issues.  “We want the market maker to be an independent player,"" Ali said. ""GSR has full discretion on how they operate and Blockstack PBC has no profit-sharing with them. We decided to work with GSR because their focus on compliance and ensuring high quality aligns well with us.”  Blockstack raised $23 million in its registered token offering in September, including $7.6 million from investors in Asia.  For a one-time setup fee of $100,000 and a monthly payment of $20,000 for six months, GSR agreed to ""provide services related to increasing the liquidity"" of STX, as well as to analyze market conditions. Blockstack will also lend $1 million-worth of bitcoin and ether with zero interest to fund the trading.  If the agreement should be terminated at a later date, GSR will return the bitcoin and ether, with half being calculated using the value of the cryptocurrencies against the value of STX.  According to a separate agreement, GSR will trade STX using its proprietary trading bot, provide Blockstack with daily reports on the STX market activity, analyze the market conditions and seek new exchanges Blockstack could approach for listings. All these activities should happen outside of the U.S., the document reads.  Hiring a professional market maker to provide liquidity is a common practice on the legacy markets and has become one for the crypto markets, too, says Eric Wall, a former blockchain lead at trading tech company Cinnober.  ""Market makers serve a crucial role in thinly traded markets and are common everywhere where there's trading, be it NASDAQ or Bittrex,"" Wall said, adding:  ""They provide a base-line of liquidity where there otherwise would be none. It's essential in order to give investors the opportunity to enter and exit an asset without being too dependent on being matched with a seller or a buyer at that exact time same time.""  Without such market participants, the volatility of crypto tokens can soar when there are too few actual orders. That can turn people away from trading a token and ""create bad publicity for the issuer,"" Wall explained.  Blockstack got STX listed on the Binance and HashKey Pro exchanges last week. For the Binance listing, Blockstack paid 833,333 STX, or roughly $250,000, according to an earlier filing.  The company's CEO, Muneeb Ali, told The Block that it was a ""long-term payment"" meant to incentivize Binance to keep STX listed ""over many years.""  The token is currently trading at $0.20 per token on Binance, 30 percent down from its initial price of $0.30.

42403477,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdg4VZ,1572530418,New Blockchain-Based System Will Track Steers From Hoof to Plate,"Peruvian shoppers are weeks away blockchain answering the age-old question first posed in 1984: “Where’s the beef?”  A pilot project by Wong Supermarket, a Peruvian chain owned by Chile’s major retail conglomerate Cencosud, will allow suppliers and consumers to scan and check the provenance of various meat products. The app is a partnership between Cencosud and Citizens Reserve subsidiary SUKU, the Silicon Valley-based supply chain company whose founders hail from the Deloitte Blockchain Lab.  At launch, the consumer-facing app will feature enterprise-level blockchain backend using J.P. Morgan’s permissioned blockchain platform, Quorum.  The platform will be available in 20 different Wong stores and cover all meat products carrying the SUKU logo. Just like a Ⓤ or K emblem signals to Jewish consumers that a rabbi inspected the product, the SUKU emblem will mean that the company has tracked the path of the meat from steer to shelf.  Unlike the kosher certification, however, you can actually dive into the Wong meat’s supply blockchain history and see a record validating each part of the meat’s history.  SUKU CEO Yonathan Lapchik told CoinDesk that this blockchain use case has enormous potential in terms of applications for the wider global consumer goods market.  “You have a large group of consumers that want to buy sustainability, and want to buy transparent products from brands. But they don’t do it today – they don’t trust what the brands are saying. There’s a $1 trillion market sitting there for companies and brands to take if they can speak the same language as those consumers do.”  Even the animals’ health and welfare are tracked, stored and then reviewable on the blockchain, Lapchik said.  “Every time a producer says ‘I vaccinated all the animals, all the animals have their animal welfare certified,’ then the system automatically triggers an input to the party that needs to confirm it, and they will confirm ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ and submit the certificate.”  Wong had been one of Peru’s most trusted brands according to the Lima Chamber of Commerce, but when Chile’s Cencosud purchased the decades-old chain for $500 million in 2007, Reuters reported locals went into an uproar, citing fears that the store would change.  But the company has since regained and rebuilt that consumer-facing confidence, winning recognition as recently as 2017 for being one of Peruvians' most trusted brands.  Now, with the new app and transparent supply chain, Cencosud Peru’s manager of perishables Enrique Ameghino sees this as another way to build trust.  “SUKU and blockchain technology are helping us further develop our relationship with our customers,” Ameghino said in a statement. “It is another avenue for us to communicate with them directly.”  “We are seeing this transition from systems based on trust to systems based on transparency. That’s what Satoshi gave us: That opportunity to bring transparency through technology,” said Lapchik.

42403462,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdg4Mi,1572526808,Longtime Bitcoin Advocate Launches Broker-Dealer for Crypto Firms,"Longtime bitcoin advocate Bruce Fenton has created a new broker-dealer for digital asset firms and financial advisors called Watchdog Capital.  The firm is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, public filings show. It’s a subsidiary of digital securities firm Chainstone Labs, also led by Fenton, founder of the Satoshi Roundtable conference. He is also a former board member of Overstock’s security token platform tZERO and was the 2015-2016 executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation.  “A lot of companies have been advised by their lawyers to become a broker-dealer,” Fenton said. “What we can do is license a representative, and they can have their own business.”  Watchdog is capable of securities underwriting, investment banking, crowdfunding, Reg A+ offerings, starting real estate investment trusts and doing over-the-counter trading for retail and institutional business.  Fenton began the process to license a broker-dealer around nine months ago and was approved to operate in July, but he has had the idea since April 2016 when The DAO, an ill-fated decentralized autonomous organization, debuted.  “At the time, knowing the regulations so well, I said ‘This is not going to fly with the SEC,” Fenton said. “I wanted to acquire a firm and get the personnel in place because I think tokens are going to be a big thing … I thought they were going to be mostly declared securities.”  Long leash  Watchdog is serving as a back office to crypto and blockchain companies as well as serving individual representatives such as financial advisors. Independent financial consultants can use Watchdog’s license to trade crypto for interested clients.  “They might be at a large wirehouse like Merrill Lynch … In some cases representatives of the firms aren’t even allowed to discuss bitcoin,” he said.  Fenton describes this process as “decentralized” because Watchdog Capital allows financial advisors to run their businesses however they want to.  He wouldn't say what percentage of Watchdog's business with crypto and blockchain-related firms would make up but predicted all assets will be tokenized in the future, including government bonds. (In December 2018, Chainstone got into the space by issuing 12.4 million shares in the form of digital tokens).  “You can’t move your Apple shares and you definitely can’t move shares of your local favorite restaurant around the way you can move a token,” Fenton said. “If you can tokenize those investments, it opens up a lot of exciting doors in the way that you can form capital and move money around the world.”  Bruce Fenton (right), Peter Kroll (middle) and Vitalik Buterin (left) image via CoinDesk archives.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/31/longtime-bitcoin-advocate-launches-broker-dealer-for-crypto-firms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/09dc6fa2bbe6934334750616b407787291f4aa4f-919x583.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403476,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdg4WY,1572521433,Bitcoin May See November Price Boost With Halving Due in Six Months,"View  Bitcoin tends to pick up a strong bid six months ahead of the reward halving, according to historical data.  With the halving event due in May 2020, BTC may rise above the recent high of $10,350 in November and could challenge the 2019 high of $13,880 over the next couple of months.  Shorter term, a contracting triangle breakdown on the hourly chart suggests scope for a drop to $8,820 in the next 24 hours. The bear case would be invalidated if prices rise above the hourly chart resistance of $9,245.  A quick move above $9,245 and a rally to the 100-day average at $9,606 shouldn't be ruled out, as the recent pullback from $10,350 lacks volume support.      Bitcoin will likely put on a good show in November with a price-positive event due in six months.  The number one cryptocurrency by market value is leaving October on a positive note, having recovered sharply from five-month lows below $7,500 seen a week ago.  The rally could be extended further next month, as the cryptocurrency is set to undergo a mining reward halving in May 2020. The process is aimed at curbing inflation by reducing the bitcoin reward per block mined on the blockchain by 50 percent every four years.  Currently, miners get 12.5 BTC for every block mined. That will drop to 6.25 BTC after the halving, meaning 50 percent fewer bitcoins will be generated every 10 minutes. To put it another way, the supply of new coins will drop by half after May.  In the past, the cryptocurrency has picked up a strong bid six months ahead of the reward halving.  Bitcoin's block reward was cut from 50 BTC to 25 BTC in November 2012. BTC rallied from $5 to $16 in the three months to mid-August and built a new base around $10.00 in November.  On similar lines, BTC jumped from $360 to $780 in the four months to mid-June 2016, before trimming gains and falling back to $465 in August, when the block reward was cut from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC.  The data indicates the market begins pricing in an impending supply cut six months in advance.  So, if history is a guide, BTC may rise well above the recent high of $10,350 in November and could challenge the 2019 high of $13,880 over the next couple of months.  Positive Seasonality  Adding to the likelihood of a rally, bitcoin has scored gains in November in six out of the last eight years.  Notably, November was a green month for six straight years from 2012 to 2017. The winning run ended last year with a 37 percent drop – the biggest November loss on record. Back then, however, BTC was in a bear market. The cryptocurrency had already dropped 70 percent from the record high of $20,000 reached in December 2017.  This time, the overall trend is bullish, as indicated by the triple-digit year-to-date gains. BTC, therefore, is likely to revive the November winning tend.  Currently, bitcoin is changing hands around $9,100 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.2 percent drop on a 24-hour basis. The cryptocurrency is trapped between key moving averages (MAs), as seen in the chart below.  Daily and hourly charts  Bitcoin has come under pressure in the last 24 hours, as expected, but the downside is being restricted around the 200-day MA, currently at $9,025.  The contracting triangle breakdown seen on the hourly chart indicates that bitcoin could drop further to the former resistance-turned-support of $8,820. A violation there would expose next support lined up at $8,474.  The outlook, as per the hourly chart, would turn bullish above the lower high of $9,245. A quick move above $9,245 cannot be ruled out as the recent pullback from $10,350 is accompanied by a drop in trading volumes. A low-volume correction is often short-lived.  A break above $9,245 would likely yield a retest of the 100-day MA at $9,606. Note that BTC has failed three times in the last five days to hold on to gains above the long-term average. As a result, a UTC close above the 100-day MA could embolden bulls, leading to a sustained move above $10,000.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42403470,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdg4Sc,1572517211,Bitcoin Dissident Sees Dark Warnings in China's Blockchain Push,"China’s recent multi-front embrace of blockchain technology has divided the global cryptocurrency community. While some see it as helpful validation, others worry that crypto is diverging further from its anti-authoritarian roots.  Authorities in China have long discouraged investment in grassroots cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. But the world’s most populous country is making significant progress with plans for a national cryptocurrency that could increase the government’s surveillance powers over the economy.  CoinDesk spoke with one anonymous bitcoiner who grew up in China and has since moved elsewhere in East Asia. Far from seeing blockchain “adoption” as a march toward liberation, he expects the government to use such technologies to increase its control over the population. After all, the propaganda office for China’s Communist Party announced a blockchain-based application over the weekend that allows members to pledge their allegiance to the party.  Given China’s mass detention centers currently being used to “re-educate” over a million Chinese Muslims, this bitcoiner feared local minorities will face even harsher conditions under a fully integrated financial system controlled by the government.  What follows is a condensed transcript of the interview with this greybeard bitcoiner, a programmer who started following the project in 2014.  The text has been edited for clarity. We agreed to keep the identity of this person secret because he feared repercussions for his family.      Q: What do you think about the recent “pro-blockchain” announcements coming out of China?  It terrifies the crap out of me.  Crypto is technology is just like nuclear fusion is just technology: You can use it to create nuclear generators that might benefit a lot of humanity, or you can use it to create atomic bombs. We do need to think about ethics when it comes to these things.  If the value is something a totalitarian state can take hold of and use to track every single person and what they’re doing, enforcing the strictest currency controls, then this is what they are going to do.  Q: Why do you think there are so many people celebrating such news this as a positive indicator for “adoption” in the crypto community?  People in East Asia are very comfortable with the idea that the government is like our parents, that they’ll take care of us.  Even if they read novels like Brave New World or 1984, the world to them is OK for the most part. But the few people who want to act in a way that the government does not agree with will be persecuted.  My parents have been [Christian] missionaries for about 18 years now, and being a missionary is outlawed in China. Our phones were getting tapped, our computer was getting hacked. My parents’ names were on the Chinese police blacklist. People like my parents are called terrorists or Tibetan freedom fighters.  In China, there’s very strict capital controls. So when I read about bitcoin, it was like, “This is a great way to store money with real censorship resistance.”  Q: How did you guys live under such constant surveillance?  We had very specific protocols for operational security. For example, when we’re talking over the phone or email, we switch out all sensitive words and make sure our servers are not located in China.  My parents once had their WePay and AliPay accounts cut off. But luckily they had cash, fiat currency and physical cash so they could live. If China had been 100 percent digital, there would have been no way for them to survive.  Q: How does your family use (relatively) decentralized blockchain technology today?  I don’t send my parents money in crypto. But my biggest fear growing up was that my parents would be deported. In China, after they tell you that you need to leave the country, you need to liquidate all your assets in 48 hours. We used to practice this thing where we’d pack everything we have in less than 48 hours. It was kind of like our drill.  Right now, all my parents’ assets are in crypto. As long as there’s one of us, somewhere in the world with access to our private key, our wealth is OK. It’s still very difficult for my parents to access their crypto, though. They can’t do it by themselves. They definitely need my help. That’s why I hold most of their stuff. In that way, accessibility [with crypto] is still lacking, even if it provides a store of value.

42403478,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdg4XX,1572515269,Bitcoin's White Paper Turns 11 as Network Passes Milestones,"Happy birthday, bitcoin.  Halloween 2019 marks the eleventh anniversary of the release of the white paper for the first fully decentralized, peer-to-peer electronic cash by anonymous creator(s) Satoshi Nakomoto. In the wake of the Great Recession of 2007–2009, a single email for a small collective of cypherpunks proved to be the catalyst for a monetary revolution.  “I’ve been working on a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party,” Satoshi wrote to open his email, attaching the bitcoin white paper.  Rolling out bitcoin’s code the following January with the mining of the genesis block, bitcoin’s first year was inauspicious at best. Eleven years later, however, most metrics point towards a bright future. The white paper's birthday month proved to be one of the best yet.  October in review  Looking at the numbers, the last 10 months have given bitcoin hodlers much to be thankful for; October, even more so.  Bitcoin's price jumped some 40 percent in 24 hours on Oct. 26, briefly breaking out to $10,000. As ARK Invest analyst Yassine Elmandjra wrote on Twitter, the price movement has only happened three times in bitcoin's history.    The previous two times Bitcoin saw a >40% daily gain, it was trading at $0.40 and $5.65.        Today, Bitcoin’s 42% swing is the 3rd largest daily gain in price history.    Data via @coinmetrics pic.twitter.com/PKHQgNlSUy    — Yassine Elmandjra (@yassineARK) October 26, 2019      Bitcoin’s hash rate – a good metric for the amount of energy put towards mining bitcoin’s and securing the network – hit an all-time high at over 110 exahashes per second (EH/s) on Oct. 23.  As recent initial public offering filings for mining giants Canaan and Bitmain show, bitcoin mining has gone a long way since the early days of CPU farming, and is now big business.  Bitcoin also just mined its 18 million coin, leaving a mad scramble for the last 3 million. As halvings continue to occur every 210,000 blocks or so, the last coin won’t be minted till 2140.  Bitcoin fees collected reached $1 billion in total earlier this week too, right in time for today’s celebrations.

42403461,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdg4Kk,1572512453,There's a New Way to Get Your Stolen Crypto Back,"“My first loss was with CoinsMarkets. It happened when the exchange closed with our funds. I didn’t even try to contact anyone or alert any police.”  These are the words of an intrepid crypto investor – one of many who responded to a tweet asking about the lack of recourse people face when their assets are stolen in a hack, exit scam or Ponzi scheme.  There’s as much as $10 billion in stolen crypto out there in the market, according to Pawel Kuskowski, CEO of blockchain sleuthing firm Coinfirm. And he wants to give victims a fighting chance at getting their funds back.  Exclusively revealed to CoinDesk, Coinfirm has teamed up with global investigations firm Kroll, a division of consulting firm Duff & Phelps. The joint initiative being launched is called ReclaimCrypto, and combines the latest blockchain forensic techniques with the more established world of legal investigation and asset recovery.  Kuskowski told CoinDesk:  “So far, there is no one place where victims can go and get help. It's almost like they are pleading to get someone interested in their case. In the end, they have to work it out themselves; see about getting a lawyer, perhaps in some other jurisdiction.”  Figures on what is recoverable vary. For instance, CipherTrace, another analytics firm recently said some $4 billion in crypto has been lost this year. Kuskowski’s estimate includes historic (and as yet unresolved) events like Mt Gox, which in today’s money would account for about $1 billion.  Needless to say, Kuskowski and his team are not doing this only for the good of mankind – there are success fees levied on a case-by-case basis, he told CoinDesk, adding:  “Doing the market analysis for this product, we started by calculating the kind of top cases, where we know we could be successful and recover funds, which was about 200 cases.”  Those cases alone account for roughly $1.5 billion, Kuskowski added.  How it works  Coinfirm’s bread and butter is anti-money laundering (AML) within crypto networks, done by analyzing the history of transactions using various smarts and big-data analytics. Similar to the likes of Chainalysis and Elliptic, it works with 50 or so exchanges and has built up a large database in this area.  Coinfirm’s partner, Kroll, takes a more “traditional” approach, which might involve producing court orders to get an internet service provider to reveal details about an IP address, or using former FBI and CIA operatives to scour the dark web for activity involving stolen funds.  Read More: What Should We Do With Stolen Bitcoins?  It should be pointed out that Kroll is not new to crypto: The firm worked with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last year in relation to fraudulent coin offerings. Kroll also tells CoinDesk it helped track down the perpetrators in Europe of $27.8 million bitcoin theft.  If loss victims so choose, Kroll can potentially line up third-party litigation funding. This means firms that provide specialized finance to the legal market, such as Burford Capital or Therium, will shoulder the cost of people’s litigation. For this, they take about 30 percent of the recovered funds and return the rest to the victims.  Benedict Hamilton, a managing director at Kroll, told CoinDesk:  “From a victim's point of view, where the police have failed to recover that money, they are not having to spend anything to get something. And no one recovers funds on their behalf without their permission. It makes the whole economics of recovering stolen funds very different – which is very exciting.”  Referring to Coinfirm as “a torch shining on the blockchain,” Hamilton said this can be extended by Kroll into the murky depths of the dark web. Kroll Cyber runs a specialist darkweb unit out of Pittsburgh, Pa., which is overseen by Keith Wojcieszek, the former head of the criminal investigations unit of the U.S. Secret Service’s cyber division.  This operation crunches petabytes of dark web data from peer-to-peer sites, said Hamilton, adding:  “With the ReclaimCrypto initiative in mind we have have been able to repurpose it so we can go into that database with a wallet string and look for any identifiers that are associated with that wallet name – perhaps a conversation over the selling of stolen credit cards or someone offering criminal services and providing that wallet as an address.”  Follow the money  Hamilton explained that there are two paths that can be followed when it comes to a crypto investigation: figure out who did it or follow the money.  ReclaimCrypto’s objective here is asset recovery, first and foremost, since that’s what the client is paying for. But ultimately both paths lead to the same place, said Hamilton, adding:  “It is inconceivable that the investigative process would finish without us giving all the details to relevant law enforcement for them then to get the benefit of the work and lock the thieves up.”  The majority of ReclaimCrypto’s focus will be on bitcoin and ether, but will also cover XRP, BCH, LTC, NEO and DASH. Unfortunates who have lost assets can learn more here.  As for those who’ve had coins pilfered, some remain philosophical about it. “That's life,” said the aforementioned investor, adding:  “It made me grow a lot and it’s part of my adventure in crypto.”  Cybercrime image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/31/theres-a-new-way-to-get-your-stolen-crypto-back,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6bf29ef14a5428b16a53882583378dbf7fae0ea7-1500x854.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Based on a CoinDesk Korea report on Wednesday and notes from a conference on payments held on Tuesday in Seoul, Hong Kyung-sik, director of financial settlement at the central bank, argued that in Korea, as in most advanced economies, there is very little need for a CBDC.  ""In Korea, we already have advanced payment and settlement infrastructure. In addition, the degree of openness is also internationally high,"" Hong said, according to conference notes published on the central bank's website.  Money can be moved quickly, cheaply and safely in the country utilizing app-based solutions and by bank remittance, and purchases can be settled efficiently with credit cards, Hong added. Open banking is also being developed in Korea, with APIs allowing for seamless connections to and between financial institutions.  ""The possibility that CBDC issuance will soon become a reality in major countries is still small,"" Hong noted.  That said, the central bank official admitted a CBDC might make some sense in developed countries for achieving a few very specific goals, such as the systems being built out in Scandinavia to avoid monopolization and to maintain the resilience of the relevant infrastructure.  On the other hand, developing countries with poor infrastructure might find a CBDC useful to improve inclusion and lower costs associated with the handling of cash, he said. For China, a central bank digital currency could support monetary policy and help promote the internationalization of the renminbi, Hong added.  He said that the central bank will continue to look at blockchain-related technologies and monitor CBDC developments globally but added the institution would be prudent in adopting new solutions.  ""The Bank of Korea should promote and support innovation in payment and settlement. Every effort should be made to achieve a balance between efficiency and safety,"" he concluded.  The Bank of Korea has long been skeptical of CBDCs and in the past has expressed concern about the development of these currencies. In a paper published by the bank in February, it was suggested that a CBDC could crowd out commercial banks and drain them of their funds, destabilizing the banking system.
