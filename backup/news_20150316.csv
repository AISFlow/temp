42378092,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7M2Gf,1426544656,Gyft to Embrace ‘Radical’ Blockchain Concept in Gift Card Fraud Fight,"Gyft CEO Vinny Lingham has announced plans for his mobile gift card company to use bitcoin to enable gift card providers to issue more secure, consumer-friendly digital products.  Announced at the annual SXSW conference, the news was revealed during a conference panel that sought to address the real-world applications of bitcoin, and included Boost VC CEO Adam Draper; Chain founder Adam Ludwin; and ChangeTip CEO Nick Sullivan.  Currently in the R&D stage, the technology standard would “tokenize” gift cards, allowing gift cards to be transferred between peers and other digital wallets by using colored coins, or bitcoin tokens, issued on the bitcoin blockchain.  Lingham went on to suggest the standard would enable gift card numbers to change so that they were less susceptible to physical theft or tampering, something he called the project’s “radical” innovation.  Still, he cautioned that the plan is still far from fruition, telling CoinDesk:  “We’re months away from having a viable prototype, but we think it’s going to be good for the industry and great for consumers.”  The development is the latest for the mobile gift card provider, which became one of the earliest e-commerce platforms to accept bitcoin in May 2013. Lingham has since emerged as an outspoken advocate for bitcoin in the business community, having launched two unsuccessful bids for the Bitcoin Foundation board of directors.  Lingham said he has filed patents for related technology that will be revealed when the project is released.  Blockchain opportunity  The announcement is also the latest vote of confidence extended by Lingham to the wider crypto 2.0 movement in the bitcoin space.  In addition to his duties at Gyft, Lingham serves as an advisor for decentralized application crowdfunding platform Koinify. Further, he recently invested in blockchain-based ID authentication service Trustatom.  Lingham explained that he sees the open ledger as the core innovation behind bitcoin, and the bitcoin blockchain as currently the strongest available. Gift cards, he said, could be issued on the bitcoin blockchain, which would help to certify and validate the data.  ""One bitcoin could be used to issue thousands of gift cards for a value greater than what the bitcoin is,"" Lingham explained. ""We can use this technology to make sure that consumer gift cards are protected, that counterparty risk is managed and that it’s compliant.""  Lingham stressed that in this way the blockchain could be used to limit the fraud risk consumers face, while removing the need for those assets to be tied to bitcoin and its fluctuating price.  No ‘industrial use case’  Lingham went on to state that the standard will help create a use case for bitcoin that could then in turn help to stabilize its notoriously volatile price.  “There’s no industrial use case of bitcoin,” Lingham explained. “There’s no reason for anyone to have a bitcoin. What do you do with it? You can send money back and forth, sure. But it’s not like diamonds that can be used for cutting or gold that can be used in wiring.""  The CEO said that, going forward, bitcoin will need more use cases that seek to utilize its possibilities outside of value transfer, a market that can provide a reason for bitcoins to be taken out of circulation that goes beyond speculation.  “Bitcoin becomes even more valuable when people are using bitcoin without knowing that they're using bitcoin. I think it becomes better for the industry,” he concluded.

42378079,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7M22p,1426536936,Bitcoin Nanosatellites Could Orbit Earth in 2016,"An ambitious plan to launch bitcoin-enabled microsatellites has taken a step forward with a new business deal.  Dunvegan Space Systems  , a startup led by bitcoin core developer Jeff Garzik has signed a manufacturing contract with Deep Space Industries (DSI) that will find it constructing 24 nanosatellites for its proposed BitSat program.  The BitSat cluster will act as space-bound bitcoin nodes and is the first of a planned series of nanosatellites. Additional BitSats will be available for purchase at $1m apiece, according to the company.  Garzik told CoinDesk the launch phase of the project will begin sometime after the first quarter of next year, noting that ultimately, the goal is to create resources capable of propagating the blockchain in a self-sufficient manner.  He explained:  ""When the satellite is capable of fully processing the blockchain, it does not need to trust a ground station to send it authentic data. The satellite itself is capable of making that evaluation, that decision on its own.""  The partnership between the two companies was announced in April.  At the time, the two firms announced the collaboration on the BitSat program but details were limited regarding pricing or when the nanosatellites would be launched.  Cubesats for the blockchain  The cubesats are being pitched as a platform for space-based cloud computing, according to the promotional materials for the BitSat program.  ""DSS handles the spacecraft, launch and ongoing mission operations during the five-year lifespan of the satellite,"" Garzik told CoinDesk. ""This is a large cost reduction from traditional satellites, thanks to the cubesat form factor.  In a statement, DSI chief executive Daniel Faber said that the interests of his company are broadly aligned with those of Dunvegan, noting:  “DSI’s long-term goal of harvesting space resources is well known, and our first steps involve developing nimble, low cost spacecraft that turn out to be very similar to the needs of Dunvegan.""  The initial deployment stage will see four satellites placed into orbit, with the rest of the array being deployed over time. Once all 24 satellites are deployed, Garzik said, the system will be capable of providing ""continuous global coverage"".

42378087,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7M2Bd,1426531691,Factom Announces Launch Date for Token Crowdsale,"Factom has announced it will launch its forthcoming crowdsale on 31st March at 15:00 UTC.  Billed as a “software sale”, the event will allow consumers to exchange bitcoins for Factom tokens that will be available upon the blockchain-based recordkeeping network’s beta release.  Factom president Peter Kirby indicated that final launch date was set after his company met key objectives, including a certain threshold of confidence in its beta version as well as the finalization of milestones with decentralized application crowdfunding platform Koinify.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Kirby spoke about the challenge Factom faced when seeking to orchestrate the sale, voicing his optimism that the project would avoid the pitfalls of those held in the past on platforms such as Mastercoin.  Kirby said:  “We wanted to run the cleanest software token sale in history. We don’t want our customers to be caught up in that regulatory concern. It’s a new asset class, so we have to make sure we’re abiding by all the rules, but watching out for the rules that don’t exist yet.”  Crowdsale funds will be released in installments of 33%, with Factom being able to obtain a portion of its funds upon the release of its beta client, its front-end and peer-to-peer consensus mechanism, respectively.  The Koinify platform requires companies to set benchmarks, serving as the arbitrator between the public and decentralized applications. The crowdsale is the second such event to be held on Koinify following the inaugural sale of GetGems tokens launched in December.  The news comes amid a steady stream of announcements for Factom, which has recently signed partnerships with industry service providers such as Coinapult, Serica (formerly DigitalTangible) and Tether.  Compatibility challenge  Kirby went on discuss the issue posed by working with Koinify, which leverages the Counterparty protocol to conduct its sales.  Factom had originally intended to use the Omni protocol, an alternative layer that allows tokens to be issued on top of the bitcoin blockchain. However, it decided to leverage its own technology to forge a solution.  “Originally we were going to release a proxy token, but we’re going to be issuing our own token on the Koinify platform that runs on Factom. It’s no longer an Omni project or a Counterparty project, it really does live on its own,” Kirby said.  Kirby went on to say the “whole point” of Factom was to focus on distributed ledgers, a factor the lead to the decision to release the tokens on top of its own protocol.  He continued stating that he expects the token to be exchangeable between peers when the beta platform is released, with exchanges then having the ability to decide whether to list the asset for trading.  Bitcoin only  To make purchases on the Koinify platform, customers will need to first purchase bitcoin. Bitcoins will then be sent to a public Factom address, which will contain the purchaser’s public key in a data field.  “When the Factom blockchain launches, the information embedded in all these bitcoin transactions will be used to generate the Factom tokens and load them into the purchasers’ wallets automatically,” the release states.  Factom said it will not be taking customer information as part of the sale, a process that will be mirrored by Koinify, which stressed it does not accept or transmit virtual currency, control bitcoin addresses or hold public keys as part of the sale.  “Koinify's job is to make sure that the best practices as far as the accountability (milestones) and transparency of this sale are followed and implemented in the crypto field and we do not desire nor need to control funds or currencies,” the company said.  Both parties indicated that more details would be released ahead of the launch.  Further Reading: Download our Cryptocurrency 2.0 research report.

Wiper CEO Manlion Carelli confirmed the news, explaining to CoinDesk that the removal was a direct result of its bitcoin integration, which happened earlier this month.  He said:  ""We were removed from the iOS App Store in China due to violating that App Store's policies. Apple explained to us by phone that this violation was related to Wiper enabling bitcoin payments.""  Carelli said that he understood Apple's position and that he hoped to bring Wiper's full service to China ""as the situation around crypto becomes clear"".  Confusion around bitcoin  The news follows on from Apple's removal of the Blockchain wallet app from its iOS App Store, which left iPhone and iPad users without a native bitcoin wallet option for their devices last year.  The tech giant later clarified its bitcoin policy and reinstated a number of apps, including Blockchain.  The policy shift resulted in the approval of SaruTobi, a retro-styled iOS game that tips players in real bitcoin, releasing it onto the iTunes store in January.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC,Yessi Bello Perez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/03/16/bitcoin-enabled-chat-app-wiper-removed-from-chinas-ios-store,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
42378077,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7M1z3,1426519624,Former OKCoin Product Manager Joins Bitfinex,"Former OKCoin manager of international operations Zane Tackett has announced he will join Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange Bitfinex.  Tackett became the latest public-facing figure to resign from OKCoin on 10th March. At the time, he cited a “difference of opinion” as well as “unsolved problems” facing the exchange as motivating factors.  Tackett revealed  his position at Bitfinex will be familiar, as he will take over community outreach and product development, roles he also played at OKCoin. Further, he discussed some of the challenges facing the USD bitcoin trading leader, arguing the exchange must not stay complacent given the competition in the sector.  Tackett told CoinDesk:  “I think the best way to gain users is to interact with them and offer the best exchange in the world, and that's what I'll be looking to do at Bitfinex.”  The announcement notably follows the departure of OKCoin’s CTO Changpeng Zhao last month, and comes amid signs the exchange is shifting focus away from international trading.  Bitfinex is currently the market leader in USD bitcoin trading, according to data from Bitcoinity, trading 1.2m BTC over the last 30 days. By contrast, OKCoin is the number two exchange in both USD and CNY trading, trailing BTC China in its home market.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/03/16/former-okcoin-product-manager-joins-bitfinex,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
42378096,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7M2Lh,1426515619,Berlin's Coyno Launches Bookkeeping Tool for Bitcoin,"A Berlin startup hopes to become the Mint.com of bitcoin with a user-interface that visualises transactions and holdings across a variety of wallets.  The startup, called Coyno, has released a beta version of its platform, allowing users to connect wallets from Coinbase, Electrum, Trezor and three other wallet providers.  Once wallets are connected to Coyno, users can see a chart displaying the 'net worth' of all the linked wallets over time, a list of all transactions performed across the wallets and a breakdown of holdings in the various storage platforms.  Co-founder Erasmus Hagen said the improved design is key for greater adoption of bitcoin, and that's where he hopes his firm will find a niche.  Hagen said:  ""[Current] wallets are nice, but just look at a bitcoin address. When I look at my phone wallet, it's impossible to remember what [transactions] happened at the time unless I write it down. Just to have a graphical representation, to help you use bitcoin the right way, is going to be absolutely crucial to mainstream adoption.""  Exited an accelerator  Coyno is a three person team comprising Hagen, co-founder Levin Keller and technology lead Leopoldo Godines. The startup won entry to the Axel Springer Plug and Play Accelerator in Berlin last November, leaving the programme three months later.  The startup received €25,000 as part of the programme, money that Hagen says has been spent on building the beta. The team is now bootstrapping the project.  Hagen says the idea for Coyno developed when co-founder Keller ran into difficulty compiling the records necessary to file his taxes for his bitcoin holdings.  In Germany, capital gains taxes are levied on bitcoin holdings if they are sold at a profit. The difficulty arises when gathering the records of bitcoin transactions, Hagen said.  ""It was just impossible to do,"" Hagen said.  Hagen says Coyno's current product acts as a ""bookkeeper"" for bitcoin holdings, but the plan is to introduce a tax reporting feature so that users can solve the very problem that inspired the firm in the first place.  Coyno will operate on a 'freemium' model, probably charging for features such as tax reports in future, Hagen said.  Tax reporting plans  Tax reporting will put Coyno in competition with software like LibraTax, which provides accounting software to ease the difficulty of filing taxes for digital currencies accurately in the US. Other software providers like Bitcoin Taxes offer a service for calculating an individual's cryptocurrency tax liabilities.  However, Hagen says tax accounting will comprise just one product in Coyno's planned ""suite"" of digital currency analytics software.  ""Tax is a first step,"" he said.  The firm currently has 150 users in its beta, but Hagen hopes to increase this by tenfold within a month.  Hagen said Coyno has an advantage over other bitcoin startups because it never handles users' private keys or their funds. The firm therefore doesn't have to dive into the thicket of regulations around anti-money laundering (AML) or know-your-customer (KYC) rules, or obtain financial licenses from regulators.  ""We never touch your private keys. You can do a lot of cool things [in bitcoin] without ever having to control people's funds,"" he said.  The Coyno co-founder said Germany suffers from a paucity of investment dollars for bitcoin startups. He pointed to the sole venture-backed bitcoin startup in the country at the moment, a firm called Bitbond, which raised $270,000 last August from Point Nine Capital and Nelson Holzer, according to the CoinDesk bitcoin venture capital database.  ""The Germans are very conservative,"" Hagen said. ""If they can drive it, if they can manufacture it, they will do it ... But to take the lead in something so innovative, they just don't have that kind of imagination. It has been quite difficult.""

42378078,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7M21Z,1426511554,BitGo Update Expands Security Controls for Consumers,"Multi-sig wallet provider BitGo has announced a series of updates, enabling consumers to access security controls previously limited to enterprises.  The bitcoin security company has now added multi-user bitcoin wallets, a series of risk controls including spending limits and the ability to 'whitelist' bitcoin addresses.  The user upgrade has also seen the addition of ""key features requested by enterprise customers"", including secure wallet sharing, address labelling and advanced auditing capabilities.  Will O’Brien, CEO at BitGo, said:  ""BitGo's mission is to secure the world's bitcoin and we are incredibly excited to offer the security controls and capabilities of BitGo free to all individual holders of bitcoin.""  By updating its commercial pricing policy, BitGo is also offering its services for free to individual users and allowing businesses to enjoy a free month's trial.  Rising competition  BitGo released the first multi-sig bitcoin wallet in August 2013.  Competition in the space has since risen, with many bitcoin companies such as BitPay, Circle and Coinbase embracing the security feature.  Gavin Andresen, the chief scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation, said that 2014 was the year of the multi-sig wallet during his speech at Amsterdam's Bitcoin conference.  Multi-signature wallets are the equivalent of safe deposit boxes. They allow multiple parties to partially seed a bitcoin address with a public key.  This means that individuals wanting to spend bitcoin need some of these people to sign their transaction. The necessary number of signatures is agreed when the user creates their bitcoin address.  Funding rounds  The news comes after the bitcoin security provider secured various rounds of funding throughout last year, including a $12m investment led by Redpoint Ventures.  More recently, the bitcoin security specialist announced a new partnership with Innovation Insurance Group and XL Group, enabling it to offer $250,000 in theft insurance to customers who opted in to the program.
