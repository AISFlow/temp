Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Bitcoin broke above $44,000 as short-term holders profited for the first time since November.  Technician's take: BTC has confirmed a break above its two month-long downtrend.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $43,906 +3.4%  Ether (ETH): $3,147 +3.4%  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector XRP XRP +21.8% Currency Polygon MATIC +18.7% Smart Contract Platform Ethereum Classic ETC +11.3% Smart Contract Platform  Top Losers  There are no losers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Markets  S&P 500: 4,483 -0.3%  DJIA: 35.091 +1.3%  Nasdaq: 14.015 -0.5%  Gold: $1,820 +0.6%  Market moves  Bitcoin (BTC) broke above a key price level at $44,000 as bitcoin short-term holders earned profits for the first time since late November.  At the time of publication, the oldest cryptocurrency was changing hands at $43,906, up 3.4% during the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data.  Bitcoin got another price boost on Monday after more than 11% price gains last Friday. The last time bitcoin gained by more than 11% in a 24-hour period was in June, according to data from TradingView and Bitstamp.  As CoinDesk reported, about $71 million flowed into bitcoin-focused funds last week, the largest amount since early December.  As bitcoin’s price increased, coins that were spent and younger than 155 days, or those coins owned by short-term holders (STH), realized profits on aggregate for the first time since late November, according to blockchain data firm Glassnode.  Since March 2020, the market has managed to “break into a bullish uptrend” once the short-term holders broke into profitability, Glassnode wrote in its newsletter on Monday.  In the broader cryptocurrency market, prices of most tokens also rallied on Monday. Ether, the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading at $3,147, up 3.4%in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data.  At the time of writing, polygon (MATIC), the token of scaling systems project Polygon, was leading the latest price rally, up by almost 20% in the past 24 hours, according to Messari. The project announced on Monday that it raised $450 million in a round of funding led by Sequoia Capital India.  Technician's take  Bitcoin's Rally Faces Initial Resistance at $45K-$47K, Support Is at $40K  Bitcoin (BTC) maintained support above $40,000 over the weekend and is up 6% over the past 24 hours.  The cryptocurrency was trading at around $44,200 at press time and has confirmed a break above its two month-long downtrend.  The intermediate-term outlook has become less bearish for BTC given the recent price bounce. That means buyers could remain active toward the next level of resistance of $45,000 to $47,000. At that point, a brief pullback is to be expected after retracing 38% of the prior downtrend.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is not yet overbought, which leaves additional room for price gains this week. Buying activity has stalled over the past few weeks after the RSI first signaled oversold conditions on Dec. 10.  Still, momentum signals remain negative on the weekly and monthly chart, indicating some caution behind the latest price rally.

This has been a long time coming given how low the digital asset had gotten following the market crash. It is a significant point to cross in the road to another bull rally. One thing though, is that the cryptocurrency still has a long way before it is back in bull territory, which market analyst Justin Bennett puts at the $45,000-$46,000 level. As the market tries to work its way towards this bull trend, there are also signals that suggest that a bull rally is not the only likelihood in the near future of the digital asset. In fact, bitcoin recently tripped a trigger that suggests that the market is likely to fall into another crash before bulls can take proper hold of the values. Bitcoin Falls Below 50-Day Moving Average Indicators like the moving average and simple moving average can often point investors and traders towards the next steps in the market. For the longest time, bitcoin continued to trade above its 50-day moving average, suggesting a continuation of the bull rally, which has mostly been the case.

42394551,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwBjRr,1644273857,What Can You Actually Do in the Metaverse in 2022?,"The metaverse is often couched in such futuristic terms that it’s difficult to understand how you can get involved in it today. But the truth is, metaverse-like worlds have been around for decades and it’s possible you will have already experienced some of them without necessarily being aware of it.  What is the metaverse again?  Drawing on venture capitalist Matthew Ball’s framework, the metaverse is a persistent, online world that blurs the lines of reality and virtual reality. Far more than a Call of Duty match, the metaverse refers to a 24/7 online world, inhabited by economies that incentivize a new network of creators and infrastructure providers. Crucially, this economy revolves around in-game assets that are interoperable. This concept diverges greatly from the “walled gardens” – closed ecosystems – of which we’re used to today; Ball provides the example of a skin for a CounterStrike gun that could easily be turned into a decoration for a Fortnite weapon.  While Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta (formerly Facebook) has its own ideas about the metaverse, the cryptocurrency community thinks blockchain technology is a perfect fit for this novel online world. Crypto games like The Sandbox and Decentraland offer early visions of how a creator-led, crypto- and NFT-powered economy could function. So, here’s what you can do in the metaverse today.  Read More: What Is Web 3 and Why Is Everyone Talking About it?  Build, explore and play in virtual worlds  Games like Minecraft and Roblox have been providing metaverse-like experiences for the better part of a decade; both Second Life and Eve Online have been alive and kicking since 2003, and World of Warcraft sprang to life in 2004.  Second Life is one of the closest metaverse analogs due to its creator-led economy and sprawling sandbox world. You can do anything you like in Second Life, and some people have been documented to spend their lives in the game, living off the virtual land, harvesting the game’s in-game currency, Linden dollars, and attending events.  In the 2020s, crypto games like The Sandbox and Decentraland are tilting the videogame economy on its head by adding digital assets to the mix. Not only can you import your own non-fungible tokens (NFT) into the games and buy virtual land, but you can also use the games’ fungible governance tokens to alter the parameters of the virtual world you’ll inhabit, explore and build.  Both are powered by cryptocurrencies – The Sandbox uses fungible SAND tokens as in-game currency and uses NFTs to represent parcels of land and other game-native items, the kinds of assets that decorate your avatar, and Decentraland has fungible MANA tokens and equivalent non-fungibles for virtual assets.  To create accounts, you need only connect a crypto wallet such as MetaMask. Though, in Decentraland it is possible to play as a guest without connecting a crypto wallet. The Sandbox is technically in alpha (testing phase), and the first season has closed, so you can’t play it until the Alpha Season 2 is released, the date of which has not been confirmed.  Crypto-economics aside, these games play like any other sandbox game. You can roam around the games’ respective virtual worlds, hanging out with the brands and celebrities that are rushing to corner the market. In virtual spaces, like shopping malls, art galleries or plazas, you can walk around and speak to people, play games, build houses or attend events. Decentraland even hosts its own music festivals. Unfortunately, despite the advancements in modern computer game graphics many of these newer games look no better than Second Life did back in 2003. But the magic is, at least in theory, in the relationships you can forge with your virtual brethren.  Read More: Who’s Using the Metaverse? Poker Players in Decentraland  Meet people from anywhere for work or play  There are plenty of hangout spaces in the metaverse. While you can certainly congregate in huge open worlds like The Sandbox and Decentraland, you can also play around with custom-built rooms on platforms like Spatial. These apps are purpose-built for events, conferences and meetings. You can log into Spatial with a Web 2 login like Google, or with a Web 3 login like MetaMask. Spatial’s virtual worlds are separated into rooms; you can either visit pre-built rooms or create your own. Spatial’s galleries support NFTs. You can move about Spatial’s world on mobile, Steam, on a browser or through an Oculus VR headset.  Virtual reality is strong on one of Ball’s criteria for the metaverse: presence. Strap on a VR headset, like an HTC Vive, Valve Index or Meta (formerly Oculus) Quest, and launch yourself into cyberspace. Meta (formerly Facebook) is building a social hub for its VR headsets, and Steam’s VR software comes preinstalled with a virtual home. Games like VR Chat pre-dated crypto, and allow you to enter rooms full of other people wearing VR headsets, dressed in whatever avatar they like.  Companies like MetaHub are creating virtual hangout spaces for conferences and business events, and Decentraland hosted its first music festival in 2021 – although artists were doing that in Second Life long before it was cool. Hanging out is where the boundaries of the metaverse can start to blur and the marketing spiel begins to unravel.  Is Zoom a fundamental part of the metaverse because of its track record of connecting workplaces and sparking a work-from-home revolution? Or is it, as Mark Zuckerberg mentioned in his Meta keynote, an unconvincing alternative to reality that replaces in-person interaction with rows of faces on screens?  Create a 3D avatar that looks like you … or not  Your avatar is a big part of your metaverse identity. For some, profile-picture NFTs like CryptoPunks or the Bored Ape Yacht Club are sufficient for Discord and Twitter, mostly text-based platforms where a 2D picture is good enough. For 3D realms, apps like Ready Player Me offer composable digital identities that, it claims, can be used in 1,330 apps and games, including Nike’s RTFKT, Somnium Space and VR Chat. You could also buy a NFT sneaker from RTFKT, or an avatar from its upcoming “Avatar project,” although it’s unclear which games will let you “wear” these.  In Somnium Space, an Ethereum-based virtual reality open world similar to Decentraland, you can import a Ready Player Me avatar created from nothing more than a selfie. Following Ball’s framework, this fulfils the criteria of interoperability – the ability to take your digital assets with you no matter which platform or app you are using.  Invest in virtual land, NFTs or tokens  Of course, if you’re not actually interested in parting with reality just yet, you could always invest in the buzzy virtual worlds instead. There are many ways of going about this. You could invest in NFT avatar drops, like those offered by Nike or Adidas. You could speculate on virtual land or in-game items, like those offered on Axie Infinity, Decentraland and The Sandbox.  You could also invest in the fungible tokens offered by those games, which function as in-game currency. If you’re not sure in which token to invest, you could always invest in a metaverse index fund, such as the Metaverse Index (MVI) offered by Index Coop. The MVI rebalances its portfolio in accordance with the largest metaverse coins of the day.  If crypto isn’t your thing, you could invest in the equity of virtual reality and metaverse companies. Meta is one company betting big on the future of virtual and augmented reality – an analyst on Seeking Alpha estimates that the company will have spent $70 billion on the concept between 2014 and 2023. Virtual reality and metaverse stocks, as well as private investments, are also on the table.

On Monday, Aave founder Stani Kulechov announced the launch of Lens, what he described on Twitter as an “open, composable [Web 3] social media protocol to allow anyone to create a non-custodial social media profile and build new social media applications.”  The launch comes at a time when permissionless social media platforms are once again a hot topic of debate. Over the weekend, Ethereum Name Service core team member Brantly Millegan was removed after old posts condemning transgenderism and homosexuality were resurfaced on Twitter.  Read more: Ethereum Name Service Removes Core Team Member Brantly Millegan Over 2016 Tweet  The episode launched a heated debate about the nature of censorship in Web 3.  In the case of Lens, interoperability and composability will be key features of the new platform. According to the Lens website, the protocol’s name comes from Lens Culinaris, a “tall, branched plant” that has “a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria. If the roots are left in the ground, they will provide a source of nitrogen for its neighbor.”  In much the same way, Lens serves as a platform on which developers can hypothetically build a wide range of applications – all while growing on and drawing on a shared base of users.  “The cool part is that every app will expand the social graph, essentially there is less need for developers to growth hack for users, instead the focus can be shifted towards better and more humane user experience,” said Kulechov in an interview with CoinDesk.  Read more: Twitter Data Scientist Leaves for Aave as DeFi Social Media Plans Simmer  According to the Lens website, the protocol allows users to create NFT-based profiles that can store posts, publications and follower history; revenue-sharing features for content hosted on IPFS; it also has built-in governance for groups of mutual followers. The protocol is built on Polygon, the blockchain that just raised $450 million in a token sale.  According to the Lens website, a grants program for developers who want to build applications on the protocol is currently open, and a homebrewed social app designed to demonstrate how the platform might be leveraged is “coming soon.""

42416751,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulXxjr,1644268773,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Rally Strengthens as Trader Sentiment Improves,"Bitcoin (BTC) rallied above $43,000 on Monday, retracing about 30% of the sell-off since November. Some analysts expect the short squeeze rally could continue, albeit with less momentum compared with previous price surges.  Trading volume across major BTC exchanges ticked higher on Monday, but is still lower than January highs. Below-average trading activity during price rallies typically reflects low conviction among traders.  Volatility is also low in the bitcoin options market despite the price rally. ""Volatilities remain under tremendous pressure in spite of the fast rally in the BTC spot market,"" QCP Capital, a Singapore-based crypto trading firm wrote in a Telegram chat. ""BTC 1-week implied volatilities traded close to the lows of 50% over the weekend! Levels have come up slightly now,"" QCP wrote.  For now, technical indicators show additional room toward resistance at $45,000-$47,000. Bitcoin is testing its 50-day moving average after an oversold bounce left support intact around $37,400, according to Katie Stockton, managing director at Fairlead Strategies. ""We would tread carefully, however, due to bitcoin’s loss of long-term momentum,"" Stockton wrote in a Monday note.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $44034, +5.97%    ●Ether (ETH): $3145, +5.50%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4484, −0.37%    ●Gold: $1823 per troy ounce, +0.90%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 1.92%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Funding rates little changed  Bitcoin's average funding rate, or the cost of holding long positions in the perpetual futures market listed on major exchanges, also remains low despite the recent price rally. That could mean leveraged traders are still cautious and have not positioned themselves aggressively during BTC's 13% price jump over the past week.  The funding rate is slightly negative, which means that ""leveraged shorts are likely to get liquidated if prices continue to rally, adding more fuel to this short squeeze,"" QCP Capital wrote.  Liquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position as a safety mechanism due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. That happens primarily in futures trading.  The previous surge in bitcoin funding rates occurred early in 2021, which preceded a near-50% sell-off. This time, however, funding rates have not reached extreme levels, which suggests some traders have been on the sidelines, scarred by significant liquidations in the prior sell-off.  Crypto fund inflows rise  Crypto funds saw inflows of $85 million during the seven days through Friday, according to a report Monday from the digital-asset manager CoinShares. It was the third straight week of net inflows.  About $71 million flowed into bitcoin-focused funds last week, the largest amount since early December.  Despite the overall bullish sentiment, Ethereum-focused funds saw outflows of $8.5 million, which was less than last week’s $26.8 million in outflows but still a sign of an unsteady market.  Altcoin roundup  XRP leads crypto gains: Ripple's XRP token led gains among major cryptocurrencies with an 18% increase to over $0.79. The price surged amid positive sentiment around the court case in which the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleges the blockchain-based payments firm sold XRP as an unregistered security to the public, according to Shaurya Malwa.

The price movement caused more than $11 million in losses to liquidations for traders of SHIB-tracked futures products. Its weekend surge came days after developers unveiled a tie-up with Welly’s, a fast-food chain selling burgers and fries. The partnership involves rebranding Welly’s stores to include Shiba Inu-themed products and imagery, and the issuance of non-fungible tokens (NFT) for customers, developers said. Besides SHIB, Dogecoin (DOGE) is also among the top meme token gainers, adding 13% of returns in the past 24 hours.

The researchers are economics professor Rod Garratt from the University of California, Santa Barbara, along with Michael Lee and Antoine Martin from the New York Fed’s research and statistics group and Joseph Torregrossa from the legal group.  Liquidity issues  In order for stablecoins to remain, well, stable, they are pegged to an asset considered safe, such as the U.S. dollar. According to the analysts, stablecoins tie up assets unnecessarily.  “Tying up safe and liquid assets in a stablecoin arrangement means they are not available for other uses, such as helping banks satisfy their regulatory requirements to maintain sufficient liquidity,” according to the researchers. The use of stablecoins, they said, could lead to shortages of safe and liquid assets.  Tether, the issuer of USDT, the biggest stablecoin by market cap, is known to be one of the largest commercial paper holders in the United States. According to Tether, there's about $78 billion of USDT in circulation.  Stablecoins that don’t tie up liquidity, such as those that are based on algorithms, are seen as risky and less fungible, according to the analysts.  The researchers cite a paper by Gary B. Gorton and Jeffery Zhang in which they argue stablecoins can be compared to private bank notes issued during the ""free banking"" era in the U.S. in the mid-18th century.  “Private bank notes were not fungible and individuals handling them needed to consider whether to accept any particular note at face value,” the analysts said, adding that this history of private bank notes suggests that stablecoins might be subject to the same issues.  Tokenized deposits instead of stablecoins  “Recent analysis has emphasized the benefits of maintaining the centrality of banks in the payment system,” according to the research paper. The authors raise the question of why the central bank would use stablecoins if it could issue tokenized deposits.  ""While a number of practical details would need to be worked out, the principle behind tokenized deposits is straightforward. Bank depositors would be able to convert their deposits into and out of digital assets – the tokenized deposits – that can circulate on a DLT platform. These tokenized deposits would represent a claim on the depositor’s commercial bank, just as a regular deposit does,"" wrote the researchers.  Tokenized deposits would also make use of existing payment infrastructures.  “Customers can exchange these deposits for goods or services using well-functioning existing payments infrastructures,"" the paper noted. ""Merchants receiving these funds through deposit-based payment systems do not worry about the source of these funds; they transfer at par.”",NEGATIVE,USDT,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | USDT | RESEARCH,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/07/ny-fed-stablecoins-are-not-the-future-of-payments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/655ff8e9c555aa5658c6bcce4c30daa2a61005fd-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42416734,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulXwuV,1644263210,"Crypto Mining Stocks Rally as Bitcoin Surges Past $44,000","The stocks of crypto miners continued their rally from their 2022 lows after the price of bitcoin exceeded $44,000 on Monday.  Crypto miners are the most exposed to the movements of the digital currencies they mine, since mining is their main source of revenue and most firms tend to hold on to the mined coins on their balance sheets.  The publicly traded miners, both large and small, have rebounded in February as the price of bitcoin has started to rebound after hitting a 2022 low of around $33,000 in January. Marathon Digital (MARA), one of the largest miners, has risen almost 30% since hitting its Jan. 27 low. Meanwhile, Core Scientific (CORZ), which went public earlier this year and has one of the highest hashrates in the industry, has risen more than 50% since its Jan. 21 low. However, both stocks are still a long way from the peaks they reached in November.  On Monday, shares of Marathon, Core and Riot Blockchain (RIOT), the top three North American mining companies in terms of hashrate, were up 10%, 12% and 8%, respectively.  “We firmly believe current miner valuations have little to do with fundamentals and more due to the lack of institutional buy-in to this relatively obscure new sector,” Wall Street investment bank D.A. Davidson’s analyst Chris Brendler wrote on Monday. He noted that mining is still very profitable with gross margins over 80%, even as the hash price, a measure of daily revenue per terahash of mining computing power ($/TH/day), has fallen to about $0.20 from peak of $0.40.  Moreover, miners seem to have been anticipating a rebound in prices as they have been holding onto most of the bitcoins mined since the start of this year. For example, Marathon, Core Scientific and Riot Blockchain, have all held onto most of their self-mined bitcoins in January, according to their latest production updates.

42394305,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbQxf,1644262214,CBDCs and the Case for the Public Good,"2022 is starting to look like a defining year for the future of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Just a few weeks in and we’ve already seen countries take firm stances for and against the technology – or in the case of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board in its much-anticipated discussion paper released last week, calling for more research and collaboration with the other branches of government. All told, 87 countries are now exploring the development of these digital versions of cash – with 14 in the pilot stage, according to the Atlantic Council’s tracker.  Jason Chlipala is the chief operating officer at the Stellar Development Foundation.  The different needs and concerns of countries will naturally lead to a variety of CBDC designs (or none at all for the countries that opt out for the time being). Faster payment speed, lower costs and more transparent cross-border payments are all being researched as potential benefits of implementation. Financial inclusion has also emerged as a widespread focus of central banks, especially in emerging economies. CBDCs combine the simplicity of physical cash with the reach of electronic money, making them transformational for those without easy access to banks and other digital financial services.  Money is a public good, meaning it is provided without the intention of profit and for the benefit of a society. But money is also technology, with different forms, features and use cases. It’s exciting to see countries around the world look to new innovations, like CBDCs built on blockchain, to make it better. It’s critical that industry players step up to educate decision makers on the considerations at play to successfully develop CBDCs as a meaningful payment option for their citizens and economies. As this process continues, there are three points that all stakeholders, public and private, should keep in mind.  CBDCs don’t have to completely replace cash  Because any CBDC would act like a token and serve as legal tender, cash is the obvious comparison. For this reason, debates around CBDC have sometimes tended toward considering a world where all physical cash has been replaced by CBDCs. While perhaps an interesting thought experiment, that isn’t the case we need to be evaluating.  While CBDCs will supplement the current system, they don’t have to replace it. Even in a world with CBDCs, there will still be demand for physical cash from some consumers in some cases. It’s a matter of providing consumers with options, as different forms of money can serve different needs and individual preferences. The same goes for wires, credit cards and other forms of payment. CBDCs don’t have to solve every payment-related problem; they are worth it if they provide new, useful functionality, especially for those for whom the current system doesn’t always work.  CBDCs don’t have to disintermediate banks  A concern raised by many is the danger of CBDCs disintermediating the commercial banking system. Essentially, the argument goes that if people start pulling their money out of banks and holding it as CBDCs, then the total capital available to banks for beneficial activities like lending will be greatly reduced.  This risk needs to be taken seriously, because credit and other financial services provided by banks are essential to the smooth operation of society. But this concern can be dealt with in a variety of ways, as long as CBDCs are designed thoughtfully.  Read more: John Kiff & Jonas Gross - CBDCs for the People? Where the Current State of Digital Currency Research Leads  For example, a “two-tier system” where banks and other financial institutions issue the asset backed by reserves would mean the capital underlying the CBDC is still sitting in the banking system. Or if a central bank wants to be the issuer of the asset, the programmability of a CBDC means certain limits could be put on balances to ensure capital doesn’t flow out of banks. The flexibility of the underlying technology means that CBDCs can surely be designed to avoid disintermediation.  CBDCs can be issued on open networks  Finally, much of the discussion and research on CBDCs up until now has been around using closed or “permissioned” networks to issue them. This impulse is understandable, because historically making an electronic payments system safe has meant completely controlling the infrastructure on which it’s built (i.e., controlling the databases holding the balances and the messaging for updating those databases). The power of blockchain technology is that asset issuers can now get similar levels of safety and certainty when using common infrastructure.  CBDCs issued on open networks enable more open competition and experimentation. By allowing private sector innovators more direct access to the infrastructure a CBDC is issued on, the technology will lead a wider variety of financial services, especially for those who may be underserved in today’s system. Even if closed-network CBDCs are built with the best intentions for interoperability, they run the risk of returning to the siloed world we experience today.  As we move forward, it’s up to our industry to articulate the value of CBDCs, its greater promise of financial inclusion and improved access to technology that benefits not just for a handful of tech elites, but the overall public good.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Jason Chlipala,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/02/07/cbdcs-and-the-case-for-the-public-good,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c56b6e98b5ac187eba5b62ce690e04c819ad0315-5588x3725.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The &apos;Spent Output Profit Ratio&apos; (or SOPR in short) is an on-chain indicator that tells us whether investors are currently selling at a profit or at a loss. The metric works by checking the history of each coin being sold on the chain to see what price it was last moved at. If the Bitcoin price before was less than the current one, then the coin is considered to have been sold in profit. When the SOPR has values greater than 1, it means holders have been selling at a profit on average. On the other hand, values of the indicator below the threshold imply investors sold at a loss overall during this period.

42394566,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwBkgn,1644259920,5 Social Media Crypto Scams to Avoid,"While social media may not be the number one source of crypto fraud –that would be decentralized finance (DeFi), according to Chainalysis – it’s certainly rife with scams. In December 2022, Metallica had to issue a statement warning fans of crypto social media scams ahead of their new album release:  In 2021, con artists used Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s appearance on ""Saturday Night Live"" to bilk users out of $10 million through fake crypto giveaways on Twitter and YouTube.  A good practice when encountering anything on social media is to be skeptical. Here are some ways to be on the lookout for, and protect yourself from, common social media scams.  1. The classic giveaway scam  The common social media cryptocurrency scam follows a formula. The scammers mimic major brands and/or impersonate celebrities to promote giveaways that promise to double your money if you deposit bitcoin or other crypto assets into a designated wallet address. Of course, this is not what happens, and as soon as you send your cryptocurrency it’s gone forever.  It is worth pointing out there are sometimes legitimate giveaways circulating on Twitter, but take care to do thorough research before you interact in any way with a giveaway.  Your first step can be a simple Google search for the giveaway. When Chipotle did a “Burrito or Bitcoin” giveaway, a simple search for “Chipotle crypto giveaway” will return not only thousands of results, but also dozens of articles from trustworthy publications like USA Today, CoinDesk and CNN. On the other hand, a recent scam using the likeness of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin would have easily been discovered using a search for “Vitalik Buterin Crypto Giveaway."" The results only spoke about the scam, not the promotion.  Next, you want to check the official website to confirm the giveaway. When Chipotle, Coinbase and Cash App did bitcoin giveaways, they all had official blog posts that were easy to find and included terms and conditions of the giveaway.  Finally, make sure you’re checking the actual website. For example, Cash App’s website is cash.app, not cashapp.com. Scammers will take legitimate-looking addresses and create fake pages to fool unsuspecting victims with elaborate and convincing sites.  2. Fake verified accounts  Another common trick con artists use to steal crypto is to take advantage of the trust signals that social media platforms utilize, such as blue checkmarks on Twitter, which now can be bought through Twitter Blue for the low price of $8. If you hover over the checkmark on Twitter, you can tell if the person paid for the check or if it's a ""legacy verified account."" There are also now gold stars that show this ""account is verified because it’s an official business on Twitter.""  Facebook-verified accounts will display a similar message if you hover over the checkmark: “Facebook confirmed this is the authentic profile for this public figure.”  Real accounts on Instagram have similar marks, though no pop-up. But you can check for the number of followers and other signals that an account is the real deal. The real Mark Cuban has 1.7 million followers on Instagram while this fake account has just 31.  This should not be wholly relied upon, however, because there have been instances where hackers have successfully managed to breach Twitter’s security and disseminate crypto giveaway scams through official Twitter accounts belonging to high-profile individuals and companies. These included Kayne West, Barack Obama, Apple and Uber.  Another thing to be wary of is people using Ethereum domains as part of their handles, which many legitimate (but not officially verified) people do. For those of you who aren’t familiar with it, the Ethereum domain name is a way to create a shortcut to share your identity on the Ethereum blockchain. Many well-known figures utilize the .ETH domain including Vitalik Buterin, Andreeson Horowitz investment partner Chris Dixon, non-fungible token (NFT) influencer Farokh Sarmad and even socialite Paris Hilton.  In effect, the .ETH domain name has created semi-verification for people. However, this means more scammers will utilize .ETH handles to feign credibility and defraud investors.  Check out the two photos of social media profiles of Vitalik Buterin below. One is real and the other is fake. Can you tell which one is which?  It’s the Instagram account that’s fake.  When this account was active, it regularly ran cryptocurrency scams. While the fraudster was able to convince 640,000 people to follow the account (though it is also possible the person used bots or bought followers to look legitimate), there were plenty of red flags.  First, it doesn’t have the verification mark. Second, posted stories misspelled “Ethereum” as “Etereum.” Spelling and grammatical errors are often key indications of a scam.  3. Twitter reply scams  As mentioned above, hackers have a history of successfully breaking into Twitter accounts in order to increase the impact of their scams. While the large-scale nature of the 2020 breach was an extremely rare example, hackers often break into smaller verified Twitter accounts and alter them to look like other legitimate accounts.  For example, a scammer hacked the official check-marked account of Troy Stecher, a hockey player for the Detroit Red Wings, modified it to look like the ""Saturday Night Live"" Twitter feed and used it for a scam.  Hackers will also use these verified accounts to reply to other high-profile accounts or viral tweets to gain more exposure. Mahbod Moghadam, who founded Rap Genius and Helladoge, aptly sums up the “reply technique” in social media as “no one reads your tweets, but they read your replies to famous people’s tweets.”  So if you’re reading the replies and see a giveaway or other get-rich-with-quick crypto promotion, it’s 99.9% sure to be a scam.  4. Fraudulent YouTube live videos  One growing crypto scam on social media utilizes YouTube live videos. Researcher Satang Narang reported that in just one month YouTube Live giveaways defrauded $8.9 million out of investors.  With a YouTube Live scam the fraudsters create a live video (often using stolen content), portray themselves as some form of authority in cryptocurrency and post a link to a “giveaway” in the video’s description, where you’ll be asked to send cryptocurrency. By using the Live feature, the fraudsters avoid YouTube’s content review process until the video is over.  As with the other social media scams, the best way to avoid this one is to do your research. Some ways to check if a YouTube channel is legitimate are:  How many videos does the channel have? A channel with only a few videos is suspect.  Does it have YouTube’s gray verification badge?  How long has the channel existed? Go to the About link in the channel’s profile and check the “stats” section to find out when the channel was created. If it’s a brand-new channel, beware.  Is the live video taking up the full screen? Most scam live videos give up half of the screen to promote the link to the giveaway, but a real Live video won’t usually do this.  5. Crypto catfishing  Beware of the new wave of catfishers and fake accounts trying to separate you from your crypto by sliding into your direct messages, or DMs. While sometimes legitimate opportunities can come from DMs, like Busta Rhymes’ finding his NFT designer through Twitter DMs, more often than not DMs lead to scams. If someone DMs you a link and you don’t know them, do not click on that link unless you've done a thorough background check.  We asked Eric Charles from NFT platform Origin Protocol how to filter legit DMs about crypto from fraudulent ones on social media. His advice was, “I tend to assume most [DMs] are scams, but I will view the person’s profile on Twitter. Based on their activity, verification status and when their account was created, I’m able to determine if it looks legit or not.”  With crypto, you have to be especially careful. Unlike a credit card scam where you can dispute transactions and get your money back, whatever amount you send to someone in crypto cannot be disputed to a higher authority. So it’s extra important to do your due diligence and exercise caution.

Crypto funds saw inflows of $85 million during the seven days through Friday, according to a report Monday from the digital-asset manager CoinShares. It was the third straight week of net inflows.  The majority of the inflows come from the Americas, according to CoinShares. Brazil and Canada accounted for 88% of the total inflows last week.  Bitcoin (BTC) has partly recovered some of its steep losses from the first week of 2022, trading at around $43,887 at press time, up from $32,900 just a couple weeks ago. The price is still well off its all-time high of almost $69,000 in November.  About $71 million flowed into bitcoin-focused funds last week, the largest amount since early December.  Despite the overall bullish sentiment, Ethereum-focused funds saw outflows of $8.5 million, which was less than last week’s $26.8 million in outflows. Ether (ETH), Ethereum blockchain’s native cryptocurrency, was up 16% in the past five days, but is still down 2.2% compared with a month ago.  ""Investment products flows for Ethereum suggest investors remain bearish,"" CoinShares wrote. This is the ninth straight week of outflows for Ethereum-focused funds.  Prior to the recent three-week streak of inflows, crypto funds had experienced $532 million in outflows over the prior five weeks.  Crypto funds focused on altcoins like solana, polkadot and cardano all saw inflows. Terra-focused funds saw their first significant inflows last week, totaling $1.4 million, which represented 26% of total assets under management, CoinShares wrote.

42394296,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbQId,1644257958,Of Course It’s OK to Out the BAYC Founders,"This past Friday, BuzzFeed News’ Katie Notopoulos published a story revealing the identities of “Gordon Goner” and “Gargamel” – the two pseudonymous founders of Yuga Labs, the company behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT project.  “Gordon Goner” is Wylie Aronow, a 35-year-old from Florida, and “Gargamel” is Greg Solano, a 32-year-old writer. Buzzfeed made the discovery by going through public business records; Yuga Labs is incorporated in Delaware, with an address tied to Solano.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  We’d already known a little about the founders: In interviews with Rolling Stone, CoinDesk and The New York Times, they’d shared details about their backgrounds (both men had backgrounds in writing, for example) and their path to creating the Bored Apes.  But for some of the biggest crypto influencers and investors, Buzzfeed’s revelation was a bridge too far.  The influencer “Cobie,” formerly known as “Crypto Cobain,” called Notopoulos a “whore for clicks.”  “They’re literally cartoon apes,” wrote the investor Mike Solana, apparently trying to downplay the importance of the subject matter. “There was absolutely no reason to dox these guys. The heroic language being used by journalists to describe this story as if it were some kind of massive scoop in the public’s interest is disgusting.”  Outside of crypto, the word “dox” (usually defined as “publicizing someone’s private information”) specifically connotes harassment; within the space, its meaning is slightly more complicated. Founders will sometimes make a point of doxxing themselves as a show of faith, attempting to convince investors they won’t just run off with their money (this is significantly easier when no one knows who you are).  There’s a strong culture of anonymity, in crypto, which stems from its “cypherpunk” history.  It’s weird, to the uninitiated. Traditional finance reporters pivoting to crypto in the past year have consistently balked at the idea of allowing subjects (not just sources) to remain pseudonymous in stories when it wasn’t absolutely necessary. And it’s part of why, in the public imagination, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have remained so closely associated with misuse and criminality. Why stay anonymous if you have nothing to hide?  Of course, there are plenty of good reasons to stay anonymous even if you have nothing to hide. The premise of crypto is that maybe, if you feel like it, you should be able to send money without handing over your personal details to a bank.  But the Bored Ape Yacht Club founders aren’t just anyone. The Bored Apes have dominated the discourse around NFTs for months, both in and out of the crypto space. At this point, they’re de facto brand ambassadors for crypto collectibles.  The Financial Times recently reported that Andreessen Horowitz, a powerful venture capital firm with billions already invested in crypto, is in talks to buy a major stake in Yuga Labs – financing that would value the company at around $5 billion.  To me, the identity of these two founders is unambiguously a story in and of itself. The BuzzFeed article didn’t do a whole lot with the identities of these two men; Notoupolos admitted they hadn’t done anything wrong, really. But ultimately, Aronow and Solano are at the helm of a business that’s potentially worth billions of dollars. Apes have flooded the market and saturated the culture. Why shouldn’t a journalist go looking for more details?  It’s also worth noting that Notopoulos didn’t come by this information nefariously or unjustly; she found it online, in publicly available business records.  Some reporters have taken the view that doxxing is unnecessary, period, unless the person in question has done something wrong.  There’s often a real risk in outing subjects, particularly ones who stand to face personal danger if their identity is revealed (think: subjects living in Russia, who might be thrown in jail). No reasonable reporter wants to ruin anyone’s life for the sake of a story. And “burning” vulnerable sources has long been considered a cardinal sin.  In a piece for CoinDesk in 2020, Marc Hochstein (my boss and the site’s head of editorial ethics) wrote that “if you’re going to reveal someone’s personal information without their consent, you better have a damn good reason to do it.”  Larry Cermak, a crypto researcher who said he disagrees with BuzzFeed News’ decision to out the BAYC founders, suggested on Twitter that it would be similarly wrong to dox Satoshi Nakamoto, the famously pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin.  See also: Who Is Satoshi Nakamoto?  Again, I have to disagree. Satoshi Nakamoto is inarguably one of the most important people in the history of 21st century finance, and journalists have been trying to out him for years. His stash of bitcoin (now worth tens of billions of dollars) gives him significant control over the markets; he could tank it all in minutes, if he sold. The influence of that stake can’t be overstated. The revelation of Nakamoto’s true identity would be an industry-shaking bombshell about one of the richest and most powerful people in this ecosystem.  Nakamoto’s identity still hasn’t been revealed, mostly because he was incredibly careful about covering his tracks. His personal bitcoin remains untouched. And because he hasn’t cashed out, there’s no real paper trail.  The BAYC founders, on the other hand, incorporated their company in Delaware using a personal address. They weren’t cypherpunks when they created Yuga Labs, they were writers and lay crypto enthusiasts, which is to say they hid themselves more sloppily.  They’re within their rights to remain pseudonymous, but reporters are within their rights to out them, too.  Reporting on the rich and powerful shouldn’t be controversial, from an ethics perspective.

Forcing users to put up more collateral than they seek to borrow is not feasible in the long term. Hashstack solves this issue by bringing undercollateralized loans to decentralized finance. Unlocking The Full Potential of DeFi Lending The concept of decentralized lending and borrowing provides a necessary alternative financial approach. Millions of people have little or no access to traditional financial products and services. The underbanked and unbanked population will be the primary beneficiaries of decentralized finance, but only if the requirements are manageable. In the current lending and borrowing landscape, those requirements make little sense. More specifically, users looking to borrow funds need to put up 150% of the borrowed amount - or more - as collateral. That seems strange, as one traditionally puts up a maximum of 50% of what they want to borrow as collateral when dealing with banks. Moreover, the requirement to have more money than you want to borrow does not appeal to unbanked or underbanked individuals.

42421209,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXgrcL,1644257696,Meet the Man Behind Associated Press' Crypto Strategy,"The Associated Press, a collective of more than 1,300 news organizations, might be the original DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). At least, that’s what the white-haired, New Jerseyan behind its blockchain experiments, Dwayne Desaulniers, has said.  Over the past year, the AP has made newsworthy leaps into the world of blockchain. In October, it partnered with Chainlink Labs to launch a node and push news onto Ethereum. For the U.S. elections in the next month, it worked with decentralized encyclopedia Everipedia to publish and preserve its race calls. And, at the beginning of this year, the AP unveiled a Polygon-based NFT marketplace where it will auction some of its Pulitzer Prize-winning photos.  That’s a lot of activity for a 175-year-old organization, widely regarded as one of the most sober and reliable news organizations left standing. But perhaps it’s not so surprising. The not-for-profit has often been quick on the draw when it comes to technological innovation, Desaulniers said. It was early on the telegraph, television and color photographs – always in search of the best way to get more news out there.  Blockchain, the technological innovation that combines immutable record-keeping and decentralized consensus, was a natural fit. But crypto’s comparatively short, 13-year lifespan is littered with failed media projects. It turns out the colloquial “first draft of history” often needs to be rewritten. (In 2019, for instance, the AP Stylebook, the spelling and grammar guide CoinDesk uses, said “crypto” isn’t proper shorthand for cryptocurrency, but cryptography.)  Desaulniers, who started out as a reporter and transitioned into media business development, is not discouraged. And neither is the cooperatively run media behemoth behind him. Tasked with searching for new ways to generate revenue, crypto, once a $3 trillion industry, was a no-brainer. Micropayments, NFTs and social tokens are all prospective ways for media companies to build businesses.  See also: Associated Press NFT Artwork Sells for $180K in Ether  It’s early days yet and still risky, but the AP is taking it slow. Desaulniers spoke with CoinDesk about the AP’s experiments so far. Blockchain has yet to become a moneymaker, but this may be a useful guide for any yeoman journalists looking to leverage crypto to pay the bills so they can write.  Over the past two years, there have been a few organizations that have dipped their toes into crypto. Like more than just NFT branding experiments, but really engaging with the tech: PayPal, Square, the Associated Press. It always seems like these changes typically come from the agitation of one committed crypto person at a firm. Is that you?  I'm a former journalist as well. In the ‘90s I fell in love with technology and the internet, and I was just, like, “what is this gonna do to news? Is it good? Is it bad?” I've just been working in tech and business development ever since. That was my current role at AP, finding new revenue from non-traditional sources to fund the journalism that we do. In the summer of 2020, I got a call from Everipedia asking if we thought about publishing election data on the blockchain. That started a weeks-long education.  We deployed our API and when we made a race call it hit the node and a few smart contracts – that was the very beginning. We were stunned that this whole environment [crypto] has great difficulty porting data over from the internet. It's like this empty vessel. There's this whole economy that needs good information – that's very much aligned with our core business. We're a news wholesaler, we're not-for-profit, B2B. If we get a sense that there's a community that needs good information, and boy, we should get on that.  Do you have a whole team of researchers, coders and business types?  After we did that election experiment, a lot of colleagues – totally organically – who shared an interest in crypto got involved. It’s an ad hoc band of folks that wanted to understand what this was all about. Somehow in this global company, we all found each other. There's still, like, no real official team. My bosses have said, “you're the guy in charge,” but apart from a title, we don't really have anything official. There’s me from the sales side, a couple people from customer service. Obviously, some of our journalists (photographers in particular) are helping.  The more we looked at it, the more testing and little pilots that we did, the more pleased we were with the results and what we were seeing. Everyone loves the chance to figure out what’s the future of news on this platform called “blockchain.” Where do NFTs and even the metaverse – that's something that we're looking at – come in?  That's where we're at today. We did four NFT drops last year on OpenSea, Ethernity and Binance. We're totally playing the field to learn how is Binance different from OpenSea from our perspective.  What did you find there? Are there quantitative or quantitative metrics you’re looking at to see which platform to use long term?  Number one is: how did the sale go if it's an auction or selling at a fixed price? How much does the marketplace help us with marketing? Would they give us a placement on the carousel? Would they help on Twitter? We did a few AMAs [ask me anything] and observed who was attending. This is not scientific, but we certainly had a very, very strong sense that Binance was heavily exposed in Asia. That was one notable difference. We also asked what the fees were like? Fees were a minimal consideration: We're not greedy, we're sharing money with everybody who's helping us.  It's far more important to get the learning and then figure things out as to whether this is going to be a real, official line of business for us. We sold our first NFT for 100 ether back in March, so that got people internally to pay attention.  That's a windfall.  Yeah, it was unbelievable.  There must be concerns too.  No doubt about that. We’re very concerned about the progression of the technology, especially concerning the environment. For the marketplace that we're going to launch, we're going with Polygon because it's a drastically smaller impact.  This might be projection, but there seems to be widespread skepticism about crypto from professionals outside of the industry, especially among journalists. Did you have to do a lot of convincing internally to get AP photojournalists involved?  The thing we had to do more than anything was education. You know: What is the blockchain? What is an NFT? That was job number one. Even today the knowledge is still broadly very, very, very, very, very low. We just wanted to be thoughtful about what we were doing. We didn't want to just raid the archives and see how much money we could make. We thought if the photo community is growing, and if this technology allows them to feel more confident and secure in acquiring an AP photo, then that's possibly a really good thing.  So that's our approach with photographers: We share revenue and teach them how to set up their wallet so they can take advantage of direct payment and secondary sales. We’re trying to be fair with this new potential market  I was trying to find a tough question to ask a former journalist and was going to ask what an NFT marketplace would mean for news, what are there ethical considerations around individuals owning news photographs, which, in a sense, belong to the world. But that’s not exactly fair, because it ignores the reality that just about every digital news image is already gated by Getty.  Or Shutterstock.  Yeah, exactly. Do you think crypto marketplaces like AP’s NFT app could steal market share from these image monopolists?  Well to answer the original question about news ethics: We don't see the blockchain at this point as a way to distribute our daily news report. It just doesn't work. If we ever have to make a correction to a story; it quickly becomes a mess. For certain things like election race calls – where it’s exceedingly rare to reverse those calls because software and humans are working together to all but ensure the runner-up cannot overtake the winning candidate – we feel much more comfortable putting that type of data on the blockchain.  Blockchain permanence is attractive because it can be broadcasted widely to the public, but no one can mess with, or alter or undo something really, really important. We’re trying to figure out what elements of the technology we can extract and use to further our mission. The mission is to get more AP facts out into the world.  And the second question: All the photos that we will be minting on this marketplace, they've already been sent to all of our members and all of our customers. We're not yet filing anything totally new to the blockchain. We are looking at that, but, at this point, the photos that we're planning to mint are just some of the best news, weather photos, aesthetically, we think we've done in the last few years.  Have you heard of Polymarket?  No.  It's an Ethereum-based predictions market that was recently dinged by the CFTC for offering unlicensed binary options. In my heart of hearts I wanted to see something like it develop into a real web primitive, a way to make bets across the internet to help us resolve the truth or combat fake news by putting a price on truth. A big reach that’s even less realistic now. To some extent, Polymarket is the ideal use case for what the AP is doing by pushing information out to blockchain. Does the regulatory environment limit the impact you can have working with smart contracts?  Publishing information on-chain is probably the most traditional of all our blockchain projects – it’s just distributing information. Working with Chainlink, we basically asked what is the information that’s needed? [Feeding] DeFi is obviously way up there at the top of the list. I’m constantly looking over my shoulder at regulation, watching what's happening there and just, like, checking the vibe. We've had ideas that – let’s say, if the government may be turning sour, we’d just stop. We don't want to get involved with that. We’re mindful of who's using the material.  With regards to sports, which is a large market for us, we had a very big ethical dilemma. About four years ago, some states started to legalize gambling and sports betting. We have a ton of accurate, verified sports data, and it's all technically, beautifully structured. We went back and forth on whether it was ethical to put this stuff out there for betting. Initially, the answer was no, but that changed as more and more jurisdictions opened up and it became a legit business.  We're taking the same approach with trying to understand how smart contracts will use our data that we want to put on our node. When we detect a customer that's interested in a particular data set, we'll have the ability with our systems to be super selective about what stories go where. I see it as an entirely new economy that's missing information. And for a news company like AP that's a pretty sizable, if theoretical, opportunity.  Do you have any projections there?  I wouldn't say it's a formal established line of business because it's so early, there's still so much to learn and there's definitely risk. Honestly, we're not budgeting expected revenue from any of these projects. We could just pull the plug on everything tomorrow.  How profitable has the Chainlink node been?  So total transparency – it's early. It's a combination of waiting to find the right customers that want the data that we've got. That's just going to take some time. I don't think I should share the number, but honestly, Dan, it's just not very much at all at this point. Although we did make money off the election data in 2020 – about $50k. But, you know, that was election data, it was a crazy election, it was globally important, there was a huge amount of attention which is why it was that profitable.  How does business development work – are customers reaching out to the AP or Chainlink, typically?  With Chainlink, we're trying to find customers where we've got a really good match, and then work to get the data to those guys. We publish all information about how to access our node online. I think folks with experience, they hear through marketing that the AP has public data and hook up to our node. But Chainlink also does some matchmaking between industries and companies, so that's primarily how things have been working so far.  What do you make of the litany of failed crypto-media experiments?  There was a really interesting pilot done three years ago called Civil where a bunch of journalists issued a coin that allowed those who had stake to react to news. Theoretically, there would be a community that would be incentivized to engage with stories and check things that were suspicious. It was a lot of fun, and we learned a ton – but the thing was just way too early. Man, I found it super complicated just setting up the wallet and whatnot. Setting aside those mechanics and the operations, it was a really good way to figure out how to use this technology to further our mission.  Going back to the election. Having a tamper-proof dataset that’s broadcasted to clients and the world is all well and good. But there's sort of this “last mile” problem of people actually trusting this information. I don’t know if I should get into all the ways the 2020 election unraveled, but can these blockchain experiments ever actually restore trust – is that possible?  Yeah, you're absolutely right to ask how this tech can actually help us. Take news photography, does the technology allow a news consumer to distinguish more easily a real photo or video from a deep fake? That's a really important use case that a lot of organizations – The [New York] Times, The Washington Post – are interested in. From the position of better facts, fighting fake news, it's one of the best tools I've seen.  Then, on the business side, it’s allowing us to do things we never even imagined. When someone buys an AP photojournalism token, and then sells it, the photographer can also get a portion of that secondary sale. We've never, ever been able to do that before. The licenses that we issued to people to use our photos has been a total dead end. We give you a personal license, you can hang the photo on the wall after it’s printed, but that's it. But NFTs could allow us to actually extend that market and allow the license itself to have some value that can be passed along and traded with profits continuing to come back to photographers and the AP.  See also: The Decentralized Web Has Plans, if Not Solutions  In a way, this technology also helps us build tools to help individuals make better informed choices about what they're reading or what they're looking at – to determine whether it's real or not or misleading.  There’s a lovely quote from a previous interview where you said, “The AP is the mother of all DAOs.” Any plans to migrate AP governance on chain?  No plans, but the parallels are undeniable. The AP is a co-op, it’s member-driven, there are bylaws, a board that represents the whole and makes decisions – it's in our DNA to operate that way. We’re always asking what the co-op will look like if the media landscape continues to change. DAOs came up in an R&D conversation; we compared our 175-year-old governance model to our understanding of a DAO and didn't see a perfect fit, but, boy, there's enough there that we really want to understand.  I doubt a DAO will ever replace the AP, but what might happen is we pick a subset of news – a niche area like statehouse news reporting – and experiment. The DAO model is great for something like that. Sadly, so many statehouse reporters have lost their jobs over the last few years and left the business. There’s information that needs to be in the public domain but is hard to sustain. A DAO could be an interesting solution.  Josh [Quittner] at Decrypt spun up PubDAO – he told me they’re trying for “AP on the blockchain.” Great for Josh, but a little too far, too fast for us. We’ll learn from them.  Any other words of wisdom for media types looking to experiment with crypto?  You know, we're not going into this as experts. We're learning as fast as we can, and as much as we can. We're trying to be creative and make creative uses of the technology. But none of us want to get fired. So we're very, very careful about the decisions we're making and how far we're going. It's going to be a really interesting chapter in terms of being part of the group that figures this stuff out. Is there a role for news on the blockchain? The fact that I get paid for asking that is kind of a bonus.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | LINK | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/02/07/meet-the-man-behind-associated-press-crypto-strategy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6e845e0fc324cdc6a9760b14fc5c16932da954b7-1732x1036.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

From something completely unheard of to a market that&apos;s worth over $40 billion, NFTs have had an incredible year. But what exactly are NFTs, and more importantly, what&apos;s the point of them? While some people think that NFTs don&apos;t have any real purpose, many industries are incorporating them in innovative ways. This is especially true within the gaming industry, which has taken to using NFTs as unique skins, methods of improving the diverse styles of play within gameplay, and digital methods of trading. In this article, we&apos;ll be explaining what NFTs are and breaking down how you can buy one, where they are stored, and the various functions associated with them. Let&apos;s get right into it. What exactly is an NFT? NFTs, which stands for Non-Fungible Tokens, are digital assets that are stored in the blockchain. When a person buys an NFT, they&apos;re buying ownership, with proof of their digital ownership being stored online. Due to the blockchain technology that&apos;s used for this process, which is incredibly secure, NFTs are a safe digital asset and are famously difficult to steal.

Gruenberg became acting chair of the FDIC on Feb. 5 following the resignation of Jelena McWilliams, who had held the post since 2018. Gruenberg had served as an FDIC board member since mid-2018; prior to that, he was the FDIC’s chairman for a five-year term starting in 2012.  “The rapid introduction of a variety of crypto-asset or digital asset products into the financial system could pose significant safety and soundness and financial system risks,” Gruenberg wrote. He noted that it’s “imperative” that federal banking agencies consider the risks posed by these products, and determine how well banking organizations can safely engage in handling them.  “To the extent such activities can be conducted in a safe and sound manner, the agencies will need to provide robust guidance to the banking industry on the management of prudential and consumer protection risks raised by crypto-asset activities,” he concluded.  Other priorities for 2022 included strengthening the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), addressing financial risks posed by climate change, reviewing the bank merger process and finalizing the Basel III Capital Rule.  Separately, the FDIC has still been trying to determine whether stablecoins qualify for pass-through insurance if they are offered by FDIC-approved institutions.

42394353,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbQsX,1644251626,Accounting Standards Are Key to Getting Digital Assets on Corporate Balance Sheets,"The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), which sets accounting standards for private and public U.S. companies, has not developed any accounting standards for digital assets. This has proved to be one of the biggest barriers to the adoption of digital assets.  FASB solicited an “agenda request” in September inviting comments from the public on identifying “pervasive needs” to improve generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and inquiring about potential areas for future accounting standards setting.  Perianne Boring is founder and CEO of the Chamber of Digital Commerce.  The Chamber of Digital Commerce has been advocating the FASB since 2015 on the need for accounting standards for digital assets. Previously, the FASB has pushed back due to perceived lack of “pervasiveness” of digital assets, and therefore did not allocate the resources necessary to develop authoritative guidance on accounting for crypto.  The Chamber of Digital Commerce led a significant response to the FASB’s most recent agenda, providing input from the Chamber’s more than 200 members, as well as insights from congressional leadership and other industry stakeholders. Our intention was to both educate the FASB and its advisory staff on the pervasive impacts of digital assets, as well as to make a strong case for FASB to now undertake standards setting for digital assets.  If you are wondering what adoption looks like, more than 52 million Americans already own cryptocurrencies today. It’s estimated that over 27% of millennials own some form of crypto.  We are seeing more and more investors look to digital assets as a hedge against inflation. A survey from Fidelity Digital Assets found that seven in 10 institutional investors from around the world, including advisers, family offices, pensions, hedge funds and endowments, plan to buy or invest in digital assets within the next five years. Deloitte’s 2021 Global Blockchain Survey found 76% of respondents believe digital assets will either serve as a strong alternative to fiat currencies or outright replace fiat within the next five to 10 years.  Through the comment process, FASB received a significant response of 522 comment letters. Of these 522 responses, 445 (85% of the respondents) commented solely and exclusively on accounting standards for digital assets, providing feedback on the pervasive impact of digital assets and the need to prioritize standards setting. More than 50% of the respondents indicated that standard setting for digital assets should be considered as the highest priority for FASB.  The Board will consider the impact of this feedback in upcoming meetings in setting scope and priorities in standard setting.  “We sometimes accelerate projects, particularly when there’s significant investor interest in an emerging issue,” FASB Chair Richard Jones told the Wall Street Journal.  Accordingly, the Chamber of Digital Commerce will continue to work with FASB to assure this crucial standard setting is on the agenda and prioritized accordingly because 2022 is going to be a pivotal year. It is clear from the FASB survey that there is demand to address accounting standards for digital assets. At the same time, the U.S. and other countries seem poised to develop clear policy frameworks for crypto. It is important that all invested in the growth of the digital asset ecosystem continue to work to increase this momentum to bring certainty to the marketplace for innovators and investors alike.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT,Perianne Boring,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/02/07/accounting-standards-are-key-to-getting-digital-assets-on-corporate-balance-sheets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e8dbaf02fe2024aff78b248a1b923fef6fa05e88-2797x1858.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396083,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0ihZ,1644242458,Aleo Blockchain Raises $200M for Privacy-Minded DeFi,"Pledging to launch its private, programmable Aleo blockchain network “later this year,” crypto startup Aleo Systems raised $200 million in a recent funding round.  SoftBank and Kora Management co-led the company’s Series B fundraising round, with venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Tiger Global, Samsung Ventures and others joining in.        The round comes as Aleo shifts into layer 1 launch mode. Its privacy-focused technology differs substantially from decentralized finance’s most popular programmable blockchains, like Ethereum with its built-in openness. That makes Aleo’s success hardly a guarantee, even in a frothy market.  The timing is perhaps more interesting given recent privacy-related developments in the wilds of DeFi. The Avalanche-based DeFi platform Wonderland was crippled following revelations that a pseudonymous executive was previously involved in the infamous QuadrigaCX collapse.  Nonetheless, Aleo’s backers believe there’s demand for scalable privacy networks. In an interview with CoinDesk, Chief Operating Officer Alex Pruden, an a16z veteran, said regulators, consumers and businesses could all benefit from the system Aleo plans to deploy.  Privacy tech  Pruden said Aleo will promote privacy-focused DeFi programmability.  “The way to think about it is, Aleo is like if the Ethereum model and the Zcash model had a baby,” he said. (Ethereum is a dominant smart contracts blockchain and Zcash is a privacy-focused transaction platform.) An alternative analogy: “Zcash with smart contracts,"" he said.  Aleo’s privacy chops derive from the same privacy technology that underpins Zcash. Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are a method of authenticating the validity of a crypto transaction without broadcasting its details; this allows users to keep their money matters private.  “Zero-knowledge execution,” or Zexe (pronounced “sexy” with a Z), is Aleo’s smart contracts-friendly evolution of ZKPs. It will see users execute off-chain transactions that pair with on-chain cryptographic proofs. Crunching often complex transactions off-chain promises more “scalability, efficiency and privacy” than doing it all on-chain, according to Pruden.  Read more: A16z Leads $28M Funding Round for Data Privacy Platform Aleo  Ethereum’s on-chain computations slow down that network, he said. That on-chain, off-chain dichotomy is part of the reason why Aleo’s smart contracts won't be Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible.  A new smart contracts programming language called “Leo” takes the place of Solidity, Ethereum developers’ lingua coda.  A critical company  Aleo Systems is poised to wield an outsize role in its eponymous blockchain’s growth, according to Pruden’s account. Acting as a caretaker, core developer and hype man for the network, it plans to ultimately build a profitable business atop the open-source blockchain.  “What better team or company to build a business on top of an existing layer one than the team that built the layer one, right?” Pruden said. “It’s like a flywheel, a virtuous cycle.”  Pruden said the company hasn’t committed to decentralizing Aleo’s governance, but it hasn’t ruled it out, either.  Regardless, the $200 million will help Aleo Systems pump life into its pet project.  “That’s really what the Series B is all about: Raising additional capital for that purpose to build products and services on top of the Aleo Network,” Pruden said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | ZEC,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/02/07/aleo-blockchain-raises-200m-for-privacy-minded-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/45d77955fc42f721837e06e437c695e66d5e5d26-5485x4370.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In this sense, it will be similar to JPM Coin by U.S. banking giant JPMorgan, which is focused on speeding up wholesale payments such as bond transactions.  The stablecoin will be pegged to the Japanese yen.  Banks and other financial institutions will be allowed to issue stablecoins next year under new legislation designed to limit the issuance of such digital currencies by private companies.

Such kind of reporting on micro-transactions makes cryptocurrencies appear dull and stagnates the overall growth of the digital asset economy. In light of this, US lawmakers reintroduced the Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act on Monday that would exempt consumers from paying taxes on personal crypto transactions under $200. If it becomes law, the legislation would apply to all qualifying transactions from Dec. 31, 2021. An amendment to the Internal Revenue Service&apos;s tax code, the bipartisan bill was co-authored by Representatives David Schweikert and Suzan DelBene co-sponsored by Congressmen Tom Emmer and Darren Soto. &apos;Antiquated regulations around virtual currency do not take into account its potential for use in our daily lives, instead treating it more like a stock or ETF.

Ether, the second-largest digital currency, has scaled new heights, reaching $3K for the first time since January 21.

42396088,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0iiY,1644237370,"XRP Leads Gains in Major Cryptos, Bitcoin Holds Above $42K","The crypto market extended its recovery during morning hours in Europe following a weekend bounce, with major cryptocurrencies rising over the past 24 hours.  Bitcoin and ether, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, advanced 3%. Some analysts said Friday's release of stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs data buoyed investor sentiment, which supported an increase in the price of bitcoin.  “Despite U.S. jobs data on Friday being better than expected, global markets responded positively to the news, as investors admire the strength of the labor market,” Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at cryptocurrency brokerage GlobalBlock, said in an email to CoinDesk.  “This positive reaction ignited a bounce for the crypto markets too. Bitcoin broke out of two similar downtrends on the RSI within the past year, which both resulted in incredible rallies, hence potentially foreshadowing a Bitcoin rally to the upside,” Sotiriou said. The relative strength index (RSI) is an indicator that measures the magnitude of price changes over a certain time period. RSI readings above 70 are considered overbought, and those below 30 indicate an asset may be oversold.  The RSI level on bitcoin reached 61 during European trading hours on Monday after a jump from an ""oversold"" level of 20 in January, when the cryptocurrency traded at $35,550. Bitcoin was trading above $42,500 at the time of publication, with possible resistance at $46,000.  Some traders expect bitcoin to see more interest from investors even as the U.S. Federal Reserve tightens its monetary policy.  “It is worth noting that the Nonfarm Payrolls can force the Fed to move faster to tighten monetary policy,” Alex Kuptsikevich, a senior financial analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “If cryptocurrencies manage to resist and continue to grow, this will be a serious trend reversal order. Just like on Friday, when investors decided to buy BTC in order to protect investments from inflation.”  Elsewhere, gains in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization ranged from a low of 1.6% for Terra’s LUNA to as high as 9.9% for XRP.  Meme coins led market moves outside of the top 10. Shiba Inu’s SHIB tokens surged to $0.000029 during Asian trading hours from the $0.000022 level on Sunday evening, as reported.  XRP leads crypto gains  Ripple's XRP token led gains among major cryptocurrencies with a 16% increase to over $0.77. The price surged amid positive sentiment around the court case in which the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleges the blockchain-based payments firm sold XRP as an unregistered security to the public.  In the latest proceedings last week, New York Southern District Court Judge Analisa Torres ordered the unsealing of three documents in connection with the case.  Torres also granted the payment giant's request to file a response to the motion to strike fair notice defense. That defense focuses on whether Ripple had reasonable notice from the SEC about whether XRP sales were illegal, according to law firm Hogan & Hogan.  Some industry attorneys said the proceedings suggested the case could be headed for a verdict soon. XRP added $0.07 on Friday, holding the $0.66 level over the weekend before Monday’s surge to $0.78.

However, bitcoin is still king, Farrell wrote, adding that the crypto could reach $200,000 in the second half of the year, following a choppy start to 2022.  FSInsight also said that decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and other Web 3 applications have driven massive growth of the Ethereum network.  Ethereum is undervalued relative to cloud platforms, and ether, which is the native token of the network, could reach $12,000 in 2022, the report said.  There is optimism surrounding Ethereum's transition to proof-of-stake in 2022, which if it happens, would likely result in capital inflows irrespective of bitcoin performance, the note added.

It's a dangerous precedent, Armstrong wrote in a blog post Friday, when Coinbase (COIN) or any tech company begins to make ""judgment calls on difficult societal issues, acting as judge and jury.""  Armstrong's post was a timely one given what's happening in Canada, where the crowdfunding platform GoFundMe - at request of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government - has frozen distribution of more than C$9 million that had been raised in support of truckers protesting the country's vaccine mandate for truckers who cross into the U.S. It also comes amid mounting pressure on streaming platform Spotify to drop Joe Rogan's podcast for allegedly spreading coronavirus ""misinformation.""  In describing Coinbase's approach to removal or moderation, Armstrong differentiated between infrastructure products and public-facing products. Infrastructure products are used privately by individual customers and allow access to basic financial services.  For those, he wrote, Coinbase will follow ""rule of law,"" as elected governments, not companies, should decide what is and isn't allowed.  Public-facing products may include user-generated content, with social features visible to large numbers of users, and thus require a more nuanced approach, Armstrong wrote, in an apparent reference to Coinbase's forthcoming marketplace for non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  Coinbase will remove content only if 1) It's illegal in a jurisdiction in which Coinbase operates; 2) It's a free speech exception under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; or 3) A critical partner (such as a payment processor or bank) requires Coinbase to remove it.

The price of the AXS token has increased by 40% in just three days, providing the popular NFT game more support. It would be implementing a new rewards structure for its PVP competition round. Axie Infinity also announced a 56% reduction in the manufacturing of its native Smooth Love Potion (SLP) tokens. The NFT-based videogame, developed by Sky Mavis in Vietnam, employs the governance token &apos;AXS&apos; for its Axie Infinity protocol. AXS token allows players to buy in-game NFTs called &apos;Axies&apos; via the game&apos;s native store. Why did Axie Infinity reduce the supply of SLP tokens? Initially, there were three methods to gain SLP tokens in Axie Infinity: fulfilling daily goals in-game, clearing levels in a special &apos;adventure mode,&apos; and participating in area combats. The tokenomics behind obtaining SLP tokens was defective because SLP tokens became inflationary as a result of too many tokens being earned - outnumbering the demand. While burning tokens helped reduce the number of tokens, the burn rate was not keeping up with the earn rate, resulting in 4x SLP than what was burned. Burning occurs in the game via breeding Axies, which allows players to spend their existing AXS tokens to breed more. The game may now significantly improve the equilibrium between SLP supply and demand...",POSITIVE,AXS,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | ICO | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/axie-infinity-axs-token-rises-40-after-announcement-of-change-in-reward-structure/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

This week, Terra owners have been voting on a sports sponsorship deal, what appears to be a first-of-its-kind event. Do Kwon, the founder of Terraform Labs made a fresh proposal to the Terra community this week, allowing LUNA holders to vote on a new five-year, $38.5 million sponsorship with an unknown team in one of the United States &apos;big four&apos; sports leagues (MLB, NBA, NFL, NHL).

He will also be removed from his position as director of operations of the decentralized autonomous organization's (DAO) corresponding legal entity True Names Ltd.  In the tweet, Millegan wrote that “homosexual acts are evil. Transgenderism doesn’t exist. Abortion is murder. Contraception is perversion. So is masturbation and porn.”  ENS gives the ability to point a domain name to a wallet. Users would be able to go to a .eth domain name as opposed to a complex wallet address. Domains can be traded as non-fungible tokens (NFT). There are over 675,000 registered names, according to ENS.  “Practically, it means that you can have a name that you own, that has all the decentralization and censorship resistance and programmability of Ethereum,” Millegan told CoinDesk in 2020 in describing the project.  Millegan hasn't apologized for the tweet, citing his religious beliefs.  In a post on Discord, he reaffirmed his beliefs and said he’s open to working with and being friends with a wide range of people. He also said that traditionally minded Christians, Muslims and Jews should not be excluded from Web 3 – and he has received messages of support from those who self-identify as being traditional followers of these religious groups.  As of late Sunday Pacific time, community delegates from the ENS DAO voted to remove Millegan from his position with a majority voting in favor.

""Brantly has been a valued team member of TNL for the past three years. However, as a team we felt that his position with TNL is no longer tenable,"" Johnson said in a Twitter thread. ""Many of you were hurt by Brantly's comments over the past 24 hours, and we strongly believe that ENS should be an inclusive community.

However, its growth slowed down a lot since the crypto crash of November 2021. Moreover, the network&apos;s total capacity is still minuscule compared to Bitcoin&apos;s $790 billion market cap. In fact, users hold more Bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain as Wrapped tokens, with the total market cap of Wrapped BTC standing at $10 billion. In the meantime, CoinShares in its latest Digital Asset Outlook report pointed out that the Lightning Network is yet to become mainstream as it caters relatively to only a small part of the market, despite being around for four years. Perhaps, this might be due to the fact that the majority of users still perceive Bitcoin as a long-term investment and a hedge against inflation, instead of using it for payments.

42396072,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0iYi,1644222645,VR Headset Maker HTC Safe From Meta’s Stock Wipeout,"Taiwan-based virtual reality headset manufacturer HTC, considered to be a metaverse proxy stock because the company’s Vive headsets are an essential tool for VR-based vision, was seemingly spared by Meta’s recent stock decline. HTC Taipei-listed stock posted a 5% gain by mid-day Monday as the markets in Taipei re-opened after the Lunar New Year.  Last week Meta, formerly known as Facebook, posted a $10 billion loss on its augmented and virtual reality division. This wiped over $200 billion from the company’s market cap as the stock subsequently plummeted over 25%, the stock's largest single-day decline yet.  This decline had a cascading effect on metaverse-related tokens. According to a prior report from CoinDesk, axie infinity (AXS), sandbox (SAND) and gala (GALA) fell as much as 12% in the 24-hour period after Meta’s earnings.  Since then investor sentiment on these tokens has changed. AXS is up 13% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko, decentraland (MANA) is up 8%, and GALA is posting a 7.5% gain.  According to on-chain data, approximately $4.3 million in short positions on MANA have been liquidated during the last 24 hours. AXS had $2.6 million in short liquidations during the same time period, and $1.5 million in long liquidations.  Despite the newfound interest in its VR headsets, HTC isn’t profitable. The company has faced fierce competition from other Android handset makers, pushing its phones down to a sub-1% market share, too low to be counted by most market research firms.  HTC first saw its stock rally around the metaverse in mid-October, around the time Facebook announced its rebranding to Meta. From mid-October to year's end, HTC stock posted gains of approximately 140%.  The company has been called Taiwan’s version of GameStop. Its VR headsets have been around since 2015; sales are increasing but annual volume is still moderate.  However, on PTT, Taiwan’s version of Reddit, references to the company’s name and ticker have spiked as many believe that without the Vive VR headset, the metaverse’s true vision is impossible to achieve.",NEUTRAL,AXS | MANA,ASIA | AXS | BUSINESS | MANA | MARKET,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/07/vr-headset-maker-htc-safe-from-metas-stock-wipeout,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aa6685c9eb173bbe23e5edcea2330fabb3788f28-1200x623.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The move came amid a broader recovery in the crypto market as bitcoin and ether regained the $42,000 and $3,000 price levels respectively. Gains in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization ranged from a low of 1.6% for Terra’s LUNA to a high of 9.9% for XRP.  Meme coins led market moves outside of the top 10 cryptocurrencies. Shiba Inu’s SHIB tokens surged to $0.000029 during Asian trading hours from the $0.000022 level on Sunday evening, a surge of over 24%, while Dogecoin’s DOGE jumped to $0.169 from $0.145.  Price charts showed SHIB hit resistance at the $0.000029 level, causing a sell-off during the Asian morning hours that brought the price lower.  The price movement caused nearly $10 million in losses to liquidations for traders of SHIB-tracked futures products. In the past 24 hours, traders lost $4.31 million to Binance’s 1000SHIB futures product, which holds 1,000 SHIB per contract. Traders also lost $5.49 million in SHIB futures. Over 74% of SHIB futures were short, or betting against a price rally.  SHIB’s weekend surge came days after developers unveiled a tie-up with Welly’s, a fast-food chain selling burgers and fries.

Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Bitcoin moved little on light weekend volume, while prices of gaming tokens spiked.  Technician's take: Bitcoin attempts to break downtrend; faces resistance toward $45K.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $42,420 +2.04%  Ether (ETH): $3,036 +0.64%  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Cosmos ATOM +13.1% Smart Contract Platform Ethereum Classic ETC +5.1% Smart Contract Platform Cardano ADA +2.0% Smart Contract Platform  Top Losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Internet Computer ICP −5.3% Computing Solana SOL −1.3% Smart Contract Platform Ethereum ETH −0.9% Smart Contract Platform  Markets  S&P 500: 4,500 +0.5%  DJIA: 35,089 -.06%  Nasdaq: 14,089 +1.5%  Gold: $1,807 +0.1%  Market moves  Bitcoin (BTC) moved little on Sunday after another weekend with light volume, while tokens associated with gaming saw a price bump.  At the press time, the oldest cryptocurrency is changing hands at $42,420, up 2.04% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data. Ether, the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is up 0.64% to $3,036 in the same time period.  According to data compiled by CoinDesk, bitcoin’s trading volume across major centralized exchanges on the weekend was down significantly from Friday, but in line with most weekdays in the past week. Spot trading volume was reduced over the past week, as major crypto markets in Asia were off for the Lunar New Year holidays.  In the broader cryptocurrency market, gaming tokens rallied over the weekend, while the majority of the market remained quiet. At the time of writing, data from Messari shows the price of gala (GALA), axie infinity (AXS) and decentraland (MANA) were up by double-digit percentages in the past 24 hours.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Attempts to Break Downtrend; Faces Resistance Toward $45K  Bitcoin (BTC) buyers were active over the past 24 hours as the cryptocurrency topped $40,000 for the first time in two weeks. Upside momentum is improving after technical indicators reached the most oversold levels since March 2020.  Buyers will need to make a decisive move above $40,000 in order to reverse the price downtrend since the November peak around $69,000. Over the past few months, brief rallies have been capped below resistance levels, which means sellers have been in control.  Over the short term, however, bitcoin could see additional upside, especially because the relative strength index (RSI) is not overbought on the daily chart. The next level of resistance is around $45,000, which could stall the current rally.  Bitcoin's price will need to remain above $37,000 over the weekend in order to signal the start of a recovery phase. Still, significant price gains are unlikely if negative momentum signals are confirmed on the monthly chart.  Technical confirmation requires at least two consecutive daily or weekly price closes above or below a major support/resistance level. When gains or losses are carried over into the following trading session it may reflect conviction among buyers and sellers, leading to more reliable price targets.
