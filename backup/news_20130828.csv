Peter Vessenes, Patrick Murck and Marco Santori represented the Bitcoin Foundation and spent the day talking protocol, block chain and mining with representatives from the offices of several congressmen and senators.  Santori, who is chair of the foundation's Regulatory Affairs Committee, said the attendees raised a number of concerns including privacy and anti-money laundering issues, but most just wanted to know how the protocol works.  ""The protocol can be used in many ways, so it's helpful to make that distinction. We gave examples and analogies to explain the fundamentals. We said if bitcoin is like email, a bitcoin service is like Gmail and a bitcoin company is like Google,"" Santori explained.  There were also people at the meeting who had a very in-depth understanding of bitcoin. Santori said he was surprised to find there were a few attendees who knew more about bitcoin than he did.  Overall, he thinks the meeting went very well, but stressed it's still very early days:    ""We’re not yet at a stage where we are advocating a policy position. Capitol Hill is still understanding what bitcoin is, and we are trying to facilitate that process.      We were successful in bringing bitcoin out of boogeyman territory, though. That's the first step, which hopefully prevents authorities making knee-jerk reactions.""    He believes it was important for the representatives to meet people involved in the bitcoin world, to show that digital currency is used by normal people, not just hardened criminals.  ""Our real success over the past couple of days was beginning this dialogue. We welcome other federal regulatory agencies and enforcement agencies to reach out with any questions or concerns."" Santori concluded.  Yesterday's session followed a meeting on Monday hosted by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which was attended by the Bitcoin Foundation and high-level representatives from a number of US federal agencies.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/08/28/bitcoin-foundation-sets-the-record-straight-at-capitol-hill,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b46dad85bceee899f8adde6a1864d71ac623d7f2-1000x666.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425054,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHqIJh,1377702032,Feathercoin secures its block chain with advanced checkpointing,"Feathercoin has announced advanced checkpointing in its block chain to protect against 51% attacks. The advanced checkpointing (ACP) feature will remove the need for changes to client software by publishing a feed of checkpoints, via a central node.  Checkpointing is a lesser known part of cryptocurrencies. It's a way to maintain the integrity of the block chain by recording blocks out of it. In bitcoin, checkpoints are stored in the code of the client. This enables it to verify its checkpoints against the copy of the block chain it has downloaded, ensuring that block chain has not been retroactively rewritten in a 51% attack.  This means that as the block chain grows, client software has to be updated to store new checkpoints within its code. This leaves clients that have not been updated for a long time vulnerable to attacks on the block chain.  The Feathercoin team has sought to solve this problem by separating the checkpoint record from the client software. The team have created a ""master node"" and updated its client software to version 0.6.4.3, which will publish the series of checkpoints for Feathercoin clients to check against.  While it would be difficult for a 51% attack to be carried out against a network as large as bitcoin's, Feathercoin has already suffered a 51% attack. The basic checkpoint system that was in place at the time fortunately helped prevent long term damage to the currency.  ""I am trying to make a safe environment for miners and merchants. We had some large scale attacks when our hash power was much less than we see now. During that time, miners had a large number of blocks orphaned. Some lost days worth of mining,"" said Feathercoin founder, Peter Bushnell. ""This is unacceptable and considering the scale of these attacks I think it is absolutely important to make sure that the attackers are not able to take control of the network like this again.""  He wants ACP to be distributed as this would provide an effective solution that is closer to Satoshi's original idea that bitcoin has to remain decentralised. ""However, there are trade offs even in bitcoin – there are checkpoints in the bitcoin client which are defined by the developers. No one else can put checkpoints in bitcoin other than the devs.""  He went on to say:    ""For it to be decentralised they would need to hold their own copy of the block chain and would checkpoint independently. The block that gets checkpointed would be the one that the majority of the nodes agree upon. So a node in the UK and Australia might have checkpointed different blocks, it is up to the rest of the world to choose between them by which blocks turn up in the nodes block chain.      ""What we would have to do is find trusted nodes. It would make sense that this belongs to the miners. So all the major pools should be nodes as this is where the miners are. Currently the difficulty is too high to solo mine, the only person solo mining are the attackers. These are future plans but right now there is only one node checkpointing and I am the only person with access to the node.""    In answer to concerns that Bushnell himself could exploit the system, he pointed out that no one can roll back the chain with ACP.  He said he was once asked what he would do if someone said they would chop his fingers off if he didn't roll back or join a chain of their choosing. ""That would be a very unfortunate misunderstanding and I would lose all my fingers!"" He said.",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/08/28/feathercoin-secures-its-block-chain-with-advanced-checkpointing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/587e9d7b8464b38c3da5114e6d5359b6b57cb776-650x350.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425062,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHqITh,1377690028,Bitcoin enters Oxford Dictionaries Online,"Bitcoin has made it onto Oxford Dictionaries Online (ODO) in the respected resource's latest quarterly update.  The term has been added to ODO alongside around 120 other words, including 'flatform' (a flat shoe with a high, thick sole), 'phablet' (a smartphone having a screen which is intermediate in size between that of a typical smartphone and a tablet computer) and Miley Cyrus' favourite - 'twerk' (dance to popular music in a sexually provocative manner involving thrusting hip movements and a low, squatting stance).  Angus Stevenson, head of dictionary projects at Oxford Dictionaries, explained that the criterion a word or phrase has to meet in order to make it onto ODO is pretty strict. His team collects, searches and analyses objective evidence of language use in a database called the Oxford English Corpus. ""This consists of billions of words from websites, newspapers, magazines and other publications,"" he said.  ""We found that bitcoin was a pretty common word, there's a lot of evidence for it on the internet,"" Stevenson explained.  ""We feel it has earned its place – it's frequently discussed in the mainstream media as well as particular parts of the internet and we traced it back to 2008 – that's the earliest date we found of its use, so far, so that's a fair while.""  ""bitcoin, n.: a digital currency in which transactions can be performed without the need for a central bank.""  Stevenson went on to say he thinks the word bitcoin has the potential to become an even more widely used word in the future, but stressed that its inclusion in ODO, which works alongside the Oxford English Dictionary, doesn't necessarily legitimise digital currency.  He explained: ""Inclusion in the ODO provides a recognition that a term has entered public consciousness and wide public use, it doesn’t make any judgement on whether it is good, bad, worthwhile or anything else.  ""It's just that we feel that, as a word, it is in genuine wide use and we feel it will stick around as part of the language. It may become a byword for a failed scheme, but we don't know in real terms what will become of it.""  Vladimir Marchenko, CTO at BTC Global, said he wasn't surprised to see bitcoin make it into ODO, but was interested in the chosen definition: ""The definition states that bitcoin eliminates the need to trust central banks. Bitcoin, in fact eliminates need for trust in any third party. But, of course, the central bank example is the most striking.""  He went on to say he would like 'satoshi' to be recognised in the dictionary as the smallest denomination of bitcoin.  ""It's inevitable, given that there are only 300,000 satoshis or 0.003 BTC per person in the world, on average,"" he concluded.  Here's a selection of the terms that have been added to ODO:    • apols, pl. n. (informal): apologies.      • babymoon, n. (informal): a relaxing or romantic holiday taken by parents-to-be before their baby is born; a period of time following the birth of a baby during which the new parents can focus on establishing a bond with their child.    • BYOD, n.: abbreviation of ‘bring your own device’: the practice of allowing the employees of an organization to use their own computers, smartphones, or other devices for work purposes.    • click and collect, n.: a shopping facility whereby a customer can buy or order goods from a store’s website and collect them from a local branch.    • digital detox, n.: a period of time during which a person refrains from using electronic devices such as smartphones or computers, regarded as an opportunity to reduce stress or focus on social interaction in the physical world.    • emoji, n: a small digital image or icon used to express an idea or emotion in electronic communication.    • FOMO, n.: fear of missing out: anxiety that an exciting or interesting event may currently be happening elsewhere, often aroused by posts seen on a social media website.    • food baby, n.: a protruding stomach caused by eating a large quantity of food and supposedly resembling that of a woman in the early stages of pregnancy.    • geek chic, n.: the dress, appearance, and culture associated with computing and technology enthusiasts, regarded as stylish or fashionable.    • hackerspace, n.: a place in which people with an interest in computing or technology can gather to work on projects while sharing ideas, equipment, and knowledge.    • selfie, n. (informal): a photograph that one has taken of oneself, typically one taken with a smartphone or webcam and uploaded to a social media website.    • TL;DR, abbrev.: ‘too long didn’t read’: used as a dismissive response to a lengthy online post, or to introduce a summary of a lengthy post.    • vom, v. & n. (informal): (be) sick; vomit.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/08/28/bitcoin-enters-oxford-dictionaries-online,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/286fd857a02551469f3c5a6ece586a86aacc4a96-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
