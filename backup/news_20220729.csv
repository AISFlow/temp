42393803,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpBLe1,1659130071,"Two Soccer Teams Transfer a South American Player Using USDC, But There’s Collateral Damage","This week, São Paulo, one of Brazil's most important soccer teams, announced the acquisition of Giuliano Galoppo, a player from Argentinian mid-table club Banfield.  Nothing unusual there. Players transfer all the time. What made it a special occasion was that money was transferred in the form of USD Coin (USDC), a stablecoin, via the Latin American exchange Bitso.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Sports Week.  Thales Araújo de Freitas, CEO of Bitso in Brazil, called the transaction a “historic moment for Bitso, São Paulo and South American soccer more broadly.”  It is no coincidence that São Paulo experimented with crypto for a transaction. In January, Bitso, the first crypto unicorn in Latin America, became a sponsor of the club, one of the biggest in Brazil and owner of the legendary Morumbi stadium.  The announcement generated particular interest in Argentina, where it was interpreted as an attempt by Banfield to evade the current country's foreign exchange restrictions, which oblige exporters to convert their U.S. dollars into Argentine pesos within five days of the transaction.  The use of USDC to avoid the Central Bank of Argentina (BCRA) would make some sense for Banfield, as the bank’s regulations do not mention the word ""crypto."" After all, if the club was forced by the BCRA to liquidate its exports in the official exchange market, it would receive 131 Argentine pesos (ARS) per U.S. dollar, while the U.S. dollar in the financial and informal markets exceeds 300 ARS.  Read More: ‘My Bet Is on Bitcoin,’ Pro Soccer Player Says  Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at Circle, one of the companies behind USDC, tweeted that USDC was used “as the payment medium to avoid currency risk.”  The use of USDC by São Paulo – or Bitso, rather – is no coincidence. In November, the exchange partnered with Circle to launch an international transfer product, and so far the relationship has been fruitful. Bitso processed $1 billion in crypto remittances between Mexico and the U.S. in the first half of 2022 – up 400% from the same period last year – and plans to process $1 billion more by the end of December.  The operation between São Paulo and Banfield may have cost less than a SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications) one. But it appears that the Argentinian club will not be able to avoid currency risk, as Disparte said, because the club will be required to convert the full amount of the transaction into Argentine pesos at the official exchange rate, BCRA sources told CoinDesk.  Read More: Why Sports and Crypto Getting Together Is a Win-Win  Neither club disclosed the deal amount, but it was estimated at $8 million by the Argentine newspaper La Nación. That’s a significant amount for a club of Banfield’s size.  The use of crypto also creates other difficulties for Banfield. For having traded USDC, the club will be banned for 90 days from accessing the official exchange market to buy players – an import, after all – at the official rate, following a BCRA resolution published last week.  Banfield, if the BCRA’s word is kept, will receive ARS 1 billion after the transaction. However, if it wanted to buy the same player for the same amount, it would have to get ARS 2.4 billion in local financial markets – where the U.S. dollar quotation is 130% higher – as the BCRA's reserves are depleted and estimated to be negative by more than $4 billion.  The use of USDC accelerated the transfer and was good marketing, but it did not solve the underlying issue in Banfield's case. In fact, it made it worse.",NEUTRAL,USDC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | USDC,Andrés Engler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/29/two-soccer-teams-transfer-a-south-american-player-using-usdc-but-theres-collateral-damage,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0b26baddc18770ef320277ed14c96d5339820310-4377x3283.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A Look At BTC’s Weekly Chart Shows a Pointed Reversal at $20K  By Glenn Williams Jr.  While daily charts tend to be the default standard for investors, longer time frames may offer better insight. For example, the most recent weekly BTC chart has indicated that investors are seeing a solid entry point at $20,000.  The price of bitcoin fell for nine consecutive weeks starting on the week that ended on April 2, and dropped 10 out of 12 weeks overall (ended on June 17). The range of the downward move in the 12th week coincides with a decline in the relative strength index (RSI) to 19.43.  The RSI is a technical tool that measures the speed and pace of change of price movements. Often used as a proxy for momentum, RSI levels that exceed 70 indicate that an asset is in an overbought range. Conversely, RSI levels below 30 often signal that an asset’s price is oversold.  The weekly RSI for BTC now sits at 35, which implies that prices are neither overbought nor oversold, but rather are in a neutral range.  BTC’s Seven-Day Performance Shows Second Consecutive Week of Gains  Following last week’s 10% gain, BTC finished the current week up 5%. Ether’s performance was similar, with the price up 9% following a 19% gain in the week before. ETH’s price has increased for four weeks in a row, and bitcoin’s price has risen for two weeks in a row.  Ethereum’s 10th ""shadow fork"" went into effect Tuesday, 26 hours earlier than expected, as the network continues to run tests ahead of the anticipated shift from using the energy-intensive proof-of-work protocol to proof-of-stake. As it approaches its software update known as “the Merge” in September, Ethereum has been undergoing a series of tests, or shadow forks, that copy data from the main network to a test network.  The shift to proof-of-stake is expected to have a deflationary impact on ETH prices and decrease overall supply. A decrease in the supply of an asset generally boosts its price.  For BTC, there’s fear in the air … but not as much  In acknowledging the role that emotions play in crypto investing, the Fear and Greed Index gauges sentiment relative to the price of bitcoin. The index ranges from 0 to 100, with 0 meaning “extreme fear” and100 “extreme greed.""  The index accounts for data including price, momentum, volatility, social media sentiment and Google Search trends. While applicable to bitcoin alone, it is also a proxy for overall crypto market sentiment.  On Friday, the Fear and Greed Index was 39, which falls within the “fear” category, but is much higher than the 6 – an extreme fear level – of June 18. In the last 12 months, the index’s highest reading of 84 – extreme greed – came last October when BTC exceeded $60,000.

42411756,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfgp6,1659125460,Getting Started With Crypto Twitter,"The crypto community on Twitter is a constantly evolving repository of questions, answers, explanations and speculations from every corner of the crypto community. It is one of the key platforms where ideas get exchanged: people and projects announce milestones in their progress, issue reassurances when things go wrong and share their personal thoughts.  If you’re new to it, here are some ideas about where to start.  Crypto personalities and people to follow  Your first step to joining Crypto Twitter (#cryptotwitter) is to start following some key accounts on Twitter, but with the noise and volume of a subject like crypto, it can be hard to know where to begin.  To collect a healthy stock of voices on your feed, a useful approach may be to break down the crypto crowd into categories such as developers, writers, investors and so on. Perhaps you want to focus on one category. Or you might want to pick a few big names from each to get started.  Crypto founders and visionaries  To begin with, there are the movers and shakers of the crypto world, the people who have personally developed or managed major crypto entities. The team who founded Ethereum are some of the leaders in this field. Their accounts will keep you up to date with the layer 1 blockchain, as well as developments in the wide range of projects they now work on.  Vitalik Buterin is perhaps the best-known of Ethereum’s founders. He wrote the white paper when he was just 19 years old. These days, he tweets a mixture of running commentary on the latest crypto debates and thought-provoking philosophical comments. A good deal of his posts are not about crypto at all, but wider political or moral questions. He asks his followers challenging questions as often as he states his own views.  Fellow Ethereum founder Gavin Wood has since co-founded Polkadot, one of Ethereum’s largest competitors. His posts are usually concise, crypto-focused and technical. He retweets a lot of crypto commentary from other voices too. And Joseph Lubin founded ConsenSys, the Ethereum-application incubator, after playing his part in founding Ethereum itself.  Bitcoin’s founder is a little trickier to follow on Twitter: nobody knows who they are. But if you’re especially interested in Bitcoin, there are a number of accounts dedicated entirely to sharing news about the original cryptocurrency. Two useful ones to start with are @DocumentingBTC and @BTC_Archive.  The founders of the major crypto exchanges are worth following too. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, better known as CZ, tweets views and updates about his own company and the wider space almost every day. Coinbase founder Brian Armstrong is also very active on Twitter, sharing frequent news and insights about crypto regulation, among other areas.  Crypto writers and content creators  After you’ve hit ""follow"" on a few of crypto’s early visionaries, you might look at the people who have made names and even careers writing about the subject. As well as popular authors, some specialist academics and researchers are active on Twitter too. In this category, you will probably want to zero in on the level of technical detail that suits your own background.  Andreas Antonopoulos is a famous name in this area. He is a consultant, podcaster and author who has also created a deep catalog of YouTube content to help people understand crypto. His tweets often offer pithy explanations of crypto concepts or take a stance on a hot topic. If your goal is to educate yourself about crypto, but you don’t have much in the way of a technical background, you might appreciate his work. Podcaster and author Laura Shin also posts a lot of video content, interviews, news from third parties and other content designed to keep you up to date with the conversation.  If you want to balance your feed, you may be interested in adding some Web3 skeptics to your list such as Wikipedia editor Molly White’s Web3 is going just great account or Jackson Palmer, the founder of dogecoin who has since become an ardent crypto critic.  Crypto investors and funds  A third important category of crypto character is investors. Some of these people are responsible for moving so much money around that it is probably worth listening to their thoughts, even when you don’t agree with them. Prominent examples would be Ari David Paul, founder of BlockTower Capital, or Cathie Wood, CEO and founder of Ark Invest.  If you particularly want to follow famous investors, simply look up the biggest crypto investment funds and then search for their managers’ names on Twitter. They may not be sharing their strategies, but you might learn something all the same.  Twitter threads, retweets and lists  Once you’ve found someone you like or find interesting, you can quickly find more by looking at whom they are retweeting as well as the people they are interacting with. Check out the ""Tweets & Replies"" tab on any profile to see not only the threads they start, but also the people they are replying to. You can trace a path this way through an online community. If in doubt, follow: You can always unfollow later.  Another good hack that Twitter has hidden a bit is to find someone you like and see if they've curated any of their own Twitter lists. For example, Taylor Monahan, who has a great pinned thread of resources for beginners on her profile, also has curated lists that she has created or found and followed herself:  To see if someone has any lists, just add /lists to the end of their profile URL, for example: https://twitter.com/tayvano_/lists will get you to the lists above. You can follow lists other people create wholesale or use them to just add individuals from any list who pique your crypto curiosity.  The quirks of crypto Twitter profiles: NFTs and .eth names  Even if you’re already an avid Twitter user, you still might be confused by some of the things crypto people put on their profiles.  Some members of the crypto community like to display their crypto assets visually to their digital audience. This is how ""profile picture (PFP) NFTs"" came about. Some NFT holders like to make the relevant artwork their profile picture, proclaiming themselves proud owners and often signaling their passion about crypto in general.  Twitter itself has acknowledged and actually encouraged the practice, by offering to verify whether users owned the NFTs associated with their profile pictures. As of January 2022, you could set your Twitter profile picture to your NFT and get a special hexagonal border to show its authenticity. Someone else could copy and paste the image if they wanted, but they would not get the border.  Crypto people sometimes put their .eth name on their profile too. This is basically a way of collecting all of that person’s crypto wallets and websites under one link, instead of giving a list of URLs and wallet addresses. The bulk of a crypto enthusiast’s digital life can be gathered, as it were, in one place. For example, Vitalik Buterin has made his Twitter username vitalik.eth.  The provider of the system is actually a decentralized application (dapp) called Ethereum Naming Service (ENS) and the names are themselves tradable NFTs.  As with all social media, the trick to getting the most out of crypto Twitter is to find the part that adds the most to your life, avoid the parts that don’t and try not to spend all day on it.

42421146,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZWRR,1659123090,"Crypto’s Slide Hasn't Bled Into the 'Real Economy,' IMF Official Says","The sell-off in the crypto market hasn’t really spilled over into the broader financial system, according to Antonio Garcia Pascual, deputy chief of the global market analysis division at the International Monetary Fund.  The crypto industry’s total market cap fell to a recent low of $873 billion from its peak of $3 trillion last November. The downturn put pressure on many crypto platforms, but largely “remained within the ecosystem” without spilling over into the “real economy,” Pascual said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” show on Friday.  “What you saw is quite a bit of a shake-up in the riskier [assets],” including certain stablecoins and tokens within decentralized finance (DeFi), Pascual said.  Still, Pascual noted that those in the U.S. and elsewhere who invested substantial amounts of money into crypto lost big on the implosion of the TerraUSD stablecoin in May.  The interview followed the release of the IMF’s “World Economic Outlook Update: Gloomy and More Uncertain” July report, which detailed how the sell-off in crypto assets “led to large losses in crypto investment vehicles” and “the failure of algorithmic stablecoins.”  Moreover, issues with liquidity hit funds and lenders that bought into Terra’s network. Crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, for example, lost over $200 million with its investment in TerraUSD. Similarly, crypto broker Celsius Network, which has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, blamed its liquidity issues to the “domino effect” stemming from Terra’s collapse.  Pascual’s view reflects comments made by Citigroup analysts in May. The bank’s analysts said the collapse of Terra would be unlikely to affect the wider financial system because the crypto industry is relatively small.  Read more: Citi Says Fallout From Terra Collapse Unlikely to Hit Wider Financial System  Still, Pascual said crypto is growing, and he thinks algorithmic stablecoins will be adopted, although he said regulators need to set a clear policy on them first.  Crypto is expanding especially fast in emerging markets that are bearing the brunt of a worsening global economy, Pascual said, especially in countries with high debt, rising inflation and volatile currencies.  Although crypto itself is volatile, public blockchains allow people to move their money into an always-on, global financial system and escape domestic turmoil, he said. Additionally, the need for cheaper cross-border payments is likely driving use.  While the world escaped crypto contagion this time around, the increasing adoption and influence of crypto could cause “global risk spillovers” the next time, Pascaul cautioned.  This risk may only be years from now, when crypto is more widely used as an alternative to domestic currencies. El Salvador and the Central African Republic have already adopted bitcoin as legal tender, for example.  Pascual said that while the adoption of a cryptocurrency as legal tender may boost financial inclusion and represent an advancement in technology, it becomes a problem when a country adopts a digital currency in the midst of “issues related to macro and financial stability.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/07/29/cryptos-slide-hasnt-bled-into-the-real-economy-imf-official-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a2fe83f8b4ad245d28a0d69f5026474a64394f11-2267x1700.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Exchange Whale Ratio (EMA 7) Is Currently Below 0.50 As per a post from CryptoQuant, the BTC exchange whale ratio has gone down recently while the price has surged up. The &apos;exchange whale ratio&apos; is an indicator that measures the ratio between the sum of the top 10 Bitcoin transactions to exchanges and the total exchange inflows. exchange whale ratio = sum of top 10 inflow txs (in BTC) ÷ total exchange inflows (in BTC) Here, the ten largest transfers are considered as they generally belong to the whales. Thus, when the value of the ratio is high, it means whales are making up for a large part of the total inflows right now. Since investors usually send their BTC to exchanges for selling purposes, this trend can be a sign that whales are dumping at the moment. and hence can be bearish for the crypto&apos;s price. On the other hand, low values of the metric can suggest whales are currently occupying a normal amount of the total inflows. Such a trend could be either neutral or bullish for the coin&apos;s value. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 7-day exponential moving-average Bitcoin exchange whale ratio over the past month: The EMA-7 value of the metric looks to have been down in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the Bitcoin exchange whal...",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-breaks-24k-exchange-whale-ratio-declines/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/693032.jpeg

42411438,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNlK2,1659119400,"Where Traditional Public Financing Fails, Blockchain Steps in","This week saw big moves from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. First, the regulator declared several digital assets “securities” in the course of lobbing insider-trading allegations at an employee of crypto exchange Coinbase. The SEC then opened an investigation into Coinbase’s own alleged unauthorized sale of securities.  That’s huge grist for those trying to read the tea leaves of U.S. crypto regulation, but I want to take a big step back and think about the underlying issue of how societies fund large collective projects. Securities are a well understood way of doing that, and the SEC regulates that system in large part to keep money flowing to genuine, socially useful investments.  But one of the major promises of cryptocurrency networks is an entirely new approach to pooling and deploying capital, one that complicates the traditional split between public and private funding. It’s a major reason crypto has captured the global imagination and a key topic for those who would like to see regulators strike a balance between protecting the public and fostering innovation.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Bitcoin as nongovernmental public infrastructure  I’ve recently had an important reminder of why Bitcoin and other truly decentralized money systems have value in the real world. It came via “The Unbanking of America,” a 2017 book by Lisa Servon that tells an incredible story of the failures of private banking to serve even the most basic financial needs of Americans, and by extension, the world.  Those failures center on banks’ increasing consolidation, rising use of punitive fees and declining levels of service for average retail depositors. To pick just one particularly egregious example, Servon describes some banks’ use of “debit resequencing” software to actively increase the number of overdraft fees customers pay by processing withdrawals out of chronological order. Servon further describes how slow bank clearing times for checks have pushed even successful small businesses toward alternate services like check cashing storefronts.  The good news is that the percentage of Americans who are “unbanked” has decreased significantly over the past decade, and is now at 5.4% according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the lowest level since data collection began in 2009. But that may be more a result of economic growth than better bank services. As Servon details, a lot of people choose to not use banks because their policies are particularly punitive to low-income customers. So if the looming recession comes to pass, we may see traditional banking decline again.  Read more: How DAOs Open Doors for the Unbanked  The rise of anti-customer practices in conventional banking is substantially driven by its for-profit bias in the U.S. Activists have for years been campaigning for major reforms, such as an equivalent to the public or semipublic postal banking systems in Japan and Germany. Perhaps understandably, U.S. hostility to growing the public sector is a roadblock for that campaign.  Which brings us to Bitcoin. Bitcoin offers the core services of a bank, particularly saving and money transmission. It has plenty of downsides, such as its volatility and the various costs imposed by proof-of-work mining. But it offers, in whatever tentative and imperfect form, a true “third way” – neither government-run postal banking on the one hand nor rapaciously profit-hungry private services on the other.  Decentralizing public infrastructure funding  That third way would never have been possible without the approach to viral expansion baked into Bitcoin’s underlying security model and software implementation. Bitcoin incentivized early adopters and investment in at least two ways: Early miners got proportionately greater rewards thanks to the token-emission curve, and early holders of BTC tokens have benefitted from asset appreciation driven by growing adoption.  This is often thought of as a mere parallel to the Silicon Valley venture capital model that made early investors in Facebook and Amazon rich. But in reality, it’s something far more novel. Early Bitcoin supporters fed resources into a “bitcoin ecosystem” that ultimately funded everything from software development to hardware infrastructure and basic computer science research.  But the resulting network and ecosystem are not owned by a private corporation or by a centralized government. And while it’s not free to use, it is accessible to anyone with a smartphone and internet access, making it a more genuine “public good” than a lot of directly government-funded infrastructure or services. (U.S. National Parks, for instance, are very much not free.) Perhaps the most notable champion of the idea that blockchains can fund public goods is Kevin Owocki of Gitcoin, whose ideas I’m drawing on substantially here.  Bitcoin as a public good is also a striking contrast with the services offered by companies like Twitter or Google, which strategically describe themselves as “platforms” to help convey a sense of openness and neutrality. In reality, as we’ve discovered over the past decade, even the best-intended Web 2.0 “platform” is really a centralized corporate entity subject to political pressure – and that goes double for financial middlemen.  Read more: Crypto Fund Variant Commits $450M to Backing Web3, DeFi Projects  In a perfect world, keeping public financial infrastructure out of the hands of the government wouldn’t be particularly desirable. In principle (if you can hold your laughter for a moment), the government is an extension of citizens’ collective power and serves the interest of those citizens. But that is no longer how many Americans regard their own government, and for good reason.  In fact, an excellent case study in the ways the government has failed to serve the public interest is the internet itself, a story retold in Ben Tarnoff’s new book, “Internet for the People.” For three decades from the 1960s to the 1990s, research and development of the internet was almost entirely funded by taxpayer money, particularly through military and academic research channels.  But as the former ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Network) became more commercially appealing in the early 1990s, the benefits of all that public investment were essentially handed out to telecom companies in exchange for campaign contributions to privatization-happy politicians. Tarnoff highlights that another future was possible:  During the privatization debate, Democrat Daniel Inouye, then a U.S. senator from Hawaii, proposed reserving 20% of internet backbone bandwidth as a strictly public facility. The provision never got traction in the context of the long Reagan Revolution and rising anti-government sentiment.  But in a bit of fractal irony, this kind of handover itself feeds into rising skepticism of conventional government structures for funding public goods. At least right now (arguably because of legalized graft through lobbying and campaign finance), the U.S. government has been significantly subverted toward channeling public money and its products into private pockets.  In the case of the internet, that ongoing process has included the removal of “common carrier” obligations from high-speed internet providers by the Bush and Trump administrations. Broadly, these obligations are meant to ensure certain public benefits in exchange for the handover of natural monopolies or publicly subsidized infrastructure to private for-profit operators. Over the course of the 20th century, common-carrier provisions ensured that, for instance, telephone service reached rural Americans.  Their elimination when it comes to broadband internet amounted to a massive corporate giveaway. It has led more or less directly to Americans paying more than citizens of nearly any other developed country for high-speed internet access, while getting worse service. Most damningly, it has led to the underprovision of high-speed internet to low-income and rural Americans – in much the same way that private banking has failed to serve low-income customers.  The bottom-up alternative  I won’t make the simplistic argument that decentralized funding along the lines of Bitcoin offers a “better” way to build public financial or technical infrastructure. It’s certainly not efficient enough to compete with the resource aggregation powers of a properly functioning government – in part because of its vulnerability to scams and fraud (more on that in a moment).  But Bitcoin’s model of bottom-up growth does seem rational in a context where a properly functioning government is nowhere to be found. In today’s America, and in many other nations, it seems any system created by public funds would be perpetually at risk of simply being handed over to the most persistent and deep-pocketed oligarchs, or having its rules subverted by rent seekers with unique access to legislators. This is more or less what happened with banks and financiers during the 2008 financial crisis – they lobbied to have the rules changed for their own benefit, and they won.  Bitcoin and similar systems may, in other words, offer a path to build public goods that aren’t vulnerable to government or regulatory “capture.”  Read more: Why DeFi Might Be Safer Than Traditional Finance  But the technological underpinnings of these systems also come with serious limitations. These structures can’t properly incentivize certain kinds of needed activities, and they introduce new kinds of risks. In particular, the premise of decentralized funding of public goods has proven to be extremely useful for scammers. Promising a replay of Bitcoin-like growth is extremely effective bait for projects that, too often, wind up building nothing at all.  But how to identify those cons early enough to protect less-savvy backers, while also enabling the good parts of decentralized funding, is a Gordian knot that we’ll have to untie another day.  Decentralized research and its limitations  Another apparent limit to decentralized funding of public goods, at least so far, is the case of basic research. This is clear in the development of the computer science behind blockchains, which itself emerged substantially from traditional publicly funded universities. As just one example, David Chaum, the godfather of digital cash, was largely trained and supported through the heavily publicly subsidized University of California system.  But as the crypto story progressed, it became more complicated. A lot of the most important application-focused research on digital cash starting in the 1990s was channeled through less formal networks that brought together academics, entrepreneurs and assorted rogues.  Above all, the cypherpunk mailing list was a crucial node of the community starting in the mid-1990s. Featuring a sui generis mix of technical brilliance and bizarro radicalism, it played a seemingly major role in pushing Satoshi along the path to creating Bitcoin – and it seems unlikely that anything similar could have existed in a purely corporate OR purely governmental context.  Since the debut of Bitcoin, crypto systems have further complicated the relationship between public and private projects. Particularly since around 2018, venture capitalists have begun devoting money to companies that build on Bitcoin or Ethereum. But because of the nature of blockchain networks, the benefits of such investments haven’t accrued entirely to the companies being funded. Crypto as a whole has begun to generate significant “public funding,” of a sort, for an entire ecosystem of developers, researchers, even philosophers and journalists (ahem).  This is more tilted toward real-world applications than basic research, but there is still a lot of crypto-derived funding for work that’s a long way from being business ready. One example is zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), which could profoundly revolutionize online privacy and data, but only once a lot of new tools are built to take advantage of it.  Crypto is where a lot of ideating on ZKPs is taking place, particularly at the level of application development. And rather than accumulating under one or a few corporate banners, that open-source knowledge will feed into a broader ecosystem, benefiting everyone.  Though again, let’s not give crypto itself too much credit: The work behind zero-knowledge proofs stretches back to 1985 work by academics, and was supported in part by government funds.  Redefining public investment  All of this contemplation about funding innovation and public infrastructure doesn’t easily yield up bullet-pointed takeaways. My main injunction here is to recognize that “the way we’ve always done things” doesn’t have to be the way things continue to be done, particularly when it comes to collective coordination around projects with potentially big collective benefits. Modern financial capital and modern government-funded investment both have their own biases and vulnerabilities, and it’s not crazy to consider that an entirely different structure could have entirely new strengths.  Specifically, the aggregation of economic power has fundamentally relied on intermediaries for the bulk of the modern era. Even nominally “public” projects funded through governments are at continual risk of takeover and subversion by those intermediaries. However imperfect and tentative in its current form, blockchain networks and cryptocurrencies’ biggest implication may be cutting out the middleman, not just from banking, but from a lot of other roles, too.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | RESEARCH,David Z.

42411431,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNkta,1659118868,Why We Need NFT Ticketing for Sports Events,"Whether it be scalping, fraudulent tickets or illicit reselling, the legacy ticketing system has its fair share of issues. This is hardly surprising from an industry that has scarcely innovated beyond digital barcodes over the past decade.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's ""Sports Week.""  Offering the potential for change through verifiable and authenticable tickets, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can remap the current landscape for sports events, providing secure and efficient entry to events and adding value for loyal fans.  The state of the ticketing industry  In May, chaos ensued at the UEFA Champions League Final in Paris, with claims of fraudulent tickets causing massive delays and bottlenecks at security checkpoints – resulting in clashes between fans and authorities. The event has since put a spotlight on conventional ticketing issues, with many pushing for digitization, with blockchain-powered NFT ticketing touted as the solution.  Using this system, tickets can be purchased online but only issued via SMS after the purchaser has proven their identity and been given access to a “holding” area when arriving at the venue. The NFT tickets contain an unfalsifiable and unique QR code that can be used to gain access to the event – keeping out unauthorized individuals and streamlining the experience for legitimate customers.  With pilots having already rolled out across the music industry via companies such as YellowHeart, NFT ticketing is now starting to garner the attention of the sporting world. For example, Michel Cadot, the French government’s Olympics envoy, has submitted a 30-page report to the prime minister’s office recommending the implementation of blockchain-powered ticketing for the 2024 Paris Olympic Games. Other events, such as the 2023 Rugby World Cup, are similarly evaluating the benefits of this new system.  Why NFTs?  This technology is an obvious fit because it offers complete veracity of the tickets' authenticity. NFTs can’t be forged, thanks to the immutable nature of the blockchains they are built on top of. A quick check of a cryptographic hash can separate the real thing from a fake in seconds, and the complete history of the ticket is recorded from the moment it is minted all the way through sale and redemption.  Read More: Sports NFTs: How to Get in the Game  This makes it significantly less likely that a scammer could gain access to falsified documents, and consumers can even have an easy way to check if the tickets they are buying are considered legitimate before handing over any money. This stands to be a significant boon for both consumer protection and industry revenue. Less fraud means more money in the pockets of artists, promoters, organizers and so on.  A shift into NFT ticketing would be a considerable blow to scammers and a major win for the industry. But this is hardly the only benefit of this innovation. The truth is that NFT technology is positioned to bring a variety of new opportunities to the ticketing and entertainment industries.  Bringing more to fans  With this technology, the door would be open for venues and leagues to work together to begin offering things like “dynamic tickets.” These could be digital passes that update as they are redeemed and offer additional bonuses such as airdrops of additional NFTs, access to exclusive merchandise, or free vouchers for food and beverages. Tickets could stay with individuals across multiple events, and continued engagement could bring in even larger rewards, including upgraded seats or personal meet and greets. There’s almost no end to what NFT tickets can do, and all of this is protected by the unfalsifiable nature of blockchain.  For example, the NBA is looking into issuing NFT “ticket stubs” to fans when they redeem their tickets at a venue. Why? Because ticket stubs from memorable games turn into big money down the line, and currently, the NBA sees none of that. However, NFTs can be programmed to funnel a percentage of all future secondary sales to a given address, in this case, owned by the team that issued the tickets. In this way, fans retain something that may prove to go up in value, and the NBA generates a new stream of passive revenue from secondary market activity. It’s a win-win.  Read More: How the Golden State Warriors Gamified Fandom With NFTs  But even though NFT “ticket stubs” help put money back in the hands of sports teams and fans, since they don’t function as actual tickets and can’t be used to enter a game, they don’t fix other issues with traditional ticketing (e.g., scalpers, high resale prices, fraudulent tickets). As an industry, this is something collectively we need to continue working toward. Over the past few years, major progress has been made when it comes to NFTs and sports games, but in actuality, we’ve only scratched the surface.  Without taking action, the levels of fraud seen around the ticketing industry will not likely go away. Blockchain and NFTs offer a path to solve those exact problems. Offering complete veracity of the credentials will be vital in revolutionizing how access to venues and events happens in the 21st century. However, this is really just the beginning. There’s so much added value that can come to both fans and franchises, and it simply cannot be ignored. Some of these ideas are already being tested out, but a lot more NFT-based ticketing innovation is likely coming, just around the corner.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Josh Katz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/07/29/why-we-need-nft-ticketing-for-sports-events,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/897095555d4cd5b4f8e1ae597647e109d6c0ced6-911x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Past Performance of LINK The LINK price action showcases a sideways continuation between $5.87 and $7.97 after a sharp downfall from $9.24 due to the rejection from the 50-day SMA. However, the recent bullish reversal within the consolidation range with a morning star pattern challenges the overhead resistance and the 100-day SMA.

Hence if the daily candle closes above the $8 mark and the 100-day SMA, the bull run will continue to the next psychological mark of $10. As mentioned before, the bull run challenges the 100-day SMA after exceeding the 50-day average in the daily chart.

For those not deep in the DeFi realm, liquid staking is the act of minting a derivative of an asset that is staked on a blockchain.

While users can typically un-stake their assets if they want to use them for a different purpose, it isn&apos;t always the case.For Ethereum, staking for the purpose of securing the parallel Beacon Chain means the ETH that has been staked is locked up until after the Ethereum merge to Proof of Stake.

42411429,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNkqH,1659116921,Crypto.com and FTX Bet Big on Stadium Naming Rights Before the Crypto Crash. What Happens if They Can’t Afford to Pay?,"As the latest cryptocurrency hype-cycle peaked in 2021, two exchanges that had grown rapidly in just a few years decided to put their names on pro sports stadiums. FTX secured naming rights to the Miami Heat basketball team’s stadium in March 2021 in a reported $135 million, 19-year deal. Crypto.com took an even bigger swing, committing $700 million for 20 years’ worth of naming rights for the former Staples Center, iconic home of the L.A. Lakers, in November 2021.  Cue the sad trombones: November, of course, was the precise peak of the crypto market.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  If those immense financial commitments were made based on assumptions of continued steady growth, the numbers might not be looking so great anymore. And while FTX at least appears financially solid, it’s still unclear whether all of the damage from the crypto-credit bubble burst by Three Arrows Capital has been revealed.  As I wrote at the time, these deals resembled certain prestige-chasing stadium naming deals that came at the height of the dot-com boom: Enron Field and CMGI Field didn’t last very long. History could very easily repeat itself.  But how exactly does a stadium naming deal unwind if, hypothetically, the rights-leaser goes bankrupt? It seems like a real hassle, from taking down all those signs to finding a new sponsor. To find out more, I called Joel Feldman, co-chair of global trademark and brand management at the law firm Greenberg Traurig.  Naming deals are “really not that much different than any sponsorship deal, which is really just an amalgamation of contracts,” said Feldman, who specializes in endorsement deals. “There will be termination provisions, and it will vary from agreement to agreement.”  Naming rights are not property or assets in the conventional sense. In fact, they’re mostly liabilities because they’re usually financed over the long term. In other words, Crypto.com probably didn’t actually hand $700 million over to the Lakers in November.  “There’s not really a ‘one size fits all’ financing,” Feldman said. “But most frequently there’s a startup amount, and then an escalating annual fee.” As a hypothetical example, Feldman said a payment schedule might rise from $22 million in an early year of such a deal up to $30 million five years later.  That’s important because it would mean a naming rights holder that entered restructuring or liquidation – as a grab bag of crypto businesses have over the past four months – would still be on the hook for those payments.  “It’s almost no different than if you sign a 10-year lease and then you’re out of business in three years,” Feldman said. “The landlord goes after the company to get as much as they can, and then they go lease it again.” The exact obligations of the lessor, and the priority of the stadium owner as a creditor in a restructuring, would vary with the specific agreement.  Finding a new naming sponsor in the event of a partner’s collapse is not fun for stadium owners. Not only are there a limited number of sponsors willing to pay for pro-stadium prestige, but the practical elements are more involved than you might guess.  See also: How Is Being in Crypto Like Playing a Sport? | Roundtable  “When you look at every sign that exists with a stadium name on it, [the cost of changing them] does add up,” Feldman said. “Typically, that even includes highway signs” directing visitors to the stadium.  So with all that hassle and risk, how closely do stadiums examine their new partners before signing over naming rights? Feldman said the rigor of a sale’s due diligence varies widely, depending on who owns the stadium. And while the reputation of a partner company matters, it’s not what it used to be.  “Generally, you would think that they would want to have the most respected brands that they can get. The most wholesome, iconic brands in the world, any major sports team would love to have that on their stadium.  “But I think that money talks. And what we’ve seen, especially with crypto, is that [companies] were just willing to pay obscene amounts of money,” Feldman said.  Whether that obscene cash keeps flowing, however, remains to be seen.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION,David Z.

In fact, he thinks the digital currency could be a financial solution for people all over the world and has the potential to be one of the most “influential technological advancements of our time.”  Crognale’s initial venture into bitcoin was in 2020 during the pandemic. He fell down the rabbit hole, and since then, has increased his allocation.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Sports Week.  Crognale, 27, said he receives 25% of his salary from the Birmingham Legion FC of the USL Championship league in bitcoin, up from the original 15%. Last week, Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) fighter Luana Pinheiro joined the handful of pro athletes who receive a portion of their salary in the digital currency.  “I’ve continued to accumulate and buy at these prices, because I see this as a move for my future and somewhere where I can store my wealth and use it down the line,” Crognale said.  “Unless I’m selling bitcoin to buy cash flowing assets or businesses that I believe will outperform bitcoin, I don’t have any plans to sell my coins,” he said.  Crognale uses payroll platform BitWage to receive his bitcoin payments. The cryptocurrency makes up about 80% his portfolio, he says. Some of his alternative investments were held in a Celsius Network account, which he said is likely to go to zero as the crypto broker goes through Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  Read More: 10 Crypto Sports All-Stars  “I have learned not to get caught up in the deception and greed that comes from people and projects who lack good intentions,” he said.  Yet, he is still optimistic about the sector. He says the trend of being paid in bitcoin could become more popular among professional athletes, which says would be a “huge step” for the industry.  “As professional athletes, we can only play for a finite number of years, similar to bitcoin's finite supply,” Crognale said. “To maximize our future earning potential, we need to do as much as we can to secure our money we’re making today for our future.”  Crognale, who is also a co-founder of social impact startup Parichute, said the digital currency “continues to prove the long-term value” it has, pointing to real-world use cases, such as when cryptocurrencies were used by Canadian truckers in their anti-vaccine mandate protests in February and when crypto was donated to help those suffering in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  “For me, it was eye-opening,” he said. “My conviction got higher, even though the price was going lower.”  Read More: Why Sports and Crypto Getting Together Is a Win-Win  Crognale said he plans to host bitcoin mining machines for those looking to invest in bitcoin passively.

42393799,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpBLOd,1659115575,Why Athletes Are Taking Compensation in Bitcoin,"Despite the downturn in the crypto markets where once high-flying companies are going bankrupt, and the pockets of individual retail participants are hurting, more professional athletes are converting their salaries into bitcoin (BTC).  This past week, Brazilian UFC fighter Luana Pinheiro, who has a 10-1-0 record, started collaborating with Bitwage, a company long known for its crypto payroll service, to convert portions of her salary into bitcoin.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Sports Week.  Meanwhile, the New York Yankees recently partnered with NYDIG, a New York-based bitcoin startup, to offer its employees, including players, concession workers and accountants, bitcoin as compensation.  Pinheiro and the Yankees follow in the footsteps of NFL defensive end Alex Barrett and WWE Superstar Summer Rae, who both declared this year they are receiving compensation in bitcoin.  Athletes in a variety of sports are taking bitcoin as compensation, demonstrating the widening appeal of crypto. But they’ve drawn criticism from many who say athletes should not be promoting risky investments so openly.  Darren Rovell, a prominent sports reporter, calculated as of Jan. 23, 2022, that NFL star Odell Beckham Jr., a wide receiver for the 2021 Super Bowl champion Los Angeles Rams, had netted $35,000 on a $750,000 deal (after taxes) because he was paid in bitcoin. And this was calculated in January when BTC was worth $36,000, more than $12,000 than it's worth today.  But athletes say bitcoin compensation is here to stay.  Take Brazilian mixed martial artist Matheus Nicolau.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Nicolau, ranked seventh among UFC flyweights, said, “I truly believe that more and more athletes and workers across the world will start receiving compensation, at least part of that, in bitcoins.”  Bitwage’s metrics corroborate Nicolau’s statement. Bitwage’s transaction volumes have never been higher, according to co-founder and CEO Jonathan Chester, as “people want to receive their salaries in bitcoin or cryptocurrency or stablecoins, and I think that this trend of athletes isn’t going anywhere right now.”  Compensation consultant Fred Whittlesey predicts that athletes accepting crypto as compensation will become more common in two years.  Whittlesey, founder of the Compensation Venture Group, said that eventually athletes being paid in crypto will no longer be news and will be as common as an employee being paid via direct deposits.  But why would these athletes take their earnings in an asset that is roughly a third of its all-time high price back in November 2021?  Long-term PoV for Bitcoin  Athletes are looking beyond the recent dip – which has seen BTC fall from $69,000 to about $24,000 as of this writing – to the longer term.  Pinheiro said, “Think about this: It takes on average 10 to 15 years for an individual to get a black belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, so my time preference here is equally long if not longer. black belt time preference, I call it.”  Buying the top in November 2021, Beckham tweeted: “It’s a NEW ERA & to kick that off I’m hyped to announce that I’m taking my new salary in bitcoin thanks to @CashApp.”  Read More: 10 Crypto All-Stars  New eras last longer than a couple of months. When considering the short careers of athletes, especially ones in MMA fighting and football, it makes sense for athletes to hold BTC as a way to adopt a long investment horizon for their futures.  And, by virtue of converting portions of their salary into BTC, athletes who are already deeply immersed in the sports industry also become included in the Web3 ecosystem.  Announcements about receiving compensation in BTC have “given athletes and teams a way to stand out and a way to show how forward-thinking they are,” according to Kelly Brewster, chief marketing officer at NYDIG. Athletes can build their brand in a new way.  Athletes are learning about branding as a form of career insurance that extends beyond their athletic prowess and enhances the possibility of lifetime income, Whittlesey says.  Nicolau said, “Bitcoin makes our voice stronger,” which enables athletes to create a stronger brand.  Bitcoin fundamentals are attractive  Pinheiro and Nicolau are also motivated by bitcoin benefits like instant access to funds, quicker transaction times and hedging against inflation.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Nicolau brought up Fernando Collor de Mello, former president of Brazil, who seized balances from people’s savings accounts in 1990 to highlight how nobody can seize the BTC in his noncustodial wallet. “If anything happens in the world, our money is saved on our wallet,” Nicolau said.  Read More: How a UFC Heavyweight Champion Became a Crypto Trailblazer  The first time Pinheiro fought in the UFC, logistical difficulties in dealing with her bank in Brazil were abundant. It took more than a month for Pinheiro to have her money in her hands, but now, BTC enters her wallet seamlessly within a few hours through her collaboration with Bitwage.  Moreover, Pinheiro knows “a thing or two about inflation and its effects.” She said, “I was born around 1994. At that time, Brazilian currency real was introduced and pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar. Now it is 5 BRL for 1 USD.”  For Pinheiro and Nicolau, bitcoin is a hedge against inflation.  The best talent  One potential driving motivation for why the Yankees decided to partner with NYDIG and offer their employees BTC may stem from how “employers are in a battle to find and keep talented workers,” according to NYDIG’s 2022 consumer and workforce survey.  From a sample of more than 2,500 full-time employees, “one out of four workers would prefer a company that offers a bitcoin payroll benefit when deciding between equivalent jobs.”  Read More: Micah Johnson: From MLB to NFT Superstar  Twenty percent of workers who took the survey expressed how they would leave their current job for a comparable role at another company that offered compensation in bitcoin.  The U.S. job market is the tightest it has been since the 1950s, according to Bloomberg, and so the recent move to offer BTC by the Yankees can be seen as them developing a competitive edge against other employers.  The Yankees aim to attract and retain the best talent to presumably continue their long history of success, which consists of 27 World Series titles and global recognition.  Sports as a vehicle for bitcoin education  The sports world is looking to play an integral role in educating the public about bitcoin.  Bitcoin is the oldest and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. More people know about bitcoin than any other cryptocurrency, and yet, according to developers, the biggest obstacle for mass adoption is education.  “I see working with Matteus [Nicolau] and Luana [Pinheiro] as part of a greater education effort to help educate people who are thinking about this or have never heard of this,” Chester said.  Not everyone needs to have a technical understanding of the code behind bitcoin as developers do but understanding concepts like what a noncustodial wallet is – and what the technology is attempting to accomplish – is important.  For many in the sports and crypto world, the growing list of athletes taking BTC as compensation will be a main driver for bitcoin’s education.  It will be interesting to see whether the trend of crypto compensation in sports continues. But, for now, these announcements seem to be more about signaling solidarity with crypto than any hope of making outsized money from it.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Sage D.

42374138,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvXxEB,1659115303,Coinbase’s Stock at Crossroads as Cathie Wood’s Ark Sells Some,"Deep value or value trap?  After getting battered by the bear market, shares of Coinbase Global, the world's largest publicly traded crypto exchange, may be in the throes of a tug-of-war between bulls and bears.  The shares have fallen more than 70% so far this year, compared with a 67% decline in the VanEck Digital Transformation ETF and 50% drop in the price of bitcoin (BTC). A combination of the crypto winter, stiff competition and a recent regulatory jolt has contributed to the downturn in the platform that was once regarded as a one-stop shop for all things crypto.  The stock has seen some institutional demand, according to data compiled by Whale Wisdom which tracks quarterly filings that disclose fund managers’ new investments. The data showed that many institutional investors, including Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest, exchange-traded fund issuer Exchange Traded Concepts, Cullinan Associates and Utah-based Refined Wealth Management, collectively bought 2.6 million Coinbase shares in the second quarter.  A few days after that data came out, however, Wood’s Ark Investment Management revealed it had sold more than 1.4 million shares.  While the 1.1 million shares sold by the flagship Ark Innovation fund represented less than 1% of its total investments and the fund still owns almost five million Coinbase shares (according to Ark's holdings data), the sale by Wood's firm nonetheless raises the question of whether now is a good buying opportunity or time to get out.  The bull case  In a bullish scenario, crypto prices would rally and Coinbase would increase its subscription and services products, according to John Todaro, an equity research analyst at investment bank Needham.  Todaro said investors are focused on Coinbase preserving its cash to combat the crypto winter. He added that despite the risks around the stock, he’s in the “bull camp” because of the continued interest from institutions in the crypto sector and the plethora of product use cases by Coinbase. Todaro rates the stock at buy with an $89 price target.  Other bulls acknowledge the volatility in owning Coinbase, but still see the bullish case for investors to gain exposure to the overall crypto ecosystem.  “Investing in Coinbase is not for the faint of heart, as the business – and the stock – will likely see dramatic, potentially protracted swings, because Coinbase’s revenues are currently tightly linked to cryptocurrency asset values, which have historically been cyclical,” Lisa Ellis, an equity analyst at MoffettNathanson, told clients in a note in May when she started coverage of the stock with a buy rating and $200 price target.  “As a stock, we believe Coinbase has enormous scarcity value as a one-of-a-kind, pure expression of the secular cryptocurrency trend,” she said, later adding that Coinbase is “not just any cryptocurrency company – Coinbase is the market leader among Western firms, with deep capabilities in cryptocurrency technology, superior regulatory expertise and a strong brand it can hold its own even among mainstream digital wallets.”  The bear case  In a bear scenario, crypto prices would remain depressed and more “restrictive” regulatory action than expected would continue to soften the demand for crypto, Needham’s Todaro wrote.  In such a scenario, bitcoin would remain below $20,000 for an “extended period on a significant drop in crypto market retail momentum,"" he said.  Some of the bigger Wall Street investment banks have dropped their positive stance toward Coinbase over the last few months, including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. The banks are looking for Coinbase to rein in costs and conserve cash.  “Current crypto asset levels and trading volumes imply further degradation in COIN’s revenue base,” Goldman Sachs analyst Will Nance said in a June note to clients.  Meanwhile, JPMorgan told clients the bank expects Coinbase’s management will be “under pressure to cut costs to drive the firm to profitability.”  Loss of market share has also been an concern amid the sharp decline in crypto prices and increase in global competition. Coinbase’s market share of global trading volume dropped to just 2.9% in July, according to investment bank Mizuho, compared with an average of 5.3% in the first quarter and a peak of 8% to 9% last November.  Absent a near-term crypto price rally, the dust will also need to settle regarding probe by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission into Coinbase allegedly listing unregistered securities.  Despite the uncertainties, some analysts are still cautiously optimistic on Coinbase’s prospects. Shares have already priced in a ton of negative news, and the high amount of short interest may prompt a rally as crypto prices turn higher, according to Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau, who says shares are trading at a “depressed multiple.” He has an outperform rating and a $90 price target.  “COIN's near-term outlook is challenging, but crypto adoption and diversification continue to provide tailwinds longer term,” Lau wrote to clients in a note.  Coinbase declined to comment.

One of those has been a renewed accumulation trend from investors who are flocking to the digital asset to provide cover during uncertain economic times.

While everything is looking green and bullish, XRP is still faced with the $0.381 resistance, and if the coin fails to shoot over that means a correction is looming. A candlestick close that goes under $0.381 can debunk the bearish outlook for XRP. Ripple price showed colossal strength as it ricocheted off a support zone that hereinafter triggered a bullish streak seen in the past two days. While it was looking extremely bullish as it was able to sustain its momentum at $0.37, investors can&apos;t be overconfident as the recent rally could lead to a retracement or an extension.

42374132,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvXx5N,1659110697,Voyager Digital’s Clash With US Regulators Followed by Broader FDIC Warning,"The day after demanding Voyager Digital erase its claims that customers’ funds would get government protections, the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has issued a broader warning to bankers that they need to keep their crypto partners in line.  The agency, which maintains an insurance fund to pay back depositors if their banks fail, doesn’t extend that protection to failing cryptocurrency firms that use those banks, according to an FDIC letter to banks posted Friday.  “FDIC insurance does not protect a nonbank’s customers against the default, insolvency, or bankruptcy of any nonbank entity, including crypto custodians, exchanges, brokers, wallet providers or other entities that appear to mimic banks but are not,” the agency instructed.  The FDIC guidance added that if a bank’s crypto partner “makes misrepresentations about the nature and scope of deposit insurance,” there could be legal risks for that regulated lender.  The FDIC and Federal Reserve sent a letter to Voyager CEO Stephen Ehrlich this week that accused the crypto lender of misleading customers about the protections on their assets by implying that they’d be covered by deposit insurance in the event of Voyager’s collapse. The letter, however, came late for Voyager customers now struggling to get their money back as the company makes its way through bankruptcy court.  The Toronto-based firm had accounts at Metropolitan Commercial Bank in New York, which itself is FDIC-insured, but only in case of a failure of Metropolitan – not Voyager. Now the FDIC is warning that banks such as Metropolitan are responsible for keeping track of what their business partners might be claiming.  “In their dealings with crypto companies, insured banks should confirm and monitor that these companies do not misrepresent the availability of deposit insurance in order to measure and control risks to the bank, and should take appropriate action to address such misrepresentations,” the agency said.

42411747,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfgRx,1659107738,Ethereum Classic: ETC 101,"Ethereum Classic is a blockchain that was created after a contentious hard fork of the Ethereum blockchain took place in 2016.  Like Ethereum, it supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (dapps). Its native asset is referred to as ethereum classic or ETC.  In 2016, blockchain startup slock.it built and launched a decentralized autonomous organization, dubbed The DAO, on the Ethereum blockchain. The DAO was intended to serve as a decentralized venture capital fund for projects launched on Ethereum, and approximately 10,000 people invested more than $168 million in the project through a crowdsale.  See Also: What Is a DAO?  During the course of the crowdsale, several vulnerabilities were identified in The DAO’s code and it was subsequently hacked. The attacker stole approximately $60 million worth of ether, which amounted to roughly 14 percent of all ether at the time.  After much debate within the Ethereum community, a hard fork was executed on block 1,920,000, which altered Ethereum’s code to return the lost funds to investors. However, some Ethereum nodes objected to the fork on the grounds that it would mean that the blockchain would not be immutable, among other reasons, and decided that they would not run the updated software.  These nodes continued to run and mine the pre-fork version of the Ethereum blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic.  In January 2019, Ethereum Classic suffered a 51 percent attack, meaning that a miner (or miners) gained control of the majority of computing power on the network, allowing them to stop or reverse transactions on the blockchain and double-spend coins.  Launch and issuance  Ethereum Classic launched in July 2016. ETC was distributed at a 1:1 ratio for all holders of the Ethereum blockchain’s original currency, ETH, after the fork. This meant that the Ethereum Foundation automatically became a large holder of ethereum classic, though it subsequently sold the majority of its coins. Additionally, it is notable that the hacker of The DAO holds approximately 3.4 million ETC, which represents approximately 4% of the supply.  Network design & security model  Ethereum Classic’s code is an implementation of the original Ethereum blockchain, however the project is not static and continues to develop and change. Whereas, Ethereum will eventually transition from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake mechanism, Ethereum Classic forked its code in 2018 to retain its proof-of-work model.  Monetary policy/cryptoeconomics  Ethereum Classic’s block reward was initially set at 5 ETC and decreases by 20 percent every 5 million blocks (roughly every 2.5 years). ETC is a deflationary currency with a total supply that is not expected to top 230 million coins.  Transaction processing  The block time for Ethereum Classic is roughly 10 to 15 seconds, with an average of 6 transactions processed per block.  Coding  Ethereum Classic is an open source project to which developers can contribute in a variety of programming languages, including Javascript, Python, Go and HTML.",NEUTRAL,ETC,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETC | MINING | FORKS,CoinDesk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/ethereum-classic-etc-101,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1378b36eda3e3e2ab4d3eae47f04f8214d60346b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Claiming to be the first large exchange to offer such a product, KuCoin’s USDT stablecoin-denominated suite of ETFs are being offered in partnership with Fracton Protocol, a service dedicated to fractionalizing valuable NFTs into fungible Ethereum-based ERC-20 tokens, the companies said on Friday.  Blue chip NFTs have dropped in value to some extent, along with everything else in crypto right now, but still, the floor price for something in the BAYC collection is currently around 86 ETH or $144,000, according to CoinGecko  The ERC-20 tokens contained within KuCoin’s NFT funds represent 1/1,000,000 ownership of the BAYC collection, for example, denoted by a hiBAYC token. To start, KuCoin’s “NFT ETF Trading Zone” will first list 5 NFT ETFs covering hiBAYC, hiPUNKS, hiSAND33, hiKODA and hiENS4 as underlying assets as a beginning, the company said in a press release.  As well as lowering the bar for retail investors, using the fund removes the need to manage NFT infrastructure elements, such as wallets and smart contracts, KuCoin added.  “We are very excited to become the first centralized crypto exchange to support NFT ETFs that allow users to conveniently invest and trade top NFTs directly with USDT. In the future, KuCoin will keep exploring more NFT-related products for our users,” said KuCoin CEO Johnny Lyu in a statement.  KuCoin currently provides spot trading, margin trading, P2P fiat trading, futures trading, staking, and lending to its 20 million users in 207 countries and regions.

42374139,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvXxGh,1659103424,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Heads for Best Month Since October as PCE Inflation Surprises,"Price Point: Bitcoin is on track for its best month since October as a busy week for U.S. economic news ends with a fresh inflation surprise.  Market Moves: Ethereum classic (ETC), a cryptocurrency that's been little more than an afterthought since the same-named protocol forked off the Ethereum blockchain in 2016, was one of the best performers in digital-asset markets in July.  Chart of The Day: Bitcoin futures premium widens as rally takes off.  This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) held steady even as fresh U.S. economic data showed the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation rose by more than expected in June.  The core personal consumption price index (core PCE) came in at 0.6% month on month, exceeding estimates for a 0.5% rise and accelerating from May's 0.3% jump. The pace over the past 12 months was 4.8%, compared with expectations for a rate of 4.7%. The employment cost index rose 1.3% in the second quarter, versus the expected 1.2%.  While the data pointed to sticky inflation, the news barely impacted the dollar or U.S. Treasury yields, perhaps because markets remain focused on recession fears and prospects of slower Federal Reserve monetary tightening in coming months.  SPECIAL FEATURE: What is the definition of a recession? And does the U.S. economy meet the test? The discussion has suddenly become a parlor game among analysts and politicians alike. Helene Braun explains. (Spoiler alert: The bitcoin market doesn't really care one way or another.)  Bitcoin traded at $23,550 at 12:45 coordinated universal time (UTC) on Friday, representing a 3% gain on a 24-hour basis.  The cryptocurrency, however, was on track to end a three-month losing streak with at least an 18% gain – the biggest percentage rise since October. The relief could be attributed to speculation that inflation has peaked and the Federal Reserve could opt for slower interest rate hikes in the coming months.  While ether (ETH) fell below $1,700, the native token of Ethereum’s blockchain was still up 57% for the month, the biggest rise since October.  Cardano’s ADA token underperformed as Input Output (IOG), the development lab for the Cardano blockchain, pushed back Vasil, an upgrade designed to increase Cardano's scaling capabilities, by a few weeks. The Vasil upgrade had been scheduled for a June release on testnet release followed by mainnet launch.  Babel withdrawal suspension  In related news, bitcoin holder El Salvador's Finance Minister Alejandro Zelaya said the country's decision to adopt the leading cryptocurrency by market value as legal tender is helping the unbanked population and attracting tourism and investments. The comments come as the country's finances look weak, with a 50% loss on its bitcoin investments ahead of the $800 million sovereign bond due in January 2023.  A report published by The Block, citing a restructuring proposal deck, said the beleaguered Hong Kong-based crypto lender Babel Finance lost $280 million in proprietary trades with customer funds. Babel Finance suspended withdrawals and redemptions, citing market volatility and hired U.S. investment banking firm Houlihan Lokey to help chalk out a restructuring plan. Babel is one of the several crypto companies, suffering from the “crypto contagion” following the collapse of Terra and the crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.

Spanish banking multinational Santander said it was planning to offer crypto products to its clients in Brazil, a sign of continued appetite for digital assets amid the bear market.  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Chainlink LINK +9.5% Computing Gala GALA +6.0% Entertainment Polygon MATIC +4.5% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Cosmos ATOM −1.1% Smart Contract Platform  Market Moves  Ethereum classic – No, not THAT Ethereum – boasts powerful performance in July crypto comeback  July has brought relief to the crypto market, thanks in part to Ethereum classic (ETC), the supposedly dead coin and not-so-similar clone of Ethereum's ether (ETH) token.  The gains for ETC came as other out-of-favor coins like UNI and MATIC joined the recovery in digital assets with at least $1 billion market value.  ETC has added 184% this month, while scaling system Polygon's MATIC and decentralized exchange Uniswap's UNI have gained 102% and 86% respectively, CoinDesk data shows. Industry leader bitcoin (BTC) added 20% during the month, with ether up 60%. The total crypto market capitalization has rebounded to $1.14 trillion from last month's $762.82 billion low.  The catalyst for ETC's gains has been Ethereum's impending Merge, a planned step to convert the Ethereum network's proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain to a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain. Ethereum's Beacon Chain has been running since 2020.  ""ETC is being driven by speculation that ETH miners will go to ETC and, potentially, there could be another hard fork benefitting them,"" Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock, said.  ETC's July gain is consistent with a history of rallying around the time of major Ethereum upgrades.  Full story here: Ethereum Classic Almost Triples, MATIC and UNI Surge as July Brings Relief to Crypto Market  Chart of the Day  Bitcoin futures premium widens  Bitcoin’s price rise this month has been accompanied by an uptick in the futures premium or the spread between prices in futures and spot markets.  The annualized rolling premium in three-month bitcoin futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a proxy for institutional activity, has risen to 4.2% from near zero at the beginning of the month.  While premium in three-month bitcoin futures listed on Binance has increased, it remains below that on the CME, a sign sentiment remains cautious on the retail-dominated offshore platforms.  Perhaps that's a good sign for the market as retail-driven price rallies seldom have legs.

42374128,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvXx0L,1659100312,"BNB, Solana Lead Gains in Majors; Traders Point to Dollar Strength for Further Upside","Crypto markets added some 5% to overall capitalization in the past 24 hours as bitcoin broke the $24,000 level and ether neared $1,700 as majors continued a run from Wednesday.  Bitcoin closed above its 50-day moving average for the second straight day, suggesting further upside if current buying pressure continues. Ether jumped 5%, while BNB and Solana’s SOL led majors with gains of more than 7%.  Some traders, including FxPro markets analyst Alex Kuptsikevich, said the recovery has come amid demand for risky assets and a pullback of the dollar from multiyear highs.  “However, the longer-term and whole picture is working against the buyers,” Kuptsikevich cautioned. “As long as we see tightening monetary and economic conditions, the crypto market has to move against the tide.”  Some traders pointed out fresh rate hikes earlier this week added to buying pressure on cryptocurrencies. The U.S. Federal Reserve increased rates by 75 basis points in an expected move on Wednesday, which caused a run across crypto and equity markets and led to more than $200 million's worth of crypto futures seeing liquidations on Thursday.  “The economy saw the 75-basis-point hike as a bold move that could help slow down inflation faster,” explained Damian Scavo, CEO of algorithmic trading-platform Streetbeat. “Crypto is starting to correlate with the stock market and in general, with the global economy. It means that the crypto market is reaching a certain level of maturity.”  Mikkel Mørch, executive director at ARK36, said traders were already expecting lower hikes, which contributed to recovery since last week.  “The Fed specializes in communicating its position beforehand to avoid a knee-jerk reaction from the markets following the announcement of its policy decisions,” he said.  Mørch added that the firm was watching the strength of the U.S. dollar, which could affect the price movements of cryptocurrencies. “Since the next hike doesn't come until September, there may be some room for upside now – although that will be contingent on the strength of the dollar and the wider macro environment,” he said.  In the past few weeks, the value of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies reached its highest level since the early 2000s, even equaling the euro's value for the first time in two decades.  Policymakers have claimed a strong dollar could even help bring down U.S. inflation. This is because a relatively strong dollar decreases the costs of importing goods for the American consumer, which, in turn, could help bring down inflation since prices are lower.  Not everyone is convinced of the upside, however. “Until the economy breaks either up or down, not much is going to happen,” opined Chris Terry, vice president at crypto-lending platform SmartFi. “We anticipate that bitcoin will continue to trade in this tight range of $20,000 plus or minus 10 percent to 15%.”  “None of this should be a surprise,"" Terry concluded. ""We could be in this stalled market for weeks and weeks.

Testing for “inevitable issues” was taking place and any problems were being fixed by the development team.  “All users have to be ready to progress through the hard fork to make sure the smooth process, both for them and end users of the Cardano blockchain,” Hammond said.  Vasil, an upgrade designed to increase Cardano's scaling capabilities, had been scheduled for a June release on a test network followed by its introduction on the main network. A hard fork is a backward-incompatible change to the software used to validate and produce new blocks.  The team had earlier flagged seven bugs that prevented developers from releasing Vasil as planned in June. “This puts us behind schedule on our previously communicated target date of June 29 for a mainnet hard fork,” they said at the time.  The final decision to upgrade the Cardano testnet will be made in consultation with the network’s decentralized application (dapp) development community. Before that, developers must clear any critical issues in testing, conduct benchmarking tests and inform the broader developer community to allow enough time to test their dapps before the hard fork is implemented.

Alejandro Zelaya said in an interview with Bloomberg on Wednesday that bitcoin adoption has been beneficial to El Salvador's unbanked population and also attracted tourism and investments. ""It's a phenomenon that exists and is gaining ground and will continue to be around in the coming years,"" he said.  From September last year to the start of this month, El Salvador has purchased 2,301 BTC for a total of $103.9 million. As of the start of July, its portfolio was worth $46.6 million, a decline of over 55%. With the recent uptick in the crypto markets, the portfolio is now worth around $55.3 million.  El Salvador has faced criticism from mainstream financial institutions for its crypto adoption. In January, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) urged the country to discontinue bitcoin's legal tender status.  ""New technologies have shown how people in previous years were afraid of things like websites and digital business, but it's been show through time that reality imposes itself,"" Zelaya added.  El Salvador had plans earlier this year to introduce a $1 billion bitcoin bond but postponed it in March due to unfavorable market conditions.

42374137,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvXxCv,1659089769,"Ethereum Classic Almost Triples, MATIC and UNI Surge as July Brings Relief to Crypto Market","July has brought relief to the crypto market, with ethereum classic (ETC), the supposedly dead coin and not-so-similar clone of Ethereum's ether (ETH) token, and other out-of-favor coins like UNI and MATIC leading the recovery in digital assets with at least $1 billion market value.  ETC has added 184% this month, while scaling systemPolygon's MATIC and decentralized exchange Uniswap's UNI have gained 102% and 86% respectively, CoinDesk data show. Industry leader bitcoin (BTC) had added 20% and ether 60% at press time. The total crypto market capitalization has rebounded to $1.14 trillion from last month's $762.82 billion low.  Analysts said coin-specific factors are at play alongside the broader market risk reset.  Ethererum's merge powers ETC rally  ""ETC is being driven by speculation that ETH miners will go to ETC and potentially, there could be another hard fork benefitting them,"" Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock, said. The driver for the move is Ethereum's impending Merge to shift from the network's proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain to a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain. Ethereum's Beacon Chain has been running since 2020 as part of that process.  After the Merge, likely to happen on Sept. 19, Ethereum will start operating as a PoS chain, requiring market participants known as validators to stake, or hold, a minimum number of coins to confirm transactions in return for rewards. In a PoW system miners solve a computational problem to verify transactions.  The merge means Ethereum miners will have to find a new home, most likely Ethereum Classic, which is supposedly the only chain compatible with the Ethereum mining machinery.  ""Ethereum's mining network is made up of two types of hardware: ASICs and GPUs,"" Messari's Sami Kasab said in a research report. ""The problem with ASICs is that they can't be repurposed for different applications besides mining ETH. Ethereum Classic is the only other PoW coin that can be mined with an ETH ASIC, since its hashing algorithm is compatible with ETH's algorithm.""  Recently, AntPool, the Bitmain-affiliated mining pool, invested $10 million to support the Ethereum Classic ecosystem. Ethereum Classic is a hard-forked version of Ethereum, born from a hack of The DAO, a smart contract operating on the Ethereum blockchain, in 2016.  ETC's July gain is consistent with a history of rallying around the time of major Ethereum upgrades.  ""ETC's April 2021 rally coincided with Ethereum's Berlin upgrade. Similarly, ETC seems to be rallying on the back of expectations related to the Merge,"" Toronto-based crypto platform FRNT Financial said in an email, adding that investors may see ETC as a hedge against potential difficulties in the change.  ETC was priced at a 3 1/2-month high of $45 on major exchanges early today.  Polygon makes the right noise  MATIC seems to be reaping rewards from Polygon's expansion plans and partnership announcements.  The scaling system earmarked $20 million to help projects migrating to its platform from the Terra blockchain. Disney (DIS) said earlier this month that Polygon was one of the six companies selected for a business-development accelerator program. Furthermore, Polygon said it was building a zkEVM, or zero-knowledge system, in a bid to slash transaction fees by 90% in comparison with Ethereum.  According to FRNT Financial, the zkEVM plan has added to enthusiasm in the ecosystem.  Polygon facilitates faster and cheaper transactions by running sidechains, or tangential networks, alongside the main Ethereum blockchain. Scaling refers to increasing the system's throughput, as measured by transactions per second.  MATIC neared $1 early Friday, the highest since May 9.  Uniswap's bullish fee switch  While UNI is not the only decentralized finance (DeFi)-associated token to rally, its outperformance may result from the Uniswap community's decision to approve a ""fee switch"" proposal that directs a portion of trading fees to the UNI holders.  Once the proposal is implemented, about 10% of trading fees could go to UNI holders, according to Ilan Solot, a partner at crypto hedge fund TagusCapital. Currently, they do not get any share in the protocol's revenue, contrary to SUSHI token and CRV token holders. The entire amount collected from the exchange's 0.3% trading cost goes to liquidity providers.  ""UNI holders voted overwhelmingly in favor of the proposal; now it's a question of implementation. It looks like it would be 10% of trading fees, estimated at $20K-40K per day for the treasury. Obviously, this had a positive impact on the UNI token,"" Solot wrote in Thursday's daily market update.  UNI was changing hands at $8.90 at the time of writing, having touched a 3 1/2-month high of $9.84 on Thursday.",POSITIVE,ETC | MATIC | UNI,BLOCKCHAIN | ETC | MARKET | MATIC | UNI,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/29/ethereum-classic-almost-triples-matic-and-uni-surge-as-july-brings-relief-to-crypto-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2e02b31962a2a69ec38869ad7a641a30015f37ca-1551x1164.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) is down.  But crypto investors have been liking what they've been hearing lately about inflation-busting efforts and the possible economic path forward as bitcoin, ether and most other major digital assets climbed handsomely for a third consecutive day.  Bitcoin was recently trading at nearly $23,900, a more than 4% gain over the past 24 hours as markets continued to embrace the latest steps by the U.S. central bank to quell inflation and indicators showing the economy slowing but not falling into recession. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization cracked $24,000 for the first time in more than a week at one point despite GDP tumbling more steeply than expected.  Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap behind bitcoin, jumped over $1,700 for the first time since early June. Other major cryptos were deeply in the green with ETC and BCH both up more than 20% at one point.  ""Risk appetite is roaring back after a second consecutive contraction for the US economy raises the chances that the Fed could be looking to tighten at a softer pace at the next policy meeting in September,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst Americas for Oanda, wrote in an email.  Moya noted gains in equity markets that also rose for a third consecutive day with the tech-focused Nasdaq, S&P 500, which has a heavy tech component, and Dow Jones Industrial Average all rising over a percentage point. But he also struck a cautionary note, writing that although the rally for risky assets was a boon for crypto, ""traders should not be surprised if stocks ""eventually faded.""  Economic uncertainty  Thursday's GDP report spurred more uncertainty about a global economy that has suffered one stomach punch after another for more than nine months. GDP declined at an annualized pace of 0.9% in the second quarter, marking two consecutive quarters of economic contraction, which many economists have traditionally defined as a recession. The data released on Thursday morning by the U.S. Commerce Department was worse than consensus forecasts of a 0.5% contraction, but was slightly better than ""whisper"" expectations for a decline of 1% or more. GDP plunged 1.6% in the first quarter.  However, many economists – and even Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen – have refrained from calling a recession because other factors like the labor market show signs of a strong economy. Both the government and the Fed defer to the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) to declare a recession, which takes into account employment, personal income and industrial production, in addition to GDP.  Yellen told reporters on Thursday following the GDP announcement the definition of a recession is a “broad-based weakening of the economy,” and “that is not what we’re seeing right now.”  On Wednesday, investors had reacted favorably to the U.S. central bank's 75 basis point rate hike and dovish signals by Powell that the Fed might not have to raise rates in a few months.  Meanwhile, the crypto bankruptcy roll call lengthened on Thursday with beleaguered crypto exchange Zipmex filing applications in Singapore seeking protection amid the threat of legal action from creditors. Zipmex's solicitors, Morgan Lewis Stamford, filed five applications on July 22 on behalf of the firm's different entities seeking moratoriums on legal proceedings for up to six months.  Crypto lender Voyager Digital was ordered by U.S. banking regulators to stop making incorrect claims that the company was insured by the government. Voyager Digital filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in a U.S. court earlier this month.  Oanda's Moya will be looking for bitcoin to at least hold its current upper threshold as a sign that the crypto winter ""is truly over.""  ""Bitcoin is facing tentative resistance at the $24,000 level, but if that can’t contain the bulls price could extend towards the $27,500 region,"" he wrote.

Insights  What Will Drive a Real Bitcoin Rally?  By Sam Reynolds  Bitcoin is up again after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced that it’s raising interest rates by 75 basis points to combat persistent inflation, meeting and but exceeding expectations.  Bitcoin responded by rising 10% in the immediate hours after the announcement and more than 5% on Thursday at one point to rise over $24,000 for the first time in more than a week.  Seeing the entire board in green is a nice change from the bear markets: a sea of red and daily declines.  But the $24,000 threshold is a long way from where we all thought it would be given the institutional support and interest it has. So how does it break out from this slump?  Stakeholders aren’t quite sure. Everyone knows that bitcoin is a risk asset. But is its fate forever tied to equities? After all, bitcoin’s first use case, and rally, was in 2013 when Cypriot depositors used it as an asset to preserve capital in times of risk – a stark contrast to it being a risky asset. Speaking at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2022 festival, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz said that bitcoin isn’t going to “trade well before the Fed flinches and takes its foot off the break” and thinks that it will bottom out before U.S. equities do.  “My hope is that by the fourth quarter, the economy will be slowing enough that the Fed says we are going to pause, and then you will see the next crypto cycle start,” he said. “Then bitcoin will break from equities and lead markets.”  Bill Cannon, head of ETF portfolio management at digital asset fund manager Valkyrie Investments, sees bitcoin as being tied to equities and the macro environment dictating its price for the foreseeable future.  “Most signs point to the U.S. being in a recession, despite Chair Powell repeatedly insisting otherwise, and confirmation of that will likely send assets south,” Cannon said in an email to CoinDesk.  Recession, yes?  Cannon wrote there were two things that stuck out to the firm: Fed Chairman Jerome Powell declining to provide further rate guidance in advance of the September FOMC meeting, and also saying that ""we need to have a period of growth below potential to create slack as well as a softening job market.""  “That sounds an awful lot like a recession, and we expect it to last longer than many people think – this will send all risk assets lower including Bitcoin and other digital assets,” Cannon wrote.  Despite the fact that Powell declined to provide rate guidance, others see this most recent rate hike meeting – not exceeding – expectations as the first sign of a more dovish Fed.  “We are seeing a very clean breakout to the upside, which started ahead of the data, seeing institutions taking heavy positions on the back of a more dovish FED stance,"" assets brokerage Secure Digital markets wrote in a Telegram channel, CoinDesk previously reported.  The number keeps going up, but what puts it back to where it once was clearly remains a mystery.
