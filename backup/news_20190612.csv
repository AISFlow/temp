A Square Twitter account teased the news Wednesday afternoon without specifying what Lee's role at the company would be. A spokesperson for Square declined to comment.  The maker of the bitcoin-friendly Cash app led by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey announced it was hiring a crypto team in March. At the time, Dorsey said the new roles would be focusing not on Square’s own commercial interests, but rather “on what’s best for the crypto community.”  Lee, who left Google in 2015 after eight years at the search giant, has since become a Bitcoin Optech contributor. He's also an angel investor who lists Lyft, Pinterest and Yardbarker as key exits.

42382122,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qd2F,1560373248,"Few Women Are Contributing Code to Major Crypto Projects, Report Finds","Using data collected  from from Github, a study found the top 100 blockchain projects in the cryptocurrency ecosystem showed deep lack of gender diversification, with women committing only about five percent of code.  The study, conducted by journalist Corin Faife, reportedly checked over 1 million code commits in GitHub to identify participation of open-source contributors that could be identified as women. The investigation showed a total of 4.64% of female names in the main branches for each of these projects, a percentage that isn't unusual in the cryptocurrency world.  Minding the Gap  Using the GitHub API, a custom Python script, and Genderize.io, Faife dug through a million lines to find contributor names in each project.  The gender-based investigation checked a total of 1,026,804 lines of code in the repositories, collecting users real names and identifying their gender using the Genderize service .  He pointed his tool at code in major projects like TRON and Binance and found that the database showed 54 projects had less than 100 commits made by women while 31 had less than ten.  Although the results couldn't identify all the users - some of them didn't provide a real name in their account or had a name of ambiguous gender - the overall percentage of male names was as high as 67.3%.  Faife also found that blockchain project Bytom and asian projects like NEO and Theta Token exhibited far more code changes signed by female developers.  Room For Change  The numbers found by Faife support the statistics of gender disparity reported by previous studies in the technology field. According to a study conducted by in 2017 GitHub, 95% of open source collaborators were male.  The GitHub study noted that the lack of inclusion also represents a problem for women who work in tech since many job search firms scan online projects to find potential employees.  The blockchain space has already shown a deep lack of female representation, as pointed out by a recent investigation that found that new blockchain startups in 2019 had only 14.5% women as team members and only 7% in executive positions.  Other companies like Circle and eToro have also found a strong disparity between the number of male and female cryptocurrency investors, with women representing far less than half of the participants in both studies.

42382101,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qcjN,1560364247,Power Move Before Power Lunch: Tron CEO Switches Venue for Buffett Meeting,"Tron CEO Justin Sun is moving his $4.6 million lunch date with Warren Buffett to “the heartland of tech"" aka Silicon Valley. This is the first time since the annual “power lunch” tradition started in 2000 that the meal will take place in San Francisco.  “We want this lunch to be a bridge between the cryptocurrency community and the traditional investor,” Sun said to Yahoo Finance on Monday, who is trying to draw Buffett out of his comfort zone.  Indeed, the traditional investor is as conservative in taste as in investments.  Smith & Wollensky steakhouse in New York City has hosted the Buffett luncheons since 2004, where the Oracle of Omaha reportedly orders the same medium-rare steak with hash browns and a cherry coke, according to an interview with CNBC.  “It might be unrealistic to convince Warren Buffett, in just three hours, to buy cryptocurrencies,” said Sun. “But we want to show him the recent progress of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. It’s not only about Tron itself, it’s about crypto and blockchain, the whole industry.”  Though Buffett has expressed doubts about cryptocurrency in the past – most recently calling it “a gambling device” at his annual shareholders’ convention – he told Bloomberg that “I’m delighted with the fact that Justin has won the lunch and am looking forward to meeting him and his friends.”  Sun previously said he will invite seven crypto industry leaders to the event.  The meeting will take place at an undisclosed restaurant in the Bay Area on July 25. In years past, Smith & Wollensky has donated $10,000 to Glide, the anti-poverty charity the auction is set up to benefit.  Sun committed to donating an additional $100,000 to Glide, which directs its efforts to homelessness in the Bay Area.  Sun told Yahoo Finance the lunch was bought with ad revenue from BitTorrent, the file streaming service that Tron bought last July. Originally billed as a blockchain platform for the entertainment industry, Tron’s cryptocurrency Tronix (TRX) is mostly used for sports gambling. It is the 12th largest coin by market capitalization.  In addition to running the Tron Foundation, Sun is CEO of Peiwo, a Chinese social platform built around voice recognition. He was also an early investor in Tesla, another company Buffett bet against.

Schnider’s appointment to the Zug based firm will begin summer 2019, about six months after investment executive and adjunct professor of financial ethics Fiole filled the position. Fiole was hired during a period of executive expansion, which Tezos Foundation President Ryan Jesperson called at the time, “an important step forward by strengthening its internal expertise and capabilities.”  A leader within the blockchain community since its record-setting $232 million ICO in July 2017, Tezos has also been wracked by internal and external conflict.  The Etherium-like distributed, peer-to-peer, permissionless network delayed the distribution of its tokens due to internal miscommunication. Additionally, three lawsuits were filed in November 2017 accusing the Tezos Foundation of false advertising and securities fraud, as XTZ tokens were sold but not registered as securities.  Schnider first became familiar with Tezos protocol in July 2018, when he was hired to perform an independent, external audit of the firm, cited as the first time a major U.S. accounting firm worked with a large-scale blockchain organization.  At the time, the Tezos Foundation commented, “We believe that accountability and trust will be central pillars of any successful entity operating in the blockchain space.”  Schnider will join the Tezos Foundation after over 14 years at PwC, where he served as financial director. In 2016, he launched the department for blockchain and cryptocurrency assurance.  “Roman’s experience makes him the ideal finance and operations specialist for our team. He is already familiar with the opportunities and challenges blockchain projects face and has a deep understanding of the Tezos Foundation from his time at PwC Switzerland,” said Jesperson, in a statement.  Before joining the Tezos Foundation, Fiole spent more than twenty years in the financial services industry, including co-founding Alpha Governance Partners, an international risk-governance focused fiduciary services firm. He has not said where he will go next.  “We want to thank Eelco for his contribution to the development of the Foundation and wish him all the best,""Jesperson said.

42382129,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qd61,1560355202,Napster Founder's IoT Startup to Go Crypto With $15 Million Series C,"An internet-of-things (IoT) startup founded in 2013 is adding tokens to its business model with the backing of two of crypto's best-known funders.  Helium  announced Wednesday a $15 million Series C co-led by Union Square Ventures and Multicoin Capital. Investors will acquire equity in Helium as well as a share of the tokens that will accrue to the company over the next several years as they are minted, after its bespoke blockchain goes live, according to a spokesperson.  Previous investors that participated in the latest round included Khosla Ventures, GV (formerly Google Ventures), FirstMark Capital and German reinsurance giant Munich Re. The new round brings Helium's total funding so far to just under $54 million.  Helium was founded to create a low-cost data network that IoT devices could access using consumer WiFi as its backend. The company sees current ways of getting IoT data back to firms that need it as too expensive. By driving down those costs, Helium says its network could challenge traditional telecommunications infrastructure.  But the company has come to see tokens as a necessary ingredient for spurring adoption.  ""When we started the business in 2013, the goal was always to try to build this big broad network that everybody could use,"" Helium CEO and founder Amir Haleem told CoinDesk, adding:  ""We arrived at this conclusion a few years ago that crypto was the best model for what we've been building.""  Last year, Helium released a white paper for a decentralized wireless network that uses publicly available radio frequency to solve the last-mile problem of connecting IoT devices and the public internet.  Haleem founded the company alongside peer-to-peer pioneer Shawn Fanning (of Napster fame, also an investor in Uber and Square) and Chris Bruce (who sold an IoT company called Sproutling to Mattel).  The company sells its Helium Hotspot for $495. The device connects to users' existing home WiFi networks and serves as a hub for IoT devices in the area to feed data back to Helium's databases. By using low-power radio waves, the device provides a low-cost way to feed small amounts of data back to a central database.  Several initial partners will be using the product. Lime, the e-bike and scooter company, will use it for tracking its devices, Agulus will use it to collect agricultural sensor data and Nestlé will use it to track inventory in vending machines.  According to telecommunications giant Ericsson, there are over 1 billion connected devices in the world as of 2018, with that number projected to quadruple in less than a decade. Most of these connected devices rely on the lowest-level cellular connection, 2G.  “Everyday things that we use shouldn’t need cellular plans,” Haleem said in a press release.  For Multicoin, it's the Austin-based venture firm's largest investment to date. Tushar Jain, a Multicoin co-founder, told CoinDesk:  ""I think Helium is the most ambitious and interesting vision I've seen in the blockchain space since ethereum itself.""  Token model  The Helium blockchain actually has two tokens: helium and data credits.  Data credits are only earned by burning helium. Once created, data credits can never leave the wallet that created them, except to be spent on the Helium network for transferring data. The cost of sending a data packet will always be the same in data credit terms, according to Haleem.  Helium hotspots mine helium tokens in various ways, such as by performing operations that secure the network and also by providing useful services. These operations include: proving that nodes are all located where they claim to be, proving the sequence in which data is transferred and proving the location of devices using it.  Helium also uses a structure similar to delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS), called ""Proof-of-Coverage,"" where the nodes proven to be the most reliable over time verify blocks and earn some portion of inflation for doing so. Helium declined to estimate how long it might take for a hotspot owner to recoup the cost of a hotspot.  There's no pre-mine and no supply cap on helium, according to the company. For the first several years, a diminishing piece of the monthly supply will go to Helium as the ""founder's reward,"" and the company can use some portion of this as a supply for its first customers. The portion starts at 10 percent and diminishes annually.  Some 50,000 new tokens are minted every month but in order to use the network helium also has to be burned – so the supply will continuously be contracted, provided it has users. Haleem foresees a future where, when the network is mature, it should reach something like an equilibrium state where tokens are burned each month at roughly the point they are created.  ""The usage of the network is what creates the economics,"" Haleem said.  How it works  To join the network, a user needs to buy the Helium Hotspot, which is on sale now.  ""We have limited quantity of these things going on sale,"" Haleem said. ""If you're an early participant in the network, your rewards are outsized.""  The hotspot connects to a user's wireless router. It then sends and receives data from IoT devices in the area. Each hotspot has a considerably greater range than a WiFi node, but the tradeoff is that it can't carry as much data. That's fine, though, for devices that just need to send small packets of data occasionally.  The company estimates that 50 to 100 hotspots can cover an entire city. Helium says it has good coverage on a current beta test in San Francisco with around 10.  As explained in the Helium white paper, the network operates in the unlicensed sub-gigahertz spectrum. The basic technology to send and receive this kind of signal is well-established and mature, with multiple vendors providing compatible equipment.  All communications use public key encryption. Helium's protocol is purpose-built for its use case. All transactions occur on-chain and settle quickly thanks to its Proof-of-Coverage architecture. There's no smart contracting language to create additional chaos on the network.  The fight ahead  Asked if Multicoin would also be buying any hotspots, Jain said, ""Let's just say: Austin is covered.""  He went further, adding:  ""The thing that I'm really excited about here is the connectivity being permissionless. You don't need to create an account with anyone.""  If an IoT device is associated with a helium wallet, it can use the network anywhere it exists in the world, which Jain pointed out makes hardware creation much easier than the status quo, where different products have to be designed for different telcos everywhere a company wants to use them.  In fact, Haleem very much sees his company as taking aim at the telecommunications giants. Once it proves out the IoT use case, Helium wants to pursue others.  ""This is like a blueprint for how you might deploy an LTE network or a 5G deployment,"" he said. ""You providing your neighbor with 5G makes more sense than the telcos doing it.""  Helium is not alone in this market, however.  Telecommunications giants have their Narrowband IoT products, for example.  France's Sigfox is arguably the best-known startup for IoT devices with low data demand. It's raised €277 million, according to CrunchBase, and similarly relies on public radio spectrum. Open Garden also allows users to share their internet access with neighbors in exchange for small, automated payments.  Helium sees a competitive advantage in its architecture, however, allowing the market to determine where to deploy and permitting users to send data with per-packet pricing, as needed.  Haleem said:  ""We view our pricing model as something like 1,000 times better than what the cell companies are offering.""

According to a June 6 news release from Maersk, the Danish shipping and logistics giant, agreement has been reached with Russian authorities for the TradeLens platform to operate in the country, starting with a pilot project alongside the country's primary container gateway, the port of St. Petersburg.  TradeLens allows container logistics industry participants to have a shared view of shipping transaction data, with member firms acting as nodes to support the blockchain system. With the move into Russia, Maersk said the project aims to facilitate interactions between shippers and regulatory and administrative entities in the country, ""ultimately increasing the speed of cargo clearance and movement of goods across borders.""  At the signing of a memorandum of understanding over the arrangement last week, Yuriy Tsvetkov, Russia's deputy transport minister and head of Federal Maritime and River transport Agency, said:  “The main result of the implementation of TradeLens, according to our expectations, should be an increase in the transparency of the contracting procedure by distributing information about supply and demand, conditions and operations between many participants of the transport and logistics processes.”  The agreement enables the entry of TradeLens into the Russian market, with the aim of introducing digital documentation flow in what are currently largely paper-based shipping industry processes.  TradeLens will bring ""full transparency of cargo moves, while enabling seamless, secure sharing of real-time actionable supply chain information to all involved participants,"" said Mike White, CEO and head of TradeLens for Maersk GTD.  While TradeLens had been struggling to pick up major shipping collaborators, partly due to the way the venture was set up to favor the founding firms, changes in the business structure have now seen two major carriers come aboard. The new additions are Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), the second largest after Maersk; and CMA-CGM, the fourth largest in terms of cargo carrying capacity.  Maersk said the platform now has more than 100 participants and is processing over ""10 million discrete shipping events and thousands of documents each week.""

42382113,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qcuh,1560340810,Insurer L&G Uses Amazon Blockchain Service for Pension Deals,"A U.K. insurer has turned to Amazon's services to launch what it claims is the first blockchain system for bulk pension deals.  According to a Reuters report Wednesday, Legal & General, a U.K.based multinational financial services company, has said it will use Amazon Web Services' (AWS) managed blockchain system to manage and record bulk annuities for its insurance business.  Bulk annuities are defined benefit pensions schemes sold by companies to insurers to mitigate risks to policy holders and to free themselves from the cost burden.  For now, AWS' blockchain platform will be used for Legal & General's bulk annuity business outside the U.K. and the U.S., although it may be expanded to include those markets down the road, a spokesperson for the firm told Reuters.  Thomas Olunloyo, CEO of Legal & General Reinsurance, explained that blockchain tech suits the long-term nature of annuities, as contracts can last over 50 years. Blockchain allows the related data and transactions ""to be signed, recorded and maintained in a permanent and secure nature over the lifetime of these contracts,"" he said.  Insurance  is a growing use case for blockchain, with firms in the space increasingly eyeing the tech for its potential transparency and efficiency gains.  In December, U.S. insurance group State Farm launched a trial of a blockchain solution to streamline the manual process of subrogation – the legal right for companies to pursue damages from a third-party responsible for causing a loss to the insured party.  And a group of insurance companies completed a blockchain trial in China this spring that investigated the security and traceability features of blockchain, partly as a means to help to solve credibility issues facing insurance firms in the country.  The same month, professional services firm Accenture and Italian insurance group Generali launched a live blockchain solution aimed to streamline Generali’s Employee Benefits Network offerings, including insurance cover for life, disability, accident and healthcare.  AWS' managed blockchain service came out of preview mode in early May, allowing clients to start using it to build solutions. The firm said at the time the service allows users to create a blockchain network ""in minutes,"" as well as managing certificates, inviting new members and scaling out peer node capacity to speed up transaction processing.

In an interview aired on national television, the Brazilian president commented on cryptocurrency being used to bank indigenous people in Brazil. During a conversation centered on the challenges of his new presidency, Bolsonaro talked about projects created by his predecessor's administration. One of the efforts was a $11.5 million project that aimed to create an “indigenous cryptocurrency”.  “We are cutting expenses. We were about to use 40 million Reales to teach natives to use bitcoin,” he said. In fact, Bolsonaro said, he doesn't even know what bitcoin is.  “I don’t know,"" he said. ""Is it a coin?”  The National Indian Foundation (Funai) and the Fluminense Federal University (UFF) created the project in order help bank Brazil's indigenous people. The country’s Ministry of Human Rights, Family and Womenvetoed it in January.  The shutdown of the cryptocurrency project was one of the first actions taken by Bolsonaro’s administration. This is the first time the leader commented about bitcoin in public although Brazil is one of the most active countries in Latin America's blockchain sphere.  Not So Far From Crypto  Despite the president’s initial ignorance of bitcoin, the growing cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem in Brazil is impossible to ignore.  Bolsonaro's administration itself also showed certain preferences for blockchain. Back in February, the leader appointed an economist involved in blockchain and cryptocurrency to run the Central Bank of Brazil.  Currently, Brazil is one of the biggest cryptocurrency markets in Latin America and has the highest bitcoin trading volume in all the region, reaching nearly 100,000 BTC in April alone.  This is not the first time the Brazilian leader has been connected with blockchain.

42382102,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qanr,1560337938,Bitcoin Struggles for Price Gains As Litecoin Hits 13-Month high,"View  Bitcoin’s price consolidation in a tight range continues for the eighth day, as litecoin rallies to its highest level since May 2018.  BTC’s 4-hour chart shows $8,053 is the level to beat for the bulls. A high-volume break higher could be followed by a rise to $8,500.  LTC looks set to extend its recent rally as per the 3-day chart.  LTC already rallied more than 100 percent in the last six weeks, so a pullback to $120 could be seen before further gains.      Bitcoin (BTC) is lacking a clear directional bias for the eighth consecutive day amid a continued rally in litecoin’s (LTC) price.  The price of a single bitcoin – the world’s leading cryptocurrency market value – has been restricted to a $600 range since June 5. While any drops to $7,500 have been consistently short-lived, buyers have also repeatedly failed to engineer a convincing break above $8,100.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,000 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.5-percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  With BTC so indecisive, major alternative cryptocurrencies like ethereum’s ether token, XRP, bitcoin cash and EOS are also struggling for clear direction.  Litecoin, however, is flashing 6.5 percent gains on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinMarketCap. The fourth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose to $141 on Bitstamp earlier today, the highest level since May 2018.  More notably, at the current price of $136, LTC is up nearly 40 percent from lows below $100 seen just seven days ago. Meanwhile, BTC is up 4 percent on a weekly basis.  With the mining reward halving due on Aug. 8 – a process that could lead to a supply deficit and a resultant upwards pressure on prices – LTC is again leading BTC higher.  BTC 4-hour chart  As seen above, BTC has created a sideways channel inside a falling channel, so a break above $8,063 would confirm two channel breakouts and open the doors to $8,500.  It is worth noting that the breakout could be short-lived if trading volumes continue to remain low.  On the downside, the higher low of $7,713 is the immediate support. A violation there would expose the lower edge of the sideways channel, currently at $7,500.  LTC 3-day chart  Litecoin’s relative strength index is reporting a symmetrical triangle breakout – a bullish continuation pattern.  The 5- and 10-candle averages continue to trend north, indicating a bullish setup.  Further, LTC has consistently seen higher volumes on days of positive price action compared to days of negative price action. Therefore, the path of least resistance looks to be to the higher side.  That said, a pullback to the 5-candle MA support, currently located at $122, could be seen before further gains, as the cryptocurrency has rallied 118 percent in the last 6 weeks and the bulls often take a breather following such stellar rallies.

42382097,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qak5,1560335418,Former US Senator Rick Santorum Supports New Crypto for Catholics,"Former US Senator, neologism, and noted Catholic, Rick Santorum, has come out in support of Cathio, a for-profit organization that will “provide efficient, secure, and transparent movement of funds within the Catholic world.”  From a release:    “Cathio’s platform is designed to enable all sectors of the Catholic economy to benefit from lower costs and transparent payments,” said Cathio CEO Matthew Marcolini.      Former Ambassador to the Holy See and Cathio Advisor Jim Nicholson stated, “The Church is living in a time of great challenges with the laity asking, ‘What can we do?’ Well, Cathio is a lay initiative that not only strives to save the Church money, but positions it to provide greater transparency of financial transactions and the connectivity of people of good will with good works.”    It should be noted that Santorum is the CEO’s father-in-law - a bit of nepotism that can be avoided in the future if Cathio’s board were to take a vow of chastity - and that the board features Cameron Chell, chairman of ICOx Innovations. Chell and his team brought us the exciting and successful KodakCoin.  Details of this product are slim but it looks to be a traditional fintech play with a blockchain chaser. It’s also apparently a ploy to get kids excited about Church.  “Millennials don’t carry cash, they date on apps and watch on-demand entertainment. We have to be there, we have to learn from successful tech companies, and we have to provide a universal solution that makes it easy for younger generations to engage with the Church,” wrote Santorum.  Image via Cathio.  Users of the Cathio network pay 2% to run their financial transactions through the system and lets priests take donations without any of the money passing through the morally bankrupt Silicon Valley payment providers. As an added bonus the app is sort of a Moviefone for churches, allowing them to post photos and mass times on Cathio’s map.  There's one snag, however. Blockchain, Marcolini told the Financial Times, will make it easy for parishioners to know where their donations are going. Sadly, this lack of anonymity goes in direct opposition to Christ’s teachings. You’ll recall He said:  So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.  Maybe they just need to use Monero?

Announced Wednesday, the company has launched a benchmark ranking of over 100 active spot exchanges from across the globe, offering users a ""comprehensive, granular and reliable source of information on the best trading venues.""  CryptoCompare’s Exchange Benchmark was launched to address the need for reliable metrics to evaluate the large number of cryptocurrency exchanges now offering services around the world.  The firm explains:  ""Employing both a qualitative (due diligence) and quantitative (market quality based on order book and trade data) approach, the product does not hinge on aggregate volume data but, rather, uses correlation-of-volume-to-volatility and standard-deviation-of-volume as inputs to CryptoCompare’s 30+ metrics. This is due to existing issues with volume manipulation, wash trading and trading incentives.""  The first analysis, based on exchange data for the period May 1–31, suggests the most trusted three exchanges are Coinbase, Poloniex and Bitstamp in descending order of ranking. BitFlyer, Liquid, itBit, Kraken, Binance, Gemini and Bithumb complete the top 10, again in descending order.  Under the benchmark system, exchanges are graded from high to low – through AA, A, B, C, D, E, F – based on their total cumulative score relative to the pool of exchanges included in the rankings.  The ranking components include: geography, legal and regulatory, investment, team and company, data provision, trade surveillance and market quality. The firm's analysis is based on public information, and its methodology has been explained in a report.  CryptoCompare cites research indicating that many exchanges are wash trading and using incentivised trading schemes to inflate volumes.  The Exchange Benchmark, CryptoCompare says, indicates the problem has been getting worse, with lower quality exchanges (ranked C-F1) increasing market share by 30 percent in the last 12 months.  Charles Hayter, co-founder and CEO of CryptoCompare, said:  “In response to industry concerns over inflated volumes and the lack of reliable metrics for assessing cryptocurrency exchanges, we are excited to launch the CryptoCompare Exchange Benchmark. We look forward to bringing greater transparency to the digital asset class and improving decision-making for market participants by providing a dataset they can trust.”  Bitwise Asset Management also recently published a list of the 10 exchanges that it found are seeing real volume.  It said in a March report that around 95 percent of volume is being faked, and that the real spot market for bitcoin essentially exists on 10 exchanges conducting nearly $300 million in daily trading volume. Its list also includes Coinbase, Bitfinex, Gemini and Binance, as well as Bitfinex and Bittrex, which aren't included in CryptoCompare's top 10.  CryptoCompare said its Exchange Benchmark will be fed into its aggregate indices to create reference rates for the top exchanges.

42382114,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qaRD,1560326422,Inside Monero's 'Last Ditch Effort' to Block Crypto Mining ASICs,"Developers behind the cryptocurrency monero are ramping up efforts to keep specialized mining hardware from dominating its race for rewards.  Of the coins that have a strong privacy focus, monero – launched in 2014 – possesses the largest market capitalization by far with an estimated $1.5 billion valuation. The annual mining rewards generated by the now 5-year-old blockchain total roughly $62 million, according to data site Messari.  But such rewards appear to be increasingly falling into the hands of ASIC operators, nudging out smaller, independent or hobbyist participants. To keep an even playing field, monero developers have conducted regular hard forks to stave off ASICs – but analysis suggests that this approach has proven ineffective as of late and that ASICs are keeping ahead of such efforts.  “ASIC manufacturers can make equipment far faster than we expected,"" said monero contributor Justin Ehrenhofer. ""It takes maybe a month for them to have chips designed and in production so they generally can still make a return on investment even within a six month period.""  Diego Salazar, another monero contributor, told CoinDesk:  “We [also] saw that this was very unsustainable. ... It takes a lot to keep [hard forking] again and again for one. For two, it may decentralize mining but it centralizes in another area. It centralizes on the developers because now there's a lot of trust in developers to keep hard forking.”  As such, monero developers are moving forward with activation of a new mining algorithm known as RandomX, designed to render ASICs non-competitive.  The new code is based off the work of Howard Chu – CTO and founder of computer software firm Symas Corporation – who also developed the database type the monero blockchain presently runs on. Four different audits of the RandomX code are now being completed for an expected code freeze date by July.  As it stands, the algorithm could go live in October.  “We've ultimately come to consensus in general that RandomX is what will be implemented. It's our best shot to preserve monero as it was founded,"" said Ehrenhofer. ""If this fails then monero will probably move to an ASIC-friendly algorithm.""  According to Salazar, RandomX is monero’s “last ditch effort to keep ASIC’s out.”  Putting CPUs at the fore  RandomX according to Chu is designed to be “CPU-centric.”  As opposed to application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), central processing units (CPUs) are a type of computer hardware designed for multi-purpose use.  Calling it a “spectrum of computing power,” Salazar explained:  “On one end, where computers are a jack of all trades are the CPUs... On the other end, computers which does only one thing but extremely well are ASICs.”  CPU’s are the most widely distributed computing resource in the world, according to Chu.  “Practically everyone in the world now has a smart phone in their pocket with a CPU and memory that’s capable of mining RandomX,” highlighted Chu.  With maximum miner decentralization as the goal, Chu predicts that RandomX will preserve an advantageous lead favoring CPU miners over ASICs for at least the next three to five years.  Leaving GPUs behind  At the same time, estimates suggest the RandomX algorithm favors CPU miners over not only ASIC miners but GPU miners as well.  Graphics processing units (GPUs) are optimized for what Chu calls a “graphics workload which tends to be very sequential.”  “Data goes in at the head of the pipeline and you do some munching on it and it all spits out at the end of the pipeline,” Chu said. “The main emphasis there is fast transfers of data from the input to the output, pretty much in a straight line.”  For monero’s current mining algorithm, called CryptoNight, GPU miners take the lead over CPUs in terms of computation and energy efficiency. Originally, however, even CryptoNight was intended to boost CPU performance over other types of hardware.  “It's really again kind of an accident of fate that [CryptoNight] turned out to work fairly well on GPUs. Nobody expected CryptoNight to be good on GPUs and it was anyways,"" explained Chu. ""The fact is today GPUs have so much memory and so much massive memory bandwidth that it's not very much of an obstacle when it comes to CryptoNight, which was designed back in 2013 or so.""  Soon, with the activation of RandomX, Chu predicts CPUs to be “at least three times better than GPUs” at mining on the monero blockchain.  And while this has disgruntled “a very vocal but extremely small minority” of GPU miners, Ehrenhofer maintains that “people with GPUs can always either resell or repurpose their hardware.”  “If I have a monero ASIC, I don't have that same economic option available,” said Ehrenhofer.  As such, despite the impact RandomX will have on not only ASIC miners but also GPU miners on the monero network, Ehrenhofer maintains:  “I'm not concerned about a community split here because RandomX is the closest algorithm that we can pick that retains a vast majority of monero's ideals.”  Lingering concerns  Perhaps a more realistic concern in the mind of Ehrenhofer and others is the proliferation of botnets on the monero network as a result of a CPU-friendly mining algorithm like RandomX.  ""The basic concern is there's millions or hundreds of millions of computers that are out there that are poorly secured,” explained Chu. “It's very easy for malware to invade these computers and take them over to do whatever a particular network operator wants to do.”  Such botnets, infected by malware, have always been somewhat of an issue on monero, according to Ehrenhofer.  “Monero is by far the most illicitly mined cryptocurrency at the moment and it has been for several years,” Ehrenhofer said. “RandomX does not prevent people from crypto-jacking and other nefarious versions of malware.”  Indeed, given that monero's present mining algorithm – CryptoNight – has always favored CPU and GPU mining, Ehrenhofer notes that there are resources in place on the monero website and other related forums to help users who's devices are impacted.  New partnerships  Even still, efforts to bootstrap RandomX have seen support from those outside of the community, particularly by other crypto projects that might make use of CPU-friendly mining algorithm.  Arweave, which raised a reported $8.7 million in an initial coin offering (ICO), is testing RandomX.  ""An ASIC-resistant proof-of-work algorithm like RandomX will further enhance our permanent, low-cost, tamper-resistant storage network,"" said Sam Williams, founder and CEO at Arweave, in a press release from earlier this month. ""RandomX helps us ensure that power over the decentralized content policies in the Arweave network remains well distributed across many globally distributed parties.""  To this, Arweave has funded one of the four audits over the RandomX code.  Completed officially on Friday, the audit was estimated in public documents to cost roughly $80,000. CEO and co-founder Dan Guido later affirmed to CoinDesk the final cost for Arweave was actually $28,000.  Speaking to CoinDesk in an interview, Williams explained:  ""It was one of our hopes going into the audit process that by helping to fund it we could do a small public service by making sure other [crypto] projects can see there is a programmatic proof-of-work algorithm that is likely ASIC-resistant in practice without fear of security.""  The other three audits totaling $130,000 that are still to be finalized by security firms Kudelski Security, X41 D-Sec, and QuarksLab were funded through crowd-sourced donations from the monero community. They are expected to wrap up by July, according to Chu.  The next step after that is an eventual launch of the algorithm on a public monero test network before a tentatively scheduled mainnet activation this October.  Risky business  For all the discussion that has gone into preparing RandomX for a mainnet implementation, Ehrenhofer maintains that the true benefits of RandomX won’t be certain until it's live on the network.  “We don't know if RandomX will work yet even if all the audits come back and they say your cryptography is pretty good. We don't know in practice how things will actually turnout,"" warned Ehrenhofer.  But the worst-case scenario in Ehrenhofer's mind if the algorithm proves to be unsuccessful is a switch to an ASIC-friendly mining algorithm similar to the one currently utilized by bitcoin.  “I think if RandomX does fail and monero switches to something more ASIC-friendly, many in the bitcoin community will tell us, 'I told you so.'"" Ehrenhofer joked.  Even so, Salazar maintains that monero should have the runway to try new things and fail at them.  ""Isn't the idea to see what's going to work best so that one day we can have a good digital, private, fungible cryptocurrency?"" Salazar asked. ""If monero is not but a stepping stone to get to that good currency then by all means let monero be the lost leader.""  Salazar concluded:  ""The monero people are nothing if not resilient nerds that decide to take on the man. So we said, 'You know what? Let's give this a go, one last ditch effort.'""

Established in 2017, founders Fabio Canesin, Fabian Wahle, Ethan Fast, Thomas Saunders, and Luciano Engel built Nash as an integrated financial services platform in which users could invest, trade, and make payments with digital assets. All five founders of Nash were also behind the City of Zion open-source community and continue to develop key infrastructure for the NEO blockchain.  The company raised $12.25 million from traditional VCs and $25 million from a registered public digital security offering in Liechtenstein. The company claims this is the first offering of its type in Europe. They have opened their platform to alpha testers although, for security reasons, they are being choosy about who and when they let users in.  Unlike centralized asset exchanges that use a mediating third party to facilitate trade between buyers and sellers, Nash is a decentralized exchange. They offer self-custody solutions through their beta exchange and app and their current browser extension has been installed over 50,000 timeshttps://nash.io/products/extension. The extension allows you to pay sites that support Nash’s own NashPay protocol or dApps. It also acts as an identity management system.  “Nash provides a global web based and mobile platform that allows users to easily trade, pay and invest on digital assets and currencies without having to master blockchain terminology while keeping the security and economic properties of the assets via self-custody solutions,” said Canesin.  Another key feature of Nash is its funds management solutions that uses advanced cryptography to solve several usability problems with self-custody. Such system allows users to trade, pay, and invest on digital assets and currencies without having to master the intricacies of blockchain. Like most startups in the space, it's now up to Nash to build a brand and a user base for its nascent technologies.

42411659,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glYhtK,1560312013,"Initial Exchange Offerings Are Providing Big Returns, But Why?","Christopher Brookins is the founder of Valiendero Digital Assets, a quantitative crypto fund founded out of Carnegie Mellon.     2019 has not only seen a resurgence of the crypto bull, but also capital raising.  In particular, IEOs or “initial exchange offerings” have been highly visible for both good and bad reasons. Positively, IEOs have produced large returns to-date. Negatively, to quote Jeff Dorman at Arca, “Many argue (correctly) that IEOs are illegal (in the US) since the tokens are clearly securities, & unregulated exchanges are acting as broker/dealers. Thus, U.S. investors can't participate.”  However, despite legality issues for US investors, many global participants are still actively investing in these offerings due to their return potential.  So, what is driving prices?  Driving Forces  New and small-cap (less than $100 million in market cap) digital assets are highly reflexive and driven by two key variables, exchange volume (ExVol) and market cap (MCAP). The logic being that the greater the buying volume in relation to the asset's overall market cap, the greater the potency of its reflexivity cycle (see below).  The aforementioned speculative demand can be quantified by the ratio of ExVol to MCAP, which may offer investors a better tool to gauge risk and reward in these speculative assets.  Quantitative Analysis  The chart below displays the correlation of the speculative demand ratio (ExVol to MCAP) in the price of several IEOs. The chart is broken down into distinct time periods, which shows the efficacy of the ratio as the asset matures, e.g. first 60 days, first 180 days, first 360 days, and historical (since inception).  Please note, reliable MCAP data for newer IEOs like MATIC, FET, and CELR does not span 60 days, thus only historical is calculated.  This time, the chart below displays the correlation of the speculative demand ratio (ExVol to MCAP) to in price of several small-cap assets as a way to generalize the ratio to all new issuances, not just IEOs in 2019.  Conclusion  As the aforementioned charts illustrate, the speculative demand ratio is a highly valuable signal for investors looking at IEOs or new digital assets, especially during the first 180 days of existence.  Post-180 days, the ratio is still useful for price prediction, but its signal diminishes. Presumably, as an asset matures, fundamentals influence price more, e.g. bitcoin's historical correlation to in price is only 0.02.  However, for newer IEOs like MATIC, CELR, and FET, the correlation of the speculative demand ratio is likely to rise over the coming months. Thus, current or potential investors should closely monitor the ratio’s trend as a directional gauge of risk and reward.

According to a report from CNBC on Wednesday, the Coinbase Card is now available for users in Spain, Germany, France, Italy, Ireland, and the Netherlands.  With the card, customers will be able to spend their cryptocurrency assets including bitcoin, ethereum, and litecoin in both online and physical stores that accept Visa.  Coinbase first rolled out a cryptocurrency Visa debit card in April, exclusively for users based in the U.K. at the time.  Zeeshan Feroz, CEO of Coinbase U.K., did not disclose how many users the firm had signed up since April but said in an interview with CNBC that it had ""blew past"" the initial 1,000 cards issued to customers for free.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, Coinbase Cards are linked to a mobile app available on both Android and iOS devices, in which customers can select which type of cryptocurrency they would like to use to fund each spending.  That said, customers are not directly paying merchants with crypto assets. Instead, Coinbase charges a fee to help convert users' cryptocurrencies into a fiat currency, i.e. euro in the new offering.  The firm partners with PaySafe, a U.K. payment processor, to issue the cards, a Coinbase spokesperson told CoinDesk before.
