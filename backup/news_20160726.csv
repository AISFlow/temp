Announced today, Coinbase will allow users to buy bitcoin and ether with credit and debit cards. Notably, users will not be able to sell digital currency.  Coinbase product manager Ankur Nandwani said that the company was keen to start with extending its buying service to Australia as a means to increase the size of its network, but that it hopes to add a sell function at a later date.  Nandwani told CoinDesk:  ""In the new countries, each country has its own way to enter the market.""  With the news, Coinbase brings its exchange service to a market with relatively little access to trading pairs for the country's currency, the Australian dollar.  According to data from Bitcoin Charts, Australian dollar trading is only available on two exchanges, both of which have less than 2,000 BTC in volumes.  Nandwani, however, said Coinbase believes its investment in Australia could prove valuable.  ""Even though it might be small, we do think in the future it will be a big market,"" he said.

42399172,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiZok,1469559093,Ethereum Creator Vitalik Buterin Addresses 'Classic' Blockchain,"Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin issued new statements today reiterating that the Ethereum Foundation, the non-profit founded to support development work on the ethereum protocol, will support the version of the ethereum blockchain that includes a hard fork meant to enable investors to recover funds lost in the collapse of The DAO.  Founded in June 2014, the Swiss organization (formally called Stiftung Ethereum) has been largely quiet over the last month as the community sought to move forward from the collapse of The DAO, which for a brief time was the platform’s most prominent project, holding at one time $160m in investor capital denominated in ether, ethereum's cryptocurrency.  Most immediately, the statements quell uncertainty about whether the Ethereum Foundation would support both the primary ethereum blockchain, as well as Ethereum Classic, a version being maintained with the original transaction history.  Overall, the organization has elected to stand by the informal community voting that lead to the hard fork, executed roughly one week ago, while indicating it would not seek to hinder progress on any alternative ethereum projects, such as Ethereum Classic.  Buterin wrote:  ""We recognize that the ethereum code can be used to instantiate other blockchains with the same consensus rules, including testnets, consortium and private chains, clones and spin-offs, and have never been opposed to such instantiations.""  Buterin used the remainder of the announcement to discuss how technical users could ensure clients were formatted for use with their desired version of the ethereum blockchain.  Further, Buterin encouraged the Ethereum Classic team to execute an additional hard fork that would guard its blockchain from ‘replay attacks’ by moving classic ethers, or the currency units on the alternative blockchain, to new accounts.  At press time, reaction to the post was mixed, with users largely split over ideological lines that mirrored the larger debate across the ecosystem in recent days.  For example, on reddit, some praised the new clarity from the foundation. Others, by contrast, sought to reiterate support for Ethereum Classic as an implementation of the protocol that best represents the values of the ethereum project as a whole.

42399164,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiZiq,1469550166,Genesis Trading Sees Interest in Classic Ether Market,"A prominent digital currency trading service reports that investors are expressing an interest in buying into the version of the ethereum blockchain that rejected last week's hard fork.  Over-the-counter digital currency trading service Genesis Global Trading is now trading classic ethers (ETC), but reports its volume at less than $100,000 in purchases thus far. Serving institutions and individuals, Genesis sells blocks of the digital currency, as well as alternatives such as bitcoin, with a minimum order size of $25,000.  Despite a small number of initial buyers, CEO Michael Moro said he is confident that demand could begin to rise for the nascent digital currency, which has been winning over users as a protest tool and, in recent days, building a budding market.  Moro told CoinDesk:  ""We started to explore ETC over the weekend based on some inquiries we received. People were looking for a place to buy and sell ETC, and Genesis was happy to provide a market.""  Moro went on to characterize institutional interest in ether as ""minimal"", while cautioning that it's too early to draw comparisons between the two digital currencies at this stage.  The news comes amid an increase in the price of classic ethers, which has risen more than 250% in the last 24 hours. The price of ether, by comparison, has fallen roughly 5% in that time.  At press time, the price of 1 ETC was trading for 0.0028 BTC (or roughly $1.80), up from $0.50 yesterday.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which owns Genesis Trading.

42426964,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyDlh,1469545840,Visa Europe Partners for Bitcoin Micropayments Trial,"Bitcoin micropayments startup SatoshiPay is developing a new proof-of-concept with Visa Europe's innovation unit.  Work on the project was first disclosed earlier this year, when Visa Europe Collab said that it was exploring bitcoin micropayments for connected devices. At the time, the company indicated it was looking at use cases like smart light bulbs that could pay for their own electricity.  The concept, according to SatoshiPay founder Meinhard Benn, involves the integration of the startup’s technology with Visa’s card payments structure, allowing for automated micropayments from a person’s Visa account to a SatoshiPay wallet.  Benn said that the proof-of-concept seeks to ""establish a safer method of purchasing small amounts of bitcoin using credit and debit cards"".  He told CoinDesk:  ""During the PoC, we will establish a safer method of purchasing small amounts of bitcoin using credit and debit cards. With a process for fiat payments in place, we will also integrate other payment local methods like direct debit or instant bank transfers.""  Benn said Visa plans to work with the firm to explore how its technology could be used for machine-to-machine payments and IoT devices. Other plans include a future user study conducted in conjunction with Visa Europe Collab on micropayments for web content.  The project isn't Visa Europe Collab’s foray into bitcoin. Last year, the company unveiled a remittance app concept developed in partnership with Epiphyte.  Visa Europe was not immediately available for comment when reached.

42426965,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyDnh,1469505417,Has Ethereum's Hard Fork Created a New Kind of Double Spend?,"Matthew Spoke is the founder of blockchain startup Nuco and a former consultant at Deloitte Canada.  In this opinion piece, Spoke (with the help of his CTO Jin Tu) discusses the developing ramifications of the ethereum community's decision to change its consensus code, arguing its unintended consequences illustrate the shortcomings of public blockchain networks.  Try explaining what a blockchain is to a layman. Not a simple task.  Now consider how difficult it can be to explain ethereum, The DAO, the DAO attack and now the ETH/ETC divide that is surfacing within the community.  To explain the concept of a blockchain, I often focus heavily on the concept of immutability – the idea that any piece of history recorded on a well-distributed blockchain is in essence irreversible, or permanently engraved in time. But if that’s true, how can one explain the ethereum hard fork debate?  I tend to agree with a recent CoinDesk piece that argued the hard fork should be seen as a ""rite of passage"" for a technology still very much in the process of maturing (although while heavily under public scrutiny). But, that said, whether deserved or not, it seems like the public holds ethereum to a higher standard. (In part, this may be because of the increasing number of companies around the world leveraging the technology in labs, and buying into the rhetoric that ethereum might be the biggest game-changer since the Internet).  With that in mind, I think it's worth highlighting some of the important risks and lessons facing the ethereum community, the companies leveraging it and those invested in its success.  Essentially, last week’s hard fork has had an unexpected consequence: the creation of two parallel ethereum chains; ETH (the version of ethereum that accepted the hard fork) and ETC (the version of ethereum that has rejected it – ""Ethereum Classic"").  Because of philosophical disagreements in the community, a certain number of miners have opted to continue supporting the unforked chain (ETC). This is contrary to the basic concept in blockchains that the longest chain is the authoritative history.  In this case, ETC, with less hashrate, has created an alternate truth.  This is where the new ""double spend"" problems occurs. If you held ether before the hard fork, (block 1,920,000), you now have tokens represented on both chains (ETH and ETC), each of which now has its own trading value, but the same genesis block.  As of the writing of this opinion piece, ETC is trading at approximately 5% of the value of ETH.  Now, why is this a problem?  Our CTO, Jin Tu, uses the following scenarios to illustrate why this might be cause for concern:  Sell ETC and keep their ETH – Without touching their ETH balance, owners can cash out in ETC on exchanges like Poloniex that are accepting the alternative fork's currency. This is essentially an opportunity for a simple 5% gain.  Sell ETC and buy more ETH – Owners can convert their ETC into additional ETH, thereby increasing their balance without requiring new capital, and without mining. Again, this allows owners to increase their holdings in ETH by 5%: a quick gain.  Sell ETC and sell ETH – If owners sell on both chains, they can earn an additional 5% and completely eliminate any risk of exposure on either ethereum network.  Sell ETH and keep their ETC – Owners can cash out of ETH to pull their exposure out of Ethereum, but still maintain a balance of 5% on ETC.  Sell ETH and buy more ETC – In this most extreme scenario, owners can convert all their ETH to ETC and increase their balance by 2,000% (eg if $10 = 1 ETH, then $10 = 20 ETC). If enough owners do this, and the majority balance of activity reverts back to ETC, then so too might the miners.  Reading this, you might see these scenarios as proof of an inherent flaw, or maybe as a new form of arbitrage opportunity.  But either way, it’s clear that this amount of confusion and uncertainty would be problematic if The DAO were some form of enterprise application (maybe for trading public equities), and the resulting fork led to this split.  Time may resolve the current issues, or at least bring clarity to the confusion. But in the meantime, our stance is that it's important that all involved understand the implications and tradeoffs.  While the community has a way to sort out its issues, we believe that the last few days have reinforced the argument for well-defined, use case-specific, enterprise blockchain networks.  We feel it important to note that Nuco remains vested in and committed to ethereum. We continue to have enormous confidence in the promise of this technology and specifically, the concept of ""smart blockchains"" and the potential it unlocks.  Our genuine commitment to the project is the exact motivation for this piece – we wish to be responsible in the development, use and implementation of blockchain networks and applications.
