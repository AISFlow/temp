42426389,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJN6Nh,1433945705,"Taiwanese Company Brings Bitcoin to 10,000 Convenience Stores","Taiwanese startup Maicoin has launched a system that lets users buy bitcoin at 10,000 convenience stores in the territory, both over the counter and at in-store terminals.  Maicoin  founder and CEO Alex Liu said foreign workers using bitcoin for remittances would benefit from the over-the-counter service, as it does not require users to have a bank account.  In Asia, people routinely pay utility and postal bills at convenience stores by giving physical cash to store clerks who initiate electronic transfers.  To use the service, customers create an order for bitcoins using Maicoin's mobile app or web-based wallet, then simply hand cash to the shopkeeper to complete the transaction. They can also do the same via regular bank ATMs from their personal bank accounts, with a direct fund transfer.  Convenience store options  In January, BitoEX, Maicoin's competitor, launched bitcoin purchasing at thousands of Taiwan's FamilyMart, OK mart and Hi-Life stores, adding the country's largest chain, 7-11 last month. The service uses a cellphone number and PIN combination system to transfer bitcoins directly to users' wallets.  With MaiWallet, users set up a bitcoin purchase on their phone or tablet, which displays a barcode for a convenience store cashier to scan. Customers not using MaiWallet can still use the service, but will need to use the web interface to generate a code to enter at the convenience store.  The mobile app is currently available as a closed beta, though anyone can contact the company to request an invite. The company says it is looking at an official release for MaiWallet in late summer or early autumn.  Account top-ups with physical ATMs are limited to NT$500,000 ($16,200) per day to please AML regulators. Using Taiwan's 'eATM' system with home-based card readers, users are limited to NT$30,000 ($972) a day.  Within those limits, determined after consultation with local authorities, there is no need for Maicoin customers to provide any ID to use the service.  The system is purchase-only at this stage, and does not allow users to sell bitcoins in return for cash.  Consumer-oriented exchange  In operation for just over a year, Maicoin's bitcoin exchange services are aimed at the consumer, merchant and remittance markets, rather than professional traders.  It has raised $2m in venture funding over two rounds, and has over 30,000 registered users. Liu said the company has processed over $4m in consumer and remittance transactions in the past year, though this could not be confirmed.  Maicoin's only hiccup came in February with the collapse of alleged bitcoin-based investment scam 'MyCoin' in Hong Kong. The names, identical when spoken aloud, may still cause confusion but Liu said it has not adversely affected Maicoin's business to date.  Taiwan's consumer market shows great promise for bitcoin, especially through social media like Facebook, which Liu describes as ""huge"" in the territory.  Maicoin has just launched integration with Facebook Shopping Cart, allowing smaller Taiwanese online merchants to accept bitcoin. The company is also actively reaching out to local hotels, pubs and other bars to begin accepting bitcoin.  Remittance partnerships  Maicoin has also partnered with Philippines exchange and remittance service Coins.ph to serve the large number of Filipino expat workers in Taiwan.  Using Maicoin and Coins.ph apps, over 78,000 foreign workers in Taiwan can send money to their home countries any time and in any amount, without incurring extra fees.  This could provide an advantage for workers who only get one day a week off (Sunday) and often spend that day at remittance brokers' branches transferring their money.  Liu said the biggest hurdle in getting regulatory approval for Maicoin's system was its handling of local currency, not bitcoin.  ""The conversation here is no longer about the legality of buying and selling bitcoin. It's about being a full payment processor. That's a huge step forward from last year.""  A recent hackathon at National Taiwan University (NTU ) called 'Bitcoin and Big Data' attracted over 300 students keen to explore the new field, he said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/06/10/taiwanese-company-brings-bitcoin-to-10000-convenience-stores,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4e48f2a6e6052ca16debcba3ac872dcfe9aeaaf1-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426378,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJN5th,1433937733,Mexican Bitcoin Exchange Bitso Acquires Competitor,"Mexican bitcoin exchange Bitso has acquired competitor Unisend Mexico in an attempt to consolidate its market share in the region.  A relatively small exchange, Bitso's trading volume in the last 24 hours stood at approximately $7,671 (33.4 BTC) – less than 1% of US exchange Coinbase, which had reached $1.34m at the time of press.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Pablo González, CEO at Bitso, said:  ""Although we feel strongly that the market is on the verge of significant growth, right now it doesn't really make sense to have such a diffused effort. Consolidation makes sense at this point, in preparation for the huge potential that we see coming with remittance partners poised to begin activity over the bitcoin rail.""  Bitso, which acquired Unisend Mexico for an undisclosed amount, will be taking on Jose Rodriguez, its former CEO, as vice president of payments.  Commenting on the acquisition, Rodriguez was confident the new team would accelerate growth and surpass competitors Volabit and Mexbthttps://mexbt.com/en/ to become the leading bitcoin exchange in the country.  Fomer Unisend customers will be migrated to Bitso, according to the pair.  Boom and bust  As previously reported by CoinDesk, Bitso launched an e-commerce platform and point-of-sale (POS) system, BitsoPagos in January this year.  Gonzalez, who said the bitcoin market is set to ""boom"", seemed positive about the digital currency's future, noting how it could help Mexico's remittance market and cross-border payments.  The merger follows the closure of various bitcoin exchanges including Canada's CARVITEX – later acquired by New York platform Coinsetter in April – and Vault of Satoshi.  Elsewhere, BTCXIndia shut down operations in May.  Disclaimer: CoinDesk founder Shakil Khan is an investor in BitPay.

42426391,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJN6Rh,1433935393,New CoinDesk Report Reveals Who Really Uses Bitcoin,"Young, pale, techie and male. Anecdotally, this has been the make up of bitcoin's core community since the cryptocurrency began, at least if media reports and Internet chatter are to be believed.  But in 2015, is this still an accurate reflection of its user base worldwide? In our latest research report – Who Really Uses Bitcoin? – we put this theory to the test.  Analysing nearly 4,000 responses received in our multilingual survey, likely the largest in bitcoin's history, the 45-page report provides an in-depth look at who is using bitcoin, who isn't and why that matters.  But more than that, this report attempts to identify ways in which the community that uses the cryptocurrency can expand its reach, moving beyond the current demographic to new groups, with different cultures, economic status and needs.  Highlights include:  A complete profile of the average bitcoin user by age, gender, location and background.  Detailed consumer spending data – how are people acquiring and using their bitcoin?  Tips for companies expanding bitcoin's technology to emerging markets and underrepresented groups.  Expert insight on bitcoin's ""branding problem"" and why improving accessibility is critical.  At a glance  By and large, the survey's responses paint a picture faithful to the young, white, tech-savvy men that have become the 'poster boys' of bitcoin.  Of the 3,515 respondents who told us they owned bitcoin, almost 60% were under 35 years old.  Despite a growing number of initiatives such as Bitcoin Women's Day, women using bitcoin are still a minority, with over 90% of bitcoin users in our survey identifying as male. Though this figure is a minuscule improvement (5.2%) from the male majority seen in previous surveys.  With regards to race, 65.8% of respondents in the survey identified as 'White'. Second came 'Asian'.  While these figures reinforce the young, white, male stereotype, other findings – such as average income – are more surprising. The question of average earnings providing a very even split across all earning brackets. Those earning $50,000–$100,000 came top, at 23.9%. One in five said their household income was below $25,000.  While many are tech-savvy, the notion of bitcoin users being 'early adopters' of technology also stumbled into trouble. Three quarters of respondents said they got into bitcoin after May 2013, and one third began using bitcoin in the last year.  This data, like any, has its limitations. The four web surveys – offered in Chinese, Japanese, Spanish and English – were propagated across various local interest groups, but were predominantly accessed via CoinDesk's main site and social media platforms.  For this reason, responses are largely linked to our North American and European readership and do not necessarily reflect the profile of bitcoin users outside these regions. For example, our Chinese language survey received comparatively few responses, though there are known to be many cryptocurrency users in the region.  We have not weighted the results to compensate for this imbalance, but present the findings of the survey as-is.  In terms of the location of respondents, 49.85% were based in North America, followed by 32.99% in Europe and 9.36% in Asia.
