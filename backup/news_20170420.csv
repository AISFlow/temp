42427472,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVfJh,1492721149,Spreads Widen at Bitcoin Exchanges Amid Bitfinex Banking Issues,"Bitfinex's banking issues appear to be affecting the wider bitcoin exchange markets.  As fiat withdrawal problems at the world's largest US dollar bitcoin exchange continued today, the spread between bitcoin prices observed on Bitfinex and other international exchanges surged, rising to more than $90, or roughly 7%, in some cases.  At approximately 17:15 UTC, for example, bitcoin traded at $1,325 on Bitfinex, roughly $92 (or 7% higher) than the price of $1,233 observed on itBit, according to data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  The spread was similar on Bitstamp and CoinBase's GDAX exchange – where the digital currency traded at an $85 spread at that time. The difference was smaller when observed on OKCoin, though OKCoin has also reported banking issues in recent days.  These figures were sharply higher than the start of the session, when bitcoin was trading at $1,265 on Bitfinex, approximately $50 higher than the price on both itBit and GDAX, according to data from the CoinDesk BPI.  At press time, these price gaps continued to be outsized with a $60 spread observed between Bitstamp and GDAX and Bitfinex.  Wire transfer difficulties  The development follows Bitfinex's announcement today that it is unable to send wire transfers overseas due to challenges with its correspondent banks. At first, Bitfinex claimed it was informed by these financial institutions that the exchange lacked the ability to process transfers involving Hong Kong dollars and Swiss francs.  While the exchange said it was able to make some transfers involving these fiat currencies, the financial institutions later informed Bitfinex it would no longer be able to make transfers using these currencies.  These difficulties come days after Bitfinex announced on 13th April that its USD withdrawals were suffering delays. On 17th April, it further said its Taiwan-based banking providers were refusing incoming wire transfers.  At the time, the exchange emphasized that it was working on ""alternative solutions"" that would allow its customers to make deposits and withdrawals using fiat currencies.  Uncertain context  Still, while this has stoked worries about a Mt Gox-style insolvency, the exchange vehemently denied these allegations today.  It's worth noting, too, that Bitfinex has a history of bouncing back from issues as well, as it recently finished paying back users for a $65m hack experienced early last August.  While it remains to be seen how the situation will unfold, with BTC-e and OKCoin joining Bitfinex in announcing banking issues, the developments have sparked some fears of wider crackdowns on exchanges.  BTC-e representatives told CoinDesk its issue had to do with a third-party payment service, Mayzus, one it reported happens multiple times a year.  As such, it's possible the uptick in issues is merely reflective of the tough environment bitcoin businesses have always faced when seeking to secure banking partnerships.

42427463,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVf3h,1492711451,Bitcoin MSB Exemption Goes to New Hampshire Governor for Approval,"Senators in New Hampshire have passed a bill that would exempt digital currency traders from money transmission regulations, advancing the measure to the state's governor for signature.  HB436, first filed in mid-January, aims to create an exception from money transmission requirements for ""persons conducting business using transactions conducted in whole or in part in virtual currency"".  The proposal drew both supporters and critics – grassroots advocates on one side, state officials like New Hampshire’s chief banking regulator on the other – and in a vote early last month, the state House of Representatives passed the measure and sent to the Senate.  When reached, Senate representative told CoinDesk the bill earlier today passed by a 13-10 vote, and it now goes to Governor Chris Sununu for signature.  Public records  show that the Senate’s Commerce Committee – which considered the bill before advancing it to the full chamber – gave their nod of approval despite pleas from officials in the state to either amend or reject the bill outright.  During a hearing earlier this month, representatives from both the New Hampshire Banking Department and Department of Justice argued against the bill. Their testimony was in sharp contrast with both grassroots supporters and the bill’s sponsors in the House, who argued that the exemption would benefit the state in the long run.  New Hampshire’s push toward digital currency regulation is unique among efforts in other US states, which have largely seen legislative actions that lean toward more scrutiny of digital currency activities.

42427458,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVeth,1492707120,Wire Transfer Problems Worsen for Digital Currency Exchange Bitfinex,"Digital currency exchange Bitfinex can't send wire transfers abroad due to its ongoing banking issues, representatives said today.  Responding to users on Reddit, a rep for the firm said that despite initial signs to the contrary, outbound wire transfers are unavailable in Swiss francs and Hong Kong dollars. Bitfinex later released a formal statement on the matter.  Initially, the rep said, wire transfers denominated in CHF and HKD were going out – but then ""the vast majority of these wires were rejected over the course of the last week"".  Bitfinex went on to say:  ""We were advised by our banks that we would be able to process outbound wires in HKD and CHF, and while we were able to successfully process several such transactions, we are now being told that the moratorium is being extended to these currencies, as well. Domestic transfers in all currencies within Taiwan, however, are working with no problems or delays.""  The exchange said that in spite of the wire outage, withdrawals and deposits denominated in digital currencies are still working, as well as domestic transfers.  The disclosure marks the latest wrinkle in Bitfinex’s ongoing banking dispute, which surfaced earlier this month. During the first week of April, the exchange said it was unable to process outbound wire transfers in US dollars due to issues with Wells Fargo, which previously acted as a correspondent bank for the financial institutions Bitfinex works with in Taiwan.  Earlier this week, Bitfinex announced that it would not longer be able to accept inbound wire transfers due to the banking dispute.

42427453,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVenh,1492699836,Malta's Government is Developing a National Blockchain Strategy,"Malta’s government is reportedly on the cusp of embracing blockchain through the adoption of a national strategy focused on the tech.  Malta Today reports that Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, during a speech this week, said that Malta’s Cabinet had approved the first draft of a “national strategy to promote blockchain”, though what the particulars of that policy may be remains to be seen. Muscat, the paper said, is planning to release the strategy for public comment in the near future.  He did, however, suggest that Malta might look to apply the tech to its land registry process – a concept other governments have begun embracing. Muscat also indicated that Malta’s health industry may also utilize blockchain.  The prime minister went on to say:  ""This is not just about bitcoin, and I also look forward to seeing blockchain technology implemented in the Lands Registry and the national health registries. Malta can be a global trail-blazer in this regard.""  A strong endorsement from Malta wouldn’t be that surprising, given past comments from Muscat himself. In late February, when addressing a conference in Brussels, Muscat called on EU leaders to embrace cryptocurrencies and support accommodative regulatory approaches to the tech.  According to Malta Today, Muscat returned to that point during his speech, saying that the EU shouldn’t shy away from taking an early – and positive – stance on cryptocurrencies.  ""We must be on the frontline in embracing this crucial innovation, and we cannot just wait for others to take action and copy them,"" said Muscat. ""We must be the ones that others copy.""

42427468,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVfDh,1492695009,US Government Watchdog: 'Unclear' If New DLT Rules Needed,"The US Government Accountability Office (GAO) has yet to decide if new regulations are needed to capture blockchain tech.  The agency, which provides investigative and auditing services to the US Congress, published a broad, multi-chapter report today on the state of fintech today. Included is a section on blockchain that explores details the technology itself while providing an overview of industry developments in recent months.  The release comes months after the GAO audited the digital currency policies of the Internal Revenue Service last year, releasing a report that warned the agency had left consumers at risk of perhaps unintentionally failing to meet their tax obligations due to its existing policies.  While the new report isn't so focused on one particular area of policy, it does echo a refrain among governments worldwide: that it's not certain if blockchain requires a new kind of regulatory framework.  The report notes:  ""Continued development of DLT is needed to understand how DLT and its components will be regulated by the existing legal and regulatory system. Additionally, it is unclear whether new regulation will need to be created because DLT can present new and unique challenges.""  In January  , for example, the EU's top securities watchdog issued a similar statement, noting that, after more than a year of fact-finding and soliciting of public comments, its officials concluded that new regulations would be premature.

42427466,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVf9h,1492689603,Litecoin's Emerging Scaling Debate Explained,"If you're wondering why litecoin is attracting new attention of late, you might not be alone.  The often-overlooked alternative cryptocurrency is in the midst of a historically uncharacteristic price spike and a vicious bout of technical drama that is rivaling bitcoin's own scaling debate.  In fact, litecoin's new developments are perhaps best viewed as simply the latest extension of bitcoin's two-year scaling debate, since the controversy also revolves around a proposed blockchain upgrade called Segregated Witness.  The long-in-progress code change, supporters say, could usher in a wave of changes that could improve bitcoin's usability. But, some miners and users in the community are opposed to the change on technical and political grounds – a fact that, months after the code's release, has effectively stalled adoption.  However, while bitcoin is struggling to secure the needed levels of support from miners for the upgrade to go through, litecoin has almost reached the necessary threshold.  Some say that making the change on litecoin will help to signal whether it's a safe and beneficial technical change, or not. Thus, it's beginning to look almost like a testbed for bitcoin. Others argue it could be a way for litecoin to become a novel network, one with a distinct value proposition in its own right.  Still, it's been a bumpy road. One minute the community thinks SegWit is about to activate, the next it doesn’t seem so clear. In this way, the story could soon take another turn soon.  But first, let's start with the basics.  A quick history  Litecoin, a cryptocurrency branded as 'the silver to bitcoin’s gold', first emerged in 2011. At a technical level, it's nearly identical to bitcoin, except for a shorter block time, a different hashing algorithm and a few other changes originally designed with merchants in mind.  In January, litecoin released a new version featuring code for SegWit and an activation threshold of 75% of miner signaling (rather than the 95% required for activation on the bitcoin network).  ""[W]ith SegWit and bitcoin’s current block scaling deadlock, I see a potential for litecoin to help bitcoin break through this deadlock,"" said litecoin creator Charlie Lee in a blog post.  Further, hashrate support for the change has, for the most part, been on the rise over the last couple of months, prompting buzz and renewed interest in the altcoin.  Why hasn't SegWit activated yet?  Because SegWit tweaks consensus rules, changing how nodes validate blocks, it needs a supermajority of miner support to activate quickly and safely.  On litecoin, if 75% of blocks feature a snippet of code indicating support for the change within a two-week period (known as a 'retarget period'), then the change locks in. The market has been reacting as its inched toward that mark.  This week, when support crossed 75%, many users speculated that the change would activate, but, a couple of mining pools multiplied their hashpower, bringing down support for the period to roughly 70%.  This has prompted some further discussion about whether the ability of miners to veto code changes is good or bad for public blockchains.  What's next?  Some  litecoin users have been calling for a user-activated soft fork, where the cryptocurrency's so-called economy paves the way for an upgrade, rather than mining pools.  In a nutshell, 'user-activated soft forks' (UASFs) are one of a few ways of pushing through consensus rule changes – rules that all nodes need to agree on unless they want to be left on an alternative blockchain. It's contentious because it could cause a network split. Another downside is that they take more time to prepare for.  Despite all the recent hype, though, it’s hard to say if SegWit will ever activate on litecoin, even if it’s close to doing so.  Nonetheless, some users and developers are making plans in case it does.  Bitcoin Core developer Johnson Lau said that, should SegWit activate on litecoin, he will shift some of his efforts there to work on MAST, a project that could expand the cryptocurrency's smart contract capabilities.  Lee also noted that a version of Lightning Network is also in the works, suggesting innovation could migrate to litecoin should it activate the change.

42427473,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVfHh,1492686008,Is $40 the New Floor for Ethereum's Ether Tokens?,"Ether prices have been hovering above $40 per coin as of late, indicating significant support for that price, according to several analysts.  Since 22nd March, ether, the cryptocurrency powering the decentralized application platform ethereum, has traded above this particular level.  During this time, ether has risen past $50 more than once, reaching as much as $53.78 on 29th March, according to CoinMarketCap. So far this year, the cryptocurrency has increased in value fivefold – from roughly $10 to $50.  Amid this continued strength, Joe Lee, founder and CEO of bitcoin derivatives platform Magnr, told CoinDesk that $40 appears to be a price ethereum users are happy with.  Charles Hayter, founder and CEO of data service provider CryptoCompare, offered a similar sentiment, telling CoinDesk he believes there's enough evidence now to deem it a ""solid support level"".  Broad rally  The price of ether has been rising at a time when alternative assets have also been experiencing inflows. While bitcoin has drawn interest from traders for years, many have been diversifying by seeking out alternative cryptocurrencies investments.  In the last month, the total value of all cryptocurrencies has climbed more than 30% from $22.6bn to $29.5bn, according to CoinMarketCap. The market cap of bitcoin, in contrast, has increased roughly 20% from $16.3bn to $19.6bn.  Magnr's Lee believes ether's market cap has benefited from this overall movement.  ""This is a sign of new money flowing into the space and a clear indicator that the new money is not staying in bitcoin, but heading straight for alternatives such as ethereum,"" he said.  Ryan Rabaglia, head trader for Octagon Strategy, which recently began making OTC trades for ether, also spoke to the growing interest in ethereum.  He said:  ""We have seen a great deal of liquidity pour into ether over the last few months and it's definitely led to an aggressive uptick from a pricing perspective.""

42427454,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVelh,1492682411,Take Two: Ethereum Domain Registrar Relaunches on Testnet,"An effort to create a decentralized domain registrar on top of ethereum is moving ahead, a month after its first launch was aborted.  The Ethereum Name Service (ENS), led by the Ethereum Foundation’s Alex Van de Sande and Nick Johnson, was set up to register and auction off domains tied to the platform.  The project initially launched in mid-March, but a pair of critical bugs forced the development team to pull back the app.  According to a new blog post, a reworked ENS registrar has been released on the Ropsten network, a testnet for ethereum apps. The release comes weeks after the ENS team published the results of two audits detailing the issues that led to the aborted launch. Issues identified at launch, as well as during the audit, have now been addressed, developers said.  The plan is to soft launch ENS in the weeks ahead, effectively stretching out the time in which domains become available.  ""A softer launch should provide us with more time to react to and resolve any issues. It will also make sure that popular names get the attention they deserve when they come up for auction,"" the post said.

42427462,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVf1h,1492678812,IC3 Researchers Propose ‘Solidus’ Protocol for Private Transactions,"Researchers from three universities have proposed a new process for keeping transactions confidential over a public blockchain.  The proposal, dubbed Solidus and written by researchers from Cornell University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University and the University of Maryland, outlines a way in which network participants – cited as banks in the paper – could keep both transaction values and the identities of both payer and payee hidden.  At its heart, the proposal seeks to commit the concept of a bank-intermediated transaction system to a distributed ledger framework. Solidus, according to its authors, ""closely aligns with the settlement process in the modern financial system"".  The authors explain:  ""Solidus operates in a framework based on real-world financial institutions: a modest number of banks each maintain a large number of user accounts. Within this framework, Solidus hides both transaction values and the transaction graph (ie, the identities of transacting entities) while maintaining the public verifiability that makes blockchains so appealing.""  According to the paper, Solidus is ""designed to be agnostic"" when it comes to the kind of distributed ledger it is tied to, meaning that both permissioned and open systems could be utilized.  ""While it does require a mutually-aware group of banks and transaction validation by the ledger maintainers, those maintainers can be a 'permissioned' (fixed-entity) group, an 'unpermissioned' (fully decentralized) ledger (a blockchain), or any other trustworthy append-only data structure,"" the authors write.  The paper was released as part of the Initiative for CryptoCurrencies & Contracts, an ongoing research project that began in 2015 with a $3m grant from the US government.  Read the full paper here.

Announced today via Twitter by CEO Brian Armstrong, the company is now testing a product called Token, a wallet and a browser for decentralized applications that is now operating on the ethereum testnet. The unveiling was detailed in a blog post that likened the project to WeChat, the popular social media service that has been cited as the inspiration for other blockchain payment projects of late.  In the post  , Coinbase framed Token as an extension of its long-held mission to use blockchain-based digital currencies as a means to achieve financial inclusion.  The post reads:  ""We believe that everyone in the world should have access to financial services, and with smartphones becoming ubiquitous, digital currency can make that happen.""  In addition to its Coinbase wallet service, the startup also operates another subsidiary brand, GDAX, an exchange service for digital assets and digital currencies in more than 30 US states and territories, as well as Canada, UK, Australia, Singapore and select European countries.  Among the features Token will aim to offer is a built-in reputation score that adjusts as users interact with the platform. Future upgrades outlined in the post include support for the decentralized identity platform uPort.  The blog post further indicated the product would seek to migrate to the live ethereum blockchain in the coming months, though no official timeline was made public.  As noted in the announcement, the product is similar to other efforts to create mobile wallet platforms based on ethereum, currently the second-largest public blockchain by market cap.
