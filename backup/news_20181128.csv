42429976,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM2mLh,1543445412,6 Big Takeaways from SEC Chair Clayton's Crypto Remarks,"The tea leaves were swirling Tuesday after Jay Clayton, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, dropped some hints about what regulators in the United States will (and won't) do in the crypto space in the coming months and years.  Clayton gave a fireside chat in front of a packed room at CoinDesk's Consensus: Invest event in Manhattan yesterday afternoon. And while Clayton made it clear that he has given cryptocurrency a lot of thought over the last year, there was still plenty to read between the lines, including his thoughts on the exchange ecosystem and the question of when ICO-derived tokens count as securities.  Following the on-stage conversation, three longtime experts in crypto law dissected the nuances of what Clayton said during a taping of CoinDesk Live (which you can watch below). We were joined by Caitlin Long, of the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition; Stephen Palley, of law firm Anderson Kill; and Lewis Cohen, of DLx Law.  While this panel of experts touched on a range of issues, there were some major takeaways to glean from Clayton's talk. Here's what they said:  1. No bitcoin ETF any time soon  Perhaps first and foremost, it doesn't seem like that the SEC will greenlight a bitcoin exchange-traded fund anytime soon.  ""I know there are a lot of folks who would love to have the ETF approved but I don’t think that’s very likely,"" Long said.  She pointed to third-party custody of crypto assets and market manipulation as two stated stumbling blocks for an exchange-traded fund.  On custody, Long critiqued the rule itself, saying: “I think there’s a real question as to whether a custodian is needed if all the assets are actually sitting on a blockchain.”  2. Regulated exchanges are needed  Clayton made it very clear that he did not trust existing crypto exchanges to prevent price manipulation.  The panel noted that Clayton seemed to hint that some kind of move to get bitcoin onto a regulated exchange may be underway, with panelists pointing to remarks made earlier in the day by New York Stock Exchange Chairman Jeff Sprecher.  But Cohen argued that bitcoin is a ""wild beast"" and regulators may not appreciate how hard it could be to tame.  3. The rise of ""CorpoCoin""  To further tame crypto, Clayton also made it clear that anti-money laundering protections had to be put in place for crypto trading.  Palley wondered what the implications of that push might hold for the body of retail investors that are active in the market today.  “My question is this,"" said Palley. ""There’s a lot of institutional money here. If you regulate it and you have market surveillance, will retail interest remain the same?”  Borrowing a term she credited to Andreas Antonopoulos, Long described that future as one for ""CorpoCoin,"" adding:  ""What’s going to happen if this becomes too corporatized, is the crypto community will just fork off.”  4. ICO-funded startups should go see the SEC, ASAP  Repeating a theme Clayton stressed in his talk, Cohen argued it would behoove crypto startups that raised money in 2017 and early 2018 to go to the regulators now.  Paraphrasing Clayton, Cohen said: ""Those that come see us may get one deal, those we come find may get another.”  Earlier this month the SEC issued its first civil penalties to two startups that did not properly register their securities offerings. With those ""templates"" in hand, Palley said, the SEC might be getting ready to move much faster on ICOs.  5. No action on ""no-action"" letters  One of Clayton's messages from the stage was that the SEC's doors are open to startups working in the industry, particularly those that are issuing their own tokens. To this end, the agency recently launched a new fintech-focused division with the explicit goal of fostering communication with ICO startups.  The panel agreed that what startups in this space want are so-called ""no-action"" letters (letters in which the SEC confirms that it will not move against a company based on its business model).  The letters have long been expected, but no startups have received one yet, according to Long.  “If that’s what [Clayton] really wants, for people to come get no-action letters, the U.S. is already behind and we’re gonna fall even further behind,"" she said.  6. Courts may see ICOs differently  While regulators are already on it, there's another frontier for determining the validity of new funding mechanisms for blockchain startups.  As Palley asked: “What are courts going to do when they start parsing through token sales?” In fact, it's already starting to happen.  Maybe in 10 years – or perhaps even less – Palley said, the U.S. Supreme Court may take a look.  Broadly speaking, Clayton argued from the stage that the SEC is happy to help crypto startups in the U.S. find a way to get in compliance with the law, but our panel of regulatory experts said that, in practice, this turns out to be much more difficult (and costly) than the chairman made it sound.

Users can build platforms using either Hyperledger Fabric or ethereum, though the latter is not yet available.  The new platform is another aspect of Amazon Web Services, Amazon's cloud computing subsidiary which powers a large number of websites and services, including platforms like Netflix.  ""Amazon Managed Blockchain eliminates the overhead required to create the network, and automatically scales to meet the demands of thousands of applications running millions of transactions,"" the service's website says.  Further, the company announced that the blockchain platform can store data on another database product, saying:  ""Managed Blockchain can replicate an immutable copy of your blockchain network activity into Amazon Quantum Ledger Database (QLDB), a fully managed ledger database. This allows you to easily analyze the network activity outside the network and gain insights into trends.""  The QLDB is not a blockchain platform, but can be used in conjunction with Amazon's blockchain product to ""maintain a complete and verifiable history of data changes.""  The service is currently in preview, meaning those interested can sign up. If approved, they will be able to create a blockchain network, at which point they can either invite other Amazon Web Services members or ""create more members in your account to simulate a multi-member network,"" according to an FAQ section.

42429987,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM2mfh,1543431634,Google Searches for 'Bitcoin' Just Hit Their Highest Level Since April,"Google’s trend explorer reveals the weekly number of worldwide searches for the keyword ""bitcoin"" has reached levels not seen since the first week in April.  While the exact number of searches accrued so far this week is not clear, data from Google reveals 'bitcoin' searches in the past three days alone made up 17 percent of its all-time-high weekly search volume set from Dec. 17-23, 2017.  At that time, the cryptocurrency was trading around its record high near $20,000, while at the time of writing, it is valued at $4,167 according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  Google trend data further reveals that the most searches for bitcoin in the world over the past week came from Nigeria, South Africa and Austria, in that order. Interestingly, the U.S. barely cracked into the top-20, ranking in at 19.  The seven-month high in Google searches for bitcoin perhaps should not come as a surprise since the cryptocurrency made headlines last week for its price falling to a 13-month low below $4,000. Data further reveals the searches for bitcoin more than doubled on the day it entered the $3,000 range, Nov. 24.  That said, it has long been speculated that the price of bitcoin and its Google search trends are highly correlated, which suggests the uptick may be a sign of things to come for bitcoin's price.  A study  conducted in 2017 by researcher Willy Woo shows that the Google search trends can even be used to detect speculative bubbles as well as the best and worst times to buy the cryptocurrency.  In other words, periods of low 'bitcoin' search volume have historically shown to be the points of maximum financial opportunity, whereas periods of abnormally high search volume tend to act as a warning sign that bitcoin is in a bubble and may soon experience a pullback in price.

In a video address posted to YouTube Thursday, Steemit CEO and founder Ned Scott said:  “While we were building out our team over the last many months we have been relying on projections of basically a higher bottom for the market and since that's no longer there, we've been forced to lay off more than 70 percent of our organization and begin a restructuring.”  The address did not specify how many employees Steemit had before the layoff and requests for further details were not returned by press time.  Nevertheless, elaborating on the impact of low market prices for major cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, Scott wrote in a blog post that “fiat returns” could no longer adequately cover the “growing costs of running full Steem nodes.”  Steemit is a social media platform that leverages blockchain technology to reward publishers and content curators with tokens called STEEM.  Launched in March 2016, Steemit was early on one of the six largest cryptocurrencies operating in the blockchain space with an approximate market capitalization of $157 million.

42429956,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM2iLh,1543419287,US Regulators Tie Two Bitcoin Addresses to Iranian Ransomware Plot,"The U.S. Department of the Treasury is officially adding crypto addresses to its individual sanctions list.  The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced Wednesday that it was adding two Iran residents – Ali Khorashadizadeh and Mohammad Ghorbaniyan – to its Specially Designated Nationals list, and for the first time in the list's history, bitcoin addresses associated with the individuals will be included with other identifying information, such as physical addresses, post office boxes, email addresses and aliases.  OFAC first indicated it might add crypto addresses to its list in March, when it updated its FAQ on sanctions compliance. At the time, the office highlighted the fact that cryptocurrencies are comparable to fiat currencies as far as the SDN list is concerned. As such, the office is alerting U.S. citizens that they are prohibited from sending any funds to the two addresses.  In a statement, Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Sigal Mandelker said the department "" is targeting digital currency exchangers who have enabled Iranian cyber actors to profit from extorting digital ransom payments from their victims,"" adding:  ""We are publishing digital currency addresses to identify illicit actors operating in the digital currency space. Treasury will aggressively pursue Iran and other rogue regimes attempting to exploit digital currencies and weaknesses in cyber and AML/CFT safeguards to further their nefarious objectives.""  Malicious software  Khorashadizadeh and Ghorbaniyan are being added to the list for their role in facilitating financial transactions related to the SamSam ransomware. The ransomware has hit more than 200 victims over the last few years, including corporations, hospitals, universities and government agencies.  The malicious software held these organizations' data hostage in exchange for bitcoin, according to the Treasury Department.  OFAC believes Khorashadizadeh and Ghorbaniyan converted more than 7,000 bitcoin transactions into Iranian rial, processing roughly 6,000 bitcoin, worth millions of U.S. dollars, on behalf of SamSam's creators. These transactions included bitcoin received as part of the payment from SamSam's victims.  The two then allegedly deposited the rial into Iranian banks.  According to OFAC, the two used more than 40 crypto exchanges, including some unnamed U.S.-based exchanges, to process transactions.  Any individuals or exchanges who do send funds to the two may be subject to secondary sanctions, including by being cut off from the U.S. financial system entirely.  ""As Iran becomes increasingly isolated and desperate for access to U.S. dollars, it is vital that virtual currency exchanges, peer-to-peer exchangers, and other providers of digital currency services harden their networks against these illicit schemes,"" Mandelker said.

The National Election Commission (NEC) announced the news Wednesday, saying it will begin the pilot in December with development assistance from the Ministry of Science and ICT.  The NEC’s existing online voting system, K-voting, has reportedly has been used by 5.64 million people, but there are concerns over its vulnerability to hacking and voter fraud.  The proposed blockchain system is expected to increase security and transparency, the NEC said, adding that the outcome of votes would be more “credible” with blockchain, as it is “almost impossible"" to manipulate results, while candidates and election observers would have direct access to voting data.  The pilot will help the commission create a “foundation"" for future online voting systems, it said, and could ultimately be integrated with K-voting if the trial is successful.  Specifically, the trial will see the blockchain system being used for online surveys by Seoul National University's Blockchain Society and the Korea Internet & Security Agency, a subsidiary of the science ministry.  The NEC is also looking to explore Big Data and internet of things technology for its voting system going forward.  Harnessing blockchain's transparency and immutability for voting systems has been a growing use case for the tech for some time.  Among various projects launched in recent months, Japan’s Tsukuba city government tested a blockchain-based system that lets residents cast votes to decide on local development programs in September.

In an interview with news source Cheddar on Tuesday, Coinbase head of sales Christine Sandler said that the firm launched the OTC desk as a complement to its exchange business because institutions are using OTC as an ""on-ramp for crypto trading”  In an OTC transaction, a trade takes place between two parties directly, unlike on an exchange where orders are matched between third-party buyers and sellers.  “We felt this was a huge benefit to our clients to actually leverage both our exchange and our OTC business,” Sandler said.  Currently, the OTC service is available for Coinbase Prime customers – that is, financial institutions looking to trade with business funds.  Going forward, Sandler said, the service is likely to be integrated with Coinbase Custody, its institutional product available for hedge funds and other high-net-worth clients, that was launched in July.  Coinbase first revealed its plan to offer an OTC trading desk in June, when Asiff Hirji, its chief operating officer and president said that acquiring regulatory licenses would help the firm take a “path to offer future services that include crypto securities trading, margin and over-the-counter (OTC) trading, and new market data products.”  The exchange received approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services to form a qualified custodial firm for cryptocurrencies in late October.  With the launch, Coinbase joins other notable crypto firms in offering OTC services. Goldman Sachs-backed crypto finance firm Circle also has an OTC desk called Circle Trade, available for both individual and institutional investors with a minimum ticket size of $250,00.  And, back in April, U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, unveiled block trading in bitcoin and ether, which allows customers to make high-volume trades that won’t appear in the exchange’s order book until they’ve been filled.

42429963,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM2iVh,1543404018,Back Over $4K: Bitcoin's Price Bounce is Gathering Pace,"While the bitcoin (BTC) market is still predominantly bearish, seller exhaustion near $3,500 may be paving the way to stronger corrective bounce.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization printed a 14-month low of $3,474 on Monday, having revived the long-term bear market with a convincing move below the crucial 21-month exponential moving average (EMA) support on Nov. 14.  Therefore, the path of least resistance is to the downside. A possible coming drop to the psychological support of $3,000, however, may happen after a notable bounce. This is because BTC has picked up a strong bid today, validating the bearish exhaustion signaled by a repeated defense of $3,500 in the last three days.  At press time, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $4,010 on Bitstamp, representing 8 percent gains on a 24-hour basis.  Today's positive price action also indicates the cryptocurrency is finally paying heed to oversold conditions reported by the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) since Nov. 15.  Daily chart  The long tails attached to the previous three candles, as seen in the chart above, represent bear failure near $3,500.  Further, the 14-day RSI is looking to move back into undersold territory above 30.00, having charted a bullish divergence over the weekend.  4-hour chart  Over on the 4-hour chart, BTC has cleared the falling trendline resistance (yellow line), adding credence to the bullish divergence of the RSI confirmed on Nov. 25 and the long-tailed daily candles.  As a result, BTC looks poised for a convincing move above $4,000. The recovery rally, however, may have a tough time scaling the falling channel hurdle, currently at $4,450, as the key exponential moving averages (EMAs) – 50, 100 and 200 – are still trending south in favor of the bears.  View  BTC looks to have carved out a temporary bottom around $3,500, and prices could rise to $4,400 in the next day or two.  A falling channel breakout above $4,400 may not happen in the near-term, as the EMAs are still biased toward the bears.  The long duration charts still favor a drop to $3,000 (psychological support). The bullish view put forward by the 4-hour chart would be neutralized if prices find acceptance below $3,500.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42429943,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM2hvh,1543402810,"Blockchain Smart Contracts Subject to Financial Laws, Says CFTC Primer","One of the top U.S. financial regulators, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), has released its second guide to understanding smart contracts, with a reminder that the technology is covered under financial rules.  Announced  Tuesday, the primer is part of agency’s fintech initiative LabCFTC. Described as an ""educational tool"" rather than official policy, it covers the basics of blockchain smart contracts including their history, characteristics, case studies, potential use cases and perceived risks.  Stating that the concept of a smart contract was discovered some 20 years ago by computer scientist Nick Szabo, the CFTC states that the self-executing programs are only as smart as the “information feed it receives and the machine code that directs it.”  The agency says that smart contracts can offer the benefits of reduced costs and transaction times, lowered counterparty and settlement risks, and increased security. At the same time, though, they present challenges, including operational, technical and cybersecurity risks, alongside the potential for fraud, manipulation, reduced transparency and accountability, says the CFTC.  On the topic of regulation, the CFTC points out that that smart contracts are subject to existing laws, including the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and anti-money laundering (AML) rules, depending on their application or the type of product they are linked to.  “Existing law and regulation apply equally regardless what form a contract takes. Contracts or constituent parts of contracts that are written in code are subject to otherwise applicable law and regulation,” the primer reads.  In order to protect investors and their capital, the agency said, it will ensure that all transactions are subject to the CEA.  The LabCFTC initiative was launched in May last year and the first primer was released in October 2017 on virtual currencies covers the basics of the technology, as well as a number of use cases.  The guide also comes just over a month after a Brian Quintenz, a commissioner at the CFTC, warned that smart contract coders could be held liable if they knowingly use the technology to create functions that are considered predictive “event contracts.”  CFTC image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | COMMODITY | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Yogita Khatri,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/11/28/blockchain-smart-contracts-subject-to-financial-laws-says-cftc-primer,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eea8e89bbd07520af57f9459a0d71ba116739b47-1485x1023.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42429942,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM2hxh,1543388346,"Goldman, Morgan Stanley Go Live With CLS' IBM-Powered Blockchain","CLS, the bank-owned currency trading utility, and IBM have gone live with their blockchain-based payment netting service after more than two years in development.  Investment banking giants Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are the first companies to use the newly launched CLSNet, with six more participants from North America, Europe and Asia, including Bank of China (Hong Kong), committed to joining in the next few months, according to CLS and IBM.  Ram Komarraju, managing director for technology at CLS, told CoinDesk the system is up and running, saying:  ""We have matched and confirmed the first transactions and successfully issued a netting report to the counterparties.""  Along with the food-tracking blockchain IBM Food Trust launched in October, and the trade finance platform we.trade, which went live in late June, CLSNet is the third blockchain consortium powered by IBM tech to go into production this year.  As such, it's one of the few major enterprise distributed ledger technology (DLT) projects of any stripe to get this far.  “With CLSNet now in production with two of the world's largest banks, for a major market function, it is a testament to the ongoing maturity of blockchain technology and the value that it can deliver in practice,” said Marie Wieck, general manager at IBM Blockchain, in a press release.  The launch of CLSNet, she said, represents “the first post-trade production deployment of blockchain technology in a global market utility.”  Filling in gaps  Though not a household name, CLS provides critical plumbing to the foreign exchange, or forex, markets. Founded in 2002, it mitigates settlement risk for participating banks with a ""payment versus payment"" service, in which both sides of a trade are completed at the same time.  But its new platform aims to solve current issues in the forex market, such as a lack of standardization and automation.  For example, a limited number of participants currently net trades with each other on a regular basis, and even when they do, often there is a need to manage the process manually, according to IBM and CLS. In addition, many participants do not net the payments for forex trades, instead settling on a gross basis, which exposes them to settlement risk and leads to higher intraday liquidity demands, the companies said.  ""CLSNet will deliver the standardization and automation needed for non-CLS settled transactions,"" said Adam Josephart, managing director of the fixed-income division at Morgan Stanley.  Barry Lo, general manager for the bank-wide operation department of Bank of China (Hong Kong), added that CLSNet in particular ""will enhance operational efficiency in trade matching and payment netting for non-CLS settled currencies such as CNH [the offshore version of China's renminbi], and strengthen our risk management.""  The now-live CLSNet works for over 120 fiat currencies and is designed to standardize and increase the level of payment netting in the foreign exchange market. It was developed in collaboration with buy-side and sell-side institutions. At the same time, the platform supports compliance with a code of conduct for the foreign exchange markets that CLS helped to develop, the company stated.  “A standardized and automated payment netting process will lead to improved intraday liquidity, reduced cost, improved operational efficiencies and ultimately support business growth,” said Alan Marquard, chief strategy and development officer at CLS.  Early explorer  CLS and IBM developed CLSNet on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain. But CLS has been experimenting with blockchain technology since early 2015, before the Hyperledger consortium started.  Those attempts eventually grew into CLSNet, with Bank of America, Bank of China, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Citibank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley on board when the project was unveiled in September 2017.  From the beginning, CLS worked with IBM on blockchain solutions. However, in May of this year, the forex trading utility announced a $5 million investment in another major enterprise DLT vendor, R3.  Yet R3's platform will not be used for the current services CLS is working on, Komarraju told CoinDesk.  ""Our investment in R3 has no impact on the future development of our products using Hyperledger Fabric, as we do not believe that DLT should be a ‘one-network universe,'"" he said, adding:  ""We believe that the industry will benefit from a choice in providers, which is why we have chosen to align ourselves with two key providers, R3 and IBM, in the DLT space.""  Meanwhile, CLS and IBM have expanded their collaboration. This summer the two companies announced a proof of concept for a separate project named LedgerConnect, a financial blockchain “app store” offering DLT-based services for know-your-customer processes, sanctions screening, collateral management, derivatives post-trade processing and reconciliation and market data.

That partnership was officially unveiled during CoinDesk's Consensus: Invest conference, when Gabor Gurbacs – VanEck's director of digital asset strategy – announced the move to ""bring a regulated crypto 2.0 futures-type contract"" to the market.  According to Gurbacs, what they're planning to release early next year is to be the first of several such products.  “What I’d like to point out is we ran a few extra miles working with the [Commodity Futures Trading Commission] to bring about new standards for custody and surveillance,"" he commented during a panel.  In a follow-up interview, Gurbacs told CoinDesk that these futures products could be thought of as an ""upgrade"" to current regulatory standards that surround bitcoin futures products.  By leveraging Nasdaq's stock markets surveillance system, called SMARTS, as well as the trusted pricing benchmarks provided by MVIS, the aim is to “inspire confidence with regulators and institutions trying to get involved [in the crypto markets],"" according to Gurbacs.  SMARTS is a software hosting hundreds of detection algorithms designed to automatically pick-up on suspicious market activity such as spoofing and wash trading. Calling it the ""big policeman engine,"" Gurbacs explained the technology would ensure bitcoin futures trading “in a fair and orderly fashion.""  State of play  As it stands, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has approved two bitcoin futures products to date - one operated by the Chicago Board Options Exchange in partnership with Gemini Exchange and the other operated by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in partnership with Crypto Facilities.  These futures contracts are cash-settled, meaning that at expiration no “physical” bitcoins need to be moved in order to settle accounts. In contrast, a concurrent bitcoin futures product expected to launch in January of next year operated by the Intercontinental Exchange-backed company Bakkt will be physically-settled, meaning investors holding these contracts at expiration would receive payment in bitcoin.  Gurbacs didn't disclose whether the anticipated bitcoin futures product between Nasdaq and VanEck’s price indexing arm MVIS would be similarly cash-backed. Representatives at Nasdaq also declined to comment further on the matter.  Still, Gurbacs hinted that ""there's lots to look forward to in 2019,” emphasizing a hopeful launch date for the bitcoin futures product in Q1 of next year.  What’s more, the physical-backed bitcoin exchange-traded fund proposed by VanEck in partnership with blockchain technology company SolidX is also expected to reach a final decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission by February 27, 2019.  Seeing “an exciting Q1 coming up,” Gurbacs predicted:  “We believe that 2018 was the year of regulation and 2019 will be the year of implementation.”  Photo by Stan Higgins for CoinDesk",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/11/28/nasdaq-vaneck-partner-to-launch-crypto-20-futures-contracts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2d62ff55b0b96af0cbdff5c27c1b9030fd7d8219-1500x926.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
