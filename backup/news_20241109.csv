Interestingly, the market has already been given a taste of the possible effects. Related Reading: SEC Shake-Up: Robinhood Legal Boss On Shortlist For Top Spot—Report In fact, the mere news of Trump’s win has pushed the Bitcoin price into uncharted territory. Since the announcement, Bitcoin has surged, reaching a recent peak of $77,239. According to a crypto analyst, the Bitcoin price has always rallied after US elections, but the price surge tends to be even more pronounced after a Trump win. Can The Trump Win Continue To Push Bitcoin Price Upwards? Crypto analyst Tony “The Bull” Severino, CMT, recently took to social media platform X to highlight an intriguing historical pattern between Donald Trump’s presidential victories and Bitcoin’s price movements. According to Severino, while Bitcoin has consistently rallied following US elections, the price surge was especially pronounced when Trump was first elected in 2016. Severino backed up his analysis with data from Bitcoin’s November 2016 performance on the two-month candlestick chart. At that time, Bitcoin was trading at approximately $725. After that election, the Bitcoin price went on to create seven consecutive bullish candlesticks following Trump’s win, setting off a remarkable rally that continued into 2017 and laid the foundation for Bitcoin’s ascent to its then-record highs. Now, with Bitcoin currently trading around $76,000 in the wake of Trump’s latest victory, Severino speculates whether the cryptocurrency could replicate this historical pattern. Interestingly, the analyst believes a repeat of this run could happen with Trump’s win, and Bitcoin could now make its move toward $100,000 per coin. Will Bitcoin Soar To $170,000 This Cycle? Still in the spirit of a bullish crypto market after Trump’s win, Tony Severino mentioned the possibility of the Bitcoin price soaring to $170,000 in the coming months. In another technical analysis, Tony highlighted the Bitcoin price action from October 2023 using Elliott Waves. According to this outlook, Bitcoin is about to start a fifth impulse wave, which is known to be the third and last bullish wave. With this in mind, the analyst pointed to Bitcoin pushing to reach $170,000 in 2025. “Are you prepared?” he asked. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $76,450, having established a new all-time high of $77,239 in the past 12 hours. The streak of all-time highs seems like it isn’t stopping anytime soon, as the market continues to reel in bullish momentum.

With the crypto market leader recording new all-time highs each day, analyst Ali Martinez has dropped a new price target that hinges on a certain condition. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Enters Danger Zone: Investors Now Extremely Greedy Bitcoin Must Stay Above $71,480 – Here’s Why Amidst the current Bitcoin price rally, Ali Martinez predicts the digital asset could reach a local price peak of $85,360. However, this price action can only occur if BTC’s value does not decline below $71,480 based on data from the MVRV Deviation Pricing Bands, a trading tool used to identify extreme bullish and bearish market conditions based on the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV). Martinez’s latest insight on Bitcoin’s trajectory follows a previous prediction in which the analyst forecasted the premier cryptocurrency to retrace to around $71,500 after hitting the $78,000 price mark. With Bitcoin within range of this price target following its recent tourney across $77,000, it is imperative that the market bulls prevent any potential retracement below $71,480, which may result in a further decline to $66,000 at which lies its next major resistance. Alternatively, Bitcoin is also well poised to push beyond $78,000, reaching Martinez’s target of $85,360 without experiencing any projected price pullback as market sentiments remain highly bullish due to multiple factors. Aside from Donald Trump’s resounding electoral victory which signals an incoming crypto-friendly approach by the US Government, high inflows into the Bitcoin Spot ETFs over the past weeks have also boosted investors’ confidence in Bitcoin’s continuous profitability. Nevertheless, all investors are admonished to remain vigilant as the crypto market is subject to high levels of volatility and sudden price movements.

Sounds ‘Bearish’: Expert Hints At Even Greater Heights Ahead BTC Social Narrative Backs Potential Retrace In other news, data from analytics firm Santiment shows that Bitcoin’s rise above $77,000 has induced a change in the social narrative as the general crypto community is anticipating a continuous rise to $80,000. According to Santiment, whenever crypto enthusiasts have been overly eager about $80,000 in the past month, Bitcoin has experienced a price retrace. Therefore, there is a need to reduce growing notions around FOMO in order to allow Bitcoin to maintain its current price rally.

36007517,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652317,1731182413,Chainlink Hits $13.5 For The First Time Since July – Smart Money Accumulation?,"Chainlink (LINK) has surged impressively over the past few days, breaking above the critical $13 resistance level and posting a remarkable 35% gain. This recent breakout has ignited optimism among analysts and investors, as LINK has faced strong resistance around the $13 mark since late July, struggling to sustain any upward momentum. Now, however, market sentiment appears to be shifting, with many anticipating further upside for Chainlink. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Sees Altseason Potential As BTS Is Still Outpacing ETH – Time To Buy Altcoins? Supporting this bullish outlook, key data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment reveals that LINK whale activity has reached a 3-month high, with large holders accumulating LINK in significant quantities. This increased whale activity is often an indicator of confidence among major investors, suggesting that Chainlink’s latest surge could be just the beginning of a more sustained rally. As LINK breaks free from its months-long resistance and gains renewed momentum, the next few days will be crucial in determining whether this rally has the strength to reach higher price levels or if it will encounter fresh resistance. For now, however, Chainlink’s impressive performance has analysts speculating on its potential to maintain bullish momentum in the coming weeks. Chainlink Whales Waking Up Chainlink is showing signs of renewed strength, with the price surging above key resistance levels that have held the coin back for months. For the first time since July, LINK has broken past $13.65, marking a significant shift in its price action. This breakout has come at a time when critical data points are signaling a bullish outlook for the asset. According to Santiment, Chainlink has decoupled from the broader altcoin market, showing a unique price performance amidst a recovering market. One of the most compelling indicators is the spike in whale activity, which has reached a 3-month high. Stakeholders holding between 100K to 10M LINK have accumulated a massive $369.8 million worth of the token in just 7 weeks, representing an 8.2% increase in their holdings. This surge in whale activity often signals confidence in a token’s future price potential, with large investors positioning themselves for the next leg of growth. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs See Historic Surge – Institutions Go Bullish On BTC With $1.38 Billion Record Inflows Accumulation by Chainlink whales, combined with its price-breaking key resistance levels, suggests that LINK is poised for continued growth in the coming weeks. As the entire market begins to recover and rise again, Chainlink’s decoupling from the pack could indicate that it’s positioning itself to lead the charge in the altcoin space. Investors are watching closely, as the recent price surge and whale behavior suggest LINK could experience sustained bullish momentum. LINK Testing New Supply Chainlink is currently trading at $13.5 after successfully breaking above the 200-day moving average (MA) at $12.9, a key level that signals a strong, bullish outlook for the long term. This breakout has given bulls control, reinforcing positive sentiment around LINK’s price action. For the uptrend to continue, it’s crucial that LINK holds the 200-day MA as support, as this level often marks a turning point between the bear and bull phases. While LINK shows strength above $13, a healthy retrace to around $12.5 could provide the fuel needed for further upside if that level holds as support. A pullback of this nature would allow bulls to consolidate gains and set a stronger foundation for the next move. Related Reading: Solana Breaks Above Key Resistance – Top Analyst Sets $300 Target Traders are eyeing $14.5 as the next significant supply zone, where LINK may face resistance as it approaches this level. If LINK manages to push above $14.5, it would signal robust demand and potentially open the door to even higher levels in the coming weeks, as whale activity and overall market sentiment support further gains.

36003496,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652302,1731177058,Bitcoin Accumulation Ramps Up: Investors Scoop $4.16 Billion In Four Days,"The price of Bitcoin has turned in an impressive performance, forging successive all-time highs over the past week. Similarly, other large-cap assets, such as Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano, have been experiencing massive upside movement in the past few days. Interestingly, the latest on-chain observation suggests that the crypto market — particularly Bitcoin — may not be done just yet. This projection is as investors seem to be doubling down on their positions rather than selling off their assets for some short-term gains. Bitcoin Investors Continue To Load Their Bags Popular crypto pundit Ali Martinez took to the X platform to reveal that Bitcoin accumulation addresses have been witnessing significant inflows over the last few days. This on-chain revelation is based on the spike in CryptoQuant’s “Inflows to Accumulation Addresses” metric. Related Reading: Ethereum Jumps 10% As DeFi Sentiment Rebounds With Trump’s Victory Accumulation addresses can be defined as addresses, excluding miners’ and exchange addresses, that have zero outgoing transactions or at least haven’t spent their holdings over a period. Moreover, these addresses must have received at least two incoming transfers and hold more than 10 BTC. These Bitcoin addresses are usually controlled by major entities, including whales, institutional players, and so on. According to data from CryptoQuant, a whopping 57,800 BTC (equivalent to approximately $4.16 billion) has made its way to these accumulation addresses since November 3. As shown in the chart below, inflows into the Bitcoin accumulation addresses have been on the rise in recent weeks. Typically, this positive trend is a favorable sign for the price of BTC, which has been on a ride of its own in the past few days. The choice to “hodl” rather than sell for profit also indicates the increased faith in the long-term success of Bitcoin, implying that major investors expect the flagship cryptocurrency to keep rising. As of this writing, the Bitcoin price stands at around $76,550, reflecting a measly 1% increase in the past 24 hours. However, the market leader is up by more than 10% on the weekly timeframe. USDT Netflow On Exchanges Surpasses $2 Billion According to a recent Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, there has been a significant inflow of the USDT stablecoin into centralized exchanges. On-chain data shows that the stablecoin’s net inflows have crossed $2 billion, its highest level since December 2022. Related Reading: Cardano Price Prediction: Analyst Sounds Alarm Of Break Through Key Resistance, Why A Rally Could Follow Higher stablecoin balances (which are often used as an indicator of increased liquidity) suggest a high amount of buying power for investors, leading to elevated investor demand.

SolarEdge ( SEDG ) shares plunged 25% after the solar-equipment maker reported disappointing quarterly results and issued a downside guidance for Q4. The company took a $1.03B write down in Q3 and warned margins for the current quarter will be non-existent or even negative. Palantir Technologies ( PLTR ) shares rose 16% to an all-time high on Tuesday after the software firm’s third quarter results and outlook beat estimates, drawing praise from Wall Street analysts. High demand for the Colorado-based company's artificial intelligence software has catapulted Palantir shares 252% year to date. Super Micro Computer ( SMCI ) was in focus after the embattled artificial intelligence server maker reported preliminary fiscal first-quarter revenue that was below the company’s stated guidance. The company also addressed the situation related to its delayed 10-K, and said it has seen no evidence of fraud or misconduct, but that it remains difficult to say when the report will be filed. SMCI closed -3.7% down on Friday at $24.52, way below its 52-week high of $122.90. Doximity ( DOCS ) added 37% over the week after the online medical platform exceeded Street forecasts with its second quarter results and raised its full-year outlook, leading to upgrades on Wall Street. Enphase Energy ( ENPH ) tumbled after the company announced plans to reduce its global workforce by ~17%, affecting ~500 employees and contractors, causing it to incur $17M-$20M in restructuring and asset impairment charges, including ~$14M in Q4. Medical Properties Trust ( MPW ) stock tumbled on Thursday after the hospital REIT's Q3 earnings continued to reflect its largest tenant's financial woes and removal from its portfolio. The company's bottom-line was hurt by $608M of impairment charges, ~$131M of net negative fair value adjustments, and $137M accelerated non-cash amortization of in-place lease intangibles related to Steward real estate. Shares of President-elect Donald Trump’s media company Trump Media & Technology ( DJT ) surged nearly 27% as the market reacted positively to news of his return to the presidency, following his victory over Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. Trump reaffirmed on his social media platform that he will not be selling any shares in the company. DJT shares have climbed 83% so far this year, but have seen periods of significant volatility. Celanese ( CE ) fell 33% after the maker of specialty materials and chemicals said it would cut its quarterly dividend by 95% starting in the first quarter of 2025, while reporting quarterly results that missed Wall Street estimates. Solar and clean energy stocks saw a rough week as traders digested Donald Trump’s historic win and re-election as the 47th President of the U.S. Trump’s last administration dismantled several major climate policies and over 100 environmental regulations around clean air, water, wildlife and toxic chemicals. Major decliners included: First Solar ( FSLR ) -7.6% , Enphase Energy ( ENPH ) -21% , Sunrun ( RUN ) -32% , SolarEdge Technologies ( SEDG ) -24.5% , Canadian Solar ( CSIQ ) -22.8% , Sunnova Energy ( NOVA ) -46% , JinkoSolar ( JKS ) -15.8% , Daqo New Energy ( DQ ) -6.8% . Tesla ( TSLA ) jumped 31% for the week, a rally partly fueled by Trump’s re-election. Elon Musk had publicly endorsed the former president, paying tens of millions of dollars to his campaign. The automaker also reclaimed $1T market cap with a swing higher on Friday of 6.7%. Prison stocks, The GEO Group ( GEO ) +78% and CoreCivic ( CXW ) +71% , soared as Trump clinched victory.

This comes amid ADA’s recent rally, which could mark the beginning of its bull run, having underperformed for most of the year. When The Cardano Price Could Cross $5 In a TradingView post, Babenski revealed that the Cardano price could cross $5 by 2025 year-end or the start of 2026. As part of his analysis, the analyst also noted that Cardao printed a falling wedge on the weekly chart and had broken out. With this development, he remarked that the main target for this price breakout is around $1. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Forecast: Analyst Says Downside Is Minimized As 1M, 3M, And 6M Candles Turn Bullish However, if the Cardano price holds above this $1 target, Babenski is confident that ADA can replicate its 2021 bull run pattern, which could spark the ADA rally to $5 and above. A rally to this price level will mark a new all-time high (ATH) for the Cardano price, whose current ATH is $3. The Cardano price has been one of the worst performers since the start of the year, with a 26% year-to-date (YTD) loss. However, there is a growing feeling that the ADA bull run is set to begin. For context, the ADAprice is up over 22% in the last seven days, its largest weekly gains this year. ADA whales also look to be bullish on the Cardano price again, as IntoTheBlock data shows a surge in whale activity. The on-chain analytics platform Santiment also revealed that there were recently 697 ADA whale transactions that involved $100,000 transfers and above, close to the highest figure recorded since the Cardano price bottomed on September 4. Meanwhile, 37,892 unique ADA addresses made transfers in a single day, the most since September 4. In line with this, Santiment predicts that ADA might witness some retail FOMO soon enough. ADA Entering Its Most Bullish Phase Crypto analyst Javon Marks also recently provided a bullish outlook for the Cardano price, stating that ADA may be entering its most bullish phase. He noted that ADA is now returning with “major strength,” proving that a price breakout could be imminent. The analyst further provided insights into how high the Cardano price could rise. Related Reading: Large Transaction Volume Crashes 36% In 24 Hours As Dogecoin Price Fails At $0.2, Are Whales Selling? Javon Marks stated that the first breakout target remains a price rally of over 531% to $2.7709. Meanwhile, based on historical trends in the previous bull cycles, he claimed that the Cardano price could enjoy a price rally of over 1,700% and rise to $7.77. His accompanying chart showed that any price rally to $7 will likely occur in 2025. At the time of writing, the ADA price is trading at around $0.43, up almost 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42435187,vcdRFSInNZZ7jTkxATLRW5,1731167796,Why Bitcoin Will Soar Above Its Fresh Record: Van Straten,"Bitcoin {{BTC}} keeps hitting new highs, propelled above $77,000 on Nov. 8 for the first time ever by crypto industry optimism about Donald Trump winning the U.S. presidential election.  Other cryptocurrencies are soaring, too. Ethereum's ether {{ETH}}, for instance, just surpassed $3,000 for the first time since August.  What's intriguing is that instead of selling off, bitcoin plowed through prior highs on Nov. 6 ($76,400), Nov. 7 ($76,900) and Nov. 8 ($77,200). Gold and U.S. equities are doing the same thing, hitting highs and then breaking them.  This illustrates how strong the current rally is — and how likely it is to continue.  Bitcoin's Google search interest is way below highs  The bitcoin rally can keep going due to several factors. First, Google searchers' interest in the term is still relatively low. Searches were considerably higher in November 2021 and March 2024, so, even though search interest has perked up in the past week, this suggests we are far away from market euphoria.  Profit-taking is below the 2017 all-time high  CoinDesk has been monitoring profit-taking over the past few weeks. Are investors cashing in as bitcoin soars?  They are. Glassnode data shows that on Nov. 6, the day after the U.S. election, $3.5 billion of profit was realized as bitcoin jumped from $68,000 to $76,000, while the total for the next two days was $3.2 billion.  However, even though this may seem like a lot, it's tiny compared with prior all-time highs. In March, when bitcoin finally rose above its 2021 record, profit-taking soared to $10 billion. Throughout the 2021 bull run, it got as high as $6 billion.  It was even higher in 2017 — sometimes around $4.6 billion — when bitcoin records were around $20,000. Current profit-taking isn't even topping that despite bitcoin's price being far higher.  Bitcoin has been stuck between $50,000 and $70,000 for seven months. Despite breaking out of that range, investors are patiently waiting for higher prices.  Bitcoin is still below the inflation-adjusted record  Using inflation from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, you can measure how much purchasing power has been lost versus previous years. Bitcoin's November 2021 record of around $69,000 converts to about $78,000 in today's U.S. dollars, barely above its current price.  Investors may want more for their bitcoin on an inflation-adjusted basis.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | TRADING,James Van Straten,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/09/why-bitcoin-will-soar-above-its-fresh-record-van-straten,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e50a37422f02f18dca39729fe5be84729a67eb44-1800x1013.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

35995377,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652305,1731166253,Ethereum Funding Rates Hit Key Bullish Level – Price Surge Ahead?,"Following Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election on November 5, Ethereum (ETH), alongside the general cryptocurrency market, has experienced notable price gains. In particular, the second-largest cryptocurrency has witnessed its value increase by 24.31% in the past four days as it approaches a crucial $3,000 resistance zone. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Sees Altseason Potential As BTS Is Still Outpacing ETH – Time To Buy Altcoins? Ethereum Prepares For Potential Surge As Funding Rates Hit 0.02 Amidst the recent price rally in the last week, crypto analyst Burak Kesmeci notes that Ethereum funding rates have now climbed above 0.02, which can be described as a strong bullish signal. Generally, funding rates are periodic payments made between traders in the perpetual future contracts during funding intervals. A funding rate of 0.02 indicates long position domination and demands that long traders pay 2% of the notional value of their position to short traders in order to maintain the price of perpetual contracts close to the spot market price of an asset. According to Kesmeci, long positions in futures markets are crucial to initiating strong bull rallies in the same vein as spot market acquisitions. Interestingly, historical data as shared by the analyst shows that Ethereum has consistently experienced a major price uptrend whenever funding rates have risen and stayed above 0.02. For context, when funding rates hit 0.02 on July 1, 2020, the ETH market recorded a price gain of over 100% in 50 days. Likewise, on November 2, 2020, Ethereum also embarked on a bullish course surging by over 1000% in 350 days. Most recently, Kesmeci notes that the altcoin’s price grew by 150% in 150 days as the funding rates crossed 0.02 on October 4, 2023. Therefore, the analyst postulates ETH may be primed for a robust bullish run in the coming days. In addition, this potential uptrend is expected to influence other altcoin markets due to Ethereum’s position as the largest altcoin by market cap. Related Reading: Ethereum L2 Project Spark Launches On-Chain Order Book On Fuel Network To Enhance Trading ETH Meets Crucial $3,000 Resistance Level With Ethereum’s price hovering above $2,900, the token is set to soon encounter a major resistance at the $3,000 price mark. According to a report by blockchain analytics company IntoTheBlock, this particular resistance level which can be described as a historically significant demand zone is normally expected to provide much opposition to Ethereum’s ascent. However, the current bullish momentum in the ETH market is likely to subdue this resistance, allowing the asset to maintain its current rally. If Ethereum breaks beyond $3,000, the altcoin could attain a $4,000 price target. Albeit a rejection would result in ETH trading as low as $2,400.

35991363,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652299,1731160854,"Bitcoin Realized Cap At All-Time High As Price Hits $77,000 For The First Time","The Bitcoin price and the entire crypto market have been on a tear since the outcome of the United States elections was announced in the early hours of Wednesday, November 6. The premier cryptocurrency specifically has breached and printed new all-time high prices over the past few days. Interestingly, the price of BTC has shown no signs of weakness going into the weekend, with the market leader forging a new record high above $77,000 on Friday, November 8. While the hot streak of the Bitcoin price can be attributed to the latest victory of former president Donald Trump in the US, on-chain data suggests that this rally has been a long time coming. BTC’s Realized Cap Experiences Largest Increase In Two Years One of the latest on-chain metrics to offer an interesting insight into the meteoric rise of Bitcoin’s price is the realized cap indicator. In a November 8 post on the X platform, blockchain analytics firm Glassnode revealed that Bitcoin’s realized cap recently reached a new all-time high of $656 billion. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Forecast: Analyst Says Downside Is Minimized As 1M, 3M, And 6M Candles Turn Bullish For clarity, the realized cap metric measured the value of each Bitcoin as at the last time they were transacted. This offers a more interesting way to evaluate the cost basis (the time in which the coins changed hands) as opposed to the regular market capitalization, which is derived by multiplying the total number of circulating coins by the current market price. Data from Glassnode shows that the Bitcoin realized cap witnessed a 3.8% upswing in the past 30 days, which represents one of the metric’s largest increases since January 2023. As shown in the chart below, this metric has been experiencing positive growth since the start of the year, as the 30-day net change has mostly been green. It is worth mentioning that the realized cap metric also represents the amount of capital flowing in and out of the flagship cryptocurrency. The latest increase reflects a net capital inflow of over $2.5 billion in the past month, suggesting the entry of new investors — both retail and institutional investors. With the realized cap and Bitcoin price consolidating over the past few months, a sudden increase of the former to $656 billion suggests that the premier cryptocurrency might be moving from the “reaccumulation” phase to a markup phase. Ultimately, a continuation of the capital inflow trend could sustain the increase in the Bitcoin price over the next couple of months. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin is valued at around $76,700, having lost its hold above the historical $77,000 level. According to CoinGecko data, the market leader is up by an impressive 10% in the past week.

Trump's promises to replace SEC Chairman, create a US Sovereign Bitcoin Reserve, and lower interest rates are key catalysts for Bitcoin's growth. The potential for a Trump administration to support Bitcoin mining rights and self-custody of digital assets further strengthens the bullish outlook. Investors should monitor macroeconomic factors and Trump's ability to deliver on promises, as failure could lead to near-term volatility. Investment Thesis Now that election results have been published showing overwhelming support for a Trump 2.0 presidency, it is time for businesses and investors to realign their outlook and shift their operating strategies that align with the policy framework of the incoming US President while keeping a tab of the broader economic narrative. While this year’s House election results are still to come in, the GOP is quite close to building on its incumbency in the House, pointing to a repeat of 2016 where President Trump was bolstered by support from the GOP that had control in the Senate and the House. This should give President Trump an easier path to execute his agenda as laid out in his 2024 election mandate . Although digital assets and cryptocurrency took up some much smaller real estate in Trump’s 2.0 mandate document, piecing together the incoming president’s commentary from multiple sources indicates that cryptocurrency, headlined by Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), will play a larger role in President Trump’s second term. Of all the promises that Trump has made on supporting Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency community, I find the likelihood is high for his team to deliver on at least X of those promises next year, which is positive for Bitcoin. In addition, the ongoing strength of Bitcoin’s onchain indicators suggests Bitcoin’s rally is slated to continue higher. I remain bullish on Bitcoin and reiterate my Bullish recommendation. 3 promises That Can Be Delivered By Trump 2.0 Next Year I have repeatedly expressed my confidence in Bitcoin through the year, where I explained how broader macroeconomic indicators were ripe for Bitcoin, and this coincided with onchain indicators that supported the upward trajectory of Bitcoin. In fact, when Bitcoin corrected in August, I published another research note at the time explaining why the correction was unwarranted since it had no relation with the liquidity concerns coming out of Japan’s “Yentervention.” To me, that correction presented a buying opportunity, which I took advantage of and upped my stake in Bitcoin. At Bitcoin’s current juncture, I continue to hold a favorable outlook on Bitcoin and believe the elections will support a positive narrative over the next twelve months as we usher in a new president. In Trump’s election mandate, his team made a small mention of how his government will “defend the right to mine Bitcoin” while ensuring “every American has the right to self-custody of their Digital Assets.” While that doesn’t say as much as the other sections of his mandate, Trump’s commentary from various speaking engagements through this year strongly indicates the direction his governmental framework will work towards when it comes to supporting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. 1. Replacing the SEC Chairman Current SEC chairman Gary Gensler’s policy framework has not been well received by the crypto community, with over 100 enforcement actions against various actors and entities in the crypto community leading to crypto-related fines rising by over 3000% percent in just one year to $4.7B. Chairman Gensler’s term was mired with lawsuits and obscurity and an often comical vagueness that led to confusion among developers, innovators, and investors in the crypto community. A recent example of the back-and-forth by the SEC was when the commission closed its investigation again into its claim of Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) being a security. Trump has strongly indicated multiple times in the past that he would replace Chairman Gensler with someone who is viewed as more friendly towards the crypto network. Although Chairman Gensler’s term ends in June 2026, some market analysts expect Chairman Gensler to step down . Heath Tarbert or Dan Gallagher, both ex-SEC alumni and currently serving as Chief Legal Officers of their respective for-profit crypto companies, are strong contenders and viewed positively by the crypto community. Any change in SEC’s leadership is bound to spark a strong rally among Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. 2. The US Government’s own Sovereign Bitcoin Reserve Most recently in the Nashville Bitcoin conference earlier this year, President Trump pledged to create an advisory council responsible for designing “transparent regulatory guidance for the benefit of the entire industry” and has mentioned to do so within 100 days of being elected as President. The inauguration of an advisory council would most likely be another near-term positive catalyst for Bitcoin, although the longer-term framework policies still need to be seen. Still, part of the council’s policy framework would be to create concrete steps towards fortifying the base for a US SBR (Strategic Bitcoin Reserve) that the incoming President envisions to be built on top of the existing Bitcoin custody that law enforcement has confiscated from bad actors in the system. That figure currently stands at ~$15 billion per exhibit B. Trump’s allure for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is a reversal in sentiment from his earlier presidency, and, during this year, the incoming president also started accepting cryptocurrency donations and minting his own NFTs before that. Exhibit A: US Government’s custody of Bitcoin currently stands at ~$15 billion. (Arkham) However, it’s not fully clear yet as to how the US government’s current Bitcoin holdings can be absorbed into an SBR since most of the Bitcoin here is confiscated and is likely held to be returned back to the victims of previous crypto scams. Trump has also loosely suggested in the past that these reserves could be used in the future to pay off the $35 trillion national debt. But again, any concrete steps towards building a reserve and at least codifying policies to create the SBR will be a huge catalyst towards Bitcoin’s price. 3. Lower Interest Rates Perhaps the most important factor and one with an immediate impact on Bitcoin’s price would be the movement of interest rates. Trump has been a strong proponent of lowering interest rates, which is part of his larger mandate to lower costs and prices for American consumers. At the National Association of Black Journalists’ annual convention in July this year , he said he would “bring interest rates way down.” Although the governance of interest rates falls under the purview of the Federal Reserve and is outside the authority of a US President, watching interest rates and any other monetary or fiscal catalyst that can impact interest rates is crucial to forming the outlook for Bitcoin, Gold, and any other inflation hedge. Despite this, expect Trump to be watching the interest rate line closely. The US Fed cut interest rates by another 25 bp this week, now targeting the 4.50%-4.75% range. This should have a positive impact on the global money supply, as I have mentioned in the past, which is forward-positive for Bitcoin, as can be seen in the chart below: Exhibit B: As global money supply is set to rise after interest rate cuts, Bitcoin’s momentum should continue into next year. (bGeometrics) Onchain Metrics Look Healthy, Looking For More Strength The correction in Bitcoin prices pushed many investors away from Bitcoin, leading to less than seen activity. However, the number of active addresses increasing is a good positive sign for the network, seeing one of the best increases in months. Even better is the active participation from newer addresses, as seen below. Exhibit C: Bitcoin’s onchain metrics look stable and might be about to get better (Various sources) The monthly transaction volume from these accounts has been lukewarm, but I am encouraged by the spurt in growth seen in the 7-day moving average of on-chain volume, which should be positive for Bitcoin. I expect these trends to continue to get better as the political narrative shapes up based on the points discussed in this research note. Risks & Other Factors To Look For With all the optimism with a new Trump 2.0 tenure about crypto, investors must be cautious about risks associated with some of the changes that could be pushed by the incoming administration. While Trump has repeatedly threatened to fire previous officials, such as the current SEC Chairperson as well as the current Fed Chair, any unceremonious removal that does not follow due procedure might set dangerous precedent and could be seen as a risk by the investor community. While Fed Chair Powell has explicitly stated that “ he wouldn’t resign ,” SEC Chair Gensler has remained quiet so far, which may indicate that he would resign himself, paving the way for the next Trump-appointed SEC Chair. On a broader level, investors must also assess the macroeconomic landscape, especially the global money supply levels, which, in my opinion, remain one of the strongest indicators to assess the forward outlook for Bitcoin. Lastly, and most importantly, if Trump fails to deliver on these promises, investors should expect some near-to-midterm volatility, especially if there are no concrete steps taken by the Trump 2.0 administration within 100 days. Takeaway I believe Bitcoin should be able to move higher, potentially even reaching the 6-figure dollar mark next year, should current onchain metrics sustain and improve from current levels. As incoming President Trump prepares to take over the keys to the White House, I expect some more upward pressure in Bitcoin’s price on the optimism for the incoming President. A Trump 2.0 should be generally favorable for Bitcoin and crypto currencies moving forward, and I expect the next 3-4 months to experience some further upside in Bitcoin as election promises fall into delivery mode.

42435190,vcdRFSInNZZ7jTkxATLRil,1731157200,The Unique Way the Solana Trading Ecosystem Is Making Bank,"Solana's on-chain trading ecosystem is generating surprisingly high revenues.  That's because of the network's unique architecture and the possibilities it affords traders.  As a sector in its own right, Solana trading-linked activity is the third most profitable financial category in crypto, behind stablecoins and layer 1s.  There's a lot of money to be made in providing infrastructure for Solana on-chain markets.  That's according to David Duong and David Han, head of institutional research and institutional research analyst at crypto exchange Coinbase, who made the case in a Friday report that, if one looks at Solana's on-chain trading ecosystem as a financial sector in its own right, it's the third-most-profitable category in crypto — right behind stablecoins and layer 1s.  ""Solana's trading-linked activity regularly accounts for 75-90% of [Solana] transaction fees, substantially higher than that of Ethereum and other networks like Base and Arbitrum,"" Duong told CoinDesk. ""While layer 2 solutions have also shown growth and innovation, they face different scalability challenges and user fragmentation issues compared to Solana,"" Duong added. ""Solana's approach, especially its fee dynamics and user activity patterns, remains distinct.""  Coinbase somewhat put its money where its mouth is this week, announcing cbBTC, which brings the ability to trade, lend and borrow bitcoin {{BTC}} on Solana — crucial functionality likely needed for decentralized finance, or DeFi, to take off in that ecosystem.  Read more: Coinbase Brings Bitcoin to Solana, Spurring High Hopes for DeFi Surge  By the numbers: Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC stablecoins have produced $93 million and $28 million in revenue, respectively, in the last seven days, according to DefiLlama data, while the Ethereum, Tron and Solana networks saw $19 million, $11 million and $9.6 million. Solana-based protocols and trading bots, meanwhile, are right behind. Trading bot platform Photon and memecoin powerhouse pump.fun have both generated over $6 million in the last seven days, exceeding Ethereum-based decentralized finance, or DeFi, heavyweights such as Maker, Lido or Aave in terms of revenue.  Most of this is thanks to memecoins — joke cryptocurrencies that don't pretend to have any utility and tend to be very volatile. Pump.fun, a Solana-based protocol that allows users to easily create new tokens, has made the network a central hub for memecoin trading activity. Over 3 million coins have been launched on pump.fun since the protocol went live in January 2024, Coinbase said.  That's where Telegram trading bots — which help users buy and sell memecoins even faster — step in. ""The magnitude of revenue generated by Telegram trading bots is surprising, even exceeding that of pump.fun,"" the Coinbase analysts wrote. The most profitable bots, like Photon, Bankbot and Trojan, are all exclusively based on Solana, the report noted. ""This suggests that a large number of traders on Solana are less sensitive to execution fees, perhaps due to the higher volatility (and also lower liquidity) of the underlying assets,"" the analysts wrote.  ""What we've also uncovered in our research is that Solana's fee spending generally peaks later in the day, coinciding with the U.S. West Coast hours, which suggests a distinct cohort of active users there,"" Duong told CoinDesk.  Tailoring an on-chain ecosystem to users  Solana builders are aware that the network's on-chain environment has produced unique dynamics — and some of them are trying to take advantage of that to the fullest. For example, Zeta Markets, a decentralized exchange, or DEX, that offers perpetual contracts, wants its users to be able to buy their memecoins and take on leverage without needing to use multiple wallets.  ""Traders are like, 'Why would I go trade on a centralized exchange [CEX]?' They have all their funds already on the Solana chain,"" Zeta Markets Founder Tristan Frizza told CoinDesk in an interview. ""If you already have your Phantom wallet with all your memecoins, then you might want to hedge it out using perpetual futures. That's like one click away [with DEXs].""  Ease of use is a massive draw, but it also implies listing risky coins that aren't yet present on any CEX, Frizza said. Not to mention the ability to use Solana tokens as collateral for the perps positions, instead of simply stablecoins. ""No one wants to be holding stables in a bull market,"" Frizza said. ""They just want to take whatever's in their wallet and chuck this into their margin account.""  All of this ends up showing up in the data. The convenience of trading on Solana DEXs has led these protocols' volumes to deviate from Coinbase's — even as Ethereum DEX volumes have become more correlated.  ""This suggests that the trading activity on Solana is relatively decoupled from CEX activity and appears to be forming its own distinct ecosystem,"" the Coinbase report said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | SOL | TRADING,Tom Carreras,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/11/09/the-unique-way-the-solana-trading-ecosystem-is-making-bank,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/677999a6aa0f0e300eeaed71fdeebfba21ed830d-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Game theory illustrates how institutional and national adoption of BTC could unfold, with MSTR's success pressuring other companies to consider BTC investments. Trump's pro-BTC stance and Republican majority are expected to drive favorable BTC policies, potentially including a national BTC reserve, influencing global BTC adoption. We reiterate our BUY ratings on BTC and MSTR, anticipating accelerated institutional adoption and higher BTC prices driven by FOMO dynamics and supportive U.S. policies. Introduction On October 21st, we initiated coverage on MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) with a BUY rating. In that article, we emphasized Michael Saylor's strong convictions and long-term vision characterized by MSTR’s Bitcoin (BTC-USD) strategy. In this article, we also mentioned key risks and potential growth drivers for the stock. On September 11 th we also initiated on BTC with a BUY rating, highlighting that brighter days could be on the horizon. For our readers who haven't checked our initiations yet, we encourage you to check them out. Since our initiations, MSTR has outperformed S&P 500 ( SP500 ) by 21.6%. Seeking Alpha On its side, BTC has outperformed the index by 23.06%. Seeking Alpha In this article, we’ll discuss MSTR and BTC potential with a focus on the accelerating momentum behind these two assets, especially following Trump’s victory in the U.S. election. First, we’ll dive into MSTR’s recent earnings. Then, we’ll explore the concept of ""game theory"" to illustrate how mass adoption could unfold, initially among institutions and potentially among nations. We'll begin by examining how MSTR, under Michael Saylor’s leadership, is challenging many investors and corporations, creating momentum that could spark a wave of institutional BTC adoption. Finally, we’ll discuss Trump and the Republican stance on BTC and explore how this could impact BTC adoption at an international level. MSTR Q3 Earnings - Michael Saylor's 42 Strategy During Q3 , MSTR acquired an additional 25,889 BTC for $1.6 billion at an average price of $60 839. As we write, this represents already a 25% unrealized profit on that portion. Consistent with its strategy, the firm raised $1.1 billion in equity and $1 billion through convertible notes due in 2028. It also repaid $500 million in senior notes maturing in 2028. The group now holds $18 billion in BTC and shows no signs of slowing down as it announced its “42 Strategy”, a plan to acquire $42 billion of BTC by 2025 through $21 billion in equity and $21 billion in debt. Here’s the breakdown and timeline of this strategy: Company Presentation In our initiation, we highlighted two key metrics that deserved close attention: BTC count relative to the increase in share count. This ratio is essential, as it shows whether shareholders are gaining more BTC per share, despite share dilution. Since the beginning of the year, even with a +13.2% increase in share count, shareholders have seen their BTC holdings per share rise by 33.3%. Adjusted for dilution, this results in what is called a “BTC Yield” of 17.8%, which we find particularly impressive. Company Presentation During the earnings call, management also set BTC yield targets for 2025-2027, aiming for a range of 6-10%, which is lower than the historical BTC yield. This indicates in our view a rather cautious approach. A lower BTC yield could reflect a shift from aggressive BTC acquisition to a more stable pace. It could also suggest more dilution than previously seen. We consider that even a lower BTC yield benefits to shareholders as long as it remains above the share dilution rate. Management also highlighted the strong performance of the firm since adopting the BTC strategy in which very few believed. MSTR success has proven critics wrong. Company Presentation Since implementing this strategy, MSTR has been outperforming every company in the S&P 500. In that sense, there’s good reason for Michael Saylor to be proud. This success is creating a seism in the financial world and beyond. More and more important players are starting to consider the possibility of integrating BTC into their own strategies. Why this sudden shift in behavior? Why are executives and even politicians who were once hostile to BTC now beginning to shift their positions and question their previous views? To understand this major change, we wanted to dive with you into the concept of “game theory”. Understanding Game Theory Game Theory is a framework for understanding the relationships between players, aiming to explain their decisions and choices based on their interactions and circumstances. Developed by mathematician John von Neumann and economist Oskar Morgenstern in the 1940s, this concept studies optimal decision-making, trying to anticipate the possible choices an actor might make and ultimately identifying the best decision they can take. Let’s illustrate this with a simple example. The Prisoner’s Dilemma Mario and Toad have been captured by Bowser, accused of trying to rescue Princess Peach from Bowser’s Castle! They’re now being interrogated separately. Author Here are the 4 possible outcomes: Both plead not guilty - They each receive a 3-year sentence. Mario pleads guilty while Toad pleads not guilty - Mario receives the minimum sentence, while Toad receives the maximum. Both plead guilty - They both get a 5-year sentence. Toad pleads guilty while Mario pleads not guilty - Toad receives the minimum sentence, while Mario receives the maximum. Here pleading guilty is the best option if the other pleads not guilty. However, if both plead guilty, they’ll still face a significant sentence, though it will be less severe than if one pleads guilty while the other doesn't. This simple example highlights the importance of understanding the other’s actions to make the best possible decision in any given situation. Bitcoin and Corporations Adoption We believe that the game theory applies particularly well to what is currently happening to the institutional sphere while BTC perspectives are shifting. Since the beginning of MSTR's BTC strategy, an increasing number of companies have started to consider BTC as a potential way to diversify their treasury. As of today, 29 listed companies hold BTC, representing 1.73% of the total BTC supply. Coingecko, Author Since MSTR’s initial adoption in 2020, several other companies have taken this step toward BTC. Here, we only mention those that currently hold crypto. Some, like Reddit ( RDDT ) included BTC in their treasury but decided recently to sell them. There is no doubt that MSTR holds the majority of BTC held by institutions. We also acknowledge that many companies holding BTC are operating in the BTC mining industry, but adoption is growing. In the past, BTC wasn’t even considered, it was either ignored or mocked. Today, we are convinced that this perception is changing. MicroStrategy vs Microsoft - Bitcoin Dilemma In December 2024, Microsoft shareholders will vote on whether the company should explore investing a portion of its cash reserves in BTC, a proposal made by the National Center for Public Policy Research ((NCPPR)). You can find below NCCPPR's statement: CoinTelegraph It’s worth noting that MSFT’s board is advising shareholders to vote against this proposal. We believe it is unlikely that this proposal will be adopted, at least, not yet. Here again, we consider this case as a perfect example of game theory. Now that many investors have observed companies like MSTR diversifying their holdings with successful results, more and more investors especially the one holding MSFT shares are questioning why companies with massive cash reserves, don’t invest in scarce assets like BTC to counter cash depreciation. In our view, the simple fact that this question is being asked now, when just a few years ago, anyone asking it might have been considered as foolish, signals a massive change in perspective. For context, the Magnificent Seven alone hold more than $300 billion in cash. According to Investors , as of the end of 2023, 13 S&P companies collectively held over $1 trillion in cash. In total, S&P companies are holding approximately $2.5 trillion in cash, almost double BTC’s total market capitalization. Investors Even a small allocation of this cash could be a game changer for BTC, and we expect such moves to happen in the near term. We believe that even a slight allocation from S&P companies could have a significant impact on BTC’s trajectory and trigger a domino effect. Returning to our game theory scenario, here’s how it could play out: Author Same way of interpretation than we did before with our friends Mario and Toad 4 possible outcomes: Both buy BTC - Both companies see high gains and are viewed as innovators. MSTR Buys, MSFT Ignores - MSTR benefits from BTC's success, while MSFT maintains stability but misses potential BTC gains, potentially appearing behind the curve. MSFT Buys, MSTR Ignores – MSFT could gain as a “catch-up” adopter if BTC appreciates, whereas MSTR might stabilize or lose value due to investors losing faith in the firm’s strategy. Both Ignore BTC - Both companies keep cash or invest in traditional assets that are sensitive to inflation, leading to value erosion over time. In MSFT’s case, the company may face additional pressure, as highlighted in a Cointelegraph article where Ethan Peck, deputy director of NCPPR’s stated: Should Microsoft publicly and explicitly determine in this assessment (undoubtedly based on shaky and biased reasoning) that it’s not in the best interest of Microsoft shareholders to purchase any BTC, and then BTC proceeds to increase in value (as it likely will), there may be grounds for shareholders to sue the Company. As more companies embrace BTC, we believe investors holding shares in companies that resist may become frustrated, watching BTC-friendly companies outperform. We believe this will increase pressure on corporate to potentially consider BTC thus supporting adoption. U.S.A. - Driving Bitcoin’s New World Order Let’s shift our focus from corporations to nations, specifically the U.S. and China. Crypto played a significant role in this recent election, frequently mentioned by both candidates, Trump and Harris. However, Trump emerged as the most crypto-friendly, as reflected by BTC’s price action on the day of the results. That day, BTC surged by 9% and reached a new all-time high of $76 000. We believe Trump’s victory will be a game-changer for BTC adoption in the U.S., paving the way for mass adoption worldwide. During his campaign, he promised to support the U.S. BTC mining industry and DeFi, to replace Gary Gensler with a more open-minded SEC chairman, and most notably, to create a strategic BTC reserve for the U.S. We are confident these promises will be respected as Republicans not only secured the presidency but also gained a majority in the Senate and led the House of Representatives. This should grant them the power to propose and pass the laws they consider as appropriated. Although the election is recent, momentum is already building and strengthening. In July 2024, Senator Cynthia Lummis, known for her pro-crypto positions, proposed a bill for the U.S. to acquire 200,000 BTC annually for the 5 upcoming years . If applied, this would result in a strategic reserve of 1 million BTC or 4.7% of the supply. LummisSenate.gov We don’t know if this whole plan will be implemented or if it will be modified but we believe that initiatives of this kind are likely to be adopted under the Trump administration. If so, we are convinced this initiative would provide strong support for BTC's price. If adopted at the state level, we also believe that game theory could enter in action at a totally different scale. In that specific scenario, we anticipate that many countries will reconsider their stance on BTC, starting with China, considering the competition between these two super-powers. However, remember that in September 2021, China banned cryptocurrency transactions, including BTC. Recently, unofficial sources have suggested that China might reconsider this decision . We currently find it unlikely, given China’s consistent opposition to this asset class. If this position were to shift, we believe that game theory would once again play a crucial role in influencing such a decision driving way higher BTC price and of course MSTR. Author Conclusion We remain bullish about BTC and MSTR. We have the conviction that Michael Saylor's vision and bold BTC strategy has set off a domino effect, making MSTR a frontrunner and pressuring other companies to consider BTC as a key diversification asset. As more companies and frustrated investors observe MSTR’s success, they’re increasingly facing the decisions of whether to follow or risk being left behind. We believe this FOMO dynamic could accelerate BTC’s institutional adoption and drive prices way higher. Strengthening our optimism, we think the recent President Trump election and the Republican majority will support BTC. This administration should push forward pro-BTC policies, potentially including a national BTC reserve and a favorable regulatory framework. If adopted, we are convinced the U.S.'s stance will influence other countries. A shift in U.S. policy could trigger reassessment elsewhere in the world, supporting further BTC price. Considering all these elements, we reiterate our BUY ratings on BTC and MSTR.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4735428-how-game-theory-and-a-pro-crypto-shift-could-spark-global-bitcoin-adoption-reaffirming-buy-rating-on-btc-and-mstr?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/35987896.jpeg

Here’s whether this has been enough for a top in the past. Bitcoin Profitability Index Is Currently Sitting Around 221% In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has discussed about the latest trend in the Bitcoin Average Profitability Index. The “Average Profitability Index” is an indicator for BTC that compares the asset’s spot value with its realized price. The “realized price” here refers to a measure of the cost basis or acquisition value of the average investor in the Bitcoin market. This metric’s value is determined using on-chain data, with the last price at which each coin in circulation was transacted on the blockchain being taken as its current cost basis. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Enters Danger Zone: Investors Now Extremely Greedy When the Average Profitability Index is greater than 100%, it means the spot price of the cryptocurrency is currently higher than its realized price. Such a trend suggests the average investor is holding a net amount of profit. On the other hand, the indicator being under this threshold implies the BTC market as a whole is carrying coins at a net unrealized loss. Naturally, the index being exactly equal to 100% indicates the holders as a whole are just breaking-even on their investment. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Average Profitability Index over the past decade: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin Average Profitability Index has registered a notable increase recently as the cryptocurrency’s run to the new all-time high (ATH) price has occurred. The indicator has now reached a value of around 221%, which suggests the investors are in a significant amount of gains. More particularly, the BTC addresses as a whole are in a net profit of 121%. Generally, the higher the profits of the holders get, the more likely they become to fall to the allure of profit-taking. The current Average Profitability Index level is high, but it’s uncertain if it’s high enough for a mass selloff to become a risk. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Be Ready For ‘Phase 2’ Of This Historical Bull Pattern In the chart, the analyst has marked how high the metric went at the time of the tops of the previous bull runs. It would appear that 2017 peaked at 460%, while 2021 at 395%. So far in the current cycle, the highest that the index has gone was 272%, which happened during the top back in March of this year. Given the fact that the indicator is yet to hit this level, let alone the peaks from the last cycles, it’s possible that Bitcoin still has sufficient room to run, before a top becomes probable. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $76,200, up more than 9% over the past week.

Wang’s heavy debts, which stemmed from failed cryptocurrency investments , led him down the path of espionage, for which he received payments in cryptocurrency worth over a million yuan. Reports from China’s National Security Ministry condemn Wang’s actions but do not blame the crypto community . The focus is largely on Wang’s own mistakes, marking his case as a personal failing rather than a broader indictment of the crypto industry. According to the Ministry of National Security in Anping Province, Wang was found guilty of trading confidential state information with foreign intelligence. His motivation came from large financial losses in crypto trading, and he was compensated in virtual currency for his betrayal. Authorities accuse him of sharing top-secret information and accepting crypto payments in return. China’s official statements refrained from naming any specific foreign government, although past reports suggested MI6, the British intelligence agency, had recruited a Chinese spy named Wang Moumou. This resemblance has led many to connect the two incidents. This isn’t the first case of crypto involvement in espionage. Previous incidents include North Korean hackers financing espionage with crypto and a U.S. nuclear engineer who attempted to sell secrets for crypto, only to be caught in an FBI sting. However, while crypto played a role in Wang’s crimes , Chinese authorities have been cautious about casting the blame on cryptocurrency itself. Interestingly, China has recently shown signs of opening up to blockchain. At the BRICS Summit, China supported creating a new global payments platform based on blockchain. It has also continued to expand its digital yuan, incorporating it into local payment systems. These moves have sparked hope that China’s stance on crypto may evolve. Despite Wang’s actions, China’s reaction has focused on his individual faults rather than painting crypto as a corrupting influence. While this incident isn’t ideal for crypto's image, China’s measured response suggests it may still be keeping options open in its approach to digital currency.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | TRADING | OTHER,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/chinese-official-gets-life-sentence-for-selling-secrets-over-crypto-debt,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/35987186.jpeg

At present, the cryptocurrency is trading at $76,587, reflecting a modest 0.9% dip from its peak while still marking a 1.7% daily increase. This stability signals resilience and has fuelled speculation regarding Bitcoin’s next price move. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Current Price Action Sets Stage For 30% Rally, Says Crypto Analyst Bitcoin Miners Hold Back On Selling, Why? As Bitcoin currently trades above $76,000, a CryptoQuant analyst identified as theKriptolik has pointed out a notable trend among Bitcoin miners. According to theKriptolik, miners are refraining from selling their BTC holdings, even with the asset trading near its ATH, as they believe the current valuation remains undervalued. The analyst highlighted that miners typically transfer BTC to exchanges and sell it when prices approach an ATH, partly to cover their operational expenses. However, this behaviour has not been observed recently, signifying a potential belief in further price gains. TheKriptolik elaborated on this behaviour by referencing miner activity on October 29, when a substantial inflow of BTC to exchanges occurred, resulting in a sale of the holdings with no corresponding outflows. This lack of recent exchange-bound transfers indicates miners’ confidence in Bitcoin’s ongoing upward momentum. Historically, miner behaviour has served as a key indicator of market sentiment, with sales often coinciding with market tops. Optimism Among Analysts And Technical Signals The positive sentiment among miners is mirrored by other market analysts, who have offered bullish forecasts for Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Javon Marks, a prominent crypto analyst, noted that Bitcoin’s ability to maintain a stronghold above a critical $67,559 level sets the stage for further upward movement. According to Marks, Bitcoin could experience a rally of over 51%, potentially pushing the price to $116,652. Marks emphasized that this movement could unfold at a faster pace than many market participants currently anticipate, driven by strong underlying market dynamics. Similarly, another CryptoQuant analyst, Mignolet, has provided an outlook that suggests the conditions for Bitcoin entering the second phase of its bull rally are falling into place. Mignolet explained that this transition involves changes in market participant behaviour, particularly among long-term holders (LTHs) and short-term holders (STHs). As LTH supply begins to be distributed, an influx of new liquidity and capital is critical to sustaining the rally’s momentum. According to Mignolet, the current market environment, characterized by increased liquidity and echoes of the 2017 bull cycle, supports the completion of Phase 2 of Bitcoin’s price surge. Conditions for entering Phase 2 are being completed “A key condition for moving into Phase 2 is an increase in STH supply, specifically through a surge in new capital. Currently, the market is experiencing abundant new liquidity.” – By @mignoletkr Link 👇… pic.twitter.com/gszfQFcn13 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) November 8, 2024 Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-nears-ath-as-miners-hold-back-on-selling-bullish-signals-flashing/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/35983100.jpeg

35990320,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=101024,1731144838,Here’s How Much 1 Cardano Will be Worth if ADA Market Cap Reaches $100B,"Cardano has the potential to retest its 2021 all-time peak if its market cap rises to claim the coveted $100 billion mark. The crypto market has embarked on an impressive run, with Cardano being one of the biggest beneficiaries after months of underperformance. Notably, the latest market-wide upsurge came on the back of Bitcoin’s push to new peaks following Donald Trump’s win in the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election.Despite Cardano’s bearish performance from March to October, market analysts remained confident in the altcoin’s potential. For instance, most recently, market watcher Javon Marks predicted a potential Cardano rally to $8. Meanwhile, earlier in the month, another analyst, Madmaudo, argued that an ADA surge to the $3 level was long overdue. In addition, analyst Dan Gambardello projected a possible surge to $15. However, while pundits believe most of these targets are within reach, some argue that targets like $15 might not be feasible.Cardano Price if Its Market Cap Hits $100BThe major reason behind this skepticism is the resulting market cap from loftier price targets. For context, the $15 price level would bring Cardano’s valuation to $525 billion, much higher than Ethereum’s current market cap of $365 billion. This would make ADA the second-largest crypto asset, a tall feat.Notably, ADA’s peak market cap was $93 billion, a valuation it attained when it surpassed $3 during the 2021 bull run. However, at the current circulating supply of over 35 billion tokens, Cardano would trade at $2.77 if it reclaimed the $93 billion peak during this bull run. Meanwhile, if ADA ever surpassed this level to claim the much-coveted $100 billion market cap level, its price could knock at the previous ATH. Particularly, with a $100 billion market cap, Cardano would trade at $2.85. While this would represent an impressive 551% increase from current prices, ADA would still be 5% away from its 2021 peak of $3.1.ADA up 27% in November Notably, the likelihood of this recovery becomes clearer as the market progresses. Cardano has leveraged the latest uptrend to record an impressive 22% increase over the past seven days, making it the second-largest gainer among the top 20 assets within this timeframe, only behind Dogecoin (DOGE).Before now, ADA had performed poorly following the collapse from the $0.8104 yearly peak in March. Significantly, from March to October, Cardano collapsed 48%. Interestingly, ADA had regained most of this value, up 27.88% in November with the altcoin season still ahead. At a current market cap of $15.3 billion, Cardano has now re-entered the top 10 list of largest assets after falling out of this region in August when its market cap slumped to $11 billion.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/09/heres-how-much-1-cardano-will-be-worth-if-ada-market-cap-reaches-100b/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heres-how-much-1-cardano-will-be-worth-if-ada-market-cap-reaches-100b,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

35979023,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652243,1731144657,Bitcoin Could Be Ready For ‘Phase 2’ Of This Historical Bull Pattern,"On-chain data shows Bitcoin could currently be following a similar pattern as in a previous cycle in terms of this indicator. Bitcoin Could Now Be Entering Phase 2 Of The Bull Run In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst has pointed out how the recent trend in the Bitcoin long-term holder supply has been reminiscent to what was observed in the 2017 cycle. The long-term holders (LTHs) make up for one of the two main divisions of the BTC userbase done on the basis of holding time, with the other side being known as the short-term holders (STHs). The cutoff between these two cohorts is 155 days, with investors who bought inside this window being part of the STHs, while those holding since more than it falling in the LTHs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Enters Danger Zone: Investors Now Extremely Greedy Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell said coins at any point. Thus, the LTHs are considered to include the more resolute market participants. Below is a chart that shows the trend in the combined amount of supply held by the participants of the respective Bitcoin groups. As is visible in the graph, the Bitcoin LTH supply observed a sharp decline back during the rally of the first quarter of the year, suggesting that even these diamond hands couldn’t resist the temptation of profit-taking. Alongside this decrease in the LTH supply, the STH supply naturally went up, as whenever the LTHs transfer their tokens on the blockchain, they become part of the STH cohort instead. Recently, the LTH supply had reversed this drawdown from earlier in the year, but with the latest rally to the new all-time high (ATH), the metric has again switched directions. In the chart, the quant has highlighted how a similar pattern was also witnessed back during the 2017 cycle; a first phase of distribution from the LTHs was followed by accumulation, which then led to a second phase of distribution. Related Reading: Dogecoin Descending Triangle Could Hint At Next Destination For DOGE It’s possible that the latest turnaround in the LTH supply is the start of the phase 2 distribution for the current cycle, where fresh capital flows in to take coins off the hands of the HODLers. The LTH supply isn’t the only metric that’s showing a trend that matches that of the previous cycle. As the chart shared by the analyst shows, the Bitcoin Binary CDD is also forming an interesting pattern. The Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) basically tells us about whether the HODLers are selling less or more than the historical average. From the graph, it’s apparent that the 152-day moving average (MA) of this metric may be showing a second breakout similar to the one that led into the 2021 bull run.

The crypto industry has recently faced hostile regulatory clampdowns, especially under the incumbent SEC chair, Gary Gensler. As a result, the sector heavily backed a pro-crypto president, Donald Trump, who promised to do away with the Gensler on his first day in office.Following Trump’s victory, discussions on who would replace Gesler have gained momentum. The Crypto Basic reported that Trump’s transition team is courting Robinhood’s CLO Dan Gallagher and a few other lawyers to replace the US SEC chair.Meanwhile, FOX Business journalist Eleanor Terrett has provided a soothing update for crypto enthusiasts on the selection process for the next SEC boss. She revealed that the Trump transition team has its eyes only on candidates that are pro-crypto.Pro-Crypto: A Crucial Criteria for the Next SEC ChairIn a Friday tweet , Terrett revealed that she contacted a source close to Trump’s transition team to discuss the names making the rounds as Gensler’s successor. The journalist also noted that she inquired if the team considered the candidate’s perception of cryptocurrency in the selection process.Notably, Terrett stated that she got an elating response from her anonymous source for the crypto community. She mentioned that the Trump transition team confirmed that the next SEC chair would be one who believes in and supports the nascent technology.Meanwhile, the response aligns with Trump’s promises to the sector. During his campaign days, he unequivocally insisted that he supports cryptocurrencies and intends to foster their growth through his policies.Crypto Sector Brace Up for Regulatory ClarityAmid the positive development, the US crypto sector seems headed for regulatory clarity after uncertainties have prevailed in recent years. Notably, the industry’s leaders have bemoaned that Gensler imposed unclear laws and handled the growing sector like a tyrant.Following Trump’s electoral conquest, Coinbase’s CLO Paul Grewal has urged the SEC to refine its dealings with the crypto industry. He encouraged the Wall Street regulator to pursue interaction with exchanges over litigation, as observed in the over 100 lawsuits brought against them under Gensler.The imminent change in the SEC hierarchy could also bring an end to Ripple’s years-long legal battle with the regulator.

Hopes for regulatory relief under the Trump presidency and Fed rate cuts galvanize demand for ETH.  When a beleaguered asset is met with a burst of good news, it can unleash powerful bullish momentum, often outshining the broader market. Ethereum's native token, Ether (ETH), is experiencing this phenomenon following pro-crypto Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. election and the Fed rate cut earlier this week.  ETH, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, surged past $3,000 on Saturday, reaching the highest since Aug. 2, according to CoinDesk data. Prices have risen 23.39% this week, the biggest gain since May, outperforming BTC's 11.2% gain by a significant margin. The total crypto market capitalization has increased by 13.5% to $2.5 trillion.  ETH's market-beating surge could be attributed to two factors. First, there is hope that the Trump administration will relax regulatory barriers for the digital assets industry, potentially fostering growth in decentralized finance, a sector dominated by Ethereum.  Another equally important factor is the Fed rate cut cycle, which is restoring ether's appeal as an internet bond, offering a fixed-income return through staking rewards.  On Thursday, the Fed reduced the benchmark borrowing cost by 25 basis points to a range of 4.5%-4.75%, having delivered an outsized 50 bps cut in September. The rate reduction has narrowed the so-called Fed-ether yield differential in favor of ETH.  The way ether options listed on Deribit are currently priced suggests the ETH rally is expected to continue. The call-put skew is positive across time frames, indicating a relative richness of call options offering asymmetric upside potential to the buyer.  Inflows into the spot ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have picked up as well. On Friday, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) registered an inflow of nearly $60 million, the highest in three months, according to Farside Investors.  Note that ETH is still well below its 2021 peak of $4,868, while BTC is trading at record highs above $75,000.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/09/ether-blows-past-3k-builds-bullish-momentum-after-trumps-election-win-and-fed-rate-cut,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9e2d377dd1a4c12c4238c0944e683009874d1bfd-2880x1800.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has jumped 21.9% in the past three days, reigniting investors’ bullish sentiment for the crypto and ETH-based investment products. Related Reading: Ethereum L2 Project Spark Launches On-Chain Order Book On Fuel Network To Enhance Trading Ethereum ETFs See Third Best-performing Day Amid ETH’s price rally, spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have recorded their best-performing day in 13 weeks. Launched in late July, ETH ETFs have seen a shaky performance in the past few months. The crypto investment products surpassed experts’ expectations during its first two days. However, ETH ETFs recorded massive outflows amid Q3 market retraces. Ethereum-based products saw their second-largest single-day inflow since launch during the early August correction. As the market recovered from the crash, Ethereum ETFs registered $98.4 million in positive net flows, led by Blackrock’s ETHA. Since then, the crypto products have struggled to break past the $20 million mark, only registering inflows above that range five times in three months. ETH’s current rally has seemingly improved sentiment around the cryptocurrency and the investment products based on it, as it has recorded a notable performance during the last two days. Ethereum ETFs recorded their best-performing day in six weeks, seeing $52.3 million in inflows on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the investment products saw their third-largest single-day performance on Thursday and their best day since August 6, with $79.7 million in inflows. ETH Rallies 16%, Is $3,500 Next? Ethereum has seen a massive 16.6% surge in the last seven days, jumping from the $2,500 support zone to the $2,900 mark lost mid-Q3. The “King of Altcoins” lost the $3,000 support zone in early August, recording a 23% correction during the market retraces. The cryptocurrency struggled to break past the crucial $2,800 resistance level, being rejected from this level for the past three months. However, Republican candidate Donald Trump’s victory in the Thursday presidential elections has given the whole crypto market a renewed push toward the second leg of the bull run. In the last three days, the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), has entered price discovery mode, setting its latest all-time high (ATH) at $76,800 on Thursday. Meanwhile, Ethereum saw its price move from the $2,400 range to near the long-awaited $3,000 resistance. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital noted that ETH’s recent performance filled its GME gap, which formed in early August. The gap saw ETH’s price go from $3,000 to $2,700 before crashing on August 5.

Moreover, reclaiming the $2,900 resistance would “set ETH up for a move to $3,500 over time,” which could further propel Ethereum’s rally toward its yearly high above $4,000. As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,925, a 4.2% increase in the last 24 hours.

35990317,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=101012,1731138652,$0.01 Technically Possible for Shiba Inu with $589T Market Cap — Here’s Only Way SHIB Can Reach It with Lower Valuation,"This article highlights how Shiba Inu could reach the coveted $0.01 price target at a lower valuation than the required $589 trillion market cap. The potential of Shiba Inu’s surge to the $0.01 target has been a major dream for many SHIB holders. Many investors are already considering how to go on early retirement if Shiba Inu ever achieves this milestone. However, Shiba Inu is currently trading far below the $0.01 target, which requires the token to surge tremendously to reach one cent. Currently, Shiba Inu is changing hands at $0.00001906, down 0.09% over the past 24 hours. This suggests that Shiba Inu must surge 52,365% from the current price to reach the $0.01 target. If Shiba Inu hits the $0.01 target, a portfolio of 52.5 million SHIB, which costs about $1,000 today, would be worth $525,000. Market Cap Required For Shiba Inu Surge to $0.01 Given Shiba Inu’s hefty supply of 589.26 trillion tokens, Shiba Inu requires a market cap of $5.89 trillion to reach the one-cent goal. This valuation is more than twice the global crypto market cap, which currently stands at $2.61 trillion. At the moment, Shiba Inu is valued at $11.21 billion and ranks as the 13th-biggest cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap. Therefore, Shiba Inu’s market cap must surge 52,365% to reach the projected valuation of $5.89 trillion. Based on the hefty growth demand and Shiba Inu supply, many analysts think the $0.01 target will never be achieved. Only Way Shiba Inu Can Hit $0.01 with a Lower Valuation Shiba Inu’s hefty supply poses a significant challenge to SHIB’s dream of hitting the $0.01 target. The current supply of 589.26 trillion SHIB requires Shiba Inu to surge 52,365% to claim the $0.01 target. Hence, Shiba Inu could only hit the $0.01 target at a lower valuation through aggressive burns. This process requires users to send SHIB to the official dead wallet, potentially reducing its supply and driving its price. Shiba Inu, which launched with a supply of 1 quadrillion tokens, has witnessed the incineration of 410,737,173,158,335 (410.73 trillion) SHIB. While this effort is commendable, there is still a need for large-scale burns. This can be achieved through several community initiatives, ecosystem developments, and potential collaborations with top projects. Interestingly, Shiba Inu community members are also proposing an initiative that could see Ethereum integrate SHIB as a gas token alongside ETH. They suggested that the tokens accumulated via this initiative would be automatically burned to reduce SHIB’s supply and boost its price drastically. Meanwhile, the team behind the Shiba Inu ecosystem is also committed to enhancing burns via Shibarium. Notably, the L2 blockchain is designed to burn SHIB using some of its fees. Since its launch last year, Shibarium has burned over 55 billion SHIB, with more tokens expected to burn amid a spike in the network's transaction volume. As Shiba Inu experiences more large-scale burns, the canine-themed token would require a lower valuation instead of the $5.89 trillion market cap to hit the $0.01 target.",NEGATIVE,ETH | SHIB,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/09/0-01-technically-possible-for-shiba-inu-with-589t-market-cap-heres-only-way-shib-can-reach-it-with-lower-valuation/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=0-01-technically-possible-for-shiba-inu-with-589t-market-cap-heres-only-way-shib-can-reach-it-with-lower-valuation,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
35990315,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=101010,1731138453,Pundit Says Anyone Not Leading You to XRP is Misleading You,"Crypto commentator Julius Rose has boldly asserted his strong belief in XRP, suggesting that anyone in the crypto market not guiding others toward XRP is likely misleading them. Rose shared this sentiment in a post on X on Friday, coinciding with XRP’s surge to a five-week high of $0.57 . As of press time, XRP is trading at $0.5521, up 7.6% over the past week.His statement that anyone not leading others to XRP is misleading them underscores his confidence in the asset’s long-term potential despite XRP's relatively underwhelming performance in recent years. While XRP has been a laggard compared to other cryptocurrencies, Rose’s perspective offers optimism for long-term holders, especially as some in the XRP community express frustration with the asset's recent price action.XRP Price Action in Recent TimesXRP’s weekly gain of 7.6% is modest compared to rivals like Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH), both of which have posted impressive weekly gains of over 21%. On a monthly basis, SOL and ETH have risen by 50% and 30%, respectively, while XRP has increased by just 3%.When looking at year-to-date performance, XRP is down by 10%, whereas Solana has surged by 97%, and Binance Coin (BNB) has gained 101% in the same period. This disparity has led to frustration among XRP holders, with critics using the underperformance to argue that XRP has limited potential in the current bull market.Ripple CEO Optimistic About XRP’s FutureDespite these challenges, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has recently expressed optimism about XRP’s future. He believes regulatory changes under a potential Donald Trump administration could help XRP regain momentum. Garlinghouse criticized the U.S. SEC's lawsuit against Ripple, which has hindered XRP's growth. He believes the incoming Trump administration's crypto-friendly stance—especially Trump's plan to replace SEC Chair Gary Gensler—could remove these obstacles. Garlinghouse reflected on XRP’s past highs and expressed confidence that the asset could regain prominence in the market. The XRP community is also hopeful, with many seeing 2025 as a potential turning point for the digital asset.A Critical Look at Julius Rose’s OptimismIt is worth noting that Julius Rose’s recent statement that anyone not leading people toward XRP is ""misleading"" them may be somewhat sarcastic. Rose has a history of criticizing XRP. Just two days ago, he argued that XRP would not reach a new all-time high in 2024, telling optimistic holders, ""Sorry."" In a more recent post, he even suggested the possibility that XRP might not hit a new all-time high in 2025, either.https://twitter.com/mrjuliusrose/status/1855059393437393285",POSITIVE,ETH | SOL | XRP,ETH | MARKET | SOL | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/09/pundit-says-anyone-not-leading-you-to-xrp-is-misleading-you/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pundit-says-anyone-not-leading-you-to-xrp-is-misleading-you,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Bitcoin’s upthrust frenzy has attracted global interest, with investors looking to leverage the premier asset’s growing relevance. Following its persistent break to new highs, Bitcoin is one of the most talked-about investment tools at the moment.Meanwhile, speculation has peaked recently, with several market experts increasingly discussing Bitcoin’s price outlook in the near future. For instance, Fundstrat’s CIO predicted that Bitcoin would trade at six figures before the end of the year.Van Eck CEO Gives Bitcoin Price OutlookAmidst the growing interest, CNBC reached out to leading asset manager Van Eck’s CEO, Jan Van Eck, for his input on Bitcoin’s near-term price expectation. In an interview on Friday, Van Eck speculated that Bitcoin will ultimately surge to $300,000.The CEO based his “reasonable, base assumption” on the pioneering cryptocurrency attaining half of gold’s market cap . He noted that Bitcoin is digital gold and would at least reach half of all the precious metal's valuation.Notably, Van Eck stressed that this was conservative, noting a Bitcoin maximalist would have given a more ambitious price outlook. He said it was a base call for Bitcoin, insinuating the asset could outperform his $300,000 speculation.Furthermore, Van Eck stated that one of Bitcoin’s biggest wins this year is the pent-up demand from individual and institutional investors for the US spot exchange-traded funds. The glaring traction towards Bitcoin products was seen in Thursday's staggering single-day inflow of $1.37 billion .The CEO added that Bitcoin’s growing relevance, as seen in the just concluded elections, was also a huge catalyst for the sector’s growth. Concerning indicators of this growing traction, he pinpointed Trump’s presence at the Bitcoin conference in Nashville earlier in the year and how digital assets became a talking point in the Ohio Senate race.Van Eck Says Now is a Good Entrypoint for EthereumVan Eck digressed slightly to discuss other alternative plays to Bitcoin. He mentioned assets like Coinbase’s COIN and Ethereum but noted that the latter is a good buy for “those who understand its business proposition.”The VanEck CEO asserted that stablecoins would take over the global payment system, and Ethereum would benefit largely from that. He further insisted that despite recent price performance, Ethereum will grow extensively in the near term.Van Eck noted that Ethereum has recently been a contrarian play . However, considering its potential, he stated that now is the best time to buy into the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.Meanwhile, Ethereum broke past the $3,000 price mark on Saturday, trading at $3,037 at press time.

The crypto bull market is gaining momentum as Bitcoin continues to set new all-time highs. For the past five days, fresh records have been made every day, fueling the rise of altcoins like Shiba Inu.In the last 24 hours, the global crypto market cap reached $2.62 trillion, up 4.6%, meaning $120.8 billion in fresh capital entered the market. This surge coincided with Bitcoin's new peak at $77,200 last night.While Bitcoin has largely dominated the spotlight in this bull market, altcoins like Shiba Inu are gradually catching up. Shiba Inu hit an intraday high of $0.00001931, marking an 8% gain over the past week.Crypto Market Projected to Hit $10 TrillionWith the global crypto market cap now above $2.61 trillion, notable analysts are issuing bold predictions about the future of the market and the potential for top altcoins like Shiba Inu.Market commentator HorBull, in a post on X, emphasized that the crypto market has a long way to go before reaching his projected $10 trillion market cap. According to him, a $10 trillion global crypto cap is attainable during this bull cycle.Notably, a market cap of $10 trillion would likely see Bitcoin's valuation at around $5 trillion, as it typically commands over 50% of the total market. In this scenario, Bitcoin's price would likely approach $250,000. Meanwhile, this optimistic scenario will give the altcoin market a $5 trillion valuation. For context, the altcoin market is currently worth around $1.2 trillion. This suggests HorBull expects about $3.8 trillion to flow into the altcoin market over the next year as the bull cycle progresses. With this ambitious outlook, he highlighted the potential for Shiba Inu's price.Shiba Inu Price with a Global Crypto Cap of $10 TrillionAccording to HorBull, Shiba Inu could reach a price of $0.0002 in the event of a $10 trillion global market cap, which would mean Shiba Inu would ""remove a leading zero"" from its current price. At its current price of $0.00001903, Shiba Inu has a market cap of $11.21 billion.A price of $0.0002 would elevate Shiba Inu's market cap to approximately $118 billion. Many market experts, including Jake Gagain, have argued that Shiba Inu could surpass the $100 billion market cap during this cycle.Notably, for Shiba Inu to reach a price of $0.0002 from its current price, the asset would need to increase by 950%, or nearly 10x its current value.Other market watchers agree that Shiba Inu could hit $0.0002 by next year, given its explosive potential. Some have even suggested it could surpass that level during this bull cycle. Shiba Inu demonstrated this potential earlier this year when it soared by 370% in under two weeks during the first quarter.",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/09/expert-predicts-shiba-inu-price-if-total-market-cap-hits-10t/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=expert-predicts-shiba-inu-price-if-total-market-cap-hits-10t,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

XRP has joined the crypto market rally, recently reaching $0.5740, up 11% from yesterday’s price of $0.514. Bitcoin’s record-breaking surge has provided a broader market boost, and XRP is capitalizing on this momentum to drive its price higher. For many investors, this is an encouraging indicator that the altcoin may ultimately recapture its upper price points. Related Reading: Solana Rockets Past BNB To Claim Coveted 4th Spot In Crypto Ranks However, market momentum is not the only factor at play here. Analyst CoinsKid, noted for his enormous following on social media site X, recently posted an analysis indicating that the XRP rise may have more potential to develop. Using a two-year weekly chart, CoinsKid found significant resistance and support levels, implying that it could break through to new highs. Is #xrp on its ways to $4? a new all-time high for this #crypto! Hold the green line and take out the orange line and a run to the upper red line would not surprise me. Best of luck CKC 🙌 pic.twitter.com/NYBl2igF9g — CoinsKid (@Coins_Kid) November 6, 2024 Technical Points To Watch CoinsKid’s chart shows three big XRP resistance points: $0.94, $1.50, and $2.50. These levels are critical because they have historically served as ceilings for XRP. For example, in July, the coin peaked at $0.94 before falling back, just after a court ruling declared the asset not a security. This was a major milestone, but the excitement faded when the price failed to remain above this level. The analyst believes that XRP will break through these resistance points without needing to retest the lower support level of $0.3798. If the altcoin continues on its current track, it might eventually reach a top of about $4, according to CoinsKid. For investors, this may mean significant profit, particularly if the market maintains its present bullish tone. Regulatory Hope Boosts Optimism The legal environment in the US is another thing that is making people feel good about XRP. Recent reports have it that when President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January 2025, he will replace Gary Gensler as Chairman of the SEC. Many in the crypto space are keeping a close interest on this theory, especially from XRP enthusiasts who feel that Gensler’s exit will speak well for a more positive perspective towards the altcoin and cryptos. The Trump campaign to reorganize the SEC has added to this optimism. Many think that removal of Gensler would give XRP ample freedom to operate without many legal barriers. Such a shift in the regulatory landscape could well be one big win for XRP, taking the price up. Related Reading: Binance Coin Breaks $600! Is There More Upside Ahead For BNB? Future Price Predictions Look Bright Looking forward, the price forecast for XRP also seems very promising. The analysts predict a 14% increase in the next three months, and its potential growth in six months is much higher, at 160%. A one-year prognosis would mean that the asset could get returns of over 100%. This makes the $4 goal not out of reach, given that Bitcoin has broken new grounds and the fundamentals of XRP are high. Finally, a combination of technical resiliency, market momentum, and future regulatory reforms might propel XRP to previously uncharted territory. For XRP holders, this might be an exciting trip to what many believe would be a new all-time high.

Market tracking platform Whale Alert first spotlighted the transactions, confirming that exactly 1,675,841,120,949 (1.675 trillion) SHIB tokens moved from three separate whale addresses to a central Coinbase wallet yesterday. Details of the Shiba Inu Movements For context, the Shiba Inu market saw the transfer of 558,613,706,983 (558 billion) SHIB tokens from 0x0…9f8 , an unknown whale address, to Coinbase 10 yesterday at 16:46 UTC. At the time, the tokens were worth $10.418 million.However, at the exact time of this transfer, two more unknown whale addresses, particularly 0x8…fa5 and 0xf…f62 , sent the exact same amount to the same Coinbase address. Whale Alert on X Whale Alert on X This brought the total cumulative assets to 1.675 trillion Shiba Inu tokens, all worth $31.254 million. To put things into perspective, the total tokens moved through these three transactions account for nearly 0.3% of Shiba Inu’s circulating supply .Due to the magnitude of the transactions, concerns have emerged among investors. These apprehensions stem from the fact that movements to exchanges typically lead to selloffs, and the sale of 0.3% of SHIB’s circulating supply could dampen its current growth trajectory.Here’s What We KnowNonetheless, an investigation from The Crypto Basic suggests that there is no cause for alarm. A scrutiny of the three addresses show that they might actually belong to Coinbase . This would confirm that the exchange used these transactions to internally shuffle its SHIB holdings.All three whale addresses started receiving the SHIB tokens from September 2021, during the previous bull run.

In a startling development, the Ripple CEO joined BBC, a top UK media outlet, to discuss XRP for the first time on the platform. Before the interview commenced, the BBC interviewer provided insights into XRP-related developments, ranging from its prospect for a spot ETF and involvement in the SEC v. Ripple lawsuit. Garlinghouse Anticipates Gensler Removal as SEC Chair Discussing his expectations for the crypto market under Trump’s presidency, Garlinghouse referred to the U.S. president-elect as a strong crypto advocate. He highlighted the potential removal of SEC chair Gary Gensler as one of his key expectations for the new administration. This aligns with Trump’s campaign speech at the 2024 Bitcoin Conference, in which he promised to fire Gensler on his first day in office. It is common knowledge that Gensler is not in the good books of many crypto enthusiasts due to his regulatory approach, which favors enforcement actions over clear rulemaking. Garlinghouse suggested that the SEC chair has waged a war against the crypto industry, putting the U.S. behind other nations regarding clear crypto regulations. Hence, many crypto enthusiasts, including Garlinghouse, would consider Gensler’s exit a welcome development. XRP Non-Security Status Remains Law of the Land When asked about a potential resolution of the SEC v. Ripple lawsuit under the Trump-led administration, Garlinghouse refrained from giving a direct answer. However, he emphasized that XRP’s non-security status, as confirmed by U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres, remains the law of the land. He noted that even though the SEC appealed a part of the ruling—specifically regarding institutional sales of XRP— the commission did not challenge XRP’s non-security status. Notably, he expressed frustration about the lack of clarity for other crypto assets, including Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). Garlinghouse Criticizes SEC Labeling of Cryptos as Securities Furthermore, the Ripple CEO criticized the SEC”s position that most cryptocurrencies are securities. He noted that this claim is meaningless, given that crypto holders do not enjoy the benefits of securities, such as participating in profit-sharing. “[There is a need to] create clarity that the SEC is not the regulator that needs to own this [crypto] industry. They’ve been trying to regulate through enforcement rather than taking the time to write clear rules of the road,” he remarked. Following Trump’s re-election, the crypto industry is anticipating his inauguration, slated for January 20, 2025. Many believe his administration would provide the path for clear and fair crypto regulations, positioning the industry for immense growth.",POSITIVE,ETH | XRP,BTC | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/09/ripple-ceo-mentions-xrp-for-the-first-time-on-bbc/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ripple-ceo-mentions-xrp-for-the-first-time-on-bbc,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

35990305,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=93770,1731128500,"Here are 5 Major Factors That Could Take XRP to $1,000","While the $1,000 price target remains extremely ambitious for XRP, five bullish factors are capable of catalyzing a push toward this direction. XRP has not performed as anticipated since it collapsed from the $3.31 all-time high in January 2018. Despite its inability to reclaim even $1 over the past two years, some market commentators expect an eventual surge toward an audacious $1,000 price.In June, analyst BarriC presented a speculative scenario of the reactions that could fill the scene should XRP reach the $1,000 level. Also in June, another XRP community figure Amelie made a case for an XRP spike to $1,000, citing JPMorgan’s daily transaction volume. This represents one of the most ambitious price targets for XRP, and pessimism around it abounds. As a result, most pundits have expressed doubt . XRP is currently priced at $0.538, and reaching $1,000 would require an astronomical 185,773% increase. While this target seems wildly optimistic, several significant developments in the XRP ecosystem could contribute to upward momentum. Should XRP ever push toward this level, here are five developments that could catalyze such a spike.Smart Contracts on the XRP LedgerRipple’s push to integrate smart contracts into the XRP Ledger (XRPL) could be a major catalyst. The company is planning to launch an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain on the XRPL, allowing it to support decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Ripple is also exploring programmability through native smart contracts. This development could expand the use cases of XRP by attracting decentralized finance (DeFi).Launch of Ripple’s RLUSD StablecoinRipple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, is expected to launch in the next few weeks, according to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. He announced at Korea Blockchain Week last month that the USD-pegged stablecoin will be integrated directly into the XRP Ledger, aiming to boost liquidity and adoption. RLUSD could provide much-needed stability to XRP users and increase demand, particularly within the financial services sector. Ripple has already announced its initial exchange partners for the stablecoin, now awaiting regulatory approval to launch.Ripple IPORipple has been hinting at an initial public offering (IPO) for years, and many in the crypto space expect it to happen soon. The IPO could inject significant capital into Ripple, improving its ability to scale and develop new services. More importantly, an IPO would boost XRP's visibility and attract institutional investors, who may see Ripple's equity as a gateway into the broader crypto market. However, the timing of the IPO is still unclear, especially with Garlinghouse recently ruling out a U.S. public offering. Despite this, some argue that such an IPO in the U.S. is still possible, especially with the expected shift in regulatory environment from the recent Trump victory.Launch of a Spot XRP ETFThe launch of a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) could be another catalyst. If introduced, a spot ETF would allow institutional investors to gain exposure to XRP without needing to hold the asset directly. The XRP market recently witnessed the launch of XRP futures contracts, a major step toward a spot ETF. However, the SEC has been hesitant to approve crypto ETFs, especially those tied to digital assets other than Bitcoin and Ethereum. Despite this, three major asset managers, Canary Capitals, Bitwise and 21Shares, have all filed to launch an XRP ETF. In addition, Grayscale, the world's largest digital asset management firm, has also filed to convert its multi-asset GDLC Trust, which contains XRP, to an ETF.Increased XRP Adoption by Financial InstitutionsRipple’s partial victory over the SEC in July 2023 removed a major cloud hanging over XRP’s potential. Since the court ruled that XRP is not a security, institutions previously cautious about using or holding XRP might now be more willing to adopt it.Several banks and financial institutions have already been testing Ripple’s technology for cross-border payments. Increased adoption of Ripple's payment solutions could help boost XRP demand, but widespread institutional use is still speculative.",NEUTRAL,XRP,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/09/here-are-5-major-factors-that-could-take-xrp-to-1000/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=here-are-5-major-factors-that-could-take-xrp-to-1000,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Amid this, a CryptoQuant analyst known as TraderOasis provided an in-depth analysis of Bitcoin’s market earlier today, suggesting the trajectory the asset could head to next. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Bull Run: MVRV Metric Hints At $95K To $120K Target Analysis On Bitcoin Oasis explained that his previously outlined bullish scenario for the Range 0.5 structure had played out successfully, emphasizing the importance of Bitcoin’s previous all-time high (ATH) level as potential support. This level, represented by the blue line in his chart analysis (shown above), could be a critical marker for Bitcoin’s next phase, the analyst reveals. The analyst also highlighted the significance of the Coinbase Premium Index, which often indicates strong buying demand on Coinbase relative to other exchanges. Oasis noted that the bullish shift in this indicator was accompanied by an upward price move, marking an important resistance zone that Bitcoin needs to overcome to sustain its momentum. Furthermore, he pointed out that the open interest indicator, which tracks the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, was moving alongside the price. According to him, this is a positive signal indicating that market participation remains strong without signs of instability or excessive leverage. Rising Funding Rates And Exchange Netflow Observations TraderOasis also delved into another key metric: funding rates. These rates reflect the cost of holding long positions in perpetual futures contracts and can signal market sentiment. The analyst observed that funding rates had begun to rise again, suggesting that market participants are increasingly confident about further upward movement. However, he cautioned that this sentiment had not yet reached extreme levels that could indicate overheating or a potential correction. The analyst mentioned monitoring these levels is essential, as excessive funding rates often signal market tops or heightened volatility. Another aspect of analysis was the activity observed in exchange netflow for spot exchanges. According to Oasis, a significant sell-off was reflected in this indicator, which measures the net flow of Bitcoin into and out of exchanges. Given the potential for increased volatility, the analyst interpreted this as a signal to consider taking profits on long trades. This aligns with previous market patterns where high net inflows or outflows often foreshadow shifts in market sentiment and price direction.

For many reasons, this year’s US presidential elections have become the most consequential for cryptocurrency. Crypto and blockchain technology has become an election issue, with both the Republican and Democratic candidates teasing the electorate with their plans on how to handle crypto. Related Reading: Binance Coin Breaks $600! Is There More Upside Ahead For BNB? Between the two, incoming President Donald Trump offered a more friendly stance over crypto, promising to make the US a “crypto capital” and suggesting a change in leadership at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Now that Trump is the next president, all eyes are on the SEC and the expected reshuffle. And the latest political chatter suggests that the high-profile job will probably go to Dan Gallagher, Robinhood’s Chief Legal Officer. Many expect Trump to announce in January 2025 the next SEC chief, as the clamor for the agency’s Gary Gensler’s exit intensifies. Gensler In Hot Seat Before Elections Many expect Gensler to be one of the high-profile exits once Trump takes office. Gensler has waged legal fights against the crypto community for years, including Binance and Ripple’s XRP. His aggressive policies against crypto and its personalities have earned him plenty of detractors and enemies. With Gensler’s increasing unpopularity, many have demanded his resignation. Trump acknowledged the issue and promised a revamp of the SEC once he wins. Even Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse has blamed Gensler for the Democrat’s loss this election. Now, Reuters reports that Robinhood’s Dan Gallagher is considered the top contender for Gensler’s post. Robinhood’s Dan Gallagher As Next SEC Chair? Dan Gallagher currently serves as Robinhood’s Chief Legal Officer. Gallagher was a SEC commissioner from 2011 to 2015 before joining the company. Also, Gallagher enjoys wide popularity among cryptocurrency bigwigs, especially among Trump donors. At least two sources have confirmed that the former SEC commissioner is in the running to become the next chair of the agency. Although the selection process is still open, Gallagher’s pro-innovation policies give him an advantage over other hopefuls. He advocates for tighter regulation of cryptocurrencies and supports market liberalization. Previously, Gallagher campaigned to treat digital assets like Bitcoin as a distinct asset class, not as securities. In short, the SEC can see a more crypto-friendly policy once Gallagher takes oath. Related Reading: Solana Rockets Past BNB To Claim Coveted 4th Spot In Crypto Ranks Other Candidates In Consideration Aside from Gallagher, a few other names are floated as Gensler’s replacement. For example, some in the crypto industry are looking at Hester Pierce, who is a SEC Commissioner, to become the next SEC chair. However, some insiders have shared that Pierce isn’t keen on taking the job. Another candidate in the running is Mark Uyeda, who was appointed as SEC commissioner on June 30, 2022. Multiple reports also mentioned Paul Atkins, former Republican SEC Commissioner, and Robert Stebbins – who was named SEC General Counsel in May 2017 — as possible Gensler replacement.

In several posts on X, prominent fund managers and industry leaders have projected a bullish outlook for Ethereum (ETH), positioning it to outperform Bitcoin (BTC) with a target price of $8,000. This optimism is underpinned by anticipated regulatory advancements for the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Why Ethereum Could Outperform Bitcoin Raoul Pal, Founder and CEO of Global Macro Investor, articulated his perspective on ETH’s potential resurgence in a post that has garnered significant attention within the crypto community. “I’ve been expecting ETH to start gaining lost ground on BTC. It’s partly driven by the risk-taking cycle but it’s also driven by the election,” Pal stated. Pal highlighted two primary factors contributing to ETH’s anticipated outperformance. The first one is the enhanced utility in DeFi: “Utility tokens in DeFi begin to offer yield or reward of underlying protocol which creates network value. Most of this is on ETH,” Pal explained. Related Reading: Ethereum Jumps 10% As DeFi Sentiment Rebounds With Trump’s Victory The second factor is the adoption by Traditional Finance (TradFi). “TradFi will likely begin to build larger use cases but on the most tested, adopted chain. Think of ETH (and the L2’s) as the Microsoft of web3. No one gets fired for using it,” Pal asserted. These developments, according to Pal, are poised to “dramatically re-rate ETH and offset the current retail adoption on other chains,” with the added advantage that ETH yields will attract more institutional players. He emphasized the potential for constructing sophisticated financial products, such as guaranteed funds, under improved regulatory conditions. “With better regs this activity will explode,” Pal concluded. Supporting Pal’s outlook, Dan Tapiero, founder and CEO of 10T Holdings—a growth equity fund specializing in mid-to-late stage investments within the digital asset ecosystem—commented on Pal’s post: “Yup. More eloquent version of what I posted last night. Very funny.” Tapiero referenced his own earlier assertion that “Ethereum too cheap. Gonna explode from here. Gensler and Co killed Defi in the US in ’22-24. Not killed now. Long Live US Defi. Break of $4k going over $8k in the next year.” Related Reading: Ethereum Surges Past $2,500: What The Futures Market Signals For Traders However, Pal also noted a hierarchical adoption landscape within the crypto space, suggesting that while ETH may outpace BTC, it might underperform Solana (SOL) and, subsequently, Sui (SUI). “My view is that ETH begins to outpace BTC for the rest of the cycle but underperforms SOL and SOL underperforms SUI as SUI is in the ultimate performance stage of adoption – early > proven. Let’s see,” he remarked. The discourse around Ethereum’s prospects also attracted engagement from the broader crypto community. A user named Himura (@aceddeca1) proposed an alternative investment thesis: “ETH will be fine but if that is your thesis it would be better spent on UNI especially with Unichain … Uniswap going to own chain is the base token you wish Coinbase would launch.” Pal responded succinctly, “Interesting thought.” Additionally, concerns regarding potential biases were raised by user Galavis (@FedericoGalavis): “Be careful with SUI folks as only 0.82% of the supply has been unlocked. Are you a paid SUI promoter Raoul? If you are you better disclose.” Pal countered, “You need to do more research on all your comments,” addressing the speculation over his impartiality. Notably, Pal serves as a Board Member at the Sui Foundation, a fact that may inform perceptions of his commentary on SUI. At press time, ETH traded at $2,916.

Its accompanying SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust ( NYSEARCA: SPY ) jumped 4.75% for the week. One of the most pivotal weeks of the year turned out to be records galore for Wall Street. The benchmark S&P ( SP500 ) took its tally of all-time closing highs to a half century for 2024, while also smashing past the 6,000 points level in a historic first. Though the gauge was unable to close above that mark, it was still on track to post its shortest gap between 1,000-point milestones on record. As if that weren't enough, the index posted its best weekly advance in just over a year. Meanwhile, the venerable Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJI ) notched its 41st and 42nd record close of the year, while also taking out the 44,000 points level for the first time ever. The blue-chip index posted its best weekly advance in just over a year as well. Moreover, its advance on Wednesday was its best intraday performance since November 10, 2022. Market participants began the week cautiously on Monday, as they geared up for the culmination of the U.S. presidential election on Tuesday and the penultimate Federal Reserve interest rate decision of the year on Thursday. On Election Day, the S&P ( SP500 ), Dow ( DJI ) and fellow major index the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( COMP:IND ) rallied ahead of the count. Then, as election night unfolded, and it started to become clear that former President Donald Trump was going to win, the so-called ""Trump trade"" gripped markets. U.S. stock futures swelled overnight, while assets that were seen to be benefiting by a second Trump administration saw a boost. The dollar soared, amid expectations that the greenback would rise in a low-tax and high-tariff environment. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) undoubtedly saw the most dramatic reaction, smashing past the $75K level. It has been embraced by Trump in his campaign, who this year became the first-ever major U.S. party nominee to accept donations in bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and other cryptocurrencies. By the early hours of Wednesday, Trump, a Republican, had secured the 270 electoral votes needed to win against Democratic opponent Vice President Kamala Harris. The GOP also won the Senate, while the House remains undecided, though a red sweep seems most likely. The Trump trade lifted off in regular trading hours, with the S&P ( SP500 ) and the Dow ( DJI ) eventually notching their best post-election intraday climbs ever. The latter popped more than 1,500 points. ""A decisive U.S. election outcome requires a rethink of the global macroeconomic outlook, as our baseline, as well as most others, has incorporated an assumption of policy continuity. Within this framework that we have been pushing back against, most central banks and private forecasters project inflation returning quickly to 2% almost everywhere with growth proceeding at a trend-like pace,"" JPMorgan's Bruce Kasman said. On Thursday, the focus shifted to the Fed. The central bank delivered a 25 basis point rate cut as widely expected, following which chair Jerome Powell said both the labor market and inflation was normalizing . Traders took heart from Powell's remarks, and his praise of the resilience of the economy, and continued to be in a buying mood. That spilled into Friday, which gave enough of a boost to the S&P ( SP500 ) and Dow ( DJI ) to take out their historic milestones. Turning to the weekly performance of the S&P 500 ( SP500 ) sectors, all 11 ended in the green, led by a nearly 8% climb in Consumer Discretionary and a 6% rise in Energy. Technology added more than 5%.

35953798,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652197,1731112239,PEPE Slips Into Correction: Here Are Key Levels To Watch For A Rebound,"After a strong upward momentum, PEPE is showing signs of fatigue, slipping into a correctional phase, with traders speculating on what might come next. As the token retraces from recent highs, attention now turns to pivotal support levels that could dictate its recovery potential. Will these key levels hold the line and fuel a bounce-back, or is PEPE in for a longer dip? This article will provide an in-depth look at PEPE’s current price movement within its correctional phase. By highlighting significant support and resistance levels, this piece seeks to equip investors and traders with valuable insights into possible rebound zones and the factors that could influence its recovery or further declines. Understanding PEPE’s Correction: What Triggered The Pullback? PEPE has recently taken a bearish shift on the 4-hour chart, encountering strong resistance at $0.00001152. This struggle to sustain the uptrend has triggered a decline, pushing the asset toward the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). A drop below this SMA could amplify selling pressure, while a rebound might signal a potential price reversal. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests that bullish strength may be waning. Currently, the RSI has fallen to around 68% from the overbought zone, indicating that the buying pressure is diminishing. If the RSI continues to drop, it may indicate that the market is becoming more oversold, possibly paving the way for a deeper correction. Related Reading: Analyst Says PEPE Bearish Continuation Is Possible For A 50% Price Crash On the daily chart, PEPE is exhibiting significant negative movement, as reflected by a bearish candlestick. This ongoing downward trend highlights a prevailing selling pressure within the market. Although the meme coin is currently trading above the 100-day SMA, which is typically seen as a bullish indicator, the strength of the bearish candlestick suggests that upward momentum may be limited. Finally, on the 1-day chart, the RSI signal line is approaching the critical 50% level after rising above it. The 50% mark represents a neutral zone, suggesting a balance between buying and selling pressure. A dip below 50% could signal a shift towards bearish sentiment, while holding above or climbing back above 50% may imply continued bullish strength, possibly leading to more price gains. Where PEPE Could Find Stability Key support levels are crucial price points where PEPE could find stability and reverse its current downtrend. One of the primary support levels to watch is the $0.000000766, which has historically acted as a crucial level of support. If PEPE’s price approaches this level, it could trigger renewed buying interest, potentially leading to a rebound.

However, should the meme coin break this level, it could lead to a prolonged decline, possibly pushing the price toward $0.00000589 and beyond.
