42400240,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIxaz,1501025450,Token Summit Creator: SEC ICO Guidance a 'Breath of Fresh Air',"It might not be the first reaction you'd expect from one of the people most responsible for popularizing the use of cryptographic tokens as an investment tool.  However, the founder of the Token Summit conference that helped bring the concept to the fore of the industry believes new comments from the US Securities and Exchange Commission will do much to encourage the sector to improve. Issued today, the SEC found that tokens issued by an ethereum project called The DAO were securities, setting off shockwaves in an industry that had long been expecting such news.  Still, investor and author William Mougayar believes that the guidance offered will help ""elevate the standards"" of entrepreneurs seeking to leverage the funding model.  Citing recent commentary in which he has spoke out about the adverse effects of quickening growth in the sector, Mougayar called the finding that some ICOs may meet the definition of a security ""well balanced"" and a ""breath of fresh air.""  Mougayar told CoinDesk:  ""The SEC poured some cold water on two key aspects that were weak links in the ICO value chain. One, the overly promotional aspects in communicating ICOs, and two, the lack of transparency in disclosing essential and non-obtuse information for consumers.""  As such, Mougayar said that the published guidance from the SEC, which observers cited as rare in the scope and coordination, should do much to help the industry improve as it seeks mainstream users.  He concluded:  ""The SEC position re-enforces the need for increased discipline in ICO practices.""

42400234,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIxY2,1501023869,'Not a Surprise': Blockchain Industry Saw SEC ICO Action Coming,"The SEC said today that some initial coin offerings (ICOs) may qualify as securities sales – a move that while expansive in impact, wasn't that surprising to legal and regulatory observers in the space.  As CoinDesk reported earlier today, the US agency revealed that it has completed an investigation into the creation and subsequent collapse of The DAO, the ethereum-based, smart contract-powered funding vehicle that fell apart following a devastating code exploit last summer. Ultimately, it did not take action against those behind the project.  Still, as part of its review, the SEC found that tokens issued in conjunction with the project were captured under its definition for securities, and it notably said that other tokens sold by way of an ICO fundraising model could receive a similar qualification as well.  Reaction to the finding was swift.  Washington, DC-based lawyer Stephen Palley told CoinDesk that the agency's release ""confirms that securities laws don't stop at computer keyboard"", but that it was ""frankly, not a huge surprise.""  Palley went on to speak to the uncertainty in the SEC's statements – namely, its lack of determination on which blockchain tokens qualify as securities and which do not.  He told CoinDesk:  ""What remains unclear is how the SEC will view many other token sales that have since taken place in the US, directed by US citizens. Those that have adopted creative workarounds to address securities laws may be wondering if their approach was sound.""  No surprises here  That lack of surprise was shared by other commentators reached by CoinDesk staff.  Preston Byrne, a technology lawyer with expertise in cryptocurrencies, said that ""the only thing I find surprising about the SEC's findings is that it took this long to publish them.""  A long-time critic of the concept, he spoke of what could be a coming crackdown on what had been an active sector of the industry.  ""Smarter token issuers [have] taken great pains to keep these offerings out of the US and avoid listing their tokens on US-based exchanges,"" he continued. ""Whether that is sufficient to avoid liability in the US is something which will vary on a case-by-case basis.""  Steven Obie, a partner at international law firm Jones Day, added that those with experience in securities regulation weren't be surprised either.  ""Those formulating an ICO need to account for today's action by the SEC, seek guidance from experienced counsel in formulating their ICO and analyzing the legal issues, and consider dialoguing with SEC staff,"" he said.  More action to come?  Perhaps one of the most notable elements of the release was the fact that the SEC didn't issue a blanket characterization for blockchain tokens as securities – rather, it said that those determinations would be made on a case-by-case basis, with some falling in that definition and others outside it.  Coin Center director of research Peter Van Valkenburgh argued that those classifications will boil down to whether a token has a functional utility as opposed to acting as a vehicle for speculation.  ""We believe that applying the same facts and circumstances test to other tokens will mean that some do not fit into the definition of securities, particularly tokens with an underlying utility rather than a mere speculative investment value,"" he said in an email.  Outcome aside, commentators like Perianne Boring, founder of the non-profit industry advocacy group the Chamber of Digital Commerce, reckoned that the move ultimately signals that the SEC is likely to take more action in this area.  Boring told CoinDesk:  ""We view this as a shot across the bow to those who are issuing or plan to issue tokens that the SEC will aggressively apply its laws.""

42400224,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIxOC,1501020038,Emin Gun Sirer: SEC ICO Guidance is 'End of Beginning for Blockchains',"The Cornell University professor who was among the first to warn about the vulnerabilities that led to the collapse of The DAO has issued new statements on a ruling today from the US Securities and Exchange Commission finding the project had indeed issued securities.  A prominent public critic of the project, Emin Gun Sirer was vocal about its issues, though his statements often pointed to weak points in its technical design. At the time, he called out issues with the project's voting mechanisms, alongside possible attacks that could be launched against its code (and eventually were).  In remarks following the SEC's statements today, Sirer cautioned that the ruling could have an impact equaling The DAO's collapse in its industry impact. In fact, he went so far as to say the finding by the US regulator may have a ""chilling effect"" on innovation.  However, ultimately, he said it is likely to usher in a new, more tempered era of industry development, one that fosters sustainable, long-lasting project development.  Sirer told CoinDesk:  ""This portends the end of the beginning for blockchains. We can no longer count on regulators not understanding what a blockchain is, nor can people use the veneer of a block-oriented data structure to subvert the law. In turn, it represents public acceptance of on-chain financial instruments as being equivalent to traditional ones.""  If the ruling is being taken as a setback, it's one from which Sirer believes the industry can recover.  Looking ahead, Sirer sought to position it as a moment that could serve as a call to action for the industry, concluding:  ""In the next chapter, we will see the cryptocurrency community focus more on its competency and innovative technology, and less on disguised financial instruments, and we will see the financial incumbents challenged by fundamentally innovative technology that can do what has never been done.""

42400230,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIxU6,1501015441,SEC: US Securities Laws 'May Apply' to Token Sales,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission said today that the offering and sale of digital tokens ""are subject to the requirements of the federal securities law.""  The agency, in its statement, revealed that it had been investigating the issuance of tokens connected to The DAO, the ethereum-based funding vehicle that collapsed dramatically last summer following an exploit of a flaw in its code.  Per the SEC, those ""DAO tokens"" constitute securities, though the agency said that it was not going to pursue any charges in connection with the project, but is releasing its finding ""to caution the industry and market participants.""  The agency said:  ""...the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to issue this Report in order to stress that the U.S. federal securities law may apply to various activities, including distributed ledger technology, depending on the particular facts and circumstances, without regard to the form of the organization or technology used to effectuate a particular offer or sale.""  Stephanie Avakian, co-director of the SEC's Enforcement Division, added in a statement:  ""The innovative technology behind these virtual transactions does not exempt securities offerings and trading platforms from the regulatory framework designed to protect investors and the integrity of the markets.""  In tandem with the DAO report, the SEC published an investor bulletin about initial coin offerings, or ICOs. Among the items included was a warning about the risks of fraud for those who opt to participate.  ""Investing in an ICO may limit your recovery in the event of fraud or theft. While you may have rights under the federal securities laws, your ability to recover may be significantly limited,"" the bulletin read.  The move comes months after the SEC was formally petitioned to issue guidance on blockchain assets and ICOs, effectively ending a period of doubt as to what approach the SEC would take.

According to CoinDesk data, the price of ether – the cryptocurrency of the ethereum network – fell to as low as $196, with data provider Ethereumprice.org showing the market's weighted average sliding to $195.59 during recent trading. The last time ether prices fell below $200 was on July 19, available market data reveals.  At press time, the price of ether is at $197.35, representing a decline of roughly 11.5% since the day's open of $223.23.  Similarly sharp price drops are occurring in other cryptocurrency markets, according to CoinMarketCap.com data site, with the top 10 (by market cap) all demonstrating declines of 7% or greater.  Bitcoin prices are down roughly 10% today, CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) data shows, trading at about $2,503 as of press time. Bitcoin markets hit a low of $2,487.13 during the day's trading, after opening at $2,779.04, according to the BPI.  NEM, Monero and Stratis saw significant declines as well, with those markets dropping by roughly 12%, 13% and 23% as of press time, respectively.  The declines come after cryptocurrency markets spiked upwards on Friday, climbing above the $90bn market cap line for the first time in weeks. Currently, the collective market capitalization for the world's cryptocurrency markets stands at roughly $84.9bn, according to CoinMarketCap.

42400223,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIxPB,1501002018,Putin's Internet Advisor: 30% of Russian Computers Infected By Crypto Mining Malware,"An advisor to President Vladimir Putin has claimed that as many as a quarter of computers in Russia are infected with cryptocurrency mining malware.  Herman Klimenko, who advises Putin on issues related to the internet, recently told a domestic broadcaster that ""it is estimated that 20-30% of devices are infected with this virus"", according to Moscow-based news service RBC.  Mining is an energy intensive process by which new transactions are added to a blockchain, minting new coins for the miner in the process. In the past, cybercriminals have sought to generate funds by using malicious software to effectively hijack computers remotely and use their processing power to mine.  Yet Klimenko – who once said that accepting bitcoin for payment constitutes a crime – is receiving pushback against his claims, including from another Russian government official. Dmitry Marinichev, who serves as Russia's internet ombudsman, called the claim ""nonsense"" in an interview with RBC, adding that such a scale of infection would be hard to miss.  According to RBC, other cybersecurity experts are also calling foul on Klimenko's claims.  Russian anti-virus software developer Kapersky Lab told the news service that its data shows that roughly 6 of its customers have been targeted by mining malware since the start of 2017. Another Russian anti-virus vendor, Doctor Web, also indicated that the true number of affected devices is far lower than the amount claimed by the Putin advisor.  ""If it were about 20-30%, it would be an epidemic and everyone would know about it. There are infections by miners, but it's impossible to say that they are infected with a third of users,"" Vyacheslav Medvedev, an analyst for Doctor Web, said of the claims.

42400235,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIxZ1,1500998412,Australian Bitcoin Exchange Raises $815k in Series A Funding,"An Australian bitcoin exchange has reportedly raised $815,000 in Series A funding.  According to Business Insider, the Melbourne-based Bitcoin.com.au received the funds from Alium Cpital and Dominet Venture Partners. The new funding will be used to expand the startup's overseas operations in the UK and Canada. Founder and chief executive Rupert Hackett told the publication that the funding would also fuel the integration of other cryptocurrencies, including ethereum and XRP.  Bitcoin.com.au offers both online and physical bitcoin exchange services in Australia, in partnership with domestic retailers financial firms. The report suggests that the final raise amount was higher than originally planned, as the startup had intended to raise $500k to support its efforts.  In statements, Alium Capital partner Rajeev Gupta suggested that the investment would help his firm gain further exposure to the burgeoning cryptocurrency space.  ""We believe Rupert and the team at Bitcoin.com.au provide a platform that is a pure play 21st century asset class for digital cryptocurrencies in Australia,"" he said.  The new funding follows moves by Australian regulators to improve conditions for startups working with digital currencies, especially a decision earlier this year to finally remove a much-maligned ""double tax"" on bitcoin purchases.  As reported earlier this year, the Australian Treasury has eliminated a goods-and-services tax on bitcoin purchases, an act that the Australian government noted will foster digital currency business development in the country.

42400232,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIxV5,1500994852,Infosys EdgeVerve Expands Blockchain Integration to Sales Platform,"A subsidiary of Indian IT giant Infosys is pushing ahead with its plans for blockchain in a bid to create new revenue streams.  In a filing submitted earlier this month to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which detailed an earnings call from July 14, Infosys detailed work on blockchain being conducted by its EdgeVerve Systems subsidiary. EdgeVerve first unveiled its plans for the tech in April 2016, after it revealed the launch of a blockchain services platform focused on international remittances.  Now, EdgeVerve is expanding past that initial use case, looking to integrate the tech into a global sales platform it operates. The company is in the process of incorporating blockchain into TradeEdge, first launched in 2013.  ""Our TradeEdge network now with more than 2,000 partners, processes approximately 3 billion transactions per month. We are now integrating our blockchain network with this TradeEdge network to open significant monetization opportunities for clients,"" the company said in the SEC filing.  What that integration will look like remains to be seen. But in a recent interview with Quartz, EdgeVerve associate VP Rajashekara Maiya highlighted security as one of its major draws.  ""Using blockchain makes transactions secure, unhackable, and transparent. It takes out the middleman, provides real-time online transactions, and data is safe,"" Maiya told the publication.

42400246,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIxgt,1500991116,American Express Brings Credit Card Buying to Bitcoin App Abra,"Beginning today, a select group of Abra users and new customers will see the option to buy bitcoin with their American Express card.  The months-long integration process between the two companies involved Abra exposing the depths of its business processes to its partner and investor, and has resulted in an even closer relationship between the firms.  Still, Abra founder and CEO Bill Barhydt believes the end result of that effort could be a rapid acceleration of bitcoin adoption globally.  Barhydt told CoinDesk:  ""Abra has to become effectively an American Express processor internally in order to do this, because we're processing directly with American Express. There's no third-party acquirer in the middle.""  This means users whose American Express purchase option is enabled today can now purchase up to $200 worth of bitcoin per day, and up to $1,000 of bitcoin per month for a 4 percent fee.  Designed to cover Abra's own costs, Barhydt said the startup doesn't expect to generate any revenue from the fees, but will rather earn its share from managing the exchange rates between US dollars and bitcoin.  American Express spokesperson Elizabeth Crosta clarified that while Abra’s customers are now able to fund their wallets with American Express Abra is not processing the transaction.  All hands on deck  But it's perhaps the scale of what was needed to make this feature a reality that is most notable.  In the weeks leading up to today's launch, Abra employees, American Express staff and Abra investors have been testing the integration, Barhydt said. In spite of the tests though, the remaining Abra customers won't receive permission to conduct American Express purchases until initial users safely complete purchases.  ""There are some potentially unsavory folks in our universe,"" said Barhydt. ""And we want to make sure we're servicing the people whose intentions are good, and not the other folks.""  Eligible cards include American Express US consumer cards, American Express-branded cards issued by third parties and American Express re-loadable prepaid cards, Bluebird and American Express Serve, which can be purchased at Walmart, CVS, Walgreens and more.  ""Anybody who shops at Walmart can walk into a Walmart store anywhere in the country, buy a Bluebird card at check-out, put all the money they need to on that card, register that card, and once the card arrives at their home, they can immediately load those funds into their Abra app,"" Barhydt said.  To pull off the months-long project, Barhydt said the two companies invested ""significant"" resources integrating on a technical level to ensure satisfactory security on both sides of the deal.  In particular, Barhydt said his firm was asked to reveal how it works with exchange partners, as well as its know-your-customer process.  After raising $14m venture capital from American Express Ventures and others, Abra now lets its customer store funds in both bitcoin and fiat currency with support from banks including Bank of America, Capital One, and Chase, along with credit unions from Charles Schwab, Fidelity, and Wells Fargo.  But Abra too had its own concerns about American Express’s KYC practices.  As result, the ""instant issue"" capability of some reloadable cards has been disabled. Instead of being able to add cash to a card and spend it immediately, customers will have to have to go through extra steps to connect their identity to the funds.  ""You will have to register the card with American Express and wait for the fully registered card to arrive in the mail,"" said Barhydt.  The bitcoin boost?  Still, Barhydt believes the work is worth it.  In interview, he cited American Express's brand credibility as among the reasons the partnership is a boon for not only his company, but for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies generally. But there's little doubt the potential benefits could go both ways.  As American Express competitors Visa and Mastercard each begin testing the waters with blockchain, the Abra partnership also signifies an industry-wide search for increased efficiency and speed that the technology could bring.  But while both parties potentially stand to gain from the partnership, neither is depending exclusively on the other.  In January, American Express joined blockchain consortium Hyperledger, which is exploring ways to capitalize on the technology without cryptocurrency at all. Further, Abra itself is excited about what the partnership could mean for blazing trails with other credit card companies, even even among it's own bitcoin payments competitors.  ""Having a traditional card network partner directly with a company directly in the cryptocurrency world is a huge win for the space, and it’s been a long time coming,"" said Barhydt, who concluded:  ""I’m quite confident it will lead to even bigger and better things for Abra and the entire space down the road.""

42400242,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIxcx,1500987768,Months to Minutes: Enigma Launch Aims to Boost Crypto Hedge Fund Creation,"What if starting a hedge fund was as easy as downloading an API?  A startup incubated at MIT Media Lab is today revealing a product designed with this ease-of-use in mind. Called Catalyst, the first product offering by blockchain startup Enigma aims to trigger nothing short of an explosion of new hedge funds focused on cryptocurrency as an asset class.  By drawing directly from lessons learned by traditional asset managers like Citadel and Sigma Two, Enigma seeks to standardize how cryptocurrency hedge funds are created, thereby reducing the time it takes to code their set-up and lowering the barrier to entry for investors.  According to Enigma co-founder, Guy Zyskind, however, the launch is part of a bigger plan that makes it easier for investors to recoup returns on the principal.  Zyskind, who helped start the project while he was still a student at MIT, explained that the venture-backed platform is best seen a gateway to an even larger market of information.  Zyskind told CoinDesk:  ""We want to introduce the idea of data marketplaces to the community by having a project around crypto-financial markets. We think that would be a good way to introduce our data encryption technology later on.""  In this way, the alpha version of Catalyst, previously revealed last month, aims to get early developers to download the API, receive an API key and start building with early data sets provided by exchanges.  Developers will then be able compete in weekly contests and win rewards in Enigma's native token, to be launched later this year.  ""They can start accessing, and play around with strategies,"" said Zyskind. ""They can also share their strategies with other people in the system and they will be able to share data sets.""  The pivot  Stepping back, the launch represents a pivot of sorts for the startup.  Initially conceived in 2015, Enigma was meant to be a way to create markets where anyone could sell information, and where the source of the data could be trusted without users having to reveal unnecessary identifiable information.  But without a clear business use case, interest in the technology wavered. Then, earlier this year, Enigma kicked off a market research study with employees at quant funds and asset management firms.  According to Enigma chief product officer, Can Kisagun, approximately 60 percent of hedge fund managers polled reported being interested in ""getting into crypto,"" and as many as 20 percent of them had already ""retrofitted"" their existing technology in an attempt to account for 24-hour trade times and assets that can be divided into tiny fractional amounts.  Kisagun explained how that data helped inform the use case they selected to help prove the value of information markets, stating:  ""In the world where Catalyst exists, all that two months' worth of effort is available to use through an API download, and we can jumpstart that two month setup to start experimenting with trading strategies from day one.""  Hybrid funding  As is increasingly the case among industry startups, Enigma is employing a two-pronged strategy for its funding, using both traditional venture capital and a planned initial coin offering (ICO).  Revealed to CoinDesk for the first time, the Boston startup has raised $1.35 million from Floodgate, MIT and other participants. Armed with this backing, the firm plans to eventually expand its hedge fund service into the broader information market.  Yet, in preparation for the company’s push into the increasingly competitive space, the founders are preparing to raise approximately an additional $20 million worth of ether by selling tokens in August.  By building trading data and strategy insight into the token-exchange process, Zyskind believes he can incentivize the community of users to refine the hedge fund process, and eventually, the process of exchanging data broadly.  Zyskind concluded:  ""It plays very well with our initial idea that data should be incentivized. Having our tokens be the means of transportation of data is what we feel is really strong in creating that community.""

42400243,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIxdw,1500985824,Automaker Renault Trials Blockchain in Bid to Secure Car Repair Data,"French automaker Renault has unveiled a new digitized car maintenance log prototype built using blockchain.  Announced today, the project saw Renault working with tech firms Microsoft and VISEO to develop the prototype. A Chinese startup, BitSe, was said to have also worked on the design. Microsoft's cloud-based Azure platform – which has become the focal point for the tech firm's blockchain strategy – was used to host it.  According to Renault, the basic premise is that information about a car's maintenance history is kept by a range of sources, including repair shops and dealerships, making it harder to keep track of new changes. By contrast, the digital maintenance log prototype puts all of this information in one place.  ""This digital car maintenance book will enable us to provide our customers with new services in an ecosystem alongside insurers and dealers. Blockchain technology is able to create a reliable trust protocol,” Elie Elbaz, digital and connected vehicles director for Groupe Renault, said in a statement.  The move to develop the prototype comes months after Renault's automotive financing subsidiary, RCI Bank and Services, joined the R3 distributed ledger consortium. At the time, the entry into the group was positioned as a part of a broader digitization effort within RCI.  Other automakers in Europe, including Porsche and Daimler, have also taken steps in recent months to explore or integrate the technology.  Looking ahead, Renault indicated that it would look to the tech for further use cases, including vehicle-based micro-transactions.

42400245,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIxfu,1500982306,What's Left Before SegWit Goes Live? Bitcoin's Path to More Capacity,"Bitcoin is on the road to increasing its capacity – but it's not there yet.  Despite the claim bitcoin has been upgraded to support Segregated Witness-style transactions, there are more steps that need to occur before its distributed network can process additional data.  In fact, due to the complexities of keeping bitcoin's distributed network in unison, the change might not take hold until late August.  The timeline  That said, with BIP 91 activated, bitcoin is now headed down a path toward that possible outcome.  In context, this means that BIP 148, a proposal that seeks to upgrade the network to SegWit using different code, is no longer likely (though it's still possible). As such, one avenue that would find bitcoin splitting into two blockchains has been diminished, though it would be wrong to say it has been eliminated entirely – even in the short term.  Rather, SegWit now needs to follow a timeline designed to give miners and node operators ample time to upgrade their software, one that must also operate within the larger constraints of bitcoin's design.  Here's a best-case scenario of how this might unfold:  As illustrated above, miners must now signal support for SegWit until the code achieves ""lock in"" and ""activation,"" two separate milestones with unique requirements.  Short-term complications  Still, things could go awry.  For example, it's possible that bitcoin's miners could stop signaling support for SegWit ahead of the BIP 141 ""lock in"" deadline (although they'd risk having their blocks rejected by the network, losing the rewards).  While all nodes appear to be signaling correctly, it's hard to know exactly who is running the software – this means that miners could fail to reject a block that wasn't signaling for SegWit, continue adding new blocks on top of that block, and ultimately, produce an alternative chain.  Adding to the argument is that miner support for the idea has notably wavered in the past, with some asserting it's largely the threat that users could push through a change that could lead to a split that has kept miners in check.  Litecoin's attempts at integrating SegWit adds context to this theory.  As much as 75% of litecoin's mining hashrate, for instance, was signaling for SegWit in April, meaning it reached the necessary threshold to lock in SegWit. But miner support dropped off soon after. This sparked protocol creator Charlie Lee and other litecoin users to threaten to code an alternative user-activated soft fork (UASF) proposal.  Shortly thereafter, a roundtable was held that united major miners, at which time they agreed to signal support for SegWit.  Should similar psychology come into play here, the idea is that (after averting a UASF on bitcoin on August 1), miner support for SegWit may wane, though the economic stakes here are arguably higher.  Long-term complications  But even if SegWit passes, that still only enacts one-half of the Segwit2x proposal.  An informal agreement among businesses and miners reached in May, the goal of the initiative was to push the capabilities of the software even further (some would argue too far beyond what should be advocated by prudent development).  As developer Jeff Garzik put forward in an interview this weekend, he still plans to help push forward an effort that would seek to upgrade the block size to 2MB, and to enact the upgrade via a process known as a hard fork.  The argument against that approach is that research in this area is still underdeveloped, though Garzik has argued SegWit could fail to introduce the capacity changes promised by those who have championed its integration.  This determination (as well as the acrimony Garzik's outlook has caused in the developer community that argue this claim and others he's made are false) could make a split later in the year more likely.  And it's quite possible this chart will become more complex as this date approaches and different groups attempt to influence the outcome.

42400229,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIxT7,1500976922,A Russian Airline Is Now Using Blockchain to Issue Tickets,"Russia's biggest airline is now issuing passenger tickets on a blockchain with support from the country's largest private bank.  According to a local report by the media outlet Kommersant, the airline S7 and its ticketing agent S7 Ticket reportedly began the sales on the ethereum blockchain this week. Lending support is Alfa-Bank, Russia's biggest private banking institution.  The report notes that the platform is designed to reduce settlement times between between the airline and the agent, which today take around two weeks. It further strives to streamline the payment process by deducting the agent commission automatically after ticket sales to reflect the final receipt.  As such, the collaboration can be seen as an early attempt in the industry to use ethereum technology in simplifying the airline ticketing process, though this has long been suggested as a possible blockchain use case.  The report does not specify whether the platform is built on a private or public version of ethereum.  Previously  , S7 Airlines and Alfa-Bank were reported to be exploring the use of smart contracts in tracking letters of credit.

According to CNBC, the report outlines methods by which cryptocurrencies can be weighed against other commodities, singling out safety and liquidity as potential factors. The paper was penned by Francisco Blanch, who works as the bank's lead commodity and derivatives strategist.  In the report, Blanch opines that a watershed moment would come should banks begin taking bitcoin as a form of collateral for products. While this represents a ""crucial hurdle,"" he went on to say that ""we are not aware of any major institution that takes cryptocurrency as collateral at the moment.""  Blanch drew a comparison between bitcoin and commodities such as gold and silver, noting that, in the past year, volatility in bitcoin markets was seen to fall below levels witnessed in markets for the latter precious metal.  ""Bitcoin's volatility is very high compared to the euro, the yen or even gold,"" he wrote, according to CNBC. ""But it fell twice last year below the volatility of silver, the world's currency for 400 years.""  Though not publicly available for view, the client-oriented report echoes those released by other Wall Street analysts, such as those from investment bank Goldman Sachs. That firm has released two client notes related to bitcoin since the start of the summer.

42400241,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIxby,1500964266,Bitcoin Investment Firm Launches Ethereum-Subscribed ICO Fund,"The operators of a regulated, Jersey-based bitcoin fund have officially closed a new $5 million fund aimed at investing in cryptocurrency tokens and initial coin offerings (ICOs).  Backed by fund manager and former JP Morgan trader Daniel Masters, the offering by Global Advisors is the latest in a string of funds aimed at offering accredited investors exposure to the burgeoning crypto asset class. However, it may be unique in that those who committed investment funds did so in ether, the native cryptocurrency on the ethereum blockchain.  Speaking exclusively to CoinDesk, chairman Daniel Masters stressed this detail as the fund's defining attribute.  Masters said:  ""I'm sure this was the first fund in the history of finance where everyone who subscribed to the fund did so via ethereum.""  In statements, Masters added that key selling points for the fund would be its ""discretion and caution"" at a time of ample innovation.  As such, the fund is structured to offer managed exposure to the emerging space, allowing investors to participate ""cautiously and intelligently.""  ICO prologue  Elsewhere in conversation, Masters gave an additional assessment of the ICO investment landscape.  In his view, the ecosystem began diversifying in May 2017, spurred by the publicity for major ransomware attacks, which he cited as driving demand for cryptocurrency payments to the point of a breakout rally.  ""Bitcoin was underperforming but was being pulled higher as the whole cryptocurrency complex exploded upward,"" Masters said.  During this time period, bitcoin saw its percentage of the total cryptocurrency market cap collapse, falling from above 90% to below 50% as investors sought exposure in less established areas of the market.  In particular, Masters said interest was driven to ethereum.  ""In a nutshell, we concluded that ethereum, and the ERC-20 tokens it spawned, were a really significant innovation in digital assets,"" he said, adding:  ""What we saw was a very rapid increase in the number and the size of these so called initial coin offerings. The ICO has taken a number of forms. Some of them are legitimate and some of them are misconstructed. It's very much a caveat emptor space.""  What makes a good ICO  From there, Masters formulated what makes for a strong ICO. (Already, his firm has directly invested in a token sale for Aventus.)  First, it calls for a team of experienced, motivated and technically savvy founders. Second, the ICO must solve a real-world problem in a way that cannot be done without the use of blockchain technology. Third, the solution should have a strong enough network effect so that its code can't be easily copied into a possible competitor.  If you have those three elements in place, according to Masters, issuing an ethereum-based token may make sense.  ""We've seen debt coins, equity coins and rail coins, which purports to transfer another coin across the ecosystem. I don't think any of those spaces are promising. What I do think are promising are new protocol coins,"" he explained.  According to Masters, token offerings and ICOs offer powerful economic incentives to entrepreneurs who are able to effectively exploit the technology.  ""It enables small- to medium-sized technology companies to leapfrog years of efforts in the management of their capital structure. You can go from a friends and family round to an angel round to Series A, to Series B, and even arguably Series C in one go,"" he said.  From the perspective of the investor, Masters said, the lure of ICOs can also prove quite powerful. ""You probably have liquidity within one week of your investment,"" he said.  On the other hand, the risks to individual investors who jump into the ICO space by themselves can also be quite significant, he said, framing this as a value-add for the fund.  He concluded:  ""The disadvantages are quite clear. Nobody is looking after you. You're on your lonesome in this one.""
