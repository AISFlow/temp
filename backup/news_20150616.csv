42426396,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJN9bh,1434491437,Bitcoin Exchange Kraken Launches New Dark Pool,"San Francisco-based digital currency exchange Kraken has launched a new dark pool for bitcoin trades.  The dark pool, which functions as an invisible order book separate from its public offering, is intended to provide a means for traders to move more than 50 BTC (roughly $12,500 at press time) on the market in relative secret.  Dark pools are used throughout the global financial system, though the practice has faced rising scrutiny from regulators, and banks have been penalized in the past for unlawful activity within the dark pools they operate. Supporters of dark pools say they help stabilize markets and reduce costs.  Kraken CEO Jesse Powell said in a recent interview that users have approached the company in the past about such a feature, noting that previously, it would manually handle large orders at customer request.  ""There’s been some people for a while going to us and saying they need to work a big trade,"" he said. ""They have a few thousand bitcoin they want to move but they don’t want to put it on the order book because they’re afraid of what that’s going to do the price and structure of the market.""  Kraken will charge an extra 0.1% on dark pool trades in addition to its standard trading fee, and is limiting access to customers with verified accounts.

42426405,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJN9xh,1434486058,Erik Voorhees: BitLicense Requires 'Reckless' Data Collection,"According to ShapeShift founder and CEO Erik Voorhees, the company’s recently launched iOS app “sailed through” the Apple App Store approval process.  “We were expecting quite a bit of pushback from Apple because there have been lots of these horror stories about bitcoin apps, you know, never getting past the bar,” he told CoinDesk. “And so we submitted it and crossed our fingers.”  Since its launch – notable for its release on an app platform known for its restrictive policy toward digital currency – the ShapeShift app has been downloaded more than 600 times, says Voorhees.  Issues with the app have been minimal, he continued, apart from a bug experienced by owners of iPhones running iOS 7.  “There was a bug with iOS 7 users which we had fixed and released updates for, so other than that little glitch everything went great,” he said.  On BitLicense’s privacy problems  ShapeShift recently made headlines after its announcement that it would cease offering services to New York residents as a result of the finalization of the BitLicense digital currency regulatory framework. In an interview with the New York Post, Voorhees described the customer data requirements imposed by the BitLicense as “Orwellian”.  New York users trying to access ShapeShift are instead directed to PleaseProtectConsumers.org, a site that protests the BitLicense framework and currently lists ShapeShift as its sole participant.  Voorhees said that the biggest issue for his company is the risk to users whose information would be collected by regulators – an arrangement that he says exposes them to hacking vulnerabilities that could result in their data being stolen and exploited.  He added:  “It would maybe be a different story if, you know, companies and governments were able to retain secure records of things. But just last week, there were 4 million accounts [compromised] on several computers – it's every couple of weeks there's a big data breach somewhere.”  “So clearly the data security industry is not sufficient enough to protect customer information,” he continued. “And so, requiring that customer information be mined from people is reckless and dangerous and puts all those people at risk.”  Looking ahead  For now, according to Voorhees, the company’s focus is on building out its functionality further and completing a still-in-progress funding round.  ""Development-wise we’re working on things that aren't super exciting for users, to get us better pricing, more functionality,” he continued.  As for the future of the protest against the BitLicense, Voorhees said he has heard from others in the bitcoin business ecosystem who are looking at taking a similar tack, noting:  “I got a couple contacts from today telling me that other bitcoin companies are basically saying they will do the same thing, block New York, but they weren’t sure when or how it would happen.”  Images via ShapeShift",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/06/16/erik-voorhees-bitlicense-requires-reckless-data-collection,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d9f15bd498a92fe1ff8f67c741dca5cc11e42a67-1272x648.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426406,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJNA1h,1434481240,Kleiner Perkins Taps Bitcoin Startup Founder for $4 Million Investment Fund,"Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, one of the oldest and most storied venture capital firms in Silicon Valley, has named a bitcoin startup founder to the staff of its new seed-stage fund.  Called the Edge Fund, the early-stage operation will provide investments of $250,000 to help selected startups with development, programming and recruiting. Targets for the $4m fund reportedly include a full range of emerging technologies including virtual reality, digital health and the blockchain.  According to The New York Times, the venture is the brainchild of Kleiner Perkins partners Anjney Midha and Mike Abbott. Its staff will include former Google product manager Ruby Lee and Roneil Rumburg, founder of the bitcoin and dogecoin transaction service Backslash.  Abbott further hinted at the strategic selection of the group's participants in conversation with The Wall Street Journal, stating:  “You want people who have backgrounds that are relevant and helpful.""  Though the announcement marks the firm's first formal move toward potential investments in bitcoin and blockchain technology, Midha has previously interviewed startups such as OneName and BlockCypher as part of a podcast series on the company's official blog.  Founded in the 1970s, Kleiner Perkins' portfolio includes investments in AOL, Amazon, Google and Intuit.  Rumburg and Kleiner Perkins did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

42426399,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJN9nh,1434470459,Reveal Raises $1.5 Million for Crypto-Powered Social Network,"Cryptocurrency-powered social network Reveal has closed $1.5m in seed funding from investors including Mike Hirshland of Resolute Ventures, Boost VC, Digital Currency Group and the Stanford StartX Fund.  Founded by Matt Ivester, former CEO of social network Kindr as well as college gossip news site JuicyCampus, and Kindr CTO Josh Beal, Reveal is perhaps best described as a visually oriented, Q&A social mobile app.  Like Instagram, SnapChat, Vine and other new social media incumbents, Reveal targets users in high school and college. Unlike these market leaders, Reveal's posts offer a unique combination of doodles, photos, video and cryptocurrency.  It's biggest asset according to its founders is reveal coin. A cryptographic token traded on the Stellar network, Ivester and Beal believe reveal coin will serve as a user engagement tool that will resonate with their target audience.  Ivester told CoinDesk:  ""For a social network, more than most other businesses, users really do contribute a tremendous amount of value by telling their friends about the network so that it grows, but then also by on a day-to-day basis contributing the content that attracts other users and keeps them coming back.""  As with past social-oriented efforts in the cryptocurrency space, reveal coin will be issued in limited quantities and distribute advertising revenue among users.  However, reveal coin also functions as a ""currency for attention"", in that consumers can use the reward token as a way to interact with others they might not otherwise know.  ""Reveal coin becomes really interesting as you can create an incentive for another user to answer your questions,"" Ivester said. ""It goes to the top of their inbox, so it's a way to get a user's attention who you might not be able to access otherwise.""  Social synergy  By creating this marketplace for attention, Ivester explained, Reveal aims to first appeal to a key audience that could perhaps earn the most from the tool – influencers on other social websites.  Ivester said that Reveal has been working with prominent Instagram and Vine users who already have a large following in hope that their incentivized Q&A format will find appeal. He continued:  ""They can say, 'If you really want to get to know me, not just see my entertaining photos or videos, come follow me on Reveal', because that's what we're really doing here. We think that that's a really great growth strategy for us.""  Reveal will also piggyback off other social networks by allowing users to earn reveal coin by inviting friends. Those who post questions, for example, will be able to advertise posted questions via Facebook, Twitter and more.  ""We think that Reveal is inherently viral and it will get a lot of growth from that,"" Ivester added.  User-first philosophy  Of note, is that Reveal's founders have chosen a community-first revenue model given that the app might have found an audience even without a token to provide an incentive.  The fact that sharing value with users might not be ""the perfect business decision"", was acknowledged by the founders. However, Ivester said it was ""the right thing to do"", suggesting that Reveal could appeal to users who feel turned off by the revenue-generating approaches of other social network giants.  ""I think we can create a better UX through this,"" Beal remarked. ""Some users are upset by ads on Facebook, they feel like it's not something that benefits them.""  As for how they will attempt to educate their audience about cryptocurrency, both Beal and Ivester indicated that they believe the concept of community ownership will be inherently understood by Reveal's audience, even if the technical details are more alien to users.  ""The nice thing about reveal coin is you don't have to have a super deep level of technical understanding to see the utility in it,"" Ivester said. ""From the consumer side, it's a clear value proposition and we're starting to educate more people about it being a cryptocurrency.""  Seeking growth  Though excited about the possibilities of reveal coin, Ivester and Beal sought to underscore their belief that the app's user experience can stand on its own.  Ivester suggested that while social networks like Reddit or Periscope will allow users to interact through questions, he called such attempts secondary to the design of the platforms.  ""Reveal is a way to showcase your personality through photos and videos. The content feels a lot more personal than these other networks. There's text, photo and video, so it feels like they're having a conversation with someone,"" he said.  Ivester indicated that Reveal will use the funds to scale its team, build an Android app and begin exploring the possibilities for the continued use of reveal coin in new ways on the network.  He concluded:  ""There's a lot more that we want to do, and this is going to allow us to do that even faster.""

42426397,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJN9dh,1434456034,Gyft Unveils New Tech for Blockchain-Powered Gift Cards,"Gyft and bitcoin API developer Chain have partnered to create Gyft Block, a trading platform aiming to make gift cards easier to exchange.  Announced at Belfast's MoneyConf, the news marks Gyft CEO Vinny Lingham's latest step in transitioning his mobile gift card company from one of bitcoin's most active merchants to a more direct supporter of its underlying technology.  Gyft Block  is part of Gyft's broader mission to digitize gift cards so that they can be securely traded using bitcoin's public ledger, the blockchain. Termed 'gift cards 2.0', the ambitious project was first revealed at SXSW in March and followed Lingham's own involvement as an advisor and investor in so-called 'crypto 2.0' firms, including Koinify and Trustatom.  A statement from Gyft implied that the platform could solve real problems for the $100bn gift card market:  ""Consumers can redeem different forms of digital value in a single transaction: for example, a consumer can buy a cup of coffee by combining a gift card, branded reward point, and coupon, since all blockchain-based digital assets operate on the same open standards.""  In an accompanying white paper, Gyft's head of special projects Guillaume Lebleu suggests Gyft Block would seek to establish a common API for gift card issuers that more closely replicates those of credit and debit networks.  New white paper  Lebleu's follow-up provides an overview of the technological building blocks on which gift cards have been based, and how Gyft believes migrating these attributes to the blockchain could be beneficial.  ""Credit and debit cards require a standard infrastructure between thousands of financials institutions and millions of merchants ... A gift card, on the other hand, is a singular instrument typically redeemed only with the merchant who issued it,"" he explains.  In the post, Lebleu goes on to describe the ways in which Gyft Block will allow providers to issue gift cards on the blockchain that can be programmatically compliant with local laws.  For example, multisig technology would allow the keys to a bitcoin wallet for a gift card asset to be distributed among multiple parties including the issuer, the cardholder and a third-party to help enforce necessary rules.  ""The co-signing program manager is trusted to enforce the terms and regulations of the assets, including daily spending limits and unauthorized transfers, by rejecting any non-compliant transactions,"" he continues.  The costs of issuing gift cards on the blockchain are also favorable to the cost of printing plastic gift cards, Lebleu says.  His post concludes:  ""Ultimately, intelligent wallets will be able to connect to marketplaces, identify arbitrage opportunities and perform in the background complex chains of trade that maximizes the consumer’s purchasing power without compromising their privacy or control.""

42426401,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJN9ph,1434453322,Santander: Blockchain Tech Can Save Banks $20 Billion a Year,"Blockchain technologies could reduce banks' infrastructural costs by $15-20bn a year by 2022, a new report from Santander InnoVentures claims.  The FinTech 2.0 Paper, produced in collaboration with Oliver Wyman and Anthemis Group, says distributed ledger technology could save banks money by eliminating central authorities and bypassing slow, expensive payment networks.  Beyond payments, its authors identify other areas of potential for distributed ledgers, noting:    ""In time, distributed ledgers will support 'smart contracts' – computer protocols that verify or enforce contracts. This will lead to a wide variety of potential uses in securities, syndicated lending, trade finance, swaps, derivatives or wherever counterparty risk arises.""              Blockchain technology could also increase investor confidence in products whose underlying assets are opaque or where property rights are made uncertain by the role of central authorities, the report says.      Other ""attractive features"" of the technology include transaction irreversibility, near-instantaneous clearing and settlement and a reduced margin of error, as individual transactions are openly verified by a community of network users.      ""Commercial banks, central banks, stock exchanges and major technology providers, such as IBM and Samsung, are all exploring the potential uses of distributed ledgers [...] It is only a matter of time before distributed ledgers become a trusted alternative for managing large volumes of transactions.""              The publication of the report follows Santander InnoVentures managing principal Mariano Belinky's statement at the FutureMoney conference that distributed ledgers have the potential to ""transform"" banking as we know it.    Speaking to CoinDesk in April, Belinky claimed bitcoin's underlying technology would gain mainstream traction sooner than the digital currency itself.  Blockchain trend  Santander InnoVentures' report on blockchain tech is the latest contribution to what is considered to be a growing trend among mainstream banks.  Just last month, the Euro Banking Association (EBA), released a report which stated that distributed ledgers had the potential to lower costs, increase speed and improve product offerings.  Similarly to Santander's report, the EBA publication highlighted that cooperation among Payment Service Providers (PSPs) and the crypto community was necessary as it would determine the future relationship between traditional banks and the '2.0' sector.

42426394,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJN9Vh,1434428181,Bitcoin Mining Pool BTC Guild to Close Over BitLicense Concerns,"UPDATE (16th June 16:00 BST): Following the publication of this article, a spokesperson for the New York State Department of Financial Services told CoinDesk ""miners and mining pools are exempt from the BitLicense"".      BTC Guild is set to close at the end of June, months after previously announcing that it would shut down its long-running bitcoin mining pool.  In its announcement, posted to Bitcoin Talk, owner Eleuthria cited the finalization of the BitLicense as a primary motivator for shutting down, stating that BTC Guild could not afford any legal threats that may arise as a result of the New York regulatory framework.  The pool announced last October that it was considering closure in the face of falling revenue and rising risks for both users and the pool itself. BTC Guild first floated the idea in July 2014, citing the then-incomplete BitLicense at the time.  Eleuthria noted that whether BTC Guild is based in New York ""does not matter"" and suggested that the pool could face significant legal liability regardless of its location because ""the final regulations have enough gray area that BTC Guild is at risk"".  The post explained:  ""This fact makes it possible for New York to attempt to claim jurisdiction to enforce regulations. Whether or not BTC Guild could win in defense of such an attempt is irrelevant, since the cost of defending the pool would be greater than any income the pool is expected to generate going forward.""  BTC Guild will cease operating after 30th June, with withdrawals available until 30th September.  The mining pool – a collective of miners who share their hashing power to compete for blocks as a group – has reduced its minimum withdrawal amount to 0.0001 BTC, with no transaction fees required to remove money from the platform.  BitLicense, fraud risk blamed  In addition to the BitLicense finalization, the gradual decline in size of the pool relative to its costs and liabilities was cited as a factor in the closure decision.  Eleuthria wrote:  ""As mining has become more centralized, BTC Guild has continuously shrunk in proportion to the network, now being less than 3% of the network hash rate. The costs of running the pool have not changed, and the amount of funds at risk in the event of a compromise is significantly higher than what the pool could ever recover from.""  The announcement pointed to the growing risk of fraud BTC Guild allegedly faces, with Eleuthria stating that ""I have been growing concerned for some time now about attempts to defraud pools.""  ""When the pool was 20-30% of the network, the amount of funds at risk was slightly higher, but the ability for the pool to recover from that loss was present,"" Eleuthria wrote. ""At 3% of the network, the pool would not be able to recover from such a loss.""  Sale cancelled  In its last announcement, BTC Guild floated the possibility of a sale in order to continue operating. According to the latest post, any idea of a sale was abandoned due to the perceived risk of fraud, as well as ""personal attachment"" to the pool on the part of its staff.  ""The risk of users being cheated or stolen from as a result of transferring pool ownership is not something I am willing to accept,"" Eleuthria wrote, reiterating that the decision to shut down is in part an effort to protect users from fraud.  Eleuthria went on to thank the community for its support of BTC Guild, which began operating in 2011, writing:  ""Thank you to all the users and the Bitcoin community for making BTC Guild a success for the last four years. It has been hard to finally make this call a second time with the determination to not reverse the decision.""
