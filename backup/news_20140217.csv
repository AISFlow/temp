42425442,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyI1rLh,1392679322,"After Massive Hack, It's Pay Back Time for Silk Road 2.0","Online black market Silk Road 2.0 has announced via reddit that it will forego paying its staff until it reimburses users for the more than 4,000 BTC that was compromised last week.  The massive loss is said to be the work of enterprising hackers, who exploited bitcoin's ongoing transaction malleability issues to steal funds from the site, though other, more colorful theories abound.  Silk Road 2.0 moderator Defcon issued a seven-point repayment plan to the community yesterday. Effective 15th February, the proposal reaffirmed his outlet's commitment to its merchants and clientele, and was open to user feedback.  Said Defcon:  ""We are committed to getting everyone repaid even if it takes a year.""  In addition, Defcon moved to downplay persisting rumors that the theft was an inside job, writing:  ""We are deep into the investigation of data surrounding the attacks, and it there is absolutely zero evidence of any staff member being involved.""  He went on to suggest that Silk Road 2.0 is still looking out for the alleged thieves, and that he will provide updates as the search progresses.  Renewed commitment  Defcon also released new data on the breach, suggesting that it affected 26% of the site's monthly active users, and that this figure represents 47% of its total user base. Because of the large-scale nature of the theft, Defcon was openly apologetic and understanding to vendors who may not return as a result of the negative experience.  ""You are welcomed and encouraged to vend on multiple markets,"" he wrote. ""I only trust myself, and will not endorse any of them. But I have failed you. Wherever you vend, may you prosper.""  In addition to allowing its moderators to go without payment, the site will no longer use a centralized escrow service. It will also begin providing a support queue for affected users and charge 5% commissions on purchases, with proceeds going toward reimbursing victims.  Vendors will have the option to put even more funds toward the cause, presenting a ""Donate"" box that can be added to customer shopping carts.  Community reaction  Though there were users who lauded the comprehensive response, the tenor of the conversation suggested that Silk Road 2 has taken a repetitional hit from the breach. Some were open about their decision to leave the marketplace, while others opted for a wait-and-see approach.  Certainly, those who want to pursue other avenues for obtaining illegal goods do have additional options, whether from Black Market Reloaded, though this sites, too, has faced operational issues, as well as increased scrutiny from law enforcement in the US and abroad.  Still, if figures from Defcon are to be believed, inbound traffic to Silk Road is increasing, as its greatest asset, its brand, continues to gain notoriety, despite setbacks. The post indicates that February's registration totals have already surpassed those observed in January.

42425437,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyI1rDh,1392667962,Ukraine to Regulate Bitcoin Businesses Under Existing Laws,"In response to queries from Ukraine-based news source AIN.UA, the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) has issued its first formal legal guidance to its native bitcoin community.  Most notably, the NBU has indicated that bitcoin payment systems and payment infrastructure services must register with the agency and abide by existing laws related to the management of electronic money.  The announcement positions Ukraine closer to the European Union than Russia on matters of virtual currency regulation, even as Russia has moved to solidify its influence over the former USSR member state on the national stage.  Russia abruptly banned bitcoin earlier this year, in what has been one of the more hostile reactions to the emerging technology.  Indeed, Russia's reaction was a topic of conversation in message board posts related to the newspaper's announcement, suggesting fears Ukraine could adopt a similar stance were prevalent prior to the news.  Existing laws  The topic of whether bitcoin businesses necessitate unique laws is being debated around the world, and as such, Ukraine's decision to use existing laws gives it a unique position on the global stage.  AIN.UA published the full comments it obtained from the NBU, which amount to a few paragraphs of direction, as well as a link to an existing payment systems and money laundering law - ""On Payment Systems and Funds Transfer in Ukraine"" - which lies at the center of the new guidance.  Pursuant to Article 9 of the law, the NBU stated that bitcoin businesses have the right to perform services only after registering with the government, suggesting that those that have not are in violation of current law.  Article 9  also requires payment service providers to:  Enact a procedure for settling instances when it fails to perform services  Establish an organizational structure and formal channels to resolve member disputes  Provide information about the transfer of money to enhance consumer protection.  Further, the NBU cited Article 15 of the Act, which requires those with ""the intention to issue electronic money"" to coordinate rules for its use consistent with current regulation.  Impact  Roman Skaskiw, an American bitcoin enthusiast living in Ukraine, suggested that the new guidance may limit growth and innovation in the European nation.  Said Skaskiw:  ""I think it's ridiculous. Because property rights are so weak in Ukraine, software has been one of the few opportunities Ukrainians have been able to realize.""  Skaskiw described Ukraine as having ""world-class programmers"", but said that there is ""very little in the way of a community"" around bitcoin. To further encourage this growth, Skaskiw suggests that Ukraine should strive to create a permissive environment for virtual currency.  The news also comes amid statements from bitcoin thought leaders that suggest Ukraine could be a key market for bitcoin.    States (like UK, US, Ukraine, Turkey, Greece, Thailand, etc.) are flammable. Bitcoin is not. Your fiat is flammable. BTC is not.      — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) January 25, 2014    The latest warning  While NBU officials did provide some legal clarifications for the wider virtual currency community, they also followed in the footsteps of other European nations that have issued warnings to citizens regarding bitcoin's price volatility and lack of consumer protections.  Said the bank:  ""We emphasize that all the risks associated with the use of so-called ... cryptocurrency ... bear calculations.""    With the statement, Ukraine joins Cyprus, Estonia, Greece and Kazakhstan among the European and Asian nations that have recently decided to increase consumer awareness of the risks of virtual currencies.

42425430,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyI1r3h,1392663789,"Bitcoin ATM Pioneer Plans Machines for Singapore, London","The company behind the world’s first bitcoin ATM is planning to set up machines in London and Singapore by mid-March.  Vancouver-based Bitcoiniacs, said the new machines are part of a global expansion that will also include setting up physical brokerage offices for retail customers and a push to increase use of its own bitcoin exchange.  Bitcoiniacs founder Mitchell Demeter said the ATMs would likely be located inside a cafe or coffee shop, with a brokerage office attached. This would be similar to its current set-up in Vancouver, where the ATM is located in Waves Coffee House.  “We’re currently looking for a location. We’ve got a gentleman on the ground in Singapore that we’ve been working with. We’re likely going to do a similar set-up to what we have here in Vancouver,” Demeter said.  The ATMs going to London and Singapore are Robocoin models. Bitcoiniacs currently operates a Robocoin machine in Vancouver as well.  Demeter said Singapore is a prime target for the company’s expansion plans because of the country’s clear rules on the taxation of bitcoin.  “[Singapore] became very attractive to us as soon as [the authorities] made it clear where they stood on bitcoin. It’s an attractive location for business overall, so it was the perfect location.""  Diversifying services  The new ATMs are being deployed as Bitcoiniacs renews its push to promote its own exchange, Cointraderhttps://www.cointrader.net/about. All Bitcoiniacs machines will be connected to Cointrader, which is billed as an exchange for ATM operators. The firm decided to set up its own exchange after it faced a large number of unprocessed transactions with Bitstamp.  Demeter said his firm’s original plan was to build a network of brokerages and ATMs around the world, initially relying on external exchanges. But, he said the big exchanges currently provide an unsatisfactory level of customer support.  “We quickly realised we could provide better service to our customers if we owned our exchange platform. Then we’re not at the mercy of [external] exchanges.""  Bitcoiniacs’ brokerage offices work in tandem with the firm’s ATMs. According to Demeter, the offices are popular with first-time bitcoin buyers who want their questions answered by someone in person. The brokerage offices also allow bitcoin sellers to collect cash immediately, instead of waiting for their funds to be withdrawn from an exchange account.  “For a lot of people we’re the first contact they have with bitcoin. A lot of people do research online but they don’t have anyone physically to talk to. A lot of people find that a huge advantage,” he said.  Race to market  Bitcoiniacs will have competition in the ATM space in both London and Singapore. A firm called Bitcoin Exchange plans to set up a Lamassu ATM, which only performs fiat-to-bitcoin conversions, in the Southeast Asian city-state by April. An ATM in Hong Kong, also a Robocoin unit, was announced for a January installation, but no further updates about it have been published. Therefore, the Bitcoiniacs machine could beat it to become the first bitcoin ATM in Asia.  In London, three startups are vying to install the city’s first bitcoin ATM, with units from both Lamassu and Robocoin. One of the firms could have its unit installed this week, its founder told CoinDesk, although he has not confirmed the date yet.

42425436,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyI1r7h,1392659811,Thai Bitcoin Exchange Reopens But Legal Standing Still Unclear,"Thailand-based bitcoin exchange Bitcoin Co LTDhttps://bitcoin.co.th/en/ has formally resumed services after receiving a letter on 31st Januaryhttps://bitcoin.co.th/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/BoT-Greenlight.pdf from the Bank of Thailand (BoT) clearing the company for bitcoin trading.  BoT officials had previously stated that such activity was illegal under Thai law, an announcement that forced Bitcoin Co LTD to reposition itself as a bitcoin mining equipment reseller.  David Barnes, managing director of Bitcoin Co LTD, confirmed the news to CoinDesk, saying that the company restarted exchange services on 15th February:  “After we received an update from the Bank of Thailand, we decided it was appropriate to restart our business, which had been on hold since August 2013.”  Despite the company’s lengthy absence from the market, Barnes said that trading volumes have already returned to 2013 levels. “It’s about in line with, or a slight improvement from, where we left off in July,” he said.  Yet, while the bank letter has been heralded as a change in bitcoin’s legal status in the Asian nation, the full picture is still not clear.  Frankie Bishop, a representative from the Facebook group Bitcoin Thailand, suggested that, whatever headlines result from the news, the situation on the ground remains largely unchanged.  “The Bank of Thailand did not change their regulation,” he said. “All they did was affirm what was correct the whole time, that it was out of their scope of regulation.”  Premature shutdown?  The announcement, for the moment, overturns previous guidance from Thailand's Foreign Exchange Administration and Policy Department that had been widely interpreted as a bitcoin ban.  The agencies had told Bitcoin Co Ltd that it was illegal to buy or sell bitcoins, exchange bitcoins for goods or services, or send and receive bitcoins outside of Thailand in an early hearing on the matter. That guidance caused the company to abruptly suspend operations with no timetable for a return.  “Based on such a broad and encompassing advisement,” the company wrote last year, “Bitcoin Co Ltd therefore has no choice but to suspend operations until such as time that the laws in Thailand are updated to account for the existence of bitcoin.”  Bishop, however, suggests that Bitcoin Co Ltd may have been premature in the decision to pull its services, and indicated that he has been actively downplaying the misconception that bitcoin had been banned in Thailand:  “The ban was solely based on what was ‘verbally’ communicated during that hearing.”  “Now, correct me if I’m wrong,” he continued, “but have you ever heard of any regulation being set by any government without any sort of formal procedure, and or follow-up hearings, to make proper regulatory determination with anything? And, to apply it formally with officials signing off on it? I think not.”  Bishop went on to say that, in the interim, the local community has traded bitcoin through online venues such as OKPAY and LocalBitcoins.com – which, he stated, were “never blocked”, despite the Thai government’s sometimes aggressive internet controls.  However, the widespread reports of the ban “seriously deterred” new users from getting involved, he said, adding, “The loss is incalculable, I'm afraid to say.”  Looking for guidance  Translations obtained by BitLegal suggest that the letter was a formal response to Bitcoin Co Ltd’s request for regulatory clarity on its ability to do business in Thailand, which was issued last June.  Though Bitcoin Co Ltd could possibly have continued business had it not sought oversight, without legal clarification, Barnes said, the company would have had difficulty obtaining financing from the corporate-level banking institutions that it believed it needed for growth.  Notably, the BoT has not changed any of its existing regulations per the company’s request. The most important thing to take away from the letter may be statements suggesting that bitcoin does not qualify as a “foreign currency”, however.  The BoT said that Bitcoin Co Ltd, and by extension other exchanges, do not need a permit for operations provided there is no sale of foreign currency on the exchange.  “If the bitcoin that the company allows to be exchanged into Thai baht [...] can also be used to exchange into other foreign currency inside or outside of Thailand, without the company being able to stop these exchanges,” Marc Nickels from BitLegal explained, “then the company may fall within the guidelines that would [require] a permit.”  Looking forward  Despite the step forward in relations between the BoT and Bitcoin Co Ltd, reaction to bitcoin at the bank remains mixed, Barnes said.  “Most individuals at the bank seemed very interested in bitcoin and intrigued to hear more; a few individuals seemed quite hostile to the concept,” he said.  Furthermore, Barnes doesn’t see the BoT expending any more effort on the subject anytime soon:  “I don't expect BoT to spend much more time on the issue, as at present bitcoin usage in Thailand is simply not big enough to require their resources.”  Still, both Bishop and BitLegal suggest a verbal understanding may not be the best outcome for bitcoin.  “It seems like the exchange is on decent footing,” Nickel concluded. “Except that what they didn’t say in the press release is that there could be some law or regulation that pulls the rug out from under them at any time. Essentially, no guarantees.”  Bishop also had his doubts that the letter constituted any form of legal clarification:  “I mean, seriously, this thing has been so ridiculous – and now people are saying that bitcoin is legal because of one letter, written by someone at the BOT, sent to a prospective exchange operator? Please...”  Barnes, however, sees it as a positive for the local ecosystem, saying that the announcement is likely to spur involvement in bitcoin trading and convince more businesses to begin conducting trade out in the open, at least for now.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/17/thai-bitcoin-exchange-reopens-but-legal-standing-still-unclear,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/94adc417535b12b10a6867a979b1c0f7785f725b-1193x704.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425441,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyI1rJh,1392657345,Dogecoin Founder Turns Down $500k Investment Offer,"Dogecoin Founder Jackson Palmer has turned down a substantial investment offer from a group of Australian venture capitalists. Palmer was apparently offered $500,000, but he told Techly he turned down the offer. When asked why, he simply said: “because f*** that”.  Although dogecoin started off as an elaborate joke, the actual model is a lot more interesting than the hair-down meme image of this altcoin. There is no artificial cap on how many coins can be mined, as the cap is increased by five million units each year.  “It’s a deflationary/inflationary model I like to jokingly call ‘dogeflation’,” Palmer said. “We’re trying to stabilise ourselves and get it to a point where it can be treated as a viable currency.”  Bitcoin types are elitists, doge is for everyone  Palmer points out that people will not be using dogecoins to buy yachts and cars – but they could use it for microtransactions based off social media. Such transactions could allow internet communities to support media outlets, artists and various content creators.  He also took a swipe at some members of the bitcoin community, describing bitcoin enthusiasts as an “elitist little group” that doesn’t like outsiders, while dogecoin is more of a grassroots thing.  “You can go to a Bitcoin meet up and meet people who are like ‘I have 100 bitcoins, I’m a multimillionaire’,” he said.“Dogecoin is the community’s currency, open to everyone, and that’s how I want to keep it.”  Even dogecoin needs regulation  Although Palmer wants to keep dogecoin open to anyone, even if he has to turn down heaps of cash to keep it independent, he is in favour of some form of regulation. Palmer explains in a rather humorous fashion:  “I’ve been approached by VCs lately who want to cash in on this Dogecoin thing and they’re offering me what in reality is ridiculous amounts of money. And I’m sitting there quietly with them saying ‘I want to throw X amount of dollars at this’ and I’m like, ‘take a step back, it’s a dog on a coin’. Has the world gone mad?”  As if his remarks about bitcoin elitists weren’t enough, Palmer also went out of his way to irk all those who are not in favour of any crypo regulation. He is an avid advocate of regulation and he believes the Australian government needs to regulate and legitimise digital currencies.  “I do ultimately think we need to regulate around this stuff otherwise you will not gain the trust of the average Joe who wants to put $100 into whatever digital currency they’re using,” he said.  Palmer also praised the Canadian government for its decision to regulate cryptocurrencies.

42425434,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyI1r5h,1392653457,Why Mt. Gox May Be Headed for Bankruptcy,"Ezra Galston is currently a venture capitalist at Chicago Ventures and the former director of marketing for CardRunners Gaming.  It has been a tough week for bitcoin: a freeze on withdrawals at Mt. Gox due to transaction malleability, multiple DDoS attacks across the exchanges, and a consequent plunge in price.  In my view, however, Gox should be everyone’s biggest focus. While their price spreads and cash-out delays have plagued the site for more than six months, I believe their current situation and recent statements belie transparency and suggest insolvency. Namely, that their business model and recent past raise a number of red flags that make comparing the company to now-bankrupt online gambling operators highly relevant.  Three weeks ago, I took to Re/code to describe how the evolution of online poker is likely to be correlated and instructive to bitcoin’s development. In it, I wrote: “I believe we could see a major exchange go under, especially if regulations and wire transfers become more complex, or if the cost of acquiring customers becomes more competitive.”  I have seen this story play out nearly a dozen times before during my tenure as an executive in the online poker world and, in this article, I want to set out why I think Mt. Gox is in big trouble.  Fund seizures  Mt. Gox had nearly $5 million in funds seized from its bank accounts in 2013. It’s unclear whether these were operating funds or customer deposits. This is highly reminiscent of seizures in the online gambling world, which deeply affected operators’ solvency.  These fund seizures, such as $115 Million from Full Tilt Poker, or $33 Million in a 2009 DOJ Seizure, were initially smoothed over by their operators. Players were typically reimbursed and withdrawals were honored.  What outsiders hadn’t realized at the time was the strain this placed on individual operators. In order to keep the business running, operators had to remove the ring-fence that protected customer deposits and borrow from customer balances to support operations.  While everyone believed that the poker sites were making billions, their overheads due to staffing and marketing was significant. More importantly, each new seizure forced the operators to move downstream to less and less reputable transaction processors and banks. These processors charged heavier fees because of the heightened risk, and often absconded with deposits, because, well, they could.  We see this with Mt. Gox as well: the company lost its relationship with reputable processors, such as Dwolla, and has never managed to integrate with Skrill or Neteller.  Phantom deposits  It appears that Mt. Gox has long known of, and suffered from, transaction malleability. As explained in this Coindesk post, if a user claimed not to have received their bitcoin (either truthfully or maliciously), Gox was likely to have re-sent the funds to avoid negative press as a result.  This process of fronting money – either in the hopes of recovering the initial transactions or to maintain positive perceptions – is a vicious cycle that depends on deposits outpacing withdrawals to be sustainable. Once that balance reverts, it’s an effective bank run, and the operator will eventually not have enough deposits to cover user balances.  It is highly analogous to the working capital model that caused the insolvency of Full Tilt Poker, once a billion-dollar industry leader. In their case, the black market ACH (automated clearing house) processors they had contracted to transfer player funds from bank account to virtual wallet struggled to convince banks to process those transactions.  Full Tilt, wanting to maintain a dominant image and not lose player liquidity to competitors, chose to credit attempted(but failed) withdrawals to player accounts, hoping to recoup those transactions as their processors improved. This backlog of ‘phantom’ deposits ultimately reached $130 million. Executives later admitted that it started small and spiraled out of control.  Although I have not seen any indication as to the scale of Gox’s equivalent phantom transactions, the ramifications are considerable – especially if malicious customers exploited the issue to their advantage.  Excuses, excuses...  Mt. Gox’s public statements have been only partially accurate, initially blaming bank/processor delays in June 2013, and now admitting a systemic technical issue. This evolution of excuses mirrors those of gambling operators who were quick to blame a difficultly in transaction processing before admitting internal issues.  Eurolinx was a popular poker site from 2006 to 2008. However, in 2009, withdrawals began slowing considerably. Initially, it claimed:  “The situation is only temporary because we have had an unusually high number of withdrawals that, in combination with increased security checks, have caused a backlog and delays throughout the system.”  Weeks later they admitted: “Most of the delays occurred due to payment processor issues we experienced in May and June. The problem has now been fixed, however, we have some withdrawal backlog to deal with.” And, months later, they filed for bankruptcy – leaving players millions of dollars the poorer – and ultimately admitting that they gambled player deposits in the stock market and lost, big time.  FullTiltPoker enjoyed market dominance from late 2006 until their DOJ indictment in April 2011. Soon after being banned from servicing US players, the DOJ gave them permission to repay all depositors, but they failed to do so.  On May 15th, FTP claimed: “Full Tilt Poker faced numerous challenges and hurdles to ensuring the smooth operation of its international business and the orderly return of US player funds. We are absolutely committed to making sure that US players are refunded as soon as possible. We apologize for the delay and the fact that we underestimated the time it would take to work through these issues.”  On May 30th, they repeated:  “We still do not have a specific timeframe for [paying back players]. There has been, and remains, no bigger priority than getting US players paid as soon as possible, and we have been working around the clock to get this done.”  However, at this point, they admitted solvency issues for the first time, saying: “We are raising capital to ensure that the US players are paid out in full as quickly as possible.” The company admitted total insolvency three months later, on August 31st.  In these cases and more, the operators cited seemingly legitimate reasons for process delays. All were rooted in industry truths – difficulty of bank processing or technical complications of implementing a mass refund – but were ultimately covers for deeper issues.  Most worrisome is that in the weeks prior to nearly every major online poker bankruptcy, the operators marketed deposit bonuses and perks – a last attempt to buy solvency and time.  This was true in the case of Full Tilt Poker and Eurolinx, as well as Ultimate Bet, Absolute Poker, GoalWin Poker, Poker in Venice and more. Mt. Gox did the same – offering discounted trading fees as recently as December 19thhttps://www.mtgox.com/press_release_20131219.html – a curious move for an operator clearly aware they were facing transactional hurdles.  Tell-tale pattern  I am hopeful, along with the wider Bitcoin community, that Mt. Gox can overcome its difficulties and rebuild consumer confidence.  As Mt. Gox has struggled with both bitcoin and fiat withdrawals, it should be noted that, in a public ledger cryptocurrency, it is possible to certify the solvency of reserves with digital signatures showing the location of all deposits – although no exchange currently utilizes this feature of bitcoin.  While that would solve questions surrounding bitcoin solvency, it would leave fiat concerns unresolved. That said, my experience over the past decade has shown that insolvency tends to follow a pattern, that Mt. Gox clearly fits, and I feel the company is likely to fail unless outside capital comes to the rescue.

The exchange, which launched its service last August, can now count bitcoin luminaries Erik Voorhees and Roger Ver among its investors.  Safello  , which also saw Blockchain.info CEO Nicolas Cary invest, is currently revamping its website, and promises a range of new services in the coming months.  The startup has worked hard to establish credibility in the fledgling bitcoin exchange market, signing deals with at least two major banks, and also negotiating with the Swedish regulator – the Financial Supervisory Authority.  The company, which set up the first bitcoin ATM in Sweden, shares the bitcoin market in that country with three other exchanges: btcx.se, Kapiton, and FYB-SE. It said in a statement, however, that it wants to focus on the broader European market “as a first step to globalisation”.  The firm did not provide details of what its new services might be, but it’s worth noting that one of the new investors is Henrik von Schoultz, founder of Mosync – a platform enabling developers to produce mobile applications for a variety of platforms.  Bitcoin angels  Other investors in this latest around include Ira Miller, the CTO of Coinapult, and Jan Rees, an expert in retail banking and card payments.  Also investing were Anders Bruzelius, the former head of equity research at Swedbank – Sweden’s largest bank in terms of customer numbers – and Victor & Victor, angel investors in casino Vera&John, which recently became the first licenced online casino to begin accepting bitcoins.  This investment round also sees a recommitment by Ludvig Öberg, an early angel investor in Safello, who, like Roger Ver, is listed as an advisor on the firm’s site.  Aside from the amount invested, this investment round is also notable for the number of investors involved. The firm lists 15 in its statement announcing the deal, which would mean an average of $40,000 each (although the investment is likely to be unevenly spread).  The large number of contributors may be down to the way in which Safello engineered the round via DealCircle, a Danish startup that offers to make it easier for angel investors and startup founders to make deals.  Finding investors in this way offers the advantage of reducing the legal fees involved in organising angel investments, and DealCircle itself secured $750,000 in funding just last week.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/17/investors-pump-600k-into-swedish-bitcoin-exchange-safello,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2d6902414ba5103ca355082f9b5622f4f74e55de-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

He started writing about bitcoin with a piece on BitInstant for CNNMoney in August 2012 and went on to write about the digital currency for Entrepreneur.com and other titles, including two pieces for the New Yorker online.  “[Bitcoin] is such a big subject that it deserves a comprehensive book-length account that will stand the test of time,” Eha said in the press release.  Eha’s book has been acquired by Portfolio, a business book imprint of Penguin Random House. Portfolio publishes 65 titles a year. Titles in its stable include The Smartest Guys in the Room by Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind, The Search by John Batelle, and several titles by marketing guru Seth Godin.  Penguin Random House controls 26% of the global publishing market. It was formed in July 2013 after a merger between Bertelsmann’s Random House and Pearson’s Penguin Books. Bertelsmann now owns the majority of the combined entity.

42425440,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyI1rHh,1392636846,Mt. Gox: Bitcoin Withdrawals Will Resume Soon,"Mt. Gox  has issued an official statement saying it has found a workaround for its bitcoin transaction malleability problems, which will see bitcoin withdrawals resume ""soon"". This comes after the team worked over the weekend to begin implementation of a new transaction system.  It said the workaround was ""thanks to our friends at Blockchain.info"", with Blockchain's Andreas Antonopoulos and Ben Reeves ""working like crazy"" over the past week to help the company get things stabilized again. While some might regard the two as Mt. Gox's rivals, it is another example of different interests within the bitcoin economy teaming up for the good of the cause.  As expected, when withdrawals recommence they will do so ""at a moderated pace and with new daily/monthly limits in place"" to prevent a run that could put too much strain on the company's resources.  The statement said:    ""We apologize for the inconvenience caused by the recent suspension of external bitcoin transfers. Fortunately, as we announced on Saturday we have now implemented a solution that should enable withdrawals and mitigate any issues caused by transaction malleability (please see our previous statements for details on this issue.      Thanks to our friends at Blockchain.info, MtGox now has a workaround that will use a unique identiﬁer created by Blockchain to show whether transactions have been modiﬁed or not. This will prevent any fraudulent use of the malleability issue and protect the assets of our customers.""    Implementing the workaround involved re-indexing the entire bitcoin block chain with its 32 million entries, fully deploying the new NTX ID, and implementing a new bitcoin withdrawal queue that would need to be tested before withdrawals could begin. Mt. Gox also implemented new security measures, including email notification for users after logging in.  The latest statement is a little different in tone to previous Mt. Gox statements, apologizing for delays and promising a new update ""by Thursday at the latest"", suggesting the company has realized the importance of clear communication with its users.  Bitstamp, another of the 'Big Three' bitcoin exchanges, has already allowed withdrawals to begin again after experiencing problems due to the transaction malleability issue.  Protests continue  The small but determined protest outside Mt. Gox's Tokyo office continued over the weekend and into Monday, with visitors reportedly dropping by from different parts of the world to join in.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcUBB6jHzmk  Original protestor Kolin Burges claimed he had spoken to a Mt. Gox representative but was still not 100% satisfied the dispute could be resolved to his satisfaction, unless all withdrawals could begin again without holdup. Local trader and bitcoin entrepreneur 'Aaron' said he hoped for a meaningful solution, but had personal doubts Mt. Gox could actually deliver all the bitcoins its users supposedly held in their wallets.  So far, there has been no proof or official indication that Mt. Gox does not control all the bitcoins it claims to, and the company maintains its withdrawal suspension is due to technical problems caused by the bitcoin protocol's transaction malleability bug, an issue that was first documented in 2011.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TRADING,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/17/mt-gox-bitcoin-withdrawals-will-resume-soon,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c3333ee3c8e11aa54b51fb9a30f71f672bd35cbb-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425448,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyI1rXh,1392632416,South Korean Exchange Coinplug Launches Country's First Bitcoin Apps,"Coinplug, the South Korean bitcoin exchange and merchant software developer, has released three apps for Android devices that include a bitcoin wallet, a trading app, and a POS system for merchants. They are the first mobile bitcoin apps available in Korean.  The company's website also now features a map to find merchants accepting bitcoin and using its POS software. Maps will be updated daily to include any new businesses, which Coinplug also supplies with Korean-language 'bitcoin accepted here' window signs.  Coinplug has developed its own native payment processing software, currently deployed by a majority of Korea's bitcoin-accepting businesses. Promising ""financial institution-level security"", it allows merchants to transact without using payment processors.  The wider-known Coinmap.org shows at least 12 businesses in the Seoul-Incheon area alone that accept bitcoin, and it is an eclectic mix ranging from cafes and cocktail bars to medical clinics and beauty salons (one of which also offers wedding consulting).  Coinplug's user map (the far-right link on the blue title bar) offers a different selection of businesses to Coinmap, covering a wider geographic area and showing only those using Coinplug's software – but which still looks quite impressive.  Coinplug's app is Android-only and available in the international Google Play store. Rival iOS's bitcoin-phobia is much less of an issue in South Korea, where Android has a 93% share of the smartphone market and Apple just 5.1%. This is due partly to local manufacturer Samsung's home-ground advantage, and a lack of company-owned Apple stores in South Korea.  South Korea's bitcoin community is growing steadily. There are at least two native exchanges, Coinplug and Korbit, plus fixed-price exchange Bitcoins.co.kr. Kraken has a Korean office and offers Korean as its only non-English language option.  Coinplug in Korea  Coinplug started in June 2013 and officially launched in December to target the Korean and neighboring Asian markets. In November it received $400,000 in seed funding from Silicon Valley newcomer Silverblue, Inc., half in bitcoin and half in cash, which it used to develop its apps and trading platform.  It has a team of over 17 employees with plenty of mobile experience. Founder and CEO Ryan Uhr also founded mobile location-based services firm Celizion, and was chief technology officer at San Jose wireless company Exio Communications, which Cisco Systems acquired for $165m in 2000.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/17/south-korean-exchange-coinplug-launches-countrys-first-bitcoin-apps,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/38d0266327cdbeb5fcf0a1251c670f59476f5afe-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
