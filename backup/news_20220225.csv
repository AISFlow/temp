42375250,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw6ez7,1645833096,US Sanctions Russian President Vladimir Putin,"The U.S., European Union and U.K. are all adding Russian President Vladimir Putin to their respective sanctions lists in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  Calling the move ""a rare step,"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said during a briefing on Friday that it would target Putin's finances, as well as bar him from travel to the U.S. This is the third tranche of sanctions announced against Russia since it began invading Ukraine earlier this week.  ""Following a television telephone conversation President [Joe] Biden held with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and in alignment with the decision by our European allies, the United States will join them in sanctioning President Putin and Foreign Minister [Sergei] Lavrov and members of the Russian national security team. I expect we'll have more specific details out later this afternoon,"" Psaki said.  Psaki demurred when asked about details, saying those would be discussed when the sanctions are formally unveiled. She did say that the U.S.' sanctions are in line with similar efforts made by the European Commission.  A Treasury Department press release published later said any property belonging to a sanctioned individual that is held within the U.S. would be seized, but did not specify if any such property had already been identified.  ""We are working in close coordination and lockstep with our European counterparts ... The shared hope is they will have significant economic and financial consequences,"" Psaki said.  Psaki later announced on Twitter the Treasury Department would also add sanctions against the Russian Direct Investment Fund, Russia's de facto sovereign wealth fund.  The U.S. has already added several of Russia's largest banks to its sanctions list, seizing assets held in the U.S. and blocking these institutions from interacting with the U.S. financial sector. Reciprocating sanctions enacted by the U.K. and EU will enforce similar bans.  These countries have also announced they will seize assets belonging to individuals with close ties to the Russian president.

42375240,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw6erZ,1645831962,US Justice Department Indicts BitConnect Founder,"The U.S. Department of Justice announced Friday that a federal grand jury charged BitConnect founder Satish Kumbhani with defrauding investors of some $2.4 billion through its lending scheme.  Kumbhani was charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to commit price manipulation, operating an unlicensed money transmitter and conspiracy to launder funds internationally for ""orchestrating a global Ponzi scheme"" according to a DOJ press release, which alleged he traded cryptocurrencies using his investors' funds, and repaid earlier investors with the funds he received from later investors.  Kumbhani was already sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in late 2021 on similar charges, alongside BitConnect promoter Glenn Arcaro. Arcaro pleaded guilty to a similar BitConnect-related charge filed by the DOJ last September.  U.S. Assistant Attorney General Kenneth Polite Jr. said cryptocurrencies are continuing to be used in international crimes in a statement.  “The department is committed to protecting victims, preserving market integrity, and strengthening its global partnerships to hold accountable criminals engaging in cryptocurrency fraud. We thank our partners around the world for their continued efforts,"" he said.  In a statement, Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Special Agent in Charge Ryan Korner said malicious actors were increasingly using crypto.  “As cryptocurrency gains popularity and attracts investors worldwide, alleged fraudsters like Kumbhani are utilizing increasingly complex schemes to defraud investors, oftentimes stealing millions of dollars,” he said. “However, make no mistake, our agency will continue our long tradition of following the money, whether physical or digital, to expose criminal schemes and hold the fraudsters accountable for their illegal acts of trickery and deceit.”  BitConnect collapsed in dramatic fashion in 2018, shuttering its exchange and lending platforms within a week after receiving cease-and-desist orders from U.S. state regulators. The company attempted to continue raising proceeds through an initial coin offering (ICO).

42375236,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw6ek1,1645829750,"Former CFTC Chair Giancarlo on Russian Sanctions, CBDCs and Dollar Hegemony","Former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo, is worried central bank digital currencies (CBDC) in the hands of adversaries can bust U.S. sanctions. That’s why the U.S. should accelerate creating its own “digital dollar,” he said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” program on Friday.  Giancarlo, a co-founder of the Digital Dollar Foundation and senior counsel at Willkie Farr & Gallagher’s Digital Works unit, advocates for a CBDC to further U.S. interests and hegemony.  “CBDCs are absolutely being seen as a form of statecraft by countries that have been subjected to Western sanctions in the past and wish to have a way to avoid that in the future,” he said.  His comments come amid a period of increasing geopolitical tension – including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent financial sanctions imposed on the country by the West – and the rise of apolitical financial networks.  Nascent tools such as CBDCs and cryptocurrencies can theoretically bypass the dollar-denominated global economy, thereby thwarting U.S. influence abroad. China is far along on a pilot for its digital yuan, while Russia’s central bank only recently announced it has begun studying a CBDC to create a digital ruble.  Read more: China's Supreme Court Rules Crypto Transactions Constitute 'Illegal Fundraising'  Both nations have severely clamped down on domestic crypto use.  Giancarlo, nicknamed “Crypto Dad” by many, began his CBDC advocacy in 2020 through the Digital Dollar Project, which launched a pilot program for the greenback last year. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed, he argued that if the U.S. could send a man to the moon, the country could send the dollar into cyberspace.  Developing a CBDC in the U.S., however, will likely take years. A long-awaited Federal Reserve white paper on the subject, published in January, was seen as a “first step” towards an official digital dollar, but did not commit to a timetable.  Although Giancarlo claims a U.S. CBDC would, as he previously wrote, “extend the central role of the U.S. dollar in global finance and allow it to compete confidently in the new digital era,” he is not “for or against” sanctioning Russia. “I'll leave the geopolitical response to the people that are in charge of it,” he said.  He is concerned, however, that the extensive use of sanctions could be “the last hoorah” for that political weapon, and drive foreign states and companies to circumvent U.S. law.  Read more: President Biden Announces Technology Export Controls, Bank Sanctions Against Russia  “I think [sanctions] could drive and accelerate work by China and Russia to develop CBDCs and move portions of the globe off the dollar based system that we have today,” he said.  That could be concerning, he said. If the U.S. fails to accelerate developing a CBDC, its rivals, particularly China, could end up dominating the underlying technology used by others.  “In the same way they've done with 5G technology, they can be a major exporter of CBDC infrastructure,” Giancarlo said. “It's going to be CBDC-in-a-box provided to you by the People's Bank of China.”",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | COMMODITY | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/25/former-cftc-chair-giancarlo-on-russian-sanctions-cbdcs-and-dollar-hegemony,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e3e18d4b72b290ced4d6e680fd029e847837710b-720x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410915,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtGUy,1645825040,JoinMarket Is About to Make Bitcoin Privacy More User-Friendly,"A new web user interface (UI) is under way for JoinMarket, an open-source Bitcoin privacy project that has been around since 2015.  Using Bitcoin normally isn't very private, unless you really know what you're doing. Once the JoinMarket UI is finished, developers hope it will give users an easier way to privatize their bitcoin.  The latest release of Bitcoin privacy software JoinMarket, released on Friday, was an important first step on the path toward a user-friendly privacy solution. Though it's notable that a user-friendly UI is in progress, the UI is not safe to use yet, and still needs developers to test it and work on it behind the scenes. ""We consider it alpha software, so keep your expectations low,"" said Gigi, a developer who contributes to the JoinMarket UI and the author of the popular book about Bitcoin ""21 Lessons.""  Many developers see privacy as an important component of Bitcoin that needs improving.  Read more: Bitcoin Isn’t Private – But Its Recent Taproot Upgrade Will Help  ""When the internet came around, privacy was an afterthought. Slowly and painfully, we, as a society, figured out that having all communications in plain text is a terrible idea. Freedom and human rights quickly fall to the wayside if everyone is surveilled at all times. The switch from HTTP to HTTPS took a long time. I hope that, in Bitcoin, a similar switch won't take as long,"" Gigi said.  Current limitations of CoinJoins  Since the Bitcoin blockchain is public for all to view, it's easy to see where bitcoins have come from if people don't take extra precautions. CoinJoins provide a way to mix bitcoins together with other people's bitcoins to make it harder to detect where the bitcoins originally came from.  Recent events, however, have called the effectiveness of CoinJoins into question. This week journalist Laura Shin claimed to have tracked down the famous DAO hacker with the help of the blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, which says it was able to track the hacker's funds, even though they were CoinJoined. However, Chainalysis would not specify whether this means they can break and track funds of any CoinJoin, or if they were able to track the hacker due to other messy privacy practices.  Read more: Bitcoin Mixers: How Do They Work and Why Are They Used?  From a technical perspective, there is still much work to be done to ensure that CoinJoins can fulfill their promise to provide the level of security and privacy that bitcoiners are looking for. One area of concern has been making the process less complex and more accessible to the average user.  JoinMarket offers a unique way to make CoinJoins. This new web UI will make it easier for users to take advantage of JoinMarket, if they so choose.  So far, JoinMarket hasn't been particularly easy to use. The JoinMarket UI for node solution RaspiBlitz, for instance, requires some command-line know-how – which generally only developers know how to navigate. While there have been a couple of UIs along the way, this in-progress UI ""will massively increase ease of use,"" JoinMarket's official Twitter account said.  ""To have strong privacy guarantees in the open and transparent world of Bitcoin, special kinds of transactions have to be created. JoinMarket helps you to create these transactions in an easy and automated way,"" the app explains during its new user set up process  A decentralized, peer-to-peer CoinJoin market  The wallet apps Wasabi and Samourai provide other options for shielding a user's tracks with CoinJoins.  JoinMarket is more decentralized than other alternatives because it's peer-to-peer: It doesn't have a third-party known as a ""coordinator"" responsible for creating the CoinJoins. In Bitcoin techie lingo, JoinMarket has no ""single point of failure."" Rather, the JoinMarket software directly connects users who want to CoinJoin. It consists of ""makers,"" the pool liquidity providers, who might take a fee for allowing others to use their bitcoins to scramble with other bitcoins, and ""takers,"" who pay the fee in order to CoinJoin their bitcoin.  ""Since JoinMarket is a peer-to-peer system, trusted third parties are eliminated from the get-go. This unique market-driven approach reduces counterparty risk to a minimum,"" the website explains.  Gigi is one developer working on the JoinMarket UI. ""I like other projects as well, but JoinMarket doesn't get the love it deserves,"" he said.

42422880,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qZHh,1645824167,Market Wrap: Cryptos and Stocks Rise on Possibility of Russia-Ukraine Talks,"Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies rose on Friday after Russia agreed to negotiatehttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/russia-says-it-agrees-to-talks-with-ukraine-271645796235 with Ukrainian officials.  ""Vladimir Putin is ready to send to Minsk a Russian delegation,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Friday. Still, the situation was unstable, especially after Russian forces intensified attacks on Ukraine’s capital in recent days. The Russian president later made comments suggesting that he was not serious about participating in talks.  Meanwhile, global markets were in a state of flux as investors tried to make sense of geopolitical moves. The S&P 500 stock index rose over 2%, while Russia's ruble ticked higher, albeit near its weakest level on record.  In crypto markets, bitcoin underperformed most alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) on Friday, suggesting a greater appetite for risk among investors. BTC was roughly flat over the past 24 hours, compared with a 5% gain in XRP and a 10% rise in Terra's LUNA token over the same period.  Some investors expect the rebound in crypto prices to continue because of the spike in volatility. Bitcoin's one-week implied volatility jumped to an annualized 75% on Thursday, topping the one-, three- and six-month gauges, similar to what occurred after the May 2021 crash. Further, bitcoin's inverted volatility structure typically precedes price bottoms, according to CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole. Implied volatility refers to investors' expectations for price turbulence over a specific period.  Volatility spikes can be short-lived, however, which could delay a significant upswing in BTC's spot price.  ""These spikes in spot price would probably be met with aggressive spot selling, capping the topside,"" QCP Capital, a Singapore-based crypto trading firm, wrote in a Telegram announcement this week.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $3,9093, +2.28%    ●Ether (ETH): $2,710, +2.66%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4,385, +2.24%    ●Gold: $1,892 per troy ounce, −1.73%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 1.99%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Volume spike  Similar to volatility, bitcoin's trading volume across major exchanges reached the highest level since the Dec. 5 price crash, according to CoinDesk data. Typically, high-volume sell-offs indicate capitulation, which could lead to short-term price jumps.  Over the past 24 hours, the ratio of buy volume relative to sell volume was slightly higher, indicating bullish sentiment among traders, according to data compiled by CryptoQuant.  Still, trading volume has trended lower over the past few months.  ""Consumer volumes on the exchange remain tepid despite large moves in the crypto space, suggesting reduced risk appetite and light overall positioning in markets,"" David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase, wrote in a Friday email to clients.  Coinbase reported its fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday, which beat revenue estimates. However, the exchange warned shareholders about high volatility, and stated that trading volumes could decline during the first quarter of this year.  Altcoin roundup  Terra's LUNA surges: LUNA, a token of the decentralized payments platform, rose as much as 27% in 24 hours to regain $25 billion market capitalization in early European hours on Friday. The price spike was among the biggest for LUNA after months of downward movements. Still, the price is down 30% from December's all-time high of $103. Earlier this week, Singapore-based non-profit organization Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) said it would create a bitcoin-denominated reserve as an additional layer of security for UST, Terra's decentralized stablecoin.

42421838,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwSIH,1645820354,What Is a Block Reward?,"A block reward is a portion of newly minted digital tokens assigned to a user who helps to verify transactions on a blockchain protocol. The users who verify transactions are collectively known as validators, but can also be called stakers or miners – depending on the consensus mechanism used by the blockchain (proof-of-stake or proof-of-work, respectively.)  What are block rewards used for?  Protocols need to provide incentives for distributed volunteer users to discover new blocks in order to secure the network and ensure it continues to operate. Because no central administrator watches over bitcoin (BTC) and all other cryptocurrencies, block rewards serve as the primary financial incentive for people to participate in the network.  As mentioned, block rewards also serve as the exclusive issuance system for releasing newly minted coins into circulation. These are given to each successful validator that discovers (miner) or proposes (staker) new blocks. Sometimes, these rewards are fixed, meaning the same number of tokens are given as block rewards every time, while others gradually decrease the number of coins given as block rewards over time.  Bitcoin goes through a ‘‘halving‘’ roughly every four years, or 210,000 blocks. This means the block reward given to miners systematically halves over its lifespan. Since the last halving in May 2020, successful miners have been receiving 6.25 BTC for each block discovered, which usually takes approximately 10 minutes.  These figures and block reward schedules vary greatly among different projects.  Bitcoin’s block rewards have halved three times since the protocol launched in 2009 and will continue to halve until the total number of coins in circulation reaches the maximum supply of 21 million coins. After that, no more block rewards and no more new coins will enter circulation.  Read More: What Happens When All Bitcoin Are Mined?  Block rewards and transaction fees  It’s also important to note the difference between block rewards and transaction fees. For example, a bitcoin miner will receive both block rewards and any fees attached to the transactions they include in the new block. These are entirely separate, and once all bitcoin are mined it’s anticipated that miners will become solely reliant on transaction fees to maintain their operations.  Finally, block rewards are not always denominated in the same tokens being transacted on its blockchain. Stablecoins are a common example of this. In order to maintain a steady exchange rate against fiat currency, these protocols carefully control token supply. Therefore, they often reward their miners with a different native token. The Terra network, for example, rewards miners with its freely floating LUNA token, not with TerraUSD.

The project achieves this goal by providing historical and real cultural significance in the artworks which contain over 300+ high-quality traits. These traits make every Meta Pharaoh on the blockchain unique. To mint a Meta Pharaoh, you&apos;ll need to have ETH. If you don&apos;t, you can purchase ETH from any crypto exchange. Once that is done, download a MetaMask wallet and then transfer your ETH + gas fees to your wallet and you&apos;ll be ready to mint. One benefit of minting Meta Pharaohs is the offer of full commercial rights to the owner. What this means is that as an owner of a Meta Pharaohs NFT, you can build a brand around your character and take part in every major collaboration that happens after the project has been released. Meta Pharaohs utility Owning one Meta Pharaoh will give you access to the project&apos;s holder-only Discord server, but holding two or more of the tokens will make you a shareholder in the DAO Wallet. Apart from these, 500 of the most engaging members in the Meta Pharaohs community will receive an Infinite Objects Acrylic Display with their assigned NFT.

Sometimes you take that leap of faith and it just doesn't land quite right- that's ok! Eternally grateful for the amazing people I've met & proud of the work I've done,” Wu said on Twitter.  Wu said she will continue to invest and support “the best founders in the crypto ecosystem” but that she was “also excited to spend time exploring some side projects.”  Wu joined Coinbase in September 2021. Her work history includes roles at pre-seed fund Notation Capital and crypto research and data platform Messari.  Coinbase Ventures had a record investment year in 2021, having invested in just under 150 deals. The firm said those deals represented more than 90% of the funds the firm has deployed, on a cumulative basis, since its inception in 2018.  Archetype was founded by Ash Egan, who previously co-founded ConsenSys Ventures.

42394285,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbD97,1645818465,Apolitical Crypto Networks in Times of Sanction and War,"In response to Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine this week, transnational Western authorities have taken significant actions to restrict the Eurasian kleptocracy’s access to the global financial system. It remains to be seen whether Russia might face the ultimate sanction – wholesale removal from the international SWIFT system, which coordinates transfers between banks.  Such a cutoff from the Belgium-based Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications would be a world-historical turning point, arguably representing the end of the post-Cold War dream of a global democratic-neoliberal consensus. (Turns out “The End of History” was greatly exaggerated – there is a potential future beyond liberal capitalism.) It could also push at least some new amount of Russian and Russian-aligned financial activity onto decentralized networks such as Bitcoin, especially given the country’s deep involvement with the technology over the past decade.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Restrictions and sanctions on Russian institutions and individuals have come at a blistering pace this week. On Feb. 24, the U.S. Treasury Department announced it was cutting off Russia’s two largest banks, Sberbank and VTB Bank, from global U.S. dollar (USD) transactions, as well as seizing international accounts from Russian institutions and wealthy individuals. The European Union (EU) said Thursday it would seize personal assets of President Vladimir Putin and his deputy, Sergei Lavrov. China, another authoritarian state, has notably refused to impose sanctions on its neighbor.  Non-financial sanctions are also coming fast and furious. The U.S. has restricted technology exports along with imposing financial constraints. Taiwan, arguably the world’s most important maker of semiconductors, suggested Friday morning it will restrict supplies to Russia, with potentially devastating medium- and long-term consequences. In Norway, the seizure of a “yacht” owned by a Putin ally may have uncovered a sabotage operation targeting the Nordic region.  A remaining major question is SWIFT, the communications network that coordinates global interbank transfers. European international relations scholar Dóra Piroska is among those calling for removing Russian institutions from the platform. According to the New York Times, U.S. President Joe Biden has the unilateral power to kick Russia off SWIFT. Iranian institutions have previously been removed from SWIFT – in retaliation, it must be said, for actions far short of Russia’s invasion.  See also: Ukraine's Wealthy Finding It Hard to Buy Crypto  However, some argue that such a measure is unlikely. Since its founding in 1978, SWIFT has attempted to position itself as a neutral, nonpolitical entity, but the real obstacles are more complex. For instance, according to Bloomberg’s Javier Blas, Europe continued to buy Russian natural gas even as the invasion got into full swing. European nations including Germany are dependent on that fuel for winter heating and other energy needs. Cutting off SWIFT access would likely disrupt this vital trade, leverage Russia certainly weighed in its decision to invade Ukraine.  There is also a humanitarian argument for letting Russia keep access to SWIFT – a cutoff could harm many relative innocents. Cutting off Russian banks from SWIFT would shrink the economy, according to one estimate, by a stunning 5%, likely leading to the immiseration of many Russians.  Russia is an undemocratic authoritarian state whose leader has enriched himself and a circle of cronies through various forms of embezzlement. Putin, a former KGB agent who has ruled for close to two decades, is believed to be, in effect, the richest man in the world, but experts say much of his wealth has been placed in the custody of various so-called oligarchs. Much of this, it must be emphasized, was enabled by America and the West’s support for the rushed, ill-conceived and possibly corrupt privatization of the Russian economy following the collapse of the Soviet Union (USSR) in the 1990s.  Meanwhile, Russia has reportedly been developing its own alternative to SWIFT, which the former prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, claims is functional and could replace SWIFT access if necessary. That presents the possibility of Russia becoming the nexus for a second global banking network, one totally outside of European and U.S. influence, and likely not based on the U.S. dollar. Jared Bibler, a former Icelandic banking regulator, argued on Twitter on Thursday that American desire to maintain dollar dominance over the long term makes it unlikely Russia will be kicked off SWIFT.  If it were cut off, Russia could also transfer some international financial activity to crypto networks. According to the World Bank, Russia’s import/export flows total around $675 billion annually, a volume that could be accommodated with relative ease on the Bitcoin network. According to CoinDesk data, Bitcoin processes $20 billion in on-chain transactions per day, or more than $7 trillion per year. (Total cross-border capital flows from Russia, including finance in addition to trade, are considerably larger.)  Russia’s aggression is unfolding in a much more tightly connected world than the one of even three decades ago. It remains to be seen how Russia, once famous as a builder of defensive concrete walls, can deal with being hemmed in by less tangible financial barriers.

Major platforms began integrating with digital assets in the form of NFTs and crypto payments. Twitter, formerly led by Bitcoin bull Jack Dorsey, appears ahead of a race that for many started years ago. Big tech is just catching up. Twitter recently allowed its users to use their NFTs as profile pic with a new feature part of their Twitter Blue initiative. Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, and other social media platforms could soon follow in the footsteps of Twitter and integrate NFTs into their platforms. The sector has seen unprecedented growth with 2022 aligned to be yet another year of adoption of high demand for these digital assets. A report from Reuters records that NFT sales scored an impressive total of $25 billion last year alone which represents a 26,000% increase compared to 2020. The sector has been attracting attention from retail and institutional investors due to its potential to completely transform multiple industries, such as entertainment, sports, gaming, clothing and fashion, and others. NFTs could disrupt industries with billions of dollars in value. In 2022, the sector is expected to reach $80 billion in total sales driven by the growing interest, demand, and inherent scarcity. Its implementation on social media platforms with billions of monthly active users will only contribute to these digital assets&apos; upward trajectory.

13400682,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=228300,1645812012,ALPHA Technical Analysis: What Are The Chances Of Growth To $0.7,"During the last three trading weeks in the ALPHA market, sellers were able to lower the price to the main critical zone of $0.3. The last time the ALPHA price was in this range was in June 2021. At this time, the correction in the ALPHA market was much more aggressive in the dynamics of the fall. In addition, starting in May 2021, trading volumes during the fall wave were high enough to scare ALPHA investors. If you compare the current wave of falls from September 2021, you can see a radically different tactic. For the first time, trading volumes throughout the fall wave are lower than ever. The ALPHA price has been falling for almost six months. In the last 3 weeks alone, the trading volumes have doubled, which signals the interest of buyers in the range of $0.3. https://www.tradingview.com/x/YDpYuRlJ/ In the weekly timeframe we see a clear narrow channel of the ALPHA price fall. Sellers managed to update the local low from June 2021, but this did not add to the price of the fall dynamics. Therefore, in the case of keeping Bitcoin in the range of $34,000-$36,000, we expect the beginning of a sharp fall wave with the main target of $0.7. Though, this growth impulse should not be considered a global medium-term wave of growth. If the ALPHA price stops at $0.7, there is a high probability of a new growth wave with the final target of $0.2.

42394275,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbCOx,1645807247,The Unlikely Fix to Crypto's Privacy Failures: Government,"These last few weeks have underscored how difficult it is to achieve absolute privacy in our digital lives, including in crypto.  Maybe it’s time to acknowledge we can’t just rely on technology to protect this important right. It's time to also take on the difficult task of convincing governments to install legal protections.  Consider these recent news items: the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) founders doxed; a New York couple arrested for conspiracy to launder the Bitfinex hack’s proceeds; the co-founder of the notorious failed exchange QuadrigaX discovered to be the pseudonymous co-founder of Avalanche money market Wonderland; the seizure of crypto funds donated to Canada’s protesting truckers; and the apparent unveiling of the mastermind behind the 2016 attack on The DAO.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  All these incidents demonstrate that it’s extremely difficult, if not impossible, to escape someone who’s determined to track you down. Know-your-customer (KYC) rules, multiple passwords and data-tracking systems, with countless stores of information about our on- and offline lives held on corporate-owned servers around the world, all militate against our online privacy.  (I will say this, though: Satoshi Nakamoto was a master at OpSec.)  In each case, with varying degrees of popular support, the people who revealed these identities justified their actions in the public interest. On the other side: crypto advocates who were often incensed by these invasions of privacy, especially in the BAYC and trucker cases.  Read more: CoinDesk's Privacy Week  I don’t wish to reexamine the trade-off between the right to privacy and the public’s interest in transparency that I explored two weeks ago. However, I will say the industry’s condemnation of such actions can also be seen as a mark of its failure. I mean, if coin mixers, pseudonymous identifiers and self-custody wallets achieved what they’re supposed to achieve, crypto supporters would have nothing to complain about.  After reading journalist Laura Shin’s bombshell about The DAO hacker, for which she worked with blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis to trace the movement of the 3.6 million ether drained in the 2016 attack and named Austrian programmer Toby Hoenisch as the likely culprit, I’m inclined to concur with blockchain developer Nelson Galeman. He tweeted: “The lesson here is: DO NOT STEAL CRYPTO... data is public. Question is not IF you will get caught, but WHEN.” (Hoenisch has denied the accusation, but still.)  Bad guys aren’t the only ones caught out  This idea there’s nowhere to hide would perhaps be entirely positive if the only people seeking privacy in their crypto transactions were thieves. In fact, you could say the threat of being traced adds a whole new security layer to the crypto ecosystem. It’s a disincentive to hackers.  It could offer a model of freedom that’s commensurate with its Constitution and more appealing than China’s panopticon  But thieves aren’t alone. Activists fighting for good causes such as Afghan women in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, or Myanmar’s government in exile, or protesters in Nigeria, increasingly use crypto to bypass official censors and fund their operations. At the other end of the spectrum, businesses need privacy lest their competitors get wind of their operations and front-run them. Keeping money flows obscured is vital for the functioning of both democracy and markets.  “There are no other constitutional rights in substance without freedom to transact,” declared the pseudonymous commentator Punk 6529 – who will speak at Consensus in June – in a recent tweet thread.”  He’s right: There’s no freedom of speech if people can’t pay for the computing equipment needed to get their subversive ideas out or if they have no paycheck to sustain themselves. And, in turn, that freedom to transact depends on there being no capacity to monitor fund movements by third parties such as governments. Privacy and freedom to transact are intrinsic to each other.  The freedoms to which 6529 refers are truly at risk. Governments and Big Tech are more empowered than ever to track transactions.  That’s the case in traditional finance as well as in crypto, where institutions are now adding increasingly sophisticated blockchain forensics to their existing monitoring capabilities for traditional banking’s know-your-customer data and to access personal information accumulated by internet platforms.  Maybe a purely crypto circular economy, where funds never come in or out of the fiat banking system, would leave our identities better protected.  But crypto is populated by subpoenable entities, such as centralized exchanges, hosted wallets and stablecoin reserve managers. Even decentralized exchanges are open to scrutiny through the foundations that manage their codebases.  The sheer number of breaches and rug pulls in decentralized finance since that infamous DAO hack continue to make DeFi a fringe area where privacy advantages are, for the average person, outweighed by volatility, complexity of use and security risks.  Indeed, the biggest problem with all these breaches is not the cryptography per se – we know that zero-knowledge proof inventions such as zk-Snarks do actually protect privacy. It’s the weak points of human failure that make the crypto community’s privacy utopia so hard to achieve. That’s what we need to address.  Time to engage  Because of those ever-present weak human links, I now think we have no choice but to engage with governments. The crypto community, along with human rights organizations and others with an interest in financial inclusion, as well as media businesses and others invested in non-fungible tokens (NFT) and DeFi projects, should be lobbying policymakers to ensure that the coming wave of digital currency rollouts is accompanied by a legal framework that enshrines privacy protections into our money,  I get why that might sound naive. This week’s news out of Ukraine reminds us that nation-states are wont to exert power and loath to give it up. If anything, governments have been expanding their financial surveillance, not shrinking it. And the push for a strict sanctions regime against Russia is going to bolster the hawks’ clamor for even more intervention.  Yet, that reminder also provides a gut check on some of the more utopian “sovereign individual” aspirations in crypto.  Read more: Haseeb Qureshi - 4 Reasons Privacy Coins Haven't Taken Off  The key, I think, is to use the core problems of instability in the international system to our advantage. I believe this moment actually provides an opportunity for Western governments such as the U.S. to use new technologies to advance the influence of liberal democratic ideals. The challenge is they’ll have to wean themselves off the intoxicating but mostly illusory sense of power that comes from financial surveillance.  Given the current geopolitical turmoil and some nascent questions around the longevity of the dollar’s international reserve currency status, the U.S. could for the first time in a century be forced to compete with other countries’ currencies, such as China’s.  Once national currencies go digital and can bypass Wall Street’s banking gatekeepers, the battle will be on. And one way for the U.S. to win it will be to adopt a more pro-privacy approach. It could offer a model of freedom that’s commensurate with its Constitution and more appealing than China’s “panopticon.”  If this system is designed right, it need not result in more criminals trafficking drugs, arms or human beings. In the name of freedom and equal access, authorities could deregulate peer-to-peer cryptocurrency payments and roll back KYC identification. At the same time, they could use zero-knowledge proofs to limit traceable data to non-identifying information while still employing blockchain forensics and cluster analysis to get leads on suspicious activity.  In other words, there is a way to catch bad guys without subjecting the world to surveillance or denying the freedom to transact.  What we need is a risk-based approach. If we give people control over their assets, there will be less of an incentive for criminals to spend the time and effort to go after those relatively small nodes or, by the same token, for governments to surveil them. Value extracted both from criminal activity and from deploying surveillance only really accrues when the amounts involved are high. The trick is to change the economics of crime.  Now, off you go.

42394276,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbCZD,1645804921,5 Essential Questions About Crypto Taxes,"The real winners of the Super Bowl this year weren’t the Rams, who played a great game to win the title. They were cryptocurrencies, which in a few years have gone from nerd obsession to powerhouse advertiser buying airtime on the most watched television event of the year.  But crypto going mainstream has left an increasing number of investors puzzled about their tax obligations. As this year's April 18 tax deadline approaches, they will need answers more urgently.  Ben Borodach is co-founder of April, a tax platform that enables American taxpayers to file their returns more easily and affordably.  Let’s start with the good news. Tax treatments have evolved from a one-size-fits-all approach to more nuanced guidelines for disposals, staking, hard-forks, payments and gifts, among other events relevant to crypto.  While this shift has been helpful, fundamental issues remain unsettled; crypto activities, including transfers to wallets and the exchange of one digital currency for another have required new thinking. Cost basis, fair market value and date of receival can be difficult, if not impossible, to document. Staking, which can involve thousands of continuous, crypto-based transactions at varying fair market values, presents its own challenges.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s Tax Week.  To be sure, some policy issues around unclaimed staking and wash sales are still evolving. But we need better direction that does not treat crypto like a traditional asset and accounts for its unique characteristics.  Meanwhile, here are five essential questions you’re likely to ask this tax season as you try to navigate the gray areas of crypto taxation. The information below is not personal tax advice. If you have questions specific to your circumstances, consult a tax adviser or the IRS website.  Do I have to pay taxes on my crypto even if I don't receive tax forms from my exchange?  Yes. According to the IRS, virtual currencies are treated as property. When you sell that property, you must report a gain or loss. If you sold the crypto on an exchange, over the counter (OTC) or traded it to a friend or family member, you must legally report this transaction. Both on-chain and off-chain transactions fall under this treatment, including crypto that is transferred through local wallets.  Read More: 4 Crypto Tax Myths You Need to Know  My exchange marked crypto I transferred to myself as taxable. What should I do?  Many crypto traders have multiple wallets and transfer crypto between accounts. Ultimately, transactions among wallets you own and control are not taxable. However, the existence of multiple wallets can create headaches in tax reporting because exchanges and wallets lack context and may treat a transaction as a taxable event. To avoid problems, keep diligent records as you go or white-label wallet addresses. Cointracker offers helpful tools for recording your crypto activities. Unfortunately, you will have to review transactions individually and mark them accordingly to ensure accuracy.  If I bought crypto with another crypto, is it a taxable event?  A common example is the purchase of a non-fungible token (NFT) where you needed an on-ramp to make the acquisition in ether. Such transactions can be tricky because you must report your taxes in U.S. dollars when both assets exchanged have a discrete unit of account. According to the IRS, you must determine fair market value in U.S. dollars when you made the transaction of both currencies and report the difference between your basis and the sale amount. If your exchange doesn't provide you with this documentation, or you made an OTC transaction, explorers and trackers such as CoinMarketCap or Messari can be good resources.  Is crypto that I received through staking or forking taxable?  Yes. The IRS guidelines are clear that if you receive crypto from a hard fork, you should treat it as ordinary income based on the fair market value of that crypto when it was received. As stated above, unclaimed rewards are a gray area where you may want to consult a tax pro. You should also treat claimed staked rewards as ordinary income. If you are staking outside an exchange that documents the fair market value at the time of custody, you may want to use third-party tooling to help your documentation.  Read More: The 7 Types of Crypto Tax Nightmares  Is crypto treated as capital gains or income tax?  It depends. According to the IRS, crypto that is disposed of is treated as a capital gain or loss, whereas crypto that is received through staking or forking is treated as ordinary income. There are some exceptions, including crypto that you receive as a bona fide gift and may be exempt.

42421840,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwSJJ,1645801379,What Is a Satoshi? Understanding the Smallest Unit of Bitcoin,"There are 100 million satoshis (sats) in one bitcoin, meaning each satoshi is worth 0.00000001 BTC. In order for one satoshi to be worth one cent, 1 BTC would need to be worth $1 million.  As of early 2022, a satoshi is worth less than a twentieth of a cent.  The satoshi is not the only subdivision of bitcoin. A millibitcoin is a term for one-thousandth of a bitcoin or 0.001 BTC. A microbitcoin is one-millionth of a bitcoin or 0.000001 BTC. On the Lightning network, it is possible to transact using a unit even smaller than the satoshi. Known as the millisatoshi, it represents one-thousandth of the size of a single satoshi, but this is not usable on the bitcoin network itself.  Using terms like satoshis, or other small units, means users avoid having to write out strings of zeros when very small volumes of the cryptocurrency are involved.  Dividing bitcoins into fractions is necessary to facilitate microtransactions, such as buying a coffee – though due to the asset’s high volatility it’s not regarded as a suitable medium of exchange. Satoshis have become indispensable since a single bitcoin rose to be worth tens of thousands of dollars. It also means prospective investors can purchase as little as $1 worth of BTC, rather than having to purchase a whole bitcoin.  As bitcoin’s block rewards halve roughly every four years, the new tokens being minted every 10 minutes will at some point be counted in satoshis rather than bitcoin. The minting of new bitcoin will eventually have to stop sometime in the next century because satoshis exist. It will not be possible to continue minting new bitcoin forever in smaller and smaller quantities.  The satoshi is named after bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. He, she or they have stopped acting under that name since 2010 and left few clues as to who they might be.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE,Benedict George,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-satoshi-understanding-the-smallest-unit-of-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/da310e972ee86c037bf3defcd9ca6c27284a0f91-1441x1081.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The parliament member in charge, who is known as the rapporteur, Stefan Berger, has asked for more time to clarify the provisions, according to a Twitter post he made on Friday. The parliament was supposed to vote on the draft for the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework on Feb. 28.  A draft of the framework, which included a provision that implied lawmakers were planning to restrict the use of cryptocurrencies that rely on an energy-intensive computing process called proof-of-work, began circulating earlier this week. According to the provisions, crypto firms will no longer be able to provide services that require the use of proof-of-work based cryptocurrencies starting in January 2025. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum currently rely on proof-of-work.  “The current discussion about MiCA indicates that individual passages of the draft report can be misinterpreted and seen as a ban on proof-of-work. It would be fatal if the European Parliament were to send the wrong signal by voting under these circumstances,” Berger wrote in an email to CoinDesk. The statement mirrored what he posted on Twitter.  Berger added that he sees an urgent need to resume talks with parliamentary groups on this topic and to present clear facts on proof-of-work.  ""As rapporteur, it is crucial for me that the MiCA report is not interpreted as a de facto ban on bitcoin,” Berger said.  He did not specify when the vote will take place next.

He maintained an overweight rating while reducing the price target to $296 from $345.  Coinbase shares (COIN) fell about 4.5% at Friday's market open after retreating following the earnings release late Thursday. The company provided a strong fourth-quarter report, though cited near-term crypto and macroeconomic headwinds.  The crypto exchange said crypto asset volatility and prices have dropped from the all-time highs set in the fourth quarter, owing in part to macroeconomic factors and geopolitical instability in parts of the world. As a result, it expects retail monthly transacting users and total trading volume to be lower in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter.  “Still, COIN remains an attractive story for those that want to buy it on spot price weakness as the company continues to expand, diversify and gain share against the backdrop of a potentially hyper growth TAM,” Canaccord’s Joseph Vafi said in a note, referring to total addressable market, or potential market size. The firm maintained a buy rating and reduced its price target to $275 from $342, citing potential for volatility in Coinbase’s margin profile.  Analysts expecting more detail on Coinbase’s non-fungible token (NFT) plans, though, will have to wait because the company didn’t provide a firm date around any product launches.  “We remain hopeful that the company is taking its time to ensure that it has a fully scalable NFT product at launch which could allow COIN to quickly take market share in a fast growing vertical,” Needham & Co.’s John Todaro said. He also maintained his buy rating, while cutting the price target to $360 from $420.  Coinbase said on its conference call they expect to be competitive in this segment and doesn’t view NFTs as a “zero-sum game.”  UPDATE (Feb 25, 15:07 UTC): Rewrites subhead to reflect share trading, updates share price in third paragraph.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Michael Bellusci,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/02/25/coinbase-remains-a-market-leader-despite-near-term-headwinds-analysts-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6d4af9e2555774c41dd0dcdcd3d74db00e5def30-1420x915.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Sign up here to get it in your inbox each weekday morning.  Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoin recovers as the West's sanctions on Russia were softer than feared.  Featured stories: Bitcoin's technical charts signal seller fatigue.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show ""First Mover,"" hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9 a.m. U.S. Eastern time. Today's show will feature guests:  Christopher Giancarlo, senior counsel at the Willkie Farr & Gallagher law firm in New York and a former chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission  Yaya J. Fanusie, chief strategist at Cryptocurrency AML Strategies  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Bitcoin held on to its recovery from one-month lows early today, while European and Asian stocks gained ground and the safe-haven dollar dropped as the West's sanctions on Russia were softer than feared.  Alternative cryptocurrencies led the broader crypto market recovery, having taken a bigger hit on Thursday. Layer 1 coins like LUNA, FTM and DOT were notable gainers along with GNT, the native coin of decentralized peer-to-peer network Golem, which boasted a 60% gain on a 24-hour basis.  The crypto market risk reset looked to continue, going by how options traders priced expectations for bitcoin's price turbulence over different time frames and positive news flow from the war front.  ""President Xi Jinping has just spoken with his Russian counterpart on the phone. President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is willing to have high-level dialogue with Ukraine,"" Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China's Foreign Ministry, tweeted.  During North American trading hours, the focus will be on Wall Street and the U.S. economic data, which could sway expectations of how aggressive the Federal Reserve would be in scaling back stimulus.  According to investing.com, data due at 13:30 UTC is expected to show that U.S. personal spending rose 1.6% from the prior month, beating December's print of -0.6%. Durable goods orders for January, also due at 13:30 UTC, are expected to rise by 0.8%, after falling 0.7% the previous month. Lastly, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, is forecast to rise to 5.1% on the year in January.  A big beat on expectations may cement the case for a 50 basis point interest rate hike next month, bringing renewed selling pressure to bitcoin and other risk assets. Several Fed officials have recently expressed support for a 50 basis point move in March. On Thursday, markets priced out prospects of such a move after Russia invaded Ukraine.

The candle engulfed the preceding day's losses.  Long-legged candles indicate that sellers initially controlled the market only to be overpowered by buyers ahead of the UTC close. Thus, long-legged candles imply bear fatigue, mainly when they occur at multi-month lows or after a prolonged sell-off, as is the case with bitcoin.  That said, a strong follow-through remains elusive. ""On bitcoin, yesterday saw a combined Key Reversal Up & Bullish Engulfing Pattern. However, there has been no follow-through higher today,"" Eddie Tofpik, head of technical analysis and senior markets analyst at London-based ADM Investor Services International, wrote in a LinkedIn chat.  Chart-based traders usually want to see a strong follow-through after long-legged candles before calling a bullish trend change. So, Friday's UTC close is pivotal.

42375255,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw6f49,1645788109,Bitcoin's Implied Volatility Suggests Recovery Set to Continue,"Bitcoin's swift recovery from one-month lows has some investors saying the rebound is likely to continue. The activity in the options market suggests they may be right.  Data provided by derivatives research firm Skew show bitcoin's one-week implied volatility jumped to an annualized 75% on Thursday, topping the one-, three- and six-month gauges, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine saw investors dump risky assets in favor of gold and fiat currency havens.  ""Bitcoin's short-term implied volatility exceeding long-term implied volatility indicates a likelihood of market reversal,"" Robbie Liu, a researcher at crypto financial services provider Babel Finance, told CoinDesk in an email. ""A similar trend was observed after the May 2021 crash.""  Implied volatility refers to investors' expectations for price turbulence over a specific period. While the metric is forward-looking, it doesn't say anything about the direction of the impending price volatility.  The metric is mainly determined by the demand for options, which are hedging tools. As such, a pop in implied volatility is taken to represent uncertainty and an inverted structure, in which short-term implied volatility is greater than the longer-term gauges, signals panic.  Historically, the inverted structure has marked a price bottom.  The one-week implied volatility last topped the longer-term gauges on Jan. 24 when bitcoin fell to a six-month low under $33,000. The cryptocurrency picked up a bid on the following day and hit highs above $45,000 early this month. Bitcoin's early December sell-off ran out of steam with the one-week gauge rising well above the six-month metric.  Bitcoin's late September 2021 bottom and May-June 2021 bottom coincided with short-term volatility expectations signaling panic.  If history is a guide, bitcoin may build on Thursday's rebound from lows under $34,500. That said, the cryptocurrency remains vulnerable to renewed risk aversion in stocks. ""This is only a short-term resurge and does not mean that BTC won't drop below $34,000 in the mid-term,"" Liu said.  At press time, bitcoin was trading near $38,600, representing a 0.6% gain on the day.

Flexpool is the world's fifth-biggest ether mining pool, according to information platform miningpoolstats.com. It is probably the first to cut access for Russians amid the security crisis.

42375252,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw6f0N,1645781912,Terra’s LUNA Surges 27% to Regain $25B Market Capitalization,"Terra’s LUNA tokens surged 27% in 24 hours to regain a $25 billion market capitalization in early European hours on Friday.  The move erased almost all losses from Thursday, when crypto and global markets slid following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  LUNA traded at $66 at the time of writing, up from $50 on Thursday night, with nearly $3.8 billion worth of the tokens traded on various crypto exchanges in the past 24 hours. The 25% spike in price was among the biggest for LUNA in recent times after months of downward movements. Still, the price is down 35% from December's lifetime high of $103.  Price chart analysis suggests LUNA could continue a run to $69 before encountering resistance. Readings on the relative strength index (RSI) gauge reached 72, suggesting a cooldown in prices as the asset enters “overbrought” levels.  RSI is a tool that calculates the magnitude of price movements to indicate a change in trend. Readings above 70 indicate an asset is ""overbrought"" and could decline, while values under 30 suggest an asset is “oversold” and could see upward movement.  LUNA was among the largest crypto market gainers in the past two years as demand for decentralized financial services, which rely on smart contracts instead of third parties, picked up among retail traders. Investors have captured some 54,400% in gains from lows of $0.121798 on Mar 18, 2020, to the current level, data from tracking tool CoinGecko shows.  Earlier this week, Singapore-based non-profit organization Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) said it would create a bitcoin-denominated reserve as an additional layer of security for UST – Terra's decentralized stablecoin, whose value is pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar.  LFG said Tuesday it had raised $1 billion through private token sales to build the reserve and the buyers will lock up the coins for four years. The funding round was led by influential crypto investors Jump Crypto, DeFiance Capital and Three Arrows Capital, causing a jump in LUNA prices at the time.  ""This is a significant step towards risk minimization and strengthening the confidence of $UST,"" Yeou Jie, portfolio growth lead at DeFiance, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. ""The demand of $UST is also increasing steadily and the market cap is climbing.""  Other major cryptocurrencies have gained almost 10% on average in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) regained the crucial $38,000 level and ether (ETH) rose to as much as $2,690 before a $40 slide in early European hours.

Bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and other major cryptocurrencies have added close to 10% in 24 hours, almost regaining Wednesday night’s levels. Bitcoin traded near $38,400 at the time of publication, up from Thursday’s low of $34,725.  The rebound, which started in U.S. morning hours on Thursday, caused over $184 million worth of losses due to liquidations on crypto-tracked futures in the past 12 hours. Some 73% of traders were short the market, or betting against a rise, data from analytics tool Coinglass showed.  Over $52 million of shorts were liquidated on crypto exchange OKX, the most among other crypto futures exchanges, with $23 million stemming from bitcoin-tracked futures alone. Binance followed next, with $25 million in losses from liquidated shorts, with FTX at $16 million.  Overall in the past 12 hours, $89 million of bitcoin-tracked futures were liquidated, $53 million in ether-tracked futures and $5.86 million in futures tracking Terra’s LUNA token.  The losses contributed to a 24-hour total liquidations figure of $405 million. Some 83,000 individual trading accounts suffered losses, with the largest liquidation order occurring on BitMEX for a bitcoin futures trade valued at over $7.95 million.  Rebounds in cryptocurrencies followed similar moves in global markets. The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index, which tracks companies in Asia, rose almost 1% on Friday after dropping 3.1% on Thursday. Benchmark equity indexes rose across Europe, with the Stoxx Europe 600 index adding more than 1%. In the U.S., the S&P 500 stock index closed 1.5% higher Thursday as the country tightened sanctions against Russia.  Some analysts say demand for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could mount in the coming days because they are seen as liquid instruments.  “Right now, the markets have the highest demand for liquid instruments, making bitcoin slightly less of a risk than altcoins,” Alex Kuptsikevich, a senior financial analyst at FxPro, said in an email to CoinDesk. “It is likely that a further deterioration in the financial situation could benefit the first cryptocurrency as a means of capital savings for investors from Ukraine, Russia and some nearby countries.""",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/25/short-positions-see-143m-in-liquidations-as-bitcoin-ether-gain-10,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a5a0720787d057f0afc32245c52f932f7aca6c5-4000x3000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
