42401518,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAczuUR,1525899611,"Zcash Privacy Weakened by Certain Behaviors, Researchers Say","Researchers have identified patterns in certain kinds of zcash transactions that weaken their anonymity, according to a paper published Tuesday.  George Kappos, Haaroon Yousaf, Mary Maller and Sarah Meiklejohn found that when coins move from ""unshielded"" to ""shielded"" and back to ""unshielded"" addresses, they lose much of the anonymity that zcash users expect. The University College London team wrote that their ""relatively simple heuristics … reduce the size of the overall anonymity set by 69.1 percent.""  Zcash, one of the most prominent and well-regarded privacy coins, offers two kinds of addresses: ""t-addresses"" are transparent or unshielded, meaning that their balances and transactions are publicly visible on the blockchain; ""z-addresses"" are shielded, meaning that their balances and transactions are invisible.  Transactions from one unshielded address to another are completely public, if pseudonymous, as in bitcoin. Transactions from one shielded address to another are almost completely invisible, showing only the timestamps and fees associated with mining.  Transactions between different types of addresses introduce complications, however, making it possible to glean some information about the z-addresses involved, according to the paper.  Part of the reason is behavioral, the authors explain. ""Our heuristics would have been significantly less effective if the founders interacting with the pool behaved in a less regular fashion,"" they write. ""In particular, by always withdrawing the same amount in the same time intervals, it became possible to distinguish founders withdrawing funds from other users.""  The reason for these transactions – and similar ones performed by miners – is that zcash coins are required to pass through the ""shielded pool"" of z-addresses before they can be used for another transaction.  The researchers wrote that they alerted the founders to this problem before publishing their research, which they add has already led to a change in behavior.  In a response, Zcash founder Zooko Wilcox and marketing director Josh Swihart congratulated the research team, saying they ""invite other scientists to join with us in investigating these questions that are important to the future of human society.""  Regarding the actual privacy concern, the post said:  ""It is valuable to understand how much privacy is lost when using shielded addresses as a pass-through mechanism, but using it in that way is not recommended. Instead, store your Zcash in a shielded address.""  Further, Wilcox and Swihart said that planned upgrades to the zcash protocol - specifically the Sapling hard fork - would lessen the risks to anonymity identified in the paper.  Currently, only a minority of transactions are shielded, and far fewer are fully shielded, with z-addresses on both sides. According to the Zchain block explorer, 85 percent of transactions over the past month are fully public, and just 0.6 percent are fully shielded.

42401521,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAczuXO,1525894511,Messaging Giant WeChat Suspends Third-Party Blockchain App,"China's most popular messaging application, WeChat, has frozen a third-party blockchain application designed to introduce the nascent technology to a wide user base.  The mini-program, called Xiao Xieyi (or Mini Protocol in a literal translation), was launched on Wednesday and touted as a service that would allow users on WeChat to initiate contractual agreements, according to the Chinese business news outlet Caijinghttp://tech.caijing.com.cn/20180509/4450162.shtml. However, the app, which is owned by Tencent, suspended the program within a day.  Upon reaching consensus, the tool - developed by a Beijing-based blockchain-as-a-service platform called Niuco Box - would encrypt and record agreements on a blockchain for a fee. The funds raised through the app would pay miners who write transactions onto the network underpinning the application.  The effort may mark one of the first moves by Chinese blockchain developers to make the technology accessible to mainstream social media users. In March 2018, Tencent CEO Pony Ma claimed the messaging app now has more than 1 billion monthly active users across the world.  Yet, the program has already been suspended by WeChat. A search of its name now leads to a page which explains the program has violated rules on the platform, though the exact violation remains unknown.  ""The Mini Protocol is now being suspended because the type of its service is not yet authorized by the platform,"" the app said.  WeChat could not be reached for comment as of press time.

42401506,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAczuGf,1525890416,"This Blockchain Tosses Blocks: Naval, MetaStable Back Twist on Crypto 'Cash'","A blockchain without the blocks?  Not exactly, but a company launching Wednesday called O(1) is seeking to take the unorthodox approach of throwing out the blocks its new Coda protocol produces as soon as they elapse. While that might seem illogical since blockchain's immutable history is to many its principal benefit, an impressive line-up of investors believes the idea could be just what cryptocurrency needs.  Led by Metastable, AngelList co-founder Naval Ravikant, and Twitter and Google alum Elad Gil, O(1) has secured a $3.5 million seed equity round, with investment from Coinbase alums Fred Ehrsam and Linda Xie and Polychain Capital joining to complete the fundraise.  ""What attracted me was a small, scalable blockchain that’s still independently verifiable on small nodes,"" Ravikant told CoinDesk.  And that's no small feat given the growing costs of storing major blockchains, which are designed largely to keep a record of every transaction ever made over the network. Still, that transaction history is also a strength since that's what allows miners and users to check the accuracy of transactions.  But if there's no requirement to hold the ledger, why would anyone trust the Coda Protocol to be accurate?  Because it uses something called ""snarks"" in a clever way. If you've been around crypto, you've likely heard the term zk-snarks, most widely known as a privacy technology advanced by zcash, but which has recently gained momentum with other blockchain projects including ethereum and even JPMorgan's private blockchain Quorom.  Yet, O(1) isn't so much concerned about the privacy aspects of the technology (it's not a privacy coin, because a validator could hold onto the ledger if they really wanted to) but believes it can be adapted to build a blockchain that doesn't have the scalability hurdles of blockchain's today.  ""It's a cryptocurrency that's decentralized at scale,"" O(1)'s co-founder and CTO Izaak Meckler explained.  He told CoinDesk:  ""I think what we're building is really decentralized peer-to-peer cash. So, basically people who are enthusiastic about that idea would be enthusiastic about our protocol.""  O(1)'s protocol will support a native cryptocurrency called Coda coins using an uncapped networked of proof-of-stake validators, but distribution plans and the size of the cryptocurrency pool have yet to be determined.  All O(1) would commit to was launching the testnet in the third quarter of this year.  Snarks for scale  There should be lots of people excited about the concept, but probably many wondering how exactly it works.  Simply, a snarks cryptographic proof – one that can demonstrate that every wallet on the blockchain has the crypto that it should – stands in for the full ledger. The ledger then does not need to be stored forever; the proof stands in for the transaction history and explains the blockchain's state.  Each new block will generate a new proof, which reflects the validity of past proofs that will be transmitted to every wallet. Because the proof will be only a few hundred bytes, vastly smaller than the gigabytes a bitcoin node needs to download to participate in that protocol's verification, O(1) contends even smartphones will be able to run verification on the snarks proof.  ""There's this tension between scaling and decentralization because the burden of decentralization increases as the network grows,"" Meckler said.  But the Coda Protocol has been designed so that every new proof stays the same size.  ""In our, case it's really succinctness that's important. These things are a few hundred bytes, like a few tweets, and they can be checked quickly,"" Meckler said. ""So the chain itself never grows.""  According to Meckler:  ""It's like a picture of a picture of a picture.""  Making it understandable  This is what makes the Coda Protocol so technically compelling but also psychologically daunting.  Knowing that the bitcoin blockchain has a line item for every transaction ever made is something many can grasp intuitively. O(1)'s use of snarks proofs blurs that process a bit and could be challenging for many to really wrap their head around, or more importantly trust.  Meckler acknowledges this, saying, ""Something is not truly a proof unless it's legible to you. A core design constraint for us is: Let's make this something that's something easy to read.""  To that end, O(1) wrote a programming language called Snarky for writing verifiable computations.  And while that may still be over the average user's head, the O(1) detailed a hypothetical applicationhttps://o1labs.org/blog/posts/snarky.html on their blog.  The example outlines how votes would be hashed and counted when a group was trying to decide what pizza toppings to order. While silly, the example displays how each vote is hashed separately and then hashed together so that all users can tell their vote was counted, but can't view any other user's vote.  Speaking to the trustworthiness of snarks, Ravikant said, ""So far so good although the only real solution here is more time and more scrutiny.""  Yet, the O(1) team itself seems is optimistic its design will drastically change the blockchain space, saying in a statement:  ""By compressing the blockchain down to the size of a couple tweets, Coda makes entirely new things possible.""

Appearing as a guest at the Late Show with Stephen Colbert on Tuesday, Ohanian touted the idea of a digital currency acting as a ""store of value not backed by a single country."" While he said that idea may sound silly to people living in more developed nations such as the U.S., Ohanian believes the real value of cryptocurrency is its ability to secure and transfer assets across national borders, especially for countries that are less economically stable.  ""In so many states, there are uncertainties about government and money. And people see their lives savings disappear. There’s a real value of having a currency that - as volatile as bitcoin is - are still potentially less volatile than some of the states that see hyper inflation,"" Ohanian said, adding:  ""For so many people in the world to have that security of knowing what’s yours is yours - because it [cryptocurrency] is now digital, it can be transferred with you wherever you are going - is actually pretty empowering.  Later in the show, Ohanian noted that he ceased managing the day-to-day operation of Reddit in January this year and has initiated a venture capital fund together with former Y Combinator partner Garry Tan.  As part of that effort, Ohanian and Tan have also recently participated in a funding round for the sharing economy blockchain startup Origin through a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) sale as previously reported by CoinDesk.

42401503,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcztSU,1525874418,EOS Looks Poised for a Move Toward Record Highs,"EOS seems to be preparing for a move back toward all-time highs, price chart analysis indicates.  The cryptocurrency's pullback from the April 29 record high of $23.03 on the Bitfinex exchange ran out of steam near $15.71 – the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the March 18 low of $3.87 to April 29 high.  Stepping back a bit, the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement is one of the three golden ratios of technical analysis, with the others being 50 and 61.8 percent. They are often considered strong support/resistance levels. If prices break below the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level, then the next support is the 50 percent, followed by 61.8 percent.  However, if the 38.2 percent support level holds, as is the case with EOS currently, then it is considered a sign a pullback has run its course.  EOS daily chart  As seen in the chart above, EOS bounced-off from near 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement support on May 1 and seems to have built a base around $16.30 in the eight days since.  Notably, daily trading volumes have dropped sharply in the last two weeks, indicating the pullback is likely nothing more than a bout of profit-taking.  Further, the long-run momentum studies are biased bullish (sloping upwards). For instance, the 20-day and 50-day moving averages (MAs) are trending up and EOS is sitting well above those levels.  EOS/USD longs peak on Bitfinex  Interestingly, EOS/USD long trades on Bitfinex have risen to record highs, despite the pullback and recent sideways action in prices, indicating that dips are being viewed as buying opportunity.  Hence, EOS looks likely to scale the $20 mark soon and could have another go at the record high of $23.03 ahead of the mainnet launch, scheduled for June 2 – an event keenly anticipated by the community and investors.  As of writing, EOS is trading at $17.81 on Bitfinex – down 0.78 percent from the previous day's close of $17.95. The cryptocurrency notably rallied 193 percent in April and was the best performing top 25 cryptocurrency by market capitalization.  View  EOS could re-test $20.00 in a few days and may find acceptance above that psychological hurdle. In such a case, a rally to fresh record highs above $23.029 cannot be ruled out.  On the downside, a daily close below $15.71 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level) would signal the rally from the March 18 low of $3.87 has ended and could yield a deeper pullback to $11.19 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement).  Additionally, prices could suffer an exaggerated drop on even slightly bad news, courtesy of extreme positioning as represented by record EOS/USD long trades on Bitfinex.

42401502,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcztRV,1525867204,Bermuda's Blockchain Strategy Goes Beyond Just Winning New Business,"When it comes to regulating blockchain tech, bigger isn't always better – at least that's the thesis driving Bermuda's nascent regulatory efforts.  ""Small ships can turn quickly. That's the beauty of Bermuda,"" Premier David Burt told CoinDesk.  Bermuda is one of several small territories and microstates striving to leverage their nimble governments to attract blockchain and crypto businesses by creating regulatory certainty where other, larger governments have failed to deliver thus far. Liechtenstein, Malta, Gibraltar and, most recently, San Marino have joined the race alongside Bermuda, all offering proposals – and in some cases formal legislation – that promise ""comprehensive blockchain legislation.""  Typically such schemes entail detailed guidance on how initial coin offering (ICO) tokens will be viewed; secondary market controls; investor and consumer protections; and anti-money laundering (AML), know your customer (KYC) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) measures.  And to date, Bermuda's strategy has proved fruitful.  Since launching a blockchain task force in conjunction with the Bermuda Business Development Agency (BDA) in late 2017, the government has passed legislation on ICOs and created a regulatory sandbox for those companies, put forth a Digital Asset Business Act and partnered with BitFury to shift the island's property deeds system to the blockchain.  But most recently, and perhaps most notably, the U.K. territory inked a $15 million investment agreement with major crypto exchange Binance, demonstrating that the tiny island's blockchain push is attracting real industry heavyweights.  This result is one reason, Burt argues, that Bermuda stands apart from its peers.  ""We have a very simple mantra in my government, and it's 'show, don't tell,'"" Burt said.  But with the competition here fierce, Bermuda is attempting to diverge from other places luring crypto and blockchain startups by moving beyond regulation, and incorporating its blockchain aspirations into its own public policy agenda – including re-envisioning its youth education and immigration policies.  With this, Burt said:  ""We believe over the last nine months that our government has shown that not only are we open for business, but we mean business.""  The old with the new  Understanding Bermuda's blockchain strategy, and more importantly, what sets it apart also requires a historical view.  One feature which distinguishes the island from other aspiring hubs precedes the blockchain entirely – Bermuda's multi-billion dollar insurance and reinsurance industries which have ""full regulatory equivalence"" with both the U.S. and the EU.  The maturity of these industries means that there are existing robust investor protection measures and other pertinent rules that regulators have been able to build on to create the Digital Asset Business Act, explained Sean Moran, head of business development at the BDA.  ""We've had to tweak them, of course, to make them appropriate and fit for purpose for this industry,"" Moran told CoinDesk, ""but we have a model that we can work from that takes all of those protections and disclosures into account, and that's what we're working from.""  The dominance of Bermuda's reinsurance and insurance industries has also resulted in a burgeoning compliance-oriented sector, which Burt envisions as a critical resource for the blockchain businesses he hopes to attract.  ""If you cannot meet, match the Bermuda standards, if you cannot pass our high bar, then we don't want you,"" Burt said.  He explained that part of creating desirable regulatory conditions is implementing high compliance standards for companies that are made in consultation with industry players – like Binance, for example.  ""That is squarely in our sweet spot,"" Wayne Caines, Bermuda's minister of national security, told CoinDesk.  And that sweet spot will be especially beneficial for ICO issuers and the various stakeholders of that burgeoning industry. While industry has been waiting with baited breath for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to come out with formal guidance – since it was revealed that the regulator was closely investigating ICOs – Bermuda regulators have already set up a framework for those companies.  The territory will not only require ICO issuers to scrutinize potential investors, but Bermuda itself will also scrutinize the issuers by requiring them to outline beneficial ownership structures and to create more robust white papers.  According to John Narraway, an emerging technologies consultant at the BDA, this is particularly helpful since:  ""The regulations around what must be in an offering document or a white paper is critical because a white paper can be something like poetry or a haiku.""  He thinks this collection of standards will greatly mitigate the potential for Bermudian blockchain companies to engage in fraudulent activities.  And these regulations were also based off an existing regulation, the Companies Act, that officials merely tweaked.  ""We've kind of billed this as, if you will, the greenhouse off the side to start growing new things, but using the main house of structure and reputation with the success of the thing and the clarity that's going to come from that,"" John Narraway, emerging technologies consultant at the BDA said of the amendment.  Yet, those leading Bermuda's blockchain efforts are also cognizant of the industry's proclivity for rapid change, and believe their regulations are prepared to accommodate it.  ""Think of it like software versioning,"" Narraway suggested. ""We know it's not going to be 100 percent perfect, but it's going to be as best as it possibly can be. If we can go from whiteboard to legislation in two months, how long is it going to take us to issue a 'patch' – to use software terminology?""  He added:  ""We're going to have [version] 1.1 probably pretty quickly because we're going to be listening to the industry.""  Involving the locals  Likewise, another means by which the government plans to keep pace with the industry is by keeping communication lines open with the major industry players, and making sure to keep the island's citizens in mind.  For instance, the memorandum of understanding between Bermuda and Binance stipulates that the crypto exchange will not only move its compliance center to the island, but also invest $10 million into blockchain-related educational programs and $5 million in blockchain startups over the course of two to three years.  In return, Bermuda will work to provide a steady talent pool for the company.  ""We want to do it because we want those players and others to come into the market and create economic activity,"" Burt said of the deal.  Echoing Burt, Narraway said, the arrival of such companies can bring Bermuda up to speed with the industry by converting and capitalizing on local talent, and ideally abet the island's ""brain drain,"" whereby highly-skilled locals move to other places where the market for such talent is more competitive.  ""We want to be able to pull [young people] back in and give them opportunities, real opportunities, to participate in the economy and to grow it and to develop their careers,"" Narraway said.  According to Burt, the Bermudian government is in talks with other heavyweights from ""the entire space,"" though he declined to identify them. The officials plan to release further information on industry partners and legislation in upcoming weeks.  Narraway thinks local startups also stand to benefit, particularly because the industry presents new possibilities for raising early stage capital, which is in short supply on the island.  ""I can tell you from the business development side, we're having meetings every week with companies that are saying, 'I think I'm going to do this startup, this is where I want to go,' and now they're saying, 'explain to me this ICO as an option for doing my first round of funding,"" he said.

First revealed in March, the proof-of-concept (PoC) was developed with assistance from blockchain startup Clear and uses blockchain technology to automate the traditionally labor-intensive and costly inter-carrier settlement of wholesale international services, a press release states.  Now joining the trial are major telcos from the ITW Global Leaders’ Forum, including BT, HGC Global Communications, Telefonica and Telstra.  The initial effort focused on the settlement of wholesale voice minutes and used historical data in tests. In its latest iteration, the PoC will be bringing live data feeds into the blockchain system, which, the release says, allows data traffic to be automatically verified and settled between carriers.  Andrew Kwok, CEO of new member HGC, commented on the potential impact of the trial, saying that, if successful, the project would demonstrate ""a new business relationship among global carriers and reshape our business practice in the industry.""  According to Carl Grivner, CEO of Colt, utilizing live data was an important step following the success of the initial trial, one that would ""prove the use case for blockchain technology"" in the telecom industry.  Grivner continued:  ""Not only did the second iteration of the PoC do what was intended – accurately match and settle wholesale traffic independently with live information – but it also signals the future of telecoms, whereby previously intensive manual practices can be securely automated to allow businesses such as Colt to invest resources into driving both our and our customer’s businesses forward.""

42401482,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAczt9n,1525860022,China's Security Ministry Touts Blockchain for Evidence Storage,"China's Ministry of Public Security has developed a blockchain system aimed to more securely store evidence collected during police investigations.  According to data released by China's Intellectual Property Office on Tuesday, the ministry's research arm filed a patent application in November 2017 for a blockchain-based system that timestamps and stores data submitted to the cloud in a bid to provide a more transparent and tamper-proof deposition procedure.  With centralized cloud platforms becoming an increasingly popular way to share data, the ministry – which supervises all China's police forces – said a potential problem with the current deposition process is that evidence sent via cloud providers could easily be altered.  In addition, the lack of an efficient technology to provide clear supervision of the cloud storage process could also make the deposition process less reliable.  As such, the patent sets out a blockchain system that would initially request that cloud providers be sent deposition data, which, after receiving multi-signature confirmations from both parties, would be recorded and timestamped on a blockchain. In this way, the system would provide an immutable copy of the data, as well as who initiated the transaction and the time and date it occurred.  Although the technology described in the application doesn't appear to be entirely novel, given it largely reflects the basic mechanisms of standard blockchains, it still marks a notable use case exploration by one of the 26 cabinet-level ministries of China's State Council.  Further, the Ministry of Public Security is not the only Chinese government agency that is interested in taking advantages of blockchain technology.  As reported previously by CoinDesk, China's National Audit Office, another cabinet-level ministry and also the government's official auditing authority, is also looking at blockchain solutions for storing audit data it gathers from provincial and local level bureaus.

42401498,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcztPX,1525856408,Topping Out? Bitcoin Bulls Need to Defend $9K,"Having hit seven-day lows below $9,000 this morning, bitcoin (BTC) is looking decidedly weak.  The cryptocurrency fell to $8,980 on Bitfinex a few hours ago and was last seen changing hands at $9,080 – down 1.13 percent from the previous day's close (as per UTC) of $9,184.  The downwards move does not come as a surprise, however, with the bear flag breakdown witnessed yesterday opening the doors for a fall to $8,865.  Now, unless the bulls can make a defense of support at $9,055 (seen in chart below), the cryptocurrency risks once more falling below $8,000.  4-hour chart  Bitcoin risks a deeper sell-off to $8,652 (April 26 low) if the failure to beat inverse head-and-shoulders neckline hurdle (as seen over the weekend) is followed by a 4-hour close below the trendline support, currently seen at $9,055.  The 50-candle and 100-candle moving averages (MAs) have shed bullish bias (topped out) and BTC is trading well below other key moving averages. Meanwhile, the relative strength index (RSI) is holding well below 50.00 (in the bearish territory), also signaling scope for further losses.  Additionally, the action in the hourly chart below also suggests that BTC is risking a move downwards.  Hourly chart        As of writing, BTC is trading on a weaker footing as indicated by the series of lower highs and lower lows, represented by the falling channel (bearish pattern).  The 50-hour, 100-hour and 200-hour MAs are all biased to the bears (trending south). The bear flag breakdown, seen yesterday, also favors a drop below $9,055.  The only factor that might stall the decline is the bullish relative strength index (RSI) divergence. Note that the RSI has not formed lower lows in response to lower lows in prices.  View  BTC will likely find acceptance below $9,055 (trendline support in the 4-hour chart) and drop towards $8,652 (April 26 low).  A daily close (as per UTC) below $8,652 would mean the rally from the April 1 low of $6,425 has ended and the bears have regained control. In this case, BTC could extend the decline to $7,787 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from $6,425 to $9,990).  However, an upside break of the falling channel seen in the hourly chart could yield a rally to $9,300.  Meanwhile, a close (as per UTC) above the 10-day MA, seen today at $9,413 would indicate the pullback from the recent high of $9,990 has ended.

42401484,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcztAm,1525852820,SEC Commissioner Cautions Against 'Blanket' ICO Classification,"A sandbox for ICOs is not the best approach to token regulation, an SEC commissioner said last week.  Speaking at the Medici Conference on May 2, Commissioner Hester Peirce told the audience:  ""My fear that regulators will grab hold of the shovels and buckets is why I am often wary of so-called regulatory sandboxes. I am entirely in favor of finding ways to make appropriate regulatory allowances that clear the way for innovation to flourish. What troubles me about sandboxes, however, is that the regulator is typically sitting there next to the entrepreneurs.""  Peirce went on to argue in her ICO-focused speech that ""open communication"" between regulators and those they regulate is possible without a sandbox, and instead advocated for a ""lifeguard"" approach in which the regulator ""watches over what is happening, but she is not sitting with sandcastle builders monitoring their every design decision.""  Peirce did, however, acknowledge that sandboxes have been successful for some regulators, including those in the U.K., the U.A.E. and Singapore.  Blockchain sandboxes have become increasingly popular amongst global regulators, and advocates argue that they are a means of satisfying regulators without quashing innovation. Lithuania, Bermuda and Malta are among other countries experimenting with the idea.  In another notable part of the speech, the Commissioner broke with SEC Chairman Jay Clayton's statement at a U.S. Senate hearing in February in which he stated, ""I believe every ICO I've seen is a security.""  Contrarily, Peirce remarked: ""Given the undeveloped nature of this area, I am wary of any blanket designation for all ICOs."" She instead suggested that regulators ""evaluate the facts and circumstances of each offering.""  The Commissioner also addressed the potential for regulation to impact innovation and argued that the classification of tokens as securities, for example, could create boundaries for innovation.  ""They will, over time, come to look more and more like securities and securities offering. Innovations that might otherwise have occurred that don't fit within that 'security' framework may never come to fruition,"" she told event attendees.  Additionally, Peirce expressed regret that the SEC has largely communicated with ICO issuers via its Division of Enforcement and cautioned that the Commission should not lead ""with its enforcement powers."" She also suggested that the SEC set up a website to field questions and comments on ICOs, tokens, blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.

The company outlined a system that can execute transactions for ETPs holding cryptocurrencies ""such as bitcoins ... ripple, dogecoins ... ether"" as well as BBQCoin, among others, according to patent published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Tuesday. The company first filed the application in December of last year.  ETPs, which include exchange-traded-funds (ETF), are a type of security whose prices derive from other investment instruments they are tied to, which in the Winklevoss case, would be cryptocurrencies.  The patent reward is notable as it provides a glimpse into the Winklevoss brothers' continuing efforts to push forward the trading of cryptocurrency-related ETFs after having met hurdles from U.S. regulators.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has rejected the brothers' last bid in March 2017 that sought to list a bitcoin-tied ETF on the Bats BZX Exchange, citing risk associated with the trading and regulatory uncertainty.  Currently, the SEC has yet to green-light any bitcoin-related ETFs on exchanges. And in January this year, several firms that were proposing a rule change to the SEC had also withdrawn their filings per requirement by the securities regulator.  Today's patent reward also comes just a month after the Winklevoss IP won another patent claim for strengthening cryptocurrencies' transaction security that could be used in the Gemini exchange, as previously reported by CoinDesk.

42401496,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcztMa,1525838441,Bitcoin Lightning Payments Are Slowly Becoming Less 'Reckless',"You're running a full bitcoin node, know Linux and have decent command line skills. Okay? Cool, go ahead and spin up a Docker instance.  If that sounds intimidating, you're not alone.  But as recently as January, using the lightning network, a layer-two technology for scaling bitcoin, on ""mainnet"" – i.e., with real money – called for these rarified levels of technical expertise. Not to mention a strong stomach – bugs lurked in early implementations, threatening to part users from their funds (early adopters boasted of their prowess with the slogan #reckless).  Luckily, the lightning network, which pushes transactions into off-chain payment channels, allowing the cryptocurrency to be received without waiting for a block to be mined or paying the associated miner's fees, has moved ahead by leaps and bounds in the past few months.  As such, hopes are running high.  For instance, ACINQ, the company behind the ""eclair"" lightning implementation, unveiled an Android wallet app at the beginning of April that can be used to send mainnet lightning payments. But the app can't receive payments yet.  And Lightning Labs, the company behind the ""lnd"" implementation of the lightning network, recently published a blog post envisioning non-techy end-user Carol buying a pair of socks using lightning as easily as if she were swiping a credit card.  In short, lightning promises to bring bitcoin back to the days when it could be used to buy a pizza.  Indeed, the newest beta version of Lightning Labs' lnd is, in fact, ready for mainnet use, but the company recently tweeted, ""we recommend that users experiment with only small amounts (#craefulgang #craefulgang #craefulgang)!"" playing off a joke in John Oliver's recent bit about cryptocurrency.  To minimize the risk for users, Lightning Labs has not released a mobile version, and the desktop app is still restricted to ""testnet"" – that is, fake money. Same with the lnd wallet for iOS called Zap; the lightning wallet, HTLC.me, developed by well-known developer Alex Bosworth; and another iOS wallet for lightning, called CoinClip, released by developer Kenneth Perry, aka thothonegan.  Still, the frenzy of developer activity on lightning network will continue to push its rapid development, but for noobs – whom polite society calls ""inexperienced users"" – it's still a waiting game.  Although Jack Mallers, the developer behind a testnet lnd wallet for iOS called Zap, isn't getting discouraged. With optimism, he told CoinDesk, lightning will soon be good enough for more non-technical users, adding:  ""One day it will be good enough for exchanges, one day it will be good enough for Amazon.""  With that said, though, there's still no official launch date for a lightning network application that everyday people can use.  ""We're so used to roadmaps of products where there's a deadline,"" Mallers continued, but lightning is ""a protocol and not a product so there's not a ship date.""  Watchtowers and submarines?  Would-be lightning wallet users will have to wait until several highly technical features – with strange names – are ironed out.  One of the most important, Mallers said, is ""watchtowers.""  In the way that the lightning network's smart contracts are designed, it is possible for one user of a channel to steal another user's funds. While it is risky – since if the victim logs on before a given amount of time has passed and notices, they can then punish the would-be thief by taking all their funds in the channel – Lightning Labs is going a step further, building watchtowers.  These all-seeing nodes will watch the network and punish anyone who attempts to steal their counterparty's bitcoin, in exchange for a small fee.  Beyond that basic guarantee of safety, there are other improvements a wallet app would need to make before it's ready for everyday use.  For instance, several developers are working on a mechanism called ""splicing,"" which would allow a user that wants to send more bitcoin than they have available in their channel to bring additional funds into the channel to make the payment. This mechanism is also being developed by Lightning Labs to enable bitcoin users without a lightning node to receive lightning-based payments.  Then there are features that might not be totally necessary, but would certainly be nifty.  Bosworth, for instance, is working on a feature called ""submarine swaps,"" a version of atomic swaps whereby one side of the swap is being done on-chain and one side of the swap done off-chain.  With the use the lightning network's ability to lock up funds in a smart contract, lightning network users could theoretically swap between bitcoin and litecoin, for example.  The technology could, Bosworth believes, could enable lightning use on decentralized exchanges as well, since even though users need a ""swap provider,"" that provider ""can't take your altcoins without giving you the bitcoin back because of that lock,"" Bosworth told CoinDesk.  The 'usability challenge'  As important as this technical plumbing is, though, some argue that these are just the tip of the iceberg when compared to outstanding user experience issues.  ""Lightning has a ton of challenges ahead of it. I don't want to be too negative. It's amazing stuff,"" said The Hebrew University assistant professor Aviv Zohar, adding:  ""But there's this huge gap between what's doable and what's usable: the usability challenge.""  Case in point, Zohar thinks there are a number of problems with the lightning network user experience that don't have solutions yet.  For instance, when users create a channel, they need a certain number of confirmations to make sure its been accepted, and as such, the user needs to keep monitoring the channel. And while he admits the watchtower concept will improve this, that feature will likely take some time to be built into a sleek UX.  Plus, Zohar continued, ""If you drop a phone in the toilet or something, what happens with your lightning channel?""  An edge case, perhaps, but overall, lightning's user interfaces are far worse even than bitcoin's – though admittedly bitcoin's had far more time – and even bitcoin's user experience still isn't that intuitive.  That will likely continue to be the case, Zohar believes, since there just aren't a whole lot of people working on UX for cryptocurrency protocols and technologies.  Yet some, like Igor Cota, have noticed the problem and are working on it. For his part, Cota is working on a lightning wallet called Presto that would enable near-field communication (NFC) – the technology behind contactless payments which allow users to merely tap their mobile devices to payment terminals to initiate transactions.  Speaking to CoinDesk about the benefits of simple, seamless lightning use, Cota said:  ""I strongly believe that a focus on UX and general ease of use are what is going to bring lightning (and bitcoin) to mainstream.""
