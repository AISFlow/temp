42401797,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2WyI,1534806011,Senior BitConnect Promotor Arrested by Indian Authorities,"A promoter of the controversial cryptocurrency platform BitConnect was arrested on August 19, according to a local news outlet in India.  Former BitConnect India head Divyesh Darji was arrested at Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi on Sunday, the India Express reported. The Criminal Investigation Department of Gujurat police announced they arrested Darji after receiving an alert from the nation's immigration agency.  According to P. G. Narwade, an inspector from the police department, Darji was en route from Dubai to the city of Ahmedabad when he was arrested.  He said:  ""The accused held seminars, events in India and other countries promising high interest — daily interest rate of 1 percent — on investment in BitConnect coins. The cost of one BitConnect coin on January 16, 2018, when the company shut down, was USD 362.""  As CoinDesk reported, BitConnect's lending service was shut down this past January after regulators in Texas and North Carolina said the company was engaging in the sale of unregistered securities tied to a token sale. The shutdown resulted in the startup's BCC token's price crashing, falling from its high of $400 at the beginning of the year to $17.25 on Jan. 17. The token is trading below 70 cents as of press time.  In addition to the unregistered security sale, BitConnect was also infamously accused of conducting a Ponzi scheme, particularly after several prominent figures in the crypto community levied criticisms against it, including the founder of ethereum, Vitalik Buterin.  After the platform's shutdown, former BitConnect investor and promoter Trevon James said the FBI had begun investigating the project, according to a YouTube video he posted in March.

42401794,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2WvL,1534800629,"SBCVC, Baidu Lead $3 Million Funding for Ex-Googler's Crypto Startup","A team led by a former Google staffer is taking aim at the online advertising giant.  Called Atlas Protocol, the startup believes that the data accumulating on blockchains today can be used to better market to internet users tomorrow, an idea that has already received validation from some of the biggest names in Asian business.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, SBCVC has completed a $3 million equity seed round in Atlas. Other participants include BV (the venture charm of Chinese internet conglomerate, Baidu), Danhua Capital and Fenbushi Capital.  Google, of course, earns the lion's share of its money by gathering data about user behavior and using it to advertise to them all over the web, while users have very little control over how much data the company collects about them. As such, Atlas is positioning itself to come out ahead of Google if more of the web begins directly interacting with public blockchains.  The Atlas team knows the Google playbook well. It was incubated by the xGoogler Blockchain Alliance, an organization made up of former Google employees now deeply involved in building out the blockchain ecosystem.  Project co-founder Duran Liu is himself a former staffer at Google, working on improving different applications at the search giant with machine learning. Liu's co-founder Cheng Li was also part of Google NYC, working on applications like speech recognition.  With the attention paid to Facebook's Cambridge Analyitica scandal and credit rating agency Equifax's data breach before it, users might be understandably wary about personal data being stored immutably on a blockchain.  Atlas Protocol has sought to allay those concerns by promising that users will control their data and only share the information that they opt-in to share. In a Medium post addressing how blockchain technology could help marketing teams abide by Europe's new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the firm promises:  ""Being implemented on the blockchain, Atlas Protocol will be fully transparent for users, in contrast to the 'data blackhole' setup that characterizes the current industry landscape dominated by digital giants.""  Atlas's roadmap says it is aiming for a beta release this summer.  Competitive terrain  The basic model for Atlas Protocol is to allow users to collect data about transactions and interactions with the blockchain, and then allow marketers to incentivize sharing that information by using a token that can permit value exchange between marketers, users, publishers and others in the online ecosystem.  Other companies are also working to tie ads to the blockchain, for the benefit of users.  MetaX has adChain, a token curated registry of high quality publishing opportunities, while the team at Brave has the Basic Attention Token, which will eventually pay for ads that don't know who you are. It's an important enough topic that the online advertising industry's trade group, IAB, has created a working group on the topic.  Also notable is that Atlas was incubated by Nebulas, a top 100 blockchain protocol that wants to make crypto data more discoverable and useable.  Atlas completed a proof-of-concept as part of the Nebulas incentive program this summer after Nebulas encouraged developers to build decentralized apps or dapps on its blockchain. The apps that saw the most usage got the best rewards. To make sure they had users, Liu explained that Atlas Protocol's ""SmartDrop system"" was used to reward the most active Nebulas users during the incentive program with free tokens as well.  Over 100,000 users received NAS tokens this way, according to a statement.  UPDATE (2018, 22 Month 24:20 UTC): A previous version of this story used the former name of SBCVC, SoftBank China Venture Capital, to describe the leader of this round. It is not part of Japan's SoftBank Group.

First proposed in March  , the Virtual Commodity Association aims to ""foster financially sound, responsible and innovative virtual commodity markets"" by developing industry standards and encouraging cryptocurrency exchanges to prevent market manipulation and other fraudulent actions.  On Monday, the proposal took its next step, with Gemini launching a working group to begin developing these standards.  As explained by an introductory post on the VCA's website, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has legal jurisdiction over commodities, such as bitcoin and ether, though it does not necessarily have jurisdiction over cash and spot markets derived from commodities.  However, under the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), the CFTC can regulate fraud or market manipulation.  The post explained  :  ""The purchase and sale of commodities in the spot/cash markets has been historically exempt from the CEA and CFTC jurisdiction. Nevertheless, cash markets for virtual commodities – as it is a less well known industry – can benefit from an additional layer of oversight. We believe that adding this layer can provide even more protection for consumers and ensure the integrity of these markets and growing industry.""  To that end, the VCA will appoint a board of directors to oversee the organization, which will commit to remaining a non-profit, independent group that can ""help set and adopt global standards and best practices.""

42381104,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93v4V,1534792854,The SEC Is Weighing a Bitcoin Futures ETF – Here's What That Means,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will decide on two proposed bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) this week – but what are they weighing exactly?  ProShares, the tenth largest provider of ETFs according to CNBC, has two proposals in the running, both based upon bitcoin futures contracts approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in 2017.  What's more, this impending decision comes at the heels of a more recent ruling by the SEC to delay (until September, if not longer) their determination on a physical-backed bitcoin ETF put forth by VanEck and SolidX.  The distinction between the two, a physical and futures-backed ETF, is worth unpacking to understand the ProShares proposal – aside from whether bitcoin ETFs should or shouldn't be approved in the U.S. – centers on which among the two actually has a better shot at SEC approval.  What's a bitcoin ETF?  To recap, all ETFs trade like stocks, on stock exchanges, but without the same degree of risk.  Due to their design, they're often a favored instrument for those who want to diversify their investments, offering exposure that's closer to what you would see in an index fund.  This is because, when you're buying a share of an ETF, you don't actually own the underlying shares of the asset (in this case bitcoin). Instead, you own a piece of the fund and how the fund is structured and where the money goes.  ""Part of the money when you buy a fund goes to pay for the company that set up the fund and manages the fund. It's the fund's money, and the fund owns these assets and, by definition, the fund,"" Eric Ross, chief strategist at Cascend Securities, explained.  With a physical-backed bitcoin ETF, investors can effectively participate in the crypto market without being in direct possession of any coins, thereby avoiding some of the risks associated with handling bitcoin private keys (the pieces of information required to actually transfer bitcoins).  Futures-backed bitcoin ETFs take this level of separation one step further by basing the shares in the fund on bitcoin futures contracts as opposed to actual bitcoins themselves.  A futures contract sets a fixed price and date to trade an asset. As such, depending on an investor's outlook on how the markets will move over time, he or she can buy contracts at varying prices to reflect that outlook and, if correct, make returns on their investment.  In this way, certain futures-backed bitcoin ETFs can indeed prove profitable for investors even if the bitcoin markets are looking bearish. Additionally, holding futures contracts with set prices and expiration dates hold lower degrees of risk given that the company issuing bitcoin ETFs wouldn't have to make efforts to safeguard any bitcoin assets from theft or hack.  'Physical' vs futures  As a result then, it doesn't come as much of a surprise that among the 10 bitcoin-related funds that are concurrently undergoing review by SEC officials in the next two months, only one is a physical-backed bitcoin ETF, suggesting most companies are placing their bets on approval of a futures-backed trading option as opposed to physical.  Daniel Masters, executive chairman for CoinShares, explained to CoinDesk in early August:  ""Until such time major institutions put their name to cryptocurrency custody, I don't believe a physical ETF can exist in the U.S...I think any futures backed ETF in the United States now has a far better chance of being approved.""  Although, from a strictly operational standpoint, Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, points out that it is widely understood ""where the investors have a choice of buying the ETF that hold the futures versus the ones that physically holds it...95% of the people go to the physical one, the only time they hold the one that holds futures are if they have to.""  ""I take the one that actually holds the bitcoin will be more successful and you don't have to deal with rolling futures. There could be some costs associated with that people don't like,"" he added.  These costs mentioned by Balchunas go back to how the fund issuing ETFs will make a sustainable profit. By holding bitcoin ETF futures contracts, the fund will often have to maintain a ""rolling position,"" buying contracts at high early prices and later selling these contracts closer to expiry at comparatively low prices. Otherwise known as the ""cost of carry,"" Balchunas notes that in Bloomberg's ""traffic lights system"" anything that rolls futures is given a red light to denote high risk.  For Balchunas, on top of other potential concerns by critics who attack cryptocurrencies for having no intrinsic value, futures-backed bitcoin ETFs add ""another laying of complication and risk that you don't need when you already have all these other issues.""  Market impact  Still, one thing is for certain: the market impact of a bitcoin ETF – if and when approved by the SEC – will be a significant one.  Masters, whose firm offers exchange-traded notes for crypto assets including bitcoin and ether, explained how ETFs could effectively enable a new class of participants to invest in the technology.  ""Our customers are individuals, family offices, hedge funds that acquire our products through regulated marketplaces and often that might be insurance-based or pension-based. [Our notes] appeal to a very traditional set of investors,"" he remarked.  And that's appealing also to the many crypto enthusiasts in the U.S. who want to see cryptocurrencies move beyond the fringes of the finance industry and into the mainstream.  For his part, Balchunas sees the entry of a bitcoin ETF as a potentially market-boosting one, explaining:  ""If a coin-based bitcoin ETF comes out, I would see it getting to probably $5 billion within a year and then ultimately would be a pretty big product probably maybe $10 to $15 billion over the next couple years and that would put it in the top 10 percent biggest ETFs.""  However, Masters isn't exactly bullish that the U.S. will move quickly on approving cryptocurrency-based ETFs, adding that ""the ruleset in America is meaningfully more complex. In the U.S. things tend to be a lot more structured from day one.""

Gartner included blockchain, along with four other emerging technologies, as one of five trends that can blur the lines between humans and machines, according to a news release on August 20. Blockchain technology is at the edge of the ""trough of disillusionment"" phase in the cycle, though it predicts that the technology may reach the ""plateau of productivity"" within the next decade.  The ""trough of disillusionment"" means that ""interest [in the technology] wanes as experiments and implementations fail to deliver. Producers of the technology shake out or fail. Investments continue only if the surviving providers improve their products to the satisfaction of early adopters,"" as explained on Gartner's website.  Mike Walker, research vice president at Gartner, said in a news release that ""digitalized ecosystem technologies are making their way to the Hype Cycle fast,"" adding:  ""Blockchain and [internet of things] platforms have crossed the peak by now, and we believe that they will reach maturity in the next five to 10 years, with digital twins and knowledge graphs on their heels.""  The ""shift from compartmentalized technical infrastructure to ecosystem-enabling platforms,"" as written in the news release, is building the fundamentals for unique business models as the technology stabilizes in the future.  In addition to blockchain technology, which is part of the ""digitalized ecosystems,"" four other distinct emerging technology trends that are listed on the hype cycle are ""democratized AI,"" ""do-it-yourself biohacking,"" ""transparently immersive experiences"" and ""ubiquitous infrastructure,"" according to the release.  The Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies report is the longest-running annual Gartner Hype Cycle, according to Gartner's website, and it serves to provide a cross-industry perspective on the technologies and trends.

42413906,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAmcl2,1534779010,SEC Faces Thursday Deadline for ProShares Bitcoin ETF Decision,"Less than a month after delaying a decision on a bitcoin-based exchange-traded fund (ETF), the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is poised to approve or disapprove another pair of proposed ETFs.  Officials at the U.S. securities regulator are set to make a decision on the ProShares Bitcoin ETF and the ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF by Thursday, August 23. Unlike this month's earlier decision to push an approval for the Cboe's VanEck/SolidX bitcoin ETF, this rule change proposal – filed by ProShares in conjunction with NYSE Arca – cannot be delayed any further under the regulator's rules.  The ProShares ETF proposals – initially submitted to the SEC last December – are underpinned by bitcoin futures contracts, rather than any physical holdings of bitcoin itself. In other words, the ETF's value will be determined by the bitcoin futures contracts trading on CME or the Cboe Futures Exchange, according to the original filing.  ProShares originally proposed the futures-based ETFs in September 2017, but noted at the time that the futures market was young and ""there can be no assurance that an active trading market for bitcoin futures contracts will develop or be maintained,"" according to the filing.  The ProShares Trust previously asked the SEC to withdraw a proposed rule change filed on Dec. 19, 2017 which outlined the ProShares Bitcoin and Short Bitcoin ETFs, as well as the ProShares Bitcoin Futures/Equity Strategy ETF and the ProShares Bitcoin/Blockchain Strategy ETF.  The withdrawal request came after the SEC pushed back against a number of ETF proposals, citing concerns about bitcoin's volatility at the time. Direxion Shares, VanEck and First Trust Advisors also withdrew a number of similar bitcoin ETF proposals at the time.  However, the SEC later announced it was considering the futures-pinned proposals at the end of January.  To date, the regulator has only denied or delayed bitcoin ETF proposals, with the latest denial coming last month when it rejected a proposal filed by Gemini founders and long-time bitcoin investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.  The proposal had already been rejected in the spring of 2017, but the Bats BZX Exchange, which submitted the proposal, filed an appeal that was later heard by SEC commissioners.

42381114,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93vJb,1534769999,Bitcoin's Lightning Network Is Getting Its Own Hacker Camp,"You're scrolling through an online electronic store, when a new drone catches your eye.  Eager to fly it for real, you enter a string of numbers to submit your payment. You're not thinking at all about how, behind the scenes, it's bitcoin that makes the impulse purchase possible.  Far-fetched today? Maybe, but that's the sort of easy user experience the bitcoin developers at Chaincode Labs think is missing from the world of cryptocurrency, even now that a much-anticipated technology layer known as the Lightning Network is in beta. While it's perhaps bitcoin's best shot at reaching mainstream adoption, it's not exactly easy to use today, or as easy as developers envision it could be.  That's why the group, led by veterans Alex Morcos and Matt Corallo, has held similar coding programs focused exclusively on bitcoin. Developers from around the world travel to New York to learn about the intricate details of the protocol and its most essential code.  However, announced Monday, Chaincode is launching a new ""residency"" in New York from October 22 to 26, one that will focus on helping developers build their own Lightning Network apps.  The goal, according to Chaincode engineer and bitcoin software maintainer Marco Falke, is for the program to create tech ""for normal people on the street, not just weird developers."" In short, they're looking for some fresh blood. Any and all experienced web developers are welcome to apply – no bitcoin expertise required.  Falke told continued:  ""There aren't many apps and you can't go into a shop and pay with bitcoin. There's all this missing infrastructure. We thought it would be great to get some app developers involved that have experience building websites, but don't have to have any background in bitcoin or lightning.""  Though, it's worth noting a few lightning apps have already sprung up showing how bitcoin and lightning can be paired to improve online payments. Even so, the developers at Chaincode hope the one-week bootcamp will spur even more apps.  Teachers will include some of the more well-known lightning developers in the space, including Blockstream engineer Christian Decker and engineer Elaine Ou.  What the residency's about  But while Chaincode calls the program a ""residency,"" its program sounds similar to a coding bootcamp, an increasingly common way of teaching coding skills in a short period of time.  This bootcamp is traditional in some ways, of course, as the team will take applications until they ""reach capacity"" of roughly 12 students. However, from there, the class will focus on lightning specifically.  The six instructors will each give a presentation on the protocol. But they'll also be around for the full residency, helping out students as they have questions. That's because for most of the residency, participants will have time to work on an app of their choosing.  The app can be anything they want – a fun game like Satoshis.place, where users fight over pixel drawings, or something more serious, like an app allowing users to pay for monthly bills.  At the end of the week, participants will demo what they've made to the rest of the group.  Soon after the residency the Chaincode team will release recordings of all the presentations, for those who can't make it out to New York City for the bootcamp.  App focus  Though a small program, for the industry, it perhaps sends a stronger signal, as Lightning developers have been mostly focused on getting the underlying lightning protocol off the ground to date.  But Chaincode's developers believe that maybe the ecosystem could use more application developers now that there's an increasing emphasis on the code's usability.  ""Personally, I think every day we wait for lightning applications will delay lightning and bitcoin. It's really important to do this app development thing as soon as possible,"" Falke continued.  Chaincode engineer James O'Beirne went so far as to argue that the applications could be key to shifting public perception of bitcoin, which has largely been on its speculative value of late.  ""A lot of people outside of bitcoin don't understand it's capabilities, including lightning. By facilitating app development we're spreading awareness of what bitcoin is actually capable of,"" O'Beirne said. ""People have turned to other smart contract platforms because they don't understand how powerful bitcoin can be.""  Falke nodded in agreement: ""Some people don't think lightning is a real thing.""

42381106,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93v71,1534766459,SBI Holdings Again Invests in Crypto Exchange Under Scrutiny,"SBI Holdings, the investment arm of Japanese financial giant SBI Group, is making a new round of investment in a cryptocurrency exchange that's under increased scrutiny from the country's financial regulator.  The investment firm said in a release on Monday that it's increasing its stake in Japanese exchange LastRoots via an undisclosed investment, following an initial capital injection in December 2017. The goal of the latest funding, according to the announcement, is to help the exchange enhance its internal business systems in order for it to become a licensed trading venue.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, LastRoots was one of a number of unlicensed cryptocurrency exchanges that have been probed by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) in the months following the $520 million Coincheck exchange heist in January.  LastRoots was issued with an FSA business improvement order in April, after the agency decided the platform had insufficient measures in place to protect users against potential cyber threats.  In addition to the new capital, SBI Holdings said it will supply its own staff to support LastRoots in beefing up its internal risk management systems and anti-money laundering measures.  The move follows news that SBI's in-house crypto exchange had officially started offering trading services to the public in mid-July after receiving a license from the FSA. The launch made it one of the first crypto exchanges in Japan to be backed by a major financial institution.  Back in March, SBI Holdings also invested in Taiwan-based cryptocurrency hardware wallet maker CoolBitX and, a month later, backed token exchange Templum's $10 million funding round.

42381120,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93vPt,1534762836,Bitcoin Awaits Decisive Move as Price Range Tightens,"Bitcoin (BTC) is stuck in a narrowing price range and the direction of the next breakout is far from certain.      The leading cryptocurrency was expected to rise toward $7,000 over the weekend, having moved past a key technical hurdle on Friday. However, contrary to expectations, BTC failed to absorb supply around $6,600 in the last 48 hours.      Even so, the rejection at $6,600 has not proved costly, and BTC's bears have struggled to bring the cryptocurrency below the psychological support of $6,300.      BTC is now being squeezed into a tight $300 trading range and is changing hands at $6,400 on Bitfinex at press time – up 0.80 percent on a 24-hour basis.    4-hour chart    As of writing, the pennant resistance (top end) is located at $6,595 and the support (lower end) is seen at $6,320.      A bullish breakout would be confirmed if the 4-hour candle closes above $6,595. That would add credence to the bullish relative strength index divergence (RSI) and a beach of a key falling trendline witnessed earlier this month and would open the doors to a stronger rally towards $7,000 (psychological hurdle).      However, the bears could feel emboldened if the 4-hour candle closes below $6,320. In this case, BTC could drop below $6,000 (February low). It's worth noting that a downside break of the pennant would push the RSI below the rising channel support and that would only validate the bearish price pattern.    Daily chart    That said, the overall bias as per the daily chart remains bearish as long as the cryptocurrency is trading below the ascending trendline drawn from the June 29 low and July 12 low. At press time, both the rising trendline and 100-day MA are located at $7,067.    View  A bull pennant breakout will likely allow a rally to $7,000. The outlook as per the daily chart would turn bullish if prices find acceptance above $7,067 (rising trendline hurdle seen in the daily chart).  A pennant breakdown would shift risk in favor of a drop to $6,000 (February low).  The support at $5,859 (Aug. 14 low) and $5,755 (June 29 low) would come into play if the bulls fail to defend $6,000.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

According to an announcement from the Department of Justice in the Southern District of California, Jacob Burrell Campos was ordered to be held without bail at a hearing on Friday in connection to the charges.  Based on a court filing against him entered on Aug. 8 and unsealed over the weekend, the prosecutors alleged that, from January 2015 to April 2016, Burrell sold about $750,000 worth of bitcoin to 900 individuals in the U.S. via his bitcoin exchange service.  The document said Burrell had not registered the exchange as a licensed money transmitter and intentionally failed to implement anti-money laundering measures. As such, he was accused of one count of illegal money transmission and one count of money laundering.  Further, the prosecutors said in order to fund his ""illegal"" bitcoin exchange, Burrell committed a total 28 counts of international money laundering. From February 2015 to February 2016, Burrell allegedly wired at least $900,000 in 30 transactions from his bank accounts in the U.S. to Hong Kong-based crypto exchange Bitfinex to buy bitcoin.  The transfers were allegedly conducted in an effort to avoid ID verification processes after Burrell's trading account with U.S.-based crypto exchange Coinbase was closed, the document said.  The prosecutors said in the announcement:  ""Burrell's activities 'blew a giant hole' through the legal framework of U.S. anti-money laundering laws by soliciting and introducing into the U.S. banking system close to $1 million in unregulated cash.""  The defendant is also facing a further charge of structuring international instrument transactions to evade reporting, when he tried to smuggle around $1 million from Mexico into the U.S.  If Burrell is convicted on any of the money laundering charges, the U.S. government plans to forfeit ""any property, real and personal, involved in such offense, and any property traceable to such property.""

42381107,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93vAn,1534752027,Losing the Lambos: It's Time to Get Serious About Crypto's Big Questions,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      ""Crypto in crisis.""  Mainstream press outlets covering battered crypto markets have frequently invoked that phrase in recent weeks. For those of us who've followed the cryptocurrency scene for five years or more, the natural retort is: ""When hasn't it been in crisis?""  I would suggest that crisis – or at least relentless, chaotic drama – is the natural state for an open-source technology that engages a diverse, global, leaderless community in exploring an idea that promises to reorganize the fabric of our economy.  The outcome of this grand experiment is unknowable. But if we accept that the prospect of replacing 5,000 years of centralized record-keeping with a decentralized model of computerized consensus is rife with transformative potential, then we must also accept that it will generate wild, impossible-to-measure predictions, along with rampant speculation and hype.  By extension, these will frequently also generate fear and disappointment, and, unavoidably, price volatility.  The other thing you'll hear from crypto ""veterans"" – yes, just five years in bitcoinland qualifies you for that title – is that crisis, and bitcoin's capacity to survive it, is precisely what proves its worth.  The meme most frequently used to describe this resilient quality is that of bitcoin as the honey badger. But I prefer Andreas Antonopoulos's ""sewer rat"" analogy: bitcoin as a tough-as-nails subterranean rodent that has proven it can take what the world throws at it.  Our increasingly distributed, fragmented economy needs open, self-healing systems that can withstand threats. The fastest way to build such resiliency is to expose the system to those threats so that it generates self-correcting counter-responses. Bitcoin, unprotected by a corporate IT team's firewalls, rises to that challenge.  About here you might assume I'm going to smugly argue that the latest round of crypto critics are doomed to the same fate as past naysayers, who were proven wrong by the price recoveries that occurred after prior moments of ""crisis."" (These newcomers would include former Paypal CEO Bill Harris, who told CNBC this month that he saw bitcoin going to zero.)  But that's not what this column is about.  History is not prologue. The fact that bitcoin eventually recovered from the low of $210 it hit one year after its late-2013 peak of $1,150 is no guarantee that it will rebound from its current price near $6,500 and revisit its late-2017 peak of $19,783. And, yes, it could definitely go lower.  Fewer Lambos, more education  Rather, what I'd like to talk about is how the crypto community should use this moment to forget about price fluctuations and instead engage the world in a proper discussion about blockchain technology's potential.  Let's have less ""to the moon"" and ""Lambo"" talk and more discussions about the promise of peer-to-peer exchange, smart contracts and decentralized applications.  It's time to ask questions about what we want this movement to be when it grows up. What do we want cryptocurrency and blockchain technology to achieve? And embedded in that is a question about who we are. As it stands in 2018, what does the crypto and blockchain community represent?  Some serious crypto developers might submit that bothering oneself with such flimsy questions of identity is no better than obsessing with price levels, when the most important thing they need to do is write code and develop real, battle-tested functionality.  To be sure, a post-bubble period, when the speculators' distracting hype has dissipated, is a great time for developers to get work done. It's no coincidence that Segregated Witness (Segwit) and the Lightning Network were developed during the prior bitcoin price lull. The ERC-20 ethereum token standard was also forged in that period, paving the way for ICO boom of 2016-2017.  But the involvement of others in the advance of this technology must also be acknowledged – even those from the enterprise world, the corporate community that hardcore crypto folks tend to dismiss. The blockchain community's identity is complex and multi-faceted.  Learning from private blockchains  During the previous bitcoin market hiatus, while bitcoin developers worked on scaling solutions amid a different kind of ""crisis"" – the block size debate – a wave of non-developer newcomers started getting interested in blockchain technology: lawyers, bankers, supply-chain managers and regulators.  Rising to serve their interests were a variety of permissioned blockchain platforms, including IBM's Fabric, introduced within the Hyperledger project, and the R3 consortium's Corda.  Fast-forward to 2018 and, while cryptocurrency investors lick their wounds and wonder what the future holds, permissioned enterprise solutions are marching ahead, moving from proofs-of-concept to real-world implementations.  In just two recent examples, the World Bank teamed up with Microsoft and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia to issue its first blockchain-based bond and Maersk and IBM announced that 94 firms have signed up for TradeLens, their supply chain, shipping and logistics platform.  Many crypto developers dismiss these enterprise-driven private blockchain solutions, which typically employ pre-bitcoin consensus solutions such as practical byzantine fault tolerance and a trusted entity to administer the network, as a retrograde solution that's not censorship-resistant. Like them, I believe permissioned blockchains will ultimately be proven inferior to permissionless systems, much as the open internet's greater access to innovation and bigger network defeated private companies' walled-garden ""intranets"" in the 1990s.  But I also think the work being done on these permissioned blockchain solutions is immensely valuable.  Until scaling solutions such as Lightning and sharding are working at full capability, permissionless blockchains can't introduce decentralized applications at scale with anywhere near the ease of permissioned systems, which have fewer governance and computational limitations. In the meantime, there's a great deal of learning that we can – indeed, need – to take from how these real-world private blockchain implementations play out.  Consider what the TradeLens project might tell us. What standards and practices will shippers, manufacturing companies and customs agents adopt as they integrate smart contracts to coordinate the movement of goods across multiple jurisdictions?  Finding common ground  This cross-community learning is precisely why the ""who are we?"" question matters.  Believe it or not, across a diverse and even divisive community – public versus private blockchains, BTC versus BCH, maximalists versus everyone else – a common vision does exist. We just need to define that shared identity more constructively than the one that many outside of the community assign to it: that of a nerdy, fanatic cult.  (An aside: one response to Bill Harris's derisive comment about the ""cult of bitcoin's"" false claims – ""that it's instant, free, scalable, efficient, secure, globally accepted and useful"" – is to point out that in post-AD Rome, Christianity was a cult. Also, why do people who made their living from the constant improvement of the internet assume that crypto technology is doomed to a static existence? Dismissing bitcoin because of its limited scalability and adoption in 2018 is like attacking the Internet in 1995 because 28 bps modems were too slow to enable meaningful connectivity – as if no engineers see the problem or are working on it. Sheesh.)  How do we get society to go beyond these simplistic representations of the blockchain community? What is the core commonality that matters within this wide tent?  To me it is the common recognition that decentralized consensus mechanisms that enable groups of people to collectively assess the veracity of shared information can help society more efficiently overcome the cost of trust, an age-old human problem. They all see in this new model big opportunities to disintermediate value exchanges of all kinds and, in doing so, to open markets and unlock innovations that produce better outcomes for everyone.  Blockchains are a complex, multifaceted social technology. As such, achieving its full potential requires different types of expertise. Of course, we need a great deal of protocol development, but also UX and application design. And beyond the engineering realm, we need legal reforms, governance solutions, standards agreements, and marketing and education.  Here the 2014-2015 price lull is also instructive. At that time, bankers and lawyers, their interest piqued by the market mania they'd witnessed in 2013, took early moves toward comprehending blockchain technology. In doing so, they spurred a valuable societal debate on the challenges and opportunities it presents.  Even as a few ham-fisted regulatory solutions, such as the BitLicense, emerged and as banks undertook a clumsy, misguided attempt to co-opt ""blockchain without bitcoin,"" the opening of a mainstream conversation enabled sensible advocates for the technology such as Coin Center and the Chamber of Digital Commerce to establish an invaluable dialogue with policymakers and society at large.  I see potential to do even more at this time, as securities regulators grapple with how to define and manage token markets and as wide-membership industry initiatives such as the Token Alliance come up with useful frameworks for self-regulation.  A time like now, with the bubble burst and the market mania subsiding, is the ideal one in which to undertake this kind of multi-stakeholder engagement.

42381105,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93v5l,1534741205,Police Arrest Hackers Suspected of Stealing $87 Million in Crypto,"Chinese police from multiple cities have arrested three individuals who allegedly stole bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies worth around $87 million.  Chinese news agency Xinhua reported on Saturday that the three were busted on Aug. 15 in the provinces of Hunan and Changchun and the country's capital Beijing after a months-long investigation launched by the police.  According to the report, a self-declared victim, identified by the surname Zhang, first filed a complaint to the police in the northwestern city of Xi'an in March, alleging his computer had been hacked and crypto assets worth around $14.5 million stolen.  The police investigation, which received assistance from several unnamed internet companies, later located a suspect with the surname Zhou, who they claimed had made a remote attack to transfer the funds from Zhang's computer.  As the investigation continued, the police further identified two alleged accomplices of Zhou that they said were highly experienced hackers.  The group was further accused of having conducted a series of illegal cyber intrusions into corporate and personal networks to obtain crypto assets initially estimated to amount to 600 million yuan, or about $87 million.  The arrests come at a time when Chinese police are stepping up efforts to crack down on cybercrimes relating to cryptocurrency.  Just a month ago, police in China's Dalian city also arrested 20 suspects from an IT firm who allegedly used crypto mining malware to infect over a million computers and reportedly earned more than $2 million over two years.

42381118,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93vKr,1534734320,What It's Like to Be a Woman In China's Get-Rich-Quick Crypto Culture,"Sa Wang has co-founded several successful companies in the tech and blockchain space, first at popular Chinese self-service kiosk startup Dora, and now at top 50 crypto project and blockchain protocol IOST.      We hear a lot about women (or the lack thereof) in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space.  Confirming what many of us already suspected, CoinDesk's Q2 2018 State of the Blockchain Report found that only 4 percent of crypto investors are women. In tandem, reporters regularly call the ""blockchain bros"" on the carpet for elbowing women out of yet another lucrative emerging industry.  But this has been a predominantly West-centric conversation, casting the spotlight on gender inequality and underrepresentation at Western crypto companies, Western blockchain conferences, and Western meetups.  Thus far, news articles, Twitter threads, and Medium posts have largely neglected the diversity of female experiences in other parts of the world, such as China, South Korea and Japan, where the crypto space is equally — if not more — dynamic and growing.  Take China, for instance. Despite banning ICOs and bringing bitcoin trading to a virtual standstill, in 2017, China was responsible for over half of the world's blockchain-related patent applications — with the U.S. coming in a distant second. The top three cryptocurrencies by market cap launched in 2018 — Zilliqa, Ontology, and IOST — are all Chinese.  With such a strong Asian presence in the blockchain world, why do we rarely hear about Asian women in crypto? What can the rest of the world learn from our experiences?  Chinese women in crypto  In order to understand what it's like to be a Chinese woman in crypto, first you must understand the Chinese crypto space itself.  Despite China's ban on crypto trading, there is a ravenous appetite for crypto wealth — traders have simply started placing their bets in Japan, Hong Kong, and South Korea. The regulatory crackdowns have done little to stifle the hundreds of scam crypto projects in China (many of them deployed overseas), while newly minted bitcoin millionaires — mostly male with no education or merits necessary — abound.  In contrast to the West, where conversations are slowly evolving towards a more nuanced discussion of the merits of blockchain technology and institutional adoption, Chinese crypto enthusiasts largely maintain a single-minded speculative focus: Will this coin be listed on a Korean exchange soon? What is its market cap? Should I buy? Should I sell?  This get-rich-quick mentality makes it very difficult for serious blockchain advocates — especially females, who already have to fight for a voice — to cut through the noise and evangelize a longer-term (and much less sexy) message.  As Carylyne Chan of CoinMarketCap writes in her fascinating and detailed account of Chinese crypto culture:  ""Scam cases… have engendered many tragedies, and created a more insidious impact: For those who truly believe in the blockchain, such scams are smearing the blockchain technology name, making it notorious while the underlying premise is laudable.""  The challenges Chinese women in crypto face are similar to those anywhere else in the world, but they're compounded by the chaos and ""scammy""-ness of the space.  Attend any Chinese blockchain meetup, and you'll come across perhaps eight women for every 100 attendees. If you happen to be one of those eight women, you can expect to be invited on a date (or multiple dates) to some crypto millionaire's yacht after the meetup ends. You certainly shouldn't expect to be taken seriously — especially if your interests lie in blockchain technology, rather than crypto speculation.  WeChat: Bane or boon?  But Chinese crypto puts a much larger emphasis on community than the U.S. — it's everything, and it can go a long way towards empowering women.  Since Twitter and YouTube are banned in China, WeChat (China's answer to WhatsApp) is our community hub of choice. Any given blockchain project can have 50 or more WeChat groups dedicated to it, each boasting 300 to 500 members who share and discuss every company announcement.  One of those WeChat groups is called Blockchain Ladies. This community plays a crucial role in empowering and connecting Chinese women in crypto — but it also throws into stark relief the distance we need to traverse before the space is anywhere close to being equalized.  In addition to discussing the latest blockchain and crypto topics, every two weeks, the women of Blockchain Ladies invite a powerful or famous male in the crypto space for an ""ask me anything"" (AMA) session.  These AMA's cover a wide range of topics from technology to community building to philosophy, but they always end with the same question:  ""If you were single, what kind of woman would you be attracted to?""  While certainly progress has been made, clearly we still have a long way to go.  Words of advice  If my experience as a Chinese woman in crypto has taught me anything, it's that we need to be twice as strong and grounded if we want to compete with our male counterparts. The unfortunate reality is that women have to work harder, project confidence even if we're lacking it, find the right allies and work on projects where our male counterparts understand our value.  No matter the country, being a woman in the crypto space requires some serious soul-searching. Do your research. Know why you're entering the industry and what you have to bring to the table. Don't become a tool or sacrifice your integrity to get ahead. Surround yourself with both male and female advocates who trust you, are familiar with your work, and will empower you to achieve your goals.  Educate yourself. Many of the (predominantly male) crypto millionaires around you actually know very little beyond the ins and outs of crypto trading, so aspire to outshine them in everything else. Share your knowledge with other women in the space; for example, I host internal tech training sessions at IOST for our non-technical female employees so they can talk about it in an educated way.  You have probably heard this before, but don't focus on your femaleness.  It will only discourage you, because the statistics are against you. Set your own goals and establish an intrinsic, guiding mission to get you through the crazy ride upon which you are about to embark. If you're in it for the money, don't bother — tens of thousands of people are doing the same thing. Besides, the real value of blockchain technology can't be measured in dollar or yuan signs.  I joined this space enamored with the idea of decentralization. My personal mission is to communicate why blockchain is important and how it can be used in the real world, because I believe it can change the world. This will be a long education process that may take years, but in a space filled with scams and transient projects, I feel at peace knowing that I plan to be here long after the noise has died down and the ""get rich quick"" types have had their fill.  They can have their fun building mounds of cash, but I'm building the future.

42381117,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93vNN,1534730455,UPS Eyes Blockchain in Bid to Track Global Shipping Data,"Shipping giant UPS has filed for a new patent that uses blockchain as part of a distributed system for sending packages worldwide.  The patent application, published on Aug. 16 by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), further reveals the company's interest in using blockchain to re-envision how shipments move around the world.  Entitled ""Autonomous services selection system and distributed transportation database(s),"" the concept involves storing numerous types of data within a distributed ledger network, including information about a package's destination, its movement and transportation plans for shipment units.  As CoinDesk previously reported, UPS joined a transportation-focused blockchain consortium in 2017 and has even hinted at the idea of accepting bitcoin through a proposed system of item-exchange lockers.  Notably, UPS suggests using more than one distributed ledger in an effort to track a range of shipment orders, ""each providing varying information/data regarding respective asset types (e.g., shipment units and/or associated shipment units).""  ""Thus, certain embodiments enable tracking of a first set of shipment units and a second set of shipment units associated with the first set of shipment units separately, thereby enabling the use of various smart contracts relating to shipping services and shipment unit handling in a bifurcated manner,"" the company wrote.  That the company would look at different ways to enhance the process through which it moves shipments around the world is perhaps unsurprising, given its scale. UPS shipped more than 5 billion packages and documents last year, according to its website, earning $54 billion in revenue.
