42400407,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJWEm,1505421913,$90 Million Budget: Japan's GMO Reveals More Cryptocurrency Mining Details,"Japanese digital services firm GMO has divulged additional plans for its forthcoming cryptocurrency mine and the $90 million budget backing it.  According to TechWave, on Wednesday the company held a presentation on the plan following its announcement last week. GMO, which was founded in the 1990s and already operates its own cryptocurrency exchange, said it would begin mining – an energy intensive process by which new transactions are added to a blockchain –in the first half of 2018.  In the presentation, GMO representatives said that it would begin testing a new 7nm semiconductor chip by the spring. To date, according to the demo, GMO has already spent $3 million out of an expected 10 billion yen (worth approximately $90 million). That initial funding has been spent to kickstart the chip development as well as work on the facility itself, according to the report.  GMO representatives announced the datacenter, which will be built in northern Europe, and its purpose last week, marking the first time a major internet company jumped into the cryptocurrency mining market.  According to GMO President Masatoshi Kumagai:  ""Besides mining at our company, we also plan to sell the mining board with the 'cloud mining center' [so] that anyone can participate in mining.""  GMO is not the only company to get involved in cryptocurrency mining. Japanese e-commerce giant DMM announced they would also be getting involved with the business. They plan to begin testing in October, and may enter full production by the end of 2017.  Editor's Note: Statements in this article were translated from Japanese.

42400403,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJW7t,1505418330,BoE Official: Central Bank Digital Currency Would Need 'Extraordinary' Resilience,"A researcher at the Bank of England explored some of the design requirements for a central bank-issued digital currency earlier this week – regardless of whether it utilizes blockchain to operate.  Writing on the Bank Underground blog, Simon Scorer, who serves a manager for UK central bank's digital currencies research team, set aside some of the legal and economic considerations involved (which have been raised by others at the Bank of England). Rather, he focused on the technology aspects, as well as the demands such a system would create.  As he wrote:  ""Like current financial infrastructure, a widely used [central bank digital currency] would likely be considered critical national infrastructure.…It would need to be operational across the country, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. This would require extraordinary levels of resilience.""  Notably, Scorer's blog dives into the design requirements regardless of whether a blockchain ends up being used. Indeed, he proposed looking at both distributed ledger-based systems as well as those that use different kinds of tech.  According to Scorer, a central bank digital currency needs to be resilient against a range of problems and capable of running continuously.  ""A minimum operational availability of 99.999% might not be unreasonable for the core settlement engine – equating to a downtime of approximately 5 minutes during a year,"" he wrote.  Besides resilience, this new system would need to be protected from cyberattacks, robust enough to handle large volumes of transactions, able to process these transactions immediately – or as close to immediately as possible – and have adequate privacy protections.  The UK central bank has been examining potential uses of the tech, including for the use of an institutionally backed digital currency, since as early as 2015. In September of that year, the Bank of England's chief economist said that blockchain could be used to underpin such a system.  Among the notable developments since that time was a possible plan to use blockchain within the central bank's next-generation real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system. Ultimately, it opted to make that system compatible with distributed ledger tech rather than using it as its foundation.

The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) has hit a fresh low of $3,350.17 – roughly $523 down from the day's open of $3,874.26. When accounting for the day's price high of $3,923.98, that figure swells to approximately $573.  At press time, the price is at $3,363.25, according to the BPI.  Shanghai-based BTCC announced that it would would cease offering trading services on September 30, citing statements issued earlier this month by the People's Bank of China and other regulatory bodies in the country. BTCC's move came just a day after China-based BitKan announced that it would halt its over-the-counter (OTC) trading offering.  The new move downward comes hours after bitcoin's price fell below $3,500, falling below the 50-day moving average for the first time since July 20.  Many other cryptocurrency markets are experiencing sharp declines today, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Of the top-10 cryptocurrencies, litecoin has seen the heaviest decline, falling in the last 24 hours by more than 24% at time of writing with much of the volume being seen in Chinese exchange OKCoin and Huobi.  The collective cryptocurrency market capitalization has fallen below $120 billion for the first time in a month, per CoinMarketCap, hitting roughly $114.4 billion at press time.

42400411,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJWHj,1505402159,Thai Securities Regulators Seek 'Appropriate' Rules for ICOs,"Securities regulators in Thailand have issued a new statement on initial coin offerings (ICOs), advising that some token tales may fall under the country's definition of a securities offering.  The Securities and Exchange Commission, Thailand (SEC Thailand) said today that that ""some (ICOs) may resemble financial returns, rights and obligation,"" thus triggering the relevant regulations. It also expressed concern that, in some cases, token sales may be used to facilitate fraud against unwitting investors.  At the same time, SEC Thailand hinted at a more accommodative stance compared to other jurisdictions – mostly notably China, which issued a ban on the funding model earlier this month.  The agency said:  ""The SEC Thailand encourages access to funding for businesses, including high potential tech startups, and realizes the potential of ICO in answering startups' funding needs. In cases where an ICO constitutes offering of securities, the issuer will need to comply with applicable regulatory requirements under the SEC Thailand's purview.""  Notably – perhaps echoing statements that came from Canada's securities regulators last month – SEC Thailand suggested that it may carve out policy accommodations for some token sales, though it is too early in that process to tell what approach the agency might ultimately take.  ""...to strike the balance between supporting digital innovation and protecting investors from potential ICO scams, the SEC Thailand is considering appropriate approaches on ICO and welcomes comments and suggestions from the private sector,"" the statement read.  The past weeks have seen a spate of similar announcements from securities regulators around the world, including Canada, Singapore and the US, among others.

As such, the announcement is the latest that supports the rumor regulators are preparing a formal ban on domestic bitcoin exchanges. Long liquidations in BTC markets have gathered pace amid fears that a confirmation from the People's Bank of China will follow over the next few days.  According to data from CoinMarketCap, bitcoin's price has shed 11 percent over the last 24 hours. The drop seen today has taken the week-on-week losses to 24 percent. Month-on-month, the cryptocurrency is down 19 percent.  Though driven lower by the bearish news flow, the sell-off should not come as a surprise as price action analysis favors the downside toward $3,000.  Let's have a look at new developments on the technical charts that corroborate the bearish view presented 24 hours ago.  Daily chart  Weekly chart  View  Bitcoin has already retracted close to 50 percent of the July–September rally. With the 1-hour and 4-hour RSI hovering in the oversold territory, the dips below the upward sloping 10-week SMA could be short lived.  A move higher to $3,750-3,800 cannot be ruled out before another round of sell-off unfolds.  In the long-term, BTC looks set to test $3,000 levels.

42400401,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJW8s,1505393105,"Old Flames, New Code: Ripple and Hyperledger Reunite for Interledger Effort","Ripple and Hyperledger might soon get a chance to reignite an old flame.  Following an early promise by Ripple to contribute code to the Hyperledger blockchain consortium's open-source repository, the two organizations parted ways over differing opinions on blockchain design. Whereas Hyperledger's members largely focused on private blockchains that required permission to join, Ripple instead created hybrid technology featuring a cryptocurrency more reminiscent of a public blockchain.  But now, the star-crossed companies have found an unusual Cupid who may have what it takes to finally bring them together: NTT Data, a Japanese system integration company.  The story begins with NTT Data (through its subsidiary Everis) working on a new version of Ripple's open-source Interledger protocol beginning in July 2016. The plan was to reimplement Interledger using the Java computing language, since Interledger is currently only available in JavaScript.  When Ripple learned of NTT Data's efforts to rebuild the platform, the company was not only intrigued, it wanted to help.  Together, the companies have submitted the results of that collaboration to Hyperledger, of which NTT Data is a founding member. If admitted, the new Interledger implementation could mean not just a new language for developers to build with, but a bridge to connect all of Hyperledger's open-source codebases, including Fabric, Sawtooth and Burrow.  In an exclusive interview with CoinDesk, Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas expressed enthusiasm about the effort, yet also relayed that there are final obstacles to be overcome to finally make things official with Hyperledger.  Thomas said:  ""We are supporting that effort, but there's still a lot of decisions to be made.""  Marrying blockchains  Described in a November 2015 white paper as a bridge between traditional banking ledgers, public blockchains and private blockchains, Interledger has evolved into a product capable of conducting a single transaction across as many as seven different ledgers.  And with that, NTT Data increasingly saw it as a way to connect its clients to a diverse set of the ""world's existing payment networks,"" according to Everis blockchain program manager Isaac Arruebarrena.  In interview with CoinDesk, Arruebarrena explained how NTT Data, which last year conducted $15.7 billion (17 trillion Japanese yen) in sales, grew from being a founding member of Hyperledger in 2015, to identifying Interledger as ""one of the cornerstones"" of its corporate strategy.  ""Our main goal is to become the best technology partner for the companies we work with,"" said Arruebarrena, adding that, while there is a complicated history between Interledger and Hyperledger, he's dedicated to bringing the two together.  He said:  ""We are determined to contribute to the evolution of the Interledger protocol in order to enable interoperability between distributed ledger platforms and financial institutions' existing ledgers.""  The fun begins  However, several steps must be accomplished before NTT Data moves Ripple's proposal into Hyperledger, according to the project's executive director, Brian Behlendorf.  First is the formal selection of a name, which is currently the unwieldy ""Hyperledger Interledger-Java,"" taken from the platform's key distinguishing trait.  But Hyperledger members are currently discussing how to make the platform's name more accessible, and possibly more easily trademarked. Alternatives include Hyperledger Connect, Hyperledger Liquid, Hyperledger QuILt (IL standing for Interledger) and Hyperledger Jill (a portmanteau of Java and Interledger).  Outside the collaborative naming process, the technical steering committee is now evaluating the code and could accept or reject it as soon as next week, but likely no later than ""another few weeks,"" said Behlendorf.  Once the code is approved, he said, the collaboration will begin the onboarding process as an incubating project, adding, ""and then the fun begins.""  Behlendorf concluded:  ""As Interledger appears to be a compelling way to build bridges across chains to transfer messages and assets, it's something I personally really hope to see accepted into Hyperledger.""

42427771,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3d7h,1505391864,Ethereum Drops Below $250 as Price Hits Inflection Point,"The ether-US dollar exchange rate fell to a six-week low below $250 today as the mood in the markets soured and fears of a broader exchange crackdown in China were seemingly confirmed.  However, while today's price decline appears to be a response to the news, ether's particular drop should not be a surprise for traders – the move was in line with the bearish technicals discussed earlier this week. As we've covered previously, China's decision to ban ICOs hurt ether the most as the vast majority of ICOs are launching tokens issued on top of the ethereum blockchain.  When the news hit the wires last Friday, it lead to a bout of panic selling in cryptocurrencies. However, as the rumors went unconfirmed, ether prices moved higher to $316 levels on the back of short covering.  The lack of fresh buying interest then made way for a deeper correction to $256 levels.  All in all, however, it's perhaps best to view this as nothing more than a healthy technical correction following a rally of epic proportions. In one year, the value of all blockchain-based cryptocurrencies has increased by a whopping 1,450 percent.  Ether clocked record highs above $400 this summer, and at press time, it's still trading at $266 levels, which means only 50 percent of the rally from the July low of $136 has been undone. Week-on-week, ether is down 20.6%. On a monthly basis, the cryptocurrency is down 11%.  Last but not the least, the technical factors are responsible for the sell-off as well.  The ongoing technical correction would add credence to the stellar rally in ether and other cryptocurrencies. In a way, the correction is a litmus test as traders who missed the bus earlier can enter the market now.  Increased dip demand would signal that heightened interest in cryptocurrencies is for real.  Is the technical correction over?  Daily chart  The first sign that the technical correction has ended would be a break above the descending trend line (dotted green line). A more reliable signal would be a break above $316.73 (September 12 high) as it would mark the violation of the falling tops or lower highs pattern.  Of late volumes have surged on negative days (on September 4 and September 8). Sharp rise in volumes on positive days would increase the odds of trend reversal.  Ether at inflection point  4-hour chart  The chart above shows head and shoulders pattern. Prices currently trade below the neckline support of $266.  The ""head and shoulders"" is a reversal pattern that, when formed, signals an asset (in this case ether) is likely to move against the previous trend. The H&S neckline (line drawn from the left shoulder bottom and right shoulder bottom) support has been breached.  An end of the day close below $266 would confirm bullish-to-bearish trend reversal and could open doors for a much deeper sell-off to $177 (July 29 low).  As per the measured height method (difference between head and shoulder peak ($395) and neckline support ($266) is subtracted from the neckline support), ether could drop to $137 on confirmation of the head and shoulders breakdown.  Interestingly, the target as per the measured height method almost coincides with the July low of $136. However, sell-off of such epic proportions appears unlikely as of now.

In statements on Twitter and on China-language social media, the oldest cryptocurrency exchange platform in the world's largest market said it would immediately stop onboarding new users, but that its mining pools and international exchange would continue to operate normally.  At press time, the statement is the latest to seemingly confirm China may be on the verge of a broader effort to curb domestic cryptocurrency activity, following yet another report by a local financial news source indicating that regulators are preparing a formal ban on domestic bitcoin exchanges.  According to an exclusive report by Shanghai-based business mediaYicai, Shanghai's Municipal Financial Service Office has issued a verbal order to bitcoin exchange startups, indicating that they should cease operations.  The source reportedly said that the exchanges will shut down at the end of September.  It is currently unclear whether that ban will extend to other forms of trading, such as peer-to-peer trading, or more experimental decentralized blockchain-based exchanges. However, at least one over-the-counter trading service has ceased operations, reportedly due to increasing scrutiny from lawmakers.  At press time, other domestic exchanges are complicating the narrative, with BTCC rival Huobi telling CoinDesk it has not ""received clear document or notice"" of exchange ban, but that it will follow any formal guidance.  Elsewhere, other organizations that lack regulatory power are weighing in on the situation, as today's news follows a statement issued by the Chinese National Internet Finance Association (NIFA)yesterday that questioned the legal basis for cryptocurrencies. The self-regulatory group, formed by the Chinese government, boasts participation from some of the country's largest online financial firms.  But while claims are mounting, it's important to note that no official announcement has yet been made by the People's Bank of China or the country's government regarding the ban.  As such, it remains to be seen what steps, if any, will be taken that impact China's cryptocurrency market.

Aimed to allow developers to familiarize themselves with the payment channel tech and its API prior to the official release, as well as feedback on potential issues, the preview isn't yet safe to use on the main ethereum blockchain as it still requires a security audit.  The Raiden team stated in an announcement:  ""We hope that developers will check out the release, start prototyping [decentralized applications] and find and report bugs which will help us improve Raiden on our way towards a [minimum viable product] release.""  Announced in 2015, Raiden is one of ethereum's answers to scaling, as it seeks to shift the majority of transactions off the main ethereum blockchain and thereby massively increase transaction speeds – potentially enabling millions of transactions per second.  Raiden also accommodates token exchange – meaning users don't need to use a centralized platform to trade – and features an API that can facilitate interactions with decentralized applications, or dapps.  All in all, with a test network for Raiden deployed by developers last week, the solution appears to be making strides toward production.  When that might be is still unclear, however. Raiden addressed the reasons for the uncertain timeframe in the announcement, saying, ""payment channel network technology is even harder than anticipated, involving a complexity that goes beyond most common software development challenges.""  To illustrate the project's advancement, its developers recently released an animated visual of its commits to GitHub (having made over 2,000 in the last six months).

42427767,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3d3h,1505383230,Coinbase Vets Talk New Fund: Want Returns? Think Beyond Bitcoin,"""People have this perception that bitcoin and ethereum are completely anonymous when that is not the case.""  That's one of the insights Linda Xie gleaned over three years working at Coinbase – understandings that are now guiding strategy at the as-yet-unnamed cryptocurrency hedge fund she's leaving to start.  One of a growing number of vehicles seeking to help investors capture the market's meteoric growth, Xie's is perhaps distinguished by her resume.  Most recently a product manager at Coinbase, Xie left her position last week to join up with another company veteran, software developer Jordan Clifford, on the venture. Their move is notable following the departures of Nick Tomaino and Olaf Carlson-Wee, both of whom also left Coinbase to found investment vehicles.  But Xie wants her fund to be known by the strength of its bets, and she says she's gambling on the idea that gains will be found in the growing market of cryptocurrencies beyond bitcoin. In particular, she described privacy-focused cryptocurrencies as ""extremely undervalued"" given their potential to help solve what she perceives as limitations of the bitcoin protocol.  In her first public interview about her fund's strategy, she told CoinDesk:  ""You can actually reveal information on the blockchain. … This isn't well known right now. Even people that I talk to inside the space are kind of surprised that it's so easy to actually trace.""  Not simply an academic observation, Xie learned this firsthand at Coinbase, working in the San Francisco startup's compliance investigations department.  While helping law enforcement catch cybercriminals by tracing transactions through the public ledger, she realized that same transparency could eventually aid phishing attackers and scammers, who may use the blockchain to identify potential victims with large holdings.  Buy and hold  It's this real-life experience that is leading Xie's fund to focus on privacy-focused cryptos such as zcash, dash and monero.  Broadly, however, the fund will follow a long-term, buy-and-hold strategy, reflecting another insight she said was gained at Coinbase: ""Don't try to trade on the news.""  In this way, investments will be primarily in large-cap cryptocurrencies, coins with smaller market capitalizations and token pre-sales, she said.  Bitcoin and ether will be the base of the new fund's large-cap investments. Bitcoin is regarded in the crypto market as a store of value, according to Xie, so the fund wants to maintain continued exposure, while ethereum, she reasons, is likely to maintain value as a key platform for the development of decentralized applications.  Despite her enthusiasm for bitcoin and ether, though, Xie sees big potential in certain smaller market cap coins.  ""It's important to diversify your portfolio in this space because I don't think there's ultimately going to be only one winner,"" she said, pointing to the iterative nature of technical development.  Governance and scaling  In addition to privacy holes, Xie sees governance issues and scaling problems as risks that some investors aren't fully thinking through before buying.  If you're going to buy something and hold it for the long term, she said, you're going to need to ask yourself: Will this really scale? Novice investors, she said, often don't realize that a coin that may be ""fine for now"" could become a victim of its own success as more people join the network.  As Xie put it:  ""If there is one killer app built on top of this, will anyone actually be able to use it?""  A closely related issue is governance. Xie contended that one major red flag from a governance perspective is the concentration of coins among a few holders.  ""If they're going to be doing a decentralized governance system, the project founders or the coin creators themselves shouldn't have a majority of these coins,"" she said.  The flip side of risk is opportunity, and Xie is especially excited about coins where she considers the creators make shrewd decisions about governance.  Some recent examples of coins that did governance correctly from the start, in her view, are Tezos and 0x. These coins, she explained, are widely held, and allow their users to vote on protocol upgrades to mitigate scaling problems.  Token pre-sales  Only about 20 percent of the new fund's portfolio will be dedicated to token pre-sales, the earliest stage of investment in initial coin offerings, the process by which entrepreneurs mint new cryptocurrencies to fund startup development.  That's not to say Xie doesn't want to invest in more pre-sales, but she also has concerns.  ""This is the stuff that actually really excites me. This is more of the VC-type investing – but I just don't think there are enough projects,"" she said.  In fact, there are only a ""handful of projects"" that have conducted ICOs where she sees a real need to issue a token. The key question, according to Xie, is: ""If I were to take this project and replace the token with ether, would it still operate the same way?""  If the answer is yes, the token may not be a good, long-term buy-and-hold opportunity.  Further, the current popularity of token sales is distorting markets. ""People are seeing that there's a lot of easy fundraising in the space and they are taking advantage of it,"" Xie said.  New investors, especially, should be concerned about this risk.  Pitfalls and best practices  One more potential pitfall for investors is technological risk.  To address that risk, Xie said, the ability to conduct code analysis prior to investing is critical for institutional funds. While her background is mostly financial – ­­she worked in portfolio risk management before joining Coinbase – Xie knows how to code.  Still, that wasn't enough. ""I wouldn't have started this fund without a technical co-founder. That's the hard requirement for me,"" she said.  And that's where co-founder Jordan Clifford, who worked as a software engineer at Coinbase for nearly two years, comes in.  The importance of technical skills, according to Xie, became obvious last week when a critical security flaw was discovered in IOTA — and several hundred million dollars evaporated from its market cap.  As a final word of advice, she suggested that, if you're a newcomer to crypto and you're fortunate enough to realize gains, you should sell off the amount of your initial investment.  If you're lucky enough to be able to do that, she said:  ""Everything you're holding onto is gains ... and that helps people have more peace of mind.""

42427760,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3cph,1505379606,Namibian Central Bank: Bitcoin Purchases Illegal Under Law,"Cryptocurrency exchanges are not allowed in Namibia under a decades-old law, and merchants in the African country may not accept them as payment for goods and services, the nation's central bank has said.  In a new nine-page position paper,https://www.bon.com.na/CMSTemplates/Bon/Files/bon.com.na/f9/f94d2a6a-dd7c-4080-9ffe-8e77b5e85909.pdf the Bank of Namibia said bitcoin and its progeny pose only a ""minimal"" threat to the central bank's monetary policymaking role.  It also made familiar points about the risks of money laundering from cryptocurrencies, the alleged shortcomings of a currency without government or commodity backing, and the potential benefits the financial system could achieve through its underlying distributed ledger technology.  The paper heavily cites previous research by the International Monetary Fund and the Financial Action Task Force, a global intergovernmental anti-money-laundering organization. In other statements, it further elaborated on its interpretation of relevant domestic law.  For example, Namibia's Exchange Control Act of 1966 ""does not make provision for the establishment of virtual currency exchanges or bureaus in Namibia,"" the central bank said.  The paper continued:  ""In addition to the bank not recognizing virtual currencies as legal tender in Namibia, it also does not recognize it to be a foreign currency that can be exchanged for local currency. This is because virtual currencies are neither issued nor guaranteed by a central bank nor backed by any commodity.""  While the report acknowledges that cryptocurrencies can be used to facilitate remittances and other consumer payments, by trading into and out of fiat currencies, it said that ""due to the lack of a legal premise, the bank is unable to endorse such activities in Namibia at the moment.""  Even exchanging bitcoin for a cup of coffee is forbidden, apparently.  ""Virtual currencies cannot be used to pay for goods and services in Namibia,"" the central bank said. ""For example, a local shop is not allowed to price or accept virtual currencies in exchange for goods and services. Users of virtual currencies should therefore exercise caution when dealing in this type of currencies or when comparing it to e-money,"" meaning fiat currency in digital form.

42427761,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3cnh,1505376013,Crypto Is Here to Stay (Whatever Jamie Dimon Might Say),"Bradley Tusk is the founder and CEO of Tusk Ventures , a venture capital firm that works with and invests in high-growth startups facing political and regulatory challenges.  In this opinion piece, Tusk discusses what he feels is the hypocrisy in recent statements from JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon on bitcoin.      Jamie Dimon made news again on Tuesday when he savaged bitcoin specifically and cryptocurrency generally, calling it a fad even worse than the tulip craze, and promising to fire any JPMorgan trader who dealt in bitcoin.  But that couldn't be farther from the case. Rather, Dimon's comments encapsulate an outdated mentality whose very existence explains why there's a demand and need for cryptocurrency in the first place.  In the U.S. alone, trust in major institutions (like Dimon's) has plummeted. People distrust government: Congress enjoys a roughly 10 percent approval rating and the president's is already below 40 percent People distrust organized religion just as much: the scandals plaguing the Catholic Church over the last two decades have helped decimate public trust in the moral authority of religious institutions across the board (even with a popular Pope now in place).  At least a third of the country (Trump's hardcore supporters) distrust the mainstream media, if not more. Faith in Wall Street never recovered after the financial crisis (financial institutions across the country faced significant fines and sanctions for their reprehensible actions).  Between the controversies over safe spaces, guest speakers, commencement addresses and free speech, our universities lack anything resembling a clear moral compass.  And compared to the rest of the world, the U.S. is doing pretty well.  Much of Latin America – Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina – is in political shambles. The Middle East is even worse. The EU is still on shaky ground. Russia? North Korea? If you don't have faith in your government, your religious leaders, the media, the banks, financial leaders, and academic leaders, then you want – actually, you need – an alternative.  That's why so many people are desperately seeking both a safe haven from the volatility of their own currency and homeland, and for a way to connect with others who think like they do – whether they share a common passport or not.  Will bitcoin itself definitely succeed? It may not. Any given currency or exchange certainly could fail and prove Dimon right in the short term.  But will cryptocurrency go away? No. This is not a monetary version of Esperanto. Faith and trust, like anything else, needs somewhere to go during a vacuum.  If you don’t feel comfortable that Jamie Dimon is looking out for the general public (and the $20-plus billion JPMorgan has paid in fines for ethical lapses over the past few years makes it hard to argue otherwise), if you don't really trust your senator or president to put your interests first, if you think the people who used to claim moral authority now lack it, you need someplace to go. That's true intellectually and it's true economically.  Smart leaders in finance will see the potential and demand for crypto, embrace it and make sure their institutions and shareholders can both participate and benefit. People either afraid of change or unable to recognize it will scoff. The best case outcome for them is they've retired before they're ultimately proven wrong.  Either way, Dimon's comments only underscore why crypto is necessary and why it isn't going anywhere – whether he likes it or not.
