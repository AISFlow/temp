42399826,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyolI,1493762149,"5 Fast Facts on Ether, The Ethereum Token That's Up 900% This Year","Bitcoin isn't the only cryptocurrency that's trading at all-time highs.  Lost a bit in the mainstream spotlight has been ether, the cryptographic token that powers of the ethereum blockchain. But, when compared to bitcoin's nearly 50% surge in value since the start of the year, ethereum's 900% climb is worth examining in context.  From roughly $8 on 1st January to an all-time high of $82 this week, ether has come a long way since its began trading in 2015.  Here are 5 things newcomers may benefit from knowing about the market.  1) It's not an overnight success  Since early 2016, ether has been the second-largest market cap of any cryptocurrency, managing to outshine more tenured alternative asset protocols such as litecoin and ripple, according to CoinMarketCap data.  This sharp increase has taken place as the broader cryptocurrency space has attracted significant capital inflows, rising almost $7bn in value in Q1 2017.  During this time frame, the price of ether returned more than 500%.  When examined over a broader time frame, cryptocurrency's price gains have been even more impressive, as ether has appreciated more than 2,800% since it 2015.  2) It's volume has varied wildly  Ether's trading volume has fluctuated quite a bit during its history.  Trading activity for this digital asset was very modest at times, with 24-hour trading volume falling below $100,000 in some cases. At other times, this activity surged, with 24-hour volume nearing $600m in March.  Overall, however, the market has seen a gradual upward trending, with volume picking up notably in March and April.  3) Search interest is nearing highs  What does search interest have to do with price?  As CoinDesk contributor Willy Woo has put forward – quite a bit given that most traders and buyers Google the price first. (Woo has even described a whole strategy around gaining insights from such data).  Ether's search interest has risen sharply in the last few years, although its upward movement coincided with some significant pullbacks, according to Google Trends.  The cryptocurrency's search interest peaked in mid-March, as the term ""ethereum"" attained its highest point of popularity between 12th and 18th March.  When broken down by geographic region, the search interest for this term has been quite varied, according to additional data from Google Trends.  Switzerland has been the post popular area for these searches over the last five years, with Venezuela coming in a close second, claiming 95% of the search interest.  4) Bitcoin exchanges sell it  Several major exchanges have started offering ether trading to customers over the last few years. Poloniex, the single largest exchange in terms of ETH/BTC volume began offering the currency pair in August 2015.  Kraken, Bitfinex, Coinbase and Gemini followed suit shortly after, with some offering US dollar trading. Other companies provide their clients with over-the-counter (OTC) trading of this cryptocurrency.  Genesis Trading, for example, began offering OTC ether trading in early 2016, and Octagon Strategy started providing this service for its clients in March 2017.  5) Ethereum has its own tokens  Due to the design of the ethereum platform, developers are able to issue their own assets on top of the blockchain network.  The number of token sales for ethereum-based projects has surged over the last year, and is gaining steam. As a result, there's a strong belief interest in these projects could continue to fuel trading interest and demand.  Track the price of ether on CoinDesk's new ethereum price page.

42399827,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyomH,1493752820,Craig Wright's New Company is Building a Bitcoin Core Competitor,"Former Bitcoin Foundation director Jon Matonis doesn't waste any time asserting that his new employer is seeking to disrupt bitcoin's established development process.  Matonis, who joined the secretive startup nChain today, is quick to state that this is the ambition of the London and Vancouver-based operation he now claims has 60 full-time employees, including infamous developer Craig Wright.  As reported by Reuters, nChain was started by Wright, the 46-year-old computer scientist who claims to be bitcoin's pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto (though he hasn't offered much evidence). To date, nChain hasn't offered much to support its assertions that it's now the industry's best-funded startup either, hinting only that it has received more than $100m from Malta-based high-tech private equity fund SICAV plc as part of an acquisition.  Yet, it's a different company that Matonis has in mind in conversation – San Francisco-based blockchain services firm Blockstream.  Long the subject of criticism for the significant financial support it provides to developers working on bitcoin's open-source protocol and its primary implementation Bitcoin Core, Blockstream has been villainized for that group's roadmap for scaling bitcoin, specifically its decision to prioritize innovations that don't alter a hard-coded limit on block size.  Matonis told CoinDesk:  ""I immediately recognized nChain would be an effective challenger to Blockstream, which is definitely needed in the space.""  In conversation, Matonis echoes a familiar refrain, that Blockstream and Bitcoin Core are too intertwined, and that Core's roadmap doesn't have broad community support.  In Matonis's view, bitcoin can once again return to the days when its blockchain was able to quickly clear its backlog of transactions with virtually no fees, while providing more advanced scripting languages – if only other software implementations gain transaction.  Yet, in conversation, Matonis backed away from the idea that nChain was ""taking aim"" at Blockstream, despite his frequent barbs aimed at the company.  Rather, Matonis spoke broadly of what he clarified is nChain's broader attempt to introduce choice into a bitcoin software market he described as in need of competition.  ""There's a lot of resistance to the Blockstream model of pushing everything to a second layer, pushing SegWit and Lightning as the only solutions,"" he said:  ""We don't have to settle for just one approach.""  Product strategy  Such comments come at time when alternative blockchain networks have come to show progress on flashier, more publicly popular updates to their technology, a development that stands in contrast to bitcoin's now years-long scaling debate and offers some weight to critiques of Core's model.  For example, ethereum is hard at work on innovations that would find it redefining how large blockchain networks reach consensus, while litecoin has more quickly adopted innovations originally intended for increasing bitcoin's transaction capacity. (Though it would be wrong to say Core developers aren't progressing).  However, ethereum, which lacks a reference implementation, is seen as more welcoming to alternatives, as its parity and geth clients allow developers a choice between competing softwares. (The benefit, proponents say, is that in instances of attack, should one fail, the other could emerge unaffected).  Former Bitcoin Core developers Gavin Andresen and Jeff Garzik, for instance, are two voices that have supported the idea, the latter calling multiple implementations ""healthier than a homogeneous monoculture"" with one reference implementation.  Against this backdrop, phase one of the nChain's action plan is to release a software development kit (SDK) that Matonis said will likely be given away for free as a means of proliferating alternatives to Bitcoin Core, used today by 85% of network nodes.  Matonis said the SDK will offer users the ability to boot up ""specialized nodes"" that would enable faster block propagation, a feature he contends would make scaling the bitcoin blockchain through a block size increase easier while appealing to node operators.  ""The SDK is going to enable on-chain scaling for bitcoin without degrading decentralization,"" Matonis said.  Already, he said nChain has been in talks with miners about the idea. But, how does this work within bitcoin's existing architecture?  According to Matonis, nChain's SDK will be different from newer Bitcoin Core competitors including Bitcoin Unlimited and Bcoin, which he framed as being more compatible with Core. Bitcoin Unlimited, for example, is a version of Bitcoin Core with new features added. Likewise, BCoin was built from scratch, but to be compatible with Bitcoin Core.  ""nChain allows for other developers to build their own implementations using the techniques and innovations that we've tested here,"" Matonis continued.  In this way, Matonis suggested that nChain believes it could gain enough traction on the network to become a popular implementation for other developers, thereby getting rid of the notion that one implementation is big enough to be called a reference at all.  He added:  ""Our mission is to separate the protocol from its one true reference.""  Hard fork coming?  Asked how the strategy would impact the bitcoin network, Matonis said that nChain's software will enable network stakeholders to choose between the two implementations, a development that he projects could spur a network split if successful.  Should nChain launch its implementation to widespread adoption, Matonis suggested that miners and node operators could be forced to choose between two competing versions of bitcoin's blockchain history – one kept by Bitcoin Core and the other by nChain.  ""This is the governance model for bitcoin, there’s no other governance model. If you can't get traction with pull requests, you launch software propagation battles, and when one reference implementation has greater than 50% or 75%, you can attempt a fork of the network,"" Matonis explained.  Such a scenario has long been the subject of fears in the bitcoin development community. For example, the idea that a hard fork could possibly disrupt the validity of the bitcoin blockchain was factor cited by Bitcoin Core developers in their support for their proposed scaling solutions.  But, given the risk of creating two separate bitcoin assets in the process, why not build a competing blockchain network? According to Matonis, the answer is hashing power.  While cryptocurrency markets such as ethereum and litecoin have recently hit notable highs, it's bitcoin's miners that Matonis believes makes it more valuable.  Still, Matonis reports nChain is working on larger goals to make bitcoin useful beyond just being a store of value, one he suggested would have greater societal benefits.  ""I want to elevate the sector beyond fintech to a more general computation market for enterprise computing,"" he said, concluding:  ""We're still a small group fighting in the weeds. I’m looking beyond, there’s a much larger market across many verticals.""

42399817,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyocR,1493748443,Police Are Holding OneCoin Promoters in Custody in India,"Indian police are continuing their efforts to recoup funds from promoters of OneCoin, a digital currency investment scheme widely believed to be fraudulent.  Local  reports indicate that investigators in Mumbai continue holding more than 18 individuals in custody for further questioning after they were arrested last week by undercover officers.  OneCoin is a purported digital currency sold through investment packages that are often pitched as sure-fire ways of making lots of money. Long accused of being a pyramid scheme, those solicited are often encouraged to purchase large packages of ""tokens"" (which can then be redeemed for OneCoins) and find other buyers to increase the size of their network.  The scheme has caught the attention of law enforcement and regulatory officials in a number of countries, including India. Speaking to The Hindu, a police official said that a new investigative team had been established to focus specifically on complaints tied to OneCoin.  ""We need police custody for investigating the case and to get all details of the scam. We have got custody of the accused till May 3,"" the official said.  That Indian police are shifting resources and seeking additional information from those held indicates that officials in that country are continuing to step up their fight against OneCoin. Recent reports show that other countries, including most notably Germany, are taking aim against the scheme in other ways as well.  As reported last week by CoinDesk, BaFin, Germany’s top finance regulator, issued cease-and-desist letters to major elements of OneCoin’s global operations, effectively ordering it to stop operating in the country.  Reports from last month also indicate that Kazakhstan’s government has also taken steps, ordering a OneCoin advocate under house arrest pending further investigation, according to a report from regional news service Tengri News.

42399819,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyoeP,1493742072,ECB: Blockchain 'Principles' Could Help Spur Adoption,"The European Union’s central bank recently commented on how the economic bloc could move to encourage the spread of new technologies like blockchain.  The commentary was featured in a recent statement from the European Central Bank (ECB) as part of a comprehensive review of the region’s capital markets, a process spearheaded by the European Commission (the EU’s executive branch).  Before wider adoption within EU’s capital markets infrastructure takes hold, however, the ECB said that a number of conditions would need to be right. Namely: establishing the legal nature of digital currencies and the information stored on distributed ledgers, developing standards for interoperability, and creating a cohesive regulatory position across the bloc.  That said, the ECB advocated for an approach that doesn’t limit innovation – something it indicated should be applied to technologies beyond blockchain.  The bank noted:  ""The ECB suggests that the current efforts towards the development of harmonised and principle-based regulation and legislation across Member States be reinforced. This would ensure that market participants developing new services and technologies are not limited by different national legislations and by the risk of unexpected regulatory changes.""  The statements come weeks after the ECB reiterated that it believes the DLT market is too nascent for any kind of new regulatory approach. At the same time, it noted that the tech ""is not mature enough and therefore cannot be used in the Eurosystem's market infrastructure"" – or, to put it more simply, the ECB isn’t quite ready to use blockchain.  The ECB is pursuing research initiatives around the tech, including a joint program begun late last year with Japan’s central bank.

TenneT – which is owned by the Dutch government and is a major utility provider in Germany – is working with companies in both of those regions to test applications of the tech. Underlying the tests is software from IBM, which is a member of the Linux Foundation-backed Hyperledger blockchain project.  The first test, in conjunction with renewable energy marketplace operator Vandebron in the Netherlands, will focus on electric cars, with blockchain acting as a distributed signal network for cars that plug into recharge. In Germany, a separate trial conducted alongside blockchain startup Sonnen eServices will see the two firms use blockchain to create a record of electrical contributions from a series of connected batteries.  For now, the trials showcase a potential avenue for “enabling decentralized flexible energy sources to play a role in the management of the electricity grid"", according to TenneT.  CEO Mel Kroon said in a statement:  ""These pilot projects are part of TenneT’s broader strategy of preparing the electricity system to accommodate the growing volume of renewable energy.""  The trial is the latest sign that utility operators are looking at blockchain as a possible backbone for next-generation power systems, particularly ones that offer real-time data updates and mechanisms for more efficient distribution.

42399806,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbymOh,1493726948,"Bitcoin is Up $60 Today And Closing in on $1,500","The price of bitcoin continued recent gains to start today's trading session, rising $60 in just hours to top $1,460.  Overall, the price of bitcoin has gained nearly 5% across global exchanges, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, to reach its highest value ever recorded. The gains mark the third consecutive day that bitcoin's price has set a new all-time high, and the fourth time it has done so over the last five days.  According to data from CoinDesk, the development also follows a period in which volume has shifted to new markets, namely Japan, where newly enacted regulations appear to have set the stage for a period of more robust trade in the market.  Over the last 24 hours, more than 50% of trading has taken place in Japanese yen, according to data service CryptoCompare.  Notably, the majority of US trading has also seen a migration to Gemini – long one of the lesser traded exchanges and perhaps the one that has most targeted the institutional investor demographic.  Still, it's difficult to tell exactly what is driving the market.  Not only has the market seen its largest US dollar exchange fall victim to banking issues in recent weeks, but bitcoin's price gains are coinciding with the appreciation of a range of other blockchain-based assets, providing evidence that speculation in other markets may be a rising tide lifting all boats.

42399798,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbymGp,1493723719,R3's Newest Regulator Looks to DLT For KYC Testing,"""We realized that we needed to test it ourselves.""  When reading up on blockchain tech and attending conferences proved insufficient, Quebec's financial regulator, Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), decided to take the next step in its quest to better understand distributed ledgers.  To that end, the AMF announced last week that it had joined the R3 blockchain consortium and created a fintech lab to advance its response to new technologies.  The AMF describes the newly established lab as a think tank that will improve its understanding of emerging technologies like the blockchain, both for internal use and for the review of regulations.  As part of the deal, the regulator signed up with the R3 consortium, a group of more than 80 financial institutions developing blockchain applications for the finance sector, and that is increasingly eyeing work with regulators.  For now, it will explore how AMF can improve its ability to carry out its mandate and how blockchain uses cases, like KYC ('know your customer') processes, can be executed, according to Lise-Estelle Brault, senior director derivatives oversight at the AMF.  Brault told CoinDesk:  ""We need to build internal knowledge to have a critical eye and really understand these different use cases.""  Despite recent exits from the consortium, R3 representatives lauded the news as evidence its appeal continues to broaden.  ""We'll be doing proofs-of-concept and use cases in the lab that would appeal, not just to AMF, but the other members in the public sector that they attract as well,"" said Charley Cooper, a managing director at R3.  Education process  Yet, Brault stressed that the AMF's lab is in its early stages and isn't committing to any permanent blockchain projects.  ""Other regulators and central banks are facing challenges that are similar to ours, so we are interested in joining that conversation,"" she remarked, adding that working face-to-face with these institutions was the biggest draw.  Further, blockchain and distributed ledgers are just part of a much wider remit for the lab, she added. One of the first projects it will be tackling is using artificial intelligence to manage regulatory data.  The AMF will now work with academia to help with research projects focused on new technology use cases. The lab plans to hire two university students, in the engineering and technology fields, as interns later in May.  Correction: An earlier version of this article displayed an incorrect AMF logo.

42399790,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbym7y,1493719548,Oracle Plans Blockchain 'Pipelines' to Boost Employee Efficiency,"A new patent application from Oracle suggests the database giant is seeking to harness blockchain to improve its internal workflows.  The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) released the application, entitled ""Managing Highly Scaling Continuous Delivery Pipelines"", on 27th April. First filed last September, the application details the use of ""pipeline blockchains"" to act as distributed information points for product delivery flows.  The sole named inventor cited on the application is Duncan Mills, a software architect for Oracle.  The concept, as outlined in the application, focuses on using the technology's ability to provide transparency as a means to keep data on every employee contributing to a particular work process. This would include how their work is being performed and what their next task entails, in real time.  It further offers resilience for times when access to a central data store is compromised. The application explains:  ""By its nature, the pipeline blockchain approach provides a self-correcting mechanism for recording and reconciling the state of a pipeline after a system failure. For example, if the record store becomes unavailable, pipelines can continue to process in a fail-safe mode using peer-to-peer reconciliation of the pipeline blockchain, thus maintaining the state of the transactions for the duration of the outage.""  Oracle's ""pipeline blockchain"" concept has security implications as well.  For example, a particular project may deal with sensitive or proprietary information. According to the application, the use of the system could allow a worker to see what task is up next ""without having to return control to a central dispatcher"", potentially making their computer vulnerable to outside influence.  ""This is particularly important where the worker is not in a position to check back with a central dispatcher because of security constraints,"" the application goes on to state.  What's more, the idea of using blockchain to facilitate the secure exchange of information is something that Oracle has touched on in the past, including in an article penned last year by Subramanian Iyer, one of the firm's senior directors.  ""Clearly, blockchain has the ability to increase secure data exchange in other industries as well. It also has the ability to make that data transfer simpler and easier between entities,"" he wrote.

42399802,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbymFq,1493712004,The Litening: Will Litecoin Be the First Big Blockchain With Lightning?,"A new test version of the Lightning Network is launching in the coming days, marking its latest step toward a long-awaited live debut.  But, what's most notable about the news isn't that it's occurring (the idea has, after all, been in the works since 2015), it's where the technology will be deployed.  First envisioned as a way to expand bitcoin, Lightning has yet to go live on the world's largest cryptocurrency. And as attempts to enact the necessary upgrade have stalled there, some of Lightning's developers are taking action by moving work elsewhere – to the litecoin blockchain.  This is now possible largely because last week the network passed a technical upgrade called Segregated Witness (SegWit), making it the first major blockchain network to adopt the upgrade since it was proposed back in December 2015. (Other smaller cryptocurrencies, such as Syscoin, have also implemented SegWit.)  Now, just a few days after this milestone, San Francisco startup Lightning Labs is releasing a version of its software for litecoin's testnet.  In interview, Lightning Labs co-founder Elizabeth Stark noted that the software will initially be available only for developers. Though, with SegWit locked in, the hope is that users will be able to use it to move real money for the first time once sufficient testing has been carried out.  Stark told CoinDesk:  ""It's a great example of Segregated Witness in action, right? The litecoin community worked together to activate it, and I think we’ll see the benefits, including those that we're building out on Lightning.”  In this way, Stark now expects that the activation will help demonstrate why SegWit's fix to transaction malleability is believed to be so important for bitcoin.  As such, the news is the latest to advance a larger narrative that finds litecoin seeking a value proposition amid bitcoin's scaling debate. The move is also the latest for Lightning Labs, the startup originally co-founded by the authors of the Lightning white paper, Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja, though both have now moved on to other opportunities.  Easy shift  Among a handful of Lightning Network implementations running on the bitcoin testnet, one, known as lnd (for Lightning Network Daemon), has now been made compatible with both bitcoin and litecoin.  ""We're enabling litecoin to hook into it,"" Stark explained.  Lightning Labs developer Olaoluwa Osuntokun noted that on bitcoin, lnd is compatible with one of a few alternative bitcoin implementations, btcd, which is written in Go. So, in addition to making litecoin-specific additions to the lnd software, the team ported over a version of this software to litecoin.  But just because developers can easily shift over their work, that doesn't mean a live Lightning will be up and running on litecoin soon. There's still a little over a week to go, or roughly 6,000 blocks at time of reporting, before SegWit will activate on the network.  Indeed, Stark doesn't expect that a version will be ready for the main litecoin network that soon, although she said Lighting Labs is working toward that goal.  Litecoin creator Charlie Lee, on other hand, was highly optimistic about the timeline for the upgrade.  ""Soon after SegWit activates on Litecoin, I expect people will be able to send real value over the Lightning Network on Litecoin. This will motivate developers to build out the Lightning infrastructure and wallets,"" he said, adding:  ""So by the time SegWit is activated on Bitcoin, Lightning Network will be ready for mainstream adoption!""  Osuntokun further mentioned that, in addition to improving the Lightning protocol, there are a number of features that he would like to add to litecoin, including a block explorer.  Testbed for bitcoin?  Still, in technology, there's always a long to-do list.  At least one other Lightning Network startup, ACINQ, has also tested Lightning Network on litecoin. Later, it revealed its finding that since bitcoin and litecoin are so similar, the shift doesn't require very many changes.  Still, Pierre-Marie Padiou, CEO of Lightning Network startup ACINQ, also argued that it could still take some time to deploy on the main litecoin network.  ""The results are very encouraging, but it doesn't mean that Lightning Network is ready for prime time on litecoin,"" he said. ""It isn't on bitcoin, either, even if we are close.""  Because of that, the team is focused on finishing a version of the Lightning Network for bitcoin, he said.  ""Our immediate goal is still to finalize a first version, and to achieve full compatibility with other implementations. We believe this is the best way to build a high quality, safe and usable Lightning Network,” Padiou said.  That's not to say litecoin couldn't play a role here.  He concluded:  ”Once this is done, litecoin could serve as a realistic testbed for Lightning Network until SegWit activates on bitcoin.”  Stark seemed agnostic on the point of litecoin solely offering a testbed for bitcoin, noting that some in the community have expressed that sentiment.  ""We'll see if that happens,"" she said.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Lightning Labs.
