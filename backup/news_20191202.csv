In an open call posted to its website Nov. 29, the bank announced that it is searching for tech companies who can build it a “proof of concept” shared KYC system for its banking industry.      “The increasing demand for digitalised financial services has created an opportunity for Sri Lanka to evaluate the possibility of adopting Blockchain Technology to further advance Sri Lanka’s financial sector,” the bank’s invitation to apply read.      The project appears to be a collaboration between Sri Lanka’s central bank and the Sri Lankan tech sector at large, as it involves “experts” from Sri Lanka’s tech finance and tech industries.      A “shared KYC” system as outlined by the press release would allow commercial banks and the central government to share and update customer data on a blockchain.      “It is expected that this would facilitate several potential use-cases that will increase efficiencies in the financial sector,” and “help increase financial inclusion in Sri Lanka,” the release said.      But the release is otherwise short on details. The bank will share the KYC platform’s “high-level design” with the selected candidate: a company with at least two years of experience and a “proven track record of developing and launching mobile applications.”      The open call comes as Sri Lanka further brings itself on par with global financial regulatory standards.      In October, it was removed from the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) anti-money laundering/counter the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) “strategic deficiencies” blacklist, indicating that the country had bolstered its defenses since placed on the list in Nov. 2017.      “The FATF welcomes Sri Lanka's significant progress in improving its AML/CFT regime and notes that Sri Lanka has strengthened the effectiveness of its AML/CFT regime,” the global financial watchdog said in October.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2019/12/02/sri-lankas-central-bank-calls-for-blockchain-based-kyc-proposals,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4dc668955a8df235e39542a255c45cf28cf8904e-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

That's the good news for fans. Less so is that the release of the wallet – called Klip and to be included in the firm's messaging app, KakaoTalk – has been pushed back to sometime in the first half of 2020, CoinDesk Korea reports Monday. GroundX, Kakao's blockchain subsidiary, announced Klip in August, with the plan then being to launch the product by the close of 2019.      With the launch of Klip, Kakao's blockchain subsidiary GroundX will also launch a standalone version of the wallet, Kakao's co-CEO Yeo Min-soo said at a meeting of the governance council for the Klaytn blockchain on Friday.      Coming up first, however, will be a limited-feature browser extension for the wallet which will offer basic crypto storing and trading features, the executive said. Called Kaikas, the extension will work with browsers such as Google Chrome, Firefox and Opera, and will be aimed at more experienced crypto users.      Klip, on the other hand, will be aimed to introduce new users to blockchain-based services, Yeo Min-soo said.

42403623,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgOmx,1575294600,"Power Ledger, Indian Government to Boost Renewables With P2P Energy Trading Initiative","Australian blockchain startup Power Ledger unveiled a plan to test a peer-to-peer solar energy trading platform in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh on Thursday.      The pilot project, drafted by utility company UP Power Corporation Limited and the state’s New and Renewable Energy Development Agency, is aimed to enable households with solar panels on their rooftops to trade energy with their neighbors via a blockchain platform, the firm said.      Power Ledger has joined India Smart Grid Forum (ISGF), a public-private partnership with the Indian government, which will lead the project.      “We're working directly with the government and state utilities to trial a blockchain solution in the Indian energy market,” Jemma Green, co-founder of Power Ledger, told CoinDesk. ""We're gaining momentum globally with the ISGF pilot project in the biggest state in India.”      The first phase of the pilot is expected to be completed in March 2020.      “These results will help shape regulations and the future marketplace to roll out P2P solar energy trading across the state of Uttar Pradesh,"" Green said.      According to Reena Suri, executive director of ISGF, households will be able to set prices, track energy trades and settle surplus solar energy transactions in real time through smart contracts executed on a blockchain. That's made possible by smart meter systems integrated with Power Ledger’s platform.      ""Once the scoping, planning and site selection has been completed and smart-metering infrastructure deployed, Power Ledger will commence the configuration and finalise trading logics for deployments of dynamic pricing Xgrid P2P energy trading platform in consultation with all the key stakeholders."" Green said.      The move comes amid India’s effort to promote blockchain technologies, as well to curb fossil fuel dependence by increasing its capacity to generate solar energy.      On the same day Power Ledger announced the pilot project, Minister of State for Electronics and IT Sanjay Dhotre said the government is preparing a National Level Blockchain Framework.      The new framework will discuss the potential for distributed ledger technology and the need for a shared infrastructure for different use cases, Dhotre said in a letter to address questions related to blockchain research and adoptions from the lower house of the Indian parliament.      Meanwhile, the pilot project also reflects India’s efforts to decrease the use of energy generated by fossil fuel.      According to a report from the National Institution for Transforming India, it explores the financing requirements and business models to deploy 40 gigawatts of rooftop solar by 2022 as part of the government’s effort to generate 175 GW in renewable energy by the same year.      Formed in 2016, Power Ledger hopes to commercialize its blockchain technologies by offering an energy trading platform. In October 2017, the firm raised $23 million through a token sale to develop its software, according to its website.      Power Ledger also secured $1.69 million from the Australian government to participate in a ""smart cities"" trial in the Western Australian city of Fremantle.      The firm’s platform is based on a proof-of-authority network and has its own ethereum-based ERC-20 token, POWR.      ""Power Ledger is continuing to scale our platform within Australia and internationally, growing our technology in the NEM to help energy retailers gain access to a more efficient way of transferring energy through the existing grid infrastructure.” Green said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | WALLET | TOKEN SALE,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/02/power-ledger-indian-government-to-boost-renewables-with-p2p-energy-trading-initiative,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7236e91a32d4aa77c754fa534b9c040a11ac7406-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The incident saw 603 genuine blocks on the Vertcoin main blockchain replaced with 553 blocks written by the attacker, according to the project's lead maintainer, James Lovejoy, in a GitHub notice.      Occurring on Sunday, Dec. 1, the blockchain reorganization caused five ""double spends"" to the value of 125 vertcoin (VTC) worth approximately $29. ""Each of the double-spent outputs are coinbase outputs owned by the attacker and it is unknown to whom the coins were originally sent before being swept to an attacker address after the reorg,"" Lovejoy said.      Put simply, a 51-percent attack can occur when an entity (or entities) gains over half of the hashing power of a blockchain network, bringing the ability to rewrite the blocks making up the ""chain.""      Almost exactly a year ago to the day, Vertcoin saw another 51-percent attack that caused multiple reorgs and was estimated by Coinbase to have cost users over $100,000. After that attack, Vertcoin – which aims to block powerful mining chips called ASICs from the network to keep mining more community based and affordable – switched its proof-of-work algorithm to one called Lyra2REv3.      The latest attack had been seen coming. Lovejoy explained:    ""On Nov 30th 2019, a Vertcoin miner noticed a large upswing in hashrate rental prices for Lyra2REv3 on Nicehash. This was combined with workers connected to Nicehash's stratum server being sent work for unknown (non-public) Vertcoin blocks. I contacted Bittrex, Vertcoin's most prominent exchange, to recommend they disable the Vertcoin wallet on their platform once it became clear an attack was in progress, which they subsequently did.""    The developer continued to say there's ""strong evidence"" that the attack was carried out by harnessing leased hashrate from Nicehash.      ""The attack was originally discovered by inspecting the work being sent from Nicehash's stratum servers, which were sending work for non-public blocks,"" he said.      Why Vertcoin was attacked again is unclear. Lovejoy said it would not have been profitable based on miners' block rewards alone. He suggested Bittrex may have been target, but the exchange disabling its Vertcoin wallet may have prevented more double spends.      An alternative option is that thefts via double spending was not the plan and the attack may have been ""a proof of concept or sabotage attack.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/12/02/the-vertcoin-cryptocurrency-just-got-51-attacked-again,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2269486070ca0eff05b43342ab5a3be6294460f0-1500x965.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403618,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgOh3,1575288000,Dutch Crypto Startups Brawl With Regulators Over Scope of EU Money Laundering Rule,"The Takeaway  The European Union’s anti-money laundering directive, AMLD5, comes into law this January. EU states must decide how to implement the EU directive as it pertains to cryptocurrency.  The Dutch Ministry of Finance (FIN) and Dutch National Bank (DNB) have laid out their own interpretation. Critics say they could do irreparable damage to the young crypto industry.  Independent legal review says the proposed implementation purposefully misled the Dutch Parliament.    Dutch crypto startups are crying foul as regulators in the Netherlands look to implement the European Union’s 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5) ahead of a Jan. 10 deadline.      The firms, which include exchanges and software developers, say authorities are subverting the democratic process and trying to right past wrongs that have nothing to do with the development of a native blockchain industry.      The Dutch Ministry of Finance (FIN) and Dutch National Bank (DNB) are pushing ahead with stringent additions to the EU’s AMLD5 legislation without disclosing them to the Dutch parliament, according to multiple Dutch crypto businesses and a former regulator. They say the authorities failed to pass the new regulations through the proper channels, which include an independent governmental body that reviews legislation before it heads to the Parliament. The Dutch Council of State rejected the new laws earlier this year.      Under the new rules, crypto firms are expected to pay for their own supervision costs and undergo a registration process. The firms see this as as illegal licensing, and point out that amendments to AMLD5 were pulled straight from legislation meant to address regulatory loopholes that were contributing factors in the 2008 banking crisis.    “We do not think it is appropriate to start as a new sector under a supervision financing model that has been explicitly adjusted and weighted up in response to the financial crisis,” crypto exchange Bitonic and crypto regulation body VBNL's Daan Kleiman said in a translated letterhttps://bitcoin.nl/img/posts/408/20191029%20-%20VBNL%20implementatiebesluit%20AMLD5%20v1.0.pdf sent to the Dutch parliament Oct. 30.    “Both the [FIN regulatory] letter and the spirit are at odds with the advice of the Council of State,” Kleiman added.      With less than two months until AMDL5 comes into force, the Dutch crypto community are caught arguing semantics with authorities, which claim to be following both the Council of State’s advice and AMDL5 to the tee.    Haunted by Big Banking    Banking compliance consultant Simon Lelieveldt, who has worked for the DNB and as a Dutch financial historian, said the two entities are trying to be proactive and not repeat past mistakes. Regulators are under pressure from critics who say lax oversight, particularly concerning the Netherlands largest bank, ING, led to the 2008 collapse. ING received a €10 billion government bailout, an amount it eventually paid back with interest.      “If you look at the AML directive in the Netherlands, we had this huge incident where ING was seen to be failing on anti-money laundering measures for about six years,” said Lelieveldt in a phone interview.      “So there's a huge tendency and trend for the central bank to make up for it. The last seven years the central bank is really heavy on integrity supervision because they want to make up for the errors of the past,” he said.      ING was fined $900 million in 2018 for failing to detect money laundering ongoing for years. As Reuters reported at the time, the amount laundered was actually incalculable.      FIN is under similar pressure, Lelieveldt said, as the fraud evaluation from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) comes next year.      “They want to be seen as the best kid in class. So they're doing everything in their powers to come across as an entity that basically implements each FATF rule to the letter and beyond,” Lelieveldt said.      The crypto industry complains that regulators are instituting a licensing regime, when the EU directive only calls for registration, which carries less onerous validation requirements.      FIN says its implementation is registration and that its has made the necessary changes asked by the Council of State. “The draft bill does not include requirements that go beyond the scope of AMLD5,” said Hayat Eltalhaui, FIN’s spokesperson for the financial sector, in an email to CoinDesk.      The DNB did not return questions for comment by press time.      Lelieveldt, Kleiman and others beg to differ, calling the registration de facto licensing. In fact, Kleiman and the VBNL go as far to say it has the feel of domestic surveillance.    FIN, DNB, and Parliament    This past September, the DNB responded to AMDL5 with long awaited guidance, outlining a registration process ahead of the EU’s January 2020 deadline for enforcement. As CoinDesk reported at the time, the guidance was well received in the Netherlands, although hints of further restrictions were raised as the DNB singled out non-Dutch firms.      Multiple crypto businesses have expressed frustration at stringent add-ons which could lead to added operating costs. Lelieveldt estimated Dutch companies, many of them small firms, could have to pay €150,000 per year to meet the changes.      Under AMLD5, the EU’s 28 nation-states required to toughen up know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) procedures for crypto exchanges or custodial services.      While many EU nations, such as the U.K., have added onto the AMLD5 rules, the Netherlands claims to not have made any adjustments.    According to legal consultation firm Hart Advocaten N.V., FIN and DNB copy and pasted additions from the 2007 act into AMLD5 and then proceeded to deny such additions before Parliament, calling into question the ethics of financial regulation. The accusations were detailed in a letterhttps://bitcoin.nl/img/posts/408/Advies%20't%20Hart%20advocaten%20-%2004112019-%20implementatiewet%20witwassen%20-%20niet%20beleidsarm.pdf on behalf of Bitonic.    “They're basically thumbing their nose to the [Council of State], ignoring what they are saying,” said Lelieveldt. “They are claiming we're doing European implementation and that's it. That’s what rattles everyone. They're basically messing up the democratic system.”    Local businesses minding the gap    While nothing has passed Parliament yet, crypto firms in the Netherlands are taking a risk- averse approach, with many companies declining to speak to CoinDesk publicly out of fear of reprisals such as fines.      Deribit, an Amsterdam-based derivatives exchange, has even hinted at the possibility of exiting the Netherlands as AML/KYC requirements are placed on its exchange this coming January.      “If we continue to operate in the Netherlands, we will need to have those things implemented,” said CEO John Jansen in early October on the Flippening podcast on the coming Dutch interpretation of AMDL5.      Deribit did not return CoinDesk’s request for comment.      Earlier this month, the DNB, FIN, the Dutch IRS and the Financial Intelligence Unit sat down with the top crypto companies in the Netherlands for a five hour presentation on regulatory guidance.      Attendee PJ Datema, founder of Crypto2Cash, said while he believes the regulators are putting new wine in old bottles, he remains upbeat overall, particularly as baseline capital requirements to operate in the crypto field were not proposed at the meeting.      Most of the 150 or so participants at the roundtable were small shops offering single products, Datema said. Financial authorities that typically deal with traditional markets are still learning how to regulate crypto firms.      “[Regulators] kind of accept it but because you can’t ignore it anymore,” Datema said.      Arthur Stolk, managing director at Dutch cryptocurrency fund Icoinic who also attended the meeting, would prefer one unified EU framework so crypto companies can get one license for the whole EU, rather than applying in each state      “It’s a missed opportunity,” he said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2019/12/02/dutch-crypto-startups-brawl-with-regulators-over-scope-of-eu-money-laundering-rule,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7dfd54591896e66f167ac8dbd7526910b515b28e-1500x931.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403604,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgOXD,1575284808,Bullish Bitcoin Chart Pattern Still Intact Despite 7% Price Drop,"View  Bitcoin has erased more than 45 percent of last week's rally, but the outlook remains bullish with prices holding above three-day chart support at $6,847.  A re-test of trendline resistance at $7,665 looks likely. A violation there would expose Friday's high of $7,870.  Acceptance below $6,847 would invalidate a bullish reversal pattern on the three-day chart and expose the recent low of $6,515. That looks unlikely, though, with the MACD histogram turning bullish above zero.    Bitcoin has pulled back sharply over the last 48 hours, but is holding well above support near $6,850 keeping the short-term bullish bias intact.      The top cryptocurrency is currently trading near $7,330, representing a 7.3 percent drop from the high of $7,870 registered on Friday.      With the pullback, bitcoin has erased more than 45 percent of the corrective rally from the six-month low of $6,515 hit on Nov. 25.      As a result, many in the investor community, including the likes of popular trader and analyst Josh Rager, believe the relief rally has ended and the overall bearish trend, as represented by the drop from $10,000 to $6,500, has likely resumed.      That argument appears logical with the daily chart reporting a fresh lower-high pattern.    Daily chart and 8-hour charts    Bitcoin jumped to $7,800 on Friday, as expected, but faced rejection at the resistance of a trendline sloping downwards through Oct. 26 and Nov. 15 highs.      The cryptocurrency also failed to close (UTC) above $7,775 – the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the drop from $10,350 to $6,511.      In effect, the bulls could not preserve the upside momentum after Friday's rejection at key levels and the cryptocurrency has faced selling pressure ever since.      Bitcoin has now established a ""bearish lower high"" at the falling trendline resistance.      Further, the 8-hour chart is now reporting a flag breakdown, which implies a resumption of the sell-off from recent highs near $10,350.      All that said, a bullish reversal pattern confirmed last week on the three-day chart is still valid.    3-day chart    BTC created a hammer candle in the three days to Nov. 26, signaling seller exhaustion following a notable sell-off.      More importantly, the cryptocurrency rallied 8 percent in the three days to Nov. 29 and found acceptance above the hammer candle's high of $7,380, marking a strong follow-through to the hammer candle and confirming a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.      The bullish pattern would be invalidated if and when bitcoin find acceptance under $6,847 – the low of the green candle.    Hourly and daily charts    The pullback from $7,870 lacks substance, with trading volumes dropping over the last 48 hours. A low-volume pullback is often short-lived.      Meanwhile, the daily chart MACD histogram, an indicator used to identify trend changes and gauge the strength, is offering a bullish signal with an above-zero reading.      As a result, bitcoin looks unlikely to violate support at $6,847 and may rise back to the falling trendline resistance, currently at $7,665.      The short-term bullish case would strengthen if prices manage to clear the lower high at $7,870 established over the weekend.      It's worth noting that, as per technical analysis theory, setups on longer time frames take precedence over intraday charts. So, while bitcoin is looking heavy on the 8-hour and daily charts, the pattern on the three-day chart warrants caution on the part of the sellers.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/02/bullish-bitcoin-chart-pattern-still-intact-despite-7-price-drop,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/adb321ad043c4035c46de14b9ee6bf2f20221190-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403616,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgOi2,1575280800,A Plan to Decentralize Bitcoin Mining Again Is Gaining Ground,"Braiins, the company behind one of the largest bitcoin mining pools, recently released a code spec that could be promising for decentralized mining.      The spec, Stratum V2, could significantly change how bitcoin mining functions and would add security and efficiency to mining pools, the entities that organize miners spread across the world.      Although it aims to improve bitcoin mining pools in a number of ways, the primary benefit comes from a component that reduces one of the most pressing problems in bitcoin: mining pool centralization.      ""If this protocol does everything it promises, 'mining centralization' as an argument will be completely dead,"" bitcoin developer and educator Jimmy Song said.      Meanwhile, Square bitcoin developer Matt Corallo, one of the designers of the protocol, wrote in a recent Reddit AMA: ""This is huge for mining centralization. Instead of being focused on the centralization of pools (which is the world we're in today), we can focus on the centralization of actual miners [and] farm owners!""      Last year, Corallo revealed BetterHash, a plan to combat the centralization problem in mining pools. Now Braiins and Corallo are pooling their work to build one protocol that fixes a number of current mining pool issues.    Silver bullet?    Mining has long been a difficult proposition for individual miners. In the early days to bitcoin, miners from around the world began connecting to so-called mining pools to earn a more consistent paycheck. All of the miners worked in tandem and when one member of the pool got lucky, the thinking went, the entire pool benefited.      In time, weighted mining pools emerged as a safer, more profitable way of mining by taking in all of the bitcoin earned by their miners and redistributing them based on mining power contributed. Unfortunately, according to recent data from Blockchain.info, only three mining pools control over 50% of bitcoin's mining power, thereby centralizing the mining power in a few hands.      This is a problem. When one of the miners in a mining pool wins a block and rakes in the 12.5 bitcoin reward, the mining pool decides which transactions go into that block. Bitcoin experts worry that these centralized entities could use this power to censor transactions they don't like.      To prevent this, Stratum V2 supports ""job negotiation"" modeled off of Corallo's BetterHash. This changes the relationship between the miner and the mining pool. Instead of mining pools deciding what transactions go into blocks, miners decide which ones to include.      ""[If] there are cases of transaction censorship in the future, we have a security measure in the protocol that miners can use to circumvent the censorship,"" Capek said.      This also means that miners, not mining pools, will be able to vote on protocol upgrades to bitcoin if Stratum V2 is adopted by mining pools.      ""With the job negotiation protocol, miners can also choose their block header version field. This allows them freedom in any potential voting via BIP8/BIP9 style mechanism,"" Capek said.      All that said, Capek stressed that the new specification is not necessarily a ""silver bullet"" for mining centralization. He pointed out that the mining pools that want to censor bitcoin transactions could simply opt-out of adopting the protocol.      ""At the same time it's important to mention that a pool that would 'intentionally' perform such censorship would not allow its users to negotiate their jobs,"" he said.      Meanwhile, Luke Dashjr, veteran bitcoin coder, argued on Twitter that there are other aspects of mining centralization that still need to be addressed. For example, the fact that only a handful of companies produce mining hardware, the computers made specifically for producing bitcoin, is also a grave threat to decentralization.    Thwarting attacks    Decentralization isn't the only draw in Stratum V2. Mining pools will have an incentive to adopt the new protocol because it will save them money and prevent attacks that could cause them to lose rewards. First, it makes transferring data back and forth more efficient. It could also make stealing mining pool hash power much harder.      ""Last but not least, we have addressed the security aspects by allowing fully encrypted and authenticated communication using the current state of the art technology called 'Noise Protocol Framework,'"" Capek said.      This peer-reviewed technique is the same technology used by the mobile messenger WhatsApp and bitcoin's lightning network.      Braiins is still finalizing a few features in the specification, such as deciding which encryption algorithm to use for hiding data from snoops, Capek said. But a version is available to test and most of the Stratum V2 specification draft is now up for review.      Capek expects it to take at least 12 months for mining pools to adopt the protocol.

42403612,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgOe6,1575277200,Is Technical Analysis Prophetic or Preposterous? We Asked 7 Crypto Traders,"The death cross. Just say it out loud. It doesn't sound good. And it's not. In fact it's quite bad.      For most of October, analysts in the bitcoin market were warning that the death cross was coming – using what's known in the trading business as technical analysis.      Technical analysis, or TA for short, is the art of divining future price movements by studying charts detailing how various assets have traded in the past. Patterns are discovered. Those patterns are compared with patterns that occurred previously. The assumption is that the past patterns will hold in the future, providing price predictions and a good chance to profit.      A death cross, in the practice of TA, occurs when the line tracking an asset’s price average over the prior 50 days falls below the line tracking its 200-day moving average. The appearance of a death cross is considered the start of a bearish trend: The last time it happened in the bitcoin market, in March 2018, prices tumbled by more than half over the next nine months.      So, it was considered unusually bearish when this year’s death cross finally appeared on Oct. 25, or thereabouts. Bitcoin’s price closed at $8,662 that day, and over the next few weeks it would tumble more than $2,000. Some analysts say the price drop was caused by a crackdown on cryptocurrency speculation in China. But TA believers say the whole thing was apparent from the charts.      “Once the death cross happens, we're in a situation where the moving averages are screaming bearish,” says Big Chonis, a pseudonymous 41-year-old Massachusetts man with 43,000 Twitter followers and a separate, subscription-based TA feed. He asked that his real name not be used, he said, to avoid diluting the power of the Big Chonis brand, but added in a phone interview that he typically nets $3,000 to $4,000 a week as a full-time trader, relying primarily on technical analysis.      The concept that traders could reliably make money – or avoid losing it – from watching when a blue line might cross a yellow line seems like phony-baloney to many investors in traditional finance (not to mention to journalists and other observers of crypto trading). But in bitcoin markets, TA is ubiquitous. Binance, one of the world’s biggest crypto exchanges, said in a Nov. 22 research report that TA was the second-most commonly followed investment strategy in markets for digital assets, after high-frequency trading.      Joe DiPasquale, CEO of BitBull Capital, argues that TA helps break through the hype that often drives crypto prices high or low.      “The recent surge at the end of October, due to the Chinese media hype, is a good example of an unsustainable speculation-driven move that has now returned to our previously indicated support around $8,100,” he said. “Technical analysis is what led us to believe that the high reached after Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke was ephemeral and would retrace back to just above $8,000.”      TA was originally developed for markets where trading has a long history and data is bountiful. For stocks, TA outperforms analysis based on business fundamentals, including factors like earnings growth, according to an extensive 2015 study by three Israeli researchers. The finding held for investment horizons of one to 12 months.      True believers say TA is even more important in crypto markets since nobody can really yet confidently pinpoint the fundamental value of bitcoin, invented by a small cadre of libertarian computer coders just 11 years ago. Is it a store of value, an inflation hedge, a digital form of gold? The future of money? Or simply the rewards for the owners and operators of the computers that are helping to keep the world's biggest blockchain running? It might be all of the above.      “Absent some real fundamental news, people rely on charts and price and volume,” said Greg Cipolaro, a former Citigroup stock researcher who now helps run the cryptocurrency-analysis firm Digital Asset Research. “It's always kind of been a dark art.”      With little else to go on, traders put their faith in the charts. They say to themselves, and anyone else who will listen, that classical technical analysis would tell us right now that the price of bitcoin is about to break a lot lower -- like, in the next week or so, because this candle chart looks like this, and that candle chart looks like that; in other words, you should wait a little longer before you go back into your accumulation phase. Even Big Chonis acknowledges there are limits to TA’s usefulness, or at least its application. In his Twitter feed, he says, he tries to point out “notable things,” or patterns that he sees in the charts. But he acknowledges that he’s not quite as prolific with the price predictions: “You're right in saying that you're not seeing me say buy, buy, buy, sell, sell, sell all the time, because it's all subjective.”      What’s interesting is that even many bitcoin investors who scoff at the chart-auguring, preferring, say, the long-term digital-gold narrative, usually keep an eye on the charts, which can become self-fulfilling. So many people are looking at the same price points as key levels of support and resistance – TA-speak for when bitcoin is believed to be unable to penetrate some invisible moving price ceiling, or when it can't really go any lower – that the market often behaves accordingly.      For example, many traders set up their systems to automatically sell out of a position if the price of bitcoin suddenly falls below a certain threshold; the exercise is known as a stop-loss order and roughly translates to, ""Get me out, now, before I lose any more money."" Once those stop-loss orders get tripped, the price move accelerates, and pretty soon a lot of novices trading bitcoin futures are getting ""REKT."" That's crypto-speak for when heavily leveraged traders get liquidated due to a margin call. Rapid selling as those liquidations take effect just drives the price down faster, and bitcoin has just proved yet again how volatile it can be.      “If you understand what everyone else is doing, you understand the trade even better,” said David Martin, chief investment officer at Blockforce Capital in San Diego. “It's basically technical analysis on technical analysis.”      CoinDesk spoke to seven professional crypto traders and analysts about TA. Here’s what they said:      Greg Cipolaro, Digital Asset Research:      I'm not a believer in technicals. If I found something that was consistent and would work, I would use it, but since I haven't, it just seems like you're talking about throwing around triangles. Absent some real fundamental news, people rely on charts and price and volume, and in that respect it's more like FX or commodities short term-trading, but to me it's just not where I play. It's always kind of been a dark art. There are times when you see support and resistance, such as with even numbers – $9,000, $10,000. When it breaks through those levels, then all of a sudden the price breaks up or down, but that's because a lot of people are sort of keying in on the same thing.      Joe DiPasquale, BitBull Capital:      At BitBull, technical analysis is a key part of our active management, and works well in concert with news analysis to reveal probable movement patterns and downside/upside limits. Since crypto markets are highly volatile and generally speculation-driven, technical analysis provides key indicators of price movements, especially support and resistance zones. The recent surge at the end of October, due to the Chinese media hype, is a good example of an unsustainable speculation-driven move that has now returned to our previously indicated support around $8,100. Technical analysis is what led us to believe that the high reached after Xi Jinpeng spoke was ephemeral and would retrace back to just above $8,000. Using technical analysis enables us to trade around crypto’s volatility, buying low and selling high with confidence. For example, in the last year (11/1/18-11/1/19), Bitcoin has returned 44 percent, while BitBull's Opportunistic Fund has returned 101 percent, about 2.3 times more.      David Martin, Blockforce Capital:      When I my first got into crypto back in 2016, I was doing it purely from a technical perspective. I didn't understand bitcoin or what it could do, but I just wanted to trade it because it had a lot of volatility. That was largely based on support and resistance, wave cycles and fibonacci retracements. We don't use it for the fund. We're mostly using machine-learning algorithms. But what I see is that technical analysis actually works better in crypto because you don't have the fundamental analysis that you have in equities and other asset classes. What else are you going to trade off of? For example, if you're trading Apple, you might have so many outside macro factors that influence the price of the stock. Technical analysis could be one part but not the only. In crypto, it's still retail dominated, so everyone's looking at chart patterns. So if you understand what everyone else is doing, you understand the trade even better. It's basically technical analysis on technical analysis. Once you figure out, where does everybody think there's support, where does everybody think there’s resistance, you can set your trade up based on how everyone else is reading the market.      Martin Garcia, Genesis:      Traders care about technical analysis very much. They're in the market for a short period of time; investors less so. When we're making a trading decision here, we look at the macro environment, we look at the fundamentals, and then we look at the charts. We do have to look at the technicals because there are less clear fundamentals in crypto. By and large, this is something that is almost a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you look at technical analysis as a tool that a lot of traders are looking at, and everybody's looking at the same indicators, they're seeing the same things and adjusting their trading strategies accordingly.      Big Chonis:      I am a firm believer in technical analysis and how it can translate to bitcoin charting and identifying where we are in the market structure. Bitcoin normally goes sideways; there's a range most of the time, and bitcoin price action can be very boring. Because this is a thin market, there isn't a lot of retail-driven price action that's pushing this. It wouldn't take more than a couple million market-buy to push the price several hundred dollars, just based on the fact that the retail market is so thin. I like to take a broader 50,000-foot view, look at the daily chart, the 3-day, the weekly, to get an overall sense of where we are in the market. I accept the fact that if I'm looking at a certain timeframe on my chart, and I say, Hey, if the indicator hits this level, it's a good buying opportunity, but then if it keeps falling, that tells me I might be on the wrong timeframe.      Dan Matuszewski, former Circle trader now a partner at CMS Holdings:      I tend to be of the mindset that it's mostly hocus pocus. We do want to know where people are placing their stops, but when we trade we're really just trying to find inefficiencies in the market and arbitrage those out. We're doing that more than say, OK, bitcoin just crossed the 50-day moving average. That's just not our game.      Nicholas Merten, DataDash trader:      In the short term I believe that technical analysis is completely irrelevant. The only kind of TA that would be relevant is naked trading, where you're using support and resistance as levels where you look to enter and exit, on the hourly, or the daily chart – looking to see when the last lows and highs were set, and if you can see consistency. If you can see certain candles always topping out at specific price, say $8,000 multiple times, if you're long bitcoin, it may be a good time to take some profits or possibly close your position. When it comes to indicators, I only use them on weekly timeframe. It is much easier to gauge momentum on longer term timeframe; the MACD on the weekly chart is so good at being able to predict general bottoms and tops.
