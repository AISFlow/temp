SHIB trade with good volume, breaking out from a range channel as the price eyes a rally past to a region of $0.0000135. SHIB&apos;s price remains strong on the daily timeframes as the price trades above the 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) but faces resistance at 200 EMA. Shiba Inu (SHIB) price showed some great price action as the price rallied, trying to mimic the price of DOGE after seeing the price of DOGE rally by over 150%. The price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) tried to replicate this rally as the price broke out from its long-range movement, but the price has recently struggled.

42413693,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlBqTs,1667518693,"$1B Crypto Hack Fears Spur 20% GALA Plunge, but Firm Implies It Attacked Itself as a Safeguard","Chaos ensnared Gala Games late Thursday as fears of a potentially billion-dollar hack – or maybe a rug pull – drove its native GALA token down 20%.  Meanwhile, a firm apparently related to the crypto play-to-earn platform said the platform had actually effectively attacked itself to prevent bad actors from absconding with users' money.  Concerns developed after a single blockchain address appeared to mint over $1 billion worth of GALA token out of thin air. When crypto watchdogs PeckShield flagged that, pNetwork – which provides routing infrastructure for decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming tokens, including apparently GALA – seemed to imply that it was behind the mint.  ""We noticed pGALA wasn’t to be considered safe anymore and coordinated the white hat attack to prevent pGALA from being maliciously exploited,"" the firm said, suggesting the new tokens were printed as a way to help pNetwork drain a faulty PancakeSwap pool.  ""All GALA tokens on Ethereum as well as the underlying bridge collateral are SAFE,"" pNetwork tweeted, explaining the trouble was due to some kind of ""misconfiguration of the p.Network bridge.""  Decentralized exchange platforms like PancakeSwap use pools to let users swap between currencies without the use of a middleman. The newly printed pGALA tokens were used to drain pGALA pools of other currencies, pNetwork said.  ""For the time being, please consider the existing pancakeswap.finance pool to be invalid,"" pNetwork tweeted. According to pNetwork, a new, properly configured pool will be launched, containing the same balance as the old one.  ""A new pGALA token will be created to replace the old compromised one and airdropped in the coming days to those who had pGALA before the pool was drained,"" pNetwork said.  In the world of crypto, though, where rug pulls – or project founders stealing everything – are common, that announcement didn't totally settle down fears. Though pNetwork encouraged users to ""not initiate swaps to and from this pool,"" many confused (or skeptical) users bought and sold the soon-to-be-deprecated tokens anyway as its price dropped.",NEGATIVE,GALA,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MINING | GALA | CAKE,"Krisztian Sandor, Sam Kessler",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/03/1b-crypto-hack-fears-spur-20-gala-plunge-but-firm-implies-it-attacked-itself-as-a-safeguard,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/62b68de21857f012bbbfd89671c69ad7d65c59c8-2106x1454.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411714,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfKDA,1667512689,How to Find Your Community in Web3,"I’ve been writing about Web3 – a term broadly used to describe the next phase of the internet – exclusively for over a year now, and one thing I’ve noticed is the emergence of empty buzzwords to describe vague concepts. But one of those buzzwords – “community” – is central to the mission of builders and investors in the space. Even when my screen-induced dopamine reservoirs evaporate, I still believe in the Web3 community, vibes and all.  This is a good thing because as a journalist I am decidedly now a part of the Web3 community. Some may poke fun at our frequent use of Twitter Spaces and proclivity for shorthand slang – “gm” is a catchall greeting you’ll likely see splattered across crypto Twitter at any given time. But beneath the Ape profile pictures and fast-paced hype cycles is a collective of people all contributing to the formation of a decentralized, blockchain-driven future.  Along my Web3 journey I’ve met interesting people, gained relevant career skills and fostered meaningful professional relationships. As the development of Web3 continues to expand, so too have the ways in which people can connect and form communities.  If you’re looking to find your place in the ever-evolving world of Web3, here are some ways to connect with like-minded individuals, pulling examples from my own experiences along with insight from industry professionals.  Explore social platforms  As communities continue to pop up across a fluid Web3 landscape, there are several platforms known for attracting large numbers of crypto enthusiasts.  Evolved from its early days as just a platform for short streams of consciousness, Twitter is now a popular platform for people to share news, create dialogue and find community. This is particularly true for the crypto-curious and Web3-native crowds, who have embraced functionalities like Twitter threads and Twitter Spaces to engage in dialogue with a global audience. Twitter Spaces can be especially useful for people who want to listen in on a conversation before diving in – the Clubhouse-style audio tool is a mix between an expert podcast and a multiway phone call with your peers.  You can also follow influential thought leaders and artists in the space, who are sometimes marked with a blue check mark to indicate that their identity has been verified by Twitter. It’s important to make sure you’re only following official accounts, as scammers are finding increasingly creative ways to impersonate influential figures on the internet.  If you’re looking for a list of who to follow on Twitter, Crypto Witch Club’s ultimate Web3 follow list is a great place to start. Blockchain software technology company ConsenSys has also compiled a list of 40 Twitter accounts that matter, while blockchain development platform Alchemy has a list of the top Web3 developers to follow.  Discord is another popular platform for degens (an affectionate crypto term short for “degenerates”) to communicate with one another. The video game communication platform created for online hangouts has been embraced by Web3 platforms and projects, many of which have a dedicated Discord server. To manage the flow of communication, these communities assign moderators, who are often volunteers or individuals who are personally vested in a particular project.  “To me, [volunteer moderators] are always impressive because you can see how much people care about these projects,” said Aleeza Howitt, head of business development at Cowri Labs, the creator of decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem Shell Protocol.  Along with Twitter and Discord, there are several other notable “Web2” platforms that seem to be maintaining their relevance among Web3 advocates. Reddit, a tried-and-true community forum launched in 2005, is still a go-to place where crypto enthusiasts can crowdsource information and find subcommunities tailored to their interests. In July, Reddit launched an NFT marketplace and the platform recently made headlines for boasting more than 2.5 million active crypto wallets.  Similarly, Meta – the parent company of Facebook and Instagram – has embraced digital collectibles on its platform, with Instagram now testing minting and selling NFTs for a select group of U.S. creators.  And while established social media platforms adapt to new blockchain technologies, decentralized social media alternatives that use more censorship-resistant storage methods and crypto payment rails are also cropping up. For some, these platforms function as solutions to what many in the Web3 space consider to be a legacy of privacy violations and data overreach from social media mega-corporations.  Decentralized social media options are mostly still in the startup phase, though early waitlists are said to be brimming with enthusiastic first movers. For instance, Twitter founder Jack Dorsey’s decentralized social network, Bluesky, reportedly received 30,000 signups last month. Meanwhile, other Web3 social platforms have been gaining a steady user base of regular contributors, such as the decentralized publishing platform Mirror, which offers an alternative to tools like Medium, Substack or WordPress.  Finally, while the metaverse as a concept is still in its infancy, there are several blockchain-based platforms like Mona, Decentraland or The Sandbox that host regular community events and offer virtual hangout spaces featuring personalized avatars. In fact, a number of metaverse art galleries, virtual worlds and music festivals continue to pop up across these platforms.  Look for IRL meetups and local events  If you live in a major city anywhere in the world, chances are sites like Meetup.com can offer a menu of in-real-life (IRL) events nearby. Sure, it may seem a little analog – why connect with your neighbors when you can learn inside the metaverse? – but even Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has been to a local meetup at the University of Toronto.  Of course, plenty of online-only networking opportunities exist for the Web3-curious (webinars and Zoom hangouts are still popular options.) But when possible it’s helpful to connect in person with people in your geographic area. That way you can discuss your city’s unique regulatory environment as it pertains to crypto, as well as brainstorm possible Web3 use cases for what your local community needs. You may even meet developers or professors from local universities, along with regional policymakers, who are likely building the foundations of Web3.  Connecting IRL is also a way to combat the inevitable computer-chair tech-neck that comes with the Web3 lifestyle while bridging the gap between digital and physical interactions.  And if there’s no meetup in your area, you can start one. Years ago, Howitt ran a New York City meetup group, which drew a small but passionate crowd. Regardless of the turnout, she says the one-on-one conversations were well worth her time.  “We only had two or three people there,” she said, adding that she’s now best friends with one of the attendees. “He is now one of my very close friends in the space,” she said. “So even if your meetup has only two people, those two people are going to have a lot to talk about.”  Attend a crypto conference  Beyond your local community, it might be worth engaging with global communities of thought leaders, NFT artists, startups, affinity groups, developers, marketing specialists and art collectors by attending one of the many crypto conferences that have popped up in recent years.  There were at least 137 Web3-focused conferences globally in 2022, according to a spreadsheet curated by Crypto Nomads Club, a community for digital nomads and frequent travelers who meet at various crypto events around the world. The events can vary in price, and can range anywhere from free to $5,000 for VIP access passes. Frequently, attendees have the option to pay for their tickets in either fiat currency or crypto.  Many of these conferences also have satellite events planned around them, creating additional opportunities for networking with Web3 professionals. For example, in the Crypto Nomads Club spreadsheet the tabs for the last two conferences – DevCon and ETH Lisbon – contain between 100 and 120 satellite events each. Some seasoned crypto professionals may even forgo buying tickets to the official conference when satellite events are often good opportunities to make connections, said Howitt.  “There are always satellite events,” she said. In fact, traveling to conference cities with an open mind acted as a catalyst for Howitt’s current tech career: “I was staying with friends, and I ended up going to [blockchain] conferences. And I've continued that tradition now. It's my job now.”  Most early blockchain conferences and hackathons – collaborative coding events – grew from Web3’s cypherpunk tradition, Howitt added, starting from the first-ever Ethereum developer’s symposium, DevCon 0, in 2014. Things have evolved over the years, and today you can find conferences tailored to different subcommunities in Web3, like Bitcoin Miami, ETH Devnver, NFT.NYC and DeFiCon.  In the weeks before or after these conferences there are often events known as hacker houses, or mini tech incubators, lasting a few days or weeks. Ecosystems and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) often sponsor hacker houses to incentivize developers by having them compete for project funding. Most still boast a collaborative and friendly spirit, such as the H.E.R. DAO hacker house at the Avalanche Summit in Barcelona, which funded 25 women developers.  Dive deep with an online educational group  Education is hugely important in Web3, even for so-called experts. As the space continues to grow and change, countless online groups have sprung up to help onboard newcomers and discuss industry updates.  Several low or no-cost educational groups exist that can connect you to hundreds of peers at whatever level you may be at. These groups typically host online Zoom sessions, throw IRL parties, arrange conference meetups, produce podcasts, hold Twitter Spaces and more. They also crack some jokes from time to time.  You can start with a free newsletter, such as CoinDesk’s new Learn Crypto Investing newsletter. Look for both general educational platforms and affinity groups built for and by people you relate to. Women and non-binary people can check out educational groups like Boys Club, Eve Wealth, BFF and SheFi. Members of the Latinx community can find resources at Web3 Familia, founded by OP Crypto venture partner, Christian Narvaez and co-founders Orlando Gomez, Francisco Izaguirre and Magdalena Madrigal.  “Web3 Familia is an educational community focused on Latinos globally,” Narvaez told CoinDesk. “We're Latino-focused, but we're not Latino-exclusive. We do everything in both Spanish and English. We also interact with others, so there's a broad network that goes beyond just the Latino community.”  Apply for funding through blockchain ecosystems  For more advanced Web3 users with big ideas for a new protocol or decentralized application (dapp), blockchain ecosystems typically have a pool of resources to help jumpstart a project. As an investor himself, Narvaez encourages all first-time founders to seek grant funding or enroll in an incubator program before pitching your ideas to venture capitalists (VC). Becoming a grant recipient of one of the big blockchain players is not only a great way to find fellow builders and embed yourself within an ecosystem, it has financial upsides, too.  “[Ecosystems like] Near, Polygon, Solana and Ethereum have grants for projects to have their initial kickoff,” Narvaez said. He suggests using these grants to build a minimum viable product (MVP), or a “rough draft” version of your dApp for early use. That way, founders can keep as much equity in their project as possible later on.  Once you’ve tested and proven your idea, you might seek out VC money from Web3-focused firms, assuming you’ve done the legwork, have a good product and foster the appropriate relationships. “I happily engage and help in any way possible,” said Narvaez, “whether it's connecting people to our venture team for funding possibilities, and if it doesn't fit the thesis of the fund, [potentially] connecting with other VCs in the ecosystem.”  Use your best judgment and DYOR  While these tips may open new channels for community building, engaging in online discourse may also invite scammers or spam into your inbox. Use the hashtag #NFT or #NFTCommunity on either Twitter or Instagram and it may trigger a deluge of bots sliding into your DMs asking for the private keys to your crypto wallet (which you should keep safe and never give to anyone). Not to mention the alarming number of fake crypto accounts across every social media platform, the nightmarish rug pull scams and market-swaying TikTok virality – all of which have, at least once, caused me to wake in a cold sweat.  Crypto investing is not for the faint of heart, but building and making relationships should be fun and stress-free. Some days, engaging with the crypto community feels like swimming with sharks (or their more benign cousins, the crypto whales). On other days, I feel proud to be associated with the collective of internet users working to align the future of our monetary system with prosocial principles. It’s important to remember that many people believe that Web3 is a long game, and making relationships along the way is ultimately more fruitful than getting lost in the hype (and proceeding crashes).  There’s a popular phrase in the crypto community – DYOR – which aptly stands for “do your own research.” Personally, I attend Web3 events with a few healthy boundaries in place and maintain similar levels of skepticism and curiosity in most virtual-first interactions.

42413691,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlBqUo,1667511905,"Market Wrap: Ether, Other Cryptos Rise Despite Unsettling Inflationary Concerns","Price Action  More storm clouds formed over the global economy on Thursday as the U.S. Labor Department announced a small dip in weekly jobless claims just a few hours after the Bank of England boosted its interest rate by a jumbo-sized 75 basis points, matching recent U.S. hikes.  The two unrelated events underscored the difficulties central banks are facing in cooling the economy and stemming inflation, and they sent equities downward.  However, bitcoin and ether, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, were recently trading flat at roughly the same levels they’ve maintained for much of the past two weeks. BTC was holding steady at about $20,200, up a smidgen over the past 24 hours, while ETH continued to hover over $1,500, a 2% gain for the same period.  “Hawkish monetary policy and macroeconomic uncertainty rage on,” CoinDesk crypto markets analyst Glenn Williams wrote. “But crypto investors ultimately have little else on their mind than cost basis.”  Most other major tokens were trading solidly in the green, with the tokens of Web3 platforms Filecoin and Storj rising more than 14% and 10%, respectively. The increases followed an announcement by Meta Platforms, parent of Facebook and Instagram, that it would use decentralized storage product Arweave to archive creators' digital collectibles. AR, the native token of Arweave, rose 60% earlier in the day. The CoinDesk Market Index rose by about 2%.  The job market may soon offer more concrete evidence that central bank measures to tame rising prices are working. Job cuts by online retail giant Amazon and ride-share service Uber sent equity markets falling. The tech-focused Nasdaq dropped 1.7%, while the S&P 500 was off 1%. Amazon warned that business would be declining. Safe haven gold continued a recent series of declines, and was down 0.4%.

42413686,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlBqQ8,1667511691,Circle Begins Putting Reserves Into New BlackRock Fund,"Circle Internet Financial has begun moving the reserves for its USDC stablecoin into a dedicated fund set up by BlackRock and registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the company disclosed Thursday.  The Circle Reserve Fund – a government money market fund managed by BlackRock Advisors – has been in the works for months after BlackRock initially sought to register it in May. Circle will be its only eligible investor, and the stablecoin issuer has already started putting its reserves there, expecting to be “fully transitioned” by the end of March.  ""This is a wrapper for the USDC reserve that brings benefits of that wrapper to the USDC and the ecosystem,"" said Circle Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Fox-Geen, in an interview with CoinDesk. All of the company's short-term Treasury assets will be phased into the fund, though the cash reserve -- about 20% of the total -- will still be held in partner banks, Fox-Geen said, because it allows for customers to more easily redeem USDC around the clock.  But that's a temporary measure, he explained, because the ultimate goal is for BlackRock to apply – in time – to get the fund into the Federal Reserve's reverse-repo program. Such funds are usually granted that access, so Fox-Geen said he hopes to see the cash portion of Circle's reserve eventually held at the Fed.  These efforts will ""improve the risk profile and oversight and the disclosures around USDC reserve,"" he said.  The current circulation of $43.9 billion in USDC is backed by $44.1 billion in cash and short-term U.S. government bonds, according to weekly company disclosures. The portfolio of the new fund will also consist of U.S. Treasury bonds.  The assets will be held at the Bank of New York Mellon, according to Circle, where the fund will be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which requires an independent board and daily reports on the portfolio.  Circle had previously begun a financial relationship with BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, when the firm invested in Circle’s funding round announced in April.  Stablecoin issuers have been eagerly awaiting legal guardrails in the U.S., but legislation that would set up the rules failed to reach the finish line this year. Lawmakers in the House Financial Services Committee expect to get back to their bill in the next session, though it could still be months away. Whatever the outcome, policymakers have generally agreed that stablecoins operating in the U.S. will need to be entirely backed by reserves such as U.S. Treasury bonds.  Fox-Geen said the company is heartened by the legislative efforts and the talk of eventually granting stablecoin issuers access to Fed accounts, but that they see their own approach as ""a way of us doing it quicker.""

42394111,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXm7r,1667508799,Coinbase Deal Shows Google Is Committed to Crypto – How Much Depends on Whom You Ask,"Going by recent headlines and what the company says, one would assume Google is diving into crypto. Yet, some see the tech giant’s choice of partner – Coinbase – as proof Google is just dipping its toe.  A couple of weeks ago, Google and Coinbase put out a joint press release titled, “Google Cloud and Coinbase Launch New Strategic Partnership to Drive Web3 Innovation.” A few days later, Google Cloud introduced its Ethereum blockchain node engine.  This comes months after the search engine giant’s cloud computing section started a digital assets team. The hiring of former PayPal exec Arnold Goldberg to run Google’s payments division in January was touted as “a broader strategy to team up with a wider range of financial services, including cryptocurrencies,” in a Bloomberg article and echoed in a lot of crypto press, including here.  On the surface, it would seem Google is getting aggressive in its approach to crypto. However, some see this as a clear sign Google isn’t betting the farm on Web3 the way Meta has, but is instead looking to treat crypto the way it treats other many industries – a customer for its services.  Breaking down the Coinbase deal may give a clue as to how Google is approaching crypto.  “This partnership has touched on several Coinbase businesses including Exchange, Commerce, Cloud Nodes, and Prime,” wrote Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau on Oct. 11. “On the Exchange side, Coinbase acts more like a consumer of Google Cloud technology, but on Commerce, Cloud Nodes and Prime, Coinbase acts more like a technology provider to Google's customers.”  See also: Web2 'Delenda Est,' You Say? | Opinion  A blog post by Coinbase Chief Product Officer Surojit Chatterjee breaks the two companies’ tie-up into four parts:  1. Google Cloud will let some customers pay for services using some crypto via Coinbase.  2. Coinbase Cloud’s node service will use Google Cloud’s BigQuery enterprise data warehouse so Coinbase customers can have access to Google’s blockchain data.  3. Google will use Coinbase Prime for custody services.  4. Coinbase will use Google Cloud for “exchange and data services.”  CoinDesk asked Coinbase for further comment but was referred to Chatterjee’s blog post.  “Google Cloud’s partnership with Coinbase is a continuation of our deepening engagement with the Web3 ecosystem,” said Richard Widmann, Google Cloud’s head of strategy for digital assets, in an email to CoinDesk. “We view the evolution of blockchain technology and decentralized networks today as analogous to the rise of open source and the internet 10 to 15 years ago.”  He went on to say the partnership with Coinbase ‘builds on our deep history working on open-source projects,” and that as crypto goes “more mainstream, companies will need scalable, secure and sustainable infrastructure.”  Seismic shift?  To be sure, few things get retail investors and crypto enthusiasts more excited than seeing a major brand adopting crypto in some way. And when one of those companies happens to be fourth-most valuable by market cap on Earth, it’s easy for crypto’s cheerleading squad to think a seismic shift is underway.  That’s not how one long-time crypto adviser to one of Coinbase’s competitors sees it:  “If Google really thought crypto was going to be a big deal for them, they would have used a smaller custodian for their coins,” said the adviser, who requested anonymity because he consults in the space. “Google can get a better deal with a smaller custodian than it can with a bigger company like Coinbase.”  In his view, the use of Coinbase Prime for custody as well as allowing a select group of Google customers to pay for services with crypto is an indication that these were tacked on to the real essence of the deal: Coinbase is now a customer of Google Cloud.  “Google is competing with AWS [Amazon Web Services] for financial services customers, so to say they have one of the largest crypto exchanges as a customer helps their credibility with other potential customers,” the adviser said.  The other features of the Google-Coinbase deal, in other words, are just added bells and whistles, he added, because custody is more of a side business for Coinbase.  Coinbase generated custodial fees of $22 million in the three months ending June 30, not even 3% of the company’s total revenue of $808 million in that quarter. Another $22 million in income over that time was taken in from “other subscription and services revenue,” a category the company defines to include “revenue from Coinbase Cloud, which includes staking application, delegation and infrastructure services, Coinbase One, and other subscription licenses.”  Coinbase may be a giant in crypto but to Google’s parent, Alphabet, it’s merely a flea. The tech behemoth saw $6.8 billion in cloud services revenue in the three months ending Sept. 30. That’s billion with a B. And even that figure is just plain adorable next to Alphabet’s Q3 revenue of $69 billion.  And while partnering with the likes of Google would seem positive for Coinbase, it’s hard to convince some short sellers to change their minds on the exchange.  “They sound desperate,” said one portfolio manager at a $1 billion fund that is short Coinbase’s stock. “This reminds me of all these rinky-dink software companies that put out press releases saying they’re working with IBM. Yeah, IBM can sell their software now in their distribution network, but they’re doing it alongside thousands of other software they have deals with. So what? No one cares. They should focus on trading revenues and that’s it.”  Inroads into enterprise  Others, however, see this as a positive for Coinbase.  “If you look at what BNY Mellon announced a couple of weeks ago, you have a lot of custody providers now chasing after financial services providers and corporate investors getting into crypto,” said James Wester, director of cryptocurrency and co-head of payments at market intelligence firm Javelin Strategy & Research. “Coinbase is clearly looking for additional inroads into that space.”  See also: Coinbase Files to Support Ripple Against SEC Case  Wester added that he doesn’t see how Google would get a better deal with a smaller custodian. “Is that what a smaller custodian really wants to be their pitch, ‘We’re easier to push around?’”  For up-and-coming players, any foray by Google into crypto is a good sign for the industry.  “Similar to other large tech players, Google has slowed hiring compared with last year, but they have continued to be aggressive in hiring for their crypto division – making the initiative a core focus,” said Jeff Feng, co-founder of Sei Network, a small layer 1 blockchain that launched in September. “Crypto has been held back so far by lack of infrastructure, which Google Cloud will step in to propel forward.”  Given that Alphabet already has around 186,000 employees, though, aggressiveness in crypto is all relative.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Lawrence Lewitinn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/11/03/coinbase-deal-shows-google-is-committed-to-crypto-how-much-depends-on-whom-you-ask,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/02f834ffa59b64a082d25018b61a2ddd0e0384a2-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42413678,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlBqFq,1667508781,Canadian Energy Provider Hydro-Quebec Proposes Stopping Electricity Supply to Blockchain Industry,"Hydro-Quebec, the energy supplier of the province of Quebec in Canada, proposed to stop providing electricity to the blockchain industry to battle growing power demand, the utility company said in a new proposal.  The plan doesn't explicitly mention what type of blockchain industry they are targeting, but the Canadian province has been an ideal place for crypto miners to setup due to its abundant sources of clean, renewable energy.  There had already been talks among the miners in Quebec that current rules are too restrictive to grow their operations in there. This new proposal could make it even more restrictive for the miners to operate in the province.  Read more: Why Crypto Miners Are Expanding Beyond Quebec  Hydro-Quebec's plan called for the Regie de l'energie, or Canada Energy Regulator, to suspend the allocation of a 270 megawatts (MW) already planned for the industry. ""In light of the significant increase in the anticipated demand for electricity and the tightening energy and capacity balances, Hydro-Quebec filed a request with the Regie de l’energie regarding suspension of the allocation process to the blockchain industry,"" the company said in a statement. ""Under this process, approximately 270 MW were slated to be dedicated to cryptographic use over the short term, but the allocation of that amount of capacity to this use would increase pressure on current balances,"" the statement added.  The new proposal also said that it anticipates an increase of 25 terawatt hours (TWh) or 14% in Quebec’s electricity demand over the 2022–2032 period.  Some of the miners that are currently operating in Quebec include Bitfarms (BITF), Hive Blockchain (HIVE) and Argo Blockchain (ARBK).  Bitfarms, which invested C$350 million in Québec since its inception and currently employs over 100 employees, said that its power agreement remains in place with Hydro-Québec. ""Its power agreements with Hydro-Québec remain in place and expects that its current and future bitcoin production will continue for the foreseeable future without disruption,"" the miner said in a statement. ""The Company continues to look to expand its operations in Québec and add more jobs across the region,"" Bitfarms added.  The energy use of the miners have been a topic of debate globally. Most recently, A group of seven Democratic lawmakers in Washington, D.C., led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), said they are looking into the energy usage and carbon emissions of the bitcoin mining industry in Texas, where many miners have setup their operations. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) also expressed concerns that bitcoin mining's enormous demand for energy in Texas is straining the state's grid, adversely impacting consumers and U.S. climate goals.

Additionally, Cash App generated $37 million of bitcoin gross profit in the third quarter, down 12% from a year earlier.

As of Sept. 30, the fair value of Block's bitcoin investment was $156 million based on “observable market prices,” which was $45 million greater than the carrying value of the investment after impairment charges, the company noted.

Indeed, the world&apos;s premier cryptocurrency was designed for this purpose. Bitcoin and gold (GLD) share many similarities, but there are also some key differences which, in my opinion, make Bitcoin a superior form of money to gold.Standing on the Shoulders of a GiantBitcoin was made to mimic gold because it is designed as a store of value, and over the course of human history, gold has risen as the best store of value and money available.Humans always have coveted gold around the globe, even though it has no significant &apos;industrial&apos; use, which makes it such a great form of money. It is readily available because humans have been storing it since the dawn of time, but it is also hard to obtain. Also, it is malleable and easily divisible.All of these factors make gold not only a good store of value but good to use in trade. Gold is relatively abundant, making it easy for a society to define its prices in gold, but it is also hard to obtain/mine, meaning it has value and, more importantly, a stable value.In an imperfect world, gold is as close as we had to perfect money.For this reason, Bitcoin was made to mimic gold, at least in two key ways.

42413676,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlBqGm,1667507394,"Coinbase Cuts Q3 Losses in Half, Sees Crypto Headwinds Continuing Into 2023","Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) cut its third-quarter losses by 50% to $545 million from $1.1 billion in the second quarter, the company reported Thursday, as the company reined in costs and cut workers, and also increased its interest income.  However, its transaction revenue continued to be significantly impacted by macroeconomic and crypto market headwinds, which it expects to continue into 2023, as well as trading volume moving offshore, the company said in its shareholder letter.  Transaction revenue was $366 million, down 44% from Q2, driven by lower trading volume. Among the factors Coinbase cited for this decline was that “trading volume has been shifting away from the U.S., where our business is concentrated.” It noted that this shift is partly due to the “perception of uncertainty” that some digital asset issuers may have about the U.S. regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies.  Meanwhile, subscription and services revenue increased 43% sequentially to $211 million, driven by higher interest income. Rising interest income had been seen by some analysts as a potential bright spot for Coinbase given rising short-term rates. Total operating expenses were $1.1 billion, down 38% versus Q2.  Overall net revenue of $576 million was shy of the FactSet analyst consensus estimate of $646 million and down from $803 million in Q2. The company ended Q3 with $5.6 billion in cash, in addition to $483 million in crypto assets, which the company believes “puts us in a strong position to manage through the crypto winter.”  For 2022, Coinbase said it remains ""cautiously optimistic"" that it will operate within the $500 million adjusted EBITDA loss guardrail that it previously shared, based on the assumption that crypto prices do not deteriorate significantly and that customer behaviors don't change. ""For 2023, we’re preparing with a conservative bias and assuming that the current macroeconomic headwinds will persist and possibly intensify,"" Coinbase concluded.  Coinbase shares rose about 3.8% to $57.90 in after-hours trading on Thursday after falling 8% during the day's trading. Coinbase shares are down more than 75% this year, compared to bitcoin’s roughly 56% decline. Coinbase’s stock has plummeted this year with the crypto and equity market rout leading to a slowdown in retail trading. In response, the crypto exchange slashed around 1,100 jobs in June and focused on controlling costs.  On Coinbase's earnings conference call, management expressed optimism in their platform, but was cautious about the macro environment. Still, CEO Brian Armstrong struck an optimistic note.  ""In the down markets, you get to focus on building,"" Armstrong said, adding that innovation is still occurring and that many institutions continue to dabble in the sector and prep for when macroeconomic conditions improve.  Armstrong also said he expects USDC to be the de-facto CBDC in the U.S. The company said it benefitted from being engaged in the USDC ecosytem during the third quarter, according to its statement. Coinbase entered into agreements with the issuer of USDC, pursuant to which Coinbase shares any revenue generated from USDC reserves pro rata based on the amount of USDC distributed by each respective party along with the amount of USDC held on each respective party’s platform, the statement noted.  During the quarter, Coinbase announced a partnership with BlackRock to allow customers of the giant asset manager to trade crypto through the exchange, and also partnered with Google to accept crypto payments for cloud services.

Security tokens are regulated tokenized assets issued on the public blockchain that represent an investment in an enterprise providing a profit share or equity stake to the holder. They are publicly traded on a regulated market and interact with smart contracts, which lowers costs and increases efficiencies. That said, security tokens are not cryptocurrencies.  Security tokens mimic the market for traditional equities. But unlike stocks, for instance, securities are available to trade 24 hours a day, every day of the year and settle instantly and directly to an investor’s wallet.  See also: Why Investors Have Been Slow to Trust Security Tokens | Opinion  Because of their versatile nature, design flexibility and the regulatory setting, security tokens may be the answer to bankruptcy recoveries that investors (and creditors) have been looking for and awaiting.  Bankruptcy doesn’t mean it's over for tokens  In a typical corporate bankruptcy proceeding, creditors of the cash-strapped firm are likely left with a shortfall on their initial investment. Courts and trustees are appointed to pay back these investors as assets are recovered over time.  Traditionally, once a bankrupt firm files for restructuring its remaining assets will be moved to a bankruptcy estate. Those assets are available for distribution to creditors, who typically will not have any rights to the new and restructured enterprise. This process shuts investors out of future profits.  Instead of the status quo, what if creditors leveraged the power and versatility of security tokens? These Security and Exchange Commission (SEC)-regulated assets would be a tool for token holders to participate in the possible future equity appreciation and profits of the restructured enterprise.  More likely than not, businesses that file bankruptcy today prove profitable over time. Why should creditors and investors be blocked from a company’s rewarding future?  Issuing security tokens to investors allows them to participate in future cash flows or revenue of the company, but doesn’t necessarily lead to voting rights. Additionally, the token can be designed to act like preferred equity, thereby giving certain token holders priority on profit distribution and aligning it closely with preferred shares of a traditional company.  The crypto industry today is seeing a number of bankruptcy dealings – including failed lenders Celsius and Hodlnaut. Every creditor should carefully consider security tokens as an option.  Tokenized profit sharing: how it works  While issuing the security token, the issuing company either registers the token with the SEC as a private offering or becomes an issuer of a publicly traded equity token. The issuer of the security becomes a public company under the oversight of the SEC, as applicable for all other public entities.  After the company completes the initial coin offering (ICO), tokens are deposited directly into each participant's wallet and trading begins on a public market offered by a SEC registered broker-dealer. Any token holder is free to offer his/her tokens for sale or accumulate more in the market.  This registration process is well established and follows the traditional SEC-approved protocols for issuing equity. As with traditional registrations, each company must present a prospectus that properly reflects the nature of the entity, risk factors and characteristics of the token offering.  Security token initial coin offerings (ICO) and distributions are registered on a public blockchain and recorded and monitored by an SEC-regulated transfer agent. Token holders must also complete know-your-customer (KYC) onboarding to a broker-dealer.  Once this documentation is completed, the issued security instrument (the security token) provides the same regulatory protections offered by the SEC to any holder of a public security. This level of transparency and the benefits of blockchain-enabled self-custody make the asset class attractive.  ICOs over IPOs  Security tokens are no longer new and have been proven as secure and effective digital financial solutions in a variety of use-cases. It has also been proven time and again that ICOs provide superior issuance processes and secondary markets than initial public offerings (IPO).  Peer-to-peer systems – where the issuer is connected directly with the security token holder on a fully-regulated, end-to-end trading platform for issuing, minting and instant settlement – simplify the process.

Instead of the door closing in creditors’ faces from shortfalls in bankruptcy, security tokens give them access to a public and regulated market for their share of unpaid debt – providing an opportunity to recover losses through an equity stake in the restructured company.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Renata Szkoda,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/11/03/how-security-tokens-can-benefit-creditors-in-bankruptcy-restructurings,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ab8ce2a99846ca19259bcfe8ef4bb956bcc38e5c-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420887,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtZOv,1667505022,Bitcoin Holders Continue to Shrug Off Macro Data,"Hawkish monetary policy and macroeconomic uncertainty rage on.  But crypto investors ultimately have little else on their mind than cost basis. On a quiet trading day that saw bitcoin and ether sink slightly, and the Bank of England deliver the latest, global interest rate body blow – its highest increase in 33 years – investors continued to focus almost exclusively on how much they paid for an asset.  To be sure, macro data remains important as cryptocurrencies react increasingly to the same stimuli that have affected other assets for decades. Jobs and productivity reports, energy prices and Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, for example, have all jarred markets over the past year.  However, crypto investors have grown increasingly adept at pricing in such events and others, and are less likely to be caught off guard, which accounts for bitcoin’s lack of major movement in recent months.  On Thursday, bitcoin was trading at almost exactly the same mark it held in mid-June, undisturbed by the Federal Reserve’s fourth consecutive jumbo rate increase, GDP declines, hawkish remarks from Chair Jerome Powell and socio-political turmoil.  Through four consecutive 75 basis point rate increases, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has formed a base that, depending on the week, has hovered over $19,000 or $20,000 since mid-June. This broad threshold will likely serve as support moving forward.  The world turns but the asset often criticized for its volatility has not – or certainly not as much as leading equity indexes this year.  Bitcoin’s relative strength  Bitcoin’s relative strength index (RSI) is currently 56, which is only slightly above neutral, and bitcoin’s price is within 2% of its 20-day moving average.  Much of the pain from 2022’s price declines appears to have already flushed through the market.  Glassnode’s UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) graphic highlights a spike in BTC acquired near the $20,000 price point.  This trend highlights a resetting of cost basis as bitcoin holders who purchased at higher levels exited their positions to alleviate financial distress.  By contrast, newer investors entered into long positions between $19,000 and $21,000 but have not been impacted to the same extent.  This trend also coincides nicely with the Volume Profile Visible Range (VPVR) tool, indicating high volume nodes at $19,200 and $20,300. A high volume node refers to an area of significant price agreement and can often serve as support for an asset.  Ultimately, despite the macro headwinds that have been roiling financial markets, crypto holders appear to have already shed much of their pain.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/03/bitcoin-holders-continue-to-shrug-off-macro-data,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/602898d401b5600fa4bd63bed275e603aa758f1b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Follow CoinDesk Brasil on Twitter.  Brazilian payments company CloudWalk has become the first crypto firm to be authorized by the Central Bank of Brazil as a payments institution.  The license will allow CloudWalk to offer credit cards to users and provide payment accounts to businesses. In addition, the company will now be the first crypto firm to connect directly with Pix, the Brazilian government's payment system, which has 126 million users.  In December CloudWalk launched a stablecoin pegged to the Brazilian real, the Brazilian digital real (BRCL), which currently operates on a proprietary blockchain. The stablecoin already serves as cash back for transactions made on CloudWalk’s Infinite Pay – the company's point-of-sale platform.  “With this license, we show that we are a reputable company, and we have the freedom to act as virtual currency issuers to make financial transactions of our stablecoin in our wallets,” Pablo de Mello, partner and commercial director at CloudWalk, told CoinDesk.  In November, CloudWalk raised $150 million in a Series C funding round at what was then a $2.15 billion post-money valuation, according to the company. (Post-money valuation is value after outside financing and/or capital injections are added to a company's balance sheet.)

This means that these gains and losses would directly hit these companies’ earnings. The other choice would be to have companies record the swings in the value of their crypto holdings in “other comprehensive income,” which wouldn’t impact earnings.  Last month, FASB signaled its support for fair value accounting for cryptocurrency over the current system of treating them as intangible assets, meaning any declines in value must be permanently recorded as non-cash impairments, while gains are only recorded when the assets have been sold. Fair value accounting means that any crypto losses or gains would be reported immediately, as they would for other traditional financial assets.  Companies that hold large amounts of bitcoin on their balance sheets such as MicroStrategy (MSTR) have been pushing FASB to adopt fair value accounting for crypto, saying it would encourage institutional adoption of digital assets.  “My bias is just to push [cryptocurrencies] through income and make it simple,” Bloomberg quoted Cannon as saying at a securities industry accounting conference. “But that’s just me.”  Cannon is one of seven FASB board members.

42413680,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlBqJa,1667500884,Bitcoin Draws Stability From $20K Price Floor as Traditional Markets Slide,"Notoriously volatile bitcoin slid but stayed relatively stable on Thursday as traditional markets fell on news of the Bank of England’s biggest rate hike in 33 years and the prior day’s move by the U.S. Federal Reserve.  Some crypto analysts think the $20,000 price level for bitcoin (BTC), which for weeks had served as a price ceiling, now is acting more like a floor.  “Bitcoin at the $20,000 level also has a lot of technical support from miners and institutional buyers, who view that level as psychologically important,” said Michael Safai, managing partner of crypto trading firm Dexterity Capital.  Bitcoin was trading around $20,200, down 2.1% in the past 24 hours. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization stayed above the $20,000 level for the 10th consecutive day, after previously failing below the critical price mark for 18 straight days.  The CoinDesk Market Index rose 1.3%. Ether (ETH) slid 4.4% to $1,540 as of press time. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 0.6%.  Bitcoin's relative stability reflects the “slow yet tangible decoupling from stocks” in recent weeks, according to Safai.  BTC’s support at the $20,000 level “should show markets how confident long-term holders remain,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, wrote in a note on Thursday.  The U.S. dollar got a boost in foreign-exchange markets from the Fed’s rate hike and Chair Jerome Powell’s speech suggesting more interest rate hikes likely are ahead. The two-year U.S. Treasury yield was up to 4.68%, the highest since July 2007.  Crypto data and analysis firm IntoTheBlock’s data shows the 30-day correlation between the BTC price and U.S. Dollar Index dropped to -0.77, the most deeply inverse relationship in a month and a half.  As interest rates rise, Safai said, “shorter-maturity U.S. government bonds returning anywhere from 4%-5% at nearly zero risk will look good against almost any other asset, including crypto which still has its share of macro sensitivity.”  Now all eyes are on Friday’s U.S. jobs report, with Powell indicating the labor market’s strength is a key metric the Fed is closely monitoring.  Economists surveyed by FactSet estimate the U.S. economy probably added 200,000 jobs in October, slowing from the 263,000 added in September but still a robust pace.  “There could be some increased sensitivity to the jobs report tomorrow if it’s not great,” said Safai.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/03/bitcoin-draws-stability-from-20000-price-floor-as-traditional-markets-slide,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5ccbe33cc0bfdff74622b8c60d1605ebb9a78f6e-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Related Reading: Institutional Investors Remain Bullish As Short Bitcoin Sees Outflows If the digital asset is unable to hold this level and bears are able to drag its price down below, then ETH will likely see $1,300 on its way down. Below, $1,500, support is weak given the recent sell-offs that have followed the recovery in price. Thus, it lies just above $1,300 before the losses reach a block. As for the current resistance, it still lies above $1,600 for any significant pushback. This is because Ethereum&apos;s price remains firmly above its 100-day moving average, with a firm middle point between this and the 200-day MA sitting at $1,800. Thus, bears continue to fight to hold any level that could prevent such a recovery.

42413694,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlBqWg,1667494296,"NFT Platform ImmutableX’s $66M Unlocking Looms, Putting Sell Pressure on IMX Token","ImmutableX, a platform for non-fungible tokens, is set to release $66 million worth of IMX tokens in an unlocking event that will enable early private investors to sell some of their holdings and potentially tank the token’s price.  A total of 110 million IMX, representing more than 5% of the token’s total supply, will be freed from vesting, an ImmutableX spokesperson told CoinDesk.  Vesting stands for a period when investors in a company’s stock or a crypto project’s token cannot sell their assets. As the vesting period expires, the investors are allowed to relinquish their holdings, applying selling pressure to the asset’s price.  The unlocking is scheduled for Saturday, Nov. 5 at 13:00 UTC, according to the firm.  IMX recently has been trading at 60 cents, meaning these private investors may book a 500% profit on their early investment if they decide to sell.  “We see no concerns surrounding this upcoming unlock, and even if some short-term selling should occur,” Robbie Ferguson, co-founder of Immutable, wrote in an email. “The top 30 IMX holders, representing 85% of the remaining tokens, have committed to holding – many of whom are long-term equity shareholders of Immutable. For remaining IMX private sale holders that do wish to sell, new investors, including Coinbase and Kenetic Capital, have been lined up to absorb any sell pressure.”  TokenUnlocks, a website that tracks crypto token unlockings, sports slightly different data. According to the site, 255 million IMX tokens – more than 12% of the total supply of the token – will be freed from vesting on Nov 5. Some 120 million tokens belong to private investors. The other 135 million are dedicated to project development, which ImmutableX already committed to relocking for at least another year, the spokesperson said.  ImmutableX enables users to create and trade non-fungible tokens (NFT) cheaper and faster on the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum has been known for its high transaction costs – so-called gas fees – at times when high traffic clogs the network. Video gaming chain store GameStop built its own NFT marketplace using the ImmutableX platform, which went live this week.  The project’s parent company, the Australia-based Immutable, raised $260 million from private investors in venture capital fundraising rounds, including from Sam Bankman-Fried’s Alameda Research, Singaporean state investment fund Temasek and Chinese tech giant Tencent.  The soon-to-be released 110 million IMX pertains to investors in a private token sale that occurred before the token appeared on crypto exchanges in November 2021. These investors bought IMX for around 10 cents, per data on CryptoRank, a cryptocurrency price and analysis site.  Expect volatility  Unlocking events inject volatility into the market, attracting traders’ attention to make money from sudden price swings.  Data shows traders are betting that the price of IMX will fall as the unlocking approaches. Funding rates turned negative on most crypto exchanges, according to Coinglass, meaning that traders are overwhelmingly positioned for shorting the token, and will be looking to profit from a potential price drop.  Recently, crypto gaming project Axie Infinity endured a massive unlocking event, releasing $215 million of AXS tokens in late October. AXS’ price dropped 24% through the week in anticipation of the unlocking. Then, when Axie started to release the tokens, a short squeeze suddenly pushed the price up 7%, liquidating $1.6 million in short positions.  IMX was recently trading at 60 cents, up 4% in the last 24 hours and 93% down from its record-high price in November 2021, according to CoinGecko.",NEGATIVE,AXS | IMX,AXS | BUSINESS | TRADING | IMX | MX,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/03/nft-platform-immutablexs-66m-unlocking-looms-putting-sell-pressure-on-imx-token,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f00fea0f24a3ec871b05c45af0324d4f22c8851b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407251,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUKnkD,1667493154,"In the Colombian Andes, Figuring Out How Crypto Can Save the Climate","COCORNA, Colombia – At the end of September, a group of crypto and climate nerds descended on Colombia’s mountainous rainforests to discuss how they can work together to save the planet. It was, to say the least, an event to remember; complete with hydrotherapy, a sharing circle, getting lost in the woods in the middle of an evening storm, nightly bonfires, hints of infighting and a sense of honesty rare to crypto conferences of today.  The event was organized by the Blockchain Infrastructure Carbon Offsetting Working Group (BICOWG), which aims to support crypto projects with a climate focus. Members of the working group were at the retreat, including representatives of event sponsor Regen Network, a layer 1 blockchain company that is building a marketplace for tokenized natural assets.  Also present among the diverse 50-odd participants were representatives from major layer 1s including Solana, Filecoin, Ripple and Hedera Hashgraph; the Global Blockchain Business Council industry association; Verra, the world’s largest voluntary carbon offsets issuer; and a number of different crypto-climate projects big and small, old and new. There was even a Chinese internet-of-things (IoT) firm.  The inaugural BICOWG retreat took place at Tierra de Agua, an eco-hotel near Cocorna, about an hour southeast of Medellin. The significance of the venue was not lost on the retreat participants. Running through the hotel is a stream that ends in the Samana River, one of the tributaries of the Magdalena River, which traverses most of Colombia from the Andes to the Atlantic, irrigating crops and livelihoods along the way. The Samana is the last free-flowing river in the Antioquia region of Colombia because others have been dammed to harvest hydropower.  Antics  The three days were jam-packed with activities, some of which, upon description, will sound like the kind of tech-hippy antics for which WeWork’s Adam Neumann was ridiculed.  There was a hydrotherapy session, when attendees sat under an icy waterfall in their bathing suits, then rubbed themselves with guava juice (for exfoliation) before entering a steam bath.  One afternoon some 30 or so of us headed for a hike to a nearby Indigenous community. We entered the bamboo and clay houses of members of the Wiwa tribe, who still live in a traditional way. Under candlelight, the Wiwa explained the importance of balance between the energy of the north (symbolized by the eagle) and the south (represented by the condor). Between these poles, they believe, is the hummingbird, in perfect balance.  Most of the activities were held in a large room at the hotel with a high, conical ceiling and no walls. A hummingbird happened to be nesting right in front of the speaker’s area, in a hanging lamp shade, quite a coincidence given the visit with the Wiwa tribe. The symbolism was not lost on the attendees, and many pointed it out throughout the retreat.  Each of the three nights the group gathered around a bonfire, and the retreat closed with a sharing circle, at which each of the 50 participants spoke about their takeaways from the experience.  As New Age-y as some of these activities seem, the end result was that it drew closer this community of people genuinely interested in climate-positive action. The group, many of whom were initially strangers, worked productively together to come out of the retreat with solid action items.  Regeneration focus  The term “ReFi” for “regenerative finance,” is envisioned as the antidote to “degenerative finance,” the type of economic system we are in today, which many at the retreat claim is leeching the blood out of the planet and its people. Regenerative finance is building economic models that actually resuscitate the natural environment and human communities.  “It’s a meme,” explained Antonio Paglino, who leads ReFi Barrichara, another region of Colombia that is currently in the early stages of being “regenerated” through a collaboration between the local community and crypto. “Next year we might be using another term” but the mission will be the same, he said.  I asked Jahed Momand, co-founder and general partner at climate-focused venture capital firm Cerulean Ventures, if working on climate-positive solutions makes him more hopeful about the future of the world. He said, “Absolutely not” with the resoluteness that one declines their least favorite food. The world will fundamentally change for the worse as a result of the climate catastrophe, it’s the degree that they are fighting for, he said.  It was clear to me that the attendees were quite realistic about their goals and how they could achieve them.  The idea of regenerative finance is fascinating. It brings together a holistic approach that takes into account social, economic and political aspects of how blockchains can build markets that make the world a better place, instead of unleashing crypto-based financial freedom on the masses and hoping everything works itself out.  One for all and all for blockchain  The main focus of the retreat was to get all the different projects talking to each other about interoperability and how to avoid duplicate efforts.  Perhaps due to this focus, close to zero shilling of projects happened during the three-day event, a remarkable achievement within the crypto community. One of the participants pointed out later that this is exactly what set this group apart – they weren’t after the spotlight or money.  The phrase “getting our house in order” was repeated at several of the workshop presentations as people emphasized that internal divisions must be ironed out before the ReFi movement is ready to start promoting itself on the world stage. As an outsider, it was hard to get a glimpse of the divisions among this small group but the signs were there. Many expressed their surprise that arguments hadn’t broken out.  At the end of the retreat, several working groups were formed, split along different categories of action (social, technical, structural, etc.) to continue the process of achieving true interoperability. As several of the participants noted at the sharing circle, “the proof is in the pudding,” and the success of the event will be judged by whether anything concrete comes out of it.  Through the workshops, conversations swirled around the subject of ego; whether it can or should be mitigated to pursue interoperability. An interesting division appeared on the second night during a Jeffersonian dinner, at which each table had to discuss a topic and take into account everyone’s thoughts.  My table went pretty deep down a philosophical rabbit hole, discussing how societies construct egos, how people’s egos are a defense mechanism, and how all of this is detrimental to collaboration and achieving harmony etc. By contrast, the table right next to ours concluded that ego should not be mitigated but harnessed to achieve greater goals.  Carbon obsessed?  Also during that Jeffersonian dinner, Casson Trenor, an environmental activist, called out the movement’s fixation with carbon offsets. Perhaps because these are the easiest thing out of which to make tokenized markets, given that carbon markets are already fairly developed, the ReFi movement has focused a lot on carbon credits. Other “nature-backed assets” are in the works, but few have materialized yet.  After two days of talking about tokenized markets for carbon offsets, with several presentations on the topic, Trenor asked, exasperatedly, “Why are we still talking about carbon offsets? We need emission reductions, now,” surprising the audience. Over the next few days presenters and attendees would almost defensively say in their speeches that they were thinking about other tokenized assets as well – which wasn’t exactly Trenor’s point.  The noncarbon-obsessed participants seemed happy to be included in the conversation and learn from people who have been part of the movement for years. “It’s been great to be a part of this as someone who is working on a different aspect of sustainability,” said Gjermund Garaba, chief technology officer at Empower, a blockchain platform for tracing plastic collection and recycling.  Towards the end of Day One, Daniel Hwang, formerly with f2pool and stakefish and a leading member of BICOWG, hosted a fireside chat with Benoît Clement, chief of financial innovation at Verra. Clement’s presence at the conference was a big deal – many of these crypto projects have based their existence on the fact that voluntary carbon markets are inadequate and lack transparency.  Hwang asked hardball questions and Clement answered diplomatically. Verra is exploring the potential to collaborate with Web3 projects and has asked for feedback on how to approach third-party tokenization. However, so far “a lot of action has been taken [by crypto projects tokenizing carbon credits] without all the t’s being crossed and i’s being dotted,” he said.  Crypto’s inherent anonymity might be problematic for a marketplace that handles millions of dollars from credited, regulated institutions. “Maybe when there’s hundreds of millions of dollars in money going through a market it’s good to know who that money is coming from” as well as who retires carbon credits, Clement said. Another important question is defining when speculative investment is warranted and good for projects and investors, he pointed out.  Despite the talk of interoperability, some attendees banded together to sign a 12-page statement that the voluntary carbon marketplace should not, in its efforts to accommodate Web3, actually slow down innovation.  Next steps  All that being said, there was a certain insularity to the group and, as a complete outsider normally focused on an industry that many of the attendees find somewhat abhorrent (bitcoin mining), I found it hard to break in. It was my impression that many formed real, human bonds during the three days.  By its own admission, this group is not ready to go public, and the language they use and the narrative they promote needs to be refined for a broader audience. Many of the discussions did feel like the terse echo bubbles that the world dislikes about crypto.  How some of their projects will be taken by the wider world remains to be seen. Their ideas do not at first instance match well with the majority of investors, funds and asset managers. The group seemed ambivalent as to whether it wants to attract the attention and support of the big powers of the world, or whether it wants to work independently of them. Still, some of the attendees are headed to COP27, the United Nations’ biggest climate conference. There, they will talk about their work and ideas to some of the world’s most influential people.

42394106,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXliD,1667492362,"With Hacks at a Record High, Crypto Needs to Find Better Ways to Keep Users Safe","The figures are in: October was the busiest month for crypto protocol exploits this year, with some $760 million stolen. The cumulative total for crypto hacks in 2022 is now at least $2.98 billion, already more than double the amount stolen through exploits in 2021, according to blockchain security firm Peckshield.  Peckshield released those figures on Halloween night, giving credence to the term “Hacktober” some industry participants have taken to using. Not a week has gone by without some exploit in crypto making the news. Peckshield estimated there were at least 44 exploits involving some 53 protocols in October.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  November, too, is already off to a rocky start. Wednesday, Deribit closed customer withdrawals from the derivative exchange so it could patch a bug in its hot wallet that led to a loss of $28 million in bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and stablecoin USDC. Then Solana-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Solend announced a $1 million exploit. Meanwhile, a new Lightning Network bug has been discovered that can cause transactions to fail on the Bitcoin scaling and payments layer.  That some $100 million of funds stolen in October have so far been returned is cold comfort. Crypto has become a den of liars, thieves and exploiters – in a way that has may have permanently stained the industry's reputation. Also of little relief is the fact that crypto, once thought to be the den of illicit dark net behavior, is just a fraction of global crime. That may be because open, verifiable blockchains are bad places to do bad things. But even with just a small percentage of total crypto transactions being tied to criminal behavior, hacks will continue to tarnish the industry's reputation.  Apart from scaring potential participants, hacks have real consequences for how authorities will regulate the industry. The $625 million Ronin bridge exploit in March, the second-most lucrative month in 2022 for hackers, was thought to have been perpetrated by North Korean keyboard warriors and eventually led to the sanctioning of the Ethereum-based crypto mixer Tornado Cash by the U.S. Treasury Department.  Exploits come in all shapes and sizes. Bridges, the communication portals between different blockchains that often require users to park collateral before getting on, seem like particularly vulnerable targets. It’s clear today that crypto needs more resilient infrastructure if the “multi-chain” world will ever become a reality.  Some schemes are exploits of crypto and DeFi’s fundamental design. In 2020, amid the rise of DeFi, the industry saw the rise of the “flash loan” attack. Instead of exploiting buggy code, flash loans are actually a desirable (for some) financial mechanism that allows people to borrow significant amounts of crypto and pay back the loan within a single block – sometimes manipulated so that users can walk away with the money without having paid more than a few transaction fees.  Another increasing area of concern are protocols that use blockchain oracles to feed them real-world data. Last month, a hacker manipulated price feeds to take out a $116 million loan on Mango Markets, draining the protocol’s liquidity. That attack, one of three that occurred on Oct. 12, seems to have been replicated again with Wednesday’s Solend breach.  See also: Calling a Hack an Exploit Minimizes Human Error | Opinion  It’s hard to stop attacks that seem to rely on DeFi’s core functions and promise: permissionless transactions. This is an echo of crypto’s long-running problem with rug pulls, which at one time seemed to be the source of most stolen funds. According to a report by the Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute initially published in early 2022 and recently updated, some 97% of token listings were connected to “malicious” activity.  Experts have criticized that data, which analyzed 27,000 tokens, saying that not every low-effort phishing or pyramid scheme has takers. Some, like Mark Zeller, vice president of the DeFi committee at L'Adan, a French digital asset industry group, said crypto users know the risks when they decide to get involved. That’s likely the case for people who know how to bridge crypto across blockchains or provision liquidity in decentralized money markets.  But that argument is less convincing for crypto platforms like lenders Celsius Network and Voyager Digital which advertised to the masses and had user experiences similar to legitimate banking and trading apps. DeFi, too, is moving to professionalize and polish its on-ramps. Maybe it can clear out the bugs.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION | TRADING | TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/11/03/with-hacks-at-a-record-high-crypto-needs-to-find-better-ways-to-keep-users-safe,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/18034261bd8d42cad14ea1711d5a7f222d61d504-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42413704,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlBsSQ,1667491544,Crypto Exchange Kraken Launches 'Gasless' NFT Marketplace,"Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has launched the beta version of its platform for its non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace, which offers ""gasless"" transactions and an intuitive design. Currently the marketplace is only open to customers who joined the waitlist in May, 2022.  Kraken NFT touts itself as ""the complete solution for exploring, curating and securing your NFT collection."" The launch includes a curated offering of 70 top-selling NFTs on the Ethereum and Solana blockchains.  According to the site, transactions will be ""gasless,"" meaning that users can buy and sell NFTs that are custodied within the Kraken ecosystem without incurring blockchain network fees. ""This means clients can trade on the marketplace with zero disruption, even in peak network activity,"" Kraken said in a press release.  The new marketplace will also feature an NFT aggregator, which allows users to view and purchase NFTs listed on other marketplaces; ""creator rewards"" paid back to original content creators after each secondary market sale so that they are ""always properly compensated for their time and efforts;"" rarity scores for all supported NFT collections; and the option to trade NFTs using over 200 cryptocurrencies and eight fiat currencies.  As more NFT marketplaces shift toward optional royalty models, Kraken told CoinDesk that it is ""committed to creating an environment that is balanced and fair to both creators and collectors.""  ""As of today, we collect royalties on behalf of creators and distribute them once a collection's creator has been verified. The exact percentage varies by collection. However, our thinking on this may – and should – evolve as solutions that better serve the NFT community are developed.""  Kraken said that it plans to open up the beta to the public ""soon after"" launching its initial beta test with waitlist signees. It added that its decision to launch an NFT marketplace highlights its belief that NFTs are ""more than a speculative asset.""  ""Our focus is to ensure clients experience a premium and secure service; we're not in the business of timing markets, but in accelerating financial freedom and independence,"" Kraken told CoinDesk.  Kraken joins a growing number of NFT marketplaces that are integrating new tools like aggregators and rarity trackers onto their platforms to remain competitive. Last month, Rarible launched its Rarible 2 update, which incorporated new aggregation tools, while Paradigm-backed NFT marketplace Blur launched with ""professional"" trading features like “floor sweeping” across multiple marketplaces, reveal “sniping” and portfolio analytics tools.

That prompted a 60% price surge in AR, the Web3 platform’s native token, boosting AR's market cap to $838 million and making it the third-largest Web3 token worldwide. The effect rippled through the metaverse: The tokens of Web3 platforms Filecoin and Storj gained 10% and 25%, respectively.  Crypto exchange Huobi Global, one of the largest crypto platforms in Asia, appeared to confirm it plans to move to the Caribbean by retweeting a post by Justin Sun, founder of the Tron blockchain network and an adviser to the company. The exchange, which was founded in China in 2013, is now based in the Seychelles.  On paper, billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried’s cryptocurrency empire is split into two parts: FTX, his exchange, and Alameda Research, his trading firm – both giants in their respective industries. However, a private financial document shows Alameda’s balance sheet includes billions of dollars in FTT, the native token of FTX, blurring the line between the two companies.     Chart of the Day: The Layer 2 Surge  Adoption of layer 2 blockchains, led by Ethereum, has recently soared, with the number of transactions processed by these platforms reaching a record high of 5.78 million.  The data from Orbiter.Finance, shown above, measures the number of transactions processed by layer 2 networks over the past 12 months.

Stablecoin Exchange Inflow Mean Has Surged Up To A New ATH Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, these inflows can be positive for Bitcoin in the long term, but might be bearish in the short term. The &apos;stablecoin exchange inflow mean&apos; is an indicator that measures the average amount of stablecoins per transaction going into the wallets of centralized exchanges. As stablecoins are relatively stable in value (as their name already implies) due to them being tied to fiat currencies, investors in the crypto space use them for escaping the volatility associated with most other coins. Once these holders feel that prices are right to enter back into volatile markets like Bitcoin, they convert their stables into them using exchanges. Because of this, a large number of these coins moving into exchanges can provide buying pressure for the volatile cryptos, and hence surge up their prices. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the stablecoin exchange inflow mean, as well as the corresponding Bitcoin prices, over the last couple of years: The value of the metric seems to have been pretty high in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the stablecoin exchange inflow mean has observed some sharp uptrend in recent weeks...",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/stablecoin-exchange-inflow-ath-bullish-bitcoin/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/3687940.jpeg

The product will support collections on Ethereum, as well as rollup chains including Arbitrum, Optimism and Polygon.  Spearmint implements an “allow list” feature that helps creators vet the individuals who sign up to mint tokens in an artist’s collection. Product Manager Mike Garland told CoinDesk that this model will keep out bad actors who worsen the communities that creators have built around their collections.  “Spearmint can help you focus your collection on the folks who have genuine interest in what you're building, rather than just trying to flip and make a quick buck,” Garland said in the interview.  Jay Paik, lead engineer at Alchemy, told CoinDesk that oftentimes, manually creating these lists can be work-intensive, thus providing the infrastructure to automate these rosters can help developers focus their attention on building out their NFT project.  Alchemy has been building out its suite of products to support developers in the past year. After earmarking $25 million to support Web3 developers in June, it acquired Web3 educational platform ChainShot in August to provide resources for builders to learn more about blockchain technology.

42413702,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlBsQY,1667490853,"‘Hyperbitcoinization’ Is a Few Years Away, Predicts Samson Mow","Eurozone and U.K. inflation rates are at record, double-digit highs, prompting some governments to begin warming up to bitcoin. One evangelist is meeting with officials to accelerate the process.  Most people already know El Salvador made bitcoin legal tender in September of last year. The Central African Republic followed suit this past April. But less publicized is that some elected officials in places like the U.K. and Portugal are increasingly taking a shine to bitcoin.  Samson Mow spent half a decade as chief strategy officer of Blockstream, the blockchain infrastructure company started by Bitcoin pioneer Adam Back. It was there that Mow advised El Salvador President Nayib Bukele on the country’s $1 billion bond backed by bitcoin.  Now, Mow is CEO of Bitcoin technology startup Jan3 (the Bitcoin blockchain launched on Jan. 3, 2009), and he has made it his mission to educate other governments on Bitcoin.  Based on conversations he has had with politicians, Mow said “hyperbitcoinization” – or the point where Bitcoin becomes the world’s dominant monetary system – is only a few years away.  “If your criteria [for hypberbitcoinization] is every country in the world, it might take 20 or 30 years. But if you're talking about a good number of countries; let's say North America, Europe and a number of countries in Latin America and Africa, I think it's definitely possible around 2030,” Mow told CoinDesk in an interview.  Read more: Ex-Blockstream Exec Samson Mow Raises $21M for Bitcoin Startup JAN3  Global South meets Global North  Typically, countries in Africa, Asia, Oceania, Latin America and the Caribbean – the Global South – are the ones prone to debilitating socio-economic woes including political instability and hyperinflation. These conditions often make Global South citizens significantly more receptive to Bitcoin and its native currency.  “If you're born in the Global South, where you've seen rapid inflation or your parents have seen rapid inflation or hyperinflation where your currency can massively devalue and you're going to need a wheelbarrow to truck it around, then you get Bitcoin much quicker,” Mow said. “You just have an easier route to understanding Bitcoin versus someone born in Canada or the U.S. But things are changing.”  Mow, a Canadian, explained how some conditions in the Global North (North America, Europe and Australasia) seem to be converging with conditions in the Global South. Canada narrowly escaped double-digit inflation this past summer, but America’s northern neighbor made headlines earlier in the year when the Canadian government told banks to freeze accounts belonging to citizens who donated to the Canadian trucker protests.  Read more: Vitalik Buterin Calls Canada's Use of Banks to Stifle Protestors 'Dangerous'  “If you're a protester and you disagree with the government’s stance on something, your bank account can be frozen for lawful behavior. So that should really drive people to move to bitcoin, move to self-sovereign money that someone else cannot just turn off,” said Mow.  Meanwhile, other political leaders are pushing for a more libertarian approach to governance and Mow is knocking on their doors. He said he had an intriguing fireside chat with U.K. Member of Parliament Lisa Cameron at the U.K. Bitcoin Conference last week, for example.  More substantially, Mow has developed a relationship with Miguel Albuquerque, president of Madeira, a Portuguese autonomous region off the coast of North Africa that is becoming known as the “Bitcoin Beach of Portugal.” President Albuquerque has openly embraced bitcoin, so much so there were erroneous reports that Madeira had declared bitcoin its legal tender. Mow now sits on the board of the Regional Forum of Economic Education (Forum Regional Educação Econômica – F.R.E.E. Madeira), an initiative designed to make Madeira a global technological hub, with an emphasis on bitcoin.  Mow said he’s also working with Prospera, a special economic zone in Honduras that made bitcoin legal tender.  “It's effectively a free, private city,” Mow explained of Prospera. “They're on the island of Roatan.”  Closer to the U.S., Mow said, “We’re engaged with Senator Indira Kempis. She's pushing for bitcoin adoption in Mexico.”  It seems the list of governments embracing bitcoin or interested in making it legal tender is not only growing but becoming more diverse, especially as jurisdictions in both the Global North and South become better educated on the topic.  “It's all about education,” Mow explained. “We were trying to get some meetings in South Korea a few months back, but the climate was not great because of Terra’s collapse. There's still a great deal of conflation between bitcoin and crypto. That's another area we're working to educate people on, which is, bitcoin is not crypto. There's bitcoin, there's crypto and then there are stablecoins, three distinct categories.”  There’s also a fourth category – central bank digital currencies (CBDC). These are simply digital currencies issued by a country’s central bank. Many governments from both sides of the north-south divide have already launched projects to implement CBDCs into their monetary systems. However, Mow is skeptical.  Read more: China's CBDC Transactions Reach $14B as Uptake Slows: Report  “The problem is governments are really bad at thinking about system design,” he warned. “Either it's going to take 20 or 30 years for a proper transition, or it's just going to fall flat. CBDCs are just conceptualized and theory-crafted in a complete vacuum. They'll never function properly.

White's comments come after Iris earlier this week said some of its mining equipment – owned by special-purpose vehicles – isn't producing enough cash to meet financing obligations. Additionally, Iris said that the equipment has a market value ""well below the principal amount of the relevant loans"" and that it is in talks with the lender.  White thinks negotiations may aid the company's financial position.  “Given the depressed pricing for mining rigs in the market (recent pricing has been in the $15/TH range for similar machines), we believe the smartest choice for the lenders is to voluntarily restructure the debt to reduce monthly debt service payments, for instance, by extending the maturity of the loans,” White wrote, referring to terahash, a measure of computing power.  “Otherwise, because there is no recourse to IREN, the company can just send the rigs back to the lenders and use its enhanced liquidity position to purchase new machines at a lower implied price, making the transaction net accretive,” he added.  Compass Point rates the stock at buy with a $8.50 price target. The shares were recently down 6% to $2.70.

42413712,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlBsZu,1667480400,"Bitcoin Bear Market Has a Silver Lining, CryptoCompare's Q3 Review Shows","Bitcoin (BTC) has plunged 70% in value since hitting a peak of $69,000 in November of last year.  The ongoing bear market may appear more brutal than previous ones considering several industry heavyweights like Terra, Three Arrows Capital and Celsius Network have buckled under the weight of the market crash. Yet, there is a silver lining.  According to data provider CryptoCompare, both small and large investors have consistently bought the cryptocurrency on the dips, contradicting the continued selling seen during previous bear markets dated November 2013 to December 2014 and December 2017 to December 2018. Both bear markets saw bitcoin plunge more than 80% from record highs.  ""As opposed to the last bear market, where all holders across different wallet sizes were panic-selling, in this bear market we have seen a consistent accumulation in almost all accounts,"" CryptoCompare's quarterly report released on Thursday said.  ""Accounts above 10,000 bitcoins have seen a fair increase which is likely due to increased institutional adoption,"" CryptoCompare added.  Per data sourced from blockchain analytics firm Santiment, nine new addresses owning 10,000 BTC to 100,000 BTC have been created since Sept. 20. These addresses have snapped up 190,000 BTC (worth $3.8 billion) in seven weeks.  Investors and analysts widely use wallets or address-based metrics to gauge changes in demand and supply. On-chain data has its limitations and inferring definite conclusions about market activity from the same is challenging. For example, a user/exchange can control multiple addresses. In other words, every new address does not represent a new investor. Crypto exchanges often hold user coins in multiple addresses.  Volatility subsides  Another positive takeaway from the latest market swoon is the decline in bitcoin's volatility.  The annualized realized volatility has averaged 63% in the past 12 months. That's lower than the average of 79% seen during the previous bear market, according to CryptoCompare.  Realized volatility measuresdaily changes in the price of a security over a particular period of time. Its backward-looking and different from implied volatility, an options market gauge representing traders' expectations for price turbulence in coming days, weeks, or months.  If that's not enough, bitcoin's 20-day realized volatility recently matched Wall Street's tech-heavy index Nasdaq, the first such instance since 2020, per data sourced from charting platform TradingView.  Skeptics have long criticized bitcoin for being too volatile to be a good store of value. So, a continued decline in price turbulence would be a welcome development.  ""Bitcoin's volatility has been steadily stabilizing in a bounded range compared to the last bear market. While this may suggest cryptocurrencies are maturing as an asset class, such patterns also typically precede a large spike in volatility – such as in November 2017,"" CryptoCompare noted.

Aptos Labs, the company behind Aptos, was co-founded by Mo Shaikh and Avery Ching, former Meta employees who helped create the tech giant’s failed stablecoin known as diem. The high-profile layer 1 blockchain raised $200 million in a March funding round led by noted investment firm Andreesen Horowitz and then raised another $150 million in a July round led by FTX Ventures and Jump Crypto. However, the mainnet debut last month was shaky, with initially slow transaction times and a limited ecosystem as dozens of projects were still waiting to launch.  Blocto was founded in Taipei in 2019 by parent company portto and offers a wallet application and ecosystem that aims to make it easier for new users to enter the Web3 space through features such as email logins and universal gas or transaction fees. Blocto, which has raised $8.8 million in funding, according to Crunchbase, also supports the Ethereum, Solana, Flow, BNB Chain, Polygon and Tron blockchains.  ""We've been on the lookout for promising blockchain ecosystems with long-term potential, and Aptos has caught our attention,” said Blocto co-founder and CEO Hsuan Lee in the press release. “It aims to make blockchain accessible for average users – a big focus for us at Blocto – and has accumulated a lot of momentum in the dev community, even in the current market situation.""

42413713,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlBsaq,1667480400,SuperRare NFT Marketplace Launches RarePass for Exclusive Curated Art Drops,"SuperRare, an Ethereum-based, decentralized digital art marketplace, is looking to shake up the way art is collected through the launch of its “Genesis” RarePass.  Holders of the RarePass, which SuperRare Labs Chief Operating Officer Kyle Olney compares to a subscription-like service, will receive curated crypto art by some of the most prominent artists on the platform, all within a single transaction.  “The goal is for this [RarePass] to be a trusted, curated pass offering,” Zack Yanger, senior vice president of art advisory at SuperRare Labs, told CoinDesk.  Read more: SuperRare NFT Market: A Beginner’s Guide  Over one year, RarePass holders will receive an airdrop once a month into their crypto wallet from 12 non-fungible token (NFT) artists, including XCOPY, Pindar Van Arman, Other World, Coldie and others.  Each artist will create a series of 250 unique pieces of art for corresponding RarePass holders. The collections are intended to reflect the beginning of a new era for each of these artists, according to Olney.  Pindar Van Arman, an AI artist with over 20 years of experience, has been with SuperRare since its inception in 2018. He told CoinDesk that the idea of collecting art via a series of digitally-exclusive airdrops is something “that hasn't been done before.”  The new pass provides a curated list of artists with an edge and gets their work seen by a wider audience, he added.  Olney told CoinDesk that the participating artists were chosen by its curation team. Although the platform initially considered having community input from the SuperRare DAO, the platform decided that “for something like this that’s the first go out of the gate … we felt like being pretty careful about how we control this,” Olney said.  In an effort to gamify the art collecting experience, an additional three artworks by 12 other artists will be distributed randomly to select pass holders on a monthly basis, totaling to 24 artists.  A 24-hour auction for the first RarePass will begin on Nov. 15 without a set floor price.  “We don’t want SuperRare to just arbitrarily come up with a number of what we think it’s worth,” Yanger said. “We really want the community to decide the pricing of the pass.”  The team also hinted at future passes for thematic collections, pending the success of the initial launch.  Boosting the crypto art market  As interest in the NFT market has cooled off with the broader crypto market, marketplaces are finding creative ways to entice new buyers and reward creators.  So far, SuperRare has transacted upwards of $280 million in sales, with more than half – $165 million – being earned by the platform’s artists through royalties, including $10 million in secondary sale royalties.  “That’s actually the innovation of NFTs,” Onley said. “It has gotten lost in the last couple of years when everybody became really engaged in numbers going up and speculative trading.”  On SuperRare, monthly crypto art volume hit a peak of $37 million in October 2021, compared to just over $4 million in October 2022. Now, the marketplace is looking to salvage lost ground with its innovative airdrop.  “A lot of the offerings that came out last year … were way overhyped and completely underdelivered,” Yanger said, adding that SuperRare’s Genesis collection looks to live up to its promises and give RarePass holders “actual access to artists that created this space with a single transaction.”",POSITIVE,없음,MARKET | MINING | REGULATION | AIRDROP,"Fran Velasquez, Doreen Wang",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2022/11/03/superrare-launches-rarepass-for-exclusive-curated-art-drops,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/afbb3d655618dd69aecd79c53a9021e740c81936-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Hands On Web3 will take place about a week after the U.S. midterm elections, where 435 House seats and 35 Senate seats are up for a vote, potentially changing the landscape of Congress and crypto regulation efforts.  “I frequently liken it to asking someone to design an umbrella when they've never even seen the rain,” Paradigm Chief Legal Officer Katie Biber told CoinDesk in an interview. “What we're trying to do is change that – to experience crypto is to understand crypto.”  To be held in Washington, D.C.'s Union Station, Hands On Web3 will be tailored toward policymakers, academics and the media. The event will include demonstrations from non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea, crypto exchange FTX and crypto music startup Royal, among others. The demos will include ways for participants to get hands-on experience with crypto transactions like setting up a wallet or joining a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).  “There are some ethical restrictions with some offices that can't own crypto,” said Paradigm U.S. Policy Manager John Heinemann, who previously worked for the House Committee on Financial Services. “That's why every booth is bringing their own device so people can play with it without running afoul of any ethics rules.”  The event will also include “pop-up policy discussions” with former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Georgetown University School of Law's Chris Brummer, Uniswap Labs Chief Operating Officer Mary-Catherine Lader and Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.). The special guests will appear at the event’s reception and will each briefly share their views on topics such as decentralized finance or recent developments with DAO regulations, said Biber, whose work history includes serving as general counsel for digital assets firm Anchorage and the 2012 presidential campaign for Mitt Romney.  “Our internal mantra for this event is that it’s all tech, no politics,"" explained Biber. “This is not an opportunity for lobbying or for cramming legislative ideas down the throats of attendees. It’s purely to allow them to see the technology and the exciting implications that we feel like it has for the world.”  Read more: Previewing Next Week's US Midterm Election  UPDATE (17:23 UTC): Updates quote in final paragraph to correct wording.",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | UNI,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/11/03/venture-capital-firm-paradigm-to-host-crypto-tech-event-on-capitol-hill,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fce6da7a9a0caf2c2b9100fb32c548724c82efb1-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42413699,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlBsOg,1667479951,UK Powers to Regulate Crypto Ads Approved by Lawmaker Committee,"New U.K. laws to restrict crypto ads and outlaw the provision of services by unauthorized operators were passed in a committee of the House of Commons Thursday without opposition or further debate.  The measures, now formally included in the government’s Financial Services and Markets Bill, add to those agreed upon last week by the Bill Committee, despite industry concerns the measure could make it harder to get ads approved.  In April, Rishi Sunak – at the time finance minister, now prime minister – said he wanted to make the country a crypto hub, and the government has pressed on with its regulatory agenda despite political turbulence that saw first Boris Johnson and then Liz Truss stepping down as leader.  On Oct. 25, minister Andrew Griffith told lawmakers the measure gave him the powers for “regulating a broader set of crypto activities beyond stablecoins,” citing “activities relating to the trading and investment of crypto assets such as bitcoin and [ether].”  The original draft of the bill focused on the use of stablecoins – a means of payment tied to assets such as the British pound. For reasons of legislative procedure, a vote on the longer part of the proposed government amendments was held over until this week.  The new clause formally approved on Thursday would potentially extend existing rules which prevent the promotion or provision of financial services by unauthorized agents – and that power could now cover any cryptographically secured representations of value and rights using means such as Bitcoin-style distributed ledger technology.  Griffith has promised a consultation on exactly how that power should be used before Christmas, and regulator the Financial Conduct Authority has already tentatively set out how it wants to restrict crypto ads.

42411072,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giBW4I,1667479120,What Dance Tells Us About the Uses and Limitations of Art,"The digital squirrels, cyborgs and cowboys on Fortnite danced in 10-second intervals, recalled Jorge Poveda Yanez, a Ph.D. candidate who studies dance at Ghent University in Belgium. He was mesmerized by their rhythmic pulses, by these digital avatars programmed to move in unison: thrusting pelvises, flailing arms, stomping feet. Suddenly it clicked. He had seen this dance before.  Fortnite, the popular multiplayer online game created by Epic Games, is as known today for its dances, called Emotes, as it is for its free-to-play multiverse. But, Yanez suspects, along with other experts and artists, that these moves were likely appropriated from living, breathing dancers – without their consent or compensation.  “They realized their choreographies and their steps were included in the video game and they were not getting any attribution or retribution whatsoever,” Yanez said, referring to artists who say their choreography was stolen. (Emotes are sold online in Fortnite’s marketplace, and have served as the basis for many dance routines on social media apps like TikTok.)  This is, of course, not the first time someone else's artistic work was copied online. In the age of digitization, where information flows freely and crediting creators is often an afterthought, the lines between inspiration and outright theft have blurred. The problem is particularly pervasive in the world of dance due to loopholes in U.S. intellectual property law and the ease of appropriating step routines without attribution.  Read more: NFTs and Intellectual Property: What Do You Actually Own?  Yanez, an artist, lawyer and university professor, is among a growing number who think crypto has a role to play righting the wrongs enabled by platforms like Fortnite. His work with crypto – which includes university lectures and workshops – extends beyond the realm of law and into how digital innovations are changing the way people think about art.  Even if centralized platforms like TikTok and YouTube have issues, they also help people build brands, increase their audiences and distribute their content. Likewise, blockchain-based tools are not perfect solutions but do help people reclaim ownership of their work on the internet.  “It’s undeniable that [crypto] has given artists a renewed sense of agency over their practices,” he said. This is all the more important as the traditional world of dance comes to a crossroads with digital and social media.  Course work  Yanez teaches a course at the University of Ghent called ""Dance and the Blockchain: Commodification and Ownership of Embodied Creativity in the Crypto Space."" He also hosts workshops where he discusses how tools like NFTs can help artists monetize and protect their creations.  In the U.S., the government does not register short dance routines under the Copyright Act – even if they are considered to be “unique.” The provision, enacted in the late 1970s to protect original works of authorship, actually created a massive gap in intellectual property law around dance, Yanez said.  Even today, in order for a dance to be considered a piece of work that qualifies for registration, it must meet guidelines that show how it is presented in “tangible medium[s] of expression,” like video recordings and live performances.  Yanez’s course, which took him two years to complete, presented crypto as a tool to monetize movement in order to make up for the vagaries of the law. For artists, non-fungible tokens (NFT) can be attached to a bit of digital media – from a picture to a video to a song – and used to crowdfund artistic projects or earn money on previously produced works. They also provide new opportunities for fans and artists to engage.  Yanez sees this as a new form of digital ownership, which raises interesting questions for academics, lawyers and his students. NFTs, for instance, could help dancers show they performed a specific routine first given that the information would be tied to immutable blockchains. But this is a method that exists outside the boundaries of intellectual property law, he said.  Read more: Should You Copyright Your NFTs? / Opinion  Alandis Brassel, a media attorney at law firm Scale LLP, echoed Yanez comments about the use of NFTs to help creators. However, “They don’t provide the same protections, which leaves choreographers unable to protect certain elements of their work from unauthorized use.”  That said, there have been experiments to use NFTs as a form of copyright. For instance, Yuga Labs, the company behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club, allows token holders to build businesses around their NFT’s characters. Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capital firm, has also proposed a copyright-like classification system for NFTs.  Brassel, who also works as an assistant professor of music business at the University of Memphis, said there is “certainly room for copyright reform.” He added that the law today should aim to “account for the evolution of dance and the manner in which dance is consumed by the public.”  “The Congress that passed the Copyright Act of 1976 could not have contemplated dances ‘going viral’ on social media or being replicated by video game characters,” Brassel said. “An updated copyright law should reflect dance’s current place in society.”  These concerns were not ignored by Yanez. “Even though we did clarify [an NFT] is not the same as [a copyright], we were thinking about how powerful these alternatives are,” Yanez said. NFTs give people a type of “stewardship” to “decide how their dances are circulated, sold and if they want to commodify them [or] if they don’t.”  Conversations over commoditization  Fourteen infrared cameras hovered overhead at the Art and Science Interaction (ASIL) Laboratory in Ghent, recording Yanez and his students’ movements. The “high tech” effort was an attempt to bring his course into life – capturing the performances of everyone involved.  Over the course of a three-day workshop in August, Yanez led an hour-long panel discussion on the issues covered in his course, hosted seminars and NFT minting workshops, watched “movement demonstrations” and set up virtual reality (VR) installation demos. There was a level of artifice, as there is in any academic environment, Yanez said.  The design of the workshop called attention to one of Yanez’s major themes: the difference between traditional and modern culture. Dance, which only requires a body, is likely one of humanity’s oldest forms of artistic expression. And now that everyone has a smartphone with a camera, Yanez is interested in the line between when normal, everyday life becomes art.  Yanez’s students were particularly interested in discussing the digitization of performance art, which tends to turn experiences into something that can be commoditized. NFTs, here, seem like a potential solution and part of the problem, he said.  Read more: The Balance Between Art and IP Theft in NFT Culture / Opinion  The workshop “allowed people to express their own anxieties, plans and thoughts about blockchain technology,” Yanez said, referring to the feedback he received. Crypto essentially allows anyone to create a market around anything, introducing a type of financialization with which many are uncomfortable.  This issue is particularly acute in contemporary art spaces, where concerns are raised about selling out and authenticity. Even if NFTs can seem like “cash grabs,” Yanez said, “we need to shatter these damaging ideas that artists need to be these bohemian, precarious people who always need to be struggling for money, because that’s working against us.”  Thomas Mack, an attorney at law firm Mack Legal PLLC, put the problem in a more practical way: “[Crypto] enables digital scarcity in a way that was not previously possible, while also allowing creators new revenue streams.” In particular, Mack noted how some NFT platforms enable royalty payments to artists paid every time a token exchanges hands.  If the social media panopticon means that any “cultural practice and expression” can be appropriated or put up for sale, isn’t better that you can set your own price, Yanez suggested.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/11/03/dancing-through-copyright-issues-with-nfts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aeab6e335223bff1a4373029999976eed3151152-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393773,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpAnOb,1667478600,Lesson From the US Elections: Don't Mention Crypto,"In 2020, as U.S. presidential candidates squared off, the mob of Democratic hopefuls sought to separate themselves from the pack. As part of his bold campaign for fixing imbalances in the economy, Andrew Yang didn’t shy away from predicting cryptocurrencies may have a useful role.  He joked at a recent event in Washington, D.C., that his campaign staff pleaded with him to stop talking about crypto.  “My team didn't want me hammering that message in mainstream press appearances,” he told CoinDesk in an interview. His people wanted him to stick to another message, Yang said. But the U.S. electorate hasn’t generally clamored to send cutting-edge tech leaders to Washington, and his presidential campaign collapsed quickly.  This year, crypto hasn’t apparently fared any better as a political topic in midterm congressional campaigns approaching the Nov. 8 general election. A remarkable few candidates have been willing to say anything at all about digital assets in public, though plenty have assured the industry privately about what they’d do for crypto and that their campaigns are worth supporting financially.  Michelle Bond, CEO of the Association for Digital Asset Markets, which lobbies on behalf of crypto businesses in Washington, was among the rare cryptocurrency advocates who ran for Congress this year, and she quickly learned that crypto carried some political toxicity.  “Crypto was not a welcome topic on the campaign trail, from the opponents I was running against, and also from the voters,” Bond, who sought the Republican nomination for a New York seat, said in an interview. She didn’t make crypto a significant point in her campaigning, but she didn’t have to, she said, because she carried that label whether she wanted to or not. “I was called the crypto queen.”  She received 6491 votes, compared with the 11,398 won by the eventual Republican candidate. Elsewhere, Bruce Fenton, an early Bitcoin investor and advocate, sought the Republican nod for a seat in New Hampshire, but he drew only 4.4% of the vote in that primary. And in Oregon, Matt West, a decentralized finance (DeFi) developer, came in sixth in his Democratic primary, snaring 8%.  There was a lot of crypto distrust among voters who didn’t know much about the industry, Bond said, arguing that lobbyists have been doing a good job educating policymakers but haven’t yet reached the broader public.  “Crypto needs to do a much better job in the mainstream media,” she said, though the mainstream press has devoted plenty of attention in recent months to the dramatic collapse of several prominent firms, sunken token prices and endless hacker thefts. “We need to make advancements beyond, and we need to start touching those voters.”  Crypto has a demographic. Those drawn to digital assets are most often men, and they’re most likely to be under 30, according to Pew Research Center data (and overwhelming bro-culture evidence). Young men are not big voters in the U.S., statistically. So when a politician starts going on about crypto, campaign advisers know they’re not likely to win a lot of votes with it, and they may risk alienating older folks who may be uneasy about this financial movement.  About one in eight people in the U.S. currently hold crypto, according to a recent poll from the Crypto Council for Innovation. More than half of the 1,200 voters surveyed online – 52% – said they want more regulation for the crypto industry, while just 7% favored less oversight. So they favor the government being engaged, but they also indicated they’d be much less likely to vote for a candidate who supports cryptocurrencies.  In another poll released this week, 37% of those surveyed said they’d consider a candidate’s views on crypto before casting their vote.  Like Bond, another House candidate in Illinois, Jonathan Jackson – a businessman, professor and the son of the Rev. Jesse Jackson – also learned crypto support comes with a price. He drew political attacks for benefiting from hundreds of thousands of dollars that crypto industry sources spent on ads for his campaign. The money was deployed as “independent expenditures,” which is a way corporate sources or wealthy benefactors can pile unlimited cash into a campaign, so Jackson argued he had no choice about accepting the help.  “By definition, an independent expenditure is just that, independent,” he told Chicago-area media in a statement. “We did not seek it, and we cannot control it.”  Still, his campaign website is one of the few in the nation that openly touts the benefits of crypto, and since he claimed a decisive victory in his Democratic primary, he’s expected to win in the general election next week and join Congress next year.  The crypto industry itself is well aware that it’s not going to win a lot of votes for its favored candidates. So when its political action committees (PAC) buy TV ads or mailers for candidates, the issues they highlight aren’t typically about crypto at all. They often focus on topics that are specifically important to the district or state their candidate is running in, so a viewer would hardly guess an ad was paid for by a crypto PAC if not for the small-print disclosures they may spot.  The so-called crypto winter has strangled most feel-good stories about regular people gaining wealth in the new markets. Instead, many voters are likely to know somebody who has been having a tough time recently with crypto. That further suppresses candidates’ ability to make friends through digital-assets conversations.  “It's not like anyone is rah, rah, rah, crypto right now,” said Bond, whose “crypto queen” label didn’t seem to help the political novice’s second-place outcome in the primaries, despite Crypto Innovation PAC spending more than $1 million dollars in advertising to support her.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/03/lesson-from-the-us-elections-dont-mention-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b96834d56aed8c8d3476f59d1579647094db43e-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411069,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giBVr4,1667475000,Vitalik Buterin's 'Proof of Stake': The CoinDesk Megareview,"While he’s best known as the co-creator of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin began his cryptocurrency journey in a role that often gets a bit less respect: journalist.  Driven by his interest in Bitcoin, Buterin was a co-founder of and incredibly prolific contributor to Bitcoin Magazine starting way back in 2012. His writing about Bitcoin helped him deeply engage with the theory behind crypto, and formed connections to early projects like MasterCoin that shaped his ideas for Ethereum.  Even after stepping back from journalism, Buterin has continued to guide thinking in the cryptocurrency world through blog posts on an array of topics. Now a selection of Buterin’s posts and related writing have been assembled in a proper book, “Proof of Stake: Making Ethereum and the Philosophy of Blockchains,” released Sept. 27 from Seven Stories Press.  Curated and edited by University of Colorado Boulder media studies professor Nathan Schneider, the volume features important documents of the early days of Ethereum, but focuses largely on Buterin’s big-picture takes on deep questions about markets, money and society.  The maturity and nuance of these essays makes them inherently interesting regardless of authorship. But they are important for two added reasons. First, reading essays stretching back as far as 2014 shows just how profoundly Buterin has shaped thinking about crypto: Many concepts and lines of reasoning that are now part of the fabric of crypto theory got their first or most prominent airing in Buterin’s writing.  Second, the body of work in “Proof of Stake” demonstrates the sheer depth and complexity of thought that goes into designing economic and technical systems that are both innovative and sustainable. You might even argue that the intellectual foundations Buterin forged through writing have played a major role in the long-term success of Ethereum. Luna founder Do Kwon, to draw a particularly pointed contrast, is not exactly known for his care with words, a lack that might have been reflected in the nuance, or lack thereof, in Kwon’s wealth-annihilating creation.  See also: Vitalik Buterin Warns of 'Pursuing Large Institutional Capital At Full Speed'  Here are the key takeaways from the collection, according to staffers from Layer 2 – starting with Buterin’s rarely appreciated lighter side.  – David Z. Morris  Vitalik, the low-key cut-up: 7 zingers from ‘Proof of Stake’  Reading “Proof of Stake” reminded me of meeting its author, Vitalik Buterin, in 2014. It was hard to keep up with his train of thought, but he still managed to seem upbeat and open. While abstract and often technical, Buterin’s collected writing comes off as similarly personable – in no small part due to a wry sense of humor. In fact, Buterin often uses jokes to convey important ideas.  The Ethereum creator’s witticisms range from dark comedy to inside baseball to low-key trolling. In a 2016 post describing commonalities between the crypto community and existential-risk researchers, Buterin defines the latter group’s fears this way: “[I]f you tried to tell a superintelligent AI [artificial intelligence] to cure cancer, it may end up reasoning that the most reliable way to do that is to simply kill everyone first. If you tried to plug that hole, it may decide to permanently cryogenically freeze all humans without killing them.”  A notable difference between those two communities, Buterin writes, is that unlike the “Age of Ultron”-style AI that “X-Risk” scholars worry will wipe out humanity, in blockchains “the algorithms are dumb, and yet the agents that they have to control are quite smart. AI safety is about agents with IQ 150 trying to control agents with IQ 6,000, whereas cryptoeconomics is about agents with IQ 5 trying to control agents with IQ 150.”  Buterin takes a few sly digs at the Bitcoin community he belonged to as a teenager before leaving to start Ethereum. In a 2017 post about blockchain governance, he defines the “bottom layer” of the stack, the “ultimate deciding layer,” as users’ ability to run whatever software they want, regardless of external decisions or pressures. This is surely something Bitcoin maximalists would agree with, and why they scoff at, for instance, environmentalists’ campaign to impose code changes from the top down.  But to illustrate the idea, Buterin tweaks maxis’ noses with a scenario straight out of their worst nightmares: “[A]ll Bitcoin users wake up one day and decide to edit their clients’ source code and replace the entire code with an Ethereum client that listens to balances of a particular ERC20 token contract, then that means that that ERC-20 token is bitcoin.”  In another 2017 post describing the different ways to gauge how decentralized a network is, Buterin challenges the assumption among many in the Bitcoin community that mining “consists of many small actors that make decisions independently.” Above a photo of a panel of top mining executives taken at the 2015 Scaling Bitcoin event in Hong Kong, he quips: “Can we really say that the uncoordinated-choice model is realistic when 90% of the Bitcoin network’s mining power is well-coordinated enough to show up together at the same conference?”  Cryptocurrency exchanges, which make their money on trading fees, also get a subtle roasting. In his piece about blockchain governance, to illustrate the downsides of coin voting on protocol changes, Buterin imagines exchanges enticing investors to store coins with them so they can control the votes, which he suggests would not be in a network’s best interests. “Exchanges profit from chaos, so their incentives are clearly quite misaligned with users and coin holders,” Buterin writes.  And in a 2021 post that tries to fathom why blockchain-based prediction markets gave Trump a double-digit probability of overturning the 2020 election even after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected his challenge, Buterin offers this zinger: “Those who are experts in electoral politics have a hard time getting into crypto, and crypto has a large presence of not-always-correct forms of contrarianism, especially when it comes to politics.”  These moments of levity take the edge off the otherwise intimidating challenge of exploring Buterin’s labyrinthine head.  – Marc Hochstein  Vitalik on Ethereum, then and now  In his January 2014 essay, “Ethereum: A Next-Generation Cryptocurrency and Decentralized Application Platform,” Vitalik Buterin laid out the various features of Ethereum, a system that then existed only in his mind, and how it differs from Bitcoin.  The essay served as Ethereum’s white paper, and became a model for many others. It explores the potential of smart contracts and how it enables transaction types such as financial contracts, multisignature escrow, savings accounts and even peer-to-peer gambling. In 2014, all of this was theory; in 2022, it’s reality.  See also: 'Hey, Look, It's a Monkey!' Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin Pokes Fun at Ape NFTs  Ethereum has grown into something real people (as many as half a million at last count) use. And it’s likely to continue growing. The problem of scalability – namely, the storage costs, the throughput concerns and the cost of gas to run the Ethereum blockchain – was just a twinkle in Buterin’s eye back in 2014.  Even back then, Buterin realized blockchain scaling would be a community effort. Today, whole teams with names like Optimism, Arbitrum and Polygon are building different approaches to scaling Ethereum, demonstrating the much-desired plurality Buterin talks about in another 2014 post, “On Silos.”  In this essay, Buterin argues that fragmentation in crypto is both inevitable and “the only way this space can reasonably prosper.” He starts with the assumption that people disagree, and it is only through agreeing to disagree that the Ethereum community can establish a “plurality of networks.”  He also argues that the amount of room in the crypto space for projects with different preferences to develop makes a winner-take-all mentality “completely unnecessary and harmful.” That’s crucial to remember today, as fights between blockchain systems rage on.  Fast forward a year to 2015, and Buterin is again writing about the fundamental advantages of distributed systems – this time noting how decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) can develop a type of “superrationality.” With publicly viewable source code, “not only is it the case that the organization will make it obvious to everyone if they start to cheat, it’s not even possible for the organization’s ‘mind’ to cheat.”  If nothing else, this may remind us of how much the concept of a DAO has shifted, specifically in the declining emphasis on the “autonomous” element. In Buterin’s early writing DAOs were something like artificially intelligent businesses managed by a small human team, rather than the collaboration environments they’ve become.  You can have an idea, but you can’t know how it will be applied. But for Buterin’s sake, let there be many ideas and many attempts to put it into practice.  – Sage D. Young  Vitalik on economics and society  On the surface, Ethereum and subsequent smart-contract platforms have a simple and arguably somewhat boring value proposition. Ethereum wants to be like Bitcoin in that it leverages the protection of decentralization and censorship resistance to transcend national boundaries, but adds more complex (mainly financial) functions than Bitcoin can handle.  But there are a number of broader, more sociological concepts that guide the kinds of projects created on Ethereum. “Proof of Stake” in many cases provides the earliest articulation of those concepts.  In the 2014 essay “Markets, Institutions, and Currencies – A New Method of Social Incentivization,” Buterin makes the case for money that can, while functioning as a medium of exchange, also support particular social endeavors and public goods through their “seigniorage,” or the value of the money above what it costs to create.  Buterin highlights an early example of this in Primecoin, which is still operational. Instead of simply searching, as Bitcoin does, for purely random hashes, Primecoin’s mining algorithm searches for prime numbers while minting new coins. People who use or accept Primecoin for transactions are supporting this mathematical quest by funding the hashpower to search for primes.  Primecoin has fallen from the limelight since 2014, but its appearance here highlights another major benefit of reading “Proof of Stake” – an enhanced awareness of just how much experimentation and innovation took place in what now seems like crypto’s ancient history.  The idea of money as social incentivization wasn’t born with Buterin – he draws inspiration from long-running local currencies like Berkshares. But it has been an underlying premise of both the proliferation of ERC-20 tokens around the 2018 initial coin offering (ICO) boom and, more recently, the rise of affinity-based DAOs that issue their own token to help organize around particular causes or goals. The idea of a currency as a form of social organization is still relatively unproven, but it’s a major premise behind Ethereum’s culture.  The “Markets” essay also provides a touchpoint for Buterin’s intellectual evolution over the years documented here. In this early essay, he flatly claims that “Markets, in their pure form, are fully decentralized.” But by 2020, in a piece called “Credible Neutrality as a Guiding Principle,” Buterin’s views on markets had become more complex: in place of the earlier implied Austrian-school or Lockean naturalist view of economics, he acknowledges the importance of governments in enforcing property rights as a precondition of markets.  Buterin also rightly identifies this need for the state as a problem, particularly since governments are so often opaque and so rarely selfless. “Credible neutrality,” the idea that blockchains cannot be seen to favor or disfavor any one entity, has not yet entirely caught on as a crypto narrative, mostly because it’s not nearly as sexy as, say, “digital gold.” But for those thinking long-term about globalization and the fitful decline of nation-states, it may be the most compelling case of all.  Navigating a logistically unified world still riven by political and social tensions demands, as Buterin puts it, that “everyone must be able to see that the mechanism is fair,” whether that’s the mechanism of exchange or communication. The cryptocurrency and blockchain model tick many boxes for credible neutrality, for instance with their use of open-source code.  However, Buterin does presciently warn that simplicity is another requirement for real transparency: as we’ve seen in the recent crypto unwind, even open-source code can be used to hide a fraud if it’s complex enough.  – Ben Schiller  Soulbound creator  The last chapter of Vitalik Buterin’s “Proof of Stake” begins with a thought experiment about “World of Warcraft,” the massive multiplayer online role-playing game Buterin often cites as his motivation for getting involved in the world of crypto. Buterin reportedly played WoW incessantly between 2007 and 2010, until game creators Blizzard “nerfed” one his “beloved warlocks’” powerful spells.  “I cried myself to sleep, and on that day I realized what horrors centralized services can bring,” Buterin wrote (half-seriously) on an about.me page that has seemingly since been scrapped. The experience led him to open-source tech, primarily Bitcoin, which offered a different vision for digitization based on decentralization and immutability.  Unfortunately, Buterin’s blog post about Warlocks is not part of the new book, though there are plenty of other gems. The best parts of “Proof of Stake” concern Ethereum’s practicality – how the second-largest blockchain can actually be used. This stretches from Buterin’s initial thoughts on decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs, – a type of non-state, non-corporate way to manage projects – to “prediction markets,” a long-theorized way of crowdsourcing truth through betting platforms.  Take also Buterin’s earliest writing on Soulbound tokens, which were pitched as sort of curriculum vitae, a way to record all of a person’s achievements. As the name implies, soulbound tokens are unique digital assets held onto for life. This is opposed to non-fungible tokens (NFT), which are also singularly scarce but transferable.  Buterin, perhaps still thinking about his Warlock, writes NFTs and WoW weapons are similar in an important way: they’re digital goods that have value and utility, but can be bought instead of earned. If NFTs and in-game items are often more about “signaling wealth,” Buterin writes, Soulbound tokens reflect the “sacrifice” of time or energy to create them. SBTs cannot be purchased, they can only be earned.  In writing, when Buterin is coining terms or inventing use cases, he’s clarifying the ideas of others. His essay on “decentralized governance,” (or DeGov, to use Buterin’s parlance that never caught on), focuses on live projects that use on-chain voting, and how those situations, often corrupted by perverse incentives and monopolization, can be improved.  There are a few guiding principles that run throughout the book, which seemingly motivate Buterin in everything he builds. The first is that transparency is better than opacity, that public chains are better than private and that communities should always be at the center of what you build.  In an essay on trustlessness, Buterin reflects abstractly on how code can replace companies. He argues there will always be varying levels of trust, even within open, free and decentralized crypto protocols. Likewise, the world will always have companies like Blizzard, that make choices in pursuit of profit that are detrimental to customers.  If there is no way out of trust, crypto, for Buterin, offers an alternative way of establishing it between self-interested actors. With the right design, crypto can make the better choice between getting yours and being prosocial, whatever it is that’s best for the all. Still, no one knows where all of this will lead. Least of all Buterin, who writes that in DAOs a “specific actor” will “behave in a specific way,” even if specific changes “push them to act in some different, unexpected way in the future.”  Throughout his decade-long writing career, an exercise in trying to better understand and improve the thing he loves, Buterin has seen many of the ideas he’s proposed or advocated for put into practice. Take the proof-of-stake algorithm, the namesake of the book, which went live on Ethereum a month or so ago. This one change, which required years of deliberation and testing and refining, immediately cut the blockchain’s significant energy use. For this Buterin should be immensely proud – if only for demonstrating the practical effects crypto has on the world.  In the introduction, Schnieder notes Buterin is forever a journalist, cursed with a keen eye for drama and truth-telling. Twice now, during different peaks of crypto and Ethereum hype (in 2017 and more recently), Buterin has questioned whether the machine he helped build “deserves” the level of attention it had achieved. Things are broken, incentives are misaligned and scams run amok.  See also: Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Praises 'Bitcoin Maximalism' (Maybe)  Or as Buterin put it in the soulbound essay: “A common criticism of the ‘[W]eb3’ space as it exists today is how money-oriented everything is. People celebrate the ownership, and outright waste, of large amounts of wealth, and this limits the appeal and the long-term sustainability of the culture that emerges around these digital collectibles.”  But solutions are possible, economics can be modeled and communities can take root, as Ethereum takes on a life of its own.  – Daniel Kuhn",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,"Marc Hochstein, Daniel Kuhn, David Z.

The body will be called Bharat Web3 Association (BWA), a shift in branding toward Web3 from the earlier Blockchain and Crypto Assets Council (BACC). The word Bharat represents the nation of India.  The BACC was disbanded in July by its parent organization, the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI). That damped the mood of the crypto ecosystem during a crypto market downturn at the same time as stiff new taxes and macroeconomic factors were hurting the industry and its consumers.  India's crypto tax regime was criticized Thursday by Changpeng Zhao, CEO of crypto exchange Binance, during a panel at a fintech conference in Singapore. Zhao said the high level of taxes is ""probably going to kill the industry,"" in the country, Bloomberg reported.  Leading members of the new association involve Polygon, Hike, Coin DCX, CoinSwitch Kuber, Zebpay, and WazirX, making it the most prominent Web3 advocate in India. Some registration and procedural formalities remain, three people familiar with the plan said before the announcement.  The goals of the body include driving awareness about Web3, pushing for technology and innovation, supporting ecosystem partners and outreach to regulators to communicate steps towards consumer protection.  ""Owing to its thriving developer community, entrepreneurial spirit, fast-growing economy, sound digital infrastructure, and deep digital adoption, India is poised to become a leader in the Web3 space,"" said Sandeep Nailwal, a co-founder of Polygon Technology. ""BWA will play a pivotal role in helping India achieve its potential as a global Web3 leader,"" he added.  India is gearing up for its yearlong stint of holding the presidency of the Group of 20 nations starting next month. The ""BWA is committed to working with the Government of India"" to lead a collaborative regulatory framework for digital assets, according to the announcement.

The exchange, founded in China in 2013, is currently based in the Seychelles. Last month, it agreed to be bought by the M&A fund of Hong Kong-based investment company About Capital Management for an undisclosed amount.  Sun, who stepped down as the Tron's CEO to become Grenada's ambassador to the World Trade Organization last year, said in an interview with the Financial Times earlier this week that the Caribbean's ""super-friendly"" crypto stance, use of English and common law-based legal systems, made it an attractive region to set up shop. He added that Dominica, Panama and the Bahamas were the frontrunners.  Dominica may be the most likely destination should Sun's influence come to bear. Last month, Tron entered into an agreement with the Dominican government to issue a national fan token to promote the island's heritage and tourism.  The move would mark the latest instance of a crypto exchange migrating from Asia to the Caribbean in search of a more helpful regulatory environment.

Months prior, FTX won the rights to rename the American Airlines Arena, which houses the NBA's Miami Heat, to the FTX Arena.

Data provided by CryptoQuant shows that Crypto.com has struggled to maintain the spike in activity that the initial sponsorship announcement brought.  At the beginning of November 2021, there were just over 2,000 active addresses for Crypto.com’s Cronos (CRO), its exchange token. Tracking the number of CRO holders is important as it's a good proxy for the number of engaged traders, not those only putting in a few dollars, as exchange token holders get fee discounts on trades.  In the days following the sponsorship announcement, the number of active addresses spiked to almost 10,000.  “The number of active addresses for CRO increased 4.5x after the announcement,” Burak Tamac, a senior researcher at CryptoQuant, told CoinDesk. “There was also a transaction count increase that coincided with the number of active addresses.”  But following that, the number of active addresses sank back to Earth.  News that the exchange was sponsoring the Formula 1, UEFA Champions League, and World Cup didn’t boost active user numbers the same way the L.A. stadium sponsorship did, which led the exchange to look to start canceling its partnerships.  A report from the trade publication Ad Age says that the exchange continues to look for exits from its sponsorship deals while it cuts its headcount.  When asked about the data behind its sponsorship decision, Crypto.com provided a statement via email from Steven Kalifowitz, the firm’s chief marketing officer: “We have more than 50 million users worldwide, and we will continue to invest in our sports partnerships as they play a pivotal role in helping to accelerate the world's adoption of cryptocurrency.""  FTX Follows a Similar Pattern  Some might say that the bump in CRO’s active users is coincidental, as it coincides with 2020’s bull market hysteria.  But Tamac points to FTX’s sponsorship of the Miami Heat Arena and the subsequent jump in FTT token active addresses when the deal was announced in April 2021 — in what was an otherwise boring crypto market, as month-on-month bitcoin only gained about 2% — as proof of a trend.  FTX didn’t respond to a request for comment.  Does this Cohort Continue to Trade?  CryptoQuant’s Tamac said it would be tough to get data on specific cohorts of users just by looking at on-chain data.  At the time, crypto trading apps were making their way into the top charts of the Apple App Store, alongside trading platforms like Robinhood and Webull. This was the meme stock era, after all, and the action was on mobile.  Data from mobile app insights firm Data.ai (formerly App Annie) shows that Crypto.com’s app didn’t have sustained interest.  Data.ai’s Head of Insights Lexi Sydow pointed to a 122% month-over-month increase in mobile app downloads in October 2021 and another 67% month-over-month increase in November 2021 as proof that the sponsorship deal “caught the attention of consumers.”  But, like the active user count of the CRO and FTT tokens, both quickly fell.  “Crypto sports sponsorships are useful to gain the attention of retail users during a bull market, when crypto prices are rising,” adds CoinGecko’s Ong.  “Crypto exchanges were in a rush to ink such brand sponsorships to be top of mind and the first brand that retail users sign up when searching for a crypto exchange.”  Binance Shied Away From High-Profile Sponsorships  Binance, by far, is the world’s largest crypto exchange, dominating its rivals by a large margin. Its CEO, Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao, is worth nearly $100 billion (excluding crypto holdings), and the company is known to be cash rich.  So the exchange might be a perfect candidate for high-profile sponsorships, but CZ has said no.  While Binance has sponsored some Brazillian soccer teams and the African Cup of Nations tournament, both are fairly low profile in comparison to what others have sponsored with the $2.4 billion price tag.  “It was not easy saying no to Super Bowl ads, stadium naming rights, and large sponsor deals a few months ago, but we did,” CZ tweeted in June, at the depths of this year’s crypto crash, highlighting that Binance was hiring for 2,000 positions.  If there’s any consolation for Crypto.com, it might be found in its mobile app ranking.  While the crypto winter has forced most crypto apps from the top-ranking lists of app stores, Crypto.com’s app ranks as the #47 most-downloaded mobile phone app for September 2022, while Binance is #61 (just behind TradFi’s SoFi, which also sponsored a stadium).  All this as Binance pushes around $5 billion in spot volume per day, according to CoinGecko, while Crypto.com does $233 million.  Perhaps stadium sponsorship does have an effect, though ever so small.",NEUTRAL,CRO,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB | CRO,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/11/03/did-sponsoring-stadiums-bring-new-crypto-traders-or-tourists,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/689527b3384a192348dfbec7a8e651572799b334-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The cryptocurrency has jumped more than 60% from $10.50 to $16.60 in the past 24 hours, according to data source Messari. The rally has boosted the cryptocurrency's market cap to $838 million, making it the third-largest Web3 token worldwide.  Stephane Kasriel, head of commerce and financial technologies at Meta, disclosed the Arweave integration on Twitter late Thursday.  The integration means Instagram users can now issue digital collectibles for their posts, stored on Arweave, the Web3 platform's CEO and co-founder Sam Williams tweeted.  In other words, Meta is bringing data permanency to its platform with the help of decentralized storage technology. It's no surprise that native tokens of other Web 3 data storage platforms like Filecoin and Storj have gained 10% and 25%, respectively.  Arweave allows users to retain information forever. The data, once entered, cannot be altered. Users need to purchase the storage space by paying the AR token.

Under the project, the bank will also explore how systems based on distributed ledger technology (DLT) could interact with non-ledger payment systems.  While central banks around the world are looking into digital iterations of local sovereign currencies for use by citizens in daily transactions, progress on wholesale CBDCs – that can be built on technologies similar to DLT that underlie crypto and be used exclusively between financial institutions to conduct speedy settlements – has been moving faster, propelled by support from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), which includes the world's central banks.  Project Mariana, the measure aimed at foreign exchange and liquidity management, involves MAS, the central banks of Switzerland and France, along with BIS Innovation Hub centers. The project will explore foreign exchange transactions with the Swiss franc, euro and Singapore dollar.  The announcement comes a day after MAS, the central bank of Singapore, started two new projects for trade finance and wealth management products.

Dapper Labs, which created the NFT marketplace NBA Top Shot, is laying off 22% of its staff, citing the ""macroeconomic environment.""  ""These reductions are the last thing we want to do, but they are necessary for the long-term health of our business and communities. We know Web3 and crypto is the future across a multitude of industries – with 1000x potential from here in terms of mainstream adoption and impact – but today’s macroeconomic environment means we aren’t in full control of the timing,"" Dapper Labs Founder and CEO Roham Gharegozlou wrote in a blog post.  Gharegozlou wrote that the firm grew too fast, which prevented it from being ""as aligned, nimble and community-driven as we need to be.""  ""The refocusing of our organization will let us achieve every milestone sustainably: Web3-native, mobile-first, and community-driven,"" Gharegozlou wrote.  At the same time, on-chain data shows that market interest in Dapper Labs' products is declining, following a broader trend of investors shying away from NFTs. On NBA Top Shot, October sales volume came in at $2.6 million, down from $40.8 million during the same time last year. During the height of NFT mania, the NBA Top Shot marketplace generated $224 million worth of NFT trades in February 2021 across 80,822 unique buyers and 1.2 million transactions.  It's a similar story for its recently launched NFL All Day collectibles market, which posted a volume of $6 million in October, down from $14 million a month prior.  Dapper Labs' layoffs are just the latest in a wide range of headcount reductions across the industry. In recent weeks firms like BitMEX, Digital Currency Group (DCG) and NYDIG have all trimmed headcount in order to weather the bear market.

This bullish volatile break propelled Shiba towards its high liquidity zone at the Point of Control (POC) in the $0.00001204-area.
