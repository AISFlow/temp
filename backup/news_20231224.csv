However, in comparison with other major assets, ETH performance still leaves more to desire, especially considering the many positive developments experienced by the asset in 2023. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Struggles While Bitcoin Jumps – Why ETH Could Take Major Hit Ethereum Underperforms Ethereum (ETH) has been one of the major headliners in the crypto space in 2023. The second-largest cryptocurrency and the most prominent altcoin has continued to retain investor interest marked due to several factors. One of these factors is the Shanghai/Capella upgrade in April which has so far produced a significant increase in ETH staking activity as investors are now allowed to freely withdraw their assets from the Ethereum network. Ethereum grew ~85% in market cap in 2023, slightly underperforming other major assets despite upgrades, ETF applications and showing robust adoption metrics. pic.twitter.com/cdvV085cxz — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) December 23, 2023 Furthermore, Ethereum has also recorded an increase in institutional adoption amidst the launch of Ether Futures ETF in the US and a growing competition among several asset managers to gain approval for the first-ever spot Ether ETF. Nevertheless, these developments could only boost the altcoin market shares by 85%, which while impressive, is overshadowed by the performance of other cryptocurrencies. For context, Bitcoin, the market leader, recorded a 163% gain in market cap value, while other top coins, such as ADA and AVAX, also experienced gains to the tune of 145% and 341%, respectively. Trending meme token Bonk (BONK) produced the largest market cap increase of 1,574%, followed by Optimism (OP) with 916% and Solana (SOL) with 744%. Other notable mentions include Celestia (TIA) and Chainlink (LINK), with 459% and 199%, respectively. Related Reading: Ethereum Exchange Balances Drop Drastically, What This Means For ETH Price ETH Price Prediction At the time of writing, Ethereum trades around $2,292.13 with a 0.04% gain on the last day. Looking at the token’s daily chart, ETH is currently headed for the $2,400 resistance zone, which has proven effective in recent weeks. Interestingly, price prediction site Coincodex reports that investor sentiment surrounding Ethereum is strongly bullish, with a Fear & Greed Index of 71. This indicates that many investors currently consider altcoin to be a favorable investment. However, if the $2400 resistance zone holds strong again, ETH could experience a price dip, finding support around the $2120 price region. And in the presence of overwhelming selling pressure, Ethereum could fall as low as $1,921.

The crypto has increased by 74% this year, following the general bullish sentiment among cryptocurrencies. XRP went on a noticeable price spike in the middle of the year, although the price increase is currently calm and the cryptocurrency appears to be going through a consolidation phase. According to a recent analysis by Bard, Google’s AI, XRP’s price trajectory in 2024 is a positive one. Bard noted the various parameters, timeframes, and threats that may influence the trajectory of the cryptocurrency and projected that it might eventually hit the $1, $3, and $5 price points, representing 62%, 380%, and 710% from the current price point. Related Reading: Solana Surges Above $117 As Meme Coin Craze Extends Market Momentum Bard Makes XRP Prediction Google’s AI has predicted that XRP, the native currency of the Ripple network, could hit $1 very soon and $5 in the coming years. At the time of writing, the crypto is trading at $0.6144, making the $1 price target very doable in the coming months. Ripple is one of the biggest drivers of XRP. For example, the crypto went on a spectacular run in July, when Ripple scored a partial victory against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. According to Bard, optimism regarding Ripple’s advancements against the SEC in court, an upswing in the general crypto market in 2024, and XRP’s adoption in cross border payments could send the crypto to the $1 price level again next year, a level which it hasn’t been since November 2021. If adoption keeps increasing at this rate, XRP might hit $3 and possibly even hit its current all-time high of $3.84. But according to Bard, in order for this to occur, XRP would need to demand increased usage and technological developments in the token’s Ledger. If things go smoothly and XRP achieves adoption in retail payments, demand could go up, with Bard estimating a 3 to 5-year journey to reach $3. XRP market cap currently at $33.347 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Lastly, Bard predicted a more mainstream adoption of XRP could see the crypto spike well above $5. However, the AI noted this is a very long journey potentially taking 5 to 10 years or more. The crypto reaching $5 seems like a lofty goal, but several factors could drive the price up and beyond. A major factor in achieving this price target is XRP’s complete integration with traditional finance. Unlike most cryptocurrencies looking to displace banks, XRP was created to complement the current financial system. At the time of writing, it is supported by over 100 banks, financial institutions, and payment systems. According to Bard, XRP’s displacement of the current payment remittance methods and a merger with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), are two of the major factors that could propel the crypto’s price over $5 in the coming years.

Here’s What This Crypto Analyst Thinks","The bulls seem to be back in control following the return of the Bitcoin price to above $43,000 this past week. This positive run comes on the back of a period where the premier cryptocurrency struggled, falling below $41,000 at some point. However, the market leader appears to have regained most of its lost momentum, with new heights now in sight. A popular crypto pundit on the X platform has put forward a new prognosis and set a new target for the Bitcoin price. BTC Price To $47,000? Here’s What Needs To Happen In a post on X, crypto analyst Ali Martinez offered insight into the price action of Bitcoin, explaining the potential movements of the cryptocurrency over the coming weeks. This evaluation is based on the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) data by the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode. A chart showing the UTXO Realized Price Distribution of Bitcoin | Source: Ali_charts/X Martinez identified the $43,200 area as a crucial support level, which can potentially determine the fate of Bitcoin’s price. The premier cryptocurrency broke above this price zone on Wednesday, December 20, and has been trading mostly sideways since. Related Reading: Analyst Points To Increasing Caution In Bitcoin Market Despite Price Surge In his post, Martinez highlighted that so long as the vital $43,200 support holds, the momentum is with the Bitcoin bulls. According to the crypto analyst, staying above this support is one catalyst that could push the Bitcoin price to above $47,360. On the flip side of his analysis, he noted that the Bitcoin price could possibly undergo a correction. The crypto pundit emphasized that one of the bearish signals to watch out for is a sustained close below the crucial $43,200 mark. According to Martinez’s projection, a close below $43,200 could send the price of BTC down towards $37,000. This would mean a decline of over 15% from the current price point. Bitcoin Price Overview As of this writing, the Bitcoin price stands at $43,783, reflecting a mere 0.5% gain in the last 24 hours. On the weekly timeframe, though, the premier cryptocurrency has shown tremendous recovery to return back to its heights of early January.

This is a strong demonstration of resilience. The price of SOL has surged, reaching a level not seen since the night before Terra collapsed a year and a half ago. This coincides with a substantial uptick in meme coin activity in the cryptocurrency space, which is helping to increase the platform’s acceptance and appeal.

Part of the reason for the current increase in Solana’s value is the industry’s general rebound in cryptocurrency.
