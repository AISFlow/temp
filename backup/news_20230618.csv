Quant Collaborates With BIS And The Bank Of England Project Rosalind is a central bank digital currency (CBDC) initiative, led by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Bank of England. It aims to explore the implementation of APIs in CBDC systems to facilitate retail payments. Project Rosalind focuses on leveraging APIs in CBDCs and investigating innovative use cases for the technology. The project uses a collaborative model between the public and private sectors. The public sector provides the needed infrastructure, and the private sector is responsible for developing consumer applications. Related Reading: ZachXBT Slapped With Defamation Lawsuit For MachiBigBrother Exposé Quant contributed to the development of Project Rosalind, by designing and developing API functionalities that would enable programmability within the private sector. Following the announcement of their contribution, QUANT soared 20%, reversing losses posted early this week. Besides designing, Quant also provided the underlying infrastructure and blockchain platform, needed for the interoperability of central bank ledgers. Gilbert Verdian, Founder and CEO of Quant, expressed enthusiasm about the potential of CBDCs, saying: “For the first time, money is ready for the digital age. A CBDC will enable citizens and businesses to automate cumbersome payments and processes and implement logic into money. For commercial banks and other institutions, the opportunity to apply this programmability to create innovative new products that differentiate themselves from challengers and competitors is almost endless. We encourage every bank and financial institution to read the Project Rosalind report and start planning their smart money infrastructure strategy.” Project Rosalind And CBDCs Project Rosalind, led by the London Centre, was designed to tackle crucial issues within the retail CBDCs’ development. These issues include improving public-private sector collaboration, maximizing interoperability, and meeting the constantly changing needs of citizens. Project Rosalind seeks to improve public-private sector collaboration by creating prototype APIs that enable a central bank to interact safely with private sector service providers. The project adopts a two-tier distribution model, with the central bank in the background, forming the foundation of the retail CBDC and private sector applications handling customer requests. Related Reading: Binance Coin (BNB) Faces Sideways Movement, Bears Threaten Further Sell-Off Through extensive collaborations, Project Rosalind has demonstrated that APIs can play a crucial role in enhancing CBDCs’ payment functionalities and security. By leveraging distributed ledger technologies like blockchain, Quant can also fulfill its vision of being a decentralized network of networks, bringing greater reliability and security to various industries.

Early this week, BTC prices crashed to as low as $24,820 before recovering to spot rates, adding 8% in four days. Retail Investors Are Buying The Dip Following a turbulent week in the crypto space, which involved the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, Binance and “crypto” securities-related drama, the price of Bitcoin dipped below $25,000 after the Federal Reserve paused their rate hikes and keeping the US fund rate within the 5% and 5.25% zone, increasing the uncertainty within the market. Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) Witnesses High Volatility Amid Positive Developments However, the crypto market has since rebounded, with retail bitcoin investors, characterized by those holding 0.01 to 1 BTC, stepping in to buy up the dip. Interestingly, the dip-buying behavior exhibited by retail investors is similar in level to that observed during the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapse earlier in the year, but less than that of the post FTX collapse crash which saw Bitcoin’s price tank below $16,000. With retailers loading up, it could indicate that traders and holders are confident of what lies ahead despite recent unfavorable fundamentals. Bitcoin Whales On The Move Meanwhile, with active Bitcoin retail buyers ramping up, “whales” have also been on the move. Crypto whales are addresses holding large amount of coins. A Twitter user also noted that a user with 50 BTC worth around $1.2 million recently moved his coins after being dormant since 2010. The batch of coins was originally mined in June 2010 and had remained untouched since then before being moved. Following the trend, another previously dormant Bitcoin wallet, that has been dormant for a decade, transferred $7.8 million worth of BTC to a new wallet. Another long-term holder moved $11 million worth of BTC after more than 11 years of inactivity. Related Reading: Bitcoin Recovers Above Critical Level, Why Bulls Could Be Ready To Charge At the pivotal moment of BTC’s price and the crypto space, speculators are raising questions about the motives behind such massive movements of BTC. It is known that the trading activities resulting from the transfers can impact the coin’s supply and demand dynamics of Bitcoin, potentially exerting short-term influence on prices. As of writing on June 18, Bitcoin is firm above $26,500, and has reversed losses of June 14. With retailers appearing to be buying the dip, prices may recover in the days ahead, even rallying to $30,000. Even so, Bitcoin remains under pressure and traders should watch how fundamental events, including the SEC lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, would shape price action.

This positive price movement is quite significant for many APT investors, as the APT market has been under bearish control for most of 2023. Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) Witnesses High Volatility Amid Positive Developments Aptos’ Unimpressive 2023 Aptos began the year with a bang, surging by over 500% to hit its all-time high price of $18.58 on January 26. However, the prominent altcoin had since experienced a steady decline since then, with little insignificant price rises. Due to such disappointing price movement, much concern has been over what was touted as “one of the most promising tokens of 2023”. The Aptos project, which was launched back in October 2022, received a lot of hype coming into the crypto space. Much of this interest was driven by the blockchain being an indirect product of the now-defunct Diem blockchain initiative. Aptos boasts various impressive features, including a unique programming language – Move – a parallel execution engine, low transaction costs, and high-level security features. On June 10, APT was trading as low as $5.74, indicating a 69.11% decline from its ATH value in January. However, following its recent impressive performance, many investors wonder if the altcoin could actually be readying for market reversal. Based on data from CoinMarketCap, APT is trading at $7.05, with a 5.38% gain on the last day. The token’s daily trading volume has also moved by 125.76%, attaining a value of $274 million. Meanwhile, APT’s market cap is currently at $1 billion. APT trading at $7.02 | Source: APTUSD Chart On Tradingview.com Related Reading: Bitcoin Recovers Above Critical Level, Why Bulls Could Be Ready To Charge Is The Market Reversal On? As earlier stated, APT’s current bullish run led to much speculation among investors, with many hoping the token could soon return to the glorious heights seen at the beginning of the year. This discourse is further fueled by various on-chain activities, an example of which is the gradual increase in daily user transactions on the Aptos network over the last few months. According to data from aptscan.ai, an analytics tool native to the Aptos chain, the number of daily active daily transactions on the network moved from 75,806 on March 1 to 162,071 on June 16, yesterday.

According to popular price prediction site, Coincodex, the current investor sentiment around APT is neutral, with a Fear & Greed index of 49, indicating the token may be a favorable investment at this point in time. The team predicts APT to decline only by 0.86% in the next 5 days. They remain largely optimistic, backing an APT reversal as they project the token to hit a price of $15.32 in the next month.

Few understand what is coming financially The fact probably needs to be faced that the vast majority of the world’s citizens still have no clue of the financial maelstrom that will hit them at some point over the next few months or years. Governments take advantage of, and it probably could be argued that they encourage, the ridiculously low level of financial education among the citizenry in general. If it weren’t for various internet platforms even those who do want to know what is really happening would just be stuck with media such as television where even the most benign debates are just a circus show and an excuse for proper economic conversations among experts. Holding fiat will not protect you So back to the savings, a process once viewed as a perfectly normal and intelligent thing to do. Anyway, people still do it, probably blissfully unaware of how what they have saved has reduced in purchasing power - the more drastically the longer it has been saved. It could probably be safely argued that in general keeping one’s currency in traditional areas such as bonds, stocks, and even in real estate, will not protect the wealth of the individual if the worst is to happen. What could that ‘worst’ be? That doesn’t come into the scope of this article, but suffice to say that a black swan, such as a really bad recession, could lead to governments having the excuse they need to impose their central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and then also bring in their ‘great reset’, which could make the existing fiat currency worthless. That sort of scenario and how it might be survived is indeed food for thought. A traditional hedge Traditionally, in order to add some measure of protection and insurance to one's portfolio, gold is the asset to have. This is still true today, although with the caveat that the gold price is still arguably manipulated by banks. Even so, gold should at least protect what you have. Bitcoin even better? This finally brings us to Bitcoin, an asset that is similar to gold, in that it has a scarce supply, and cannot be debased, although it must be recognised that gold does have a 2% inflation each year which is equivalent to the newly mined supply that is added to the total of above ground stocks. Contrary to this, Bitcoin has a halving every 4 years that is built into the code, and this cuts the supply in 2. Add to this the portability of bitcoin - it recognises no national borders and can be sent to anyone in any country in the world, cheaply and without any bank, regulatory agency or government being able to say no. Gold and silver have had their prices manipulated on the Western LBMA and COMEX exchanges for decades, so even though they are sound money they have been able to be controlled by the big banks. Bitcoin is outside of the system so the banks and government cannot do much about it. However, the recent Blackrock Bitcoin Spot ETF filing could be a first step for government, through the proxy of the world’s largest asset manager, to be able to start exerting some control over Bitcoin should at least one scenario play out. Now is a time for decision We have arrived at the junction of a new world order and what the average investor does now can go a long way towards protecting them in what is likely to be a very different monetary system. Bearing in mind that all fiat currencies in history have always gone to zero, it will be incumbent for every investor to watch their government and central bank very closely and to do their research on the options that might protect them.

13939570,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=538397,1687093164,Shiba Inu (SHIB) Burn Rate Suffers 87% Decline In Single Week,"In recent weeks, the burn numbers of Shiba Inu tokens have not been particularly great, especially in the past seven days. This is despite the growing optimism amongst investors about the ecosystem’s prospects. In fact, there are speculations about a potential bullish run – as things stand. The price of the SHIB coin has been on a steady rise recently, gaining over 7% in the last seven days. According to data from CoinGecko, SHIB is currently valued at $0.00000716, with a daily trading volume of more than $118.9 million. SHIBUSD trading at $0.00000717 | SHIBUSD chart from TradingView Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Positive Social Sentiment Sparks Bullish Speculation SHIB Burn Rate Drops By 87% The amount of SHIB tokens sent to the dead wallet has decreased dramatically in the past seven days. Interestingly, these dwindling burn numbers coincide with the launch of an in-real-life (IRL) component by the popular meme-inspired ecosystem. This positive development capped off what was an overall great week. That said, the dramatic dip in the amount of Shiba Inu tokens being burnt might be something to worry about. According to data from the Shibburn wallet tracker on Twitter, only 38,673,239 SHIB tokens were transferred to the dead wallet in the last seven days, indicating an 87% overall decrease in the token’s burn rate. It is worth noting that SHIB’s burn rate is on some recovery at the moment, as over a million tokens have been set ablaze in the past day. This represents a whopping 281% burn rate increase in the last 24 hours. Shibacals Launches In Anticipation Of Shibarium Shytoshi Kusama, a prominent Shiba Inu developer, has noted in the past the challenge of moving the SHIB price based on burns only. He, however, said introducing new technologies and utilities and expanding the ecosystem can help boost SHIB’s value. With the falling burn numbers and the launch of Shibarium drawing closer, it is clear that there should be a focus on improving the project’s value through new products and technologies. Hence, it can be said that the launch of Shibacals – the in-real-life component of Shiba Inu – is a move in the right direction. This newly-launched product is expected to push the ecosystem beyond the digital space. According to a tweet showing a screenshot of Shytoshi’s message, Shibacals also brings us one step closer to the takeoff of Shibarium – Shiba Inu’s Layer-2 protocol. Although there is no set date for the launch of the layer-2 protocol, there are strong speculations it will launch in the Q3 of 2023. That said, the Shibarium protocol is expected to undergo a series of tests and audits before it goes live on the mainnet.

But since buying the company, Twitter has become anything but. In the latest example of Twitter’s heavy-handed censorship last week, a staggering 100,000+ accounts were reportedly either blocked or suspended simply for mentioning an aspiring crypto project, Metatime, as part of a token airdrop campaign. Twitter is one of the favorite social media platforms of crypto projects, serving as a place to share information and hold discussions with their communities. So the decision to ban over 100,000 accounts simply for retweeting and sharing messages posted by Metatime was a huge shock. Horrified by Twitter’s latest act of censorship, the crypto community sprung into action, with thousands of people sharing the hashtag #FreeMetaTime to draw attention to what happened and try to get the accounts unblocked. The #FreeMetaTime campaign was inspired by a tweet from Metatime CEO Yusuf Sevim, who appealed to Musk personally to intervene and get the locked, banned and suspended accounts back to their rightful owners. In his Tweet, Sevim explained that Metatime is a “freedom project” that has already brought hope to more than 350,000 supporters globally since its launch just six months ago. He explained how the MetaAirdrop campaign gives those people a chance to earn free MetatimeCoin ($MTC) tokens by sharing their ideas and support for the project. “Unfortunately, today, Twitter accounts of more than 100,000 users (some of them following @MetatimeCom and our other Metatime ecosystem accounts and most of them are at least 5 years old), were locked, banned, or suspended without any justified reason,” Sevim said. “Overnight, the voices of thousands of people sharing the hope of Metatime and MetaAirdrop were attempted to be silenced. Notably, this calamity struck the very morning after the day we announced our listing on the stock exchange on 26.06.2023.” Sevim said the decision to ban so many accounts isn’t just a problem for Metatime, but for everyone who uses Twitter and social media platforms. He said it raises serious questions about who determines what the boundaries of freedom of thought and expression are. “@ElonMusk, I reach out to you as a powerful businessperson, innovator, and thought leader. We ask you to defend our thoughts, our voice, and our community's right to stand together and express our ideas freely,” Sevim said. “What is being done to Metatime today might have been done to you in the past, and could be done to any free-thinking individual tomorrow.” Hello @ElonMusk, with great hope and warm regards,Metatime is a freedom project powered by Blockchain technology that, in just a short 6 months, has brought hope to more than 350,000 people worldwide, helping them forge their freedoms and futures. With MetaAirdrop, tens of… — Yusuf Sevim (@Yusuf_Metatime) June 15, 2023 Sadly for Metatime, Sevim’s tweet and a follow up post have both gone unanswered and it’s believed that many thousands of accounts still remain inaccessible to their users. Though it’s undoubtedly true that Musk is an extremely busy man and may not have seen Sevim’s tweet, his inaction stands at odds with public statements from him and Twitter’s new CEO Linda Yaccarino. In a recent memo to employees after taking up her role as CEO, Yaccarino stated that a healthy civilization needs an ""unfiltered exchange of information and open dialogue about the things that matter most to us."" She added that, “You should have the freedom to speak your mind. We all should.” There’s no reason to disbelieve Yaccarino’s comment, but what happened to Metatime clearly demonstrates that Twitter still has a lot of work to do if it’s too live up to those promises. In the meantime, Metatime’s co-founder Hys Sahin stated that the project will keep up the pressure on Musk and Twitter until every single blocked account is restored to its user: A heartfelt thank you to all who stood by our fellow members with suddenly blocked Twitter accounts. Your support, shown through ""Free Metatime"" posts, is truly remarkable,” Sahin said. “Together, we'll continue supporting one another until every account is unblocked.

Embarking on a strategic initiative, Binance has ingeniously incorporated Floki Inu into two exceptional categories within its expansive ecosystem, namely the Metaverse and Gaming sections. With this development, Binance has effectively opened up new avenues for the crypto named after billionaire Elon Musk’s dog, propelling its growth trajectory and solidifying its position as a prominent player in the ever-evolving crypto landscape. #Binance has added $FLOKI to the #Metaverse and #Gaming categories on its exchange! 🔥 This is a big deal and allows millions of users to trade #Floki alongside top metaverse and gaming cryptocurrencies like $SAND, $MANA, $AXS, $IMX, $GALA, and $ENJ.#Floki adoption continues! pic.twitter.com/UKIssfoOih — FLOKI (@RealFlokiInu) June 16, 2023 The Floki Inu team may have hoped that news of Binance’s decision to add the meme to the Metaverse area would increase the value of their coin, but this was not the case today. Floki Inu Price Wasn’t Feeling It At the time of writing, FLOKI price was nearly unchanged, managing to notch a meager 1.4% increase in the last 24 hours, data from crypto market tracker Coingecko shows. In the last seven days, the meme coin was only able to maintain a less than 5% gain. Source: Coingecko The dog-themed token was likewise struggling in the 14-day and 30-day timeframes, shedding an average of 30% declines as questions about its capability to reclaim its recent strong performance mount. Source: Coingecko Floki’s popularity has been on the rise in recent months, making it the fourth largest meme coin by market cap. Bitci, a leading cryptocurrency exchange in Turkey with more than 5 million customers, has added support for the token. The meme coin’s recent tweet, stating its plans to develop a crypto education platform, also caused a stir in the crypto community. The University Of Floki is an online resource designed to meet the needs of the estimated 1 billion cryptocurrency users worldwide by 2025. As of today, the market cap of cryptocurrencies stood at $1.03 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com By placing Floki Inu in the Metaverse section of the exchange, Binance has essentially set up the way for the meme coin to flourish in the field of virtual reality and digital environment. By also realizing Floki Inu’s potential in the gaming industry, Binance has created a link between the cryptocurrency industry and the ever-evolving world of digital entertainment. Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) Sees Surge In Whale Buying Despite US Regulatory Pressure Dismal Social Volume Figure Meanwhile, Santiment’s research reveals that FLOKI’s social volume suggests there was minimal excitement or speculation about the token after the Binance metaverse integration was announced. The social volume measures the amount of buzz surrounding a coin in a certain time frame. FLOKI weighted sentiment and social volume. Source: Santiment Like the total social volume, the weighted sentiment of FLOKI remained in the negative zone. Despite some uncertainty, the general attitude toward FLOKI has remained unfavorable as measured by its weighted sentiment rating of (minus) 0.536. This number is an aggregate expression of opinion across all available data on FLOKI, such as threads, comments, and interactions. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Positive Social Sentiment Sparks Bullish Speculation Persistently unfavorable sentiment indicates widespread doubt, anxiety, or discontent about FLOKI and its associated variables among the community and market participants. If people are generally optimistic while talking about a token, it can be inferred that their opinion toward the asset is good. In contrast, FLOKI’s predominance of negative numbers indicates that pessimistic commentary predominates. This shows that people are mostly apprehensive rather than optimistic about the meme coin.
