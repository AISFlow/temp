42378141,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MDLZ,1428440702,Style is King in BitFlyer Block Explorer Release,"BitFlyer has released a new block explorer that it hopes will provide a more colorful and robust offering amidst the growing landscape for online bitcoin tools.  Dubbed chainFlyer, the visualizer provides an illustrated environment in which users can examine individual bitcoin transactions, inspect completed blocks on the bitcoin ledger and search for information on the blockchain.  Transactions are depicted as multicolored charms that descend from the top of the screen, chiming when they fall to the browser floor. In turn, blocks are pictured as boxes that can be opened and examined for transaction information.  Overall, the block explorer seems to prioritize style over function, though it has goals of appealing to a more technical audience as well, with tags that allow users to save searches.  CEO Yuzo Kano told CoinDesk:  ”This is very similar to Blockchain.info except we have the scrypts and commands of each transaction.”  Kano acknowledged that such an in-depth look into the bitcoin ledger would be for more technical audiences. However, he expressed his hope that the animated and musical nature of the site would inspire those who lack a technical background but are curious about the blockchain to take a closer look.  BitFlyer has so far raised $2.9m over three rounds of fundraising.

42378138,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MDGX,1428435063,Australian Central Bank: Bitcoin Regulation Not Worth the Cost,"The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has indicated that it is not in favor of regulating bitcoin and other digital currencies, stating that “it is currently unlikely that any benefits of regulation would outweigh the potential costs”.  The statements, issued on 7th April, are the latest from Australia’s central bank, which went so far as to propose that coordinated cross-border regulation is necessary given bitcoin’s potential to disrupt the global remittance industry.  The RBA suggested it could seek cooperation from the Bank for International Settlements, an international organisation of central banks, and its Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI), which includes representatives from Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the US.  Overall, the “opening statement” into its inquiry of the technology was neutral toward the development of digital currencies, suggesting there is “nothing to prevent” two parties from engaging in transactions via these channels.  Further, the RBA offered its opinion that digital currencies, if left unregulated, are unlikely to cause significant economic disruptions, writing:  “The bank's judgement is that the current very limited use of digital currencies means that they do not raise any significant concerns with respect to competition, efficiency or risk to the financial system.”  The RBA is currently investigating the subject as part of its Economics References Committee, which examines issues as diverse as tax avoidance and affordable housing.  The central bank first began exploring the subject in a 2013 paper for its Payments Systems Board.

42378139,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MDJ3,1428432314,Dissent Lingers as Bitcoin Foundation Denounces Bankruptcy Threat,"The Bitcoin Foundation board of directors has issued a new statement on the controversy surrounding its current financial situation and proposed restructuring.  Overall, the blog post seeks to clarify perceived misstatements issued over the weekend in a post that generated widespread discussion in the community. The full release takes aim at accusations that the organisation is “bankrupt” and has fired “90% of its staff”.  Though attributed to the Bitcoin Foundation board of directors, the statement does not seem to represent the board in its entirety. Both board members representing the individual members of the foundation, Olivier Janssens and Jim Harper, state that the release was prepared and distributed without their knowledge.  Perhaps most notably, the post alleges that a measure to split up the foundation into two entities, one focused on promotion, the other on core development, has been approved by the board of directors, stating:  ”In the last board meeting, the management team presented an austere, yet clear, path forward for the board. The board of directors voted on March 31, 2015 to proceed with the strategic plan and to work out a communications plan to roll out the decision along with the finished annual report for members and the public.”  The statements have been questioned by Janssens and Harper, though the latter called the release “a fair correction of some details” relating to the organisation's financial situation.  The post suggests the foundation's financial troubles are purely tied to the decline in the price of bitcoin, not the result of its spending as suggested, and explains that interim executive director Patrick Murck will continue in his current position without pay.  Vote dispute  Both Harper and Janssens told CoinDesk that while a formal vote was taken at the last board meeting, they are not satisfied that the proposal was approved as suggested.  Janssens took his criticism of the statement to the Bitcoin Foundation forum, suggesting that the vote was limited to a decision on how the organization should proceed with regards to its obligations to its staff.  “We only voted on firing staff,” Janssens wrote. “No plan was approved. The board minutes will back that up. To quote Patrick ‘the only thing that we’re voting on in this vote is to reduce cost by cutting headcount’.”  Janssens also hit back at the language used by the post, suggesting that any issues with specific numbers or phrases he used were secondary to the overall message, that staff has been laid off and the group’s financial future is currently in question.  ""It does not address my main point of hiding the real financial status from its members for so long,"" Janssens told CoinDesk.  In separate remarks, Harper attempted to categorize the proposal as one that lacks sufficient depth, especially in contrast to one he suggested to the board.  “[The proposal] didn’t have a list of employees, near-term activities, long-term activities. Taking the parts of the document about the foundation and what it should do, ask yourself if you could run a foundation on that,” he said.  Brock Pierce and Mickey Malka reported that they agree with the document’s version of events, and expressed their disappointment that the continued debate may erode the public image of the organisation.  The Bitcoin Foundation did not respond to requests for further comment at press time.

42378134,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MDE1,1428427814,Rand Paul Accepts Bitcoin for Presidential Campaign,"Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, who today formally announced his bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, has begun accepting bitcoin donations.  Donors can select bitcoin from a number of available payment options, with bitcoin payments being enabled by processor BitPay.  Paul is perhaps the most high-profile American politician to accept bitcoin donations, and latest of a number of state and national Republicans to turn to the digital currency for fundraising support.  Last year, the US Federal Elections Commission gave its approval for bitcoin fundraising as a type of in-kind donation. States like Tennessee have since made some progress in clarifying those rules on the state level.  Bitcoin 'outlier'  Paul touched on the subject of bitcoin earlier this year during a panel discussion led by TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington. Calling himself ""an outlier"" on ""the bitcoin thing"", the senator acknowledged his skepticism toward the digital currency.  ""I've been fascinated by the concept of it, but I never would have purchased it myself. I'm just a little bit skeptical,"" he said at the time, according to a report from Bloomberg News.  During a 2014 interview, Paul suggested that the concept of digital currencies could be improved if they were backed by stocks.  An opthamologist by trade, Paul was elected to the US Senate in 2010 with significant support from the Tea Party movement, a collection of right-wing and libertarian-leaning groups that has since proven to be an influential – and controversial – force within the American political landscape.  Paul is one of several candidates, including Texas Senator Ted Cruz, that will compete for Tea Party support during the Republican presidential primary.

42378120,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MD0B,1428411775,Bitcoin Firm Coinapult Restores Services Following Hack,"Bitcoin storage provider and payment processor Coinapult is back online following a hack-related outage last month.  Following a series of security improvements, Coinapult users can now deposit funds and 'lock' and 'unlock' their bitcoin to fiat currencies or assets. They were previously given login access on 21st March and withdrawals were re-enabled five days later.  The hot wallet attack, which occurred on 17th March, resulted in the loss of 150 BTC (approximately $42,900). Coinapult announced it was halting all operations via Twitter the same day.  At the time, Coinapult COO and CFO Justin Blincoe said customer funds had been unaffected, as the hot wallet was only used to store funds owned by the bitcoin startup.  In a bid to prevent future incidents, Coinapult has implemented 2 of 3 multisignature security, meaning that every withdrawal must now be cosigned by a Coinapult executive.  A company blog post noted:  ""This manual cosigning is an extremely safe method of operation, but will result in delays making withdrawals. Our team will only be cosigning transactions during the hours of 9am-9pm in Panama (UTC−5).""  The blog post also confirmed that moving to a client-side signing system was of the ""highest priority"" for Coinapult, noting that the company was working ""hard to restore instant withdrawals"".    u-tableCell u-alignBottom"">  Coinapult's operational wallet is being handled by Coinkite's BitKit APIhttps://coinkite.com/developers.                        Additional security            Coinapult has investigated the hacking incident but is yet to determine the specific entry point of the attack.  In a bid to heighten its security, the company says it has moved its operations to new servers and a new hosting location.  Having suffered subsequent Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in the aftermath of the hot wallet attack, Coinapult is now protected by CloudFlare, a service which aims to improve the availability of websites and mobile apps.  Coinapult's hack follows other high-profile security breaches this year. Bitcoin exchange Bitstamp lost approximately $5.1m worth of bitcoin following an attack on its hot wallet in January.  Canadian bitcoin exchange CAVirtex also ceased its operations following the compromise loss sensitive security information, which included password hashes and two-factor authentication information.

42378136,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MDFH,1428375873,Bitcoin Foundation Divided Over Controversial Restructuring Proposal,"Less than six months after the Bitcoin Foundation announced its intention to focus solely on core development, it is once again at a financial and existential crossroads that finds the future of the trade organization shrouded in uncertainty.  Though much about the situation remains obscured by argument, current board members, core developers and the group’s interim executive director Patrick Murck agree that, at the very least, the Bitcoin Foundation will no longer be best positioned to continue financing bitcoin development in current form.  At issue, however, is the present state of the organization’s finances, the actions that have been taken by an outspoken board member to alert the public of the issue and how the group could move forward given the level of distrust among key members.  First prompted by a 4th April post, the recent debate was triggered by board member Olivier Janssens, who called the Bitcoin Foundation “effectively bankrupt” and encouraged readers “not to fall for” attempts by the organization to control the message regarding its balance sheet.  Janssens wrote:  ”The lesson for all of us in bitcoin is to never put any trust in a centralized organization again that wanted to represent bitcoin or the core development of bitcoin.”  Though greeted with enthusiasm on social media forums, Murck indicated his belief that this weekend’s post, and the conflict that ensued, undermines the organisation’s viable business operations. These include its recently launched conference series effort DevCore, which he suggested could now be unable to garner sponsorships due to in-fighting.  Murck told CoinDesk that though he had already planned to step down as interim executive director, he will be volunteering his time toward the role until such time as the board of directors elected a new appointee to the position.  Janssens had previously campaigned on a platform that was openly critical of the organisation’s approach to transparency and past conduct, having launched efforts to replace the foundation with innovations such as the decentralised crowdfunding platform Lighthouse.  A promotional body  One path forward has so far been put forward by Murck, who outlined a proposal to pivot the foundation toward becoming a more general interest and advocacy group in a board meeting on 17th March, though this has not been without contention.  According to a newly released proposal dated 5th March provided to CoinDesk by the Bitcoin Foundation, the group envisions splitting into two separate entities charged with supporting bitcoin core development and promoting bitcoin more broadly, respectively.  ""To continue funding an engineering team within the Foundation, we will need a significant infusion of cash or potentially be insolvement in ~8 weeks,"" the proposal reads.  Murck told CoinDesk that he believes such a pivot would be a practical business idea due the concerns donors have expressed about the foundation being responsible for bitcoin development.  Notably, the proposal suggests that the IRS may be reconsidering the group's status as a 501(c)6 organization due its support for the bitcoin protocol. Murck indicated that the measure will need to be approved by a majority board vote.  Need for a new entity  Murck also spoke about the foundation's need to break off its core development business due to feedback from the community.  An insurmountable issue that arose, according to Murck, is the structure of the foundation itself, which must change its board members after two-year terms.  “[Donors] were concerned that the foundation was structurally broken, that if they gave money, then two months from now, the board would just suddenly change its mind and do something completely different. That wasn’t something that we could solve,” Murck said.  The proposal calls for Murck and Andresen to take the lead on funding the new core development entity, which aims to raise $2m in seed capital. However, Murck suggested that current in-fighting at the organisation has so far prohibited any action on this front.  Murck suggested that such criticisms were larger than single board members, though recently elected individual members Jim Harper and Janssens both considered themselves to be change candidates who were critical of this mission.  Debate ignited  It seems that, as of now, key members within the Bitcoin Foundation are taking sides based on how the situation has so far been handled.  Murck, along with other Bitcoin Foundation members, have accused Janssens of spinning a situation that was soon-to-be announced to his own advantage, a charge that he denies on the basis of transparency being a key aspect of his election mandate.  The Bitcoin Foundation has said that the organisation’s annual financials were to be released this week, along with an announcement about the proposed pivot. Still, the interpretation of these planned events remains contentious on ideological lines.  “Their biggest argument will probably be that I released ‘prematurely’ and they would tell the truth in due time, because this would allow the organization to survive. I felt that was deceptive and dishonest,” Janssens told CoinDesk. “Basically that means they were hiding the truth from their members to be able to survive.”  As to whether Janssens may have violated any fiduciary duties to act in the best interest of the foundation, Janssens has found an ally in Harper.  “A board member gets to participate in setting the direction of the foundation, and we came to the board with a view of what the foundation is supposed to do and how the foundation is supposed to do it and holding that view doesn’t violate our duty of care to the board,” Harper said in an interview.  Harper previously served as the foundation’s general counsel through November 2014, when he was laid off amid an initial wave of staff cuts.  The Bitcoin Foundation declined to provide information related to its current staff levels.  Board gridlock  Already, Janssens and Harper paint a picture of deep divisions at the Foundation, with Harper questioning if a proposal to shift the direction of the organization was formally heard as suggested.  “Patrick put forward a number of documents and there was some discussion among members around some things. But I wasn’t satisfied that there was a proposal put forth,” Harper said.  Harper called this disagreement an example of the “ad-hoc” nature by which foundation business is being conducted, suggesting that the Bitcoin Foundation is currently behaving in a way that is inconsistent with non-profit board norms.  Both Harper and Janssens indicate that their proposal to publish meeting minutes, with certain sensitive materials redacted, was “largely ignored”, something both said have contributed to frustrations.  Conversely, Murck alleges that Janssens has been unwilling to offer proactive solutions to the challenges at hand. In particular, he struck back against the claim that the foundation had fired most of its staff as “not truthful”.  “Saying that the foundation is bankrupt is totally wrong. Saying that the foundation over the long run this isn’t sustainable, that’s a different thing,” he added.  Core development cut off  Regardless of Murck’s proposal, core developers supported financially in full or in part by the foundation, including Gavin Andresen, Wladimir van der Laan, Cory Fields and Sergio Lerner, may be already seeking funding elsewhere for their work.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Andresen indicated that he is no longer on the foundation’s payroll as of 1st April, but that he remains a part of the organisation as an advisor and volunteer.  As for paths forward, Andresen indicated that both he and the other former staff developers would seek to “not get too distracted” by what he characterized as “drama”.  However, he provided some comment that suggested core development may be being used as a political football in a larger debate.  “I will say that it is nice so many people are concerned about how Wladimir and Cory and I will make a living, but in the end it is up to us, individually, to decide what is best. Sometimes it feels like ‘the bitcoin community’ expects to micro-manage our professional lives ‘for the good of bitcoin’, but that isn't how open-source projects work,” he continued.  Core developer Jeff Garzik provided his support for this viewpoint in statements, suggesting that bitcoin development should be funded in a decentralised manner by private companies.  “People – not just Olivier – want to create some anointed organization for anointed individuals when it doesn't really work that way,” the developer, who works full time at BitPay, added. “Decentralized, open-source development means many people at many organizations.”  Other board members including venture capitalist Brock Pierce; BTC China CEO Bobby Lee; BitPay account manager Elizabeth Ploshay and Ribbit Capital’s Micky Malka were unresponsive to press requests or offered no comment for the report.
