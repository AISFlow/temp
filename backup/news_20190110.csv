As such, market participants can independently verify all deposits, withdrawals and other transactions associated with their wallet.  The new system also increases the number of wallets malicious actors would have to attack if they wish to steal funds, according to a press release.  Edward Woodford, co-founder and CEO of Seed CX, said in a statement that the exchange is looking to ""make it as difficult for hackers as possible"" to steal funds, and limit the amount that could potentially be stolen.  Woodford added:  ""On-chain settlement helps Seed CX provide trading firms with an experience that is both cost effective and high performance, while also providing the operational and financial security investors demand.""  Zero Hash public director Julie Myers-Wood explained that the company learned from issues other exchanges faced, according to a statement.  ""Giving participants full visibility into their own unique wallets is a big part of that, but it’s not enough.

The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) published its new “Regulation for Managing Blockchain Information Services” on Thursday, defining blockchain information service providers as “entities or nodes” that offer information services to the public using blockchain technology via desktop sites or mobile apps. The rules become official on February 15, according to the release.  Among the 23 articles listed in the document, one requires blockchain service providers to register with the CAC within 10 working days of starting to offer services to the public.  The agency also mandates that blockchain startups must register their names, service types, industry fields and server addresses. Further, it bans startups from using blockchain technology to “produce, duplicate, publish, and disseminate” information or content that is prohibited by Chinese laws.  If blockchain startups fail to comply with the rules, the CAC said it would first issue a warning, while failure to act within the specified timeline would bring a fine ranging from 5,000 yuan ($737) to 30,000 yuan ($4,422), depending upon the offense.  The CAC first published draft rules in October of last year. At that time, one of the articles also recommended that blockchain startups operating in fields such as news reporting, publishing, education and the pharmaceutical industry must also obtain licenses from relevant authorities prior to registration with the CAC. The final rules have dropped this article altogether.  Previously, blockchain technology has been utilized to bypass China’s strict internet censorship – often dubbed “The Great Firewall.” For example, as part of the #Metoo movement and a recent pharmaceutical scandal in the country, individuals posted information on the ethereum blockchain to avoid censorship.

The Ministry of Science and ICT, the Korea Internet & Security Agency and the Ministry of Economy and Finance inspected a total of 21 crypto exchanges from September to December 2018, examining 85 different security aspects.  Notably, only 7 of them – Upbit, Bithumb, Gopax, Korbit, Coinone, Hanbitco, and Huobi Korea – cleared all the tests, CoinDesk Korea reported Thursday.  The remaining 14 exchanges are ""vulnerable to hacking attacks at all times because of poor security,"" the Ministry of Economy and Finance said, though it didn't name the platforms. The agencies put down the security failures to “insufficient establishment and management of security system such as basic PC and network security.”  The exchanges were inspected in a review that looked different aspects of administrative, network, system and operational security, as well as database backup and wallet management.  South Korea has lost many millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies through hacks at exchanges such as Coinrail (over $40 million) and Bithumb (over $30 million).  Back in February, the country’s officials said that they believed North Korean hackers were behind the attacks. Indeed, North Korea’s infamous hacking group, Lazarus, has been reported to be behind the theft of $571 million in cryptocurrencies since January 2017, according to a report from cybersecurity vendor Group-IB.

The company has filed an initial registration form proposing the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The fund would track the Bitwise Bitcoin Total Return Index, which measures the value of bitcoin plus any ""meaningful hard forks.""  If the ETF is approved, its shares will be listed on NYSE Arca, which focuses on trading stocks and options (rather than large-cap stocks, which are traded on the New York Stock Exchange).  The initial registration statement indicates that Bitwise wants to underpin its index for the valuation of the fund with spot prices from exchanges and physically settled futures contracts, rather than cash-settled contracts, as earlier proposed ETFs would have done.  In a statement, Bitwise global head of Exchange-Traded Funds John Hyland noted that the SEC may not grant the application, adding:  ""We believe the crypto trading ecosystem has evolved in significant ways in the past year ... Having a regulated bank or trust company hold physical assets of a fund has been the standard under U.S. fund regulation for the last 80 years, and we believe that is now possible with bitcoin.""  Further, Hyland said, ""we are optimistic that 2019 should be the year that a bitcoin ETF launches.""  The SEC currently has one bitcoin ETF rule change proposal sitting before it, filed by VanEck and SolidX in partnership with Cboe last year. A decision on the proposal has been delayed a number of times, and now faces a final deadline of Feb. 27, 2019.  Past efforts  According to a press release, Bitwise's proposal differs from previous bitcoin ETF proposals by having regulated third-party custodians store the actual bitcoins in the trust.  Further, the index that the ETF is based on will determine prices using data drawn from a ""large number of cryptocurrency exchanges,"" which will allow it to represent ""the majority of currently verifiable bitcoin trading.""  Bitwise global head of research Matt Hougan said the company's proposal is informed by questions asked by the SEC in the past.  ""We have spent the past year researching these questions and look forward to discussing those findings with the SEC staff in connection with the filing and listing application,"" he added.  NYSE Arca will file for the required rule-change proposal ""in the coming days,"" the press release explained.

42402417,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdCg3t,1547130619,Security Token Trades on Regulated Platform in Market First,"A regulated alternative trading system (ATS) has facilitated a secondary trade of security tokens on a blockchain in a milestone for the development of this market.  SharesPost, a registered broker-dealer, ATS and registered investment advisor, said Wednesday it had executed its first secondary transaction with BCAP tokens issued by Blockchain Capital. The tokens, which run on top of the ethereum blockchain, represent shares in the Blockchain Capital III Digital Liquid Venture Fund.  SharesPost did not disclose the size of the trade for reasons of confidentiality, though SharesPost Digital Asset Group CEO John Wu told CoinDesk that it was essentially a proof-of-concept transaction. The Digital Asset Group is the division within SharesPost which oversaw the test.  ""This was a small trade, it's like a pilot program, we're 'running the water through the pipes' to make sure,"" he explained. ""To our knowledge, this was the first trade of digital securities by an Alternative Trading System and broker dealer in which the ATS custodied the digital securities. This clears the path for companies to do compliant STO’s in the U.S. and provide their investors with secondary liquidity.""  While SharesPost is the first registered firm to also custody the crypto assets it traded, it is not the first to conduct a secondary transaction overall. OpenFinance Network, another regulated ATS and broker-dealer, already offers BCAP tokens for trade, according to a press release.  Previously, SharesPost offered custody of digital assets and support for over-the-counter trading (OTC) of digital securities. Next, the company intends to launch real-time trading order books.  The company claims that it will be able to provide sufficient liquidity for institutions or other accredited investors shifting into digital assets. In a statement, SharesPost founder and CEO Greg Brogger predicted that ultimately, digital securities will play a prominent role in private capital markets.  Speaking to the significance of the BCAP trade, he explained:  ""Now companies can efficiently raise capital and provide liquidity globally by leveraging blockchain technology in a way that complies with securities laws. We are very excited to be connecting the more than 50,000 institutional and individual accredited investors using the SharesPost marketplace with companies and funds like Blockchain Capital that are leading the way.""  Blockchain Capital co-founder and managing partner Bart Stephens added in the announcement that ""SharesPost is unique in its support of private companies and funds because they offer a comprehensive platform on which our investors can interact to enable liquidity.""  In particular, Stephens said SharesPost will benefit the investor community by providing data and analysis on issuers and assets listed on its platform.  Editor's note: This article has been updated to note that OpenFinance Network has already conducted a similar secondary transaction, though it does not provide custody solutions.

42402412,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdCfxz,1547127000,Lawyers Rush In: New UNH Blockchain Program Nabs Big-Name Speakers,"It’s not a bear market for everyone.  “A crypto winter for the price is a crypto summer for attorneys,” said Jason Civalleri, adjunct professor at the University of New Hampshire Law School. “As the price sinks, you have a lot of demand for legal services.”  That’s why UNH Law is rushing to offer a new certificate program in blockchain and cryptocurrency. As exclusively told to CoinDesk, over 100 students have expressed interest in the program, which will feature of slew of industry players as guest lecturers – including Hester Peirce of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Ethereum Foundation researcher Vlad Zamfir and MyCrypto CEO Taylor Monahan.  “The law student that comes out today needs to be technologically proficient,” UNH professor and program director Tonya Evans told CoinDesk, adding that the university’s blockchain credentials will be “another way to practice what we preach.”  Student interest  in cryptocurrency has been on the rise nationwide, regardless of market trends.  Indeed, Andrew Hinkes, an adjunct professor at the New York University School of Law told CoinDesk that 80 students have already registered for the upcoming blockchain course at NYU, and registration is still open for another month. Demand for the course is so high it is now offered every semester.  Hinkes also receives weekly requests for academic lectures about regulation and cryptocurrency, compared to just a few annual requests in years past.  “When the value of these assets go down, there are people who have presumably lost money and therefore might want to sue,” Hinkes said. Speaking of the ICO boom in 2017, he added:  “That’s class-action defense, class-action prosecution and all sorts of civil and criminal litigation work emerging from this rush to obtain funding in ways that might not have been compliant, and all the regulatory and enforcement actions that we presume will come.”  Hinkes pointed out the statute of limitations is often up to five years and regulators have a habit of taking their time to build cases. As such, he expects there will be a boom in demand for blockchain-savvy legal services for years to come.  Continuing education  Hinkes also agreed with UNH’s Evans that lawyers will require a deep understanding of these digital systems in order to apply that knowledge across cases.  Evans said that in order “to hit that sweet spot between innovation and consumer protections,” lawyers in every industry will have to talk with their clients about how the law applies to various blockchain technologies, from bitcoin to smart contracts.  Although these two subjects – software development and law – may seem unrelated, Hinkes warned that misinformation based on a lack of technical expertise can be damaging for lawyers and their clients. As such, Hinkes said it is “increasingly common” for professionals to seek continuing education programs like UNH’s.  One such UNH student, nurse practitioner and attorney Lisa McGunnigle, told CoinDesk she wants to start incorporating her love of bitcoin into a law practice.  “Flexibility is a large factor, though overall the quality of the courses and the teachers was key,” she said, speaking to why online courses led by technologists are so appealing to working professionals.  Just like Hinkes, McGunnigle has noticed far more rigorous course options these days for learning about blockchain technology.  “There seems to be a potential for fine-tuning the legal relationships surrounding cryptocurrencies,” she said.

The news was announced Tuesday by the country’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which clarified that crypto businesses are regulated under the “Emergency Decree on Digital Asset Businesses B.E. 2561 (2018).”  The four firms receiving licenses include three crypto exchanges, Bitcoin Exchange, Bitkub Online, Satang Corporation (Satang Pro), and one crypto broker-dealer Coins TH Co., the SEC said.  Failing to win a license were Cash2coin and Southeast Asia Digital Exchange (SEADEX). The regulator said the two firms had not met the required standards – for example, custody systems and know-your-customer (KYC) processes were “inconsistent” and the effectiveness of their cybersecurity systems could not be verified.  As a result, Cash2coin and SEADEX will have to cease business operations by Jan. 14, and have been told to return clients’ assets under their custody, the SEC said. The firms can, however, reapply for the license provided the approval criteria are ultimately met.  Meanwhile, the SEC is still considering another application from a firm called Coin Asset. The company has made some executive changes which the SEC considers “material information” for license consideration. Until a decision is made, Coin Asset is permitted to carry out business operations.  Thailand first announced its crypto licensing rules in July of last year, with 20 crypto firms applying for the license within a month.

42402423,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdCg9n,1547118600,Bitcoin Price Slips Below $3.8K as Bullish Bets Tank,"Bitcoin is losing altitude as an unwinding of bullish bets is creating downward pressure on prices.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,780 on Bitstamp – down 5 percent on a 24-hour basis – having found offers above $4,000 at 06:00 UTC.  Notably, the price drop is accompanied by a decline in the bullish bets. For instance, the BTC/USD long positions on the Bitfinex exchange fell to an eight-day low of 31,237 earlier today and are currently down 8 percent at 31,255 – the biggest single-day drop since Dec. 19.  Further, the long-short ratio has pulled back to 1.35 from the five-month high of 1.5 reached yesterday, indicating waning bullish sentiment.  What's more interesting is that the ""long squeeze"" comes after repeated failure on the part of the bulls to clear the key resistance above $4,100. So, it seems safe to say that the demoralized bulls are exiting the market and that could attract sellers.  BTC/USD longs and shorts  As seen above, long positions have dropped sharply, while short positions are largely unchanged on the day. That said, today’s sell-off could entice the bears, leading to a rise in shorts and a deeper drop in prices.  Daily chart  The bearish doji reversal – back-to-back doji candles and a negative follow-through – seen in the above chart indicates that the recovery rally from the December low of $3,122 has stalled and the bears have regained some control.  Validating that argument is the breakdown of the trendline connecting the Dec. 28 low and Jan. 6 low. The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is also rolling over in favor of the bears.  Moreover, the failure on the part of the bulls to force an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout could be considered a strong bearish signal, especially since the bull flag breakout, witnessed in the 4-hour chart earlier this week, had set the stage for a break above $4,300.  As a result, BTC risks falling to the major support lined up at $3,566 (Dec. 27 low).  4-hour chart  With prices trading well below $3,934 (flag low), the bullish view put forward by the bull flag breakout on the 4-hour chart earlier this week is no longer valid.  View  The bearish doji reversal seen in the daily chart indicates an end of the recovery rally and has likely opened the doors to the bullish-higher low of $3,566 (Dec. 27 low). A break below that level would further strengthen the bear grip and allow a re-test of the December low of $3,122.  The confluence of the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline and the 50-day EMA, currently at $4,120, is the level to beat for the bulls. A high-volume break above that level would open up upside towards $5,000.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

A South China Morning Post report citing people with “knowledge of the matter” said Thursday that the “potential successor” of the firm’s current co-CEOs Jihan Wu and Micree Zhan is Haichao Wang, currently Bitmain's director of product engineering.  Wang has already taken over some of the leadership duties, while Wu and Zhan are expected to remain as chairmen and have the ""final call"" in the firm’s bigger decisions, according to the report.  Back in November, it was reported that Wu had been ousted from the board of BitMain Technologies Holding Company, the entity currently seeking to go public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX).  A Bitmain representative, however, at the time denied the board change, responding to a CoinDesk inquiry, stating: “There have been no board departures and co-founder Jihan Wu will continue to lead the company as co-chair, together with co-chief executive officer, Micree Zhan.”  Bitmain is still awaiting the Hong Kong Stock Exchange's (HKEX) approval for its initial public offering (IPO) application, filed in September of last year. The HKEX is apparently reluctant to green light the bid, however. Last month, a person involved in the talks told CoinDesk that the exchange is “very hesitant to actually approve these bitcoin mining companies because the industry is so volatile.”  The mining giant is also undergoing a series of business changes, including layoffs. Last month, more than 50 percent of Bitmain’s entire staff was reportedly asked to leave.

42402415,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdCg0w,1547110835,The First Live Enterprise Blockchain Sets Sights on Every Area of Global Trade,"In a space infamous for promising radical transformation but delivering mostly prototypes so far, Roberto Mancone, we.trade’s chief operating officer, has a record of making good on his pledges.  Early last year, he promised the trade finance blockchain platform would go live by mid-2018 – which it did, with a focus on trading between small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) in various European countries.  Later in the year, we.trade pledged it would make its first move outside Europe – which it did, announcing a project to explore interoperability with Hong Kong’s eTradeConnect and a move into Asia.  Enterprise blockchain watchers will also recall that Mancone predicted Batavia, the other trade finance blockchain built on Hyperledger Fabric, would probably join forces with we.trade. This more or less came to pass. Batavia no longer exists; out of its five banks, three decided to join we.trade. (All told, we.trade grew from seven shareholder banks to 12 over the course of last year and a total of 14 licensee banks.)  Given his prescience, then, it’s worth listening to what Mancone has to say about the year ahead. According to him, 2019 will be a year of forging partnerships for we.trade.  “As well as piling clients onto the platform, our goal is to continue extension in Asia and also develop some strategic partnerships outside of the financial market,” he told CoinDesk.  The goal of such tie-ups is to speed up the proliferation of the platform to new territories and also take it beyond the bank-backed aspects of trade finance, to ultimately create a convenient, frictionless user experience for clients involved in all areas of global trade. As Mancone put it:  ""The ultimate journey for the clients is not necessarily to work with one big player who does it all, but with a group of players that allow a seamless journey.""  Explaining we.trade's interest in linking up with eTradeConnect, Mancone said: “Instead of building something or licensing something, we wanted to see if we could connect to platforms that have similarities in terms of products because that will save a lot of time and energy.”  It should also be emphasized that simply getting a banking blockchain platform into production remains a rare feat these days. This makes we.trade something of a rock star, at least in the world of enterprise blockchain.  For 2019, the focus of geographic expansion will be “extended Asia,” which could possibly include Singapore, the southeast Pacific region and India, or the UAE, Mancone said. As far as timing on the Hong Kong PoC, Mancone said, “we expect to finish this test by end of Q1, and when we are comfortable we will attempt to move into production.”  Showing notable candor, Mancone also openly shared who he wants we.trade to partner with.  Prospective partners  One platform which Mancone has an eye on is IBM and Maersk’s supply chain DLT, TradeLens, which is also built using Hyperledger Fabric. Given the focus on global trade, and the fact that IBM is we.trade’s original development partner, some form of collaboration wouldn’t come as a huge surprise.  TradeLens has digitized documentation for the entire supply chain, while we.trade’s smart contracts automate and guarantee transactions between the banks of SMEs that are importing and exporting goods to one another.  With TradeLens, IBM and Maersk have already connected numerous customs and port authorities, carriers, freight and logistics firms all over the globe. Combining this with we.trade would be “a game-changer,” said Mancone.  “A project like TradeLens is, of course, extremely interesting for us. If you think about the ecosystem that we want to build, our platform is not a trade finance platform. It's a trade platform,” he said.  Mancone acknowledged that forming a partnership such as this would require serious talks, adding that “we are constantly monitoring each other and constantly having dialogue to understand at what stage these other projects are at.”  Apparently, the feeling is mutual. Todd Scott, the vice president of blockchain global trade at IBM told CoinDesk:  “TradeLens and we.trade both stand to transform their industries, and we believe there is significant potential and value in these platforms collaborating.""  Another platform proposition Mancone is watching is TradeShift, which simplifies payment and procurement across supply chains for large corporate clients, and which boasts some 1.5 million users on its network.  TradeShift, which did not respond to requests for comment by press time, has been relatively quiet regarding blockchain despite joining Hyperledger as a premier member in 2017.  “We have talked to them,” said Mancone. “TradeShift and we.trade would be a good fit in terms of their complementary roles. I guess when I mention 2019 as the year of partnerships, TradeShift could be one of the potential partners.”  Pointing to each platform’s specific capabilities, Mancone added,  “TradeLens is the digitization of the entire supply chain and documents. TradeShift is really procurement, while we have the conditional payments and smart contracts – so if you put all these pieces together, it's a good picture.”  Intellectual property  Stepping back, we.trade differs from other enterprise blockchain efforts because it is a company rather than a consortium. As such, its governance structure seems to be palatable to shareholder and licensee banks, while also allowing the platform to move more quickly than competitors.  As Mancone explained:  “We made it very clear that intellectual property is not owned by the banks. This is a big distinction between us and the other consortia. We are a legal entity and the IP is owned by the legal entity and it can be licensed to any other banks or partners without asking them to become shareholders. With currently 12 shareholder banks that means an average of almost 9% shares ownership.”  Mancone said the banks are content not to own the IP (provided their competitors don’t either), while still owning an equal share of the pie.  “Everybody that's interested in the company or believes that the company can be of benefit can become a shareholder; it’s not limited, the number of shareholders,” he said. “This creates better acceptance because we put them all at the same level in terms of features, functionality and the platform that we provide.”  Moving swiftly towards production is a good reason to avoid the traditional consortia model where a lot of time is spent around a table, possibly with lawyers present. However, we.trade’s approach is also a significant departure from TradeLens, where the IP is divided between Maersk and IBM, something of an obstacle when it comes to getting other shipping carriers to join the network.  At the moment we.trade’s development is outsourced to IBM, which also provides its private cloud architecture. Mancone said this is because “we want to have a very light company with a very strong partner to start and more partners to come.”  But he said going forward the company is hiring tech expertise and the plan is also to create an API infrastructure so that fintech firms can tap into the platform and help enhance it.  He said this would reduce the dependency on one vendor and foster the creation of an ecosystem. In terms of forming deeper partnerships with IBM, Mancone said there are clear differences between components or activities developed by Big Blue, which it holds the IP for, and the we.trade platform itself.  “But the entire platform that is built, as it is built, that is the IP of we.trade,” he said. “So there is clearly a differentiation between the IP owned by IBM, which are the single components that allow us to build the platform, and the platform itself which is the we.trade IP.”  Roberto Mancone image courtesy of CPI Media Group",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/01/10/the-first-live-enterprise-blockchain-sets-sights-on-every-area-of-global-trade,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6158653f39e7b6cb9f879731d50f6b8d0d6ae960-1200x687.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402421,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdCg6q,1547096436,"Crypto Mining Malware Has Netted Nearly 5% of All Monero, Says Research","Monero (XMR) is by far the most popular cryptocurrency among criminals deploying mining malware, according to a new study.  Two researchers, Sergio Pastrana and Guillermo Suarez-Tangil, from Universidad Carlos III de Madrid and King’s College London, respectively, published their report last week, estimating that hackers have mined at least 4.32 percent of the total monero in circulation.  Pastrana and Suarez-Tangil write:  “Overall, we estimate there are at least 2,218 active campaigns that have accumulated about 720K XMR (57M USD). Interestingly just a single campaign (C#623) has mined more than 163K XMR (18M USD), which accounts for about 23% of the total estimated. This campaign is still active at the time of writing.""  The researchers, however, are not sure whether, or what portion, of malware owners have cashed out their crypto, due to lack of information and the fluctuating prices of cryptos. At press time, the value of the XMR total cited is almost $40 million.  Around 4.4 million malware samples were analyzed over a 12-year period from 2007 to 2018, and and 1 million malicious miners were identified, the paper says.  Tactics adopted to distribute malware varies, but the pair say that a ""common yet effective approach is to use legitimate infrastructure such as Dropbox or GitHub to host the droppers, and stock mining tools such as claymore and xmrig to do the actual mining.""  After monero, which the pair said is ""most prevalent,"" bitcoin came in at second favorite crypto for illicit mining, though its popularity has decreased over the years. Bad actors also experimented with other altcoins such as dogecoin or litecoin during 2013 and 2014 and then shifted back to bitcoin and monero, probably because these are more profitable, the researchers suggest.  Of the malware-associated wallets identified by the team, monero was 56 percent more represented than bitcoin, while zcash came in third place.  More generally, instances of crypto-mining malware increased by well over 4,000 percent last year, according to research from McAfee published in December – growth that saw it rapidly overtake the previous favorite, ransomware, over the period.  Back in November, research from Israel-based cybersecurity firm Check Point Software Technologies showed that a monero mining malware, dubbed KingMiner, is evolving through time to avoid detection.
