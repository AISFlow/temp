42430996,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzCVh,1569443700,Emsisoft Releases Bug Fix for Bitcoin-Ransoming Malware WannaCryFake,"Software firm Emsisoft released a bug fix for the bitcoin-ransoming malware WannaCryFake.  Announced today in a blog post, the free software will help recover encrypted files without leading to data loss.  Unlike real crypto-mining exploits, ransomware is dependent on extortion to reap a reward. Ransomware attacks increased 118 percent in 2019, equaling 504 new threats per minute, in the first quarter, according to a McAfee report.  WannaCryFake is a variant of the infamous WannaCry ransomware that targeted Microsoft computers in 2017. It locks victims‚Äô files using AES-256, or the advanced encryption standard.  An infected victim will receive a message that says:  ‚ÄúYou have to pay for decryption in bitcoins. The price depends on how fast you write to us. After payment we will send you the tool that will decrypt all your files.‚Äù  Victims are instructed to contact the ransomware distributors through ProtonMail or Telegram, and are then provided steps on how to send bitcoin through Pidgin.  Though the virus suggests LocalBitcoin‚Äôs as the ‚Äúeasiest way to buy bitcoin,‚Äù it also sources CoinDesk‚Äôs beginners' guide to bitcoin for users unfamiliar with the digital currency.  The malware also warns, ‚ÄúDecryption of your files with the help of third parties may cause increased price (they add their fee to our) or you can become a victim of a scam.‚Äù  Once downloaded, the Emsisoft Decryptor uses the encrypted file and the original unencrypted version to piece together the keys needed to decrypt locked data. Because the protocol uses filename extensions to determine the encryption parameters, users are instructed not to rename their files.  Emsisoft‚Äôs software allows users to keep a record of the decryption process by using the Save Log button.  In addition to an increase in bitcoin ransoming malware,¬†crypto-jacking scams are up 29 percent in the first half of 2019, despite the difficulty in mining due to bitcoin‚Äôs increasing hash rate.

42431031,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzD1h,1569418215,WATCH: Inside a Siberian Crypto Mining Complex,"In Siberia, cheap hydropower, cold climate, and abandoned Soviet industrial infrastructure has made the region of Irkutsk an attractive spot for urban explorers and, more importantly, crypto miners.  In the city of Bratsk lies one of the largest hydropower plants in Russia. The massive dam and generator feeds the region's growing mining farms. Cheap electricity is actively attracting miners from all parts of the world, turning the region into an international mining hub.  In addition to the cheap electricity, the local climate is favorable to miners: the average annual temperature in Bratsk is 28 degrees Celsius or 82.4 ‚Ñâ. The warm season (meaning when it‚Äôs not freezing) lasts four or five months a year and the rest of the time it's a deep freeze.  Another advantage is the plethora of empty buildings left by the Soviet factories that didn't survive Russia's turn to a market economy.  Now some of those buildings, with the electricity already plugged in, have made the leap from the industrial to post-industrial age, becoming homes for mining hardware. In these remote areas, the miners can gobble up hydropower without disturbing the neighbors.  Three companies, Bitriver, Cryptoreactor, and Minery, are the biggest players here offering ""mining hotels,"" or venues to place ASICs equipped the cooling systems, tech support teams and security guards.  Bitriver boasts 100 megawatt of power available for clients while Cryptoreactor said it had secured 40 megawatts and Minery claims 30 megawatt. The venues are currently hosting machines from the clients in the U.S., Russia, Japan, Korea, Brazil, Lithuania, India, Poland, Spain, China, and other countries.  At one of Minery's two farms, for example, 26 massive shipping containers host ASICs owned by the miners from the U.S., Russia, Korea, India, Japan and Spain, the firm's CEO Ilya Bruman said.  Dmitry Ozersky, CEO of Eletro.Farm, a mining company building a large venue in Kazakhstan, believes bitcoin mining farms across Russia now wield a joint capacity of 600 megawatts, accounting for almost 10 percent of the total 7 gigawatts of power supporting the bitcoin network worldwide.

Reeves said that capital will go towards cementing partnerships, both in the cryptocurrency and retail space.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be rolling out subscription options for merchants and consumers soon that will provide premium services and highest rewards,‚Äù Reeves said, adding:  ‚ÄúWhen people spend fiat at retailers they will receive BTC rewards.

A mobile Fold App with the full features currently available via desktop, Reeves added, is slated for launch in October. Until then, the mobile app is also available to users that sign up through Fold‚Äôs website for early access.  CoinShares co-founder Meltem Demirors told CoinDesk Fold App is unique, compared to other retail-focused bitcoin apps, because it encourages users to use non-custodial wallets.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm excited to work not only with Fold, but also with our community of portfolio companies, corporate partners, and other service providers to build an integrated user experience around bitcoin payments,‚Äù she said.

Fold App is already integrated with two lightning-friendly wallets, BlueWallet and Breez.

We‚Äôre placing our bets on different types of applications and models and learning from them. Supporting startups that experiment with how to drive adoption is one of our priorities.""  Lolli told CoinDesk in July that it, too, was planning to eventually add lightning options. So it remains to be seen how the retail app race will play out.  In the meantime, Fold is offering a type of crypto training wheels to retailers like Macy‚Äôs, Target and Amazon. On the merchant side, they only see a payment processed by Fold, not the users‚Äô credit card or bitcoin wallet address. This offers more privacy than directly shopping via the merchant‚Äôs website. Fold then cashes out the payment for merchants, which typically choose to receive the value in fiat.  ‚ÄúWe can settle in fiat or bitcoin, yet all major merchants choose to settle in fiat now so they don‚Äôt take volatility risk or accounting overhead,‚Äù Reeves said, adding:  ‚ÄúFold can seamlessly transition them when they are ready because we are already directly integrated into their point-of-sale systems.‚Äù  Macy's image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/25/bitcoin-shopping-app-fold-raises-25-million-to-bring-lightning-to-retailers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e930632b562dfa391900a8b408790e58bd5df6fa-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Led by early Coinbase employee¬†Nick Tomaino, the firm's first fund, focused on seed rounds, amounted to $26 million.  ""We wanted to start off relatively small, prove out the model and raise more capital if the model was working,"" Tomaino told CoinDesk in an email. ""The model is working well and we had strong support from our existing [limited partner] base to launch a larger second fund.""  He says he's broadly optimistic about the crypto industry. In a blog post shared with CoinDesk in advance, Tomaino wrote:  ""Today, the current total market value of crypto assets is ~$272B and investment/speculation is the only mainstream use case. We think in the next five years, that total market value will surpass $1T as the investment/speculation use case continues to grow and other mainstream use cases emerge.""  1confirmation has invested in a wide array of new companies in the industry, including¬†BloXroute, Tendermint,¬†OpenSea and Commonwealth.¬†The firm invests in both startup equity and cryptocurrency tokens.  While Tomaino declined to detail participants in the new fund, he noted that it is ""largely backed by our existing Fund I LPs."" When 1confirmation was first announced, limited partners included:¬†Peter Thiel, Marc Andreessen, Balaji Srinivasan, Brendan Eich, Runa Capital and Real Ventures, among others.  This larger fund will allow for the company to write larger checks while continuing to capitalize on being close to pioneers in the space, Tomaino told CoinDesk.  He wrote in an email:  ""For Fund I, our focus was providing early stage capital for founders building infrastructure and middleware for the decentralized web. For Fund II, we're continuing that focus with larger checks as a result of the larger fund (Fund II checks are generally between $1M and $2M, where Fund I checks were between $250K and $1M).""  In his blog post, Tomaino emphasizes the importance of not chasing the trend so much as investing in ""focused, disciplined, mission-driven founders."" Further, he¬†predicts that bitcoin will continue to be the market leader and that ethereum will follow close behind, particularly as the platform for decentralized finance.  Tomaino writes:  ""While the story for ETH as a store of value is not as strong as the story for BTC as a store of value and a lot of Ethereum infrastructure challenges remain unsolved, we think that Ethereum as a platform for innovation is here to stay and ETH‚Äôs future as Internet money for open, inclusive financial products (aka DeFi) is bright.""

42382739,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sjzn,1569410101,Bitcoin Price Risks Drop to $7.5K After Third Biggest Daily Loss of 2019,"View  BTC looks set to test support near $7,500, having confirmed a bearish reversal with a high-volume triangle breakdown on Tuesday.  The cryptocurrency's violation of the historically strong 55-candle exponential moving average (MA) on the¬†three-day chart also favors a deeper price slide.  The outlook would turn bullish if prices quickly rise above Tuesday's high of $9,782, although that looks unlikely at press time.      Bitcoin fell sharply on Tuesday, confirming a bearish reversal and opening the doors for a test of crucial price support near $7,500.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value ran into selling pressure around $9,700 in the early U.S. trading hours and fell to a 3.5-month low of $7,998 at 19:45 UTC on Bitstamp.  BTC had been on slippery ground following Tuesday's volatility band breakdown. A widely-followed indicator was also reporting the strongest a bear bias in nine months, as discussed earlier this week.  The price slide was likely exacerbated by a¬†long squeeze, when investors square off (or sell) long positions to cut losses in a falling market, thereby creating further downward pressure on prices.  So, while a price drop was expected, the magnitude of the sell-off has caught many by surprise. The cryptocurrency fell by 11.83 percent on Tuesday ‚Äì 2019's third-biggest single-day drop, as per Bitstamp data.  BTC has seen double-digit daily losses four times this year.  The biggest single-day loss of 2019 witnessed on June 27 marked a healthy correction from a 17-month high of $13,880 reached on the preceding day.  The latest double-digit price slide has taken the cryptocurrency below major support levels. Therefore, a deeper drop toward $7,500 ‚Äì a level seen a week ahead of Facebook's launch of Libra ‚Äì could be seen over the next few days.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands around $8,400 on Bitstamp. It's worth noting the cryptocurrency is still up about 127 percent on a year-to-date basis.  Daily and monthly charts  Bitcoin dived out a three-month contracting triangle on Tuesday (above left), confirming an end of the bull market, which had started from April's low near $4,000.  Currently, prices are flirting with the 200-day moving average (MA) support at $8,309. That long-term MA has come into play for the first time since April and will likely be breached, as the post-triangle breakdown price drop looks to have legs ‚Äì volumes hit three-month highs on Tuesday.  BTC, therefore, risks extending losses to support at $7,500 ‚Äì lows seen before Libra hype gripped the market in mid-June  Moreover, the triangle breakdown could yield a drop to $4,000 (target as per the measured move method), as tweeted by bitcoin skeptic and CEO of Euro Pacific Capital Peter Schiff.¬†That target looks far-fetched, however.  The monthly chart (above right) is also now teasing a bearish reversal. The cryptocurrency charted inside-bar candlestick patterns in the previous two months, signaling an impending bullish-to-bearish trend change.  The outlook as per the monthly chart would turn bearish only if prices close below $9,049 (first inside bar's low) on Sept. 30. That looks likely, with prices currently trading at $8,400 and the daily chart reporting a strong bearish setup.  The bearish case would weaken if prices find acceptance above $9,097 ‚Äì a higher high created on May 30.¬†The outlook would turn bullish if prices bounce from the 200-day MA and chart a quick V-shaped recovery to levels above Tuesday's high of $9,782. That, however, looks unlikely.  3-day chart  BTC has found acceptance below the 55-candle exponential moving average, which served as a strong base during the 2016-2017 bull market.  Back then, the cryptocurrency charted bullish higher lows along the key EMA and not once did the sellers managed to secure a close below the crucial support.  Hence, the latest close below the 55-candle EMA could be considered a strong bearish development.  Oversold daily RSI  The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is currently hovering below 23, its lowest level since November 2018. A reading below 30 indicates oversold conditions and suggests scope for a corrective bounce.  That said, indicators can and do remain oversold for a prolonged period in a strong bearish market, especially when a sell-off is preceded by a major bout of consolidation. BTC was trapped in a narrow range for almost three months before breaking lower.  In such situations, seasoned trades consider an oversold reading on the RSI as an indicator of trend strength. So, expecting a notable price bounce on the basis of the oversold reading on the RSI could prove costly.  Disclosure:¬†The author holds no cryptocurrency assets¬†at the time of writing.

The pilot commercial trade transaction saw the firm ‚Äì which owns Mercedes-Benz among other brands ‚Äì process the data required to¬†exchange payments with engineering firm and parts builder¬†D√ºrr, according to a press release sent to CoinDesk on Wednesday. German bank Landesbank Baden-W√ºrttemberg (LBBW) was also involved in the trade.  The pilot involved an order and delivery agreement for a balancing system from D√ºrr subsidiary Schenck arranged over Marco Polo. Payment was prearranged through a conditional commitment from Daimler's bank.  Once¬†the ordered equipment was delivered, the fulfillment data was entered onto Marco Polo and automatically reconciled with the agreed transaction data, thus triggering an irrevocable payment obligation.  Founded by startups R3 and TradeIX, Marco Polo is built on R3‚Äôs Corda blockchain platform. The network aims to deliver real-time connectivity, boost transparency in trading relationships and lower barriers to accessing capital.  Currently, arranging traditional paper-based payments for international trade transactions is inefficient and and slow, requiring multiple systems and a number of intermediaries such as logistics providers, insurers, customs authorities, according to LBBW's announcement.  The pilot ‚Äì conducted in ""minutes instead of days"" ‚Äì had persuaded D√ºrr and Daimler that blockchain can make the process ""faster and simpler,"" said the bank.  Susanne Schlegel, CFO of Schenck and D√ºrr Division Measuring and Process Systems, said:  ‚ÄúWe focus on efficiency increases not only with regard to our machines and systems, but also to our business processes. The successful pilot project between Daimler and LBBW demonstrates the intrinsic efficiency potential of digital trade finance processes.¬†Innovative platforms and technologies such as Marco Polo and Corda allow us to reduce complexities in order fulfillment ‚Äì to the benefit of all participants""  The ability to automatically trigger payments was a milestone for the network, announced in August. Marco Polo's first such transaction involved LBBW and Commerzbank and saw¬†logistics provider Logwin AG adding data to the blockchain to initiate the payment obligation.

A company of 10 employees, many from traditional finance, London-based Skew is building out features for institutional clients to visualize historical data as well as create dashboards and is hiring in engineering and eventually in distribution.  ‚ÄúWhere we want to focus is on corporates and institutions that need this data to run their business,‚Äù Skew CEO and co-founder Emmanuel Goh told CoinDesk. ‚ÄúWe have had heard concerns from interested traders and firms, and they would be able to generate backtest strategies from this data.‚Äù  Goh and his co-founder Tim Noat worked as traders of flow derivatives and exotic options at JPMorgan Chase and Citi, respectively, before starting the company.  The firm‚Äôs analytics tools resemble the institutional-grade tools one would find for established products such as foreign exchange and equity, Monica Desai, an investing partner at Kleiner Perkins, told CoinDesk by email.  ‚ÄúAs a former trader I‚Äôve found many of their tools (some forthcoming) to feel the most trading floor-native or Bloomberg-esque and am excited to see how they evolve the product as the crypto derivatives space grows exponentially in the next year,‚Äù said Desai, who used to manage bond portfolios at JPMorgan.  Derivatives' day  Crypto derivatives took off in 2018 after the brutal market correction of 2017 and are showing a resurgence driven by institutional adoption, Goh said.  Swaps are being traded in the billions every day on offshore venues, and regulated entities are ramping up offerings. For example, CME plans to launch bitcoin options in Q1 2019 and Intercontinental Exchange‚Äôs bitcoin futures platform Bakkt debuted Monday (though it didn‚Äôt domuch volume).  ‚ÄúBakkt is the first time large institutions can build physical coins,‚Äù Goh said, referring to the fact that the futures contracts are settled in real bitcoin rather than cash. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be a moment of proof for the industry.‚Äù  While crypto derivatives markets are fragmented, Skew has contracted a number of licensing agreements with crypto exchanges.  According to Skew‚Äôs data, aggregated bitcoin options have grown more than sixfold from last year‚Äôs fourth quarter to $34.8 million this quarter.

42382729,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sjlx,1569390651,Barclays Hackathon to Attack Data ‚ÄòSilos‚Äô With Blockchain,"Barclays is holding another hackathon to tackle the financial services industry‚Äôs perennial problem of systems that don‚Äôt talk to each other. Once again, blockchain will take center stage.  The second annual DerivHack 2019 will take place October 16-17 in Barclays‚Äô Rise accelerator spaces in London and New York, sites of last year‚Äôs 48-hour coding marathon, and in the megabank‚Äôs Singapore office this time as well. The event is outgrowing its name, as equities and bonds will be added to the mix of financial instruments involved.  As in previous years, the aim of the hackathon is to explore ways the International Swaps and Derivatives Association‚Äôs (ISDA) Common Domain Model (CDM) can be implemented using various programming languages and applied to a range of platforms, including blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT).  About 50 teams of four coders each, representing banks, financial infrastructure providers and financial technology firms, will compete to produce the best solutions. There will be four to six judges at each of the three locations, comprising senior representatives from Barclays, other banks, market infrastructures, trade associations, and universities. Three prizes will be awarded at each of the three locations for first, second and third place.  In addition to ISDA, Barclays has assembled a range of partners to support the hackathon, including the likes of R3 for Corda platform support and Digital Asset for DAML programming support. Other partners include DBS Bank in Singapore, U.S. central securities depository DTCC, the International Capital Market Association (ICMA), and REGnosys, a post-trade platform tailored to the CDM. Plus, Big Four audit firm EY will produce an independent report on the event. Teams looking to participate can sign up here.  Sunil Challa from the Business Architect team at Barclays talked through some of the philosophy behind the event, pointing out that product classes within financial services have evolved organically over time and so banks, buy-side firms and utilities had to support the growth through product-specific solutions.  Challa told CoinDesk:  ‚ÄúThe idea is to demonstrate through the CDM that these [products] can actually co-mingle and a standard can cut across them to direct the industry in terms of cross-asset, cross-product solutions rather than siloed investments.‚Äù  Challa said the hackathon will also help Barclays (and other banks) evaluate the CDM against their internal models and weigh up variations such as applications using CDM natively, shared repositories of data in CDM format, and even hybrid models.  ‚ÄúThe hackathon is like a capsule of accelerated industry feedback, achieving in two intense days what may otherwise take years to occur organically,‚Äù he said.  Lingua franca  Dr. Lee Braine from the Chief Technology and Innovation Office at Barclays said that staff from across the bank were supporting the event, bringing together its strategy, business architecture, technology, innovation, and delivery teams. This even included a Barclays summer intern writing a program to generate the test trades that will be used as input data by the hackathon participants.  ‚ÄúThey constructed a market model with corresponding business process, use cases and test data in order to allow hackathon participants to work on challenges that are truly at the leading edge of best practice thinking,‚Äù Braine said  Teams will be free to choose whatever technology platform they prefer (not only the ones supporting the event) and this will also inform the sorts of languages they might select, he said. For instance, people may want to use Java or Kotlin to code workflows on Corda.  Or they may choose DAML to code rights and obligations in a domain-specific language, working at a high level of abstraction that could even be independent of whether there happens to be a distributed ledger or a centralized database underneath. Alternatively, teams could opt for another blockchain platform, such as Hyperledger Fabric or ethereum, or a more traditional software stack.  ‚ÄúThere are pros and cons with all programming languages and platforms, and we think it will be the same here. Factors are likely to include the speed of development; the elegance and simplicity of the solution, understandability, robustness, and so on.‚Äù  The idea behind the ISDA CDM, said Braine, is to establish a common standard for post-trade business logic and data that is agnostic of any specific technology, permitting the standard to be implemented in potentially any programming language on any platform.  Since many banks are looking for third party utilities to take on more post-trade processing tasks, the more standardization that can be brought to the space, the better, he said, concluding:  ‚ÄúOnce you get agreement on the event processes and data structures, that solves most of the problem. The next question is then around which platform and which programming language - well that's a key point of the hackathon.‚Äù  Barclays pic: Shutterstock",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/09/25/barclays-hackathon-to-attack-data-silos-with-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/71ae8b6be43aeb95b9a2ce9a1ed79ca8bbc61242-1900x1268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382741,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sk13,1569384048,Bakkt's Slow Start Doesn't Mean Bitcoin Futures Have Flopped,"Galen Moore is a member of the CoinDesk Research team. The opinions expressed in this article are the author‚Äôs own.  The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a weekly newsletter focused on institutional investment in crypto assets.¬†Sign up for free here.      It's a lively time for bitcoin derivatives ‚Äì or at least for those writing about them. For those trading them, it may be business as usual.  The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) announced Friday it is preparing to offer options trades on its bitcoin futures contract. It's a surprising move, because options volume to date rounds to zero, as a percentage of reported volume in futures and swaps.  Still, nobody in crypto has had an options counterparty as reliable as CME before.  The announcement gives CME a way to offer options without having to build much anew. Why should it? CME's bitcoin futures market represents a tiny percentage of its overall volume.  Nevertheless, CME may be feeling a shade of anxiety about its leadership position in regulated crypto derivatives markets, with Bakkt rolling out a regulated bitcoin futures contract this week that, unlike the Chicago exchange's, is settled in actual bitcoin rather than cash.  After all, other people in Chicago who trade a lot of bitcoin seem to think physically settled futures are important. Maybe CME's announcement lets it steal a little of Bakkt's thunder.  Speaking of Bakkt, its October 2019 monthly and daily contracts launched Monday. First-day volume in the monthly contract was just 71 BTC. That's rather anemic, compared with the start of the CME product in December 2017, which isn't necessarily apples to apples, given CME futures launched near bitcoin's all-time highs.  The Bakkt one-day futures contract is the more intriguing product of the two. It could be anything from a CFTC-regulated fiat onramp to a duplicate of the popular BitMEX perpetual swap, if traders use its T+2 settlement to build a forward curve and continue to roll the contracts.  So far, traders aren't. Volume in Bakkt's one-day futures was all of 2 BTC on Monday.  Persistent myth  The first regulated bitcoin futures came in December 2017, just before bitcoin's price began a long slide down 83 percent from its all-time high. With volumes under $100 million, however, it would be hard to argue that futures trading brought sanity to the markets.  Instead, it's more likely that slow demand for the new product punctured the myth of institutional demand for bitcoin exposure, pent up behind compliance departments' insistence on a regulated product.  That myth is alive and well today among retail-focused crypto ""analysts,"" as a search for ""bakkt volume fail"" will show you. If you were around in 2017, you didn't need time travel to know to¬†short bitcoin on Monday: you had seen this movie before. Even the least-sober among us in 2019 recognize the obvious, that institutional investors' interest in bitcoin is developing slowly, when it is developing at all.  For institutional investors, derivatives offer readily understood solutions to operational obstacles related to custody, investability and risk. (Regulated bitcoin futures are structured the same as futures in, say, frozen concentrated orange juice.)  Still, today the lion's share of the volume is on unregulated exchanges that don't operate as clearinghouses and offer leverage up to 100X.  These products could not be interesting to any regulated asset manager, but they are interesting.  Despite persistent doubts as to the reliability of their reported volumes (especially with OKEx and Huobi), bitcoin traders on the largest over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks know there is liquidity in these markets. Their hedging strategies rely on that liquidity.  Other than that, volume on these leveraged trades is probably all crypto hedge funds and, as one trader put it to me, ""degenerate gamblers,"" trading on their own accounts.  Bitcoin futures are structured much like orange juice concentrate futures, but everyone knows that orange juice concentrate, when mixed with more volatile things can become rather flammable. There are important qualities that set bitcoin apart from other asset categories and these qualities of the underlying are taken into account by institutional investors evaluating bitcoin derivatives.  For example, there may not be natural hedges in a bitcoin futures market. If you don't believe that, compare global operating expenditure for gold miners to those of bitcoin miners. This isn't Kansas.  Road ahead  Derivatives may be gold bricks paving the road to institutional investment in bitcoin, but it's a long way to the Emerald City. Right now, the CME futures volume is as good a guide as any to investors' progress along that road.  You may have seen charts showing the rise in CME volumes in May. That rise also coincided with a twofold increase in the price of bitcoin. Measured in bitcoin terms, CME futures volume surged in July and is now back trading at a modest growth rate over Q1 levels.  Meanwhile, no fewer than four other startups are readying new derivatives offerings for the U.S. institutional and other regulated markets. All are focused on physical settlement.  It remains to be seen whether physical delivery will be a feature that compels market participation. It's not always very important in derivatives built on other asset categories.  One thing appears certain: no new financial instrument is likely to ""unlock"" institutional demand, as most institutions are only beginning to answer the question of why they would invest in bitcoin in the first place.  (Thanks to the team at www.sk3w.co for their data and input.)  This analysis draws on a forthcoming white paper on the state of crypto-asset derivatives.

42382737,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sjxH,1569374821,Bitcoin Dips Below $8K in First Since June,"Bitcoin (BTC) has once again shocked investors after a sharp sell-off Tuesday saw it quickly drop $1,000 in value during a single trading session.  Over the course of 30 minutes, beginning at 16:00 UTC on Sept 24, prices dipped below $8,000 -- its lowest point since June 12 of this year. In addition, $30 billion has been drawn out of the market over a 24-hour period as investors sought to close their positions amid a frenzied sell-off.  Eyes are now firmly fixed on the 200-day moving average (MA) that would officially mark the start of a new bear market should a strong close below $8,311 occur.  The price drop may have been exacerbated by margin calls and contract liquidations on Bitmex, according to a previous report by CoinDesk.  In any case, BTC's 2019 bull market hangs on a thread.  As can be seen above, BTC has begun to break down from a bearish descending triangle¬†that had been noted by a large portion of the crypto Twitter community since as early as Sept 2.  Further, the $1,000 price drop flies in the face of Bakkt's recent futures launch, which was supposed to be a bullish catalyst but has so far fallen short of expectations.  Technicals point to the possibility of a short-term bounce, courtesy of an extreme oversold RSI on the daily chart and weaker histogram bars below 0. However, a measured move (the drawdown from peak to trough within the triangle) adds scope for a continuation to prior June 2018 supports near $6,100.  Pressure is on buyers to hold the defensive and retain the official bullish status above the 200-day moving average at $8,311.  All prices below that point would add credence to a new bear market for the remainder of 2019.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writing.
