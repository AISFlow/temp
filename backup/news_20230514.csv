Recently, investors have become increasingly concerned about the US debt ceiling, with US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen setting a deadline of June 1st. As a result, the markets continue to fear the worst. The crypto market is not exempt from the bearishness being experienced by the markets. According to CoinGecko, the total market cap of crypto declined nearly 3% as major cryptocurrencies continue to slip after a month of compounding gains.

On May 11 and May 12, the Beacon chain, the consensus layer of the Ethereum network, was unable to reach finality on two occasions. The first occurrence lasted for 25 minutes, and the second for over an hour. Although the exact cause of such an incident is yet unknown, it is worth stating that this network glitch had no impact on on-chain activity and transactions were still processed. Related Reading: Tether Holds $3.4 Billion In Gold Reserves, Nears ATH Market Cap 1 Year Post Terra Collapse Ethereum Developers Roll Out Network Patches To Tackle Finality Challenge In response to the past week, Ethereum developers have released patches to provide a solution for network users. According to a tweet by Beacom Chain community health analyst superphiz, Teku and Prysm, two of Ethereum‚Äôs constitutional clients, have implemented these fixes, which will help prevent further finality issues on the Beacon chain. Superphiz also shared a statement from the Ethereum Foundation in which they are speculating the cause of these ‚Äúexceptional scenarios‚Äù to be the ‚Äúhigh load of some Consensus Layer clients‚Äù. The Ethereum Foundation applauded client diversity which made it feasible for transactions to occur on the network, as not all client implementations were affected by the finality challenges. The Ethereum Foundation also confirmed that the exact cause of the Beacon chain glitch is still unknown. However, they provided assurances that the upgrades implemented by Teku and Prsym would help avoid future occurrences via optimizations that will prevent beacon nodes from high resource usage during these situations. Related Reading: BRISE Gains 21% In 24 Hours ‚Äì Could This Be A Market Recovery? ETH Total Supply Declines Following The Merge In other news, Ethereum‚Äôs total supply decreased in the months after The Merge. On September 15, 2022, The Merge occurred in which the Ethereum network fully transitioned from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), leading to Ethereum 2.0. In the 241 days after this historical event, data from the Ethereum supply analytics platform, ultrasound.money shows that ETH‚Äôs total supply has declined by 0.29%. Source: ultrasound.money Since The Merge, over 653,000 ETH has been burned compared to the 425,000 ETH that has been minted in the last eight months resulting in a net negative change of about -227,000 ETH. Interestingly, ultrasound.money predicts the total ETH supply to have increased at a rate of 3.244% per year had The Merge not occurred. That said, if this deflationary trend continues, it would mean good news for long-term ETH investors. This is because a decrease in supply usually results in a rise in value. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $1,805.77 with a total supply of 122.89 million.

Related Reading: BRISE Gains 21% In 24 Hours ‚Äì Could This Be A Market Recovery? KAVA Price Overview Recently, the KAVA token has been on a positive price rally, gaining more than 30% of its value in the last seven days. For long-term investors, this may be seen as some form of recovery, as the coin had not been performing well until a week ago. To put this into perspective, the token has only increased by 1.6% in the past month. In fact, up until the 8th of May, the price of KAVA was on a steady decline, losing nearly 29% of its value in three weeks. That said, an upward price movement that started a week ago has seen the token climb up to its previous high of $0.96. As of this writing, KAVA is valued at $0.969, tallying a 4.7% increase in 24 hours. KAVAUSD trading at $0.9754 | Source: KAVAUSD chart from TradingView This latest price increase has been linked to the upcoming upgrade on the mainnet. Scheduled for 17th May, 2023 (15:00 UTC), the ‚ÄúKava 13‚Äù upgrade aims to bring architectural enhancements to the security, scalability, and functionality of the network. Consequently, this will help developers to scale and accelerate their protocols and improve user experience across the ecosystem. According to CoinGecko data, KAVA has a market capitalization of $495.5 million, which places it as the 90th largest cryptocurrency in the market. It is, however, worth noting that the token‚Äôs daily trading volume has dipped by 51.7% to $21.9 million in the last 24 hours. Kava Submits Proposal To Initiate ‚ÄòHorizon‚Äô On May 13, 2023, Kava advanced its plans to implement the first phase of the Kava Horizon. Codenamed ‚ÄúProposal 141‚Äù, the proposal to initiate this change is now live for community voting. This proposal, if approved, will permanently end all emissions (including POS rewards, Rise rewards, grants, and other reward emissions) by December 31, 2023. However, before this is implemented, two independent foundations will be created to oversee the steady development and maintenance of the permissionless and decentralized blockchain. These two foundations will receive the bulk of emissions till they eventually cease at the end of the year. A future software upgrade ‚Äì launched subsequent to proposal 141 ‚Äì will control the flow of all accumulated rewards from the aforementioned foundations.

BSV has scored 10% price gains on the weekly chart. The coin gained 2.47% on the last day, showing a 0.57% price increase in the previous hour. With today‚Äôs performance, Bitcoin SV joined the list of top-performing coins over the past timeframe and might be nearing $40. Bitcoin SV Back In The Spotlight Bitcoin SV was created in 2018 due to a hard fork from Bitcoin Cash led by the controversial Craig Wright. The idea was to create a blockchain that could process transactions faster with a larger block size limit, a major bottleneck for Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin. In addition, BSV has incorporated Ethereum-like capabilities such as native tokens, smart contracts, and other features to ensure interoperability within its blockchain. However, the token has failed to gain the sort of adoption it envisaged and hit an all-time low on May 8, bottoming at $29.17. But a series of events in the Bitcoin ecosystem has made the controversial token jump into the limelight. Related Reading: Coinbase Engages Legal And Political Aids In Battling SEC Top among these is the congestion on the Bitcoin network caused by Ordinals NFT and BRC-20 tokens. Bitcoin SV supporters believe its high transaction throughput and low transaction fees make it a better blockchain than Bitcoin, and the numbers support it. Currently, the average transaction fee on BSV is about $0.035, while average Bitcoin fees have spiked to $31.50 as more users jump on the BRC-20 token trend. This has led to a debate in the Bitcoin community, with advocates for increasing the block size growing louder. This move has been rebuffed by core Bitcoin maximalists who believe that increasing this capacity would lead to greater centralization ‚Äì As fewer people can run a node that operates using higher bandwidth. This could be Bitcoin SV‚Äôs gain as proponents believe it could provide an excellent alternative and fulfil llSatoshi Nakamoto‚Äôs dream of a peer-to-peer electronic money system as outlined in the original Bitcoin whitepaper. Related Reading: Ripple CTO Labels BEN Coin As Scam, Bitboy Reacts Bitcoin SV Price Analysis At the time of writing, Bitcoin SV is trading at $35.98, and if the bullish momentum continues, BSV could target $40 in the coming days. However, before reaching the $40 target, Bitcoin SV bulls may encounter an intermediate hurdle in the $37-$39 range. However, before reaching the $0.60 target, the bulls may encounter an intermediate hurdle in the $0.57 to $0.58 range. The SMA 20 is in the buy zone, which could indicate that investors are looking to accumulate more of the token, which is a bullish sign.

Related Reading: PEPE Attempts Market Rebound, Surges By 28% In 24 Hours Coinbase engaged a Global Advisory Council for the battle with the SEC. The council comprises heavy hitters from both the political and legal sectors. Coinbase Gets Heavyweights In Its Council The Coinbase crypto exchange announced the launch of a new Global Advisory Council, with some former US lawmakers as members. According to the announcement, the Council will offer insights and business strategies for the exchange. The Advisory Council includes political heavyweights like former Congressman Tim Ryan (D-OH) and former Senator Patrick Toomey (R-PA). Also, the Council includes former Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney (D-NY), John Anzalone from Impact Research, and Chris Lehane from Haun Ventures. The Council will work closely with Coinbase Asset Management Academic and Regulatory Advisory Council members. Similarly, the Coinbase body comprises prominent personalities such as former SEC Chair Jay Clayton and former CIA General Counsel Courtney Elwood. Related Reading: Lido (LDO) Surges 16% In Single Day, Maintains Dominance In Liquid Staking Market Others are the senior managing director at Compass Lexecon Jon Orszag and Kevin Hassett of the Hoover Institution. Coinbase noted that creating the Advisory Council is a step in the right direction for the company. It would help the exchange to maintain a flawless operation process while rebuilding its strategies in the US and globally. Coinbase is currently in a legal face-off with the SEC. So, engaging a new council is part of its preparatory strategies. Coinbase Prepares To Fight With The SEC Notably, the US SEC has toughened its regulatory stance in the crypto industry and is now closely watching most crypto-related firms. In one of its enforcement actions, the SEC issued a Wells Notice to Coinbase in March, warning the company of a possible lawsuit over alleged breaches of securities. Reacting to the notice, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong noted that the regulator is focusing its accusations on staking and asset listing. He recalled that the SEC had reviewed the exchange‚Äôs operations and approved its license in the past. Armstrong stated that they requested a reasonable explanation from the SEC. According to the CEO, the firm intended to use the reply for rulemaking to maintain the right regulatory requirements for crypto assets. However, the SEC gave no response to the exchange‚Äôs request. Further, Paul Grewal, the Chief Legal Officer of Coinbase, expressed disappointment over the SEC‚Äôs preference for lawsuits to constructive dialoguing. He noted that despite all their efforts to work with the SEC, the regulator gave them no feedback. Grewal stated that Coinbase would defend the rule of law if the SEC initiated a legal battle. -Featured image: Pexels, Chart: TradingView",NEUTRAL,LDO,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | LDO,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/coinbase-engages-legal-and-political-aids-in-battling-sec/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/12621068.jpeg

Although the BRC-20 token is still trading in the red zone, it appears to be attempting a market recovery following this sudden hike in its market value. BRISE: Biggest Gainer In Top 200 Coin Roster According to data by CoinMarketCap, BRISE has soared by 21.44% over the last day, making it the largest gainer among the Top 200 cryptocurrencies in the market, followed closely by the meme season diamond ‚Äì Pepecoin. This price movement has produced much excitement within the Bitgert community as the BRISE token has been in a bearish state for quite some time, recording significant losses. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that BRISE had lost 3.09% and 26.07% of its value in the last seven and 30 days, respectively. Related Reading: PEPE, DOGE, SHIB See Fierce Competition From New FETH Token BRISE opened its weekly market around a price region of $0.0000003534 and exhibited a steady decline over the next few days before finding support around a market price of $0.0000002759 on May 12. Thereafter, BRISE began to show signs of consolidation before finally experiencing a price surge yesterday morning to trade as high as $0.0000003781. Although Bitgert‚Äôs native token has slipped from such price heights, the decline has been insignificant, and BRISE appears to be gathering momentum for another price breakout. Interestingly, shortly after the BRC-20 token‚Äôs surge, Bitgert‚Äôs developer team announced a supply burn of 500 billion BRISE tokens, which had drawn more interest to the asset as token burns are usually associated with price rises. At the time of writing, BRISE is trading at $0.0000003514 with a 0.4% gain in the last hour. The token‚Äôs daily trading volume is up 6.99%, valued at $9.71 million. With a circulation supply of 395.68 trillion tokens, Birget‚Äôs native coin boasts a market cap value of $139.5 million.

According to the price prediction team at Coincodex, the current public sentiment surrounding BRISE is neutral which is further backed by a Fear and Greed Index of 48. That said, the team forecasts the value of BRISE to plummet by 12.31% in the next five days, falling to a price region of 0.0000003139. However, they soon anticipate a dashing reversal, with the BRC-20 token projected to have resumed its bullish course, trading as high as $0.0000004276 in the next 30 days.

12617695,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=532605,1684046452,"Tether Holds $3.4 Billion In Gold Reserves, Nears ATH Market Cap 1 Year Post Terra Collapse","Tether (USDT), the world‚Äôs largest stablecoin by market capitalization, was one of the dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies to have been affected by the collapse of the Terra ecosystem. Now ‚Äì a year later, the stablecoin has reclaimed its stable dollar peg and boasts one of the deepest reserves in the cryptocurrency industry. Related Reading: Tether Smashes Records, $1.48 Billion Profit In Q1- Surplus Over Reserves Hits All-Time High Prominent Crypto Figure Dubs Tether A ‚ÄòPrecious Metals Powerhouse‚Äô Gabor Gurbacs, on Friday, May 12, provided an insight into the significance of precious metals to Tether‚Äôs financial setup. Interestingly, Gurbacs, the founder of PointsVille, dubbed Tether‚Äôs USDT a ‚Äúprecious metals powerhouse‚Äù. According to Gurbacs‚Äô tweet, Tether Holdings Limited, the issuer of the USDT stablecoin, has placed substantial importance on gold, forging a solid reputation in the industry. His tweet also reveals that USDT, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has a staggering sum of roughly $3.4 billion in reserves held in gold. In the same breath, Gurbacs noted that approximately $500 million backs the circulating supply of Tether Gold (XAUT), Tether‚Äôs gold-pegged stablecoin. Furthermore, the amount of gold in Tether reserves far outweighs that of Bitcoin (BTC), which stands at about $1.5 billion. From Gubarcs‚Äô perspective, the diversity of the USDT reserves ‚Äì which consists of gold, cash, corporate bonds, BTC, etc. ‚Äì helps protect the stablecoin against potential market collapses and unexpected negative events. Considering his advisory role within the firm, it may be fair to consider Gubarcs‚Äô analysis of Tether‚Äôs financial strategy as an insider viewpoint. Terra Collapse ‚Äì One Year Later In one of the most catastrophic events in the crypto industry, the Terra ecosystem collapsed in May 2022, with its UST stablecoin losing its dollar peg. The ripple effect saw investors lose faith in most dollar-backed assets, including Tether USD. This caused the panic sale of these dollar-backed assets. As a result, Tether‚Äôs dollar peg broke momentarily, with the token falling as low as 92 cents at times. Furthermore, two months after the Terra collapse, Tether‚Äôs market capitalization had dropped by roughly $16 billion to $65 billion, an indication of massive withdrawals by token holders. While this unfortunate event was an unexpected test of USDT‚Äôs resilience and stablecoins, as an entity, many would agree with the fact that Tether passed the test resoundingly. After all, USDT regained its dollar peg only two months after the crash. Meanwhile, in terms of market capitalization, USDT has made a robust recovery since. In fact, USDT‚Äôs market cap currently stands at $82.9 billion, according to data from CoinGecko. This means that the stablecoin is now more than ever closer to its all-time high market cap of $83 billion.

One market that has felt the brunt of this correction is BRC-20 token which has suffered a major dip in its market cap. According to brc-20.io, which tracks the nascent market for tokens minted on the Bitcoin blockchain, the market cap of all BRC-20 tokens between May 8 and 11 went from $990,000,000 to $379,000,000, a 62% drop. At the time of writing, the market cap of BRC-20 tokens has rebounded and is around $570,000,000, making it a 40% dip within the seven-day trading period. Related Reading: Bakkt Streamlines Apex Crypto Platform By Removing 25 Tokens The BRC-20 market is largely tied to the capitalization of ORDI token, which dominates more than 80% of the trading volumes. At the time of writing, it is currently trading around $15, down from its all-time high price of $28, achieved earlier in the month. The importance of ORDI in this market means that price variations directly and considerably affect the market cap of BRC-20 tokens. A Deep Dive Into BRC-20 Token BRC-20 is an experimental standard for issuing and transferring fungible tokens on the Bitcoin network. The deployment, issuance, and transfer of these tokens is done via a JSON data entry. Hence its relationship with the NFT Ordinals of Bitcoin. The creation of this standard is credited to a developer known as Domo on Twitter. On March 8, the computer scientist announced his progress in this area and acknowledged that it would be difficult for him to take this test further. For this reason, he preferred to share the project with others to experiment with. Since then, the ecosystem has exploded, with more than 14.000 tokens launched, according to brc-20.io. Although the name BRC-20 is a reference to Ethereum‚Äôs ERC-20 standard. However, both standards differ in several of their characteristics, especially due to the differences between the networks in which they work, Bitcoin and Ethereum. First of all, Bitcoin‚Äôs BRC-20 tokens do not have the ability to interact with smart contracts, while ERC-20s do. Other limitations of the BRC-20 tokens compared to those of Ethereum is that they cannot have decimals, be burned or frozen, and have additional functions such as approval or delegation. Related Reading: PayPal Plunging Despite Increasing Crypto Holdings BRC-20 Tokens Not Without Controversy Some Bitcoin maximalists have criticized the growing popularity of BRC-20 tokens due to their effect on the Bitcoin network. There has been growing congestion on the Bitcoin network, and it broke the record for the average number of transactions processed per block with an astonishing 4,373 transactions, marking an all-time high. Nevertheless, proponents of this token standard argue that it expands the Bitcoin blockchain to new possibilities and provides new use cases for the leading cryptocurrency. -Featured Image from iStock, charts from brc-20.io and Tradingview",NEGATIVE,ORDI,BTC | ICO | MARKET | TRADING | ORDI,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/brc-20-tokens-lose-40-market-cap-in-7-days-heres-why/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/12617231.jpeg
