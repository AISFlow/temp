42402555,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdQlgw,1549053908,Coinbase's Director of Data Science and Risk Leaves to 'Build From Scratch',"Soups Ranjan, director of data science and risk at Coinbase, has left the cryptocurrency exchange after three and a half years.  Ranjan announced his departure Thursday in a tweet and a lengthy blog post, in which he wrote:  ""Last week marked the end of my tour of duties at Coinbase where I built many systems and teams from ground up (data, risk, tools, identity). It was an exhilarating three and half years and Coinbase is quite a rocket-ship that I am immensely grateful to have had a front row seat on.""  He added that at Coinbase, he started to enjoy ""building things from scratch"" and suggested that readers ""stay tuned"" to his next move.  Ranjan is on the board of directors of RiskSalon, a monthly roundtable on risk management based in San Francisco Bay Area, which he co-founded with Nate Kugland, data science manager at Airbnb. It's unclear if he has made any decision about his next career move.  It's also unclear whether Coinbase has filled his position, or intends to. Neither Ranjan nor Coinbase responded to request for comments at press time.  Reacting to Ranjan's announcement, Linda Xie, a former Coinbase manager and the co-founder and managing director of Scalar Capital, tweeted: ""End of an era! It was such a pleasure getting to work closely together over the years.""  Risk management in tricky times  According to Ranjan's own account, at Coinbase he supervised the risk team, building security features for users' accounts, tools ""to streamline workflows for legal, compliance, accounting teams"" and managing identity verification and know-your-customer (KYC) integration. He also led the data science team working to automate Coinbase's processes for identity and anti-fraud checks.  In his farewell post, Ranjan noted that in the beginning, Coinbase had had ""a pretty hard payment fraud problem due to the instant and irreversible nature of cryptocurrencies,"" so he and his team developed a system of users' risk scores and machine-learning-based mechanisms detecting if a customer ""is using a stolen payment instrument to purchase cryptocurrencies.""  Another accomplishment he listed was the introduction of step-up authentication at Coinbase, when users need to produce additional proof they are who they say they are to sign in when there is a risk of account takeover.  He also recalled problems Coinbase ran into during bitcoin's unprecedented rally in December 2017:  ""During the crypto bull run of 2017, we had huge backlogs in Identity document verification. We had to turn away several customers. We quickly overhauled our verification infrastructure and went from a fully manual process to one where an automated system does a first pass at annotating and validating IDs followed by a fallback to the manual process.""  Ranjan thanked his supervisors and colleagues and Coinbase, noting that it became a kind of ""crypto university,"" whose alumni gain enough knowledge to start something new and share their expertise with the community.

42402564,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdQlmq,1549044135,"QuadrigaCX Owes Customers $190 Million, Court Filing Shows","Troubled Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX owes its customers $190 million and cannot access most of the funds, according to a court filing obtained by CoinDesk.  In a sworn affidavit filed Jan. 31 with the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, Jennifer Robertson, identified as the widow of QuadrigaCX founder Gerald Cotten, said the exchange owes its customers roughly $250 million CAD ($190 million) in both cryptocurrency and fiat. The company previously announced it had filed for creditor protection on its website, but the filing itself provides greater details about its predicament.  As of Jan. 31, 2019, there were roughly 115,000 users with balances signed up on the exchange, with $70 million CAD in fiat and $180 million CAD in crypto owed overall, according to the filing.  The exchange holds roughly 26,500 bitcoin ($92.3 million USD), 11,000 bitcoin cash ($1.3 million), 11,000 bitcoin cash SV ($707,000), 35,000 bitcoin gold ($352,000), nearly 200,000 litecoin ($6.5 million) and about 430,000 ether ($46 million), totaling $147 million, according to the affidavit.  It was not clear what portion of the exchange’s crypto holding were kept in cold storage, versus its hot wallet. In the affidavit, Robertson explained that “only a minimal amount of coins” were stored in the hot wallet, but specifics were not provided.  Robertson added that:  ""The normal procedure was that [QuadrigaCX founder and CEO Gerald Cotten] would move the majority of the coins to cold storage as a way to protect the coins from hacking or other virtual theft.""  She added that Cotten held “sole responsibility for handling the funds and coins,” and the remaining team members have had no luck accessing the exchange’s cold wallets since.  There is a possibility that some of Quadriga’s funds are being stored on other exchanges, though this has not been confirmed, she said.  Cotten reportedly died of Crohn’s disease in Jaipur, India in early December 2018. The exchange announced his death earlier this month. A death certificate was included in the list of exhibits.  The founder seemingly had sole control or knowledge of Quadriga’s cold storage solution. Robertson wrote that after his death, “Quadriga’s inventory of cryptocurrency has become unavailable and some of it may be lost.”  She later added that she has no business records whatsoever for QuadrigaCX or its affiliated companies. While she does have Cotten's laptop, the device is encrypted and she does not have its password or recovery key. While a consultant has been retained to try and recover the laptop's contents, he has had limited success to date.  Fiat issues  The exchange’s access to its fiat holdings have also been “severely compromised” by banking issues, the filing says. In particular, a now-resolved legal fight with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) has resulted in ongoing issues.  In particular, a payment processor working with Quadriga, Billerfy, has reported problems with finding a banking partner, preventing the processor from releasing any funds back to the exchange, and therefore, to its customers.  In addition to the roughly $30 million CAD currently being held by Billerfy, three other third-party processors are holding around $565,000 CAD combined.  A fifth payment processor called WB21 is holding another $9 million CAD and $2.4 million USD (roughly $9.2 million USD total) on Quadriga’s behalf.  However, WB21 “is refusing to release the funds or respond to communications from Quadriga,” the affidavit claimed.  In an email, WB21 PR manager Ralf Mueller wrote, ""WB21 did not confirm the balances mentioned in the affidavit to be correct. In lieu of Quadriga's current legal situation, our compliance team had to restrict the account until the investigation is completed.""  ""We can`t disclose client balances publicly due to our confidentiality duties,"" Mueller added in a subsequent email.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is suing WB21 US Inc and WB21 NA Inc, as well as affiliated individuals on unrelated fraud charges.  Under an “additional issues” section, Robertson noted that users have also continued to deposit funds after Cotten’s death, which the exchange accepted. Some of these came from automatic deposits, though CoinDesk has confirmed that manual deposits were also accepted from at least one user.  Request for assistance  The affidavit concludes with a request that the court enter a stay of proceedings to preempt any lawsuits that might be filed.  The exchange “urgently needs a stay of proceedings which will allow Quadriga and its contractors additional time to find whatever stores of cryptocurrency may be available and also to negotiate the bank drafts available to Quadriga,” Robertson wrote.  “Many, if not all” of the exchange’s customers might suffer further damages without a stay, she said.  Users have been complaining about withdrawal issues and a lack of communication from QuadrigaCX's team for months, with concerns exacerbated earlier this week when the website went down entirely for maintenance.  Robertson noted that the exchange's new directors voted to ""temporarily pause"" the platform on Jan. 26. Though she did not explicitly say the website went down as a result, the portal only became inaccessible sometime in the morning on Jan. 28.  To help pay users back, the exchange is considering selling off its operating platform. “Multiple parties” have already approached the exchange to inquire about acquiring the operating platform, though none are named in the filing.  Robertson added that she believes the “trading platform may have significant value,” but this value may be reduced if the exchange is sued.  Quadriga is hoping the court will schedule a hearing on Feb. 5 to confirm the stay of proceedings, as well as appoint Ernst & Young to act as an independent third party to oversee its operations for the immediate future.

42402568,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdQlqm,1549044010,Ethereum Developers Delay Mining Algorithm Change for Code Audit,"Developers contributing to the ethereum protocol are electing to hold off on a decision to submit code that would stifle the advantage of high-powered ASIC miners competing for the network's rewards.  During a public call Friday, which included Hudson Jameson, Lane Rettig, Afri Schodedon, Martin Holst Swende, Danno Ferrin and Greg Colvin, among other notable developers, a tentative decision was reached to postpone the so-called ProgPow upgrade in favor of conducting continued audits.  These third-party audits will look to verify that implementing the algorithm will reduce ASIC efficiency so as to make them less competitive against GPUs, a cheaper and more consumer-friendly mining technology.  A number of the call's participants expressed discomfort with providing a firm decision on whether to execute the algorithm, leading to the delay.  The decision stems from a push to avoid a consolidation in the number of participants verifying transactions on ethereum. If implemented, the algorithm would theoretically allow for a greater number of miners to participate in the network.  Jameson, a communications officer with the Ethereum Foundation, said a third-party audit will likely answer many questions the community still has about the update.  ""If we can get to a point where we say, 'This will work and here's why it will work,' that would help a lot,"" Jameson said of the audit, later adding:  ""If we find no [issues] ... that should give us enough confidence that the decision should be made for us.""  Software engineer Ferrin concurred, saying the audits will provide more data about how the update might impact ethereum than is available at present. There is no clear timeline yet on when the audits might conclude, with Jameson saying he expects March or early April to be realistic targets.  Colvin called for greater clarity around when a decision may definitively be made.  ""We are all so very tired of this,"" he said, adding:  ""I would happily decide today, but I'm not the expert. I'm happy to wait for the audit but I'm not happy to make this decision in May or something. An awful lot of people would like to know so they can get on with their business. 'Am I going to spend $1,000 to buy a rack of CPUs or not?'""  Separately, the developers agreed to gather more input from the ethereum community at large. ""We still haven't explored all the possibilities about exploring community feedback,"" Jameson said.  The group will also look into miner signaling specifically, though Rettig noted that the vote ""will likely be asymmetrical,"" explaining that while a ""strong vote"" in favor of executing ProgPoW would obviously be a clear sign of support, a lack of a vote against might not necessarily mean anything.

42402570,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdQlsk,1549036800,Casa's Lightning-Enabled Bitcoin Node Just Got a Browser Extension,"Cryptocurrency custody startup Casa has just launched a browser extension for its lightning network-enabled bitcoin node.  Now, users will be able to interact with their Casa Nodes – hardware devices that connect to and help validate the bitcoin blockchain – directly on any cryptocurrency website that boasts lightning network functionality.  Lightning  is a layer-two payments protocol running atop the bitcoin network to facilitate transactions at higher speeds and larger volumes. Some web-based applications such as Satoshi’s Place – a blockchain-based art sharing platform – leverage the lightning network as a more efficient means for users to make bitcoin payments.  “The main thing right now if you’re using a Casa Node and your going … to any of these other [crypto] sites, you're basically having to open a second browser tab to open the main Casa dashboard and enter in all the [payment] information somewhat manually,” Casa founder Jeremy Welch told CoinDesk.  Starting today, Welch said that Casa will support the extension in two web browsers – Google Chrome and Firefox – by which users can control their Casa Node directly and enter in payment information more easily on websites that are lightning-network enabled.  Having been built in “less than a month,” according to Welch, this product is just one of many anticipated in the first quarter of this year.  “We’ve been pushing out a lot of code and one of the things that drives us is that fact that when we push products out and when we really put a lot of time into stuff, we know that people are going to get really engaged,” Welch explained. “We’ve got a lot more coming out this year. It’s just the beginning for 2019.”  Outpacing expectations  Indeed, describing the current phase of blockchain development more broadly as similar to the “early days of the internet,” Welch anticipates “there’s going to be a lot more lightning applications that are out there on the web.”  And it’s not just Casa that’s working these types of tools to increase usability of the bitcoin lightning network.  The new browser extension, Welch noted, couldn’t have been built without the help of Will O’Beirn – the founder of blockchain-based crowdfunding platform Grant.io and developer of a separate, standalone lightning browser extension called Joule.  “[Joule] got quite a bit of attention I would say at the end of the year, early January and we were getting a bunch of requests [for browser extension] from customers,” said Welch. “We also had previously planned for it before and so we put these plans together and talked to Will.”  As part of this push for increased collaboration, Casa announced yesterday it would be open-sourcing key features of the Casa Node.  That move primarily revolved around improving product security, but also aims to extend creative license for people to “reuse, extend, and improve [product] code,” as stated in the firm's anouncement.  Welch said:  “I would say everything [Casa] has built has been difficult. We're pioneering new ground ... [but] it’s a privilege to build for a community that really appreciates new products and that’s one of the things that’s driving us this year.”  The Casa Node product in particular has seen a positive response from users since its release last year in October.  While refraining from specifying exactly how many Casa Node products have been sold, Welch did reveal to CoinDesk that the number of orders Casa has received since then has “outpaced initial expectations.”  “We had a small batch [of Casa Nodes] that went out end of October, a batch in November, and a batch in December. Those got much bigger, much quicker. We sold 100 in the first hour and we sold another 200 by the end of the first day,” he said.

42413910,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAmdBZ,1549035032,Wall Street Crypto Products May Have to Wait as US Regulators Confront Backlog,"The U.S. government may be open again, but don't hold your breath for regulatory approvals of crypto investment products.  The shutdown, which began on Dec. 22, 2018 and ended on Jan. 25, forced federal agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), to shutter their doors. This in turn delayed product launches and caused some companies to pull proposals.  Now that they're back to work, though, the SEC, CFTC and other regulators have five weeks of work to catch up on. And the industry's advocates in Washington, D.C. are under no illusions that a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) or similar applications will get expedited treatment.  Kristin Smith of the Blockchain Association likened the reopening to starting a car after not driving it for an entire winter, explaining that it would take time for the various regulators and agencies to begin operating at full strength again:  ""Everything still works but you need to give it time to warm up. It’s been frustrating, but I think at worst you’ve seen companies delay rather than cancel plans and now folks are eager to pick up where they left off.""  SEC chairman Jay Clayton announced in a public statement that the regulator was ""returning to normal operations."" During the shutdown, the agency monitored markets but only took action ""to prevent imminent threats to property,"" he noted.  That being said, while the agency's 4,500 employees are back on duty, he noted that the leaders of the SEC's various divisions needed to determine how best to transition back to business as usual. Some of these divisions would, therefore, be making their own separate announcements about how they might do so.  Lasting consequences  The shutdown – which was the longest in U.S. history – will likely have ""some repercussions for the space"" as well, said Steve Ehrlich, chief operating officer of the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance.  The foremost issue, he said, is the fact that the reopening may be short-lived. The truce between Congress and U.S. President Donald Trump is temporary, and if the two branches of government cannot agree to a permanent budget and a compromise on the proposed border wall by February 15, the government will shut down again.  ""I can’t imagine any company trusting that the government will not be shut down again following the 21-day reprieve,"" Ehrlich told CoinDesk via email. ""Until there is more certainty that the government will not get shut down again in 21 days, federal regulators will focus their activities on serving the broadest segment of the population and addressing their highest priorities, which may not include crypto.""  Indeed, the Senate and House conference committees only began meeting Wednesday to discuss how to avoid shutting down the government again.  More broadly, companies looking to conduct business or base themselves in the U.S. might have second thoughts, Ehrlich said, adding:  ""Without the comfort of knowing that the political climate will be calmer for the indefinite future, there will be companies that seek to avoid domiciling themselves in the U.S. or will de-risk themselves by avoiding serving U.S. customers ... Those companies that are committed to the U.S. will also face challenges.""  Templum Markets  CEO Vince Molinari told CoinDesk that the SEC ""made an incredible effort to keep up with their immense workload,"" but given how few staffers were on duty during the shutdown (fewer than 300), a 21-day reprieve would not ""materially affect"" the agency's backlog.  ""It would be impossible for any agency to catch up immediately after so many weeks sidelined, despite their best efforts,"" he said.  Indeed, while NYSE Arca and Bitwise Asset Management have filed a rule change proposal for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), the SEC has not yet published the document for review in the Federal Register. This indicates the regulator is not currently examining the document and there is no timeline for when a decision approving or rejecting the proposal may come.  Too late for some  The shutdown has already resulted in several planned product launches or hoped-for approvals being delayed.  ""Conversations that had been ongoing between startups and relevant regulators such as the SEC (including its newly created FinHUB) about business models and plans have likely lost critical momentum and will take time to recover,"" Ehrlich added.  Indeed, the VanEck/SolidX bitcoin ETF proposal was withdrawn by Cboe earlier this month. VanEck CEO Jan van Eck cited the government shutdown as the reason for this decision, explaining that while the companies behind the proposal had been working with the SEC to answer questions about the space, those conversations had been put on pause when the government shut down.  The ETF was re-filed on Thursday, but like NYSE Arca's, it has not yet been published in the Federal Register.  Bitcoin futures exchange Bakkt, developed by the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, is perhaps the other most-anticipated product launch, but it too is dependent on regulatory approval. The company is waiting on the CFTC to green-light its proposal, but first, the commissioners must release it for public comment. After the 30-day public comment period concludes, the commissioners must then vote to approve Bakkt's offerings.  As such, there is currently no timeline for when Bakkt may go live. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment when reached.  Similarly, trading platform ErisX is waiting on the CFTC to grant its derivatives clearing organization application. Conversations between the firm and the regulator halted, though CEO Thomas Chippas told CoinDesk during the shutdown that he looked forward to ""re-engaging with [CFTC] staff"" once the government reopened. ErisX declined to comment on what the reopening would mean for this effort.  In another example of the lingering aftereffects of the shutdown, Ehrlich said he expected that anticipated guidance on token sales from the SEC would be delayed, adding:  ""Plus their restarts could be delayed by the mountains of paperwork that officials will need to address.""

42402553,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdQldz,1549031435,New Malware Targets Apple Mac Computers to Steal and Mine Cryptos,"A recently discovered form of malware steals browser cookies and other information on victims' Apple Mac computers to steal cryptocurrencies.  Researchers at cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks published a report on Thursday, saying that the malware, dubbed “CookieMiner,” intercepts browser cookies related to cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet service providers’ websites visited by the victims.  The malicious code targets exchanges and services including Binance, Coinbase, Poloniex, Bittrex, Bitstamp and MyEtherWallet, as well as any website having ""blockchain"" in its domain name, the researchers found.  The malware also tries to steal credit card information from major issuers, such as Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover, as well as saved usernames and passwords in Chrome, iPhone text messages that are backed up to iTunes and crypto wallet keys.  If CookieMiner succeeds at stealing those details, hackers can gain full access to victims’ crypto exchange and wallet accounts to steal funds.  The researchers explained:  “CookieMiner tries to navigate past the authentication process by stealing a combination of the login credentials, text messages, and web cookies.”  MyEtherWallet founder and CEO Kosala Hemachandra told CoinDesk via email: ""[MyEtherWallet] is not a cryptocurrency exchange but an interface to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. We do not use cookies so this malware ... will not affect our users as long as they do not save their passwords with Chrome.""  CookieMiner has another string to its bow too – it changes a victim's system configuration to maliciously load crypto mining software. The coinminer is similar to a variant that mines monero, but instead targets a lesser-known cryptocurrency called Koto, the researchers said.  The researchers suggested that cryptocurrency users should keep ""an eye on their security settings and digital assets to prevent compromise and leakage."" They also noted that the malware checks if an application firewall program called Little Snitch is running on a victim’s computer. ""If so, it will stop and exit,"" they said  Monero is by far the most popular cryptocurrency among hackers, though. Last month, a study by college researchers showed that hackers have mined nearly 5 percent of the total monero in circulation.  Deployments of crypto-mining malware are rapidly growing in number. A study from McAfee, published in December, showed that there were nearly 4 million new mining malware threats in the third quarter of 2018 alone, compared to less than 500,000 in 2017 and 2016.

42402561,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdQlks,1549027852,Smart Contract Auditor Lets Go 80% of Staff in Crypto Winter Cutbacks,"Hosho was founded under the premise it could safely sell smart contract shovels in a tokenized gold rush – in fact, the company's name itself means ""security"" in Japanese,  ""We thought we were going to go to the moon and audit lots of ICOs,"" Hartej Sawhney, co-founder and president of the company told CoinDesk in a phone call.  Founded in July 2017 and headquartered in Las Vegas, Hosho rode the wave of token sales, expanding quickly and building its brand with a high-profile conference. But by that point, crypto winter had already begun to hit, with prices across major cryptocurrencies dropping, in some cases, 90 percent from their 2017 values.  So, despite the fact that the company now claims to have audited more smart contracts than anyone else in the world during its 17-month run, business slowed abruptly and the firm went from 37 employees to seven in a sweep of late-2018 layoffs.  ""It was painful personally. I've never had to let go of that many people,"" Sawhney said.  The leadership believed with a very small team of their leading technical employees and a new service offering in penetration testing, they could keep the business going until the industry came back.  The death of the robust ICO market with its plethora of new smart contracts was the main cause of Hosho's contraction, according to Sawhney. It had an easy business as long as those kept going, but then the music stopped and business became much, much harder.  Said Sawhney:  ""We realized that the most important thing to us was to stay alive.""  Echoing some of the themes BlockEx spoke to when acknowledging its staff drawdowns, Sawhney noted that some of the decisions it's made, while responsible, have now made surviving crypto winter more difficult.  For example, believing it could build the business on revenue, Hosho did not take venture funding. Arguing that good smart contract auditing at this stage still requires a sophisticated human element, it also didn't do an ICO.  ""There's no reason to do ICOs if you're auditing smart contracts,"" Sawhney said.  Winds blow  As Sawhney tells it, things started taking a turn for the worse in the market around June or July, when ""all of a sudden, we were seeing a lot less smart contracts to audit.""  Looking back, the signs that the industry had over-inflated were there. ""The level of immaturity in this space in the first half of 2018 was very high,"" he said.  Sawhney described auditing smart contracts that hadn't even met the very basics of a project's stated intention, such as advertising one token supply on a project's website but listing another in its smart contract.  He ascribed this to negligence rather than maliciousness. Some teams he saw had clearly cut and pasted from another team's smart contract without changing very much at all.  But other companies were prepared to take an unethical course, offering Hosho a large cut of their token emission if they would give their smart contracts a clean bill of health. As a U.S.-based company overseen by U.S. regulators, however, Hosho declined the business.  ""We were told very scammy things,"" he said.  One other sign that a freeze had taken hold: it wasn't able to fill a conference featuring Andreas Antonopoulos.  Its conference, HoshoCon, only sold about 350 tickets for an event on blockchain security that ran from October 9 to 11 last year. In the end, it felt empty because the company ran it in one of the big Las Vegas convention spaces.  ""HoshoCon was a success in my eyes,"" Sawhney told us, saying losses there weren't instrumental in the staffing cuts that came the next month. He added:  ""The money that we lost isn't money that we lost if we do it again, and we're going to do it again.""  Shrink staff, expand services  Looking back, Sawhney sees a lot of things that they could have done differently during the boom.  ""I would hire slower,"" he said. ""We got a little bit excited about going to the moon in this industry.""  He also would have hired broader. He let his staff convince him that their whole team needed to be based in the U.S., which makes for a very expensive team. Today, he's very much focused on expanding the technical team in Ukraine.  Lastly, he doesn't regret taking part of Hosho's payments in crypto, but he would have exited more of it into fiat. Early on, they paid all their bills in their fiat income and held the crypto. He said:  ""If ethereum is at $1,000 you feel like you're a hedge fund. If ethereum is $200, you feel you should liquidate some of your ethereum to pay the bills.""  Still, Hosho sees a path to recovery. Its experience has allowed it to run leaner with more automated tools for its smart contract and protocol audits. ""We are much faster than we were ever before,"" he said.  But the company is not staying solely in that lane. Much of Hosho's team has white-hat security services experiences and it's selling those as well, to crypto firms or anyone who needs them.  ""Today we have cryptocurrency exchanges losing two to $2.5 million per day,"" he said, a point that Ledger's CEO has emphasized on this site.  ""A lot of these things can be avoided with regular penetration testing."" So, the company is spending a lot of time educating founders in crypto about best practices from other industries.  ""We are really focused on expanding our presence into Asia,"" he said, a place where he says there is much less competition for security talent and more blockchain growth.  The point is to keep the company afloat and its reputation strong until the overall industry comes back. He said:  ""Basically it's a game to stay alive.""

The U.K.-based startup announced Thursday that consumers of the Berlin-headquartered firm's content can pay using SatoshiPay's wallet, which is built based on Stellar blockchain technology. Axel Springer owns titles including Business Insider, Die Welt and Rolling Stone (German edition).  SatoshiPay said that, as of Jan. 31, its wallet will be integrated into Axel Springer's online products and will work without any intermediaries, so payments will be directly credited to the publisher’s account from its content consumers.  Axel Springer’s senior vice president for new business, Dr Valentin Schöndienst, said:  “Blockchain payments can significantly reduce transaction costs and thus enable new monetisation systems for content.""  SatoshiPay said it processes payments using the Stellar blockchain in various forms of value, including euro and dollar transfers, “in a matter of seconds.”  Founded in 2014, SatoshiPay had been based on bitcoin technology until July 2017. Then, in November of the same year, the startup collaborated with Stellar Development Foundation to offer micropayments that were “much faster and less costly.” In December 2017, it fully integrated with the Stellar network.  In July of last year, SatoshiPay said it planned to list on AIM, a sub-market of the London Stock Exchange, when London-based crypto investor Daniel Masters invested €566,000 (or $647,829) in its pre-IPO funding.  Axel Springer SE generated total revenues of over €3.5 billion (around $4 billion) in 2017, according to the announcement. Digital media activities contribute more than 60 percent of its revenues.

42402565,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdQloo,1549022412,Developers Behind Ethereum App Aragon Weigh Launching a Second Network on Polkadot,"Developers behind ethereum decentralized application (dapp) Aragon are considering building a second network on the blockchain interoperability protocol known as Polkadot.  While Swiss company Aragon One AG stressed that it still intends to support launch of the Aragon Network on the ethereum blockchain this year, cofounder of the project Jorge Izquierdo revealed this week that they may additionally launch aragonOS, a framework to build smart contracts, on Polkadot.  ""The idea is to make most aragonOS transactions almost free and very optimized, so users can seamlessly run [decentralized autonomous organizations] in a cheaper and faster way,"" said Aragon cofounder Luis Cuende in interview with CoinDesk.  Cuende emphasized that the company is still ""very bullish on ethereum and its ecosystem,"" adding that ""in terms of the Aragon Network, the plans are still to deploy it to ethereum during 2019.""  The idea of launching aragonOS on Polkadot is ""still very early research,"" Cuende said.  Indeed, going so far as to add a “speculation disclaimer” to the presentation, Izquierdo highlighted in his slides that “the Aragon Chain is on an early research phase.” Aragon's exploration of a possible Polkadot network launch will run parallel to its continued research on the coming upgrade to ethereum known as Serenity, he said.  Those caveats aside, Aragon's openness to alternatives to ethereum is seen in some corners as a wake-up call for the world's second-largest blockchain, which is working to overcome scaling limitations.  Ethereum developer Lane Rettig told CoinDesk that he hoped the nascent research project would ""light a fire"" in the ethereum community to speed up scaling efforts, saying:  ""Aragon has not said they're migrating off ethereum, just that they're exploring options ... But I do consider it an early warning sign, from one of the most important app ecosystems on ethereum, and I think we should heed the warning.""  'Early warning sign'  Stepping back, Polkadot is designed to coordinate “consensus and transaction delivery” between different blockchains, as stated on the official website.  Developed by ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, the protocol is presently live on a test network. Expected to launch officially near the end of this year, the project also announced Friday that it was looking to raise $60 million through a token sale, following an earlier initial coin offering which raised $145 million.  The fast development of the Polkadot network since its inception back in 2016 is seen by some ethereum developers as “an early warning sign … that ethereum risks losing its edge,"" Rettig said on Twitter,  This sentiment is also echoed in an earlier “Ask Me Anything” Reddit forum about ethereum’s scaling roadmap. The highest ranking question to the research and development team about Serenity – also called ethereum 2.0 – was this:  “The Polkadot team has stated their chain might launch by the end of the year. Why should people/devs bother to go to the Beacon or to wait for its full sharding when they can just go to the Parity chain or somewhere else?”  Other developers such as Afri Schoedon – release manager for ethereum client Parity – are less convinced there's a need for concern or worry from the ethereum community at present.  ""In the end, we will see how application developers embrace the Polkadot network [once launched],"" said Schoedon in interview with CoinDesk. ""Currently, ethereum has by far the most dapp engineers, but that can change any time with new tooling being available in future.""  'Complementary' blockchains  On the other hand, the team behind Polkadot – overseen by Parity Technologies and the Web3 Foundation – is adamant that their technology is not meant to act as a competitor to ethereum.  Jack Platts, director of communications at the Web3 Foundation, told CoinDesk that the protocol should be seen as ""complementary"" to ethereum. He added:  ""We at the Web3 Foundation think about these blockchains as being interoperable and of there being many more blockchains in the future than there are in the past.""  Adding that the organization is ""betting on this multi-chain universe,"" Platt highlighted that one of the Web3 Foundation's present initiatives was funding ""the development of ethereum-compatible technologies.""  To this end, the foundation announced Tuesday the first recipient of its grants program – ChainSafe Systems – which, along with building a fully-fleshed out ethereum 2.0 client, is now expected to develop a portion of the Polkadot environment in the programming language Golang.  ""What we generally do for our clients is implement sidechains and then bridge those sidechains to the ethereum mainnet. What Polkadot does is build a future in which we're able to do that in a much more optimized way where we're able to utilize technology that's been built to do the things that we do every day,"" ChainSafe Systems CEO Aidan Hyman told CoinDesk.  He added:  ""I'm personally – beyond this grant – extremely excited to see what Polkadot brings to the future of blockchain.""  The amount of the grant to ChainSafe Systems was not publicly disclosed.  Correction: A previous version of this article described Aragon as a company. The article has been updated to differentiate between Aragon One AG – the company – and Aragon – the decentralized application.

42393838,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpPX1d,1549018799,Bitcoin Price Hits Record Sixth Consecutive Month of Losses,"View  Bitcoin registered losses for a record sixth straight month in January, reinforcing the bearish view put forward by the moving average studies on the monthly chart. As a result, a re-test of December lows near $3,100 could be on the cards.  The odds of a sustained rise to $4,000 would improve if the 200-week moving average at $3,298 serves as strong support and ends up pushing prices above $3,658 (high of last Saturday’s gravestone doji candle).  Bitcoin's price fell for a record sixth consecutive month in January, after an early bounce to $4,000 failed to entice mass buying.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value closed yesterday at $3,413 on Bitstamp – down 7.59 percent from the monthly opening price of $3,693. Prices dropped 9, 6, 4.4, 37 and 7 percent, respectively, in the previous five months.  The second longest run of monthly losses dates back to 2011 when prices dropped 81 percent during the five months from July to November.  BTC has fared a little better in the last six months, with a 63 percent loss over the period. That number, however, could rise in the coming months, as the primary trend is still bearish, as discussed yesterday.  Further, the price action witnessed over the last four weeks indicates that the sell-on-rise mentality is still intact.  The cryptocurrency jumped above $4,000 on Jan. 6, after establishing a bullish higher-low near $3,550 at the end of December. The bullish breakout, however, failed to entice the buyers. In fact, bullish bets tanked on Jan. 10, driving prices back to $3,500  That said, BTC may end the six-month downward trend in February if the 200-week moving average (MA) support, currently at $3,298, fuels a strong move above crucial resistance near $3,650. As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,400.  Monthly chart  On the monthly chart, the 5- and 10-candle MAs are trending south, indicating a bearish setup. These averages are currently located at $4,154 and $5,599, respectively, and could cap rallies, if any, in the near-term.  Validating the bearish averages is the 14-month relative strength index (RSI), which has hit record lows below the low of 44.50 seen in January 2015.  The bearish setup would be invalidated only above $4,210 – the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the record low-record high. That level has capped the upside in the last two months.  Weekly and daily chart  As seen above, the 200-week moving average (MA) served as strong support seven weeks ago. Another defense of the long-term MA will likely weaken bearish pressures and could yield a break above $3,658 (the high of last Saturday's gravestone doji candle).  A convincing move above that level would invalidate short-term bearish setup and open the doors for a sustained move to $4,000.

42402571,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdQlrl,1549015242,UK Firm Gets Regulatory Green Light to Offer Crypto Derivatives,"B2C2, an electronic OTC trading firm and crypto liquidity provider, has just got the green light to offer crypto derivatives in the U.K.  The London-based firm announced Thursday that its subsidiary B2C2 OTC Ltd. is now authorized and regulated by country's financial watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), to arrange and deal in crypto contracts for difference (CFDs).  Crypto CFDs allow traders to predict the future price change of specific cryptocurrencies, and in turn, provide an opportunity to make profit in both rising and falling markets by going long or short.  B2C2 OTC’s CFD product offers exposure to bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC) and XRP, according to the announcement.  Max Boonen, B2C2 founder and CEO, said that, with the firm’s offering, “eligible counterparties and professional clients can now gain derivative exposure to the cryptocurrency markets” and avoid the “risks associated with crypto custody.”  The FCA’s authorization of a crypto derivatives product is a notable one, as in the past it has issued warnings over CFDs. In November 2017, the authority said: “Cryptocurrency CFDs are an extremely high-risk, speculative investment. You should be aware of the risks involved and fully consider whether investing in cryptocurrency CFDs is appropriate for you.”  Last April, though, the FCA said that it was likely to authorize crypto CFDs providers given that these products may be financial instruments under current directives. It said at the time: “Firms conducting regulated activities in cryptocurrency derivatives must, therefore, comply with all applicable rules in the FCA’s Handbook and any relevant provisions in directly applicable European Union regulations.”  The regulator has been moving to tighten oversight of the crypto space. Just last week, the FCA set out proposed guidance for how crypto assets should be regulated in the country. Yet, while aiming to protect against the perceived risks of the tech, it has taken a more positive stance on blockchain innovation, including accepting crypto startups into its regulatory sandbox.

Announced today, 28 tons of mandarin oranges, or 3,000 cartons containing approximately 108,000 fruits, were delivered ahead of Chinese New Year celebration on Feb. 5 (mandarin oranges are a symbol of prosperity, IBM explained). The main shipping document, the bill of lading, was recorded on a blockchain.  This document serves as a proof of ownership of goods, as a receipt of goods and a contract of the shipment, and normally it's mailed to all parties involved in the shipment, including banks providing trade financing. For the pilot, IBM created an electronic bill of lading, or e-BL, which helped reduce and speed up administrative processes ""to just one second"" as the document flow is automated, the company claims — while the standard paper-based procedure takes five to seven days.  “By using the e-BL, we have seen how the entire shipment process can be simplified and made more transparent with considerable cost savings,"" Tay Khiam Back, the chairman and CEO of fruit importer Hupco, said in a press release.  Cutting costs  Along with saving time with the document processing, the trial showed that a blockchain-based electronic system can cut operating costs like electricity used for refrigerated cargo containers while they wait for collection at the port, storage costs and other expenses, IBM said. It also made for a better handling of information, providing a traceable and tamper-proof storage of records for the maritime shipment industry, where document fraud accounts for 40% of all fraud.  “To-date, we have received very positive feedback from the industry and authorities, and we are enthused by the possibilities of how our blockchain developments can transform and inject a much-needed boost in efficiency and innovation into the industry,” Lisa Teo, Executive Director of Pacific International Lines, said in the press release.  Earlier this month, IBM announced another blockchain-powered supply chain pilot, which would track the trip of cobalt mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo, going through a Chinese refinery and a Korean battery factory to a Ford Motors plant in the U.S.  Most significantly, IBM's Food Trust blockchain went live last year, with Walmart participating.

The company noted in a blog post late Thursday that it had on-boarded ""a select set of eligible clients"" already, while it worked on building Fidelity Digital Asset Services (FDAS). Fidelity first announced it would be launching a digital asset service last October.  At present, the company is working with auditors to polish its existing policies and procedures, as well as ""to set new benchmarks for this aspect of cryptographic and blockchain-based finance.""  Without giving a firm timeframe for a formal launch, the post noted that:  ""Our initial clients are an important part of our final testing and process refinement periods, which will eventually enable us to provide these services to a broader set of eligible institutions.""  While the update did not explicitly confirm a Bloomberg report that FDAS was planning to launch publicly in March, it is consistent with the company's earlier statements that the platform would go live in the first quarter of this year.  The storage component is already custodying assets on behalf of its initial customers.  Further supporting optimism about a near-term launch, FDAS put out a call for prospective clients in its post, writing that ""over the next several months, we will thoughtfully engage with and stage prospective clients based on their needs, jurisdiction and other factors.""  The company's trading and custody solutions are at roughly the same stage of development and are expected to launch around the same time. At launch, FDAS will support bitcoin and ethereum with ""institutional-grade custody,"" alongside other services.
