42426704,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJw9Ph,1458244085,Family Offices See Legitimacy in Securitized Bitcoin Investments,"Investors with over $1tn in assets under management gathered at an event last night to judge if bitcoin is ready to be recognized as a mainstream asset class.  Onstage, the event looked like countless other bitcoin demo days, but it was what transpired between the panelists and the audience of 110 estimated family offices investors, hedge fund investors and private equity firms that gave it a decidedly different twist.  Myles Edwards, who represents ultra-high net-worth individuals and co-founded the New York Family Office Private Funds Roundtable, said his firm organized the event to learn more about digital currency as it is interested in a wide range of securitized investments.  Edwards told CoinDesk:  ""What really intrigues us about tonight is that there is a clear synergy, a clear nexus between what’s happening in the digital world, and what’s happening in financial services. And that is going to be the catalyst to bring us to the next generation.""  Edwards, who is also general counsel at financial advisory firm Shufro, Rose & Co, said he couldn’t mention specific hedge funds which had begun to securitize the assets. But he added that the high-net-worth members of the Roundtable saw the existence of such investment packages as a stamp of approval.  ""There’s legitimate hedge and private equity funds that are ready to invest,"" he said. ""They’ve done their due diligence and that's got people’s attention.""  In 2014, bitcoin made headlines as the worst asset class of the year, beating out the Russian ruble, according to a widely reported Quartz article. But in 2015, the cryptocurrency was barely a blip on the best and worst investment lists of the year, leading to an even steadier 2016.  So far, this year bitcoin's price has fluctuated between about $458 and $358, but it has mostly hovered around its current price of $418.  Future possibilities  Hosted by blockchain consultancy firm Agentic Group at the newly opened Citco Gateway Offices on Park Avenue, three companies representing a wide range of bitcoin and blockchain services took questions from audience members.  Main concerns related to financial regulations for bitcoin investments and HIPAA compliance concerns for medical-related applications of the blockchain.  In attendance were industry-specific consultants specializing in blockcahin and cryptocurrency asset management as well as more traditional outfits, such as FINRA/SEC licensed broker dealer Young America Capital and Breckenridge Insurance Group.  Rik Willard, managing director and founder of Agentic Group, said that while some family offices remain hesitant to invest in bitcoin and blockchain-related products hedge funds are increasingly looking to the asset class on a time horizon of between two years and five years.  ""You don’t hear a lot about family offices in blockchain, you don't hear of them in bitcoin, for a reason. VCs have their own way of looking at this market,"" said Willard. ""But there’s trillions of other dollars out there looking to the future. To leave that untapped, unaddressed seemed to me pretty wasteful.""

42426699,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJw9Fh,1458237930,Bitcoin Trading Platform BitQuick Offline After Server Attack,"Bitcoin trading platform BitQuick was the target of a cyberattack this week that temporarily resulted in unauthorized access to its server.  The startup said on Tuesday that the platform had been taken offline due to a security incident. In a statement published today, BitQuick said that the attack, which took place on Monday, did not result in the loss of customer funds or sensitive information.  The company explained:  ""The breach was immediately noticed, and the server was shutdown to prevent any further damage. We are still performing a formal investigation to determine the attack vector, and specifically what information was obtained from the server. Due to additional security mechanisms in place, no funds were taken, and all IDs (driver’s licenses, passports, etc) and emails remain secured.""  Customer withdrawals have been processed and a security audit is now underway, BitQuick said, a process that could take several weeks.  In the same statement, BitQuick announced that it has been seeking a buyer, a move it said is unrelated to the attack, and cited personal reasons for the decision to sell.  Co-founder and CEO Jad Mubaslat told CoinDesk that the startup has no intention of shutting down for good.  ""BitQuick is certainly not over, that’s for sure. It’s just about how long it will take to figure out the next step for BitQuick,"" he said.

42426715,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJw9hh,1458232839,Coinbase Introduces Stop Orders for Bitcoin Exchange Traders,"Bitcoin services provider Coinbase has added stop orders to its Coinbase Exchange product, allowing customers to buy and sell the digital currency at a previously set price.  Coinbase  describes the service as a way to allow users to protect profits while improving their experience with the exchange product. Since Coinbase launched the exchange in January 2015, it has put an increasing emphasis on the product, indicating in recent messaging that it is first and foremost an exchange product.  In a widely circulated Medium post, CEO Brian Armstrong indicated in February his view that the perception that Coinbase was both a consumer wallet and an exchange product is creating issues for users.  Armstrong wrote:  ""Over the next year or so, you’ll see the Coinbase brand shift from being a hybrid wallet and exchange to focusing on purely being a retail and institutional exchange. It will take some time to update, but the transition will happen.""  As such, the stop loss feature represents the first signal that Coinbase is seeking to publicly follow through on the statements of its CEO.  In his post, Armstrong went on to stress that Coinbase would continue to prioritize its exchange product, and indicated that customers seeking to use its services as a wallet product were likely to continue to experience frustrations.  At press time, Coinbase was reporting 6,680 BTC in 24-hour volume, or about $2.8m, a figure that compares to its regulated US competitors itBit and Gemini, which saw $1.2m and $500,000 in bitcoin exchanged over the previous day’s trading, respectively.

42426713,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJw9dh,1458230040,Tech Giant Hitachi to Study Blockchain in New R&D Lab,"Japanese technology conglomerate Hitachi is set to open a financial technology research laboratory in the US that will focus on blockchain applications.  The research center will open next month in partnership with its technology innovation division based in Silicon Valley, California.  Hitachi indicated that it plans to use the research center as a means to work on initiatives with its customer base. Hitachi operates in a number of industries including IT, consumer electronics and power generation.  Hitachi said in a statement:  ""By establishing the Financial Innovation Laboratory in the Silicon Valley, Hitachi will accelerate research [and] development of blockchain technology, collaborative creation with customers, and development of solutions to support business innovation in financial institutions.""  The announcement marks the latest step in the company’s move toward blockchain applications. Hitachi is member of the Hyperledger Project, an open-source blockchain initiative overseen by the Linux Foundation, having joined in February of this year.  Senior Hitachi researcher Satoshi Oshima sits on the project’s technical steering committee, and also serves in a leadership capacity in Hitachi's internal blockchain efforts. That committee appointed its first chair last month and recently heard a proposal submitted by developers for JPMorgan.

42426696,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJw99h,1458222410,USAA: Members Gave ‘Clear Yes’ to Coinbase Bitcoin Trial,"Financial services giant USAA completed a successful test this week that found it exploring ways to add bitcoin support to its traditional financial monitoring resource.  The trial saw USAA providing its members with the ability to check Coinbase balances directly from their web and mobile accounts, alongside more traditional value monitoring services that track assets such as real estate or automobile investments. Introduced in November, the project is now available to all USAA members.  Speaking to CoinDesk, USAA project lead Darrius Jones indicated that users gave a ‘clear yes’ to the trial, a sign that prompted the company to move quickly in making the service available more widely to its members – many of whom, USAA has said, are bitcoin users.  Jones told CoinDesk:  ""There’s always a gap between feedback and reality. Sometimes highly vocal members who are dogmatic about a capability may or may not represent entirety of the membership. But was this something people wanted.""  Jones said the trial saw impressive growth in sign-ups due to what he described as strong word-of-mouth promotion. Roughly 50% of those who signed up, he noted, were notified about the bitcoin option after hearing about it through emails, tweets and social media.  ""The pilot expanded by 50% just by word of mouth,” he remarked.  Overall, Jones sought to describe the project as one of the fastest completed by USAA, indicating that it took his team just 90 days to introduce the option, respond to user feedback and then release it to its wider membership.  Founded by members of the US military, USAA boasts a strong customer base of military members and their families. The company's work with bitcoin extends beyond the account monitoring option, having taken part in Coinbase's $75m Series C investment round, which closed in January 2015.  Risk and reward  Jones said that the balance check option may not seem sophisticated, but that it was the end result of careful consideration on how the firm could best offer a bitcoin service given that the technology suffers from a lack of regulatory clarity.  ""We chose to focus on a view-only option because that’s the guidance, that’s been the clearest that we can see. We’ve chosen to stay away from transactions and that potential risk,"" he said.  Jones said that given the uncertainty surrounding how the technology could come to be used by consumers, this was perhaps the best way for USAA to proceed. For example, he noted that it’s not clear whether users will want to monitor bitcoin as an investment, as they might a house or car, or whether it will come to be a payment method.  Still, Jones sought to stress that USAA sees bitcoin as part of a larger drive toward digital financial management, and that the Coinbase integration was, at the end of the day, “just another account technology” that allowed it to meet the needs of members.  Jones concluded:  ""We are a member first organization, we try to take that into our development process.""
