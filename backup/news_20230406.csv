Since then, the fundamental Bitcoin setup appears to be improving and Marathon has continued to grow EH/s capacity despite crypto winter. If Bitcoin's rally continues, few public miners are positioned as well as Marathon to benefit from a significant rise in BTC. I last covered Marathon Digital ( MARA ) in late September when the company's share price was $10.77. The main takeaway from that article was both Marathon's debt position and the company's reliance on third parties would lead to underperformance against peers. While MARA's performance since that piece certainly hasn't been the worst of the public miners over the last two quarters, some of the names that I've liked more than MARA have indeed performed better: Data by YCharts Over the last six months, we've seen Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) outperform to the point where it is now the industry leader by market cap. We've also seen a small degree of multiple expansion over the last couple quarters as well in many of these names: Data by YCharts In late September, MARA traded at 1.7x book value and has since doubled to over 3x book. But again, this is not unique to Marathon Digital as just about all of the companies in the chart above have seen their price to book multiple roughly double in the last 6 months. The Bitcoin Setup It's a very different fundamental setup now for a lot of these companies than it was just a few months ago. For instance, the price of natural gas has come back down which has helped put a temporary floor on mining profitability even as hash rate continues to make new highs. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) itself is benefitting from a banking crisis narrative that saw the price of BTC move from roughly $19,500 up to over $29,000 in a matter of about two weeks. BTC Daily (TradingView) There are positive signs technically as well. We're two months from a golden cross of the 50 day over the 200 day moving average and both are still moving higher. We're four weeks from a test and hold of the 200 day and BTC is now attempting to break over resistance that could see it head well above $30k if this rally can continue. Positive signs can be seen in some of Bitcoin's valuation multiples as well. Look Into Bitcoin Bitcoin's Puell Multiple is now well over 1 after being largely beneath 0.5 for the entire second half of 2022. In past cycles, this kind of activity in the Puell Multiple following deep sub-0.5 lows for an extended period of time has often indicated the BTC bottom is in and the next bull cycle isn't far behind. If history repeats, Marathon Digital is well positioned to benefit. March Production & HODL Stack Purely from a Bitcoin treasury perspective, no public miner holds more BTC on the balance sheet than Marathon and very few miners are close to MARA in terms of EH/s mining capacity. Riot is close at 10.5 EH/s as of March. Only Core Scientific ( OTCPK:CORZQ ) has a larger mining operation but that company is going through bankruptcy. Crypto Winter was hard on these companies and the ones that were over-levered were carried out. I suspected Marathon Digital might be a potential casualty as well but I'm less convinced of that if the BTC low is indeed in. We've been getting the March production figures trickling in from the miners over the last few days and by my count we have eight miners that have updated figures. So far, just two public miners produced more BTC in March than in both January and February: Marathon Digital and Cipher Mining ( CIFR ): Monthly BTC Production (Company disclosures) These gains were largely from big increases in EH/s for both companies. MARA exploded higher from 9.5 to 11.5 and CIFR increased more modestly from 5.2 to 5.7. Riot Platforms, CleanSpark ( CLSK ), and Bitfarms ( BITF ) also increased EH/s but to a lesser degree by percentage. MARA didn't just grow production better than peers last month, it had one of the better months by aggregate BTC Treasury growth as well; adding 74 BTC to the balance sheet: February 2023 March 2023 Mo/Mo % RIOT 7,058 7,072 14 0.2% MARA 11,392 11,466 74 0.7% HUT 9,242 9,133 -109 -1.2% BITF 405 435 30 7.4% CLSK 100 196 96 96.0% ARBK 101 85 -16 -15.8% CIFR 465 427 -38 -8.2% Source: Company disclosures From my vantage, there is a clear standout from March and it's Marathon Digital. It's the only company of the eight that have reported growth in both production over January and HODL stack over February. End of March Balances (Marathon Digital) For Marathon, the stack is down 6% from the end of Q4 but what remains is now entirely unencumbered after the company paid down $50 million in debt. We exited the quarter with approximately $124.9 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and 11,466 Bitcoin, the market value of which was approximately $326.5 million on March 31. These are positive signs from a company that still looks pretty rough on paper from a purely fundamental standpoint. However, the fundamentals look much less bad if Bitcoin does continue to rally from here. Risks Like many other miners, Marathon's business was punished last year by a combination of margin squeeze, asset impairment, and problems impacting third parties. Marathon lost an enormous amount of money even after slashing stock based-compensation by over $136 million from 2021 to 2022. If B itcoin's price goes up, Marathon can conceivably claw out of its debt position. But that's still just an ""if"" and possibly a big one if the Fed continues rate hikes. Which is also another ""if"" but that's a topic for a different article. MARA common shares outstanding (Seeking Alpha) Marathon has just under $125 million in cash as of end of March and much of that came through shareholder dilution to close out the year. Common shares outstanding increased by approximately 25% from Q3 to Q4 after going from 116.8 million shares up to 145.6 million common shares outstanding. One final risk to consider is the coming departure of the company's CFO Hugh Gallagher who will be retiring in May. Summary There are several BTC miners that have healthier balance sheets. But there are very few that have the combination of BTC stack and the production capacity that Marathon has. Capacity that the company is continuing to scale through the remainder of 2023. If you're looking for a simple Bitcoin proxy bet that will move up when Bitcoin moves up, MARA should do the trick and possibly to a larger degree than other mining companies that lack the ability to meaningfully scale BTC holdings before the halving. I am still not personally holding MARA shares and I don't plan to buy any at this point. But I do think Marathon has been showing encouraging signs in recent months. I'll also disclose that I am a shareholder of Applied Digital ( APLD ). So, I do have exposure to Marathon indirectly as it is Applied's biggest hosting client. There's still a very large short position in this name. While I'm not buying MARA over RIOT, I don't see Marathon as a sell any longer.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4592755-marathon-digital-has-storm-been-weathered?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/11498227.jpeg

11497847,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=525862,1680822052,"Grayscale Discount Continues To Recover, Good News For Bitcoin?","The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the largest Bitcoin trust in the world, saw a rocky end to the year 2022 after its sister company Genesis Trading filed for bankruptcy. However, it has seen a better start to the year 2023 as it continues to close the gap on its unusually deep discount in December 2022. As the GBTC makes its way back toward parity with BTC spot market prices, could this be good news or bad news for Bitcoin? Grayscale Discount To NAV Shrinks In December 2022, the Grayscale discount to NAV had climbed to almost 50%, recording a new all-time high in the process. This meant that the trust was trading at about a 50% lower price compared to the price of BTC on the spot market. It would then carry this high discount into January 2023 but the tides began to turn as the crypto market saw a recovery. Related Reading: These Cryptocurrencies Are Well-Positioned To See Gains Ahead Of Ethereum’s Upgrade Slowly but steadily, the GBTC discount has been shrinking over the first quarter of 2022. It has since recovered by over 15% during the three-month period, dragging the discount back down into the 30% territory, a new five-month low. On April 5, 2023, the GBTC discount was sitting at 36.9%, although this is not its lowest point so far for 2023. The lowest discount so far for 2023 was reached on March 8 when it dropped to 34.11%. Nevertheless, it is still a long way from its 2022 highs. GBTC discount falls to 36.9% | Source: YCharts Likewise, the discount to NAV on the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) has been recovering in 2023. ETHE closed out 2022 with an all-time high discount of 59.62%, but by April 5, it has dropped to 50.92%, with the lowest discount for the year so far being 46.88% recorded on March 9, 2023. GBTC Recovery Good For Bitcoin? The Bitcoin price suffered from the uncertainty surrounding Grayscale Bitcoin Trust last year because the trust currently holds over 600,000 BTC which it holds with the Coinbase Custody service. Most of the uncertainty was surrounding whether the contagion from Genesis Trading filing for bankruptcy would spread to the trust. GBTC’s team had, however, pacified investors when it revealed that the trust was operated independently and so far, the trust has been able to continue operations. The closing of the discount gap also shows that investor confidence is returning and the GBTC is recovering. BTC falls below $28,000 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com One thing that continues to hold the trust back though is its lawsuit with the Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) after the regulator denied its filing to turn the trust into a Bitcoin Spot ETF for the second time. The lawsuit is still ongoing but if Grayscale were to emerge victorious, it would be a momentous win for the space and BTC’s price would more likely than not react positively to such news as it would be the first BTC spot ETF in the United States.

Despite these setbacks, Solana has announced a major innovation with a new feature called “State Compression.” This new solution aims to lower the minting costs for NFTs, which have been a major barrier to entry for many creators and users. By reducing the costs of creating and trading NFTs, Solana’s state compression technology now has the potential to unlock new opportunities in the NFT market and make it more accessible to a wider audience. Related Reading: Woes For Bitcoin And Ethereum As Price Weakens, Which Direction Will Prevail? NFT Market Set To Grow With Solana’s State Compression Traditionally, data on the blockchain is stored in an uncompressed format, which can be space-consuming and costly. Solana’s state compression technology is a solution that reduces the amount of storage required for storing data on the blockchain. This is achieved by compressing the data before it is stored on-chain, making it more efficient and cost-effective. In addition to reducing storage costs, Solana’s state compression technology can also improve the overall efficiency of the blockchain. By compressing data, it becomes easier and faster to process, reducing the time and resources that are required to execute transactions. This can improve the overall speed and scalability of the blockchain, making it a more attractive platform for building decentralized applications (DeFi). Solana’s state compression technology has significant implications for the NFT market, particularly in reducing the cost and complexity of creating NFTs. According to Solana’s announcement, the most important implication of this technology is “compressed” NFTs, which are similar to regular NFTs but much cheaper to mint and store on-chain. Per the announcement, compressed NFTs are created by compressing the data stored on the blockchain, drastically reducing the amount of storage required; the feature makes it much more affordable for creators and users to participate in the NFT market. Compressed NFTs may be a game-changer for the NFT market, making it much more affordable for creators and users to participate. Using Solana’s state compression technology, developers can create and trade NFTs at a fraction of the cost of traditional NFTs, opening up new opportunities for innovation and growth in the NFT market. Solana’s native token SOL has breached the $21 level, but it is currently trading at $20.60, representing a 1.2% decline from the previous 24 hours. The current resistance for SOL is located at the $21.32 mark. If the price surpasses this level, it could regain its bullish momentum and aim for its yearly high of $27, achieved in January. On the other hand, the current support level for SOL is $20.69, which has remained firm since its decline in the last 24 hours. If this support level persists, SOL could maintain its bullish trend and potentially surge to higher levels in the upcoming days.

Even so, cryptocurrency-exposed stocks finished the session mixed as the broader stock market closed modestly higher . The token slipped 0.6% to $28.01K at 5:08 p.m. ET and remained in a tight range of $26.7K-29K that's persisted since the start of the tumult in the banking sector last month. Similarly, ethereum ( ETH-USD ) edged down 2.4% to $1.86K. Earlier, Ryan Wilday, founder of Crypto Waves Investing Group, laid out his price targets for the two largest cryptos by market cap -- bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ether ( ETH-USD ) -- in Investing Experts Podcast. The jobs report, due out on Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET, will provide investors clues on whether the Federal Reserve might continue with its interest-rate hikes or pause such increases. That's been a big debate in recent weeks as the fallout from the banking turmoil, along with a moderation in certain economic data, fueled recession jitters yet again. According to consensus estimates, economists expect the U.S. economy added 238K jobs last month, down from the 311K reported for February and from the blowout January number of over 500K. Should March's print come in hotter than expected, signaling a still-resilient labor market, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and other major cryptos could catch a bid. The opposite might hold true, however, if the reading falls short of expectations. Crypto-related stocks, meantime, ended the session mixed: MicroStrategy ( MSTR ), -0.3% , Coinbase Global ( COIN ), +1.1% , BIT Mining ( BTCM ), -2.1% , Bit Digital ( BTBT ), +3.4% , Silvergate Capital ( SI ), -2.7% , and CleanSpark ( CLSK ), -2% . Note that the stock market will be closed Friday in observance of Good Friday. Daniel Jones, investing group leader of 'Crude Value Insights,' attributed bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) recent climb to ""a more speculation-friendly market that is perceived to be around the corner,"" ultimately calling the token ""drastically overvalued.""

42411002,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ghvTq7,1680814338,Crypto Investors Unmoved by Revised Jobless Data,"Crypto markets traded quietly ahead of the U.S. Easter holiday and following Thursday’s initial jobless claims data release. A change in the prior week’s figures implies that crypto traders have either been acting on incomplete information, or don’t see the information as particularly significant.  For the week ending April 1, 228,000 Americans filed for unemployment, 11% higher than the consensus estimate of 205,000. The report also showed that jobless claims for the week ending March 25 were revised sharply higher from 198,000 to 246,000.  The U.S. Department of Labor attributed the revision to changes in the methodology for seasonality adjustment. As a result, current jobless claims declined by 18,000, in comparison to the revised figure.  With the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) routinely characterizing the labor market as “very tight,” the decline this week is the opposite of what Federal Reserve officials would like to see.  The revision higher for last week appears to align with what FOMC members want to see, too.  It also raises the question whether today’s number is understated, which could potentially lead to a revision higher in next week’s release. Trading activity last week likely did not incorporate the revised figures that were released today.  Bitcoin’s (BTC) price on the day of the prior release (March 30) shows a relatively mild decline of 0.93%. Ether's (ETH) movement was even less significant, falling just 0.04%.  Overall, bitcoin’s price is roughly identical to where it was last Thursday, while ETH is 4.5% higher.  Thus far, neither bitcoin nor ether are trading in a way that suggests the jobs data revision is affecting investors. Conventional wisdom would have suggested that the change would have had a bullish impact on prices.  It could also indicate that crypto investors are unconcerned by the higher, revised number that still fell within a range of acceptable expectations. Friday’s non-farm payrolls data will likely provide additional insights.

42412383,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4nPi,1680814071,Venture Capital Bitkraft Raises $220.6M for Second 'Token' Fund: Filing,"Gaming-focused venture capital firm Bitkraft raised $220.6 million for its second ""token fund,"" which had a total target of $240 million, according to a March 30 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  The firm launched a similar fund in October 2021, with $75 million in committed capital thatwas seeking to invest in blockchain gaming and digital entertainment.  For the new fund, however, Bitkraft couldn’t comment on the nature of the investment mandate but partner Carlos Pereira outlined the firm’s general Web3 investment strategy during an interview with CoinDesk.  Founded in 2016 by gaming and esports veteran Jens Hilgers, Bitkraft focuses on seed through Series B investments in game studios, gaming platforms and game-related technology across both Web2 and Web3.  Bitkraft has grown to approximately $600 million in assets under management (with one-third devoted to Web3 opportunities) and has become an registered investment advisor. The firm’s funds have included an esports-focused and a general venture capital fund and the two ""token"" funds.  “We’re gaming investors, first and foremost, with an operating and investing background that precedes the Web3 gaming bull run by a lot,” said Pereira. “We’re focused on underwriting great games with the tools that we have. Now in crypto, with the experience that we have as players, we want to see the economic rails evolve,” he added.  Investment strategy  Pereira said Bitkraft’s move into gaming was motivated by the team’s experience as gamers rather than a desire to get in on the GameFi boom that hit in 2021 as play-to-earn titles like Axie Infinity made numerous headlines – and dollars.  Bitkraft brings a background in funding Web2 studios that build complex environments and are looking for similar Web3 projects. The firm favors developers that have a higher-than-average amount of experience, often gained through decades of experience at Web2 studios.  Bitkraft’s recent investments have included Eve Online developer CCP Games and blockchain-enabled mobile game developer Jungle. The firm's investments happen through a combination of equity and token purchases.  “If we own both the equity and the token, we can design a game that maximizes value creation through primary sales and maximizes value creation through secondary sales,” explained Pereira, noting the importance of “figuring out a business model that works and allocating that value between equity and tokens.”  The bull market of 2021 attracted new game developers to the Web3 space, who received venture capital backing through the first half of 2022. Despite the bear market that followed, that narrative hasn't finished playing out yet. Those developers are still in the early stages of their two- to four-year development cycles, Pereira noted.

42412378,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4nMu,1680813399,Ether Holds Near $1.9K as Shanghai Fork Approaches,"Ether (ETH) retreated below $1,900 on Thursday a day after surpassing this threshold and reaching its highest level since last August.  The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $1,876, off 1.5% over the past 24 hours. Still, ETH has gained over 4% for the past seven days as market participants eye Ethereum’s April 12 Shanghai hard fork, which aims to address staked ETH withdrawals.  After rising the day before, liquid staking tokens flattened on Thursday. LDO, the governance token of the decentralized autonomous organization behind Lido, dropped by 3% for the day to hover around $2.50 on Thursday. The price drop came after a Lido protocol developer said in a Twitter Space Thursday that Lido stakers can expect their ETH withdrawals “no sooner than early May.” Rocket Poll’s RPL token was down 2.9% to trade near $46, according to CoinGecko data.  How the Shanghai fork affects ether’s price remains uncertain, with some observers expecting selling pressure but others expecting a surge amid fresh interest in the Ethereum platform. Gökçe Guven, the co-founder and CEO of Kalder, said the ability to freely stake and unstake will “add a tremendous amount of utility” and in turn likely attract growing institutional interest.  “Larger institutional players often base whether or not they choose to get exposure to a certain asset class on whether there is the option to get yield,” Guven told CoinDesk in an email, adding: “Staking – but also, now, the ability to unstake – provides that option now.”  And crypto research firm Delphi Digital's research analysts said in a note Thursday that Shanghai has created a timeline for stakers to withdraw their locked-up ETH holdings, and that more investors will “prefer to stake ETH rather than keeping their assets idle.”  “Liquid staking protocols, including Lido, are in the best position to capture these flows,” the analysts added.  Elsewhere in markets  Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market value, was changing hands at around $28,100, down 0.1% from Wednesday, same time. BTC has been range-bound between $27,200 and $28,200 for much of the past three weeks.  The CoinDesk Market Index, which measures overall crypto market performance, was recently off 1% from a day ago.  Brendon Sedo, a contributor to layer 1 blockchain Core DAO, highlighted in an email to CoinDesk that with the demands for bitcoin rising, miners increase profitability, leading to “growing competition” among them “to secure the Bitcoin network.”  “It’s a positive reinforcement loop that we’re witnessing in real time,” he added.  Major stock indexes turned green as investors awaited Friday’s U.S. Labor Department’s nonfarm payrolls (NFP) job report for March. The S&P 500 closed up 0.3% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 0.7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was flat.  The two-year and 10-year Treasury rates were flat on Thursday, recently sitting at 3.82% and 3.29%, respectively.  Equity markets will be closed in the U.S. Friday for the Good Friday observance.  “When a plethora of markets will be closed, we will see if traders will look to take advantage of the one market that trades 365 days a year,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in an email Thursday. “Bitcoin remains near the upper boundaries of its trading range and could see a good chance to breach the $30,000 level over the weekend when some of its derivatives are not actively trading.”  Moya added: “If the NFP report misses massively and supports the idea that the economy is in worse shape, we could see that provide a major boost for crypto.”",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/06/ether-holds-near-19k-as-shanghai-fork-approaches,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9e63f491b0d326f64e5e2130870b9596484e31d6-1134x580.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410807,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggrhUX,1680811981,From Nakamigos to Magamigos: The Tricky Relationship Between the Meme Economy and NFTs,"While current non-fungible token (NFT) market conditions are far from where they were at the height of the bull market, NFT traders continue to fervently pump money into the ecosystem. Established projects, such as Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and Azuki, have maintained trading momentum by releasing new products, while other lesser-known creators have taken advantage of mechanics including open edition mints and dynamic NFTs to spark intrigue.  Still, major brand deals and high-ticket NFT sales have slowed, and new projects finding widespread appeal are few and far between in 2023. In recent months we’ve seen an uptick of projects that reference meme culture and current events, including Jack Butcher’s popular Checks VV and Mason Rothschild’s This Artwork is Subject to Change, though other meme projects that once captivated traders, like Art Gobblers and Goblintown, have experienced a steady decline in trading.  With this context in mind, the overnight success of Nakamigos, a 20,000-edition NFT project featuring pixelated avatars, has bewildered some analysts and traders. Launched last month, the project taps into the name of Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, and added the Spanish word for friend “amigo” to create Nakamigos, and leveraged art for the collection that nods at the pixelated profile picture (PFP) collection CryptoPunks. Nakamigos quickly gained popularity and reportedly outpaced Bored Ape Yacht Club in the number of lifetime trades within days of its mint. At the time of writing, the project has done 21,035 ether (ETH) in trading, or about $39 million, and has a floor price of 0.5 ETH, or about $930.  Soon after Nakamigos’ successful launch, several derivative projects referencing Nakamigos began to crop up, including Nakamigas, a series of female-presenting pixelated avatars, and Magamigos, a collection of 5,000 pixelated avatars depicting former President Donald Trump in the wake of his indictment.  These projects offer onlookers a lesson in understanding NFT trends in real time. And while the NFT market welcomes a boost in trading volume brought about by new, hyped-up projects, the impact usually remains short term and follows a familiar playbook of copycat projects glomming onto a trend.  Understanding the Nakamigos hype cycle  Nakamigos was created in March 2023 by an anonymous collective called HiFo Labs. Little is known about the project’s founders, although according to a blog post it was created by an “‘OG’ crypto artist with many years of experience in digital art.” Rumors spread that the project was connected to CryptoPunks creator Larva Labs because of its aesthetic, though its founders quickly shut down the idea.  The collection grants holders full commercial rights to their characters. Early on, the project partnered with NFT influencer Sartoshi, creator of the popular mfers NFT collection, on marketing, allowing holders of the end of Sartoshi (eos) NFT collection to claim free Nakamigos at mint.  The project’s enormous growth in such a short span of time is likely tied to clever marketing and its connection to Sartoshi. In a public stunt, the Nakamigos team gifted 24 NFTs to major crypto influencers including Art Blocks creator Erick Calderon, NFT trader DJ Seedphrase and artist XCOPY that were created in their likeness, going as far as to amplify the act via a paid exposure campaign.  Notably, NFT artist Beeple, who has a history of parodying projects and pop culture in his own work, pledged to create “chapter 2” for Nakamigos if its floor price hit 1 ETH. As of writing, it hasn't.  It’s unclear if Nakamigos will offer greater utility or long-term value for holders that swept up these NFTs in a frenzy. In any case, it provides a glimpse into how new NFT projects can seduce traders and cement their projects into memedome.  “The rise of Nakamigos is a prime example of how marketing can have a significant impact on the value of these digital assets,” writes DappRadar. “Nakamigos’ successful marketing strategy leveraging Twitter influencers has driven demand and sales despite the project not having any concrete plans at the moment.”  Magamigos and the shady world of derivative NFTs  The proliferation of meme projects can be good for the NFT ecosystem – we’ve seen sporadic spikes in trading volume and sales over the last few months, according to Nansen. But as our proclivity for hype takes hold, opportunistic sellers will often clutter the space with low-brow derivative projects that are often devoid of long-term value, or worse, end up being a rug pull.  In the hours after former President Donald Trump was arraigned in New York on Tuesday afternoon, his Trump Digital Trading Card collection experienced a brief jump in sales following months of stagnant trading. The project, which has done over 13,432 ETH (about $25 million) in trading since its release in December, has been able to capitalize on its cultural relevance and attachment to the 45th U.S. president, despite its shady origins, reliance on stock imagery and so far unfulfilled promises of prizes like a zoom call with Trump or dinner at Mar-a-Lago, neither of which have happened.  The Trump Digital Trading Card project has since inspired other meme NFT collections that cannibalize its trendiness: There are Trump Criminal Digital Cards that depict the former president in a prison uniform, Donald Trump Yacht Club, which takes inspiration from BAYC, MagaPunk, a collection of CryptoPunk-like characters with Trump-like traits. And the list goes on.  Magamigos, which takes elements of the Nakamigos art style and the Trump Trading Cards traits, minted in the hours following Trump’s arraignment and quickly made its way to OpenSea’s trending page with the tagline “Make NFTs Great Again,” a nod to Trump’s MAGA base.  Despite the fact that Magamigos doesn’t have a website, let alone a white paper or road map, and seems to offer no utility for holders, the project managed to secure 150 ETH in trading volume, or about $279,000. Its Twitter account, which launched moments before its mint, even conducted a giveaway for a Nakamigos NFT, which garnered dozens of comments and likes.  There are projects, like Checks VV, that have encouraged and even promoted derivative projects as a marketing tool. Humanity Checks, an open-edition NFT collection in the same style as creator Jack Butcher’s original Checks VV, was created to raise funds for Doctors Without Borders following the destructive earthquake in Turkey and Syria in February.  But other projects have used their resemblance to legitimate projects to scam unsuspecting collectors. In January 2022, after the success of NFT giant Yuga Labs’ Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) collection, NFT creator Aurelian Michel created the Mutant Ape Planet collection, featuring a familiar name and monkey-themed PFPs. But shortly after, Michel was arrested by French authorities for facilitating a $2.9 million rug pull after he failed to deliver on any of the many promises made about the collection.  Doing it for the memes  The nature of internet memes is that they have a short lifespan of going viral that produces brief but meteoric results. In some ways, the fleeting nature is partially what drives people to continue producing memes, keeping internet culture thriving.  It’s the same internet culture of memes that has inspired popular cryptocurrencies (aka meme coins) such as dogecoin and shiba inu coin and popularized crypto slang like HODL and gm, and even inspired celebrities to add “laser eyes” to their Twitter profile pictures to signal an allegiance to bitcoin.  Not all memes are bad. Pepe the Frog, for example, has been transformed from a racist dog whistle into an emblem of crypto resilience and has been splattered across many NFT projects.  Sergio Silva, senior director of business development at crypto custody firm Fireblocks and creator of meme-driven NFT collection Seize the Meebs, told CoinDesk that in order to understand the intersection of memes and crypto, it’s necessary to revisit the definition of a meme.  “A meme is this idea that through its virality, it becomes socially accepted that it represents something,” said Silva. “In the world that we live in with NFT communities mostly congregating around visual objects or JPEGs, memes in crypto become different illustrations of different things that we are constantly repeating to ourselves, which we are using whether we do it consciously or subconsciously to propagate the culture.”  Silva said the nature of memes being entertaining and easy to understand create a “double-edged sword” in the NFT space.  On one end, the highly speculative nature of digital assets that are tethered to memes can create massive onboarding ramps for NFT adoption, as non-natives who identify with the meme in a collection may finally feel a strong enough connection to buy their first NFT. Trump’s Digital Trading Cards, for example, showed strong evidence that the majority of buyers at mint were purchasing their first NFT. That said, it’s important to note these collections are often risky, with shaky road maps and uncertain deliverables that ultimately pump and dump by the time internet users are already eyeing their next meme.  On the other end of the sword, without memes NFT markets would operate much differently. Communities wouldn’t be brought together around the shared love of an internet trend and, instead, celebrities might take the lead in pumping projects, which has previously been detrimental to adoption. In October, the Securities and Exchange Commission fined Kim Kardashian $1.2 million for promoting cryptocurrency ethereumMax and failing to disclose that she was compensated for doing so.

11506594,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=525938,1680811754,XRP Bullish Streak Comes To A Halt With 8% Dip,"XRP, the digital currency associated with Ripple, started off strong on Wednesday with a promising gain of nearly 2%, holding steady above the safe $0.50 mark. However, early Thursday morning, XRP tumbled to $0.49 levels, signaling a choppy and uncertain trading day. As the coin’s value hangs in the balance, the outcome of the Ripple vs. SEC case could have far-reaching consequences for both the cryptocurrency market and Ripple’s future. The abrupt dip raises the question: are investors losing faith in the ongoing case — or is this merely a temporary blip on XRP’s upward trajectory? Related Reading: These Top 5 Meme Coins Are Bleeding As March 2023 Ends – Here’s Why XRP Experiences Short-Term Dip, But Long-Term Outlook Remains Positive According to Coingecko data, XRP is currently priced at $0.496676, experiencing a slight 0.6% dip in the past 24 hours and a more significant 8.5% dip in the last seven days. However, despite recent setbacks, the digital asset has still managed to register an impressive 30-day rally of 35.2%. Market onlookers have been keeping a watchful eye on the Ripple case, with many expressing optimism that it will result in a positive outcome for the company. This sentiment has spurred a surge in XRP’s price in recent weeks, as investors eagerly anticipate the resolution of the ongoing legal battle. Despite the recent dips, XRP’s impressive 30-day rally can be attributed to the bullish sentiment surrounding the Ripple case, and many are eagerly awaiting further developments in the coming weeks. XRP’s Path To Bullishness As per TradingView charts, XRP’s short-term prospects are reliant on breaking through the pivot point of $0.5106 to set sights on the first major resistance level at $0.5223, and ultimately target Wednesday’s high of $0.52646. A return to $0.5150 would indicate an optimistic session. However, for the breakout to be sustained, the Ripple vs. SEC narrative must continue to bolster XRP. If the pivot point is not breached, XRP risks falling to the first major support level at $0.4947. However, as long as the selling pressure remains under control, the coin should hold steady above sub-$0.4850 and the second MSL at $0.4830.

The market seems on the verge of a major move as prices consolidate and move sideways, but what can operate as a catalyzed? Related Reading: BNB Remains Under Pressure As Regulators Crack Down On Binance As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $28,000 with a minor loss over the past seven days. In this timeframe, Ethereum continues to lead the market with a 4% gain. Only Dogecoin (DOGE), the king of meme coins, retains bullish momentum with an 18% profit. Ethereum Upgrades, Bitcoin Stall, And Macro Factors Gain Relevance Per data from crypto analysis firm Blofin, Ethereum has been and will continue outperforming Bitcoin in the short term. The second crypto by market cap is on the verge of implementing a major upgrade, Shapella, on April 12. This update represents the most important for ETH since “The Merge” and marks Ethereum’s full migration into a proof-of-stake protocol. The upgrade will allow ETH users to un-stake their assets from the “Beacon Chain.” This event has triggered a lot of speculation in the market about the potential impact on ETH’s price. However, Blofin noted that investors’ expectations, as measured by a flat Implied Volatility (IV) in the options market, “remain relatively stable” ahead of Shapella. The firm pointed out: Despite the lackluster performance of the crypto market, investor expectations remain relatively stable. IVs remain flat and slightly declining, while skewness indicates investors’ relative bullishness towards the mid-to-long-term performance of mainstream cryptos. In the options sector, the firm recorded a minor uptick in the number of traders purchasing call (buy/long) contracts ahead of the event, but the sentiment is decisively neutral. Blofin believes traders are on the expectation of “more new data to make decisions.” The Shapella upgrade and macroeconomic factors have triggered uncertainty in the market. These variables could usher changes in the crypto sector. In 2023, Bitcoin and Ethereum broke out of their correlation with the traditional market. Following a year of trading in tandem, the cryptocurrencies climbed from massive losses and regained previously lost territory. The correlation with equities, namely the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100, could return as the macroeconomic landscape takes a turn for a recession. Data published by the U.S. today, according to Blofin, hints that this scenario is becoming more likely. Related Reading: Ethereum Shapella Upgrade Expected To Boost Liquid Staking Protocols While the short term is uncertain and could see BTC and ETH display more weakness, the mid and long-term are skew towards the long side, Blofin said: Recession trading appears to be one of the reasons for the recent weakness in BTC prices.

At the time of writing, however, it encountered selling pressure. The coin lost 0.7% of its value in the last 24 hours, indicating consolidation on the chart and erasing most of its gains from the past week. The technical outlook showed that the bullish strength of the coin was weakening due to a decline in the number of buyers due to a decrease in demand and accumulation. Unless the demand remains positive, the coin may fall below its immediate support level, bringing in the bears. Related Reading: Dogecoin Dominates Top 10 Crypto Roster With 20% Rally In Last 7 Days However, if the demand remains positive, the bulls may attempt to increase the price. LINK has two crucial support levels. Its performance depends on the broader market strength, which has been uncertain as Bitcoin fluctuates above and below the $28,500 price mark, leading to confusion on most altcoin charts. Chainlink Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, LINK was trading at $7.20. Having recently appreciated above the $7 mark, the initial bullish trend was short-lived. The $7.20 level had acted as a strong resistance zone for the altcoin, thwarting every attempt by the bulls to push the price up. The coin’s overhead resistance was $7.60, and breaking through it could take LINK to $8. However, the altcoin’s performance highly depends on its support levels, with the first being at $7. Falling below this level would lead to further drops to $6.80 and then $6.40, both of which present buying opportunities for traders. In the last session, the amount of LINK traded was negative, indicating a rise in selling pressure. Technical Analysis Sellers are attempting to take over the price of LINK, leading to a dip in demand on the coin’s one-day chart. The Relative Strength Index has also fallen close to the half-line, indicating buyers are starting to exit the market. Further drops in demand may attract more sellers to the chart. Additionally, the altcoin price has recently fallen below the 20-Simple Moving Average line, suggesting a depreciation in demand and indicating that sellers are driving the market momentum. However, a slight push above the $7.20 mark could help LINK regain momentum and lift its price back above the 20-SMA line. LINK is showing a decline in buy signals due to falling demand. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicates price momentum and reversals. It has formed shorter green signal bars that correspond to the decrease in buy signals for LINK.

Uniswap handled more than $70 billion of trading in March, exceeding centralized exchange (CEX) Coinbase’s $49.2 billion, according to CCData (the company formerly known as CryptoCompare.) The surge coincided with overall DEX volume surging to a 10-month high.

Also, Silicon Valley Bank’s (SVB) collapse drove two key parts of decentralized finance (DeFi) – Circle Internet Financial’s USD coin (USDC) and MakerDAO’s DAI – down from their customary price of $1, prompting a flurry of DEX trading as scared investors shifted money around. Amid that crisis, Uniswap saw $13.3 billion of volume on March 11, whereas Coinbase had $1.7 billion.

11488901,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=525909,1680802358,Ethereum Shapella Upgrade Expected To Boost Liquid Staking Protocols,"In decentralized finance (DeFi), Ethereum (ETH) liquid staking has become a significant market valued at over $15 billion. This market is set to see a significant boost with the upcoming Shapella upgrade, which is expected to unlock the entire liquid staking market in less than a week, according to DeFi researcher Thor Hartvigsen. Liquid staking allows users to earn staking rewards while maintaining the flexibility to use their stakes assets for other purposes. It’s a win-win situation for both the protocol and the user, as it helps to secure Ethereum’s network while generating additional revenue for the user. With this said, what protocols are better positioned to benefit from the next Ethereum Shapella upgrade? Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Rally Further? Here’s What On-Chain-Data Says 3 Protocols To Watch Ahead Of Ethereum Shapella Upgrade Liquid staking has become an increasingly popular way for investors to earn rewards on their Ethereum holdings while maintaining flexibility in their usage. According to Hartvigsen, since the start of the year, the total amount of ETH staked via liquid staking has increased by a significant 21%, from 6.8 million to over 8 million ETH. However, despite the benefits of liquid staking, there has been a lingering concern among investors regarding the risk of being unable to unstaked or redeem their liquid-staked assets at their true value. Fortunately, the upcoming Shapella upgrade is set to address these issues. According to Hartvigsen, few protocols have gained market share and are well positioned to continue the increasing trend of liquid staking post-Shapella. These protocols include: Rocket Pool is a DeFi staking network that allows users to stake any amount of ETH, regardless of the size of their holdings. The platform has been gaining traction in the market, as evidenced by its recent Q1 stats. In the first quarter of the year, Rocket Pool saw an inflow of 90,000 ETH staked on the protocol, a significant increase from the previous quarter and indicative of the growing demand for liquid staking services. Rocket Pool’s market share increased from 4.9% to 5.3% in the first quarter. Lido Finance is a liquid staking protocol that allows users to stake their ETH and receive a tokenized representation of their staked ETH, known as stETH. The platform has been gaining momentum in the market. In the first months of the year, Lido Finance saw an inflow of 1.09 million ETH staked on the protocol, representing a significant increase of over 22% from the previous quarter. Despite a slight decrease in market share from 74% to 72%, Lido Finance remains a dominant player in the liquid staking market, according to Hartvigsen. In addition, Lido Finance’s native token, LDOUSD, has seen a significant increase in value. It has risen by 152% in the first quarter. StakeWise is also well-positioned ahead of the upcoming Shapella upgrade. StakeWise is a prominent DeFi staking platform that allows users to stake ETH and receive a fixed interest rate. The platform has been steadily gaining popularity in the market. In Q1, StakeWise saw an inflow of 10,000 ETH staked on the protocol, according to Hartvigsen, representing a solid increase of 12% from the end of 2023. Furthermore, the platform generated $1.68 million in fees during the first quarter. In addition to its strong market performance, StakeWise’s native token, SWISEUSD, has seen a significant increase in value, which has risen 128% in the first quarter of 2023. According to Hartvigsen, as the Ethereum liquid staking market expands, each protocol has arguments for future growth. According to the researcher, the ETH liquid staking market is set to experience significant growth in the coming months and years.

Nonetheless, developments are made to increase the burn rate of the token. NFTs Might Help With LUNC Burn Cremation Coin, a protocol specifically built for burning cryptos with astronomical supply numbers, is considering the use of NFTs to help the burn rate of the LUNC token.

42411166,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glLQ9s,1680796889,Ripple's Effect on Financial Advisors,"The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple, related to the sale of the XRP token, has been one of the most controversial and hotly debated topics in the cryptocurrency industry. The lawsuit alleges Ripple conducted an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP, which is the cryptocurrency used by the Ripple network. The case has been closely watched by the cryptocurrency community because of the potential implications for the classification of cryptocurrencies as securities.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.  What is Ripple and XRP?  Ripple is a San Francisco-based technology company that was founded in 2012. Ripple's primary goal is to create a global payment system that can facilitate fast and low-cost cross-border payments. The company has developed a payment protocol called the Ripple Protocol, which is designed to facilitate real-time gross settlement (RTGS) of funds between financial institutions. Ripple's payment network uses XRP, which is a digital asset that is designed to serve as a bridge currency for cross-border payments.  XRP is the native cryptocurrency of the XRP Ledger and was designed to rival Bitcoin and other blockchain networks. It is used by Ripple to facilitate transactions on the Ripple network and can be traded on various cryptocurrency exchanges. XRP is designed to be a fast and low-cost way to transfer value across borders. The Ripple network uses XRP to provide liquidity for cross-border payments, which can help to reduce the time and cost of transactions.  Read more: Open Interest in XRP Surges to $800M as Crypto Traders Hope Ripple-SEC Verdict Will Bring 'Alt Season'  The lawsuit  In December 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs Inc., CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Chairman Chris Larsen. The lawsuit alleges Ripple conducted an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP. The SEC argues XRP is a security and should have been registered with the agency before it was sold to investors.  Ripple has denied the allegations and has been fighting the lawsuit in court, which Garlinghouse has predicted in an interview held during CoinDesk’s Consensus 2022 conference that Ripple will have spent “over $100 million on legal fees fighting the SEC.” The company argues that XRP is not a security but a digital asset that serves as a bridge currency for cross-border payments. Ripple also claims the SEC's actions against the company are arbitrary and capricious and that the agency has created regulatory uncertainty in the cryptocurrency industry.  Read more: Ripple Had ‘Some Exposure’ to Silicon Valley Bank, Says CEO  XRP removed from exchanges  One of the immediate impacts of the SEC lawsuit against Ripple and XRP was that several cryptocurrency exchanges delisted or suspended trading of XRP. The delisting of XRP was a significant blow to the cryptocurrency's market value because it led to a sharp decline in trading volume and price.  The removal of XRP from these exchanges was due to concerns over the potential classification of XRP as a security. Exchanges that list securities are subject to more stringent regulations and oversight, which can create additional costs and legal risks. The delisting of XRP highlights the potential risks associated with investing in cryptocurrencies and the importance of regulatory clarity for the cryptocurrency industry.  John Deaton's intervention  In the middle of the case, attorney John Deaton was granted permission by a federal judge to enter the SEC case as an outside advisor (amicus curiae). As of today he is representing roughly 75,000 XRP holders who believe XRP is not a security and that the SEC's actions have caused significant harm to XRP holders. This intervention has caused further debate in the cryptocurrency industry regarding the classification of XRP and the SEC's actions against Ripple.  At the end of 2022, over a dozen other major crypto industry supporters, such as Coinbase, joined in by filing “friend of the court” briefs in support of Ripple.  Implications for financial advisors  Financial advisors should care about the outcome of the SEC lawsuit against Ripple and XRP because it could have significant implications for their clients and the entire financial industry. If XRP is deemed a security, it could lead to increased regulatory oversight and restrictions on the use of cryptocurrencies. This could negatively impact the value of XRP and other cryptocurrencies and create legal and regulatory uncertainty in the cryptocurrency industry that could make its way into traditional finance.  Financial advisors may need to reassess their recommendations regarding cryptocurrencies if they become subject to more regulatory oversight and restrictions. Advisors who have recommended XRP or other cryptocurrencies to their clients may need to inform them about the potential risks associated with these investments and discuss strategies for managing these risks.  The outcome of this lawsuit could have broader implications for the traditional financial world. It could create a more restrictive regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICO), making it more difficult for financial institutions to adopt and integrate these assets into their operations. This could limit the potential benefits that cryptocurrencies could bring, such as faster and cheaper cross-border payments.  The lawsuit is not, however, just about XRP. Instead, it is about the broader question of whether cryptocurrencies are securities and a redefining of the question, “What is a security?” If the court decides XRP is a security, it could set a precedent for the classification of many different types of assets, not just cryptocurrencies. This could create significant uncertainty in the cryptocurrency industry and could lead to a more restrictive regulatory environment, which could potentially lead to the United States falling behind in this new technology to other countries that have embraced it.",NEUTRAL,XRP,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | XRP | TOKEN SALE,DJ Windle,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/04/06/ripples-effect-on-financial-advisors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6cb997b5ccaa16ceb29587438cc05be88b523af4-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42413999,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAsxB7,1680796800,Magic Eden Rolls Out Bitcoin Ordinals NFT Creator Launchpad,"Non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace Magic Eden said Thursday it’s rolling out a creator launchpad for Ordinals, helping creators successfully inscribe their Bitcoin-based NFT collections.  While the company already has the infrastructure for creators to list and sell Ordinals, the launchpad will help onboard creators to the ecosystem to easily facilitate the creation of tokens on the Bitcoin network. The process of inscribing an Ordinal NFT is far different from minting a digital asset on Ethereum, which poses a barrier to entry for many creators who aren’t familiar with the intricacies of Taproot and inscriptions. This led Magic Eden to find a way to help ease the process for the growing market of Ordinals collectors.  See Also: Crypto Custody Firm BitGo Releases Security Features Aimed at Bitcoin Ordinals  Zhuoxun Yin, chief operating officer and co-founder of Magic Eden, said in a press release that helping creators to mint Ordinals will help grow a larger market for tokenized assets on Bitcoin.  “Bitcoin is the grandfather of all blockchains, and we believe it can be the home to pure digital artifacts,” said Yin. “With Ordinals, content can be preserved forever, and we're proud to be helping creators and the Ordinals community grow together.""  To kick off its launchpad, Magic Eden is teaming with Ethereum-based NFT collection Godjira to release its Bitcoin-based (Dead)Jira collection on April 7. The company has also tapped creators Genopets, Lazy Lions, Humanoids and rapper Lil Durk to mint Bitcoin inscriptions on the new platform within the next week.  The excitement around Ordinals has grown since January and Magic Eden has been ready to embrace the growing market for inscriptions. Last month, Magic Eden released a Bitcoin NFT marketplace, allowing collectors to purchase Ordinals on the secondary market, integrating support for two Bitcoin wallets in doing so.  ""We're on the ground level listening to what is needed from all of these subgroups of the Ordinals community, and we will look to deliver on those needs,"" said Head of Marketing at Magic Eden, Tiffany Huang. ""We think involvement of our expertise and resources is much needed to continue the growth of Ordinals and encourage a flourishing ecosystem.""  Outside of the Bitcoin network, Magic Eden has made an effort to expand its offerings outside of Solana, the layer 1 blockchain that put the marketplace on the map. Days after rolling out its Bitcoin NFT marketplace, Magic Eden established a Web3 gaming collective, bringing together leading blockchain-based game funds and publishers to help foster adoption in the space. Earlier in March, it kicked off ""Mint Madness,"" allowing users to mint free NFTs for over a dozen Web3 games.

42414004,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAsxWL,1680796800,Multicoin Leads $4M Strategic Round for Web3 Co-Ownership Platform Lore,"San Francisco-based Lore, a co-ownership platform for Web3 collectives, has raised $4 million in a strategic funding round led by Multicoin Capital. The capital will enable new use cases and expansion to additional blockchains beyond Ethereum, starting with Polygon and Solana.  Lore, now in public beta, is a platform and protocol that makes it easier for Web3 creator communities and game guilds to co-own non-fungible tokens (NFT), opening up new ownership and utility options. Co-owner collectives can pool resources, issue ownership stakes to members, and distribute funds with automated administration settings. Collectives can easily access mints, stake assets or play NFT-based games. Lore also serves as a social network of sorts, making it easier for new members to connect with collectives.  ""The internet bundled us into communities based on shared interests and goals, but collaboration largely stopped there,"" said Lore co-founder and CEO Thomas Scaria in a press release draft shared with CoinDesk. ""Lore gives communities of all sizes a new way to take action, and to ultimately achieve the goals that bind them together,"" he continued. ""Lore turns niche communities into hubs for cultural curation, wealth creation, and commerce. As more opportunities emerge in virtual worlds, Lore will be there to help strangers and friends from all over the world to pool resources to seize opportunities.""  Lore emerged from stealth last summer and previously required NFT ownership to join the platform. The public beta has now opened up the experience to any interested user. Web3 communities already using the platform include Proof, Friends With Benefits, Seed Club, Memeland and Azuki.  The round comes as investments in crypto startups gradually gain steam after nearly stalling due to the crypto bear market and a number of headline-grabbing scandals.  Other investors in the round included Seed Club Ventures, North Island Ventures, Balaji Srinivasan, Zeneca, Mischief Ventures, Sfermion, CMT Digital, Patricio Worthalter, Spice Capital and Sublime Venture, among others. Lore has now raised $7.15 million to date.  Read more: What Is Web3?

BNB Falls 10% From March 2023 High After rising nearly 60% from December to March 2023, reaching as high as $345, BNB is down roughly 10% in the last trading day. Binance, which is one of the popular cryptocurrency exchanges, is under pressure from regulators with agencies, mainly from the United States, questioning the ramp’s compliance with local laws. The effect on the crypto market has been visible but particularly pronounced on BNB, that’s currently lower and trailing other crypto assets, including Ethereum and Dogecoin. Related Reading: Over $18 Billion USDT Held In Binance, Bull Run Incoming? CoinMarketCap data indicates that BNB is the third most valuable cryptocurrency when USDT, a stablecoin, is excluded. BNB has a market capitalization of $49.1 billion and is perched at 4th overall. Despite regulatory headwinds, BNB is still above XRP, the currency behind the XRP Ledger (XRPL); and ADA, the native coin of Cardano, a smart contracts network. However, BNB trails Ethereum, which has a market cap of $224 billion at spot rates, when writing on April 6. Regulators Are Questioning Binance On March 27, the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) officially sued Binance US, three related entities, and two of the exchange’s executives, including Changpeng Zhao, its CEO, for violating the country’s trading laws. There could be causation between how BNB prices react and the exchange acting as a target for regulators. The CFTC says Binance is not fully compliant with applicable derivatives regulations and has failed to keep Americans from using the exchange. Moreover, the regulator cited private messages which appeared to show that Zhao and other executives knew that criminal groups use their exchange.

BNB has immediate support at about $300, a psychological reaction line. Even so, the coin remains within a bullish formation defined by the expansion of prices from mid-March 2023. Based on the BNB candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, the uptrend may resume if prices rally above $350. Besides the CFTC, other regulators are taking action against the exchange. On April 6, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) canceled Binance Australia Derivatives’ license at the exchange’s request. The exchange has been ordered to close all its client’s open derivatives positions by April 21. This comes less than a week after the Australian regulator considered whether they should cancel or suspend Binance’s license. Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) also requested additional information from entities applying for crypto licenses. VARA wants Binance to submit, among other details, ownership structure, and audit procedures.

42414002,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAsxR2,1680793200,Avalanche’s New Subnet to Offer Blockchain Customization for Financial Institutions,"Layer 1 protocol Avalanche (AVAX) is releasing “Evergreen Subnets” – a suite of blockchain deployments, tooling and customization services – for financial institutions.  The firms will be able to launch their own Evergreen subnets for research and development, and for “production-ready use cases,” said Ava Labs, the builders behind the Avalanche blockchain, in a press release.  A subnet is a sovereign network that defines its own rules for membership and tokenomics. They are composed of a group of validators – in this case, Avalanche validators – that work together to reach consensus on the state of one or more blockchains.  “Institutions can pursue their blockchain strategies in private, permissioned chains with known and approved counterparties, while retaining the ability to communicate with other subnets through Avalanche’s native communication protocol Avalanche Warp Messaging (AWM),” according to the statement. The AWM allows users to data transfer, communicate and asset swap without relying on a third party intermediary, the statement added.  Avalanche currently has several Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based subnets, including the Intain Subnet, which is a tokenized asset-backed security (ABS) application and the Deloitte Subnet, which is a platform for efficient Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) fund disbursements.

To enable withdrawals on the Ethereum blockchain, Lido needs to properly prepare the launch of its V2 test network and complete several security audits of its V2 upgrade.  While Shapella, a software upgrade that will enable ether withdrawals, is set to occur on April 12, the preparation of Lido’s V2 testnet and completion of its multiple security audits won't be ready by Shapella. LidoDAO community members had previously voted for the software overhaul in early March.  Lido’s V2 upgrade is “significant in scope” and the “biggest upgrade” for Lido on Ethereum, where more than 5.9 million ETH have been staked. The V2 upgrade will enable ETH withdrawals on the liquid-staking platform.  Lido is the largest decentralized-finance protocol with $11.2 billion in total value locked, according to crypto stats website DefiLlama. The price of LDO, Lido’s governance token, was down 6% in the past 24 hours $2.50, according to CoinGecko.  When talking about the complexity of staking withdrawals for Lido on Ethereum, Kadmil cited a cybernetic principle and said, “The system we are building on top of something should be at least as rich and robust as something we are building upon.”",NEUTRAL,ETH | LDO,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | LDO,Sage D.

Banks: Here's Where The Price Goes Next,"Summary The recent decoupling of Bitcoin from equities, we believe, is the start of a new uptrend that appears to be inversely correlated to the financial sector. As more and more investors realize their deposits, once again, may not be safe, we should see an increase in Bitcoin’s demand. As of recently, 68.09% of the supply in Bitcoin hasn't moved in more than a year, which is encouraging. On Dec. 9, we announced that we are buying Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and laid out the reasons why in an article that was quite clearly named: “ Bitcoin is Going to Rally Again: Here’s What You Need to Know .” Since stating that in that article that Bitcoin was at a meaningful low , Bitcoin is up ~62%. Here's what I said: “Though we are in the 4th bear cycle in Bitcoin's history, the prior 3 cycles suggest where we are is a rare buying opportunity. There is ample evidence to support the $15,500 level is either a major low or very close to a major low. Both the technical and on-chain analysis support this.” We then followed up that article on Jan. 9, stating that Bitcoin is likely in the early stages of a cyclical uptrend , and that we are continuing to buy at current prices. Since then, the price is up ~40%. Not only is the on-chain analysis lining up with our technical analysis, but the fundamental story behind Bitcoin’s intended purpose is starting to manifest. Most forget that Bitcoin’s white paper was first introduced on the heels of a banking crisis that nearly brought down the global financial system. The intended purpose of Bitcoin was to be a hedge against failing banks, as stated by its creator in 2009 . “The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.” The recent decoupling of Bitcoin from equities, we believe, is the start of a new uptrend that appears to be inversely correlated to the financial sector. The financial media would have us believe that the current banking crisis is mostly US centric and localized to regional banks. However, as we look at various charts from these banks, a different story emerges. This is not just a US problem, and it is not limited to regional banks. As more and more investors realize their deposits, once again, may not be safe, we should see an increase in Bitcoin’s demand, which is supported by the on-chain and technical analysis provided below. Bitcoin and Banks On Friday, March 10th, Silicon Valley Bank (SIVBQ) failed. With over $200 Billion in deposits, SIVB was one of the largest banks in the US, and therefore one of the largest bank failures in US history. This was quickly followed by the failure of Signature Bank in New York, with deposits of over $110 billion. What followed was a mini panic out of regional bank stocks, as we soon saw depositors fleeing the more vulnerable regional banks and into the Too Big to Fail banks. Interestingly, on March 10, Bitcoin bottomed and began one of the sharpest jumps we’ve seen since 2021. Tech Insider Network This may seem like a random occurrence, yet this move lines up with Bitcoin’s original white paper , first published on the heels of the Great Financial Crisis by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto. The original intent of Bitcoin was to create a true peer-to-peer electronic payment network that did not rely on centralized institutions to facilitate transactions. In short, it was the first real attempt to disrupt the banking system and remove the inherent risks in a centralized banking system. Coincidentally, this white paper was released in February 2009, which was at the height of despair from the global banking system melting down. Most people assumed their money was safe in a bank and that it would be there when they need it. Most people had no idea about fractional banking, let alone credit default swaps and collaterized debt obligations. What they did realize on a primal level in 2008 was that their money was at the mercy of a centralized system that was much more complex than they thought and not as safe as they previously believed. What we're seeing today is a repeat of the same realization, only with different details. The popular narrative regarding the current banking crisis is that deposits are fleeing regional banks at a record pace and moving into the “Too Big to Fail” banks, like JPMorgan (JPM), Citigroup (C), and Bank of America (BAC). Therefore, any additional weakness in banks should be localized to regional banks while the big banks continue to thrive, which should offset the current weakness. This sounds plausible, and fits within the relative calm we’ve had since the Fed has fenced off the problem banks. However, if we look at the big banks that should be receiving this tailwind of deposits, another picture emerges. Bank of America is one of the largest and most important banks in the US. After the epic consolidation from the GFC in 2008, it was deemed, along with a handful of other banks to be Too Big to Fail, and it remains so today. Just a simple glance at the price chart and we can see that BAC is comfortably below its October low with no buyers stepping in at a critical support level. Tech Insider Network BAC is threatening to break a trendline that has kept the stock trending up since 2012. What's also concerning is that BAC has completed a large degree 5 wave uptrend off the 2009 low. Furthermore, the corrective pattern that began in late 2021 is incomplete and suggesting a test of the COVID lows is needed before some kind of meaningful low can be found. The failure to find buyers at such important support is alarming. Another “Too Big to Fail” Bank is Citigroup. This chart is significantly weak, and has basically trended sideways since the 2009 low. Tech Insider Network Like BAC, it has completed 5 waves up off the 2009 low. However, it topped in 2019, failing to make a new high during the COVID bull market. Also, like BAC, it appears to be pointing towards the COVID low to complete a large degree correction. Another Bank deemed “Too Big to Fail” is Morgan Stanley. It's also in a precarious position. Tech Insider Network Though it's relatively stronger than BAC and C, it also has completed a large 5 wave uptrend off the 2009 low. The following correction, like most bank stocks, has not completed its corrective pattern and looks to be targeting a price below the October low of 2022. These large banks have quite unhealthy and concerning charts. They suggest that what is going on in the banking sector may not be a tailwind for them, but in fact, a headwind that will offset any increase in deposits. What’s more concerning is that the banking issues do not seem to be localized to just the banks. The below chart is MetLife ( MET ), one of the largest insurance providers in the US. Tech Insider Network This is one of the weakest charts in the mega cap financial spaces, as the stock cannot catch a bid at major support. The corrective pattern looks to be a 5 wave move down that is incomplete. If accurate, it suggests that MET has put in a major top. Capital One is another big financial stock that looks like it's in trouble. As a credit card and banking company, its chart looks to be heading much lower, as it attempts to find buyers at a key support level. Tech Insider Network Furthermore, the issue is obviously not localized to the US, proven by the collapse of Credit Suisse. However, if we look at various charts from global banks, a similar pattern emerges. The Royal Bank of Canada (RY) looks a lot like some of the bigger banks in the US. After completing a large 5 wave uptrend into the late 2021 high, we have an incomplete corrective pattern that should take us well below the October 2022 low. Tech Insider Network A few additional bullets on the global banks: Deutsche Bank announced that they will redeem $1.5 billion of notes due in 2028. As a result, the cost of their credit default swaps increased sharply, much like we saw with Credit Suisse prior to their collapse. European banks have been down across the board on this news, as Deutsche Bank saw a 14% drop that day, and is down ~25% from its February high. The French CAC has been one of the stronger indexes in Europe; however, under the hood, the banking sector is the weakest sector, much like in the US. BNP Paribas, Frances largest bank, for example, is down ~18% from its March high. Now, UBS is being probed and possibly sanctioned due to their support of Russian Oligarchs. Two of Japan’s largest banks, Mitsubishi UFC Sumitomo and Mitsui Financial, are down between 14% - 17% from March 9. The largest bank in Australia, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, is down ~13% since March 14, while England’s largest bank, HSBC, is down ~14% since late February. Itaú Unibanco, Brasil’s top bank, is down ~15% since late February and over 25% since last November. The point is that whatever is unfolding in the banking sector is not localized to US regional banks, and is certainly a global concern. The more uncertainty in the centralized banking system, the more that Bitcoin will fulfill its true purpose. In our last article , we discussed that inflation pressures are still quite high, especially within the service sector. Evidence is building that crude and gasoline are looking to breakout to higher levels, which was confirmed with OPEC announcing surprise production cuts this week. While the market is pricing in a Fed pivot, we're getting mixed messages from the prior hawkish FOMC statement and a dovish speech that followed from the Fed chair. If energy does break out, as we believe it will, we could see an unexpected inflation impulse at the worst time. With a global debt-to-GDP sitting at 338% , and an on-going global campaign to aggressively fight stubborn inflationary pressures, it’s no wonder that we are seeing cracks within the system. If what the charts are suggesting does unfold, once again, most people will be confronted with the harsh reality their deposits are possibly not safe, which will only bolster the underlying purpose of Bitcoin. Not only is it a hedge against inflation, but it’s a simple and efficient means to store wealth, which can provide an alternative to gold. Bullish Until Analyzing price action is especially important in Bitcoin. It does not have earnings reports, and rarely has news events to move price. So, the majority of swings that we see in this asset happens based on sentiment. Because of this, it lends itself well to technical analysis, which our firm utilizes in our active management style. The big picture has Bitcoin starting its final 5th wave of a large degree uptrend that started in late 2018. Tech Insider Network This will remain my thesis as long as any weakness holds above $19,550. We’ll now zoom in on the current uptrend, which is the boxed off region on the chart above. Tech Insider Network What you can clearly see is a completed 5 wave pattern off of Bitcoin’s low. This is usually bullish. As long as $19,550 holds, any breakout above the current consolidation would be considered a buy from our analysis. On-Chain Analysis Our risk management partners, WealthUmbrella, are a team of AI and Machine Learning engineers and professors who have spent months analyzing all of the on-chain metrics in Bitcoin. The net result of their research led to a rather advanced risk-on/risk-off signal available to retail investors. The below analysis is provided by the founder and lead engineer, Vincent Duchaine. We previously mentioned that many of our on-chain indicators suggested that the November 2022 low might be the cyclical bottom. Since then, the price surge in Bitcoin has confirmed this low, as we have now moved into what we call the “green environment.” This environment has historically been where we see the start of a new cyclical uptrend. In such an environment, it's generally better, from our research, to stay in the market. However, just because we believe that the bear market is likely over, doesn't mean we're ready for a moonshot. Historically, once we initially move into our green environment, what follows has typically been quite uneventful. We tend to see price action trade sideways-to-up for many months with relatively low volatility. This doesn't mean that, given the context, we couldn't see another black swan event interrupt the green environment. We saw this when COVID suddenly pushed us back into our “red environment” in 2020. This was an unusual event that is accounted for in probabilities, which are historically low. That being said, now that we have a nearly 90% increase from the November low, we must conclude that this appears to be more than just a bear market bounce. In fact, many of our on-chain metrics (InvestorCap, RealizedCap, ThermoCap) are now out of their bottoming zone. This is telling us that the overall ecosystem's economic has recovered significantly. What Our On-Chain Metrics Are Signaling There's a popular saying in finance - “when there is no one left to sell, there is only direction the asset can go.” Interestingly, this saying can be quantified through analysis of on-chain metrics and patterns. One way to monitor this is by looking at the number of newly created BTC addresses . After the 2018 bear market, large upward moves in price were accompanied with a sharp increase of first time buyers in Bitcoin. The below chart measures newly created Bitcoin addresses with a starting balance of $0 (in blue) compared to Bitcoin’s price (in orange). After a small dip in price in late 2021, we returned almost to the local high, but this time the number of new addresses decreased significantly. The same pattern occurred with the 2020 cyclical top, which saw a progressive loss of interest from newcomers. However, this is currently not the case, as we continue to see an upward trend in this metric in sync with the price action. WealthUmbrella This increase in interest with Bitcoin is being accompanied with the largest spike in net positive posts about Bitcoin. Our Bitcoin Twitter Sentiment indicator recently clocked all-time record of 46,000 net positive Twitter posts about Bitcoin on March 16, which was around the time the banking crisis in the US was at its peak. WealthUmbrella Another interesting pattern can be found by analyzing the daily cost in US dollars to complete a Bitcoin transaction . Usually, as the price of Bitcoin rises, the cost to complete that transaction rises as well. Near a top, these fees often diverge and trend downward while the price continues higher. This is caused by fewer transactions being processed on the network. The current setup regarding this metric is supporting the bullish narrative, as both the price and this metric are trending in the same upward direction. WealthUmbrella One of our personal metrics that we created to help us identify normal overbought/oversold conditions vs. cyclical tops/bottoms is called the Metcalfe Law premium/discount metric . This indicator is telling us that Bitcoin is currently priced just slightly above its fair value, and that it has ample room to run before we should get concerned. WealthUmbrella Another interesting phenomenon going on right now is that as price has been pushing up, we consistently made new all-time highs in the percentage of supply that hasn't moved in more than a year . This is encouraging because it not only signals a reduction in Bitcoin’s supply, but follows the same pattern we have seen throughout history during each significant price increase in Bitcoin. When Bitcoin starts to rise, this number tends to rise with price, further decreasing supply. As of recently, 68.09% of the supply in Bitcoin hasn't moved in more than a year, which is encouraging. Also worth noting, the supply that hasn’t moved in over a year came down to 67.17% on Thursday, March 30, 2023, due to a whale dumping around 20,000 bitcoins. WealthUmbrella Our analysis confirmed that this was sold for a significant loss. There's something strangely bullish about a whale dumping a large amount of Bitcoin at a loss, and the market barely dipping, then recovering within a day. Similar significant dumps have previously resulted in massive downward moves that continued for weeks. Conclusion: According to Bitcoin’s creator, the asset’s true purpose is to solve the inherent risks within a centralized banking system. We have had no reason to truly question the need for this thesis in 13 years. However, recent bank failure, coupled with concerning financial charts around the world, could be confirming the potential realization of this original thesis. We believe that if this banking crisis spirals, it will be the catalyst for Bitcoin to push higher. Interestingly, this narrative is being supported with on-chain analysis and technical analysis pointing in the same direction. As long as WealthUmbrella’s signal stays in the “green environment” and price holds above $19,550, we will continue adding carefully to our Bitcoin position with real-time trade alerts sent to our research premium members. What's next My team’s track record on Bitcoin dates back to when we first launched our service in 2019. We’ve held Bitcoin at high allocations with the confidence that we will know when it’s time to add or time to trim substantially . Twitter This helped us announce an audited cumulative return of +47% through 2022 when most all-tech portfolios were negative during the same time period. Not only did we identify a strong buy signal in Bitcoin in December, but we also identified Nvidia's (NVDA) bottom in October . Bitcoin is a leading asset YTD in the market, and Nvidia is the leading stock in the S&P 500. We take gains often and we discuss this in our weekly webinars and on our premium site, one of which is scheduled for next Thursday, April 13.

Gold: Which Is The Better Buy?,"Summary Recently, both Bitcoin and gold have been on the rise, with many market participants likely seeing both as good places to park their money during uncertain times. Digging deeper, it's likely that Bitcoin is rising because of a more speculation-friendly market that is perceived to be around the corner. Gold's rise has been driven by central bank purchases as opposed to an investor-driven flight to safety. Long term, Bitcoin looks drastically overvalued, but gold is also likely to fall eventually. In all, gold is the better play for investors, though I always prefer going long stocks. Bitcoin Vs. Gold One thing that I believe every investor will agree on is that the economy is plagued by uncertainty at this moment. Rising interest rates aimed at combating inflation, fears of a banking crisis turning into something systemically damaging, rising oil prices because of a surprise cut made by OPEC+, and recent jobs data that came in weak, all point to significant volatility in the days, weeks, and months ahead. Recently, the price of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has risen significantly, and many investors are likely interpreting this as a flight to safety. This point is further bolstered by a rise in gold prices, with gold historically acting as a meaningful hedge against inflation and other economic pain. However, I view this picture a bit differently. While I definitely acknowledge that there is a great deal of uncertainty in the market right now, I believe that the drivers behind the rise in Bitcoin and the rise in gold are both very different. At the end of the day, I maintain that Bitcoin is a speculative faux security with no fundamental value behind it, with prices rising in response to a reduction in worries over what the future holds. While it is true that gold is great in an inflationary environment and has risen in part because of concerns over inflation, my belief there is that the recent upside can be attributed to shifting demand in the market for the precious metal. Bitcoin's rise By any measure, 2023 is proving to be a great year for Bitcoin and those who hold it. As of this writing, it has risen by 69.4% compared to what it ended at in December of last year. That significantly outpaces the broader market, gold, and pretty much anything else. Because of its limited supply and belief by speculators that it is similar in nature to gold in that it acts as a store of value, it can be tempting to think that the ascent can be attributed to market participants believing that the future will be worse than the recent past has been. Those relying on this argument can make the case, rather convincingly, by pointing out that the price of Bitcoin has risen by 29.9% since March 9th of this year. For context, March 10th was the day that Silicon Valley Bank, which was owned by SVB Financial Group ( SIVBQ ), more or less collapsed. Data by YCharts The argument here is that, as fears regarding a banking crisis spread, and the risk of further contagion grows, investors would move to safer assets in order to mitigate potential losses should things get really bad. Using the SPDR Gold Shares ( GLD ) ETF as a proxy for gold, upside for the commodity since then was also significant, coming in at 10.4%. In fact, this move higher has pushed gold very near to its all-time high price that was reported in 2020 during the worst days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Seeing both of these increases might be all the evidence that market participants need in order to conclude that, as has been speculated in the past, Bitcoin makes for a suitable store of value during uncertain times. Data by YCharts The picture I see, however, is quite different. Although we did see some spread of the contagion, it's clear by now that regulators have the banking crisis matter under control. With the promise to fund uninsured deposits at the institutions that have failed, and active oversight that has led to other financial institutions absorbing the assets of the most troubled firms, it seems to me as though we are nearing the end of the crisis in question. So what, then, has been the cause of the surge in Bitcoin? Fundamentally speaking, I believe there is no value in Bitcoin beyond the small amount of benefit that comes from instantly being able to transfer value from point A to point B. But that amount, I would argue, in no way justifies prices even remotely close to where they are today. This is something that I argued in an article in November of last year. Although Bitcoin prices have risen significantly since then, I did say that there is no telling how high or low it will trade before the market eventually realizes its worthlessness. That is the nature of a speculative bubble. And a speculative bubble is exactly what seems to be inflating today. When interest rates began rising, it became riskier to allocate capital in certain ways. As I highlighted in another article not too long ago, venture capital and other early-stage capital all but dried up over the past year or so. Interest rates make borrowing more costly, and they make speculative endeavors more dangerous. Once the banking crisis began and regulators stepped in, it became quite clear that the narrative regarding interest rates would change. Since then, we have seen one additional rate hike of 0.25%. However, it seems very likely that we will see, at most, only one further hike this year. And by next year, if not sooner, rates should begin to fall. Prior to all of this occurring, there were worries that interest rates would need to continue to rise, which also would have increased the probability of a hard landing instead of a soft one for the economy. Given the speculative nature of Bitcoin, the idea that interest rates might peak lower than previously anticipated, and may ultimately start to decrease sooner rather than later, would absolutely fuel the bullish nature that Bitcoin holders inherently have. I believe my argument here is further supported by the fact that, since that March 9th date, the market, as measured by the S&P 500, is up 4.1%. With interest rates looking more dovish because of what has happened with the economy, all assets should experience an upside. If the move higher in Bitcoin was instead a flight to safety response, you would expect the broader market to experience a pullback. That clearly has not happened. So what about gold? Those who disagree with me will point out that gold prices have been on the rise as well. I already mentioned this earlier in the article. The only main reason you would expect this to happen is if you were anticipating further pain ahead, particularly pain related to additional inflation. The prospect that lower interest rates might lie ahead would also lend to the idea that inflationary pressures should be easing. And if that is the case, you would expect gold to fall. Gold.org When you dig deeper into the gold data that is available, you start to get a different picture entirely. According to one source , using data from 2022, the largest single use for gold is not an investment. Instead, it's for jewelry. During 2022, a massive 2,086.2 tonnes of gold was used in the jewelry sector. That works out to roughly 45% of all gold consumption for that year. Technology accounted for another 308.5 tonnes, or 6.7%. By comparison, investment comprised only 1,106.8 tonnes, working out to 23.9% of overall demand. For both jewelry and technology, these levels were below what was seen in 2021. Meanwhile, the amount of gold purchased for investment rose about 10.5%. But overall gold consumption as a whole shot up roughly 18% year over year. This move higher was driven by a more than doubling in the amount of gold purchased by central banks and other institutions. The figure shot up 152.3% from 450.1 tonnes to 1,135.7 tonnes. This worked out to roughly $70 billion worth of purchases, and it marked the fastest pace of gold purchases made by central banks since 1967. When you break out the data by country, you see that the single largest purchaser was Turkiye, with 148 tonnes of the product acquired. This was followed by a distant second place for China at 62 tonnes. Although one could argue that these purchases are a flight to safety, the purchases are inherently different from the broader market's purchases. World Economic Forum For instance, Turkiye bought so much of the precious metal because it dealt with double-digit inflation. As of October of last year, the nation was experiencing inflation of 86% compared to what it had seen the same time one year earlier. The purchases made by China, meanwhile, were likely attributable to growing geopolitical tensions between it and the US. There have also been allegations that both China and Russia are buying gold and not reporting it, with the goal of reducing the influence of the dollar on global trade. There is no reliable data that I can find that indicates purchase trends since the end of last year. But gold prices are up 22.4% since November 1st of last year, indicating that buying was probably strong heading into 2023. Takeaway Fundamentally, I do not have any hope for anything positive coming out of Bitcoin. It is significantly overvalued at this moment and has likely risen in response to the idea that the economic environment moving forward will be more accommodating to speculative activities. Because of this, I am incredibly bearish on it. Though I also acknowledge that prices could move significantly in either direction in the near term. Gold, meanwhile, is a little different. Strong demand from central banks as opposed to a flight to safety from investors has likely been the driver behind its increase in price in recent months. Those who disagree with me may point out that this is a flight of safety of its own. But because of the nature of central banks, it is a very different kind of flight than what investors would participate in. If I am correct and if the interest rate environment does become more dovish, and assuming the central bank purchases eventually stabilize instead of increase, I would imagine that gold would fall from here. Though if having to pick between it and Bitcoin, I do think the longer-term prospect that investors would be wise to keep in mind is gold. Even with this being the case, I prefer to have my money parked in stocks since my long-term goal is to beat inflation, not match it.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4592644-bitcoin-vs-gold-which-is-better-buy?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/11483356.jpeg

11483131,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=525873,1680789623,Can Dogecoin Rally Further? Here’s What On-Chain-Data Says,"The Dogecoin (DOGE) price experienced a whopping rally of over 35% at the beginning of the week after Twitter CEO Elon Musk replaced the Twitter logo with the Dogecoin mascot, a Shiba Inu. Initially without comment, the image changed until Musk spoke up. Musk shared a cartoon drawing of the Dogecoin dog sitting in a car with his driver’s license being checked by a police officer. In the ID document, the Twitter logo can be seen in the place of the image, with the dog saying, “That’s an old photo.” pic.twitter.com/wmN5WxUhfQ — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 3, 2023 In his usual manner, Musk has thus once again triggered a massive DOGE pump. But now the question is whether the price increase is sustainable and currently only consolidates or whether DOGE will drop back to its price level before Musk’s action. Can Dogecoin Continue To Rise? On-chain analytics service Santiment released an analysis today in which they examine the sudden Dogecoin pump and the implications of it. Brian Quinlivan, Director of Marketing at Santiment, writes in his analysis that crypto Twitter has predictably reacted to the action with “polarizing” opinions. “Most know by now that when Elon does something on Twitter, it’s usually for the purpose of getting laughs, attention, or money. Perhaps in this case, all three were achieved,” Quinlivan states. Related Reading: Dogecoin Dominates Top 10 Crypto Roster With 20% Rally In Last 7 Days Santiment’s data shows that discussion rates for Dogecoin “absolutely exploded.” However, the price spike ended almost immediately thereafter, followed by a second spike as the volume cooled over the inorganic spike. Quinlivan adds: But like any asset, no matter how meme-ified, we can still take things away from this and analyze what exactly is going on now that prices have calmed down a bit and $DOGE has corrected back -9% from its shocking surge. According to the Santiment analyst, there were numerous top signals that indicated exactly when key players exited the trade or at least took large profits. Quinlivan also speculates that these players “probably knew about the planned DOGE pump.” Active addresses and circulating volume, trading volume and transaction volume, as well as whale transactions (over $100,000) all increased rapidly, decoupling from the rest of the crypto market. According to the analyst, this was a “pretty solid bet” that the price formed a local top at $0.1047. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Prediction: Doge Rally Faded But Not Likely Over On the other hand, the 30-day Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) suggests that DOGE could have further upside potential. The value is currently at +11%, which means there is room to the upside: Typically when altcoins hit +20% or more, this is a “danger zone”. Considering it didn’t quite get that high, even with the massive Elon-induced price surge, there could still be some extra cushion for prices to rise further. Whales Take Profits However, an analysis of DOGE addresses, divided by size into fish (0-10 DOGE), dolphins (10-10,000 DOGE), sharks (10,000-10 million DOGE) and whales (10 million or more DOGE) must be considered rather bearish. While the smallest fish addresses bought aggressively when the price peaked, dolphins and sharks showed no signs of getting involved in the rally at the local top. Instead, their downward trend of the past six weeks continued. Whales were showing signs of accumulation before Musk’s action. However, interest plummeted when the DOGE logo appeared on Twitter and the price hit its top. Quinlivan remarks: It was likely something was known by massive DOGE holders, eg. people close to him, and of course Elon himself. This is just speculation, of course, without knowing the identities of the owners of these addresses. At press time, the Dogecoin price stood at $0.08910. A daily close above $0.08891 could be of significant importance to reignite the upside potential mentioned by Santiment.

42414010,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAsy2B,1680789600,"U.S. Treasury Warns DeFi Is Used by North Korea, Scammers to Launder Dirty Money","Decentralized finance (DeFi) services that aren’t compliant with anti-money laundering and terrorist financing rules pose “the most significant current illicit finance risk” in that corner of the crypto sector, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s first analysis of hazards from the technology.  In an expected risk assessment, published Thursday, the Treasury Department said thieves, scammers, ransomware cyber criminals and actors for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) are using DeFi to launder proceeds from crime.  On the basis of its findings, the department recommends an assessment of “possible enhancements” to U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) requirements and the rules for countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) as they should be applied to DeFi services. It also calls for input from the private sector to inform the next steps.  “Clearly, we can't do this alone,” said Brian Nelson, Treasury’s undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, in a Thursday webcast hosted by ACAMS, a global organization focused on preventing financial crime. “We call on the private sector to use the findings of the risk assessment to inform your own risk-mitigation strategies.”  The 40-page report warns that “DeFi services at present often do not implement AML/CFT controls or other processes to identify customers, allowing layering of proceeds to take place instantaneously and pseudonymously.”  Read more: Money Laundering Picks Up Steam on DeFi Protocols: Chainalysis  The report references several instances where DeFi projects “have affirmatively touted a lack of AML/CFT controls as one of the primary goals of decentralization.” A footnote in the document cites ShapeShift’s 2021 transformation to a decentralized exchange “for the purpose of ceasing to collect customer information for AML/CFT compliance.”  “When these entities fail to register with the appropriate regulator, fail to establish and maintain sufficient AML/CFT controls or do not comply with sanctions obligations, criminals are more likely to exploit their services successfully, including to circumvent U.S. and [United Nations] sanctions,” the report said.  Although the goal of the assessment is to “identify the scope of an issue,” the report recommends the U.S. government strengthen its AML/CFT regulatory supervision and consider providing additional guidance for the private sector on compliance checks for DeFi services.  The assessment furthers the work outlined in President Joe Biden’s executive order on crypto from last year, and Nelson said it's the first of its kind in the world. Other jurisdictions including the European Union have also started looking at tackling money laundering risks associated with DeFi.  Nelson noted that DeFi can often pose challenges in trying to figure out the individuals behind the business activities. But he pointed out it doesn't matter whether the services are centralized or decentralized when figuring out whether they're covered by the Bank Secrecy Act.  He said even those that claim full decentralization can really engage in a wide range of activity that falls somewhere closer to traditional finance than they're suggesting.  “In some ways they're really decentralized in name only,” he said.

The market value of the stablecoin continues to rise and is now within a whisker of its record high.  CoinGecko data show tether's market capitalization has increased by over 20% to $80 billion this year – with the valuation surging by 12% in the past four weeks alone.  The rise means tether's market cap is now just $3 billion short of the record high of $83 billion reached in May of last year.  Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto services provider Matrixport, said tether's valuation had been driven higher by ""aggressive minting and issuance"" on the Tron Network, which has a greater presence in mainland China compared to Ethereum and a greater focus on the movement on money.  Per data tracked by Matrixport, tether issued on Tron accounts for more than half of the stablecoin's current market value.  While tether's market capitalization has surged alongside bitcoin's (BTC) price rally, the market capitalization of Circle's USDC stablecoin, the world's second-largest dollar-pegged coin, has dropped by 27% to $32.5 billion. Investors began fleeing USDC last month after Circle revealed holding $3.3 billion with failed Silicon Valley Bank (SVB).  The market value of Paxos' centralized, dollar-pegged stablecoin BUSD has also declined by 58% to $7 billion this year. In February, the New York Department of Financial Services ordered Paxos Trust Company to cease minting BUSD. Paxos, in response, stopped minting new tokens while promising to process redemptions till February 2024.  According to Matrixport, some USDC holders likely diversified into tether and bitcoin.  ""When news about unlimited support for bank deposits made the rounds, bitcoin prices exploded from $20,000 to $28,000 within a matter of days,"" said Thielen in a note to clients on Thursday.

In Q1, the crypto exchange's transaction volumes were about flat Q/Q at $145B, the note said, falling short of the Wall Street estimate of $169B. Coinbase ( COIN ) is expected to publish Q1 results on May 9. COIN app downloads of 2.7M also slumped 6% from Q4, data from Sensor Tower showed, marking the lowest quarterly mark since Q3 2020.

The European Union’s executive arm is set to issue proposals in the coming months, but it likely won’t include a draft bill, said the call for evidence, which is open until May 3.  “There is a risk of having a small number of big players becoming future gatekeepers of virtual worlds, creating market entry barriers and shutting out EU startups and SMEs [small and medium-sized enterprises] from this emerging market,” said the draft, echoing earlier fears raised by antitrust officials about potential dominance from web giants like Meta Platforms.  The paper sets out a range of policy issues for what it calls Web 4.0, where physical and virtual worlds interact immersively, using connected smart devices. It cites issues including equality, data privacy, cybersecurity and openness, as well as finance for local businesses.  The EU recently passed a Digital Markets Act to rein in supposed anticompetitive behavior by internet giants such as Meta, Google and Amazon, but the bloc is worried similar trends could occur in later iterations of the internet economy.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin is showing signs of weakness ahead of a long Easter weekend in many countries and the release of the U.S. jobs report for March on Friday. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value dropped 2% in the past 24 hours to below $27,800, after reaching as high as $28,800 earlier this week. U.S. stock markets will be closed on Friday for Good Friday. Bitcoin, of course, always trades. It is estimated that U.S. employers added 238,000 jobs in March, with the unemployment rate set to hold steady at 3.6%, according to data from Trading Economics. Traders watch the report for signs of inflation, which affects the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate policy and in turn prices of risky assets like bitcoin. The dollar edged up slightly on Thursday, and the price of gold extended its gains.  The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has cancelled Binance Australia's derivatives license, according to a press release on Thursday. Binance Australia, an arm of the world's largest crypto exchange by trading volume, has been ordered by the regulator to close all of its customers’ open derivatives positions by April 21. ASIC has been reviewing of Binance's businesses, the press release said. Binance found itself in hot water with regulators last week when the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued the exchange for selling unregistered derivatives products in the U.S.  Binance recently turned down an offer to acquire Tron blockchain founder Justin Sun’s ownership stake in rival exchange Huobi, according to a person familiar with the matter. Binance wasn’t interested because of rumors that Huobi has ties to mainland China, which the exchange wants nothing to do with, according to the person, who requested anonymity. In an interview last month with CoinDesk TV, Sun said Huobi wants to attain a license in Hong Kong and start an exchange there called Huobi Hong Kong. The scope of Sun’s involvement with Huobi has been cloaked in secrecy.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the ratio between trading volumes in bitcoin and ether's spot markets since June 2021.  The ratio has recently declined sharply, reaching its lowest point since late 2021.  Historically, such sharp declines have portended bitcoin price pullbacks.

This proposal focuses on the improvement of the Arbitrum ecosystem. Over the past 24 hours, Arbitrum’s native token ARB has plummeted by over 5% after depreciating from its regained losses from the weekend saga as of yesterday. The asset has fallen from a high of $1.28 seen on April 5 to trading at $1.20, at the time of writing. Arbitrum Releases New Governance Proposal On April 5, the Arbitrum Foundation released a proposal for the betterment of the ecosystem methods of governance. This proposal dubbed “Arbitrum Improvement Proposals (AIPs)” was shared on the Ethereum layer-2 solution’s official Twitter page. Related Reading: Arbitrum Whales Dump 3.73 Million Tokens, Impacting Market Prices The proposal included two factors that include AIP-1.1 which targets a smart contract lockup schedule for over 4 years, budget, and transparency, as well as AIP-1.2, which focuses on amendments to current founding documents “lowering the proposal threshold from 5 million to 1 million tokens to make governance more accessible.” Confirming that the Arbitrum DAO has reached a consensus against the first proposal AIP-1.1, the Layer 2 solution provider stated: Rather than asking the DAO to vote on actions that have already been taken, AIP-1.2 proposes to use the DAO’s ability to make changes to those initial parameters to incorporate community feedback. Meanwhile, on April 2, Arbitrum hinted that the AIP-1.1 “likely will not pass” as a result of the community’s resentment against the proposal. Token holders opposed the proposal noting it targets too many things as well as grants $1 billion in ARB to the foundation. Veering back to the community argument, Arbitrum noted in the April 5 tweet: The Foundation will not move any of the remaining 700M tokens in the Administrative Budget Wallet until an acceptable budget and smart contract lockup schedule have been approved by the DAO. ARB Plummets 5% After regaining a few cents yesterday following its bearish trend over the weekend, ARB is currently in the red, down by 5.3% in the last 24 hours. The asset’s price has moved from trading as high as $1.43 late last month to trading nearly below $1.20 at the time of writing following its bearish trend from the beginning of the day. ARB’s market cap has also plummeted, seeing the token fall from ranking at #39 to ranking #41 as of today in terms of market capitalization among other cryptocurrencies in the global crypto market.

Related Reading: These Top 5 Meme Coins Are Bleeding As March 2023 Ends – Here’s Why Source: Coingecko Despite a 1.7% drop in the last 24 hours, DOGE has had the most impressive price performance among the top 10 cryptocurrencies. What lies ahead for Dogecoin now? Dogecoin Dips As Bears Take Control After a period of strong gains, Dogecoin’s momentum appears to be waning. The cryptocurrency has been flashing red on the 1-day timeframe for two consecutive days, signaling the start of a potential downtrend. This could be due to a lack of buyer interest. Adding to the bearish outlook is DOGE’s daily relative strength index (RSI), which has entered its overbought zone, increasing the likelihood of a correction in the near future. This correction could lead to a drop toward the $0.089 level, which served as resistance during the January and February uptrend. Bears are known to take advantage of any easing in buying pressure, and if the bearish momentum continues, the Dogecoin price could plummet toward the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.082. If DOGE breaks below this level, it could reach the support confluence between the horizontal line and the 100-day EMA at $0.080. When $DOGE breaks out above the HTF downtrend here, I think $0.25 is a reasonable target. pic.twitter.com/yxUAeqxGHG — K A L E O (@CryptoKaleo) April 4, 2023 Analyst Predicts Future Gains Independent analyst Crypto Kaleo, meanwhile, sings a more bullish tune. On Twitter, he said that the cryptocurrency is headed for a breakout above a long-standing descending trendline resistance, which could propel its price to reach $0.25 – a substantial 125% increase. This prediction is based on a potential increase in buying pressure, possibly fueled by the ongoing altcoin season narrative. If this happens, the immediate resistance level at $0.097 could be shattered, paving the way for more bullish sentiment. A critical flip of this roadblock into support would also invalidate the bearish thesis, as this level has been a tough hurdle for DOGE investors for several months.

42414008,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAsxLj,1680776720,"India Targeting One Million CBDC Users in Three Months, Prioritizing Offline Transfers: Sources","India's retail central bank digital currency (CBDC-R) architects are aiming to scale the user base of the digital rupee to one million users, and have prioritized solving the challenge of creating an offline version, two people familiar with the matter told CoinDesk.  Although RBI officials publicly stated in March they were aiming for 500,000 users by July, they are privately looking to double that amount.  ""Given India’s population as the world’s largest, we expect to reach the milestone of one million users easily,” one person said, adding that the tentative timeline for reaching one million users is three months.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is running both retail and wholesale CBDC pilots. The retail CBDC pilot is active in at least 15 cities with more than 13 banks participating. India's retail CBDC pilot began on Dec. 1, 2022, and has seen more than 100,000 customers participate in the four months since.  India's digital rupee was the subject of great interest at a recent meeting of the Group of 20 (G-20) hosted by India in Bengaluru, said RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das in a media conference on Thursday. ""In fact, an eminent person from the international financial sector went to the extent of complementing the design of our CBDC, adding that the only thing he missed in the CBDC was the smell of new currency.""  The RBI had initiated a Hackathon in 2023 to find solutions to some of the challenges around a retail CBDC including improving scalability, increasing transactions per second and solutions for enabling offline transactions.  ""This is nearly an impossible trinity. As on date, you can achieve two objectives but not the third,"" said another person. ""Hopefully, some technological innovation will address this soon.""  A digital currency system that can facilitate offline transactions is seen as a way to improve financial inclusion in emerging economies such as India.  The RBI is hoping to conduct offline transactions by testing the use of wearables, cards including debit and credit, Bluetooth technology and a smartphone. Another key concern the RBI is looking to address is the risk of double-spending.  More than 50 proposals were submitted to the RBI on the closing date of March 24 to solve the problem of offline transactions, one person said.  The RBI has also been interacting with private companies to consider solutions to improving scalability, even though no partnership has been initiated with any prominent blockchain-related entities.  The RBI has not announced a timeline for rolling out a full-scale retail CBDC but has previously indicated it was aiming for the end of the year.

42414022,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAsyY1,1680774780,Bitcoin's Tight Correlation With Nasdaq-SPX Ratio Muddies Safe-Haven Narrative,"Bitcoin's (BTC) price rose 23% in March as multiple U.S. banks went bust, bolstering fears that is a recession is coming.  Several analysts have called the move higher a safe-haven rally – with the price gain being attributed to investors seeking shelter in the top cryptocurrency amid bank failures.  Bitcoin, however, rose in tandem with the Nasdaq to S&P 500, or NDX/SPX, ratio, a sign the rally was partly, if not mainly, driven by improved risk appetite stemming from hopes for an early Federal Reserve pivot in favor of liquidity-boosting rate cuts.  The NDX/SPX ratio measures the relative difference in valuation between technology stocks represented in the Nasdaq 100 and a basket of broader industry stocks from the S&P 500.  The ratio rose by 5.65% in March, capping its best monthly performance since February 2009, as banking sector instability saw traders aggressively reinstate bets that the Fed would cut rates later this year. Nasdaq surged nearly 10%, outperforming the S&P 500's 3.5% gain by a big margin.  The 90-day correlation coefficient between bitcoin and the NDX/SPX ratio rose from 0.81 to 0.90, signaling the strongest positive relationship between the two assets since June 2022. At press time, the correlation coefficient stood at 0.89. The positive correlation means on days when the ratio rises, bitcoin is more likely to do the same and vice versa.  ""BTC is still trading like a risk asset,"" Noelle Acheson, the author of the popular Crypto is Macro Now newsletter, said, referring to the positive correlation between bitcoin and the NDX/SPX ratio. ""The rising NDX/SPX ratio means tech is doing better, which says risk sentiment is strong.""  Tech stocks tend to be more sensitive to interest-rate expectations than the broader market. Thus a rising ratio is often equated with dovish Fed expectations and improved investor risk appetite that often percolates into other assets like cryptocurrencies, as observed in 2020 and early 2021. A falling ratio represents a sentiment against risky assets.  ""Much like crypto, growth-style companies, which are expected to provide cash flows, or some form of fundamental value, further out into the future, find their performance more heavily influenced by shifts in interest rates. The Nasdaq 100 index, for example, is comprised of mostly growth-style sectors, such as technology, which are more sensitive to rising or falling rate expectations,"" Gabriel Selby, a research analyst at CF Benchmarks, told CoinDesk in an email.  Selby added that as the NDX/SPX ratio is closely tracking the crypto market, it suggests interest-rate expectations are in the driver's seat and the pricing divergence between equities and crypto markets may not be as wide as initially thought.  The correlation between bitcoin and the NDX/SPX ratio was consistently positive during the 2022 bear market and between May 2020 and March 2021, when the cryptocurrency rallied nearly tenfold to $60,000.  If that's not enough, both have been rallying in lockstep since early January. While bitcoin has risen nearly 70% this year, the ratio is up 11.26%.  Bitcoin's pause at around $28,000 since March 22 is consistent with the consolidation in the NDX/SPX ratio.  While bitcoin's near-term prospects appear tied to gyrations in the NDX/SPX ratio, it could benefit from fears of fiat currency devaluations over time, according to Acheson.  ""BTC is still (and always will be) a risk asset for traditional investors. It is also likely to be regarded as a safe haven,"" Acheson said. ""We are likely to see continued accumulation from longer-term investors interested in its currency debasement hedge properties, while short-term moves are dictated by shifting theories about what monetary liquidity will do.""",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/06/bitcoins-tight-correlation-with-nasdaq-to-sp-500-ratio-muddies-the-safe-haven-narrative,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4c69fd255e5b9dd98c639c9a75a49b862eee60a6-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42414003,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAsxbe,1680774709,Japan Approves Web3 White Paper to Promote Industry Growth in the Country,"Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party's Web3 project team has published a white paper laying out recommendations for boosting the crypto industry in the country, which is part of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's strategy of promoting technology, a project called ""Cool Japan.""  While other governments are looking to put regulation in place to protect consumers, Japan is trying to create a friendlier environment for crypto after firms began leaving for other jurisdictions because of heavy tax burdens.  The Web3 project team has been bypassing the usual bureaucratic processes to formulate regulatory proposals for everything from NFTs to decentralized autonomous organizations.  “The cryptocurrency industry has been driven by early adopters, but it will shift to mass adoption from now on,” Akihisa Shiozaki, secretary-general of the party's Web3 project team, said in an interview with CoinDesk Japan.  Shiozaki pointed out that major companies in Japan have started to enter the market. Japanese mobile phone operator NTT Docomo pledged to invest up to 600 billion yen ($4 billion) into Web3 infrastructure and large financial institutions are looking to issue stablecoins.  The white paper notes that Japan should demonstrate leadership at the Group of Seven summit this year, where crypto will be discussed, and says the country should look ahead to the future potential of Web3 and clarify its leading position on technology-neutral and responsible innovation.  It also proposes further changes to tax regulation, noting that one significant exemption for token issuers has already been approved. Among the proposals is having tax exclusions for companies holding tokens issued by other companies that aren't going to be traded short term. It advises allowing self-assessments so that investors can carry over losses for three years and says crypto should be taxed only when the assets are exchanged for fiat currency.  The document identifies a lack of accounting standards as an urgent issue as Web3 companies have had difficulties finding auditors. It says that ministries and agencies should support the Japanese Institute of Certified Public Accountants in formulating guidelines.  It also advises setting up a DAO law based on Japan's godo kaisha (a type of business similar to a limited liability company) and making changes to regulations under the Companies Act and the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act.  The white paper notes that the screening process for tokens already in circulation is shortening but reviewing new tokens issued by foreign entities remains slow. It advises making procedures more transparent so that issuers can present the information necessary for review.  Japan passed a framework for regulating stablecoins last year. The new white paper stresses the importance of creating a process for stablecoin registration and establishing a self-regulatory organization. It also mentions developing proposals for yen-backed stablecoins.  Large companies in Japan have shown interest in the Web3 industry. The white paper, however, says that approvals for banks and insurance companies entering the industry remain unclear and says the government should lay out guidelines.  On non-fungible tokens, the white paper proposes public-private partnerships to set guidelines on legal business models for fantasy sports services. It also recommends the public and private sectors work together to sort out data and NFT rights, and consider ways for content holders to legally license NFTs.  A Web3 minister should take charge of promoting policies and cooperation with other countries, according to the document. It says that Japan's Digital Agency will set up a related consultation desk for local governments and business operators.  It also proposes the issuance of crypto visas to skilled workers and expanding the startup visa system.

Ethereum Outperforming Bitcoin When writing, Ethereum is also relatively firm against Bitcoin. While liquid and remains the most valuable digital asset, BTC has been consolidating below $29,000. Ethereum is up roughly 1% against BTC in the last trading day. However, from the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, the coin is up approximately 10% versus Bitcoin from March 2023 lows. Related Reading: Ethereum Hits Multi-Month High, But $2,000 Price Point Remains Crucial Looking at the ETHBTC formation, it is evident that ETH buyers are in the driving seat. However, Bitcoin was firmer in the first three months of 2023, adding about 20% against ETH. By the time Q1 2023 ended, Bitcoin had managed to reverse the losses it had posted against ETH in the second half of 2022. From September 2022 to March 2023, BTC gained 30% against ETH, forcing prices back to important reaction points defined in the second half of 2022. Bitcoin Is King But Trails ETH Ahead Of Shanghai There were several factors behind this Ethereum upswing, outpacing Bitcoin. Although Bitcoin and Ethereum are two of the most liquid cryptocurrencies, BTC’s first-mover advantage and regulatory clarity make an option for some institutions. From a regulatory standpoint, Bitcoin also has support from United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Both agencies have clarified that Bitcoin is a commodity. Also, institutions are accumulating BTC. MicroStrategy, whose shares are listed on NASDAQ, is one of the largest BTC holders and continues to accumulate, recently purchasing more coins. MicroStrategy has acquired an additional 1,045 #bitcoin for ~ $29.3M at an average price of $28,016 per bitcoin. As of 4/4/2023 @MicroStrategy holds 140,000 bitcoin acquired for ~$4.17 billion at an average price of $29,803 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/IBufTxalnv — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) April 5, 2023 Meanwhile, Ethereum’s liquidity position makes ETH an option for investors. Even so, considering its position in the market cap leaderboard and continuous upgrades, ETH can draw traders’ and investors’ attention. For this reason, investors are closely monitoring events ahead of the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade in mid-April. It is a crucial network update that will see the platform fully transition as a proof-of-stake blockchain, with stakers freely able to withdraw their coins. Until this upgrade happens, ETH stakers cannot move their coins from the Beacon Chain. When writing on April 6, there was 18,077,351 ETH worth over $34 billion locked.

The total locked value of assets on the platform has risen over 300% since the start of this year, DefiLlama data shows. Of the total, $26 million has been captured on the Ethereum network, $21 million on the Arbitrum network and just under $1 million on Avalanche.  Staked ether (stETH) dominates the holdings, taking up 27% of all capital on Pendle, followed by the GMX protocol’s GLP tokens at 18% and DAI stablecoins at 16%.  Some strategies are offering as much as 82% annualized yields on ether (ETH) and ether derivative tokens. These have a maturity period that ends in late 2023 or early 2024.  Pendle is also letting investors purchase ether at a 5.88% discount as of Thursday. That ether can be claimed on Dec. 26, 2024, when the discount will be made up for by capturing future expected yields on the principle amount.  More sophisticated strategies that use ether derivatives offered by other projects, such as Frax, are offering as much as 441% in yields over a 624-day period.  How Pendle works  Pendle uses a dual-token model that breaks up and represents any investment into a DeFi protocol, such as Compound or Aave, into two parts: one, the initial principle put up by an investor, and two, the future yield expected to be earned on that position in the form of token rewards.  This is done by wrapping yield-bearing tokens into a standardized yield token. That token is then wrapped into a principal token, or PT, and yield token, or YT, which can be traded on the open market.  “Nearly every pool in DeFi gives you a yield-bearing position in return for staking or depositing tokens,” Pendle said in its technical documents. “1 PT gives you the right to redeem 1 unit of the underlying asset upon maturity. 1 YT gives you the right to receive yield on 1 unit of the underlying asset from now until maturity, claimable in real-time.”  This allows Pendle to offer several products to users – such as the ability to lock in expected fixed yields, buy yields in the hopes of higher returns in the future or switch between multiple strategies to continually gain from yields offered by different platforms.  Pendle’s native governance tokens, PENDLE, traded at 50 cents at press time on Thursday. These accrue value over time, documents show, and can ultimately benefit from the growth and adoption of the underlying platform.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING | PENDLE,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/04/06/high-ether-yields-drive-50m-to-defi-protocol-pendle-finance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/37775596a1aaefe587b561f092c0abbb2ce188cb-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

11475998,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=525825,1680770742,"New Bitcoin Price Model Predicts Fair Price Of At Least $379,823","Raphael Zagury, chief investment officer at Swan Bitcoin, has developed a new BTC pricing model that currently calculates a fair price of $387,823 in a base case. Zagury calls it Schrödinger’s Coin Model and bases the valuation of Bitcoin on the fact that it is a store of value that will demonetize all other assets. Bitcoin Price Undervalued By At Least 13 Fold Inspired by “Bitcoin as Property” by Michael Saylor, the model calculates Bitcoin’s potential to siphon off the monetary premium from traditional assets, resulting in a shift in capital allocation and a revaluation of their value. It hypothesizes that the expansion of money supply by central banks around the world has led to a fundamental destruction of money and a flight of capital by investors into financial instruments such as stocks, real estate, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as their primary stores of value. Central banks, flooded with excess currency, have fundamentally broken the value of money, leading investors to seek protection against the negative effects of money printing. This phenomenon has resulted in the financialization of the economy and huge monetary premiums. These premiums have the effect of pricing many of these assets, including real estate, far above their utility value, Zagury argues. Bitcoin, according to the analyst, has the potential to benefit from this and become the premium asset by demonetizing the aforementioned traditional stores of value. Related Reading: This “Super” Bitcoin Technical Tool Says Limited Resistance Remains To calculate Bitcoin’s fair value, the model looks at the major asset classes and uses probabilities for when and how much share Bitcoin can take from each asset class. In addition, a time value is included. Furthermore, the Schrödinger’s Coin model is based on the concept of quantum superposition, where Bitcoin has two possible outcomes. “It either fails and is worthless (Dan Peña scenario) or captures the monetary premium of traditional stores of value (Saylor scenario),” the analyst states. How Is the Base Scenario Calculated? In each scenario, the value of demonetization by Bitcoin is calculated for each asset class based on the parameters and summed up. The base case assumes that 60% of gold’s market capitalization is due to monetization rather than utility. With a market capitalization of $10 trillion and a 70% probability of gold demonetization, this results in a Bitcoin price of $87,000. When the other asset classes are now added and an intertemporal discount rate of 12.5% is considered, this results in a Bitcoin present value of $379,823 in the base case. Underlying the base case are the following parameters of demonetization shown in the image below. In the most bullish scenario, BTC could reach a price of over $3 million per coin. “In terms of expected value, here’s the path to HyperBitcoinization as this scenario plays out; leading to a Bitcoin price of +$3mm in 20 years,” Zagury writes. Related Reading: MicroStrategy Acquires Additional 1,045 Bitcoin The gif below shows the interface that Zagury is currently still developing to allow Bitcoiners to make their own assumptions and probabilities in order to calculate a fair Bitcoin price. Full model description, sources and more info here:https://t.co/qwKsjTV8iz I'm figuring out a way to share the dynamic application below as open source. This way anyone can make their own scenarios and assumptions. Soon… Bitcoiners run the numbers. ▶️ pic.twitter.com/9VVidSH3PZ — Alpha Zeta (@alphaazeta) April 5, 2023 Sam Callahan, lead analyst at Swan commented on the modell: Bitcoin’s adoption won’t happen overnight. It’s a game of probabilities as more people learn about it and begin to value it over time. Eventually, it will demonetize other assets due to its superior monetary properties, but today, it remains underappreciated and thus undervalued. At press time, the BTC price stood at $27,912. After another failed attempt to overcome the resistance area at $28,600, the BTC price is currently struggling to find support.

42393748,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpA0uz,1680763629,"Jump in Shiba Inu Breed-Themed Tokens Is Unsustainable, Crypto Traders Warn","Tokens fashioned after the Shiba Inu dog breed may see imminent selling ahead after days of outperforming the broader crypto market.  On Monday, Twitter, a social-media company owned by billionaire and crypto proponent Elon Musk, replaced its popular blue bird logo with that of Dogecoin’s Shiba Inu mascot. Dogecoin (DOGE) prices surged almost immediately – with its futures markets setting a record – as some bet on the increased use of dogecoin on Twitter's platform.  That rise caused several other Shiba Inu-themed meme coins to jump multifold, with the sector rising 14% on average. Tokens with larger market caps such as shiba inu (SHIB) rose up to 10%, while smaller-cap coins such as floki (FLOKI), kishu inu (KISHU) and baby dogecoin (BABYDOGE) surged as much as 25%.  Meme coins on newer blockchains had their moment, as well. Some dog-themed tokens, such as zkDoge and zkShib on the zkSync blockchain, which went live in March, registered gains of as much as 100%.  Such surges in price are unlikely to hold long term, however, as some traders warn that such moves don't indicate a broader trend.  ""We do not believe that it is indicative of a long-term bull run. Quite the opposite,” Guilhem Chaumont, CEO of crypto trading firm Flowdesk, said in a Telegram message. “There is a regular pattern of crypto market uptrends with first, bitcoin going through a bull run, then major altcoins pumping, and finally, tokens with small market caps.  “Since bitcoin has been experiencing a relatively stable upward trend, meme coins’ rise would indicate the third phase, the end of the cycle. But there is no need to over-interpret such momentary price changes,” Chaumont said.  It is a sentiment shared by Bonnie Cheung, head of strategy at crypto developer Sending Labs. “The sentiment for meme coins is not a new one, and this means there is a high potential that the growth will fade off as usual in a few days,” Cheung said.  There could still be long-term growth for these tokens if fundamental features strengthen in the coming months.  “Shiba Inu, for instance, is gaining additional traction through the launch of Shibarium, its layer-2 protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain. Dogecoin’s recognition by Twitter and the payment world is also growing, and these trends can help record more sustained growth over the long term,” Cheung noted.  A testnet for Shiba Inu’s upcoming Shibarium platform has seen brisk adoption. Elsewhere, projects like Floki are actively developing games and decentralized-finance tools to cut free from the “meme coin” tag – at least as far as developer efforts go.  Meanwhile, some opine that Twitter’s move could pave the way for mainstream crypto adoption.  “Musk’s supportive tweets and the recent decision to add the Dogecoin logo to Twitter help keep both DOGE and SHIB in the public conversation,” Kadan Stadelmann, the chief technology officer of blockchain network Komodo, said in an email to CoinDesk.  “Regardless of whether or not one supports meme coins, it's impossible to deny that Musk is driving mainstream adoption of crypto and creating media attention that wouldn't otherwise exist. This is certainly a net positive for the crypto space as a whole,” Stadelmann added.",NEGATIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BLOCKCHAIN | DOGE | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/06/jump-in-shiba-inu-breed-themed-tokens-is-unsustainable-warn-crypto-traders,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/21a095b852dbccf17a5ea21f54a0c4049d224387-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The project has been ongoing for about six months, the Bloomberg story said. A separate industry report expected to outline best practices in areas like due diligence and risk management, could be published in the next two months, the sources told Bloomberg. The report that focuses on firms that provide payment services would cover stablecoins, non-fungible tokens (NFT) and gaming credits.  “There are no rules prohibiting banks operating in Singapore from doing business with crypto/DPT players. As with any other current or prospective customer, banks are required to conduct customer due diligence measures to understand and manage the risk(s) posed by them,"" a spokesperson for the Monetary Authority of Singapore said.  The MAS told Bloomberg there are no rules stopping banks operating in the country from doing business with firms handling cryptocurrencies or other forms of digital assets. According to the sources cited by Bloomberg, ""even with such guidelines, the banks will decide whether to accept these clients based on their risk appetites.""  In the past few week, U.S. authorities have been cracking down on banks that served crypto customers to cut the cryptocurrency industry off from banking services. The collapse of crypto-friendly banks Signature Bank (SBNY), Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), and Silvergate Bank (SI) has forced crypto companies to scramble to find banking partners and jurisdictions to conduct businesses.

Australia's CBDC pilot, run by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre (DFCRC), began last year to explore use cases for a CBDC. The DFCRC is a 180 million Australian dollar (US$124.3 million) program funded by industry partners, universities and the Australian Government.  ANZ partnered with Grollo Carbon Ventures to trade Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCU), which are issued by the Australian Government’s Clean Energy Regulator.  ANZ and GCV tested real-world ACCUs by first tokenizing existing ACCUs. ANZ's own stablecoin (A$DC) was then used to purchase the tokenized ACCUs. Australia's Pilot CBDC was used as a risk-free asset to support the issuance of A$DC, the announcement said.  Tokenization of carbon markets can reduce settlement time and partnership risk and provide incentives for investment in climate solutions.  The RBA has revealed a set of projects to test use cases for its CBDC. Partners for the pilot projects include Mastercard, Monoova, the Australian Bond Exchange, DigiCash, Commonwealth Bank and others.

The filename is “simpledoc.pdf” and it’s only 184 KB,” writes Baio on Waxy. “Maybe it was just a convenient, lightweight multipage PDF for testing purposes, never meant to be seen by end users.”  There’s also another angle to note. Craig Wright has been attempting to copyright the Bitcoin white paper and has been suing – unsuccessfully – places that host it. This may have been an internal act of defiance by a coder working at Apple, a company too big for Wright to sue.  In February 2023, Wright lost a copyright claim in a U.K Court regarding the white paper.  “I do not see any prospect of the law as currently stated and understood in the case law allowing copyright protection of subject matter which is not expressed or fixed anywhere,” Judge James Mellor said at the time in a ruling for the High Court of England and Wales. “It remains the case that no relevant 'work' has been identified containing content which defines the structure of the Bitcoin File Format.”  It will likely be a mystery as to why this PDF was included, though many will be checking to see if it is in MacOS 14, which is expected to launch later this year.  It will also be interesting to see if Apple takes note of this and removes it via its regular cadence of patches pushed out to MacOS users.

The second-largest cryptocurrency was recently holding steady a few dollars shy of the $1,900 perch it assumed Wednesday, down 1% over the past 24 hours, but up more than 5% from the start of the week when it was lingering below $1,800.  Investors seem increasingly enamored by the Shanghai hard fork, which is slated to occur on April 12. The upgrade, also called Shapella, will mark the completion of Ethereum’s full transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) network and enable staked ETH withdrawals.  ""This hard fork will allow people to withdraw from their validator balance into their Ethereum balance, which is great for increased liquidity across the market and accessibility for those that trade in staked ether,"" Victoria Bills, chief investment strategist at financial services firm Banrion Capital Management, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program. ""And one thing that we can probably expect from that is an increase in activity across the chain when it comes to Ethereum.""  To be sure, some ether observers say the impending unlocking of ETH deposited in the network to boost security in return for rewards will spur a rush of token liquidations. But others maintain that the event could prove bullish for ether because staking and capturing yields directly from the blockchain will become more accessible.  ""This is an amazing opportunity for ether and even has shown for its year-to-date high up,"" Bills said. ""As it continues to become more of liquid and more accessible, we'll probably be seeing a lot more of that asset being traded.""  Bitcoin recently dipped below $28,000, off about 2.2%, after spending much of the day above this threshold as it has for most of the last three weeks. The largest cryptocurrency in market capitalization has held steady as investors ponder multiple signs of economic contraction and potential aftershocks of the recent banking crisis.  Other major cryptos were recently in the red, albeit lightly shaded. Popular meme coin DOGE, a big winner after Twitter replaced its blue bird logo atop its homepage with the crypto's Shiba Inu dog emblem, tumbled more than 4.5%.  Equity markets closed mixed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) ticking up but the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 dropped 1% and 0.2%, respectively.  Banrion's Bills noted that bitcoin's price has steadied as the banking turbulence has subsided. ""Bitcoin had a shoot-up through the roof when we had a lot of turmoil, and then we're seeing it kind of come back to a more steady state around $28K,"" she said.  Insights  The Keys to Becoming a Successful Crypto Liquidity Provider  A new research report that crypto data firm Amberdata shared with CoinDesk says that providing token liquidity to decentralized finance (DeFi) applications could be more lucrative than simply holding those tokens.  Liquidity providers (LP) are investors who stake their cryptocurrency tokens on decentralized exchanges (DEX) to earn transaction fees, usually in the form of token rewards. Providing liquidity to crypto markets remains a key pillar of the ecosystem – with tens of billions of dollars supplied by users to smart contracts.  But becoming a successful liquidity provider is not as simple as passively depositing assets into a pool and waiting to earn a profit. LPs must address dreaded impermanent loss, smart contract risks and exploits.  The Amberdata report provided a detailed analysis of four Uniswap version (v)2 pools, focusing on their behavior and performance metrics.  The analysis compared the dai (DAI) and ether (ETH) with the ether and USD coin (USDC) pools, which both involve trading ETH against a stablecoin. It also compared the DAI and USDC liquidity pair with a DAI and tether (USDT) pair, which involves trading different stablecoins against each other.  The report found there were significant differences in the capital efficiency and profitability of Uniswap v2 pools. The ETH/USDC pool had higher capital efficiency compared to the DAI/ETH pool, while the DAI/USDT pool had significantly higher capital efficiency than the DAI/USDC pool.  This was due to differences in liquidity among stablecoin pairs that could be attributed to factors such as market demand, availability and investor sentiment.  The demand for a particular stablecoin as a trading pair can influence the liquidity and trading volume in a pool, and therefore impact capital efficiency and profitability.  Additionally, investor sentiment toward a particular stablecoin, such as trust in its stability or market performance, can also impact liquidity and trading volume.  For traders interested in providing liquidity, Amberdata said the factors to consider are the total value locked (TVL) of a pair, the number of trades, or trading volume, per day of the pair, and the characteristics and volatility of the asset itself.  “Our final takeaway is that providing liquidity on Uniswap v2 may be a profitable strategy for those who are looking for a safer way to hold crypto assets,” Amberdata analysts said. “LP strategies perform well in choppy market conditions and do not have significant differences from holding the assets during upward and downward trends.”  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Cosmos ATOM +1.1% Smart Contract Platform Decentraland MANA +0.2% Entertainment  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Dogecoin DOGE −5.3% Currency Chainlink LINK −3.1% Computing Polkadot DOT −3.0% Smart Contract Platform  Important events  9:30 a.m. HKT/SGT(1:30 UTC) Australia Trade Balance (MoM/February)  8:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(12:30 UTC) Canada Unemployment Rate (March)  7:50 a.m. HKT/SGT(23:50 UTC) Japan Overall Household Spending (YoY/February)  CoinDesk TV  In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:  Ether Jumps to Nine-Month High Ahead of Shapella; Citi's Future of Finance Global Head on CBDCs  ""First Mover"" dove into the crypto markets ahead of Shapella, a portmanteau of Shanghai and Capella, two major Ethereum network upgrades expected to occur simultaneously on April 12. Victoria Bills, Banrion Capital Management's chief investment strategist, joined the conversation.
