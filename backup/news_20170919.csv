42427772,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3nlh,1505858449,"Pick n Pay Double Take? The Supermarket Chain Isn't Accepting Bitcoin, It Tested It","South Africa's second-largest supermarket chain tested bitcoin payments earlier this year – but it doesn't plan to roll out the option to its stores anytime soon, according to its CEO.  Pick n Pay, which operates in a number of African countries as well as South Africa, piloted a payment system in partnership with startups Electrum and Luno. That initiative was limited to a staff cafeteria, CEO Richard van Rensburg told BusinessDay in an interview, and is no longer active.  As for when the supermarket chain might expand the option to an actual storefront, van Rensburg demurred, pointing to a difficult regulatory environment as the root cause for hesitation.  He told the publication:  ""We don’t expect that in the near term accepting bitcoin will unlock any significant new business and we are unlikely to roll out the solution until the payments industry and regulatory authorities have established a framework for managing the risks associated with cryptocurrencies.""  That said, van Rensburg struck a positive note about the trial itself and the potential benefits to supermarket operators like Pick n Pay.  ""We have proved to ourselves, though, that it is technically possible to roll out a solution very quickly,"" he added.  News that Pick n Pay was even considering a bitcoin payment option spread earlier this week, leading to inaccurate reports that the supermarket chain was rolling out a fully-fledged payment option. The company confirmed to tech blog MyBroadband that that it wasn't accepting bitcoin at any of its stores.

Ray Dalio is the founder of Bridgewater Associates, which according to recent rankings is the biggest hedge fund by total assets under management. Per its website, Bridgewater manages around $160 billion in assets.  Dalio, who appeared on CNBC's Squawk Box this morning, said that he doesn't think bitcoin is ""an effective storehold of wealth"", comparing it unfavorably to gold.  He said in the interview:  ""It's not an effective storehold of wealth because it has volatility to it, unlike gold. Bitcoin is a highly speculative market. Bitcoin is a bubble.""  While he noted that bitcoin ""could be a currency,"" Dalio argued that a mix of market speculation and the lack of broader adoption is getting in the way  ""It’s a shame, it could be a currency. It could work, conceptually, but the amount of speculation that is going on and the lack of transactions [prevent it],"" he said.  Dalio went on to add that the privacy aspects of bitcoin make it difficult to accept as a currency as well, asserting “people won’t know what you’re doing.""  His comments come as cryptocurrency markets recover from regulatory developments in China, which have seen officials there increasing their scrutiny in the exchange space, trigging a raft of closures and policy changes. At press time, the price of bitcoin is trading at roughly $3,984, per CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).

Yesterday, the US Senate passed a massive defense spending package that provides hundreds of billions of dollars to the US military. Public records show that an amendment included in that bill, proposed by Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, would ""require a report on cyber applications of blockchain technology"" if signed into law.  According to the official Congressional website, the amendment was agreed to by unanimous consent ahead of the defense bill's final vote.  The research effort, according to the amendment's text is described as:  ""...a report on the potential offensive and defensive cyber applications of blockchain technology and other distributed database technologies and an assessment of efforts by foreign powers, extremist organizations, and criminal networks to utilize these technologies.""  The study, additional materials indicate, is expected to be delivered six months after the defense bill is signed into law.  But more steps remain before the study's mandate becomes law, however. The House of Representatives – the lower chamber of the US Congress – passed a similar bill in July, and now the two bodies have to hammer out a reconciled version and pass it.

42427776,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3nvh,1505844069,Ethereum's Byzantium Testnet Just Verified A Private Transaction,"The effort to bring the privacy features of zcash to ethereum took a step forward today during testing for the upcoming Byzantium upgrade.  A zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge, or zkSNARK, is used to prove that data is valid without actually revealing what that data is. The technology sits at the heart of the zcash network, and recent months have seen developers moving to integrate the privacy tech into ethereum.  Earlier today, the zkSNARK part of a zcash transaction was verified on the Byzantium testnet. While only a trial, the development is a critical step toward bringing that kind of functionality to the public ethereum network.  As previously reported, testing on Byzantium is expected to continue into October. Byzantium's formal introduction will then introduce the gas-subsidised pairing checks and elliptic curve operations that make this kind of verification possible.  This means that once Byzantium becomes the law of the land, a cryptographically privatized transaction can be verified on the network.  However, computations for zkSNARKs are costly. The transaction, which is viewable on the test network here, cost a total of 1,933,895 gas. To put this in some context – a non-private transaction currently costs around 21,000 gas, tiny compared to the zcash equivalent.  Beyond the verification, there is still work to be done before private transactions are possible on ethereum.  Christian Reitwiessner, leading zkSNARKs developer for ethereum, told CoinDesk:  ""What is missing after that is basically everything that was missing on top of the Ethereum Virtual Machine in the early times of Ethereum: We need practical implementations of all the other components of a zkSNARK system (apart from the verification).""

42427788,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3oNh,1505840407,Bull Signal? Bitcoin's Price Breaks Above 50-Day Moving Average,"The bitcoin-US dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate closed above the 50-day moving average yesterday – crossing a key milestone for the first time since September 13.  However, while this might be read as a bullish signal, the follow-through has not been encouraging so far. Prices fell to a low of $3,836 earlier today and were last seen trading around $3,990 levels. The 50-day moving average is located at $3,982 levels.  As per CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency has hardly moved in the last 24 hours.  BTC is up 4.5% on the week and month. (Indeed, the lackluster action in the cryptocurrencies is eerily similar to the one seen in equities, currencies, bonds and commodity markets at the moment.)  However, this may be a sign that investors across the various asset classes would prefer to sit on the sidelines ahead of the FOMC rate decision tomorrow. The Fed is widely expected to keep the interest rates unchanged and announce the beginning of the balance sheet taper.  What to watch  Daily chart  Bullish crossovers occur when the short-term moving average (5-day moving average) crosses or cuts the long-term moving average (10-day moving average) from below.  A bullish 5-day moving average and 10-day moving average crossover, if confirmed during the overnight trade, would help bitcoin take out resistance at $4,209 (confluence of falling trend line and 61.8% Fibonacci retracement).  A move above $4,209 would improve the odds of bitcoin rallying to record highs. As discussed yesterday, only a drop below $3,465 (the September 17 low) would revive the bearish view.

42427779,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3o3h,1505836818,Mexican Law Would Give Central Bank Oversight of Cryptocurrency Startups,"Mexico's government is close to introducing legislation that would regulate fintech firms, including those that work with cryptocurrencies.  The latest draft of the bill, according to reports from regional newspaper El Economista and Reuters, would clarify that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are not legal tender in Mexico. Further, the legislation would give the Bank of Mexico, Mexico's central bank, the power to regulate firms working with cryptocurrencies.  The draft states (according to a translation):  ""[Financial technology firms] can only operate with virtual assets that are determined by the Bank of Mexico through general provisions. To carry out operations with such virtual assets, they must have the prior authorization of the Bank of Mexico.""  The text of Mexico's fintech bill has been circulating since this spring, focused on companies that provide ""alternative means of access to finance and investment"" – including those dealing with digital assets and cryptocurrencies. An earlier draft, released back in March, had reportedly contained rules focused on ""institutions dedicated to the purchase and sale of virtual assets,"" though that language has now been dropped.  According to recent statements from Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, the legislation will be introduced by September 20. Reuters reports that it will first be considered by an independent commission, after which it will be sent to the Mexican Senate for further deliberation.  Agustín Carstens, governor of the Bank of Mexico, has previously stated that unless cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are recognised by a bank or government, they do not meet the definition of a currency.  At a lecture at Mexican technical university ITAM in August, Carstens argued that ""technological development in the financial system cannot be the result of innovation alone"", but must occur in tandem with new regulations.

42427787,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3oJh,1505833964,Bullish Breakout: Is Ethereum's Price Heading Back Above $300?,"The ether-U.S. dollar (ETH/USD) exchange rate appears to be responding positively following shocks caused by regulatory actions in China.  Still, the recovery hasn't exactly been a downhill jog. Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, which was just finding its footing following China's ICO ban, took a dive to $198 on Friday – the lowest level since July 31 – after major Chinese exchanges announced they would shut down ether-yuan trading under pressure from regulators.  The sell-off in the cryptocurrencies was short-lived, though, as investors realized that the exchange crackdown would not affect crypto-to-crypto trading. The second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization soon recovered and is back around $285 today.  Looking ahead, expectations are that Chinese investors will likely continue to participate in the market via offshore exchanges. Thus, cryptocurrencies regained their poise on Monday.  Forthcoming technical improvements may also be helping to lift the cryptocurrency.  A new version of ethereum's Geth node software was released Friday – an update that includes various protocol changes for its upcoming ""Metropolis"" hard fork. Ethereum is currently on target to activate the so-called Byzantium upgrade within the next month.  Elsewhere, ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, while speaking to TechCrunch on Monday, notably predicted the platform will match Visa's transaction capacity in a ""couple of years.""  ""Bitcoin is processing a bit less than three transactions per second,"" he said. ""Ethereum is doing five a second. Uber gives 12 rides a second. It will take a couple of years for the blockchain to replace Visa.""  With China seemingly out of the way, investors may push ether back above its 50-day moving average level of $300. As per CoinMarketCap, ether has lost 0.92 percent in the last 24 hours. At press time, the currency is trading at the $285 level. On a weekly basis, the digital currency is down 5.3 percent, due to the China dip.  Bullish falling channel breakout  Daily chart  An upside breakout (as seen on the chart above) is usually the first sign of a bearish-to-bullish trend change.  Investopedia defines ""falling channel"" as the price action contained between two downward sloping parallel lines.  In ether's case, a bullish falling channel breakout can be observed, though it still needs to break above the 50-day moving average level of $300 – in which case, prices could test $345–$350 levels (resistance being offered by the trend line sloping upwards from the July 16 low and July 29 low].  On the downside, only a break below $198 would revive the bearish view and shall open doors for a sell-off to falling channel support of $170-160.

42427803,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3oFh,1505826007,Blockchain Truce? Putin's Internet Adviser Calls for US-Russia Cooperation,"An adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin has a strong message for state governments: stop competing for blockchain dominance.  As China, Russia, the U.S. and other countries around the globe seek to distinguish themselves in the way they regulate their approach to blockchain and cryptocurrencies, Herman Klimenko said that global superpowers should unite to create a coalition centered on blockchain technology.  Instead of competing at the highest level, Klimenko argues that state leaders should use their authority to work together to create the optimal playing field on which global coders and companies can compete.  Speaking with CoinDesk through a translator, the man who was appointed adviser to the Russian President in late 2015 further explained his position:  ""We would like to advise to launch a common platform for your country, for our country, and we can invite other countries to join us, to have one platform for us to exchange the opinions of our authorities and governments.""  As template for how such state-supported blockchain coalition members might be organized Klimenko pointed to the recently created Russian Association of Blockchain and Cryptocurrency (RACIB).  Klimenko helped found RACIB as part of his role as chairman of the board for Russia's Institute for Internet Development and, under the leadership of media entrepreneur Arseniy Sheltsin, the blockchain association is now divided into four areas of focus.  These include cryptocurrencies, ICOs, blockchain as a platform and ""international calculation"" – a focus area that hones in on how the technology might impact global relations. Here, participants have the opportunity to take part in public-private partnerships to build pilots around a number of potential use cases in both the government and corporate sectors.  While each of the four areas has a manager who oversees project coordination, Klimenko said the positions are more of a formality. Instead, he argues the 1,100 members who are currently registered don't ""need physical management in the traditional sense.""  ""In this association, most of what we need from our members is their skills in different directions,"" said Klimenko. ""We don’t have any membership fees, we don't need them, we don't need much in terms of traditional management.""  Consortia wars  If the structure of RACIB sounds familiar, that's because in one way, there's nothing really all that new about it. But that doesn't mean the application of the structure at the state government-level might not result in tangible differences.  While it was individuals who largely helped the first blockchain – bitcoin – reach its current level of adoption, other applications of blockchain have largely depended on consortia of companies organizing around a wide-range of industries. From financial services firms to insurance companies to IT consultancies, it seems most industries have come together to launch blockchain consortia projects in pursuit of increasing efficiency.  But what distinguishes Klimenko's call for multilateral government collaboration on blockchain is the scale of the work, and what such a scale might eventually mean.  The distributed nature of blockchain means it relies largely on the network effects created by having as many people as possible participating – the more people or groups that use a blockchain, the more inefficiencies can be removed from a system and the more robust that system is.  Klimenko positioned the creation of an intergovernmental blockchain group as the removal of the final silo that could be inhibiting the potential benefits of blockchain.  ""The competition is not between governments, but between programmers,"" he said.  As an example of how such inefficiences might be removed by government cooperation, he pointed to the nascent blockchain field of ""telemedecine"" or as Klimenko prefers to call it, ""digital medicine.""  While local reports about the association have largely focused on how it might use the initial coin offering (ICO) funding model as a way to fund internet-enabled medical services, Kilmenko said the research is actually much broader. By standardizing the way government regulators track pharmaceuticals he said new efficiencies could be revealed.  ""If we take the medical data and scan the image from different parts of the world, from Russia, or USA, or China, or a different country, the data is actually the same, it is universal,"" he said.  China concerns  But it may already be too late for Klimenko's vision of cooperative efforts among governments.  In the past month alone, Russia's central bank has indicated it could take a more restrictive stance on cryptocurrency, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has released a report stating ICO tokens may be securities and China has taken the particularly drastic step of stating that ICO tokens are illegal and forcing the closure of bitcoin exchanges.  But as opposed to an outright ban – or other solutions that create silos instead of dismantle them – Kilmenko remains committed to a more nuanced, technology-driven approach.  ""It's very clear the risk of cryptocurrencies and ICOs. And it's also clear there are methods existing to reduce those risks,"" he said. Klimenko is joined in this vision for a more unified global approach by RACIB director, Sheltsin, who is also the CEO of Russian news site, The Runet.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Sheltsin said part of RACIB's ""main goal"" is to help organize ""concerted activity related to distribution of blockchain technology in [the] Russian Federation and beyond its borders.""  He concluded:  ""We think the governments cooperation on blockchain will help us to share the best practices in regulation and to deal with common problems.""

42427783,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3o9h,1505821205,Only in Arizona: How Smart Contract Clarity Is Winning Over Startups,"What happens when someone breaches a contract?  If you've gone through all the rigmarole of developing a paper contract, the legal ramifications are clear. But paper contracts are not only inefficient but also prone to fraud, which is why a group of startups and developers are pushing digital ""smart contract"" systems tied to immutable blockchains.  But what if someone breaches their smart contract? The answer, in most places throughout the world, is less clear. That is, unless you're in Arizona.  Since passing a law in March that enshrined the validity and enforceability of digital signatures recorded on a blockchain, the Grand Canyon State has quietly emerged as a choice location for blockchain companies that develop applications based on the self-executing pieces of code.  For Sweetbridge, a Phoenix-based outfit building a blockchain supply chain finance platform, the law has afforded the company sufficient legal clarity and confidence to begin rolling out operations more aggressively.  Caroline Lynch, Sweetbridge's public policy and legislative advisor, explained that the state's decision to elevate smart contracts to the same legal grounding as traditional contracts has been imperative to the company's growth.  Lynch told CoinDesk:  ""It takes away that one potential area for dispute, if for no other reason than a party to a contract cannot argue that because it was executed through a digital ledger it lacks validity.""  Arizona's legal safe haven  Stepping back, the law in March actually amended the Arizona Electronic Transactions Act (which already stated that records or signatures cannot be denied legal effect and enforceability based on the fact they're in electronic format) to include digital signatures recorded on a blockchain.  It now states: ""A signature that is secured through blockchain technology is considered to be in electronic form and to be an electronic signature ... A record or contract that is secured through blockchain technology is considered to be in an electronic form and to be an electronic record.""  As such, in the event of a dispute or breach of a smart contract, parties have full ability to seek legal recourse in the state's court system.  And with this, business representatives from the state have wasted little time in using the newfound language as a means to lure companies that are flirting with smart contract applications in sectors such as finance, real estate, law, public records and insurance.  According to Darryn Jones, director of business development at the Greater Phoenix Economic Council, because the law is technology neutral, it legitimizes smart contracts regardless of the blockchain on which they choose to build.  Jones went on:  ""From a value proposition standpoint, as we go and recruit companies that are utilizing or developing smart contract software, we can say that this gives them a safe haven for operating in Arizona.""  The business of contracts  For blockchain-based supply chain startups, this small change makes a big difference.  Supply chains, at their core, are distribution channels involving transactions among numerous partners and entities, all with contracts that lay out how each is supposed to act. If those contracts cannot be enforced or accepted in a court of law, the entire viability of the relationship is put in doubt.  ""Eventually, the stuff that you implement and any smart contract code that you put in place to direct business processes or transactions has to stand on legal footing. It has to be enforceable. And if it's not, it's going to fall apart in a second,"" said Todd Taylor, chief executive of Aperio, another Phoenix-based blockchain supply chain startup, and a professor at Arizona State University.  While states such as Vermont and Nevada have passed laws this year aimed to bring additional clarity to blockchain firms, Arizona remains the only state so far to have cemented the enforceability of smart contracts.  Sweetbridge's Lynch, who previously served as chief counsel to the House Judiciary Committee in Washington, D.C., agreed with Taylor, saying the stability is of utmost importance as her company looks to build out its platform and carve its niche in the blockchain world.  And Jones continued:  ""They wouldn't be able to do this in Arizona if we didn’t have this law. These companies would not be able to utilize their coins and their service as a smart contract platform if this enabling legislation was not passed.""  An unusually friendly climate  But supply chain companies aren't the only ones seeing benefit in setting up shop in Arizona.  For instance, Dash Core Team, which oversees the development of dash – the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization – has established a hub in an incubator run by Arizona State University.  Ryan Taylor, CEO of Dash Core Team, said his company has developed several successful partnerships with Phoenix-area businesses by way of city and state government officials making introductions. For example, Arizona State University launched a blockchain research lab in partnership with Dash, and is working on a blockchain certificate program for interested students.  ""They're connecting the dots actively; they're making this a priority,"" he said. ""They're going to find ways to help the industry flourish, and that's huge, because I'd say, in most geographies, the politicians don't feel that same way and they don't even understand the technology.""  Observers say the law's passage is indicative of a surprising, if not rare, willingness among the state's political elites to overlook certain negative stereotypes in favor of how blockchain technology can be leveraged for economic development purposes.  ""The bill that was passed tees us up in a way that it's the start of many good things that we expect to come from our legislative bodies,"" said Rhonda Milligan, co-founder of Sweetbridge.  Earlier this month, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich announced his intent to establish the country's first regulatory sandbox for financial technology, a category many blockchain startups fall under.  Dash's Taylor concluded:  ""I think that business groups and government officials could learn a lot from looking at what Arizona is doing to ensure that they have a seat at the table when it comes to this new emerging field.""

The simulated hard fork was executed this morning on Ropsten, the ethereum testing environment, and is expected to run for a few weeks of troubleshooting before the fork occurs on the main ethereum blockchain, currently the world's second-largest by market capitalization.  The testing period will involve a trial of the nine EIPs (ethereum improvement protocols) to be introduced in the Byzantium hardfork. As previously detailed by CoinDesk, the code updates will introduce changes to increase the functionality of the network while minimizing potential exploits and also paving the way for novel cryptography on the ethereum platform.  Looking ahead, testing will likely take about three weeks, suggesting the actual Byzantium hard fork is likely to occur sometime around October 9. However, this is contingent on whether the test does not cause unanticipated problems.  Speaking at the ethereum core dev meet up on September 8, ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin said he expected the testing period will require around three to four weeks.

42427773,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3nnh,1505815255,Proof of Space: BitTorrent Creator Publishes Eco-Friendly Mining Paper,"BitTorrent developer Bram Cohen has published a new white paper that envisions an eco-friendly alternative to bitcoin's energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus method.  Dubbed ""proof-of-space,"" the method relies on disk space rather than computational power as the main resource for mining (the process by which new transactions are added to a blockchain), creating what is claimed to be a less ecologically damaging and more economical alternative to proof-of-work.  Cohen spoke to CoinDesk back in March about his efforts to develop the solution, work that set the stage for this week's white paper release.  The paper, ""Beyond Hellman's Time-Memory Trade-Offs with Applications to Proofs of Space,"" outlines the use of proof-of-space to establish a mining process that requires less energy (and the natural resources to produce it). Because of the reduction in energy requirements, as well as the reliance on pre-existing hardware, the proposed method is aimed at making mining accessible to anyone with a computer.  Under the proof-of-space system, miners allocate unused disk space to the network, with the probability of successfully mining a block being proportional to the amount of space allocated divided by the total capacity of the network.  In addition to Cohen, the white paper credits Hamza Abusalah, Joel Alwen and Krzysztof Pietrzak from the Institute of Science and Technology Austria, Danylo Khilko from ENS Paris and Leonid Reyzin from Boston University as authors.  It still remains to be seen, however, whether the paper will serve as the basis for a new cryptocurrency, with Cohen telling CoinDesk in March that he doesn't see much need to create a new one.  ""For the most part there shouldn't be the need [to launch new coins],"" he said, adding:  ""But I have this idea about underlying mining and how it works that does make it inherently different.""

42427774,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3nrh,1505811619,The Economic Case for Conservative Bitcoin Development,"Ariel Deschapell is a full-stack javascript developer teaching at the Ironhack coding bootcamp in Miami, and a recent Henry Hazlitt fellow in Digital Development at the Foundation for Economic Education.  In this opinion piece, Deschapell discusses the tensions underlying bitcoin's scaling debate, arguing those who have approached the protocol's design with more caution are perhaps doing so with history on their side.      The way we think about bitcoin, its use cases and its subsequent road to adoption fundamentally underlies the scaling and governance debates at the heart of forks like bitcoin cash and Segwit2x.  As an unprecedented technology, bitcoin's refusal to fit into any predefined conceptual pigeonhole continues to give fits to regulators and traditional financial intermediaries alike. But, this presents a problem to its advocates too, who rely on their own idealistic notions and necessarily incomplete understandings of bitcoin.  Economically, the way we think about bitcoin is also shaped by the way traditional money and payment systems have evolved and developed. These systems are our only frame of reference, but in using them as such, we must make use of sound economic theory or risk many intellectual pitfalls.  At the center of these considerations is the idea of bitcoin as a new type of money. Given its use as a means of exchange in many online and in-person payment gateways, it seems to be an easy jump to call it money just like the U.S. dollar or Japanese yen. Bitcoin was originally proposed as a ""peer-to-peer digital cash"" after all, and its most ardent maximalists aspire to have it replace the national patchwork of fiat currencies as the primary means of exchange around the globe.  However, bitcoin is not money – at least not yet.  Believing otherwise based on its use and characteristics as a usable medium of exchange is an erroneous conclusion, and worse, it can lead to problematic and ultimately harmful implications for its future development.  To ultimately have the best chance of establishing bitcoin as money, we must understand the nature and origin of money, and in that context the technical challenges facing any cryptocurrency.  The origin of money  Long prior to bitcoin, the economist Ludwig von Mises ingeniously articulated and expanded upon the Austrian school of economic thought regarding the nature and evolution of money.  In what is known as the ""regression theorem,"" Mises observed that all money originates as a universally valuable commodity before it ascends to becoming a medium of exchange, and then only subsequently, money proper. This was why the first widely used mediums of exchange were metals such as gold and silver.  These commodities were valued for their unique properties, ones which would also later make them very effective means of exchange and ultimately good money.  Gold and silver were both aesthetically attractive and relatively easy to clean. However, they were also malleable, easily divisible and completely uniform. Gradually, over thousands of years, these commodities supplanted barter as a much more efficient way to stimulate trade for ancient peoples.  In turn, this gave way to more convenient ""banknotes,"" or claims on gold and silver in a vault, and of course, fiat money, as governments discovered the power of appropriating control of the money supply. Digital replacements for this legal tender came even later.  This evolution of money took place gradually over thousands of years – and bitcoin stands in stark contrast. From its inception, dividing and sending bitcoins to and from addresses was a fairly trivial task. Within a few years, spending it at a number of online websites and even brick-and-mortar stores was a straightforward affair.  To the casual observer, it may seem as if bitcoin disproved Mises's regression theorem: a purely conceptual number on a ledger that spawned from nothing and became a means of exchange almost overnight.  If only it was that simple.  The money test  At this point, it's necessary to identify what money is and why it matters.  As defined by Merriam-Webster:  ""Something generally accepted as a medium of exchange, a measure of value, or a means of payment.""  Wikipedia's definition:  ""Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a particular country or socio-economic context.""  The common denominator here is ""generally accepted,"" a standard that is a bit arbitrary but nonetheless is hardly met by bitcoin today.  Yes, many goods and services can be bought with bitcoin. But this doesn't make it money any more than the hypothetical ability to spend wheat futures digitally would make wheat futures money.  It is technically possible to accomplish this much the same way as the majority of bitcoin commercial transactions work in practice: by instantly converting what the merchant receives into fiat currency, the real money still making this exchange possible.  Confusion on this point stems from our historical experience of currency (dollar, yen) and the systems used to facilitate their transfer of ownership (debit cards, checks, bank wires) being traditionally separate.  Bitcoin meshes the two into one. The protocol both establishes a provably scarce digital good and easily facilitates changes in their ownership regardless of geographic space. Yet, while this technological property gives the token significant utility and makes it easy to spend with the use of clever software and third parties, it does not make bitcoin money.  For bitcoin to be considered money, it must be generally accepted and used within a closed loop. Merchants must not only much more widely accept it as a payment option, but also feel fully confident in holding the actual bitcoin itself.  Establishing a store of value  After establishing that bitcoin cannot yet be considered money, suddenly the regression theorem becomes far more interesting and practical. If bitcoin is not money, then what is it? The only remaining answer is a valuable commodity, which brings us to the very beginning of the regression theorem.  Like gold and silver, bitcoin possesses unique properties that are valued by individuals. The fact that it remains entirely digital is not a problem conceptually, it only makes it unprecedented and therefore harder to grasp. But physicality isn't a necessary prerequisite for a good to have market value.  The only prerequisite is scarcity. Through the ingenuity of its blockchain architecture, bitcoins became the first provably scarce digital good.  The attractive properties of this digital good can be said to include its extreme divisibility, fungibility and its hard limit on supply. Still, other alternative currencies were created in the past with all these properties, including the Liberty Dollar and E-Gold. These attempts were quickly shuttered by governments in the interest of maintaining their monopoly on currency issuance.  Bitcoin was different for what quickly became and remains its foremost feature: its resistance to censorship.  This is the bedrock of bitcoin's usefulness as a store of value. The ability to hold wealth outside the system and largely outside of its reach is the original killer application for bitcoin. It is tied to the protocols functions of both establishing a scarce store of value and facilitating their transfer, regardless of physical space or the objection of any single third party.  However, to take this functionality for granted betrays a massive under-appreciation, if not complete misunderstanding, of the technology involved and its very real limits.  In software as with the world, security and safety are never a permanent state of affairs. Any computer network ever devised can be attacked, and attacked successfully at a high enough cost. Bitcoin's brilliance is that its incentive architecture and resulting infrastructure makes the cost to attack and successfully disrupt the network very high.  The fact that it has been running without interruption for close to nine years is nothing short of a software miracle that speaks to the ingenuity and brilliance of the system's design. However, past performances are never a guarantee of future results. This is even more so when it comes to something still as new and experimental as bitcoin.  The real challenge  To see why this is the case, we have to understand basic risk and threat analysis.  Imagine a computer system that, if compromised, gives an attacker $100. Now, if the cost to compromise that system is $10, then doing so is a worthwhile endeavor. However, if the cost to do so is instead $200, it clearly is not. In this simplistic example, the system can be considered hypothetically secure only in the latter case.  To date, it can be said the cost of disrupting bitcoin has always exceeded the value of doing so, as is evidenced by its successful continued operation. While quantitatively measuring the cost of compromising the bitcoin network is tricky at best, let's first assume that it remains fixed.  If bitcoin continues to grow and add value to its ecosystem, the potential returns to be made in disrupting it also continue to increase. If the cost of compromising it remains the same all the while, it must eventually become cost-effective for some entity of sufficient resources to indeed compromise it. By its ambitious nature, there is no shortage of large and resourceful entities which bitcoin's success continues to threaten.  Indeed the larger and more successful it becomes the greater the size, number, and motivation of such potential adversaries.  We've established that to become money bitcoin must be generally accepted and used within a closed loop. This is only possible if it first becomes a stable store of value, and even this long process has a necessary prerequisite: that bitcoin continues to be a secure store of value.  For it to ever have a chance at accomplishing this demands then that it must not only just maintain its security as it continues to scale to and increase in value. It must actually increase security as the network continues to scale and increase in value.  Cart before the horse  This is the central challenge facing bitcoin scalability.  It is not enough for it to simply handle more and more transactions cheaply. It must do so while preserving its most foundational feature, that of censorship resistance. Only by accomplishing that can it remain a trusted store of value on a fundamental technical level, and only after continuously proving this with more users and more wealth can it gain enough adoption and market confidence that it ultimately becomes a stable store of value. Then only subsequently can it become money  Only by accomplishing that can it remain a trusted store of value on a fundamental technical level, and only after continuously proving this with more users and more wealth can it gain enough adoption and market confidence that it becomes a stable store of value. Then only subsequently can it become money proper.  Assuming bitcoin is money first and foremost today, and concluding that it must immediately compete with the transaction times and fees of popular money transmitter apps like Venmo, is putting the cart before the horse.  Even worse, these assumptions have led to proposals that proactively sacrifice network security in favor of cheaper fees and other such secondary concerns.  This is the reason why I've previously written that the trade-offs from increasing the block limit as implemented by bitcoin cash and proposed by Segwit2x are not advantageous. There is problematic reasoning behind how such proposal increase the rate of adoption and very real long-run security concerns that remain unaddressed.  Of course, it is possible to disagree on these finer points. One can agree with the sentiment expressed here and also earnestly believe that the block size or other protocol changes won't fatally impact block propagation, node numbers or miner centralization. Open discussion, debate and even open competition is key to finding the best way forward.  However, given the undeniable and fundamental importance of bitcoin's censorship resistance in its value proposition, the burden of proof clearly rests on those who would change the protocol to show how such changes either do not impact the network's distribution and security, or why such a tradeoff is otherwise desirable or urgently necessary.  Censorship resistance is simply too important to risk, especially when more secure approaches to scaling are readily available.  An issue of perspective  Bitcoin is not a short-term project or investment. Neither is its continued success a sure thing.  Make no mistake, continuing to upgrade bitcoin to handle true widespread adoption while maintaining its censorship resistance is a monumental task fraught with many risks and unknowns. Accomplishing this would be nothing short of an unprecedented feat of software engineering and human coordination, and would likely have a larger societal impact than any single previous technological advancement in history.  There exist no shortcuts through the careful and intelligent development needed to make this dream a reality.  Those who are impatient for bitcoin's widespread adoption and use as money should look back at the history of traditional money for a sense of perspective. It took millennia for gold and silver to be established as universal means of exchange and money proper. It took centuries if not millennia more for these to be replaced by more abstract concepts such as banknotes and fiat currency.  By comparison, bitcoin is the first scarce digital good, and the first instance of a whole new asset class spontaneously appearing from the ether. With this in mind, the progress it has made in nine short years is both shocking and awe-inspiring.  Needless to say, it will take much longer than a decade for markets to fully embrace bitcoin with the same faith they have in fiat currencies today. But should it take even 100 years to accomplish this, it would remain a blink in the eye of history.  A blink, we are all lucky enough to get to see.
