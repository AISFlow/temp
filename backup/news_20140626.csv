42425815,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgNPh,1403816448,Police Still Searching for Answers in Investigation of HKCex Exchange,"Hong Kong's police force continues to investigate HKCex after a customer lodged a report of fraudulent activity in May, claiming he was unable to withdraw 16.5 BTC from the cryptocurrency exchange.  The customer, Dominic Rivers, told CoinDesk he then made a statement to the Hong Kong police's Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on 3rd June, explaining:  ""I hope [the police] track these guys down. I hope an example is made of them and I hope I get my money back.""  According to the case's investigating officer, however, progress has been slow. The officer said he had written to MG Foreign Exchange Limited, which was listed as the owner of HKCex on its website, but has received no reply.  The news comes amid continued uncertainty regarding the Hong Kong-based exchange, which had previously boasted upwards of $20m in funding, among a number of increasingly troubling claims.  An earlier investigation into HKCex by CoinDesk revealed that its investment and partnership claims with companies like Hang Seng Bank, Foxconn and the insurer AIA were false.  Lone complaint  The investigating officer told CoinDesk he would be contacting the firm again, but added that no other reports on the matter had been lodged.  Further, he indicated that following up on the report has posed its own issues:  ""We are still working on the case, but in fact, I can honestly tell you we have encountered difficulties [...] we can't confirm where the bitcoin is.""  Rivers said he had also written to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit, which investigates suspicious financial activity in the Special Administrative Region, but received no response from them.  He had been attracted to HKCex by the arbitrage opportunity provided with its high BTC prices – buying bitcoin on Bitfinex to sell them on HKCex. Like other customers, his troubles started when he attempted to withdraw his funds.  River's withdrawal was delayed, with the exchange requesting a notarised copy of his passport – a frustration other customers of the exchange have also complained of.  Searching for answers  In Rivers' case, he was away from Hong Kong when he received the request from HKCex. He then asked his wife to get a copy of his passport notarised and drop it off at the HKCex address listed on its website.  When she arrived at the address, however, she couldn't find the exchange's office.  ""My wife took it along to the address where I was supposed to post it, but there was nothing there. There is a 7-11, a kindergarten and some apartments. None of them had anything to identify them as HKCex,"" he said.  Rivers, who is a pilot and former server engineer, is now convinced that HKCex was an ""elaborate hoax"" designed to dupe traders like him who performed some cursory checks on the exchange before trading. He added:  ""It didn't seem like a one-man band. There was a lot of background information about it. They did quite a lot of homework, a lot of preparation work.""  According to a crowdsourced spreadsheet by HKCex customers, the exchange owes $133,765 worth of withdrawals in bitcoin, litecoin and namecoin. The website – HKCex.net – no longer loads.

42425802,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgN7h,1403812852,US Consumer Protection Agency Asked to Boost Bitcoin Oversight,"UPDATE (27th June 19:25 BST): The full GAO report is now available and can be found here.      The US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), an independent federal agency tasked with policing financial products, is preparing to take its first steps toward increasing oversight of bitcoin following a request from a separate government agency.  Bloomberg reports that the Government Accountability Office (GAO), which oversees Congressional spending and policies, formally asked the CFPB to look into digital currencies earlier this year.  In a letter obtained by Bloomberg, the GAO said that it wants US consumer finance regulators be more involved in regulating digital currencies.  The CFPB later reportedly told the GAO that it would look into digital currencies in a letter dated 6th May, saying:  ""We’re looking forward to increasing our involvement in formal working groups as they engage on specific issues relating to consumer protection.""  It’s not clear how the CFPB would be tasked with creating new rules for bitcoin and other digital currencies, as the GAO letter did not outline recommendations for investigation. However, the CFPB's primary role in other matters is to provide educational materials and hear customer complaints.  Given this mandate, it’s likely that the agency will seek to take protective measures to reduce the risk of financial fraud and abuse in the ecosystem.  Notably, former CFPB Deputy Director Raj Date has been a vocal proponent of digital currencies, lauding the industry for its new and innovative approach to finance in April comments.

42425826,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgNdh,1403811322,"How the US Government's Sale of 30,000 BTC Could Impact Bitcoin Prices","On Friday, 27th June, the US government is set to auction off 10 blocks of bitcoin, equaling the roughly 30,000 BTC confiscated during the shutdown of infamous online black market Silk Road.  Once complete, winners will get a bill of sale from the government, and the coins will then be transferred from government ownership to private parties. Those final movements will be seen on the block chain.  However, exactly how much information will eventually be made available about the auction and its winners through official channels is still unclear. Speaking to CoinDesk, a representative from the US Marshals Service (USMS), the federal agency charged with carrying out the sale of the assets, indicates that it is not certain whether the organisation will issue any information about the winners.  Should such a statement be made by the USMS, the representative suggested, it would not be distributed until 30th June, the Monday following the auction.  The potential absence of an official release is notable, as the identity of the buyers and the final sale price of the bitcoins is likely to influence the price of bitcoin. Still, even without such details, the day's events are likely to weigh heavily on traders and investors.  Harry Yeh, managing partner for San Francisco-based Binary Financial, a firm that is bidding on all 10 blocks of BTC, said those involved in the market should be primed to react, stating:  ""We expect on the day for there to be an increased volume of trading and heavy selling pressure.""  Expect volatility  One of the central reasons many suspect the auction will have an effect on the price of bitcoin is the historical evidence that such news events cause turbulence in the market. For example, reports that the government would sell the roughly 30,000 seized bitcoin from Silk Road caused the price to behave erratically on 18th June.  The development is just one of a number of news events that have affected prices, a fact acknowledged by Gil Luria, managing director of bitcoin-friendly investment firm Wedbush Securities.  Addressing the impact the final auction news could have on the market, Luria told CoinDesk:  ""Bitcoin has such a wide range of outcomes. I would be very surprised if the price of bitcoin didn't fluctuate a lot.""  In the 24-hour period following the initial auction announcement, the price of bitcoin dropped more than $60 from $633.84 down to $565.28 – a 10% decrease overall.  As the chart illustrates, recoveries were also made following that day's low.  Over that following weekend, the price dipped further, hitting $553.28 before hovering back around the $600 range.  As such, any current volatility in the market could be magnified by traders and investors who are themselves fearful of continued fluctuations. Not wanting to risk their bottom lines, some may cash out of the bitcoin market to reduce any potential losses.    Still, Brett Stapper of Falcon Global Capital, which previously sought to purchase seized coins but is not participating in the auction, told CoinDesk he believes such uncertainty has been present in the market for some time:      ""I feel that the government having such a large number of bitcoins in their control has created a lot of uncertainty within the industry. Speculation as to if, when, and how they would liquidate has been a topic of discussion since October.""              Stapper's comments suggest that traders may even welcome the final relief of knowing that the 30,000 BTC has found a home on the open market and potentially respond accordingly.    Buyer advantage  Yeh told CoinDesk that even from his perspective as a bidder, the auction process is filled with uncertainty. For example, he says his organisation hasn't received any clarity on what amount he should bid at the auction or if its bid will be accepted.  Despite this, he believes being involved in the auction is better than trying to buy large quantities of BTC on the open market.  Binary Financial and other investment firms like SecondMarket are all putting in bids for the seized coins in part because of intrinsic advantages to bulk bitcoin buying. Many of these types of organizations buy large amounts of bitcoin over the counter or off of exchanges for principal investment funds, and they describe this experience as problematic.  Yeh said an exchange order in the thousands may not fill, or at the very least would cost a huge premium for customers.  Yeh told CoinDesk:  ""If you look at the digital depth chart, which is very unique to bitcoin, for you to actually buy say 3,000 BTC on the market right now, you would end up paying $50 in slippage fees per bitcoin.""  Yeh is referring to the depth charts that have been developed to show bid and ask sides of the bitcoin market.  It's a visualization of bitcoin orders which he says is signature to cryptocurrencies.  The more bitcoins purchased, the higher price will rise – and quite steadily when trying to procure thousands of coins on an open market such as Bitstamp.  Yeh also isn't alone in thinking that, despite any price ramifications, the auction presents a prime buying opportunity.  Jaron Lukasiewicz, CEO of bitcoin exchange Coinsetter, said:  ""It will be much cheaper to buy bitcoins through the auction than the open market. This is a great opportunity for anyone looking to make a multi-million dollar bitcoin purchase.""  Auction price  It is difficult to forecast what price or prices the 10 blocks of bitcoin will go for, but since the auction bids will only be accepted on one day, Friday, 27th June – the market price on that date will likely be a baseline for making bids.  Yeh said he sees the market going either way:  ""I think there’s only going to be two scenarios. There’s either going to be a ridiculous premium, or there is going to be a ridiculous discount.""  Though prospective investors might obtain large blocks of bitcoin from a government without any sort of exchange or over-the-counter added expense, there may be a premium above the market price of that day.  Still, some bidders may think buying in bulk at the auction will result in low competition for premium bids.  Taking a gamble by bidding much lower than market value is entirely possible given knowledge the government will profit from the auction regardless.  ""If I was bidding, I’d probably [go] with a discounted bid,"" said Dan Held, a product manager for bitcoin information resource Blockchain.info.  Avish Bhama is the CEO of Vaurum, a bitcoin exchange built for financial institutions. He confirmed that his company is helping at least two bidders in the auction.  Bhama told CoinDesk:  ""I do think that the bids will be quite competitive with market pricing, so there will be a rally after the auction.""  The second auction  Despite fears of a sizable market reaction, the current auction is just a preview of what may become a larger second auction. Based on the wallet labeled “DPR Seized Coins 2”, the government has control over an additional 144,000 seized bitcoins confiscated from alleged Silk Road mastermind Ross Ulbricht.  Ulbricht sued the US government to protest the sale of the assets, temporarily keeping this large block of coins off the market.  With this total factored in, the government currently has 174,000 BTC in its possession. And with 12,922,425 BTC in circulation right now, the US government publicly owns over 1% of all bitcoin created.  As such, this auction may serve as a sample for how future sales of seized bitcoin will affect its price.  However, fears about this larger quantity of coins reaching the market may be overblown, suggested Luria, who has written four research reports on bitcoin for Wedbush:  ""Bitcoin trades more than 30,000 BTC a day on an ordinary basis. So the auction only represents one day, or less than that, of trading volume. So [this auction] shouldn’t have that much of an impact.""  But, Luria conceded that when the news comes out regarding how much bidders paid for the blocks of bitcoin, it will have an impact on the markets.  ""If the auction ends up getting done at a price lower than the market price,"" he said, ""when it's announced, that will probably put a little more pressure on the price of bitcoin. If the auction is done and the price ends up being at a premium, I think that will have a positive impact on price"".

American Banker  has been one of the more vocal mainstream publications on the subject of bitcoin, with Executive Editor Marc Hochstein even serving as MC and panel speaker at April's Inside Bitcoins NY conference.  The event, to be held on 29th July in New York City, will focus on how bitcoin and digital currencies are impacting a diverse array of industries, including foreign exchange, remittances, online payments and more.  Hochstein, who will serve as conference chairman, said that the conference will also take aim at the distorted ways that bitcoin is often portrayed by mainstream news publications, saying:  ""Our conference will cut through the sensationalism and rhetoric that have clouded the conversation around this technology and hone in on the business possibilities opened up by decentralized electronic ledgers.""  Keynote speakers for the event include Ripple Labs CEO Chris Larsen and Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire.  Traditional financial giants will also be represented by Lester Joseph, Manager of Wells Fargo's financial crimes intelligence group; Jordan Modell, CEO of Internet Archive Federal Credit Union; and David Cotney, chairman of the CSBS Emerging Payments Task Force.

42425809,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgNJh,1403801731,Swiss Report Lays Foundation for Bitcoin to Become Legal Money,"Switzerland's Federal Council, the nation's seven-member executive branch, issued a new 25-page report on digital currencies yesterday, which sought to broadly define how it believes specific bitcoin businesses should be regulated under existing law.  The news comes as a result of a September request by Swiss Socialist Party member Jean Christophe Schwaab for the organisation to pen the report, one which was formally accepted as an initiative by the Federal Council in December.  The Federal Council has the ability to create ordinances, but only the parliament is able to create legislation, meaning that whiles its ultimate recommendation – that no new regulation need be enacted – will set a significant and lengthy legal precedent, the report does not have the legal standing to determine whether bitcoin falls under specific regulation directly. Such decisions remain the responsibility of the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).  Schwaab told CoinDesk: ""The report is only the opinion of the government, but its not legally binding"".  Community triumph  Still, the overall clarity provided by the report has been lauded by members of the local bitcoin ecosystem.  Alexis Roussel, CEO of Switzerland-based digital currency broker SBEX, indicated that the recommendations will do much to bring stability to the region's businesses, telling CoinDesk:  ""We can now expect the following: no legislation change within the next two years [and] a good development of administrative doctrine around bitcoin.""  Bitcoin Association Switzerland  (BAS), the local bitcoin trade association, was similarly positive in its review of the government's analysis, stating:  ""The report concludes that bitcoin is covered by existing laws and that no new regulation is needed. This is excellent news and in full accordance with our views.""  The BAS added that the report even suggests there is a clear path for bitcoin to one day be awarded the legal status of 'money' in Switzerland, noting ""the report says the only thing bitcoin currently lacks to be money [...] is low volatility"".  However, this was just one of the report's many takeaways for local operators, as well as international firms seeking guidance on how to best serve the international banking leader's domestic market.  VAT unlikely  Perhaps most notably for local users, the report suggests that bitcoins be treated as neither a good or a service when used as a means of payment. As such, its language suggests no value-added tax (VAT) should be applied during payments.  The recommendation represents a break from potential applications in German law that would seek to tax bitcoins that are exchanged between merchants and buyers during purchases.  Still, BAS president Luzius Meisser, suggests that such an interpretation is not quite clear.  ""We have another strong clue that bitcoin is exempt from VAT. To be 100% sure, we need to wait for the pending report from the [Swiss Federal Tax Administration].""  When bitcoin is used as a means of payment in the sale or exchange of goods and services, the Federal Council report found that such activities should not be subject to financial market laws.  The report explains that ""bitcoins are a means of payment which in turn can be used to acquire goods or services"". This exempts bitcoin payments from the Banking Act, ""since no monies or bitcoins are collected by a party"".  Added rules for deposits  However, certain acts, such as the Federal Act on Banks and Savings Banks, the Federal Act on Stock Exchanges and the Securities Trading and the Federal Act on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism in the Financial Sector, should apply for businesses conducting bitcoin transactions that are considered deposits, the report says.  The report explains that transactions should be considered deposits ""if a bitcoin dealer accepts credit balances in official currencies on the dealer's own accounts with a view to future currency transactions"", or ""if the dealer accepts bitcoins from clients for future exchanges transactions and the client is not able to dispose of the bitcoins at all times without the involvement of the dealer"".  In the event that such a company went bankrupt, the report argues, bitcoins would be considered bankruptcy assets on an equal level as credit balances accepted in money.  Still, the report makes room for exceptions. For example, the report states ""it is still possible in accordance with the practice of FINMA to prevent applicability of the Banking Act if a bank supervised by FINMA guarantees full repayment of the deposits"".  Rules for trading platforms  Trading platforms, defined as those that both bring together and assign buyers and sellers, should be governed under existing Swiss market laws, the report says.  Here again, the report makes a distinction between bitcoin businesses that hold balances and those that do not, stating: ""it matters whether the operator accepts credit balances in money for this purpose from users of the platform on the operator's own accounts, or whether the operator accepts bitcoins from users which the clients are not able to dispose of at all times without the involvement of the operator"".  Deposits without this control are deemed to be deposits under the Banking Act, ""if the operator maintains credit balances in money or bitcoins for the user on a commercial and permanent basis, and which can be employed by the user for the future purchase and sale of bitcoins via the platform"".  Anti-money laundering laws should not apply to both types of bitcoin exchange platforms, however.  For example, the report reasons that operators who bring together parties for the buying and selling of bitcoin do not need to conduct AML due diligence.  Criminal code applications  When looking at bitcoin's applications to the existing Swiss criminal code, the Federal Council believes that bitcoin exchange operators ""may be subject to punishment for money laundering"" under Article 305.  The report suggested AML penalties would apply when a ""person operates a trading platform for virtual currencies and thereby carries out an act that is aimed at frustrating the identification of the origin, the tracing, or the forfeiture of assets which the person knows or must assume originate from a felony"".  Since digital currencies also qualify as property, the report noted that certain penalties for the misappropriation, fraud and unlawful use of financial assets may also apply in such instances.  The Anti-Money Laundering Act primarily applies to 'financial intermediaries', a term that the report deems to refer to bitcoin businesses that require a banking licence. Still, the AML regulations may apply to bitcoin businesses that fall outside this definition, extending to trading activities covered by the law.  Bitcoin businesses governed by the law must in turn conduct ""due diligence requirements for the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing"". This includes filing reports with the Money Laundering Reporting Office Switzerland (MROS) if they believe individuals are laundering money or otherwise operating with criminal intent.  Individual bitcoin users who pay for goods and services in bitcoins should not be subject to any AML laws, the report suggests. Professional bitcoin traders, by comparison, should conduct some verification depending on the size of the transaction, even in some instances when they do not maintain a business relationship.  ATMs are money transmitters  The report further included echoes of the country's recent decision to allow bitcoin ATM operators to deploy machines, provided they applied for a money transmission licence.  The Financial Council indicated it believes that bitcoin exchange machines are not performing currency exchange, but rather money transmission, as it would be possible for the cash deposited in one machine to be withdrawn at another location.  Such a transfer abilities are indeed a cornerstone of Robocoin's efforts to become a global remittance service and bank, with a new set of features and hardware launched this month.  The report indicated that while a small difference, it is not insignificant, stating: ""The distinction is relevant in that money transmitting is always deemed to be on a professional basis due to the associated higher risks of money laundering"".  Bitcoin as foreign currency  The report also weighed in on the subject of whether bitcoins constitute money in the traditional sense. While the Federal Council deemed bitcoin does not meet this definition at present, it did say that it exhibits ""key features of money"", that in turn makes current regulations applicable in their exchange.  ""They are units of value with which real goods and services can be acquired, which are accepted by a community as means of payment, and whose financial value doesn’t depend on their intrinsic value,"" the report said.  As a result, Switzerland seems to suggest that bitcoin should be treated as a foreign currency, an opinion increasingly being advocated for internationally.  The report stated: ""If it is also taken into account that the exchange of bitcoins into official currencies is in principle possible at all times and without restrictions, there is no reason to treat such exchange activities differently from the exchange of foreign currencies"".  Lingering questions  Meisser, while positive about the implications of the report, sees one area where the guidance falls short. He stated that, from a legal point of view, the Federal Council has not clearly given an opinion of how bitcoin miners should be treated under the law.  Meisser indicated that since bitcoin miners processes transactions, they could be considered financial intermediaries under the Federal Council's interpretation, and be subject to the suggested regulations for these entities.  Meisser said:  ""[Calling bitcoin miners financial intermediaries] would, in my opinion, be wrong since. Unlike banks – bitcoin miners cannot embezzle the bitcoins they process.""  As such, Meisser suggests Switzerland's government may need to make further announcements to provide full clarity to the local bitcoin ecosystem.  Of course, individual business models are likely to cause complications, matters that the report says will be determined by FINMA, as this falls ""within the scope of its duties"".

42425817,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgNVh,1403797317,"Boost VC, Battery Ventures Lead BlockScore's $2 Million Seed Round","UPDATE (26th June 19:00 BST): Updated with commentary from BlockScore president Christopher Morton      Palo Alto-based identity verification service BlockScore has raised $2m in a seed funding round from a range of high-profile investors.  Notable names in the round include bitcoin exchange software provider Vaurum investor Battery Ventures, bitcoin enthusiast Jeremy Liew’s Lightspeed Venture Partners and Adam Draper’s Boost VC, a firm that has pledged to accelerate 100 bitcoin companies through till 2017.  The funding comes at a time when BlockScore is aggressively expanding beyond its roots in the bitcoin ecosystem. The company now serves a wide range of clients with its ID verification services – including e-commerce marketplaces, financial institutions and digital currency startups, and reports that it grew by 200% in the last month alone.  Christopher Morton, president of BlockScore, told CoinDesk he sees his company's funding success as a win for the wider bitcoin ecosystem, saying:  ""We are excited to remove some of the most significant barriers. We envision a day where banks and regulators will treat bitcoin companies like any other business.""  Additional investors in the seed round included New Atlantic Ventures, Khosla Ventures and startup incubator Y Combinator, which recently accepted bitcoin ATM manufacturer BitAccess onto its program.  The news follows the March launch of the company's international APIs and its website redesign in February.  Bitcoin roots  As evidenced by the investors participating in the round, BlockScore has strong connections to the bitcoin community. BlockScore CEO John Backus met co-founder and CTO Alan Meier at a meeting of the Stanford Bitcoin Group, an organization the pair also founded.  Despite the fact that the company has moved away from its early days serving only bitcoin wallets, exchanges and miners, Meier noted the company is still happy to assist those companies in the industry, telling CoinDesk in February:  ""We do love to help bitcoin companies in particular.”  Bitcoin companies can choose between several price plans, including a pay-as-you-go offering with no monthly fee and a plan for larger operations that charges $0.80 per verification.  Once enabled, BlockScore asks customers to provider their name, address, date of birth and either their passport number or the last four digits of their Social Security number. This information is then checked against private and public databases.  Positive reaction  BlockScore indicated in February that its bitcoin service was already proving popular among at least one sector of the industry – bitcoin ATM operators, though it was also serving exchange and wallet providers.  Meier told CoinDesk that the company's software had helped these community members better meet anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) compliance in the face of the then increasing regulatory attention on the industry.  Meier said:  ""We’ve heard some very, very good feedback. Essentially, when they implement our stuff, people just don’t need to worry about half of the compliance they had to worry about before.""

42425819,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgNZh,1403795765,OECD Paper: Policymakers Should Explore Cryptocurrency Technologies,"The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has published a working paper on bitcoin that draws largely positive conclusions about the technology behind the digital currency.  The paper, titled 'The Bitcoin Question: Currency Versus Trust-less Transfer Technology', concludes that while there are concerns about bitcoin related to tax evasion, fraud and money laundering, for example, the bitcoin protocol could have a significant role to play in the financial system:  ""The technology associated with cryptocurrencies [...] could ultimately shift the entire basis of trust involved in any financial transaction. It is an innovation that creates the ability to carry out transactions without the need for a trusted third-party.""  The working paper is written by Adrian Blundell-Wignall, an economist and the Special Advisor to the Secretary-General on Financial Markets at the OECD. He is also Director in the OECD's Directorate for Financial and Enterprise Affairs.  He was previously Head of Research at the Reserve Bank of Australia and has also held senior posts at an Australian asset management firm.  Trust-less exchange technology  The paper lauds cryptocurrencies' ability to conduct transfers using decentralised technology without the need for middle-men or trusted third parties. It cites a Goldman Sachs report comparing the Coinbase fee of 1% for transactions against fees of up to 8.9% for money transfers.  Cryptocurrencies, it argues, could therefore reduce transaction costs for credit card spending, e-commerce and money transfers.  Blundell-Wignall also describes the Ripple protocol as a potentially superior trust-less transaction mechanism to bitcoin. According to the paper, Ripple wouldn't require the ""increasingly computer intensive and costly"" mining associated with bitcoin. However, it would still produce reduced transaction costs and speedier transfers.  The paper, therefore, calls for policymakers to embrace cryptocurrency technologies:  ""Policymakers should welcome the exploration of the use of new technology to improve efficiency and provide competition to high-cost incumbent intermediaries in the financial system.""  Not a currency  However, Blundell-Wignall draws a sharp distinction between the bitcoin protocol and the technology underlying digital currencies in general, and bitcoin as a currency. According to him, cryptocurrency will never be accepted as legal tender due to government monopolies on taxes.  He describes how all entities in a state have to pay taxes, thus requiring all banks to be able to clear their payments with the government's bank, which is often the central bank. Because the central bank will only accept legal tender, though, cryptocurrency will not be accepted, and the government has no reason to classify it as legal tender.  Blundell-Wignall writes:  ""No matter how acceptable bitcoins are amongst its enthusiasts, it can in no way impact the ability of the government to conduct monetary policy because everyone at the end of the day has to pay their taxes and must obtain central bank liabilities to clear with the central bank.""  Risky business  The OECD paper goes into detail on the risks associated with bitcoin and anonymous fund transfers. Among these are tax evasion, money laundering and the lack of consumer protection.  Blundell-Wignall paints a picture of how a government could intervene heavily in the bitcoin system if it were used for illegal activities with the example of the abandonment of the gold standard in the 1930s. The US government then used its ""plenary power"" to cancel all gold clauses in public and private contracts, freeing itself from the gold standard.  Something similar could happen with bitcoin, Blundell-Wignall argues:  ""If bitcoins begin to undermine the financial and tax systems they will be shut down and all contracts between traders would be unenforceable.""  About the OECD  The OECD's working papers do not represent the official views of the organisation. Instead, they are research works in progress that represent the opinions of the authors.  Working papers are designed to ""stimulate discussion"" on the range of issues that fall within the OECD's remit, according to the organisation's literature. Working papers are also open to comments. The bitcoin paper is part of the OECD's series of working papers on finance, insurance and private pensions.  The OECD is an international organisation headquartered in Paris. It was established in 1948, as the Organisation for European Economic Cooperation, to administer the Marshall Plan for the reconstruction of Europe following the second world war.  Today, it is an influential policy research organisation that advises the governments of its 34 member states on economic and social policies.

42425801,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgN5h,1403791886,Government Sale of Bitcoin Establishes Fungibility Precedent,"The US Marshals Service (USMS) will auction off the bitcoin seized from Silk Road to the highest bidder tomorrow. It amounts to 29,656.51 BTC contained in wallet files residing on Silk Road servers.  In total, there will be nine blocks of 3,000 bitcoin and one block of around 2,656 bitcoin offered in the auction, representing the amount stated in the forfeiture order by the court on 15th January, 2014.  Although the authorities hold more coins, the auction does not include the approximate 140,000 BTC contained in wallet files that resided on computer hardware belonging to Ross William Ulbricht that were seized on 24th October, 2013 and are known as ""DPR SEIZED COINS"".  Establishing equivalent value  Regardless of the morality of pre-trial asset forfeiture, the sale via auction of approximately $17 million worth of bitcoin by the USMS will establish the first governmental precedent for bitcoin fungibility, which could become significant for future bitcoin-related cases involving 'blacklisting', or 'tainted bitcoin'.  Fungibility refers to the concept that every unit or sub-unit remains equivalent and identical to any other unit or sub-unit. It is the property of a good or commodity in which individual units are capable of mutual substitution.  Blacklisting and the notion of tainted bitcoins refers to the concept that certain bitcoins may be treated different due to their origin and/or usage, thereby resulting in a valuation differential.  Each bitcoin sold in the government's auction is made without representation and also without any disclaimer or restrictions on their subsequent usage and transfer within the bitcoin block chain.  In additional clarifying statements, the auction notice says:    ""The USMS will not answer any questions regarding (a) the associated criminal or civil cases that resulted in the seizure of the bitcoins being auctioned, (b) Bitcoin characteristics, uses or value, or (c) specifics of the auction process other than information provided in these documents;      The USMS will not sell to any person who is acting on behalf of or in concert with the Silk Road and/or Ross William Ulbricht, and bidders will be required to so certify;    The USMS will not transfer bitcoins to an obscene public address, a public address apparently in a country restricted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), a public address apparently associated with terrorism, other criminal activities, or otherwise hostile to the United States;    The winning bidder will receive a signed Bill of Sale from the United States Marshals Service prior to the transfer of the bitcoins.""    A bitcoin is a bitcoin  None of these statements carry any indication that the USMS or the Department of Justice view these coins to be 'legally different' or 'subject to special treatment' by exchanges and market participants. Conversely, the USMS is attempting to maximize its return of the sale of these bitcoin assets by specifically not disrupting their implied fungibility.  No special discounts apply to the sale and if they are bulk discounted by virtue of the wholesale bidding process, it would neither be due to the source of the bitcoin assets nor their alleged use on the Silk Road for various transactions.  [post-quote]  Furthermore, there is no intent to blacklist or whitelist the coins for subsequent circulation, because this would negatively impact the valuation at auction. All bitcoins obtained from the auction sale process are able to be freely transferred and circulated around the world.  An interesting Scottish monetary case from the 1700s suggests that blacklisting or mandatory coin validation is a misguided premise. Fortunately, in that particular case, the judges upheld the principle of unrestricted fungibility.  The auctioned bitcoin are theoretically being sold at par to other circulating bitcoin. In the future, governments or free markets may determine that certain bitcoin addresses carry a taint or don't trade at par for some reason, but, for now, a legally-orchestrated sale of bitcoin assets demonstrates that a bitcoin is a bitcoin is a bitcoin.  Market role  As covered on Bloomberg TV, SecondMarket's Barry Silbert even organized a bidding syndicate to allow smaller investors the opportunity to obtain bitcoin at favorable bulk pricing, where 10% of any auction fees received by SecondMarket will be donated to the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  While the government's actions and announcements regarding bitcoin fungibility play a critical role in setting expectations for the market, the globally distributed bitcoin network spans many jurisdictions and true fungibility is ultimately determined by what the market will bear. Not all market participants have to adhere to fungibility determinations in the same way.

42425806,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgNFh,1403789594,"Anonibet Talks Bitcoin Foundation Membership, World Cup Contest","Anonibet has become the latest gold member of the Bitcoin Foundation. The bitcoin bet shop is currently in the middle of its World Cup 2014 contest, with a total of 22 BTC up for grabs.  Anonibet  has been around since 2011 and it has the distinction of being the first bitcoin sportbook and casino. It offers user the opportunity to bet on a wide range of sports, from basketball and football to snooker and beach volley.  With its latest World Cup 2014 contest and its recent decision to support the Bitcoin Foundation, Anonibet is hoping to attract new users and engage existing customers too.  Anonibet’s World Cup 2014 Contest  Anonibet first announced its World Cup 2014 Contest last month –setting aside 22 BTC in prizes, no strings attached.  According to the site, a skilled player can walk away with up to 10 BTC. However, since the Cup itself turned into a roller-coaster ride even before the group stage was over, users will inevitably require more luck than skill.  In any case, the promotion was good for business, as Anonibet’s Michael Hoshford explains:  “The World Cup is the most important sport event for all sportsbooks. The World Cup lasts a month and it offers much more matches than any other competition.""  The company claims its total prize of 22 BTC is so far the highest guaranteed prize of any sportsbook, whether it be bitcoin accepting or not.  Anonibet says it experienced a “very positive reaction” since its prizes are guaranteed and there is no fine print. Each winner will be able to withdraw their prize without having to place any bets and Anonibet told CoinDesk that the concept has already attracted a number of new users keen to adopt bitcoin just to take part in the contest.  Supporting the Bitcoin Foundation  But why has the company decided to formally support the Bitcoin Foundation at this time? Hoshford responded that he simply wants to see the foundation bridge the gap between bitcoin and established financial institutions and regulators:  “Since bitcoin is not backed by a bank or government, there is no 'official' body to answer questions coming from governments or any other institutions. The foundation’s role is very important to fill this gap.”  “We are strong believers in bitcoin and we think that it is on the verge [of going] mainstream in the coming 1-2 years, so that is why now is the perfect time to back the foundation,” he added.  Although details remain sketchy, Hoshford also used the opportunity to announce new features coming to the platform soon. “Our next product release will be a live dealer casino,” he said.  While Anonibet claims to have the highest prize, it is not the only service offering World Cup betting. We took a close look at World Cup bitcoin betting offers in our roundup earlier this month.

42425813,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgNLh,1403782894,Middle East Investment Bank: Bitcoin Could Ignite Regional E-Commerce,"Kuwait-based investment banking and asset management firm Kuwait Financial Centre, also known as Markaz, has published a new report on bitcoin in which it heralds digital currency as a disruptive technology that could help ignite the region's e-commerce industry.  Entitled 'Disruptive Technology: Bitcoins, Currency Reinvented?', the 20-page report provides a broad introduction to bitcoin, while highlighting the opportunity it presents to investors in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and its member countries Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).  Markaz  examines bitcoin's strengths and weaknesses, the differing stances of global regulators and the details of the Mt. Gox collapse, but its overall takeaway is encouraging for both the Middle East's local bitcoin operators and for the wider digital currency industry.  The report concludes that, despite the risks, the benefits bitcoin could bring to the region should not be overlooked by Middle Eastern investors. It reads:  ""If properly nurtured, this technology can help e-commerce take off in a big way. Micropayment and cashless payment technologies would make it easier for people to carry just their smartphone and pay for it.""  Markaz also noted that bitcoin may be uniquely suited to the needs of the Middle East given its high smartphone penetration – 50% of its mobile phones are smartphones – and comparatively youthful demographic, writing:  ""Bitcoin initially is hard to comprehend, however, GCC nations have a majority of younger population [sic] who are in their 20s and educating them is much easier. Social media forums show that it is people from this age group who actively participate in bitcoin related threads.""  The report follows bitcoin's appearance at Dubai's recent ArabNet Digital Summit 2014. There, local entrepreneurs from bitcoin startups Yellow and Umbrellab introduced new members of the region's tech community to the technology.  Investment opportunities limited  Investors in North America and Europe are currently capitalizing on an increasingly varied field of bitcoin startups for investment. However, Markaz noted that GCC investors have fewer local options and will have to take on more risk to achieve gains or turn to international services.  Markaz concluded that angel investment is now the best, if only, regional option for GCC investors. As such, it stated that those interested should approach with caution:  ""Investors however should conduct their own due diligence in ventures before investing as they are risky investments. Bitcoin, still being in an experimental phase, has an 80% probability of going to zero, as the value of bitcoin is basically driven by people’s acceptance.""  More immediate obstacles are presented by the lack of development in the MENA startup scene. The report notes ""there are no GCC-based bitcoin exchanges"", but does provide a section on how to open a bitcoin exchange that covers the basics of digital currency exchange trading.  For now, the report directs investors to international investments such as the Bitcoin Investment Trust. Lead by CEO Barry Silbert, it lauded the investment vehicle for allowing investors to gain ""exposure to the price movement of bitcoin without the risks of direct bitcoin ownerships such as buying, storing and safekeeping bitcoins"".  Bitcoin could improve oil trade  One of the more interesting findings in the report may be its conclusion that bitcoin could be used to help generate savings for oil exporters. The industry currently accounts for 90% of GCC exports and 75% of government revenue, according to Markaz, but also must deal with the costs of receiving payments from all over the world.  Specifically, it suggests bitcoin could be used to reduce the clearing time for international payments, which it says currently take between one and three days to process.  The report envisions a wide range of potential uses for bitcoin technology to improve the region's oil trade, stating:  ""Revamping the payment system in line with bitcoin systems will yield in savings in terms of cost, time and paperwork involved. Alternatively the same payment method could be adopted for fund transfers among the GCC regions as well as the whole of [the] Middle East.""  Tread with caution  Markaz also examined the road ahead for bitcoin, suggesting that informed industry observers believe it could be 10 years before the Middle East is significantly affected by bitcoin technology.  Bitcoin, Markaz concluded, has ""a long way to go"" to catch up to the transaction volumes of Visa and MasterCard, citing Coinmetrics data that places bitcoin's daily transaction volume at $89m.  Potential roadblocks to the ultimate realization of bitcoin as a currency and system of payment, the report said, are most likely to come from conservative governments – which will wait for other jurisdictions to take the lead on lawmaking – and an overall lack of acceptance.  As a result, Markaz warns that bitcoin presents a high-risk investment opportunity:  ""Bitcoin rests on the foundation of people’s acceptance. If acceptance does not gain widespread traction, bitcoin might vanish into internet’s oblivion.""  To learn more, view the complete report.

42425816,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgNTh,1403779411,Western Union Open to Bitcoin 'If Regulated as Currency',"Western Union CEO Hikmet Ersek has said his company is open to the idea of using bitcoin, but only once the digital currency is fully regulated.  In an interview with Bloomberg TV, Ersek discussed how the company deals with security concerns and its role as a global jobs creator. However, the bitcoin bombshell is what makes the interview most interesting for cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors.  Regulation vital  When asked about the potential threat coming from bitcoin, which offers a far cheaper way to move value around the globe, especially considering Western Union's ""expensive"" pricing, Ersek argued that, if the service was too expensive, customers wouldn't use it.  He then pointed out that Western Union already offers the ability to move 121 different national currencies, and that, notably, bitcoin could become one of them, but only if it is properly regulated:  “Once bitcoin should be regulated by the regulator as a proper currency, why should we not also use bitcoin?""  We would use it ""if it is regulated as a currency, but it is not regulated as a currency,"" he emphasised, adding:    ""That’s the issue with bitcoin. We are a very regulated industry. If bitcoin is regulated and the customer wants that, I mean, why not? [...]      I am not sure bitcoin is a currency. Bitcoin is a system. It is not used as a currency, it is defined as an asset. When the reserve bank issues bitcoin and when it is regulated we would be more than happy.”    While it may seem promising that the company would consider adopting the digital currency in its portfolio, the fact remains that bitcoin is unregulated in most countries and is not anywhere considered a currency.  So, Ersek’s statement pretty much shuts the door on bitcoin in its current form. However, it does, perhaps, open another for regulated digital currencies backed by the traditional finance industry.  Cryptocurrency criticisms  Earlier this year Ersek criticised digital currencies as a First-World phenomenon with limited practicalities on the receiver-side, which is crucial to Western Union’s business model.  In addition, Western Union made its formal position on digital currencies clear last year.  Speaking at the 2013 Consumer Protection & Compliance Conference last October, executives from the company concluded that bitcoin is not ready for international money transfers yet, due to a number of potential issues.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/26/western-union-open-to-bitcoin-if-regulated-as-currency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/118e1d42fbc4482666727c88ef3d189deb858a5b-1024x517.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
