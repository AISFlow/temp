From daring entrepreneurs and builders, to inspired thinkers and communicators, this space has no shortage of colorful characters pushing the envelope.      It’s in this spirit that we present this year’s Most Influential, a selection of people who did exceptional things in 2019. Whether it was Caitlin Long establishing Wyoming as the “blockchain state,” or Rune Christensen corralling MakerDAO, or David Marcus launching Libra, these people made an impact and shaped the conversation, for better or for worse.      The selection (click here) was made in a three-step process. First, CoinDesk staff drew up a long-list. Then, we asked readers to vote for their favorites in a survey. Then, based on all opinions, CoinDesk made a final choice.      Note: People are chosen for having exemplary years, perhaps the most significant year of their careers. This is not an all-time influencer list. Some well-known OGs were not included, even though they are obviously important (before the #xrparmy starts asking about Brad Garlinghouse).      For instance, Jack Dorsey made the cut this year not only for championing bitcoin in Silicon Valley, but funding a development team to work on its core protocol. Gerald Cotten, of Quadriga infamy, helped us learn (again) the truth of the old adage: “not your keys, not your coins.”      Whatever your views of this selection, we hope you enjoy the discussion it is likely to spark.

Trent Larson is a software developer in the blockchain industry. These opinions are his and do not necessarily reflect the views of his employer or family. (However, there are many humans who do share these opinions.)      2019 was the year of The Patient Builder and The Persistent Bully.      After the exuberance of 2017 with bitcoins selling for nearly $20,000, businesses and ICOs came out of the woodwork in 2018, playing on every kind of emotion, and most of these died of natural causes: those with bad plans couldn’t sustain, and those with bad intent exploited anyone with a get-rich-quick mindset. We learned lessons from the good, the bad and the ugly.      2019 continued the crypto winter, and that brought initiatives from The Patient Builders for the new monetary infrastructure – and for the foundation of all our digital lives. Central authority is getting the black eye it deserves, where large organizations are tremendously efficient, but data and identity theft exposes inherent vulnerabilities in those systems. We're shifting security and power toward the edges of the network where it belongs (with the people).      There are some foundational technologies that are maturing (for example, zero-knowledge proofs, the lightning network, and formally verifiable security and processes). But, even though I started as a developer, I'm most excited about seeing the real world benefits of bitcoin’s tech: digital securities trading, blockchain-enabled supply-chain adoption, and utility bills being paid. Governments are seeing use-cases as well: blockchain-based voting is expanding, widespread land records have been recorded, and companies are even paying taxes in bitcoin.      This maturing process is prompting better security and practices across all industries, as shown by SIM hacks that will force cell providers to harden their procedures.      Many of these use-cases were envisioned in the early days, but it's fun to see how different types of blockchains and other cryptographic tools are used. There are many ways to combine blockchain fundamentals (for example, “smart” workflows, PKI and network sustainability) to support incentives for sustainable networks with truly democratic governance. In 2020, I see these creative combinations as our main work: some of our solutions will explicitly involve blockchains but many are blockchain-less innovations that empower people in other ways.      2019 has also highlighted the insidiousness of The Persistent Bully, particularly incumbents. Some are trying to outlaw any cryptocurrency usage, but even in states with democratic principles, politicians with a command-and-control mindset know they don't need to outlaw everything. They only need to find one of the many bureaus that have any kind of claim for regulation, and actually they don’t need to act, because the threats and the uncertainty make the risk prohibitive. In the US, this is mainly aimed at business and banks. Banks are always assessing risk, but the fear of audits pushes them to simply deny services, resulting in bank accounts remaining a problem in our space. This is happening with multiple jurisdictions at multiple levels, as states are using money transmitter laws in new ways. Thankfully, governments like Wyoming and Barbados are actively looking ahead to enable our industry; however, it’s a sad state when allowed activities need to be spelled out.      Here's where the creator in me comes out: secure, privately-owned digital assets enable new businesses and transaction types, and everyone who starts coding – down to elementary students – should be able to gain exposure to these tools. Consider what boon micro-payments would be to many industries. However, the IRS claims all these transactions are taxable, and even swaps between currencies are taxable events. Think about how this scares away many who simply want to dabble in this technology, much more to experiment and build with it.      Recently, I worked with an executive of a cryptocurrency company that actually delivered a mobile wallet. He didn't hold multiple cryptocurrencies, only bitcoin. I enjoy helping people use tokens of different kinds, walking them through the process and security implications. He declined to try out any others. Why? Because he – an executive in our industry -- wasn't sure of the legal difficulties, even if it were for a few pennies worth.      Let that sink in.      Leviathan is now real. In the name of “safety,” politicians and bureaucrats have gone way too far with prosecution of victimless crimes; if you are one of them, please stop the persecution, and allow innovation to solve societal problems. Some people are accepting “safety at all costs,” but please allow small breaks so we can avoid large-scale manipulation; if you're a citizen, the best defense is widespread approval and adoption, despite the threats. I encourage builders everywhere to follow Netki's call to NOT recreate the traditional banking world. Let’s figure out how to restrict the growth of totalitarianism: let’s shackle the reach of the state, rather than the power of the people.      Bitcoin turned 10 this year, living through a decade of optimists and overlords; next comes slower growth and tests of the long-term value propositions. Here's to even more growth and creativity with trust and incentive models, with or without chains attached.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Trent Larson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2019/12/18/the-year-of-the-patient-builder-and-the-persistent-bully,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e8faced7e810e24f3c646bcb738fe59b1b3e5249-1304x846.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431309,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1Xph,1576695600,"It's Not Just the Money, It's the People in Bitcoin: Anil Lulla","This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Anil Lulla is a co-founder of Delphi Digital, a research and consulting boutique specializing in digital assets.      Anil Lulla co-founded Delphi Digital in mid-2018 with four friends he met while working at Bloomberg and Deutsche Bank. Their idea: to provide credible, actionable research for an industry populated by noisy clout-chasers and ensnaring scammers.      “When I left my job, my managing director literally didn’t understand why I was leaving for fake internet money,” Lulla said. In a way, this goodbye proved his thesis – that there wasn’t anything anyone could point to to explain the value proposition of bitcoin, he said.      “While I personally buy into the crypto ethos, we’re not selling anarchist thoughts, just offering perspective on why should you pay attention: because crypto is a great investment opportunity.”      More than a year later, Lulla reflects on the intricacies of the market, how a background analyzing distressed debt can help one understand the token industry, and why crypto will always be infinitely more interesting than “real money.”      Has this past year’s cycle – from bust to boom to bust – revealed anything new about how BTC operates?      This cycle has been interesting to see from a crypto fund perspective, which use bitcoin as both an investment and beta. We saw the thesis of bitcoin’s market supremacy play out in real time in the first two quarters, as bitcoin continued to get all the attention and alt-bagholders saw their satoshis disappear. The headlines and investment interest flowing back in proves the reflexivity of the market. It’s also interesting to consider over the past 12 months where every incremental dollar was added in the market. While some was new money, most was sitting on the sidelines from people who had sold their positions and were waiting to come back in.      What’s the deal with technical analysis? What does it actually tell you, if anything?      At Delphi, we don’t use TA as much as fundamentals, though we’ve added a little more because it's a trader’s market. If it can help execute trades accurately 60 percent of the time, it’s worth it. But we think bitcoin’s real advantages over traditional assets for market analysis is on-chain indicators. My partner Yan led our UTXO analysis which was used to call the bottom of the market by looking at HODL waves, or when certain massive hodlers start selling. It’s a way to help predict when people will take cash off the table based on their potential returns and selling pressure.      How has the addition of institutional holders affected bitcoin?      It’s a slow change, but we think Bakkt and Fidelity will be huge for the market long term. My team laughed at the focus given to Bakkt’s launch, and the reaction once it didn’t move the needle the first week. The benefit of these products isn’t from short term inflows of capital, but that credible brands are making long-term investments because they view crypto as a long-term project. This allows traditional investors to take risks they wouldn’t otherwise with the latest crypto unicorn.    The amount of capital coming in also includes human capital.    Does Delphi get any crossover from traditional finance?      Whenever you have volatility in the market, we have people crossing over from that side of the market. They may not actually be interested in making an allocation, but funds may have clients who see bitcoin spike and ask them why they are not allocated to that asset, or at least wonder what’s going on. Most conversations revolve around bitcoin. At a macro view, a lot of the people who look at the market seriously are starting to understand the value proposition of bitcoin beyond being a store of value.      If 2019 was year of bitcoin, where does that leave tokens or ICO projects for 2020?      Next year will see a lot of “layer ones” launching. But, the reality is a lot of token projects need help figuring out their economic or governance structures. Meanwhile, a lot of the projects that raised during the 2017 craze have essentially become distressed assets. That doesn’t necessarily mean they’re dead projects. One of crypto’s biggest value propositions is how quickly developments can happen. Maybe the biggest is changes on ethereum. We weren’t even aware of the real efficiency gains of Optimistic Rollups until Vitalik published a blog post. These things come from long periods of hard work and then, to the general public, they seem to come out of nowhere.      Sometimes I cringe at comparisons between crypto and the early days of e-commerce, just because of the investment activity. In the 90s, every website was an iteration of the same basic website, but with crypto it’s a constant evolution.      The amount of capital coming in also includes human capital. It’s amazing to see what people are creating. The easiest way to talk about crypto is that it’s dis-intermediating middlemen while organizing or incentivizing groups to work together. Instadapp. Uniswap. The composability between projects is incredible. Things like that are why I think this sector will ultimately produce things that are valuable and give mainstream audience no choice but to participate.

According to a press release issued Wednesday, the SEC intends to add a list of new qualifications to become an accredited investor. At present, accredited investors are defined as individuals with more than $1 million in net worth (or who earn more than $200,000 per year), an organization with more than $5 million in assets, banks and institutions which meet certain legal definitions or entities that match certain other restricted terms.      Being an accredited investor allows entities and individuals access to a greater number of private investments, including riskier investments and hedge funds, according to Bloomberg.      Under the SEC amendment, the term would expand to include new categories of ""natural persons,"" individuals who qualify as ""knowledgeable employees"" of certain private funds, companies which meet certain restrictions, entities which ""own 'investments'"" defined under the Investment Company Act, family offices with a minimum of $5 million in assets, and spousal equivalents who can pool finances to qualify.      The SEC published a concept paper earlier this year with other suggestions on expanding the definition. The document noted that past suggestions included a knowledge-based test to determine whether an individual could become an accredited investor.      According to Wednesday's release, the proposed amendment would ""more effectively identify institutional and individual investors that have the knowledge and expertise to participate"" in private capital markets.      SEC Chairman Jay Clayton explained in a statement that the existing definition only provides ""a binary approach"" to who does or does not qualify for the status.      “Modernization of this approach is long overdue,"" he said. ""The proposal would add additional means for individuals to qualify to participate in our private capital markets based on established, clear measures of financial sophistication.”      Clayton noted that the amendment would also recognize Native American governments as entities which should have access to U.S. capital markets.

The move, announced Wednesday, comes after the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued updated guidance for calculating taxes on cryptocurrencies in October. The last time the IRS issued such guidance was in 2014, when the crypto market was less complex and fewer taxpayers held the assets.      “One of the first questions on the IRS’s tax form is whether you have crypto assets,” Lukka CEO Jake Benson told CoinDesk. “It is a question that taxpayers cannot ignore anymore.”      Retail investors can submit transaction records from crypto exchanges to online accounts on the firm’s website. The software will reconcile the transaction data and calculate how much in taxes the investors will pay, which will be recognized by the IRS, according to Benson.      Lukka has also established a partnership with CPA.com, a subsidiary of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, to offer crypto tax preparation services for professional accounting firms, Benson said.      He said the partnership is significant since the institute only selects one partner in each industry to provide accounting guidance and services.

Transcript:      Adam B. Levine: On Today’s episode, we’re talking crypto market downdrafts, Decentralized, or Blockchain Application usage, and Canaan’s post-IPO blues. It’s December 18, 2019, and you’re listening to Markets Daily, I’m Adam B. Levine, editor of Podcasts here At Coindesk, along with our senior markets reporter, Brad Keoun, to give you a concise daily briefing on crypto markets and some of the most important news developments in the sector over the past 24 hours. And now, we start with Brad for the daily bitcoin market briefing, before turning to the rest of the news. Brad: Bitcoin price has fallen in all but two of the last 10 trading days and it’s currently around $6600 CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole reports that bitcoin's price chart is sending a bearish signal, and there's a risk price could fall toward or even below a 7-month low around $6500. And this downdraft in crypto markets has crushed some investors hope for altcoins in 2019, with ether recently slipping into negative territory, now down 15% year-to-date, and XRP from Ripple, which is the third-biggest cryptocurrency by market value, down 51% Turning to the news, the crypto-focused firm Circle is narrowing its focus again after several strategic cuts and business moves this year. The company on Tuesday announced the sale of its already-shrunken over-the-counter trading desk to the San Francisco-based exchange Kraken, and said a few high-ranking executives would be stepping down Circle now will focus on the development and growth of its stablecoin business, anchored around its dollar-pegged coin, which trades under the ticker USDC. The announcement follows Circle’s sale of the Poloniex trading platform in October. In September, Circle exited the cryptocurrency research business. Kraken, for its part, said its over-the-counter trading desk will now have about 20 employees, allowing the company to serve new trading partners in Asia. The crypto exchange ErisX has gone live with its physically-settled bitcoin futures contract, aiming to take on the Intercontinental Exchange’s Bakkt crypto offshoot, which has targeted institutional investors with the new type of futures contract. These physically-settled futures contracts allow hedgers to deliver bitcoin to settle a trade when the futures contract expires. Contrast this with cash-settled futures contracts where traders merely exchange money to true up. Cash-settled futures have been trading on the CME in the U.S. since 2017       Kaspersky, the Russian cybersecurity and anti-virus company, says there’s been a decline this year in what are known as crypto-mining attacks. This is when hackers are able to implant software on an unsuspecting user’s computer and then use that software to mine cryptocurrencies without the user even knowing. A security analyst for Kaspersky said that hackers appear to be finding more profitable opportunities through other types of attacks, including ransomware.      And finally, CoinDesk’s Paddy Baker reports that the Taiwanese phone manufacturer HTC confirmed this week that it would ax jobs to remain competitive and better focus on a handful of high-end products, including its blockchain phone, EXODUS. HTC has slashed more than half of its workforce in recent years, but the EXODUS phones are now getting pushed to the top of the priority list. First unveiled in May 2018, HTC’s EXODUS phones can connect to decentralized networks and allow users to download and run decentralized applications in much the same way as conventional apps run on smartphones. The phone doubles as a hardware wallet, providing owners with a secure and mobile means to hold their cryptocurrencies.      Adam: For today's featured story, we’d like to welcome Christine Kim, a research analyst here at CoinDesk for a look at usage for some of the most exciting, or at least most hyped projects on the blockchain.      Christine Kim: Thanks Adam. The blockchain industry outside of bitcoin is about more than just digital payments. It’s also about decentralized applications or dapps. Today, I want to take a deep dive into the dapp ecosystem and give you a sense of its growth, or lack thereof, in 2019.      You may not have heard very much about dapps since the CryptoKitties craze of 2017.      Adam: So, what’s the CryptoKitties craze?      Christine: Well, in short, there was one dapp called CryptoKitties that infamously clogged the ethereum blockchain in December 2017. To give you a sense of its popularity, the volume of unconfirmed transactions increased six-fold in the matter of just one week because of this dapp. Users of the ethereum blockchain were up in arms saying the ethereum blockchain was essentially frozen because of these new ""feline overlords.""      So, that’s one example of dapp adoption going viral and having some negative unforeseen consequences on the blockchain.      And while there have been similarly popular dapp games on ethereum like Gods Unchained since Crypto Kitties, we’re not seeing a spike in usage or number of dapps like we did last year.      To put things in perspective, the number of new dapps created per month has decreased from roughly 160 back in September of 2018 to now only 70. That’s an over 50 percent drop in the number of new dapps created each month across 10 different smart contract blockchain platform, according to blockchain analytics site StateoftheDapps.      Adam: What do you think accounts for that decline?      Christine: It could be a number of factors but I think the main one has to do with the overall crypto bear market we’re only now slowly fighting our way out of. Back in late 2017 to 2018, we saw a surge in market demand for cryptocurrencies. The world’s second-largest by market capitalization, ethereum, reach an all time high in January 2018 of nearly $1,400 U.S. that of course helped bolster the dapp ecosystem ethereum was built to support. This year market interest in ethereum wasn’t so hot and pricing for the asset reflected as much. Right now, ethereum is about $140. Whoever said crypto was a safe bet, eh?      Adam: But what about DeFi? Wasn’t that a major narrative of 2019?      Christine: Good point. Decentralized finance or DeFi was indeed a major narrative of 2019. MakerDAO in particular truly kick-started an entire new category of dapps on the ethereum blockchain to emerge. As background on this topic, DeFi is category of dapps focussed on decentralized ways to replace traditional financial services. However, it’s still a very nascent industry. Despite it’s real growth this year in terms of users and numbers, it still remains the second most popular type of dapp across blockchain platforms today. The most popular remains projects focused on gambling. But for everything else? It’s anybody's game.            Adam: And now, for our Spotlight segment, we’re looking at the stock-price action at Kay-nin Canaan, a Chinese maker of computers used to mine cryptocurrencies, since the company’s IPO last month. And spoiler alert - it isn’t pretty      Brad: That’s right, Adam, Canaan is one of the world’s biggest makers of computers used to mine cryptocurrencies, though its sales are far behind the industry’s biggest player, Bitmain, which is also based in China. Even so, last month Canaan took the bold step of selling shares publicly in the U.S. through an initial public offering. The company sold about $90 million of its shares, valuing the overall company at about $1.3 billion.      But in hindsight, the timing of the IPO looks terrible - for investors, that is.      Since the IPO, the price has declined in all but four of the first 17 trading sessions since the IPO, including a 35 percent drop just since the start of last week.      Now there appear to be several factors driving this decline in the stock prices, and the anemic market we’re seeing in bitcoin is certainly one of those. Industry executives say the manufacturers of the computers, known as mining rigs, are suffering from a lack of orders as users await clues on whether bitcoin prices will head back up       With that as the backdrop, the manufacturers are suffering from an inventory backlog, and Bitmain, in particular, has taken the offensive on several aggressive sales measures, including price cuts on top models, limited bitcoin-price guarantees and even rental options. Another problem might just be that Canaan is falling behind in the technological arms race in this fast-moving industry. Canaan has scheduled the release of its next-generation rig, the AvalonMiner 11 series, for early next year. But that machine is expected to be less power-efficient than the Bitmain S17+ model, which is already out.      Canaan is controlled by its 36-year-old CEO, who goes by the nickname “Pumpkin."" At the time of the IPO, his stake in the company was valued at more than $200 million. But due to the falling stock price, that’s now been cut by almost $100 million.      There was a warning sign ahead of the IPO, when the big investment bank Credit Suisse dropped off the underwriting team, and Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter, then the Swiss firm was worried about whether investor demand for the shares would be sufficient.      Matt D’Souza, co-founder and CEO of Blockware Solutions, which brokers mining-rig purchases, says he thinks Canaan is in a tough position. With the company’s sales on the decline, it apparently needs cash to accelerate the development of its next generation of mining rigs and try to stay competitive with Bitmain",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,"Adam B.

42431306,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1Xhh,1576690200,"A Year of Careful, Prosaic BUIDLing","This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Brian Behlendorf is the Executive Director of Hyperledger, an open source group advancing cross-industry blockchain technology.      2019 has been a year of growth and maturity in the use of blockchain technology for real business needs. Even the term “blockchain” is mostly out of favor, never fully shaking its association with get-rich-quick schemes and behavioral engineering, and now avoided by anyone trying to get upper-management support for their work, in favor of “distributed ledgers” and “smart contract systems.”      Long gone are the days when an iced tea company could get a stock boost using the B word. Instead, this was a year of more prosaic BUIDLing, with announcements of production systems and value being created, punctuated by headlines showing policymakers and CEOs more broadly understanding and wrestling with the transformative impact the technology is starting to have. And, on the ground, there’s nothing like lean times to sharpen developer attention on common code and common cause and getting things done.      Each day, this publication and others brought headlines of further enterprise adoption: from the IBM Food Trust Network’s successes with Walmart and Carrefour; to Volvo, VW and Ford tracing rare-earth minerals for electric car batteries; to the government of British Columbia’s use of blockchain-based self-sovereign identity for business registrations; to Lamborghini providing the “now lambo” answer everyone’s been asking since 2013. In the financial markets, not only did JPMorgan make a big statement with its launch of JPMCoin, the national Bank of Cambodia beat every central bank in the world to the punch by deploying a blockchain-based payments network.      It’s been fashionable to ding enterprise blockchain projects this year, but even the stodgy old world press has noticed the efforts paying off, both for companies that defined “enterprise” and hard working startups.      Ironically for a technology entirely about decentralization, the two biggest institutions of their kind this year made announcements about blockchain initiatives that, between them, caused every boardroom and government policymaking office to take notice. The first, of course, was Facebook’s launch of the Libra initiative. Libra’s design would not have appeared technically feasible before the rise of both public and permissioned blockchains, which have helped establish both the architectural basics but also corporate acceptance of the DLT concept.      Its major mistake was that Facebook marketed it initially as a Facebook-driven project, rather than as a consortium of companies. Blockchain is a team sport – the strength of all these projects lie in the community of companies pulling together around a common set of needs. Had Facebook taken a step back, and let the Libra Association establish its leadership of the project and walk the public through its objectives, it might have avoided much of the pushback. All this highlights the importance of governance on blockchain networks as well. I predict we will see Libra come back in 2020, with a running network, perhaps even in production, with the Calibra client from Facebook and maybe others. But it’ll only work if they embrace the crowd as a (large!) peer rather than try to own the crowd. And when they do, they may find a lot of competition for cross-border currencies.      The second big announcement this year was Xi Xinping’s declaration that China should “seize the opportunity” of blockchain technology – and very pointedly, with a digital yuan instead of bitcoin. China has been a hotbed of blockchain activity for the last few years – and not just regarding crypto mining hardware. The People’s Bank of China has grown its blockchain trade finance network to over 40 Chinese banks, processing over a billion RMB of letters of credit daily. Walmart has been active in China too, deploying a blockchain system for food traceability. The Internet Courts in Beijing and Guangzhou use blockchain tech to make evidence submitted electronically tamper-proof via a consortium set up by LegalXChain.    Xi’s declaration has now made this a matter of national competitiveness.    While other governments, such as Dubai and Holland, had launched blockchain initiatives, Xi’s declaration has now made this a matter of national competitiveness. This is a huge boost to the blockchain industry in China, everyone from Baidu, Tencent, Alibaba / Ant Financial and Huawei to a long list of startups. It also raised the concern that the China blockchain industry and technologies may diverge from those outside, whether because of US sanctions or China’s Great Firewall. Fortunately, we have not yet seen barriers emerge at Hyperledger; companies and developers in our community who hail from China are active, first-class participants in the community.      In 2020, all these trends – increased adoption by mainstream enterprises, plus the growing and legit startup space around this, with greater attention paid by policymakers and more informed awareness by regulators – will meet up with a technology landscape that is finally coming together. We can see this at the level of ledgers and smart contracts, where the two largest ecosystems (Hyperledger Fabric and the Ethereum ecosystem) are now working more closely. This is thanks in no small part to the launch of the Hyperledger Besu project, bringing a full Enterprise Ethereum client into the Hyperledger fold. We can also see this in digital identity, where the Decentralized Identifier (DID) specification is now standards-track at the W3C. Meanwhile different identity community efforts (Hyperledger Indy, the DIF, Sovrin, and others) are describing ever more coherently how they plug together and will be bringing better identity management and privacy controls to end users.      From here out, the basic business and technical questions – can this be used for real-world use cases?; can competing vendors cooperate on common code and standards? – will be considered more or less answered, with new questions about governance of blockchain networks and interoperability between them taking center stage. Building out the talent pool for blockchain developers and administrators, professionalizing the service provider space, and sorting out the real ROI from the feel-good cheerleading, will be themes for the coming year. We and our community certainly plan to do our part.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Brian Behlendorf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/18/a-year-of-careful-prosaic-buidling,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fc7b0416c4272d5ebca5b95ef7295546f44506fb-1200x843.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42431313,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1Xzh,1576689600,Bitcoin ‘UTXOs in Loss’ at Record Highs Amid Price Sell-Off,"A key metric is hovering at record highs, suggesting investors are likely holding bitcoins even when deep in the red.      The number of unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) in loss rose to all-time highs above $45 million on Dec. 17, representing a 578 percent rise from the July 1 figure of $6.69 million, according to on-chain market intelligence firm Glassnode.      A UTXO is basically leftover bitcoins after a transaction. It’s a little bit like getting back change when paying for something in cash using large bills.      For example, Alice has 10 bitcoins and needs to pay three BTC to Bob, a merchant. Alice can’t just send out three BTC and hold the rest. Instead, she will have to spend 10 BTC, of which three BTC will be sent to Bob and the remaining seven BTC will be sent back to the address she controls. These seven bitcoins are UTXOs and can be used as inputs in another transaction.      A loss-making UTXO is the one whose price at the time it was created was higher than the current price.      The fact that the UTXO-loss metric is hovering at record highs following a 50 percent price slide from June highs above $13,800 to recent lows near $6,500 indicates investors are likely holding on to their loss-making outputs, according to Alex Benfield, a crypto asset analyst at Digital Assets Data.      ""There have been 438 days where someone could have bought bitcoin and would currently be at a loss at the time of writing,"" Benfield told CoinDesk in an email. ""About half of these days took place in 2019 (dating back to May 12) and would represent short-term holders of less than one year. The other half dates back to as early as Nov. 3 of 2017 and are over two years old, representing long term-holders. Any bitcoin purchased during one of the days where the price was higher than it is today contributes to the UTXO-loss metric, which will continue to reach new all-time highs if the price continues to drop while buyers hold on to their bitcoin.""       Meanwhile, Yan Liberman, co-founder of research boutique Delphi Digital, said UTXO’s in loss can represent long-term holders and cited bitcoin’s market value to realize value (MVRV) ratio as a quicker way to gauge the amount of UTXOs in loss.      The MVRV ratio is calculated by dividing market value by realized value. While the market value is found by counting all mined coins equally at current market price, the realized value represents the sum of all coin values based on the last time they moved (sum of all UTXOs).      Thus, a falling ratio implies there are large amounts of UTXOs in loss, Liberman told CoinDesk. Bitcoin’s MVRV ratio currently stands at 1.23, having peaked at 2.38 in June, according to data source woobull.com.      Also, there is evidence that long-term holders haven’t been selling. The portion of supply held for at least 12 months started the year at 55.6 percent, peaked at the end of April at 60.8 percent, and sat at almost 59 percent at the end of November, according to Delphi Digital.      Further, the portion of supply held for more than two years stood at an all-time high of 40 percent at the end of November, having started the year at 34.6 percent.      All in all, there is strong reason to believe that “HOLDing” has driven the UTXO-loss metric to record highs.      The drop in the number of transactions seems to have played a role as well, according to Glassnode.      As shown in the chart above, the seven-day moving average of the on-chain transactions has declined from the high of 378,808 seen at the end of June to lows near 304,000. Fewer transactions mean fewer UTXOs have been created during the price slide.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/18/bitcoin-utxos-in-loss-at-record-highs-amid-price-sell-off,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8fe7a12acf25311fda14ffed9bdfb79dce9f1f30-1280x898.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421797,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXsGQn,1576688400,10 Things to Watch for in Crypto in 2020,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Galen Moore is a senior research analyst at CoinDesk Research, focused on developing metrics and analysis for crypto asset investors. Christine Kim is a research analyst for CoinDesk. She focusses on producing data-driven insights about the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry.  Things change fast in crypto. The only prediction that seems safe is that the narratives and metrics that seem important today will be eclipsed by new ideas, in a matter of months.  Nonetheless, on the cusp of a new year and a new decade, we will attempt a look ahead at the important events and issues to watch in 2020. We fully expect this research note to age poorly, but here at the end of 2019 is a list of what CoinDesk Research expects to be watching closely in the coming year.  1. The Halving  Sometime in May, bitcoin will go through a programmed halving of the block reward allotted to the miners who maintain the network on which it runs. This means miners who contribute computing power to the security of the network will receive half the number of bitcoins for each block of data they successfully record to bitcoin's blockchain. To what extent is bitcoin's price driven by supply-side economics? Are there predictable patterns of investment (and disillusionment) around the event itself? We hope to find out.  2. SEC vs. Telegram  Telegram, a messaging platform, became the second-largest initial coin offering (ICO) of 2018. Shares in the ICO were sold in the US under an SEC exemption, with shareholders expecting delivery of a crypto token, whenever Telegram’s blockchain-based network goes live. In 2019, the SEC sued to block that asset distribution and Telegram is fighting back. Don’t expect this one to end in 2020, but the twists and turns along the way will actively shape how developers and investors view their prospects for distribution and use of new coins and tokens.  3. Facebook’s Calibra launch  Will Facebook’s Libra project stick to its plan to launch a wallet to store and transfer the proposed stablecoin by June 2020? If it does, we’ll be watching closely for indicators to tell us whether Libra is fulfilling or falling short of its promise to bank the unbanked. And, we’ll hope to learn whether governments’ noted concerns over private currency issuance have basis in reality.  4. Recession and volatility  Since its founding, bitcoin has been tied to the idea that economic stimulus through monetary policy is a bad idea. With interest rates going negative in economies around the world, many bitcoiners seem to be watching the signs of impending global recession with something approaching glee. Bitcoin’s narrative tells us it’s “digital gold.” Therefore, it should act as a haven in times of economic downturn. Will it prove that story, or disprove it, or is it too early to tell? Global macro events and bitcoin markets’ reaction may tell us the answer.  5. US political parties  The year 2019 saw commentary on bitcoin from the White House and the US Federal Reserve. Facebook’s entry into crypto assets brought digital currencies before Congress. In the polarized US political landscape, it’s unlikely that a polarizing issue like crypto will be a bipartisan issue. Look out for pro- and no-coin election-year stances on party lines, as each side stakes out its ground.  6. Off-chain assets  In 2019, increasing use of the stablecoin Tether tilted transaction volume toward crypto assets backed by off-chain assets, such as dollars, rather than assets that derive their value from on-chain network effects or other as-yet undefined fundamentals. Was that a tipping point, or a blip? The question is crucial to the still-unanswered conundrum: what is all this magic internet money supposed to be good for, anyway?  7. DeFi adoption  “DeFi,” or “decentralized finance,” is the latest narrative to capture the imagination of the ethereum-following futurists who believe decentralized applications and smart contracts are an invention on par with the joint stock corporation. For now, DeFi is a way for people who are already long ether to earn a little interest. Will it attract new users to crypto assets? Will banks without bankers allow global finance to make inroads into new parts of the global economy?  8. Central bank digital currencies  In 2019, Beijing’s talk of a digital yuan made China the first major economy on a path to issuing its own digital currency, based to some extent on bitcoin’s model for validating transactions and ownership. How would a digital yuan change crypto? How might it change the balance of economic power and the dollar’s status as global reserve currency? Will other countries move first, or follow? We may see the beginnings of a new chapter for an asset category that first gained adoption among libertarians.  9. “Institutional” flows  While we have yet to see the approval for a regulated bitcoin exchange traded fund in the U.S., other cryptocurrency derivatives such as bitcoin futures have passed the necessary checks and scrutiny of U.S. regulators. Chairman of the Commodity Futures and Trade Commission Heath Tarbert went so far as to suggest in a speech this year that a regulated ethereum futures market in the U.S. is also not far off from being approved. How great of an impact might these new financial tools have on the level of institutional participation in crypto come 2020? At least from the trading volume of Bakkt futures, the answer so far seems to be not a lot. This might change however in the new year and is well worth watching for signs of significant growth.  10. Ethereum 2.0 launches  Ethereum since its activation in 2015 has operated with a similar security scheme as the world’s first cryptocurrency, bitcoin. Called a consensus model, both ethereum and bitcoin currently operate under a “proof-of-work” consensus model. In early 2020, ethereum developers expect to overhaul this design for a new one called “proof-of-stake.” While other cryptocurrencies have already attempted to build blockchains leveraging proof-of-stake, ethereum will be by far the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization to experiment with this design.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | ETH | FIAT | RESEARCH | TOKEN SALE,"Galen Moore, Christine Kim",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/18/10-things-to-watch-for-in-crypto-in-2020,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f9c67e4cd78eaa5d5f2f870c17c9f02c1f240638-1652x1340.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Riccardo Spagni, better known by the alias ""Fluffypony,"" will relinquish his day-to-day leadership role in the privacy coin project. Longtime contributor ""Snipa"" will assume the responsibilities of lead maintainer, according to a post by the monero core team.      The post says the move is being made to ""better streamline developments and collaborations"" but does not say when the changeover will take place, although it notes Spagni ""will continue as a backup maintainer to relieve Snipa during times when he is busy or on vacation."" Spagni also plans to continue working on Tari, a decentralized asset protocol built on the monero blockchain.      ""I'm stepping back as lead maintainer but continuing on as a maintainer, to further decentralize the project,"" Spagni told Decrypt Wednesday.      Spagni has been the lead maintainer since monero began in 2014. The role includes leading development and engineering efforts as well as administrative functions, such as signing off on email announcements.      He previously admitted the role left him feeling exhausted, telling CoinDesk in May 2018: “I was the lead maintainer across all the projects, and at some point last year I was like: I can’t do this."" He continued: “I will always be an advocate for privacy, and for monero, a part of the monero community, but my actual responsibilities by definition need to be reduced.""      Spagni has gradually tried to detach himself from the project. Last year he stepped down as CEO of XMR wallet interface, MyMonero, and passed responsibilities for the official monero website and for all monero GUI [Graphic User Interface] projects to fellow core team member, luigi1111.      Spagni had previously said stepping down would decentralize monero.

42431301,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1XXh,1576677600,Kyber Network Aims to Improve DeFi Liquidity With ‘Katalyst’ Protocol Upgrade,"Kyber Network, the ethereum-based protocol focused on aggregating liquidity and facilitating swaps for ERC-20 tokens, is about to launch a major upgrade.    Planned to go live in the second quarter of 2020, Katalyst is said to be a major upgrade to the Kyber protocol to better meet the liquidity needs of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.      Currently, the Kyber Network (KNC) design allows for any party to contribute to an aggregated pool of liquidity within each blockchain while providing a single endpoint for takers to execute trades using the best rates available.      Katalyst aims to reduce friction in liquidity contribution, introduce rebates for high-performing reserves (liquidity providers) and allow DApps integrated with Kyber to add a custom spread for flexible rates.      Simon Kim, CEO of Hashed, a blockchain venture capitalist firm based in Seoul and California's Silicon Valley, said the introduction of Katalyst would be able to grow the network exponentially by providing greater incentives for its contributors.      “The Kyber Network has proven its utility as the most reliable liquidity pool for all the participants in the DeFi ecosystem on ethereum,” Kim said.      On top of liquidity optimization, the Katalyst upgrade will include a new staking mechanism and the launch of the KyberDAO, a community platform that allows KNC token holders to participate in governance for the first time.      Joshua Green, head of trading at Digital Asset Capital Management, a cryptocurrency trading firm based in Sydney, Australia, said as the DeFi space continues to move from its development phase to focus on users and transaction execution, liquidity becomes a more prominent driver of continued growth.      “We are excited by a number of projects and the disintermediating models they have developed,” Green said. “Higher levels of liquidity now need to follow to make them more efficient for the widest user base and make their value proposition as strong as possible against centralised peers.”      Trading on centralized exchanges is currently not compatible with DeFi applications since it is technically infeasible to bridge between decentralized applications and centralized servers without compromising the trust model.      KNC is currently up 27 percent over the last 30 days and is up 78 percent year-to-date making it one best-performing crypto assets for 2019. It is currently changing hands for $0.22, according to data provider Messari.

42431308,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1Xlh,1576677600,Tradeshift Says It's Slashed Cross-Border Transaction Costs Using Ethereum,"Supply chain fintech startup Tradeshift, which boasts two million firms on its platform, says it's slashed the cost of cross-border transactions between buyers and suppliers using the public ethereum blockchain.       Tradeshift Frontiers, the innovation division of the Goldman Sachs-backed unicorn, represents invoice values as tokenized IOUs between buyers and sellers and then settles them in a novel form of on-chain fiat currency.      FlowTokens, as the tokenized IOUs are called, has implications for banks and financial institutions that typically make money on cross-border payments. It could do for supply chain management and trade finance what Libra has been attempting to do at a consumer level with wallets and stablecoins.      Tradeshift, which partnered with Consensys-backed e-money license holder Monerium, completed a domestic transaction earlier this year. This involved retailer Nordic Store and IKEA Iceland, which were issued an e-invoice through Tradeshift; a day later, the transaction was settled through a smart contract.      This next phase of piloting has seen cross-border transactions involving euro-denominated e-money inside the smart contract. Tradeshift and Monerium settled first €1024 (US$1,141.78) and then €512, at a fixed fee cost of 17 cents and 16 cents, respectively, the companies said. (For comparison, using Automated Clearing House in the United States typically costs somewhere between 20 cents and $1.50 in fixed fee, or 0.5 percent to 1.5 percent in variable fee.)      Tradeshift said its preliminary research of the payments space shows that fees vary wildly. To settle a cross-border transaction in the €1000 range can cost between €0 when, for example, using the SEPA payment system in Europe, to €30 or more for doing regional transfers between continents.      Monerium co-founder and CEO Sveinn Valfells said e-money is the oldest and most proven framework for digital cash in any major jurisdiction. “We are deliberately going slow and trying not to break things, which is how it should be in finance,” he added.      Valfells said Monerium’s e-money on ethereum has now been approved for use in Iceland, Denmark, Germany, U.K., Lithuania, France and Sweden.      “We issue e-money on ethereum to an ERC-20 compliant smart contract that works as a programmable passbook. Subject to KYC/AML, we issue the e-money as a balance to a person's public key into our ERC-20 contract. They are then at liberty to use that e-money as they would if it were issued in some other digital format,” he said.      As for cross-border payments, Gert Sylvest, co-founder of Tradeshift and GM of Tradeshift Frontiers, said, “We have taken an accepted invoice and tokenized it on ethereum. On the due day, a smart contract automatically swaps the tokenized invoice for the e-money that is on-chain.”      “Obviously a blockchain really doesn't care about whether or not that is [a] cross-border or domestic transfer, so the settlement cost is going to be the same,” he added.      In terms of timeline, Sylvest said he could not set a date for going into production, but the first quarter of next year would be used to “validate interest on the back end” among users of the platform.      Crippling costs and a general lack of transparency when it comes to paying suppliers overseas were among the complaints voiced by Hafsteinn Guðbjartsson, CEO, Nordic Store, which is testing the new blockchain system.      Much of Nordic Store’s inventory comes from abroad and involves multiple currencies routed through its Icelandic bank to the banks of suppliers and manufacturers, a long and opaque process that is also prone to error, said Guðbjartsson.      “We send a lot of money to China, which is pretty opaque. Thailand is probably the most problematic; I guess they have some kind of financial constraints on their currency or something, and we cannot buy Thai baht,” he said.      “So we send them dollars, and in the process of sending them dollars they never receive the same amount as they invoiced for. Our bank charges, but their bank seems to take a lot of money. We always have to send another small payment. It's just extra work for nothing, really.”      There are also implications when it comes to trade finance, since Tradeshift opens financing options beyond banks to a wide range of potential investors on the platform, which can reach right across the supply chain.      “If you turn invoices into real programmable assets you open up a whole new generation of financial services, “ said Sylvest.      Small companies are “the cash cows of large corporates everywhere in the world,” he added. The smaller the company, the harder to get access to finance, which can come at an outrageous price.      “It all reflects the fact that banks and financiers typically don't have any kind of insight into what is happening inside small companies, who are they trading with and what are the promises being exchanged between parties,” said Sylvest.      Update (Dec. 18, 16:35 UTC): An earlier version of this story used the wrong name for Tradeshift's tokenized IOUs.

Launched earlier on Wednesday, the public beta version allows users to paste code for analysis, during which it identifies security risks by testing the functionality and efficiency of a smart contract, as well as evaluating the quality of the coding.      Currently the service can only review ERC-20-based smart contracts, which are written in the Solidity programming language. EY has not said whether it plans to expand support to other blockchain protocols in the future.      A Reddit post from a user called ""pbrody,"" most likely EY’s global blockchain lead, Paul Brody, said the company planned to launch its testing service into production shortly.      EY initially unveiled the service – originally known as the EY Smart Contract Analyzer – in April, and has spent the eight months since testing the service in private beta.      By reviewing their tokens' code, investors will be able to monitor changes in the software and ensure tokens and smart contracts meet accepted industry standards, EY says. Tokens can also be stress-tested in a range of transaction scenarios, using data collected from the ethereum blockchain.      “Our clients are increasingly entrusting key enterprise business processes and valuable investments to software code,” Brody said in the April announcement. “We don’t run enterprise computing systems without anti-virus tools and it only makes sense to run blockchain-based investment systems with smart contract and token testing tools.”      EY’s review service will form part of the company’s broader Blockchain Analyzer, an analytics tool that compiles and reports transaction data, making financial reporting and auditing on the blockchain possible.      The second iteration of the Blockchain Analyzer, also unveiled in April, increased the number of supported protocols, including private blockchains, as well as enabling analysis of privacy enhancing, zero-knowledge proof-based transactions. An EY project for running private transactions on the ethereum blockchain, known as ‘Nightfall’, has also been integrated into Analyzer.      Back in October, EY said it had developed a blockchain tool for governments to track and analyze their own transactions, something the company said would improve transparency and accountability in the management of public funds.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/12/18/ey-launches-token-and-smart-contract-testing-service-in-open-beta,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a5a2b9ce2ab58d3abe2263072c53b58a14c14b3a-1500x877.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431299,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1XTh,1576672259,Ex-Kraken Employee Alleges 'Unethical and Illegal Tactics' in Discrimination Lawsuit,"Kraken, the U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange, is being sued by an ex-employee who alleges the company unfairly fired him for raising serious issues with its business practices.      The case – filed Nov. 26 in California– has been brought by Nathan Runyon, a military veteran with disabilities. While he seeks damages related to harassment at work, discrimination and breach of contract, some of the claims made against Kraken (Payward Inc.) suggest wrongdoing at the exchange, if true. So far, the veracity of the allegations has not been determined.      In March 2018, Runyon was hired by the exchange as a financial analyst, according to the filing. In his role under Kaiser Ng, Kraken’s chief financial officer (who is also being sued), Runyon claims he was ultimately fired for repeatedly raising issues of concern within the company.      Among other allegations, he states that he was asked by Ng to produce information to help pass an audit regardless of whether that information was accurate. He also says he found stock options grant vesting schedules had been quietly changed from what was declared in board meeting minutes, and that he'd been told to ignore it after attempting to correct the matter.      Runyon also makes the serious allegation that Kraken had earned income illegally from sanctioned nations and firms on the Office of Foreign Assets Control’s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List. This Runyon says he knew because he was provided with a list of revenue streams. Runyon said he expressed concerns ""multiple times"" but was ignored.      Another concerning allegation is that Runyon says he was asked by Ng to help reconcile customer and operating account balances with the firm's bank balances. Runyon says he discovered the bank accounts held less than they should have, to the tune of ""millions of dollars.""      The ex-employee claims he brought the issue to the attention of Ng fearing a hack or embezzlement, but was ""immediately removed"" from working on those accounts.      Oddly, Runyon further claims that he was pressured to let Kraken rent a room in his house in order to be able to use his home address for company purposes, but was never paid the agreed rent.      Runyon's contract was terminated on Aug. 1, 2019, he claims, because he had discovered that Ng ""was defrauding Kraken employees"" over their stock options.      Discussing the case in a blog post, blockchain author and journalist David Gerard says he spoke to Runyon's attorney, Claire Cochran, who said the plaintiff's address was still being listed by Kraken as that of its CFO, Ng.      The exchange told CoinDesk it could not comment on ""pending legal matters.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/18/ex-kraken-employee-alleges-unethical-and-illegal-tactics-in-discrimination-lawsuit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ee573bd500e18702c47e5dd9d481aea9b76b3c7f-1000x734.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431314,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1Y1h,1576667450,Bitcoin Drops Below Major Price Support for First Time Since May,"View  Bitcoin has found acceptance under the three-day chart's 200-period average for the first time in seven months.  The breakdown may attract stronger selling pressure, yielding a slide below the November low of $6,500.  A minor bounce to $6,800 may be seen before a deeper slide, with the intraday charts reporting oversold conditions.  A UTC close above the Nov. 29 high of $7,870 is needed to confirm a short-term bullish reversal.    Bitcoin risks dropping to seven-month lows below $6,500, having found acceptance under a key long-term price support.      The top cryptocurrency by market value fell by 6.33 percent in the three days to Dec. 17 (data from Bitstamp), erasing almost the entire corrective bounce from $6,500 to $7,870 witnessed in the last week of November.      More importantly, the three-day candle, representing the price action for Dec. 15-17, closed below the 200-period moving average (MA) – a level considered a barometer of the long-term market trend.      That's the first time the 200 MA has been breached since May. Bitcoin now faces stronger selling pressure and could see a drop below the November low of $6,511.      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $6,640 on Bitstamp, representing a 3 percent decline on a 24-hour basis. The three-day 200-period MA is lined up at $6,948.    3-day chart    Bitcoin’s previous three-day candle closed well below the 200-period MA, unlike the hammer candle witnessed in late November, which printed lows below the average support but closed higher.      The latest breakdown of the major support is backed by a bearish below-50 reading on the relative strength index (RSI) and descending 5- and 10-period MAs. Further, the 5- and 200-period MAs look set to produce the first bear cross since October 2018.      The chart also shows that cryptocurrency is trapped in a five-month falling channel, meaning the broader market trend is also bearish.      Thus, the odds appear stacked in favor of a violation at $6,500 (November low). That would expose the next support at $6,378 ( Nov. 3, 2018 high).      It's worth noting that bitcoin has already retracted 50 percent of the rally from December 2018 lows near $3,100 to the June 2019 high of $13,880.    Daily chart    The RSI has dropped below 30, but is holding well above the low of 22 registered in November. Put simply, there's room for a deeper price slide.      The MACD histogram is beginning to produce deeper bars below the zero line – a sign the downside move is gathering traction.      A UTC close above $7,870 is needed to invalidate the bearish lower highs set up and confirm a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.    Hourly and 4-hour charts    The RSI on the hourly chart has risen from oversold territory, signaling scope for a price bounce. The 4-hour chart RSI is also indicating oversold conditions.      So, a minor corrective rally to resistance at $6,800-$6,948 cannot be ruled out, before the sell-off returns, as suggested by three-day and daily charts.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/18/bitcoin-drops-below-major-price-support-for-first-time-since-may,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9ac96ae6206d0c031429a3cbc8e2df7a3e498fdd-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431296,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1XRh,1576665297,"HTC to Increase Focus on Blockchain Phones, AI After New Staff Cuts","Taiwanese phone manufacturer HTC confirmed earlier this week that it would axe jobs to remain competitive and better focus on a handful of high-end products, including the EXODUS, its blockchain phone.      HTC, which has around 3,000 employees, has not disclosed the scale of the lay-offs or the departments that will be most affected, according to a report from Taiwan News. This will be the third round of job cuts staff at the phone manufacturer have faced in the past five years. The company let go 2,250 employees in 2015, and cut a further 1,500 in July 2018.      HTC says the downsize will allow it to retain an innovative edge for a selection of its products. This includes its virtual reality system VIVE, as well as the EXODUS, its series of blockchain-powered smartphones.      First unveiled in May 2018, HTC’s EXODUS phones can connect to decentralized networks and allow users to download and run decentralized applications in much the same way as conventional apps run on smartphones. The phone also doubles up as a hardware wallet, providing owners with a secure and mobile means to hold their cryptocurrencies.      An in-wallet cryptocurrency swap feature, initially enabling quick exchanges between ERC-20 tokens, was added earlier this year.      The EXODUS went on sale at the end of 2018, and was initially only available to buy in cryptocurrency. HTC’s latest blockchain-powered phone, unveiled this October, can run a full bitcoin node. Future plans include adding support for Binance Chain, with a new special edition of the phone.      The EXODUS isn’t the only blockchain phone on the market. Sirin Labs also began shipping its own blockchain phone, the Finney, at the end of 2018. Samsung released its Galaxy S10 earlier this year, which is fully compatible with ERC-20s, dapps and bitcoin. There have also been reports that LG is contemplating launching its own product, although nothing has been confirmed.      More generally, competition in the smartphone space, from established rivals like Samsung and Apple, as well as new entrants like Google, has hit HTC’s market share and may have placed the company under substantial financial pressure.

42431295,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1XVh,1576638000,Crypto-Mining Attacks Fell Sharply in 2019 but Ransomware Is Trending: Kaspersky,"In the cat-and-mouse game between hackers and users, less-lucrative crypto-mining malware fell out of favor this year.      While security experts at Kaspersky found that the number of ""unique malicious objects"" rose by 13.7 percent – led in part by a 187 percent increase in so-called web-skimmer files, malware designed to steal credit card information – the total number of mining malware infections fell drastically.      Web-miner infections were down 59 percent year-over-year, from 5,638,828 infected machines to 2,259,038. However, malware like Trojan.Script.Miner.gen, Trojan.BAT.Miner.gen and Trojan.JS.Miner.m are still on the list of top 20 threats. These apps force a user's computer to mine cryptocurrency, bogging down the user's computer and essentially stealing electricity.      ""We have observed that the number of 'common' attacks against home users is slightly decreasing, but that the number of 'loud' public cases of crypto-ransomware infections is growing – for example, just two days ago New Orleans was hit by a ransomware,"" said Denis Parinov, a security analyst for Kaspersky.      Parinov believes the hackers involved in mining are moving on to more lucrative opportunities. Interestingly, the company found that even phone scammers were requesting prepaid debit card ransoms rather than cryptocurrencies.      ""[Mining attacks] have lost their popularity due to lower profitability and cryptocurrencies’ fight against covert mining,"" Kaspersky's head of anti-malware research, Vyacheslav Zakorzhevsky, said in a statement.    Monero's role    A few things changed on the security landscape to push crypto into a corner.      ""One of the most well-known web-mining services, Coinhive, declared that it is no longer economically viable,"" he said. ""This is due to the Monero hard fork and the severe drop of XMR cost on the market. We suspect this is caused by the market and community reaction to the fact that web mining has been used without user consent in most cases.""      The company found that while crypto-mining attacks fell, there was still interest in crypto-ransomware attacks.      ""Crypto-miners and crypto-ransomware operators are still in the game, but their focus appears to have moved to targeted attacks,"" said Parinov.      Parinov warns that mining attacks still exist and that users should remain vigilant. He reminded users to watch for unusual network activity or PC slowdowns.      ""The main symptom is the slowing down of overall computer or process performance – some freezes or errors can appear on the PC,"" he said. ""Additionally, crypto mining requires specific network interactions, but these may be hard to spot for the regular PC user.""",NEUTRAL,XMR,MARKET | MINING | XMR | RESEARCH | FORKS,John Biggs,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/12/18/crypto-mining-attacks-fell-sharply-in-2019-but-ransomware-is-trending-kaspersky,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/805e09aeca7d0ab3719bd1e5f5afbedf9d3ee22e-1500x801.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
