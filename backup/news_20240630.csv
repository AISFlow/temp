According to a crypto analyst known pseudonymously on social media as ZAYK Charts, XRP has been forming a wedge pattern over the past few months that could succumb to a 40% breakout from the current price level. Related Reading: Solana Poised For Epic Reversal? Analyst Spots Bullish Pattern Echoing 2022 Breakout XRP On The Verge Of Breaking Out Like most cryptocurrencies, the price of XRP has declined in the past few weeks. Price data from Coinmarketcap shows it has declined by over 9% from its peak of $0.528 in the first week of June. This has left investors wondering if XRP will extend this price decline in July, which could see it fall below $0.45 again. However, a recent falling wedge pattern suggests the reverse could be the case. A falling wedge forms when the price action makes lower highs and lower lows, with the contracting lines converging. This creates a wedge-like shape on the chart. The slope is downward but not as steep as at the start of the pattern. According to an XRP price chart shared on social media by ZAYK, the cryptocurrency is currently on a falling wedge formation in the 12-hour timeframe. ZAYK believes a breakout above the wedge could send the altcoin surging around 40% from current levels to around $0.65. $XRP Falling Wedge Formation in 12H timeframe‚úÖ When a breakout happens, we anticipate 30-40% Bullish waveüìà#XRP #XRPUSDT #Ripple #Crypto pic.twitter.com/aNnRacGFv4 ‚Äî ZAYK Charts (@ZAYKCharts) June 28, 2024 Crypto Analysts Align: XRP Poised For Breakout? Interestingly, ZAYK‚Äôs XRP outlook aligns with a similar analysis by Captain Faibik, another popular crypto analyst. Faibik‚Äôs analysis is based on the daily candle timeframe, which also shows a similar wedge formation. According to the analyst predictions, if the crypto manages to break through the upper resistance of the wedge, we could see a massive 40% price surge to $0.69 in August. While the breakout predicted by ZAYK and Faibik carries immense potential upside, they pale in comparison to EGRAG‚Äôs bullish outlook. This analyst, known for his bullish stance on XRP, believes it is still on track to reach a target of $6.4. As demonstrated by EGRAG‚Äôs latest XRP analysis, the recent price downturn is simply a natural consolidation, and the monthly time frame candle formation is still closing above Fib 0.236. A successful flip would see the coin push to the Fib 0.5 retracement at $0.75 before jetting off to the Fib 1.618 at $6.4. Related Reading: XRP Year-Long Curse Broken? Analyst Bullish On Crypto‚Äôs 240% Rally At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.474, which is still a long way from EGRAG‚Äôs price target.

From bitcoin‚Äôs price hitting all-time highs to Solana‚Äôs continued rise, our predictions have been put to the test. We review the key developments and trends shaping the crypto market this year so far. Scoreboard check! We've hit the mid-year mark of 2024, and it's time to tally up our top 15 Crypto Predictions for 2024 that we outlined at the end of last year. Spoiler alert: our home-field referee awarded us 95 out of 150 possible points. From bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) price hitting all-time highs to Solana's ( SOL-USD ) continued rise, our predictions have been put to the test. Let's break down the play-by-play of where we nailed it and where we missed the mark. Join us as we review the key developments and trends shaping the crypto market this year so far. 1. The U.S. Recession and the First Spot Bitcoin ETPs Prediction : The U.S. would enter a recession in the first half of 2024, and the first spot bitcoin ETPs would launch with significant inflows, keeping Bitcoin above $30k. Review: Although there are clear signs of economic slowing, with GDP slowing to a 1.3% annualized growth rate, the U.S. has not officially entered a recession. Key indicators like consumer spending and corporate earnings have shown resilience, mitigating the impacts of inflation and supply chain issues. However, the U.S. yield curve has been inverted for more than 700 days, the longest such streak in bond market history, often a precursor to recession. Jobless claims and corporate bankruptcy filings have also risen. As for the spot bitcoin ETPs, the approval and launch of the first spot bitcoin ETPs on January 11, 2024, was a significant milestone. The ETPs saw overwhelming demand, with inflows surpassing $2 billion in the first month alone. This influx of investment played a crucial role in driving bitcoin to an all-time high of $73,000 in March and maintaining its price above $30k throughout the year. The success of these ETPs has provided a new, regulated avenue for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin, significantly boosting its market appeal and stability.

Bitcoin Halving Prediction : The Bitcoin halving in April 2024 would proceed without major issues, and post-halving, bitcoin would rise above $48k. Review: The Bitcoin halving event in April 2024 occurred without any significant disruptions, demonstrating the network's stability and robustness. This halving reduced the block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, effectively decreasing the rate at which new Bitcoin is introduced into circulation. Contrary to expectations of a brief consolidation period post-halving, bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of $73,000 in March, well ahead of the halving. This early rally was likely fueled by the anticipation of the halving and the massive inflows from newly launched bitcoin ETPs. Bitcoin's price remains strong at $67,500, far surpassing the $48k target we had set post-halving.

Bitcoin's All-Time High in Q4 Prediction : Bitcoin will reach an all-time high in Q4 2024, driven by political changes and regulatory optimism. Review: Bitcoin's price soared to a new all-time high of $73,000 in March 2024, much earlier than our Q4 prediction. This surge was driven by the approval and subsequent success of the spot bitcoin ETPs in January, which attracted significant investment and heightened market confidence. The early achievement of this milestone was facilitated by positive regulatory developments and growing institutional interest. Although this prediction came to fruition ahead of schedule, the factors we predicted to drive the new high-regulatory progress and market optimism-were spot-on. The current price of $67,500 reflects the sustained interest and confidence in Bitcoin as a leading digital asset.

Ethereum Won't Flip Bitcoin in 2024 Prediction : Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) would not surpass Bitcoin in market cap but outperform mega-cap tech stocks. Review: Ethereum remains well behind Bitcoin in market capitalization, particularly in light of Bitcoin's record-breaking performance this year. Despite this, Ethereum has had a strong year, outpacing many of the largest tech stocks in terms of growth and market performance. Its ecosystem continues to expand, driven by advancements like the EIP-4844 upgrade and the growing adoption of Layer 2 solutions. Despite not surpassing Bitcoin, Ethereum's resilience and robust growth align well with our prediction of its strong market performance relative to major tech stocks.

Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) Dominance Prediction : Post EIP-4844, Ethereum Layer 2 solutions would capture the majority of EVM-compatible TVL and volume. Review: While the rollout of EIP-4844 has significantly boosted the adoption of Ethereum Layer 2 solutions, we are still waiting to see L2s attract more TVL or DEX activity than Ethereum. However, while Ethereum TVL share vs. L2s is roughly where it was at the beginning of 2024, DEX Volumes are slowly transitioning to L2s. This is mainly because Ethereum has made a dedicated data layer for L2s to post data. This moved activity from Ethereum's transaction layer, freeing up block space and making transactions on Ethereum less expensive. While L2s cost substantially less than Ethereum to use, often 100x cheaper, many participants still choose to pay higher Ethereum fees. This may be due to the stickiness of Ethereum TVL, the broader range of trading venues, and the large supply of tradeable assets. Within L2s, the consolidation of market share among the leading solutions is evident, with Base and Arbitrum seizing the majority (~80) of DEX Volume and TVL (>50%). The consolidation amongst L2s demonstrates the power of composability and network effect.

NFT Activity Rebounds Prediction: The NFT market experienced a resurgence in the first half of 2024 compared to the latter half of 2023, predominantly on Ethereum, which remains the leader in NFT activity. New high-profile collections and ongoing interest have driven trading volumes upward, although these volumes are still far from the all-time highs seen in 2021. An exciting development has been the introduction of NFTs on the Bitcoin network through the Ordinals protocol, adding a new dimension to the market and attracting a fresh wave of investors and collectors. Despite this positive trend, the overall NFT volume far from its previous peaks. Instead, some of the speculative trading volume has shifted towards meme coins, which have supplanted NFTs in attracting speculative investors Rating: 3/10 Monthly NFT Trading Volumes (Ethereum vs. Bitcoin) Source: Artemis.xyz and cryptoslam! as of 6/24/2024.

Binance Loses Top Spot Prediction : Binance ( BNB-USD ) would lose its position as the top spot trading exchange. Review: Despite regulatory scrutiny and increasing competition, Binance has retained its position as the leading centralized exchange by trading volume in 2024. However, its dominance is being challenged by competitors like OKX, Bybit, and Coinbase ( COIN ), which have gained market share. Binance's deep liquidity and extensive user base support its leadership, but the narrowing gap with its rivals suggests a more competitive landscape. Although Binance has yet to lose its top spot and still holds over half of all spot volumes, the intensifying competition highlights the changing dynamics in the centralized exchange market.

Stablecoin Market Cap Growth Prediction : The stablecoin market cap would reach a new all-time high, with USDC surpassing USDT in market share. Review: The stablecoin market has continued to grow in 2024, but it has yet to achieve the $200 billion milestone. USDC has been gaining ground, particularly among institutional users, due to its reputation for regulatory compliance. However, USDT remains the dominant stablecoin, primarily because of its entrenched position on Tron, which accounts for ~50% of USDT supply and widespread usage in trading. The dynamics between USDC and USDT show a trend toward increasing competition, with USDC closing the gap but not yet overtaking USDT. The stablecoin market's growth and evolving competitive landscape reflects our prediction, though the shift in dominance is still developing.

DEX Market Share Increase Prediction : Decentralized exchanges (DEXes) would capture a larger share of the spot trading market. Review: Decentralized exchanges have continued to grow in market share throughout 2024. The improved user interfaces, lower fees, and enhanced liquidity offered by DEXes have attracted more traders. High-throughput blockchains and Layer 2 solutions have further facilitated this growth by providing faster and cheaper transactions. The ongoing trend towards self-custody and decentralized finance ('DEFI') supports this shift, with DEXes capturing an increasingly significant portion of the spot trading market. This aligns well with our prediction and underscores the evolving preference for decentralized trading platforms.

Bitcoin Yield Opportunities Prediction : Remittances and smart contract platforms would create new yield opportunities for Bitcoin. Review: Bitcoin's role in remittances has expanded in 2024, particularly in regions with high remittance flows and limited access to traditional financial services. Platforms leveraging Bitcoin and Layer 2 solutions like the Lightning Network have made transactions faster and cheaper. Additionally, yield opportunities for Bitcoin holders have emerged through staking and lending protocols that offer returns on bitcoin assets. These developments align well with our prediction, as they enhance Bitcoin's utility beyond mere transactions and provide new ways for holders to earn yields. However, the full potential of these opportunities is still unfolding, with ongoing adoption and innovation. Rating: 4/10 11. Breakout Blockchain Game Prediction : A blockchain game would surpass 1 million daily active users. Review: While several blockchain games have seen significant user engagement in 2024, none have consistently reached the 1 million daily active users milestone. High-quality titles like Illuvium ( ILV-USD ) and Guild of Guardians have attracted large communities but are still building their user bases. The integration of blockchain technology in gaming continues to evolve, with improvements in-game mechanics and user experience driving growth. Despite not hitting the 1 million user mark, these developments suggest a strong foundation for future success in the blockchain gaming sector. The potential for a breakout hit remains promising as the market matures. Rating: 5/10 12. Solana's Continued Rise Prediction : Solana would become a top 3 blockchain by market cap, TVL, and active users and join the ETPs wars. Review: Solana will continue to grow and strengthen its position in the blockchain ecosystem in 2024. It ranks highly in market capitalization, total value locked (TVL), and active users, though it has not yet cracked the top 3 in all these categories. Solana's ecosystem has attracted a wide range of projects and users, contributing to its strong market presence. However, solana-based ETPs have not yet emerged, contrary to our expectations. Despite this, Solana's ongoing growth and innovation highlight its significant impact and potential in blockchain.

Adoption of DePin Networks Prediction : Decentralized physical infrastructure networks like Hivemapper and Helium would see significant adoption. Review: Decentralized physical infrastructure (DePin) networks such as Hivemapper and Helium have made notable progress in 2024. Hivemapper has expanded its mapping capabilities, and Helium has increased its subscriber base for its decentralized wireless network. These networks use blockchain technology to create community-driven services, offering an alternative to traditional centralized systems. While adoption has grown, these platforms are still in the early stages of capturing significant market share from established giants like Google and traditional telecom providers. The potential for disruptive growth remains, but widespread adoption is yet to be fully realized. Rating: 7/10 Growth Metrics of Hivemapper and Helium Networks Source: Artemis.xyz as of 6/13/2024.

New Corporate Crypto Accounting Prediction : New FASB guidelines would rejuvenate corporate crypto holdings, and Coinbase would break out L2 revenues. Review: The Financial Accounting Standards Board ('FASB') guidelines allowing corporates to report mark-to-market gains on crypto assets are set to take effect in 2025, with anticipation building throughout 2024. Some non-crypto companies have already added BTC to their treasuries, and these include US publicly traded health tech company Semler Scientific ( SMLR, $40M), wealth and payments business MOGO ($5M), Japanese hotel services company Metaplanet ($7.2M). But wide-scale adoption has yet to occur. Within crypto, Defi Technologies recently added $7.5M in BTC to its treasury. However, the adoption of BTC by a greater treasury has yet to materialize. Coinbase, while advancing its Layer 2 (L2) solutions like Base Protocol, has not reported L2-specific revenues in its filings and instead tucks it under the broader category of ""Subscriptions and Services."". The corporate adoption of crypto assets is increasing, with more firms exploring blockchain applications and digital asset holdings. Our prediction points towards future developments that are still on the horizon, with current trends suggesting growing interest and preparation for these changes.

This is because the price of Bitcoin virtually declined throughout the month, leaving many investors, especially short-term holders, disappointed. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Army On The Move: 35 Billion SHIB Invade Shibarium However, despite the price decline, on-chain data suggests that Bitcoin adoption is growing. New data shows the number of new Bitcoin addresses being created has surged to the highest level in two months. This growth suggests the long-term prospects for Bitcoin remain strong. New BTC Addresses Surge To 2-Month High Despite the price slump, the network is exhibiting a promising trend that signals future growth for the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency. According to Glassnode chart data initially shared on social media platform X by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, new BTC wallet addresses have risen steadily over the past week to reach 352,124, their highest level since April. Interestingly, the chart shows that the recent uptick in new addresses contrasts with a larger decrease in the creation of new addresses since November 2023. This new increase points to an influx of new users entering the crypto space. As more people adopt Bitcoin, demand will inevitably grow, which is a catalyst for price surges down the line. Furthermore, Martinez suggested that the uptick in new addresses is from retail investors making a comeback. While institutional investors often drive major market moves, retail interest is crucial for Bitcoin‚Äôs mainstream adoption. Retail #Bitcoin investors are making a comeback! The number of new $BTC addresses on the network surged to 352,124, marking the highest level since April. pic.twitter.com/GFOHnsokz0 ‚Äî Ali (@ali_charts) June 29, 2024 A major part of the increase in new addresses can be attributed to recent adoption in the Brazilian market. Nubank, Brazil‚Äôs biggest neobank, recently announced plans to integrate Bitcoin‚Äôs lightning network into its services. As the largest fintech bank in Latin America, this integration could potentially expose a significant portion of its 100 million customers to the digital asset. What‚Äôs Next For Bitcoin? At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $61,446. The leading digital asset has lost over 10% of its market cap in a 30-day time frame and the bulls are struggling to break above $61,000. This downtrend could be attributed to a selloff by miners and many long-term holders. Specifically, around 40,000 BTC were sold by long-term holders in June. Bear markets are temporary. Bull runs will return. It‚Äôs just a matter of when, not if. With the second half of the year now approaching, time can only tell how the price of Bitcoin unfolds. Of course, new wallet addresses don‚Äôt directly impact price, but they are a leading indicator of growing Bitcoin adoption. Related Reading: XRP Year-Long Curse Broken?

Related Reading: Solana Poised For Epic Reversal? Analyst Spots Bullish Pattern Echoing 2022 Breakout Investor excitement was dampened when the US Securities and Exchange Commission unexpectedly sent back applicants‚Äô proposals, delaying the much-anticipated debut. Missed Exit: Ethereum ETF July Launch Goes Up In Smoke The news came as a shock to many, as market watchers and analysts alike had confidently predicted a July launch, with some even suggesting a celebratory trade on Independence Day. Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart were among those waving the checkered flag a little too early. Their prediction of a July 2nd debut went kaput after the SEC decided to put the brakes on the process. Unfort think we gonna have to push back our over/under till after holiday. Sounds like SEC took extra time to get back to ppl this wk (altho again very light tweaks) and from what I hear next wk is dead bc holiday = July 8th the process resumes and soon after that they‚Äôll launch‚Ä¶ https://t.co/0ZQR7yiBLt ‚Äî Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 28, 2024 Insiders claim that the SEC has delayed the anticipated debut date by requesting changes to the S-1 documents that issuers have submitted. Think of the S-1 Form as a company‚Äôs passport to going public. This first step in the rigorous registration process with the SEC provides all the necessary details for the regulator to examine the entity before it offers shares to the public for the first time. Now, this unexpected diversion raises serious concerns about the schedule as a whole. Although there are others who anticipate the green light by July 8th, the impending US holiday probably adds another layer of wrinkle. Uncharted Territory: The SEC Takes The Wheel For issuers and investors alike, the absence of a clear timetable is a major source of discomfort. In contrast to the earlier 19b-4 forms, which required the SEC to make a decision within a certain amount of time, the S-1 filing process allows the regulatory body as much time as it needs. This essentially gives the SEC full control, enabling them to make changes requests and perform a comprehensive assessment without feeling pressed for time. While SEC boss Gary Gensler has previously hinted at approvals ‚Äúsometime this summer,‚Äù his comments haven‚Äôt offered much solace to the jittery market. The recent snafu with the S-1 forms indicates that even a summer launch might be overly optimistic. Related Reading: XRP Year-Long Curse Broken?

30179423,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627071,1719739841,"14,000 BTC Transferred To Exchanges In Four Days ‚Äì Worrying Trend For Bitcoin Price?","Recent on-chain data shows that substantial amounts of Bitcoin have made their way to centralized exchanges in the last few days. How could this impact the Bitcoin price? Bitcoin Price To Face Further Selling Pressure? In a new post on the X platform, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that Bitcoin investors have been transferring their assets to centralized exchanges in recent days. The relevant indicator here is CryptoQuant‚Äôs Exchange Reserve metric, which tracks the total amount of a particular cryptocurrency held on all exchanges. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Army On The Move: 35 Billion SHIB Invade Shibarium It is worth noting that the value of this metric rises when investors are making more deposits than withdrawals of a cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, in this scenario) into centralized exchanges. Meanwhile, when the metric‚Äôs value falls, it means that holders are transferring their assets out of the trading platforms. According to CryotoQuant data, more than 14,000 BTC (valued at approximately $851.2 million) have been sent to crypto exchanges in the last four days. As shown in the chart below, the exchange reserve metric is at its highest level in nearly a month. Typically, an increase in the exchange reserve indicates high selling pressure, as investors often use centralized exchanges to sell assets. Consequently, the movement of huge amounts to trading platforms could exacerbate the downward pressure on the Bitcoin price. Furthermore, the exodus of significant amounts to centralized exchanges could trigger price volatility for the premier cryptocurrency. This would imply an increased likelihood of big price movements in the future. However, there has not been any impact on the Bitcoin price in the past day. As of this writing, the price of the premier cryptocurrency stands at around $60,700, reflecting a bare 0.3% increase in the last 24 hours. Price Rebound Imminent For BTC: Santiment Fortunately, it is not all gloom for the Bitcoin price at the moment. Prominent on-chain analytics platform Santiment has offered a positive outlook for the price of the market leader. According to the blockchain firm, Bitcoin‚Äôs recovery following dips in the past two weeks has been short-lived. Santiment believes that a price rebound is imminent for the premier cryptocurrency. The rationale behind this analysis is based on two factors; the recent negative sentiment from the crowd and the low relative strength index (RSI). Santiment said in its post: But note the continued negative sentiment pouring in from the crowd, indicating their patience is wearing thin. This, along with a low RSI of just 36, are strong indications a bounce is close.

This price dip adds to the string of negative performances in the last month during which BTC has lost 9.88% of its value. However, Bitcoin has recently seen an increase in buying interest despite its recent price dips and popular notions that the maiden cryptocurrency is bound to remain in a consolidation state for now. Prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez has now stated another development that characterizes the resilient interest in Bitcoin amidst its current overall bearish trend. Related Reading: Analyst Identifies Bitcoin Liquidity Pools You Should Be Aware Of Going Into July Retail BTC Investors Return In Numbers: Incoming Price Rally? In an X post on Saturday, Martinez reported that the number of new Bitcoin (BTC) addresses reached 352,124 on Friday. This figure marks the highest level since April and breaks a downtrend that has persisted since November 2023. Based on this data, the crypto analyst announced¬†a resurgence in the number of retail Bitcoin investors indicating renewed interest from key players in the market. For context, retail investors refer to individual investors who trade assets for their personal accounts. They typically trade in smaller quantities than organizations but are quite important for market stability and liquidity. Generally, a rise in retail investors represents an increase in the token‚Äôs demand due to an influx of new participants to the market which can subsequently translate into a rise in market price. Furthermore, this surge in new addresses can be interpreted as a positive signal stating that individuals have disposable income and are willing to invest in speculative assets like Bitcoin. Finally, retail investors can also serve as a barometer for market sentiment with their increased activity indicating a broader bullish sentiment on Bitcoin‚Äôs future in the market. Interestingly, Bitcoin‚Äôs price already saw a slight increase of 0.92% on Saturday, briefly surpassing the $61,000 mark. However, it is still too early to determine if this price bounce could trigger a market rebound for the most valuable cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Price Correction Over? Here‚Äôs The Support Level To Watch Bitcoin Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $60,884, as it continues to move within the $60,100 to $63,200 range. The token‚Äôs daily trading volume has decreased by 49.16% and is now valued at $12.7 billion. If Bitcoin bulls can generate sufficient buying pressure to break out of this sideways movement, the asset could potentially return to $67,000.

The current price could be an attractive entry. Efficiency in Bitcoin mining operations is crucial post-halving, with Marathon Digital showing the least reduction in monthly BTC production among publicly traded miners, this adds to the stock's attractiveness. Marathon Digital introduces a two-phase immersion cooling system, potentially revolutionizing cooling solutions in data centers and Bitcoin mining operations. Marathon Digital (MARA), the well-known Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miner, reached a peak price during the last Bitcoin bull market, at around $76 per share in November 2021. The stock currently trades at around $19. Shares outstanding at the November 2021 high were 102.63 million shares, while shares outstanding today are 282.79 million shares. There has been a 175% dilution since November 2021. Reaching the previous all-time price at the current number of shares would mean a market cap of around $21.5 billion. This is around the combined market cap of all U.S.-listed Bitcoin miners. This is worth noting before moving into the rest of this article. The last Bitcoin bull run followed the third halving event in 2020, and many investors and analysts consider the halving event a strong catalyst for a Bitcoin price rally. The fourth Bitcoin halving event took place two months ago, and this sentiment of a price rally ahead is strongly shared among Bitcoin investors. A Bitcoin price rally typically extends to Bitcoin-linked stocks. During a Bitcoin bull market, Bitcoin companies that have shown efficiency in operations, good financial performance, or launched innovative products and services easily pick up on the Bitcoin-driven momentum. BTDR CLSK CORZ BITF MARA Jan. - Apr. average BTC mined ~292 ~687 ~907 ~303 ~915 May (post-halving) BTC production 184 417 448 156 616 Post-halving percentage -/+ -37% -39% -50% -48% -32% Following the recent halving event, miners have seen their monthly BTC production reduced (the halving event slashed block rewards in half). Marathon Digital‚Äôs post-halving efficiency is worth noting; the company was the least impacted by the halving in terms of monthly BTC production, following the operations updates released by miners in May. MARA‚Äôs production declined by ~32% compared to the average BTC produced between January and April - the lowest reduction in production among publicly traded Bitcoin miners. I've covered Marathon Digital two times in the past, the first coverage was in August last year and the second was in January. I was bearish on MARA in my August article due to the over 300% YTD non-catalyst-driven price surge the stock recorded at that time; however, in January , I saw the potential in the surge in transaction fees on the Bitcoin network as Bitcoin Ordinals were recording heightened activities, and I highlighted how Marathon Digital stood to gain from the heightened Ordinals activity (considering Marathon Digital runs its own mining pool), not also forgetting the momentum that was building around the spot Bitcoin ETF approval. Based on these factors, I gave MARA a rating upgrade to ‚Äúhold‚Äù in January. After the halving event, Marathon has proven a high level of efficiency and continues to work towards all-round vertical integration. Marathon Digital‚Äôs approach to mining operations efficiency is somewhat unique. The miner uses proprietary technology across software, firmware, and hardware, thus controlling several critical business variables for favorable operations. The latest addition to Marathon‚Äôs proprietary tech stack is its next-gen immersion cooling solution. Most analyses of BTC miners focus mainly on hashrate growth and electricity capacity, covering metrics like mining rigs output and the miner‚Äôs energy capacity (Th/s and MW). The effects and importance of efficient cooling systems for effective mining operations often take a back seat. I, however, consider cooling as a dark horse in Bitcoin miners‚Äô operational effectiveness. Marathon Digital Spearheads Two-phase Immersion Cooling in Bitcoin Mining Marathon Digital is a company that has always been big on optimization in both hardware and software, and this has set the company apart among Bitcoin miners. The company unveiled a two-phase immersion cooling (2PIC) system - the 2PIC700 tank at the Empower Conference in late March, in Houston - as an addition to its proprietary tech stack. There is a growing market demand for enhanced cooling solutions (like immersive cooling) driven by the increasing need for higher processing speeds and overclocking capabilities in high-performance computing (HPC) clusters used mainly for AI processing. Modor Intelligence Reports by market researchers suggest that the immersion cooling market in data centers will grow by ~26% CAGR between 2024 and 2029, reaching a $2.9 billion market size from the current ~$790 million market size. Note that this growth projection specifically focuses on immersion cooling adoption within HPC data centers. Edge data center market growth (Precedence Research) Other emerging tech sectors, like edge AI and IoT systems, could also very much see two-phase immersion cooling adoption at the edge; hence, the potential market size is much larger. The edge data center market size is projected to grow at around 18% CAGR, to reach a $60 billion market size by 2033, according to Precedence Research. Edge computing involves processing data in real-time near the data source; hence, the need for very fast processors in a constrained space. 2PIC gives the ability for computing power to be packed into a much smaller space while maintaining optimal chip temperature. The immersion cooling technique has been around for a while and has already witnessed some adoption in cloud data centers as well as in the Bitcoin mining sector. Alibaba ( BABA ) adopted immersion cooling for its data centers some years ago and has reportedly achieved better efficiency, recording a lower Power Usage Efficiency (PUE) at some of its data centers that have implemented immersion cooling. Currently, the well-known and widely-used immersion cooling technique is the single-phase immersion cooling (SPIC). In SPIC, computer components or ASIC miners (in the context of Bitcoin mining) are submerged into a single-phase hydrocarbon dielectric liquid coolant. The process is called single-phase because the liquid coolant doesn't change its state in the cooling process. The primary advantage of SPIC is its much higher power density compared to non-immersive cooling techniques. Cooling units efficiency and power density curve source (Open Compute Project) The graph above is from a presentation at the Open Compute Summit in 2018, comparing efficiency and power density among different cooling units. Here we see immersion cooling has the lowest PUE (best efficiency) and the highest power density (highest capacity). Single-phase and two-phase immersion cooling illustration (Marathon Digital) The latest iteration of immersion cooling is 2PIC. Just like SPIC, the 2PIC technique involves submerging computer components or ASIC miners (in the context of Bitcoin mining) into fluorinated dielectric fluid or coolant. The fluoride liquid cools the ASIC miners in a purpose-built tank. As heat is generated by the miners, the coolant absorbs latent energy, causing some of the fluoride liquid to transition into a gaseous state. Water-cooled coils acting as condensers at the top of the purpose-built tank condense the gaseous fluorinated fluid back into its liquid form, allowing it to return to the bottom of the tank for the cooling cycle to continue. This method, involving the change of state of the coolant, creates a more efficient cooling solution over SPIC. Fluorinated fluids in a gaseous state require less energy to cool back to liquid form compared to the cooling of hydrocarbon oils or coolants in the SPIC technique. In Bitcoin mining, improved cooling directly translates to higher realized hashrate as mining rigs will perform at their optimum if adequately cooled. Also, the adoption of immersion cooling in mining facilities significantly reduces overhead power consumption by minimizing the need for additional components that draw extra energy, such as large fans, external pumps, or heat exchangers, which are core components in air-cooled and hydro-cooled setups, giving the facility a better PUE and potentially translating into improved operational cost efficiency in the long-term. 2PIC700 overclocking calculation (Marathon Digital) The above image, showing data from the 2PIC700 calculator tool on Marathon Digital‚Äôs website, shows material changes in the output capacity of BITMAIN‚Äôs Antminer T21 when it is cooled through the MARA 2PIC700 tank. On the ‚Äú2PIC Overclock 1‚Äù column, the miner is overclocked (explain overclocking) by 56%. This resulted in a ~54% hashrate increase from the original 190 TH/s output. Though the mining efficiency dropped by around 13% from 19 J/Th to 21.5 J/Th, the hashrate increased by around 54% to 293 Th/s. A higher overclocking at 85% results in mining efficiency dropping from 19.0 J/th to 23.5 J/th (a ~23% decrease in efficiency) while hashrate increases by an impressive 85% to 352 Th/s. This is a very favorable trade-off between mining efficiency and hashrate. I believe that in seeking alpha in tech stocks, understanding a relatively lesser-known technology, its potential applications, and its disruptive impact allows investors to stand out early and stay ahead of the pack. I believe that the unveiling of Marathon Digital's 2PIC tank has not yet been fully priced into MARA, as the market appears to underestimate its potential as a catalyst for both the stock and the company‚Äôs growth. While analysts at JPMorgan still maintain their underweight rating for MARA , I take a bullish view. As I mentioned earlier, cooling metrics are typically considered ancillary by investors and analysts in analyzing Bitcoin miners. Other Noteworthy Latest Highlights on Marathon Digital ...as the BRC-20 ecosystem continues to grow, it will potentially bring higher fees to miners. As stated earlier, transaction fees become a relatively important part of a miner's earnings when block rewards get cut in half during halving. MARA is well-positioned to make the most of transaction fees post-halving because it owns and operates a self-mining pool. MaraPool represented more than 22% or about 380 BTC of MARA‚Äôs total Bitcoin production in December. This bodes well for MARA. Excerpt from my last MARA coverage. Since the fourth halving event in April and the ensuing slashing of block rewards in half, transaction fees have become an important part of miners‚Äô revenue, in addition to block rewards. Miners‚Äô revenue from transaction fees has grown immensely since the advent of the capability to add raw binary data called inscriptions on the Bitcoin network. These inscription transactions (which include multimedia and software files) have large byte data so they typically command higher fees. Inscriptions are like ‚ÄúNFTs‚Äù on the Bitcoin network. MARA Pool 0.85 inscription fee (TheMinerMag - Bitcoin Mining News, Data, Research and Analysis) Marathon Digital came in prepared for the halving, rightly anticipating the surge in transaction fees that would follow the halving‚Äôs reduction in block rewards. Marathon launched Slipstream in February - a Bitcoin Layer-2 service that allows direct and seamless submission of arbitrary data on the Bitcoin network, allowing users to send such transactions directly to Marathon Digital‚Äôs mining pool. I believe this is one of the factors that made Marathon Digital emerge as the least impacted miner by monthly BTC production after the halving event. That's impressive management prudence and foresight right there, in my view. It is worth mentioning that Slipstream service has attracted some criticism from a faction of the Bitcoin community who cited the possibility of transaction censorship as this goes against the Bitcoin network‚Äôs core ethos of total decentralization. Last week, Marathon Digital received a 0.85 BTC fee through its mining pool, MARA Pool, to inscribe a video on a Bitcoin transaction. MARA Pool included only 3 transactions in the block where this inscription was recorded and the 0.85 BTC inscription fee was much higher than the average 0.22 BTC fee recorded by other pools despite their processing an average of 4,500 P2PKH transactions (regular transactions) per block. In the heat of a full-blown crypto bull market (likely imminent) where NFTs regain their lost hype, I expect more of these types of fees. Marathon controls its own mining pool MARA Pool, runs its own firmware ( MARAFW for optimized mining), is actively involved in the research and design of more efficient mining hardware (like the UCB 2100 replacement control board for BITMAIN Antminers), and is spearheading a next-gen cooling system. This level of involvement in every facet of its operation makes Marathon Digital an all-round vertically integrated Bitcoin miner. From a capacity and financial standpoint, Marathon Digital has recorded expansion and growth. In the Q1 CY24 financial reported a 184% increase in net income at $337 million or $1.26 per diluted share. The MARA management has shown some divergence from their previous strategy of leasing electricity to run mining operations. The company added 516 MW of electricity and now has a total of 1.1 GW capacity, of which it now controls 54% compared to just 3% of electricity control at the end of Q4 last year. This expansion makes the near-term target of 50 exahash by the end of this year much achievable. I believe that the timing of this capacity expansion would be accretive for the company. Risks There remains the possibility that 2PIC may not be adopted as the go-to data center cooling tech in the long run. New iterations of other existing cooling methods, like hydro-cooling, could emerge and prove equally efficient or cost-effective to set up. As reiterated by analysts covering Bitcoin-linked stocks on Seeking Alpha, these stocks exhibit high volatility because they are directly linked to a highly speculative and volatile asset. Investing in Bitcoin stocks comes with an inherent volatility risk. Takeaway Control your own destiny or someone else will. - Jack Welch I believe that Marathon Digital has the potential to achieve an unparalleled level of efficiency compared to peers with this level of all-round vertical integration. Bitcoin has become mainstream and Bitcoin mining is no longer the fledgling industry that it was once considered to be. Miners that control their own business variables through vertical integration have a high competitive advantage over peers at this stage of the market lifecycle. MARA is down about 27% since my last article in January with a ‚Äúhold‚Äù rating. The current stock price is an attractive entry. The post-halving momentum and rally are building up for Bitcoin and this momentum will most likely spread to efficient miners with healthy financial standing like MARA.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4701631-marathon-digital-the-all-round-vertically-integrated-bitcoin-miner?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/30170542.jpeg

As analysts pore over charts and technical indicators, the debate rages on about the future trajectory of DOT. Related Reading: XRP Year-Long Curse Broken? Analyst Bullish On Crypto‚Äôs 240% Rally Bullish Signals Amidst Short-Term Woes For those who place their faith in technical analysis, there is still a glimmer of hope amid Polkadot‚Äôs recent struggles. A descending triangle pattern has emerged on the DOT/USDT chart, historically pointing to a support zone between $5.5 and $6. This area has previously acted as a floor, staving off more severe price declines. #DOTUSDT is currently trading within a well-defined descending triangle pattern with strong support around the $5.5-$6 range. ~ Support Zone: A strong support zone exists between $5.5 and $6, highlighted in green. This area has historically acted as a significant support level,‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/jUSXMqJ9FW ‚Äî Cryptorphic (@Cryptorphic1) June 28, 2024 For a substantial price surge, Polkadot needs to break above the key resistance levels of $7.5 and $11.55, the latter being the peak price earlier this year. If bulls can muscle through these resistance levels, it could trigger a targeted ascension towards the $12 mark. On the flip side, if the price dips below the critical support of $5.5, it could invalidate the current bullish outlook and signal a more prolonged period of decline. Long-Term Vision For Polkadot Despite the recent price fluctuations, Polkadot‚Äôs long-term value proposition remains a beacon of hope for many investors. Polkadot aims to address one of the most significant challenges in the blockchain space‚Äîinteroperability. Interestingly, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is showing bullish divergence‚Äîa scenario where the RSI forms higher lows even as the price continues to fall. This divergence suggests that buying pressure might be building, potentially setting the stage for a price reversal. According to recent price predictions, Polkadot‚Äôs value could see a significant rise of 226%, potentially reaching $19.67 by July 30, 2024. This forecast aligns with a neutral market sentiment and a Fear & Greed Index score of 47, indicating a balanced outlook. Over the past 30 days, Polkadot has recorded 47% green days with an 8.07% price volatility. Related Reading: Solana Poised For Epic Reversal? Analyst Spots Bullish Pattern Echoing 2022 Breakout Yet, investors should look beyond the immediate price movements and consider broader market dynamics. Regulatory scrutiny, competition from other interoperability solutions, and global economic conditions are all factors that can influence Polkadot‚Äôs price. Moreover, assessing the progress of Polkadot‚Äôs development roadmap and its core functionalities can provide deeper insights into the project‚Äôs health and future potential. The crypto market‚Äôs inherent volatility demands careful consideration and a strategic approach to investing in assets like Polkadot. As the market evolves, Polkadot‚Äôs journey will undoubtedly be one to watch, reflecting broader trends and shifts within the blockchain industry.
