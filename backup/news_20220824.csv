This is a result of the Merge announcement that took the space by storm about a month ago. Since then, interest in Ethereum has skyrocketed. But with the decline in price, investors are becoming warier about investing in the market. However, that does not mean that Ethereum is no longer a good buy. The Upcoming Merge For many, the news of the Merge is one that has been a long time in the making. This is why when developers announced that the Merge would be happening sometime around September 15th, the community erupted in joy. But besides just being an important upgrade, the upgrade has also served as a good buy signal for the digital asset. Related Reading: Institutional Investor Sentiment Remains Negative As Bitcoin Outflows Continue Firstly, with the move to proof of stake, Ethereum will consume about 99.95% less energy than it used to. This means that the concern of environmental pollution is eliminated for the digital asset and takes it off the radar of governments who are looking to sanction cryptocurrency mining due to how much energy they consume. ETH recovers above $1,600 | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com Another good reason is the fact that the ETH staked on the Ethereum 2.0 contract will not be automatically released.

42394860,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWE88,1661380965,Crypto Exchange Coinbase to Offer Liquid Staking Token Before Ethereum Merge,"Coinbase (COIN) will offer its own liquid staking token, called Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH (cbETH), ahead of the Ethereum blockchain’s Merge in September, the crypto exchange said in a tweet Wednesday.  The token will be Ethereum-based and, after the Merge, can be used to stake ether (ETH), the native token of the blockchain, through Coinbase, according to the tweet. Liquid staking allows investors to generate extra yield on top of standard rewards for staking or locking coins in a network.  In liquid staking, locked staked assets are “wrapped” into transferable tokens that represent ownership of the underlying staked assets and any rewards earned, Coinbase said in a white paper. The resulting tokens are fully transferable and can be unwrapped to claim the underlying staked assets.  Aside from this liquid token there have been other services that are expected to provide similar services. On July 19, Lido Finance said it will soon offer staked ether on layer 2, or companion, networks, which process transactions faster and more cheaply than the Ethereum mainnet.  Read more: What Is the Ethereum Merge?  The Merge, which is Ethereum’s upgrade from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake, is slated to be finalized at some point between Sept. 10-20. The switch will substantially lower the network’s energy consumption.  Read more: Top Questions About Proof-of-Stake and Staking Answered  Coinbase is hoping to spur massive adoption of the token, which will have several uses after the Merge. “Our hope is that cbETH will achieve robust adoption for trade, transfer, and use in DeFi [decentralized finance] applications,” according to the white paper. “With cbETH, Coinbase aims to contribute to the broader crypto ecosystem through creating high-utility wrapped tokens and open sourcing smart contracts,” the white paper added.  Separately, cbETH investors will be able to exit their staked ETH for cash as well as transfer their staked ETH to another non-custodial wallet, according to the white paper.  Trading of the liquid token will start on Aug. 25, if all liquidity conditions are met, Coinbase said in a tweet thread. Once sufficient supply of this asset is established, trading of cbETH-USD trading pair will begin in phases, the thread added.

42421123,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZUYn,1661378402,Most NFT Projects ‘Convey No Actual Ownership’: Galaxy Digital Research,"Non-fungible token (NFT) holders may not own the intellectual property (IP) rights of the assets they’ve purchased, says Alex Thorn, Galaxy Digital’s head of research.  Thorn, who specializes in development research for the cryptocurrency ecosystem, told CoinDesk TV on Wednesday that “the vast majority of NFT art projects … convey no actual ownership for the underlying content.”  Thorn’s comments reflect a new report from Galaxy Digital, which highlights concerns over NFTs and intellectual property (IP) rights. The report outlines that one of the major problems with NFTs today is that issuers administer them.  Read more: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?  “When you buy one of these tokens … you’re not buying the media that the metadata points to, you’re actually buying a license from an issuer,” Thorn said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover.”  Of the estimated top 25 NFT projects Galaxy Digital considered, the company found that there was only one project, World of Women (WoW), that “even attempts to give true ownership for the underlying artwork,” to token holders. But, according to the report, it is still unclear if the original issuer of a WoW NFT would need to transfer the IP address to a secondary buyer if they were to sell on another marketplace, such as OpenSea.  Even so, because a majority of NFTs “come with a license from the issuer,” the issuer oversees how the license is governed, and ultimately, how token holders can use the content within the license.  Thorn points out this is evident in the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) licensing agreement, which says that when a person purchases an NFT they “own the underlying Board Ape, the Art, completely.”  “That is objectively false,” he said. “The holder of the token does not own the art completely. If they did, Yuga Labs would not need to provide a license to them.”  Thorn argues that token issuers, including Yuga Labs, which is one the largest NFT issuers, may have actually “misled NFT purchasers as to the intellectual property rights for the content they are selling.”  ""The vast majority of these NFTs come with a license from the issuer, right, and a license governs how the token holder can use the content under various circumstances,"" Thorn said. ""Those licenses range from extremely permissive – Yuga Labs is definitely on the forefront of the permissive commercial use license – to highly restrictive, personal use only, you can't even display it in public.""  Thorn suggested one possible solution would be to update what users have rights to when they purchase an NFT.  Read more: NFTs Worth $100M Reported Stolen Over Past Year: Elliptic  More broadly, Thorn notes that this can be a problem for users who are looking to “build something very durable.” He adds that “to be clear, these licenses can be changed, revoked or amended anytime, for no reason at all,” he said. And because issuers still hold IP rights, they can make changes “without even notifying the holders of the token.”  In the last year, the NFT artwork ecosystem has risen meteorically, and is now worth upward of $118 billion in value.  Thorn added that NFTs’ value is less than it was months ago, and issuers could determine whether the industry grows further.  “If you think NFTs are this revolution in digital property rights, which many do, we’re a long way off,” Thorn said.  Responding to a CoinDesk request for comment, a Yuga Labs representative said the company didn't ""have anything to add on this subject at this time.""

The company expects hashrate to rise to 4.1 EH/s by the end of the first quarter of 2023.  Argo was one of the miners that received chip giant Intel’s (INTC) second-generation bitcoin (BTC) mining chip, called “Intel Blockscale ASIC,” which is said to offer miners more efficient rigs than most models available in the market. The company in late April had raised its year-end hashrate guidance to 5.5 EH/s from 3.7 EH/s, expecting timely delivery of the mining rigs.  Miner Hive Blockchain (HIVE) and Griid Infrastructure as well as technology giant Block (formerly Square) were also among the first customers to receive the new Intel Blockscale ASIC.  Argo’s revenue from mining in the first half of the year was $32.5 million, down 14% from the same period last year, mainly due to lower bitcoin prices and an increase in the global hashrate and associated network difficulty. Adjusted EBITDA for the first half of 2022 fell 28% from the year-ago level to $20.9 million.  Shares are down about 4% in post-market action on Wednesday and remain lower by about 60% on a year-to-date basis.

42394873,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWEMt,1661374249,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Rises Slightly Along With Stocks,"Price Action  Bitcoin Rises Slightly Along With Stocks  Bitcoin and other crypto assets rose along with U.S. stocks, which broke a three-day losing streak on Wednesday, as investors' appetite for riskier assets returned.  “Bitcoin is benefitting from a slight risk-on session on Wall Street as stocks try to end a three-day slide,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.  This article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  The S&P 500 rose 0.22% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.52%.  Moving in sync, bitcoin and ether were recently up 1% and 2%, respectively, according to CoinDesk data. Other blockchain-affiliated assets, including Solana’s SOL and Cardano’s ADA rose by about a percentage point.  Investors have been hesitant to commit over the past few days before the U.S. Federal Reserve’s annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where Fed Chair Jerome Powell may offer clues about upcoming monetary policy in a Friday speech.  “We are stuck in consolidation mode before Jackson Hole and that should keep bitcoin supported above the $20,000 level,” Moya said. “Risky assets may be stuck in a range even after Powell's speech on Friday, as not much will be able to deter the Fed's hawkish stance until we get soft inflation [data].”  Powell is expected to give a speech on Friday at 10 a.m. ET that will clarify the central banker’s outlook on inflation over the next couple of months. Traders are also hoping for hints of whether the Fed will hike interest rates by 75 basis points at its next meeting in September, or by 50 basis points. The amount depends on signs inflation is lessening.  New research by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York published Wednesday showed that coronavirus pandemic-induced strong demand was the main driver behind higher U.S. inflation in July, and that without supply chain bottlenecks the inflation rate would have been 6% instead of 9% at the end of 2021.  “In the absence of any new energy or other shock, it is therefore possible that the ongoing easing of supply bottlenecks will cause a substantial drop in inflation in the near term,” the report said.

Featured Story  CoinShares a Good Way to Play the Crypto Recovery, BTIG Analyst Says  By Michael Bellusci  Europe-based digital asset management firm CoinShares (CNSRF) is one of investment company BTIG’s picks for investors to play the recovery across crypto markets along with the growing adoption of digital assets, analyst Mark Palmer told clients in a note Wednesday.  CoinShares, which is Europe's largest digital asset management company, according to BTIG, continues to develop crypto-focused financial products and maintains an edge over peers given the company’s proprietary technology infrastructure, Palmer said.  Palmer says while shares have lagged since the spring, CoinShares’ management is focused on boosting its exposure to physical stakes in exchange-traded funds (ETF) with attractive yields and no management fee.  Sweden-listed CoinShares had about $1.65 billion in assets under management as of June 30, according to its Q2 report.  BTIG gave CoinShares a buy rating and $5.63 price target (SEK60). Shares were trading on Wednesday down 4.6% to $3.76 (SEK39.85), and have declined more than 50% year to date.  Read the full story here.

Armstrong had filed suit against Atozy (real name Erling Mengshoel Jr.) for allegedly defaming him in a Nov. 8 video titled “This YouTuber Scams His Fans … Bitboy Crypto.” When court watchers dug up the suit it spurred an uproar over Armstrong’s business practices.  He said the suit was an attempt to defend his reputation against a video that he said insinuated he will be investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. “I’m not suing someone over their opinion,” he said.  “I didn't understand that my name is now so big that if I file a lawsuit it would be found and be made public,” Armstrong said. The suit had presented Armstrong as emotionally distressed over the video. In his livestream he said he had wanted it removed.  Addressing the alleged crypto rugpull he allegedly “knowingly” promoted, Armstrong said the project he reviewed was not the one that went live, and that he lost money in it along with his followers.

42394865,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWEE2,1661373887,Chipmaker Nvidia’s Crypto Mining Chip Revenue Continues to Fall,"Chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) said its cryptocurrency mining processor (CMP) sales were once again “nominal” for its 2023 fiscal second quarter ended July 31, down from $266 million a year ago. The chipmaker used the same term to describe its CMP sales in the previous quarter, dragging down revenues for its “OEM and Other” business unit.  Nvidia’s said overall second-quarter revenue for the business unit fell 66% to $140 million from the same quarter last year driven by lower notebook OEM sales, according to its chief financial officer’s commentary. The “OEM and Other” unit contributed only about 2% of total second-quarter revenue.  Sales of the CMP unit continued to decline with the price of cryptocurrencies in general. In Nvidia’s fiscal fourth quarter, CMP revenue fell 77% from the previous quarter.  Nvidia’s total second-quarter revenue was $6.7 billion, in line with the consensus estimate of $6.7 billion, according to FactSet. In early August, Nvidia pre-announced lower-than-expected results, saying it expected revenue to come in at $6.7 billion, well short of its previous guidance of $8.1 billion, primarily owing to lower gaming revenue.  Adjusted earnings per share of 51 cents beat consensus estimates of 50 cents. Nvidia also gave fiscal third-quarter sales guidance of $5.90 billion, plus or minus 2%, well short of the consensus estimate of $6.9 billion.  Shares of the chip maker were down about 2.8% to $167.38 in after-hours trading on Wednesday.

42394866,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWEG0,1661373434,Wounded Crypto Traders Desperate for Clues From Fed’s Big Meeting This Week,"Crypto investors have been wounded so badly from recent market declines that they can be forgiven for desperately hoping U.S. Federal Reserve officials attending their annual gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, dangle something – anything – positive about the months ahead.  Bitcoin (BTC) has gotten slammed this year, down 53% in value since New Year’s Eve, according to CoinDesk data. Ether (ETH) has done a hair worse, plunging 54%, though its price recently doubled in the last month amid excitement about the upcoming overhaul of its underlying blockchain consensus protocol known as the Merge.  The carnage in crypto is largely about interest rates, or, more specifically, the Fed’s campaign to tamp down inflation by dramatically hiking them. The importance of inflation to crypto was underscored Friday when bitcoin sank 11% after minutes from the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) July meeting showed central bankers weren’t quite as optimistic about inflation as first perceived by markets – a sign interest rates might have to rise even more.  Read more: US Federal Reserve Minutes Show More Rate Hikes Coming, Concern About Stablecoin Risks  More hawkish comments from Jackson Hole, where the conference runs from Aug. 25-27, could continue the plunge in crypto assets. The broad fear among investors, both crypto and conventional, is that the Fed’s tightening campaign risks driving the economy into a recession. U.S. Treasury bonds – one of the world’s key markets – appear to bolster that concern. Short-term bond yields currently exceed longer-term ones, a yield curve inversion that tends to happen before the economy contracts.  Yet, central bankers and most economists insist that the U.S. economy is not in a recession, and that a soft landing – bringing inflation down without causing a recession – is very much a possibility.  This disconnect has rattled both the crypto and stock markets in recent weeks. Both rallied briefly after Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s last speech in July, which most analysts perceived as dovish. However, prices retreated following the slightly more hawkish FOMC minutes.  High stakes  So the stakes in Jackson Hole are high for Powell and his colleagues to provide clarity for the markets.  “I’m looking forward to seeing if Powell can straighten the market out,” said David Wessel, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution and former Wall Street Journal economics editor. “At a time when the Fed’s public forecast is at odds with the market, he knows that this is his chance to steer the markets.”  Prices in interest-rate futures markets show traders seeing a possibility the Fed will have to undo some of its tightening next year by cutting rates, though central bankers have said multiple times that expectations of rate cuts are “definitely premature.”  This not only shows that there is a strong mismatch between market expectations and Fed statements, but that traders may have a credibility issue with the central bank.  Read more: It Doesn't Matter If They're Wrong, Central Bankers Set Guidance for Crypto, Too  “If the Fed continues to shrink the balance sheet, then basically they’re serious about inflation,” said Dick Bove, chief financial strategist at Odeon Capital Group. “If they don't do that, it doesn't matter what they say – they're not serious.”  The Fed promised to reduce its almost $9 trillion balance sheet in June, but only started the process a little over a week ago by selling Treasury bonds. But both Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities are supposed to be sold by the central bank. Bove sees an issue with the latter.  “I believe [the Fed] will shrink Treasurys but I am very wary about what they might do with the mortgage-backed securities because they could set off a collapse which would be as big as 2008,” he said, referring to the last big recession.  Weakening housing market  New home sales dropped sharply in July and exceeded expectations widely, a report showed Friday, reflecting the effect of the Fed’s interest rate hikes on the housing market. Some economists predict that the worst is ahead, given that inventory is likely to continue rising, which will lead to further declines in home prices in the near term.  That outlook, however, could be positive for crypto, pressuring the Fed to be more dovish, which would result in a weaker U.S. dollar and therefore a stronger crypto market, Joshua Lim, head of derivatives at Genesis Trading said. (Genesis is owned by Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)  Brooking’s Wessel says that the market isn’t “stupid,” and knows that the Fed is going to reduce mortgage-backed securities, but that the question is whether they will try to do more.  “The focus will more be on short-term rates,” he said.  Powell knows that traders will expect the Fed chair to give clear guidance on where the Fed stands on inflation and recession fears, but markets won’t likely glean what FOMC members plan to do in September.  “I think everybody will be looking for hints, so whatever adverb he uses will lead some people to think 50 or 75 basis points. But I think he will try to avoid giving hints,” Wessels said. “I think they're trying to wean the markets off this forward guidance, this thing that everything has to be clear before” FOMC meetings.  Bove agrees and said that the Fed will double down on its belief that inflation is the biggest threat and can only be tamed by increasing rates.  “I think that they keep their mouths shut a little bit more and they just do what needs to be done,” he said.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/08/24/wounded-crypto-traders-desperate-for-clues-from-feds-big-meeting-this-week,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/60ae03a8e5c5c59a9544e34f75c1e0d2a0aa0b1a-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Like crypto exchange giant FTX, Alameda was started by Sam Bankman-Fried, and the company operates a vast network of trading, yield farming, startup investments and market making.  Fellow co-CEO Caroline Ellison will remain as the company’s sole CEO, Trabucco wrote.  Trabucco said in a tweet thread that he had significantly reduced his role at Alameda over the past few months, noting he reached a point in life where had to “prioritize other things” such as his personal life. “I needed to relax,” he added, and I’m really, really happy.”  Trabucco said he doesn't currently have any other crypto projects lined up, ""but I wouldn't rule anything out in the future once I feel more 'recovered.'""  Bankman-Fried initially ceded leadership of Alameda to Trabucco and Ellison in October. The two both had pre-crypto ties to Bankman-Fried, who started Alameda in 2017 to exploit crypto arbitrage opportunities. He hired Ellison, who worked with him at Jane Street, in 2018, and Trabucco, a Susquehanna bond trader and friend from MIT, a year later.  FTX didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

And it&apos;s fast approaching.Almost 40% of HIVE&apos;s mining production comes from Ethereum mining. Ethereum changing from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake eliminates that revenue source.HIVE&apos;s post-merge strategy is a shift to other GPU mineable coins and computing services.HIVE&apos;s crypto-specific options for the GPUs are very limited.One of the biggest narrative trades in crypto since the market stopped going down in mid-June has been the renewed optimism in a merge of Ethereum&apos;s (ETH-USD) proof of work mainnet and proof of stake Beacon Chain; now scheduled for mid-September. But a slightly underappreciated component of moving from proof of work to proof of stake consensus is the miners who were previously securing the PoW network no longer have the same incentive in a PoS model because the transaction validation mechanism is completely different.For Ethereum miners, this is particularly problematic because ETH mining is still done with GPUs rather than with the ASIC machines required by most other PoW networks. Ethereum miners can&apos;t simply switch to securing Bitcoin (BTC-USD) because their machines aren&apos;t capable of profitably mining it. Some of the ETH miners are now upset about the change to a PoS model, and there is a proposed fork of Ethereum that is reportedly picking up a little bit of steam.

After this, the Terminal Total Difficulty (TTD) value triggering the Merge will be 58,750,000,000,000,000,000,000. That TTD expected to be reached somewhere between Sept. 10 and Sept. 20.

After launching in 2017, ADA did not experience much upwards price movement until the beginning of 2021. The token rose from $0.2 to above $2 before correcting to the $1 mark in July 2021. However, Cardano made headlines after integrating its Alonzo fork upgrade - which deployed smart contracts on the blockchain network for the first time. After the deployment went live in September 2021, ADA reached an all-time high of $3.1 in the same months. But, ADA has corrected to $0.5 per token. Despite being one of the largest cryptocurrencies, the token has not provided any upwards movement in 2022. Therefore, a 2x increase to $1 is unlikely.

The company behind the dollar-pegged stablecoin USDT said it will not bar addresses associated with Tornado Cash until the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) says otherwise. Freezing any such addresses, noted Tether, could be “highly disruptive and reckless,” and impede current regulatory investigations.  Earlier this month, the U.S. agency blacklisted the crypto-mixer Tornado Cash, claiming that North Korean hackers were using the protocol to conduct illicit transactions. The Treasury Dept. specified that the use of the protocol or Ethereum addresses on the protocol would be prohibited.  Notably, Circle – the issuer of stablecoin USDC – blacklisted Tornado Cash smart contracts within hours of the sanctioning. “We believe that, if made without instructions from U.S. authorities, the move by USDC … was premature and might have jeopardized the work of other regulators and law enforcement agencies around the world,” said Tether.

Erling Mengshoel Jr., aka Atozy, has said that once that withdrawal is formalized, he will be returning all donations made to his legal defense fund.  On Aug. 12, crypto influencer Ben Armstrong, aka “BitBoy Crypto,” filed a lawsuit against YouTuber Erling Mengshoel Jr., aka Atozy. In the suit BitBoy claims that Atozy’s November 2021 video titled “This Youtuber Scams His Fans … Bitboy Crypto” caused him harm, including damage to his business and “infliction of emotional distress.” BitBoy, who had been widely accused of unethical and irresponsible behavior long before Atozy’s video, seeks $75,000 in restitution.  This was, unambiguously, an extremely ill-advised move, and it is blowing up in BitBoy’s face in a truly poetic manner.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Coverage of the lawsuit, almost all of it relentlessly negative towards BitBoy, has had far wider reach than Atozy’s original video. BitBoy is reaping the fallout of what’s become known as “the Streisand Effect,” when attempts to hide or suppress information have the opposite impact.  In this case, the information BitBoy would like to suppress is that he’s really terrible at his purported “job” of evaluating cryptocurrency projects for his YouTube followers. Atozy’s original video was focused on BitBoy’s promotion of Pamp Network, whose crypto, PAMP, would supposedly “only go up in price,” yet somehow dropped to zero soon after BitBoy’s endorsement. Crypto sleuth ZachXBT found back in January that a huge proportion of BitBoy-endorsed projects had lost immense value even before the current bear market downturn, quite likely costing his viewers serious amounts of money.  But that’s not just because BitBoy is bad at picking cryptos. He’s also deeply unethical, and quite possibly an outright criminal. ZachXBT revealed in January that many of BitBoy’s videos were not neutral evaluations of tokens, but undisclosed promotions paid for by the token creators themselves. This kind of “touting” is considered a form of fraud, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has regularly pursued violators under securities law. (BitBoy has since claimed he now discloses all paid promotions.)  See also: 5 Social Media Crypto Scams to Avoid  So it’s all the more delicious to watch BitBoy’s little tantrum explode in his face like an Acme bomb.  Far from quashing or discouraging them, the lawsuit has taken allegations against BitBoy mainstream. Most dramatically, attacks on BitBoy are now spreading on YouTube far more widely than before the lawsuit. Atozy’s original video, posted in November 2021, had a little over 180,000 views at this writing – a respectable but not huge reach. But four days ago, the lawsuit was covered by Cr1TiKaL, aka Charles White Jr., a YouTuber with 11.2 million followers and all the mercy of a professional assassin.  “I’m not here to make any allegations,” CrITiKaL said of BitBoy. “I’m just here to make fun of him.”  That video already has 1.3 million views, roughly seven times as many as Atozy’s. And that’s just one reaction. It seems clear that BitBoy’s own lawsuit is turning him from a derided figure within the crypto industry into a mainstream punching bag.  Cr1TiKaL sums up the dynamic brilliantly in his reaction: “Every once in a while some pathetic, stinky worm decides it’s a good idea to try and legally strong-arm a YouTuber they don’t like … I always find it comical, because it never works out in their favor. … BitBoy’s lawsuit has done significantly more damage than Atozy could have ever done. Angrily filing a frivolous lawsuit on the internet is like publicly guillotining yourself. It’s reputational suicide.”  As if to pour salt on BitBoy’s wounded ego, Atozy has since put out a call for donations to fund his legal defense … and has already raised immensely more money than BitBoy sought in his original suit. Atozy has, at this writing, raised the following:  More than $50,000 through GoFundMe  About $1,800 in bitcoin (BTC)  $18,000 in ether (ETH) donations  Over $10,000 in tether (USDT)  More than $105,000 in USDC (this was largely donated by crypto industry commentator @Cobie)  Grand Total: more than $184,000. If that seems like a lot for defense against a frivolous $75,000 nuisance lawsuit, it is. But feel free to donate more: Atozy has said he will pass any excess along to the highly reputable crypto policy group Coin Center.

42394863,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWED3,1661359063,"Crypto Lender Voyager Can Pay Employees 'Retention' Bonuses, US Judge Rules","A federal judge ruled that crypto lender Voyager Digital, which is undergoing bankruptcy proceedings, can pay more than 30 employees a collective $1.6 million as a ""retention"" award.  Judge Michael Wiles also agreed to seal the names and titles of the employees who may receive the bonuses.  Voyager filed for the authorization earlier this month, a move that Voyager's organized creditors opposed this past Friday. The U.S. Trustee's Office, a bankruptcy watchdog operating under the auspices of the Department of Justice, also objected to the potential recipients' names and titles being redacted, suggesting in its own filing that they may not be eligible for this type of bonus.  ""This program does not involve the senior management team, and data about these individuals would typically not exist in the public domain. We note that no creditor or shareholder or economic stakeholder has objected to the motion to seal. We provided this information to the UCC [Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors], which was the only party to ask us for it and the United States Trustee's office. The information has not been withheld from anyone who asked for it,"" said Michael Slade, an attorney with Kirkland & Ellis representing Voyager, during the hearing.  Richard Morrissey, an attorney with the U.S. Trustee's office, called Voyager's concerns ""speculative,"" saying hundreds of customers have asked his office questions about the process, including whether executives would receive a bonus.  Voyager originally filed to pay 38 employees a collective $1.9 million, but some employees have since left, Slade said.  Slade said the company planned to implement cost-cutting measures over the next month, which would result in an annualized savings of $4.6 million.  Darren Azman, an attorney with McDermott Will & Emery representing the UCC, said one of the creditors' main concerns is cost reduction, but Voyager's concession in announcing the annualized savings address that concern.  During the hearing one creditor, who claimed she lost over $450,000, questioned the idea that Voyager's leadership could still draw a salary, though the judge pointed out this wasn't part of the current motion.",NEUTRAL,없음,OTHER,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/08/24/crypto-lender-voyager-can-pay-employees-retention-bonuses-us-judge-rules,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/af7a2e40e9a1add959440c743fb08028d1a4b559-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""This is a cash transaction, so there is a high risk of money laundering,"" it said in a post on its website. There is a ""significant risk"" in this transaction that the bitcoin ""may be derived from criminal activity.""  ""Under regulation 33 of the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds Regulations 2017, you must apply enhanced due diligence (EDD) measures dictated by the level of risk and obligations on source of wealth and source of funds.""

Pertsev, 29, was arrested Aug. 10 on the orders of the Dutch authorities, just two days after the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned the currency mixing service, which it linked to over $1 billion in illicit transactions and to North Korean hackers.  The arrest has generated consternation from the Web3 community, which has warned it could have a chilling effect on those developing open-source software, and on those who have legitimate reasons to use mixers, which keep crypto transactions private.  Read more: Tornado Cash Sanctions Are Spiraling Into Compliance Nightmares  Pertsev, based in Amsterdam, was first brought before an examining judge on Aug. 12, who agreed he should be held in custody for an initial period of two weeks.  At a closed-door hearing in Den Bosch, the Netherlands, held Wednesday, Pertsev’s lawyers sought for him to be offered bail. That request was rejected by the judge, but the court nonetheless set an 90-day time limit within which an initial public hearing must take place, a spokesperson for the Dutch courts told CoinDesk. Pertsev has still not been formally charged with any crime.  FIOD, the Dutch authority responsible for probing financial crime, started its probe into Tornado Cash in June, saying that the decentralized service does little to check whether funds are of criminal origin. Campaigners have said the arrest threatens to kill open-source software, as developers would effectively be held responsible for how their code is subsequently used.  In the U.S., Congressman Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) has also questioned the action by Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control, which targets software rather than the people or entities who are more usually the target of sanctions.

Since the weekend, the prices have jumped by 12% resulting in the $106 breakout. But, will this uptrend continue to reach the overhead resistance at $135? Key Points: The ROSE price trend shines a bullish trend reversal hope after a 40% drop. The 100-day SMA helps the bullish trend resurface after the sharp fall. With a market cap of $369 billion, the intraday trading volume of Oasis Network has increased by 1.88% to reach $60.12 million. Source - Tradingview ROSE Technical Analysis After a remarkable 150% jump with a trendline breakout, as mentioned in our previous article, the ROSE prices take a bearish turnaround. With the increased selling pressure about the $0.10 psychological mark, the correction phase results in a 40% decline in the market value. However, the falling prices take a bullish reversal from the 100-day SMA with a morning star pattern. This increases the likelihood of a recovery rally reaching the height of $0.85. Unfortunately for buyers, the lack of any spike in the intraday trading volume lower is the possibility of an uptrend. Hence it is possible that the ROSE prices may start the prevailing downtrend from $0.080.

Data from Arcane Research shows that the current crypto bear market looks very similar to the 2018 bear market.  Market Moves: After a big market plunge, CME bitcoin futures just traded at the largest discount to spot prices in at least 2 1/2 years, with August contracts set to expire this week. Comments by Fed Chair Jerome Powell at the U.S. central bank symposium in Wyoming on Friday could move markets.  Chart of the Day: Bitcoin holds trendline support.  This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price point  Bitcoin (BTC) was trading down on the day while U.S. index futures and European stocks struggled for direction as the global economy is increasingly at risk of sliding into recession.  Ether (ETH), the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, was trading up 2% over the last 24 hours alongside other altcoins. Ether has significantly outperformed bitcoin over the past couple of months, with its market share of the total cryptocurrency market rising above 20% seven days ago.  Among altcoin movers this morning, Cosmo’s ATOM was up 3.7%, unes sed eo (LEO) was ahead 3.5% and quant network (QNT) was higher by 3%.  Data from Arcane Research shows the current bear market is tracking the 2018 bear market.  Bitcoin’s drawdown this time around has lasted for 286 days (nine to 10 months) so far, according to the team at Arcane, and the crypto’s market cap is now down 70% from its all-time high hit in November 2021.  In the 2018 bear market (and in 2014 as well), bottoms occurred 12-13 months after the bear markets began, with maximum drawdowns of 84%-85%, said Arcane, noting that similar timing this time around would mean a bottom forming near the end of this year.  Another similarity to 2018, said Arcane, is a prolonged duration of compressed volatility.  Back then, bitcoin saw a 140-day period with prices in the $6,000-$7,000 range before a final selling climax down towards $3,000, with prices residing in that area for another 120 days. “Similar tendencies are evident today,” noted Arcane, “with prices having ranged in the lower $20,000 area for 70 days.”  “Still, the market is a different beast this time around,” concluded Arcane, likely referring to the far more developed and important cryptocurrency markets today versus past cycles.  In the news, the liquidators of Three Arrows Capital (3AC) secured a crucial court decision in Singapore, which will give them the ability to probe the local assets of the defunct crypto hedge fund, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.  Michelle Bond – one of the most prominent cryptocurrency advocates in this year’s U.S. congressional races – lost her bid to be the Republican candidate for her New York district.  And finally, Latin American crypto company Ripio has started rolling out a prepaid debit card in Brazil that allows payments to be made in cryptocurrency and earns cashback rewards in bitcoin.  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Terra LUNA +4.5% Smart Contract Platform Gala GALA +3.5% Entertainment Cosmos ATOM +3.2% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Dogecoin DOGE −0.1% Currency  Market Moves  Exchange Giant CME’s Bitcoin Futures Just Hit a Huge Discount to Spot Prices  Bitcoin (BTC) futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, one of the world’s biggest derivatives markets, just traded at the largest discount to spot prices in at least 2 1/2 years after a big market plunge and right before August contracts expire.  Arcane Research keeps tabs on the average difference between CME’s front-month bitcoin futures – those expiring soonest – and the current market price for bitcoin itself for rolling one-month periods. On Monday, that showed front-month futures at a 3.36% discount. That’s a record low in the firm’s dataset that goes back to Jan. 1, 2020 – though CME bitcoin futures have been trading since December 2017.  That surpassed the previous low of minus 2.39% set on July 21, 2021, which was followed by a hefty short squeeze, according to Arcane.  CME futures have traded at a discount over the last two months but witnessed a short-lived recovery at the start of the month when there was some momentum in the market. Early in August, bitcoin briefly reached $25,000. But it sank below $21,000 on Aug. 19.  “The growing discounts in the front-month contracts might be explained in part by structural effects,” Vetle Lunde, an analyst at Arcane Research, said in a report.  The report said the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) has begun rolling its August contracts into contracts that expire later, possibly causing downward pressure on the front-month contracts. Monday, BITO rolled over 1,000 August contracts and will roll over a further 3,000 August contracts by Friday. Previous times when the exchange-traded fund rolled over exposures, front-month contracts have tended to move toward discounts to spot, according to Arcane.  “Still, such extreme discounts have not appeared during previous rolling periods,” Lunde said. “They might be a symptom of worsening liquidity or general de-risking as S&P 500 and Nasdaq see a tumultuous start to the week while the dollar strength index pushes towards new highs.”  Chart of the Day  Bitcoin Holds Trendline Support  By Omkar Godbole  The trendline rising from July 18 and July 13 lows is offering support to bitcoin.  A breakdown would expose the July low of $17,567 (Coinbase prices).  Friday's bearish marubozu candle suggests the path of least resistance is to the downside.  The bearish marubozu candle comprises big body and little-to-no wicks, indicating seller dominance.

42394859,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWE97,1661343948,Anomalous Ether Futures Pricing Condition Is Likely to Revert After the Merge,"Ether (ETH) proponents would like all price indicators to flash bullish signals as Ethereum's long-pending upgrade, dubbed ""the Merge,"" nears.  The futures market, however, has slipped into backwardation, an abnormal condition in which futures trade below spot prices, indicating expectations the cryptocurrency will weaken in coming months.  At press time, one-month ether futures listed on major exchanges traded at an annualized discount of 8% to 10% while the three-month futures traded at a discount of around 5%, according to data tracked by analytics firm Skew.  The condition could be short-lived, some observers say, and futures will probably flip back to trading at a premium – a situation known as contango – after the upgrade. That's the usual market position, which reflects the time value of money. The merge, slated to happen in mid-September, will combine Ethereum's current proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain with the proof-of-stake (PoS) Beacon Chain that went live in December 2020. The change is likely to reduce supply of the cryptocurrency, providing an extra boost to the price.  ""The current state of backwardation reflects the general market view that ETH will fall following the Merge, but this could be short-lived,"" Katie Talati, director of research at Arca, said. ""We think ether's real price appreciation will happen after the Merge, driven by increasing ETH locked up staking/securing the chain.""  Trading giant Cumberland says the Merge will remove $40 million worth of miner selling from the market and lead to a 90% drop in annual issuance. Furthermore, the annualized yield on staking, or locking, coins in the network is projected to double to at least 8% from the current 4%, a jump that's likely to fuel staking and suck a considerable amount of ether from the market. Staking yield is the return investors earn for locking coins in a network and is analogous to investing in bonds.  The switch to PoS will require validators to stake a minimum number of coins to validate transactions in return for rewards. Under PoW mechanisms, miners solve a computational problem to verify transactions and tend to liquidate the coins received as rewards to fund their operations.  Merge-focused trades  ""We are experiencing backwardation as a result of investors buying ETH spot and shorting the ETH futures in order to collect the ETH PoW airdrop expected at the time of the merge, essentially isolating ETH price risk for the ""free"" dividend,"" Arca's Talati said.  Some Ethereum miners have pushed back against the blockchain's transition, proposing to split the main Ethereum chain and continue the current PoW chain post-Merge. If that occurs, ETH holders will shift to Ethereum's new PoS chain and also receive the forked ETH PoW tokens for free.  The chance of getting free tokens has prompted traders to initiate basis trades that involve buying ether in the spot market and selling or shorting futures contracts. That means they're positioned to collect any free tokens from a potential chain split while bypassing ether price risks.  ""The futures market will likely go into contango as traders unwind shorts after the Merge,"" said Shiliang Tang, chief investment officer at digital asset investment firm LedgerPrime.  Cumberland said in a recently published report about the merge and the market structure, ""This market anomaly [backwardation] will not persist for long, especially if the merge proves successful and stokes a broader rally.""  Constant sellers?  Some observers say the Merge will bring constant sellers to the futures market. So while pricing may return to contango, premiums could remain depressed relative to bitcoin (BTC), all else being equal.  According to Cumberland, staked ether will remain locked until Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-4788 releases them. That date is not yet known. So, ether stakers, who are exposed to price declines, are likely to sell futures, keeping premiums in check. The popularity of staking depends on yields, and the greater the yield, the stronger the demand for ether staking and selling ether futures.  ""Ether will have PoS yield attached to it after the Merge and stakers will be unable to unstake coins for months. Therefore, there will be demand to sell futures/forwards on ETH to hedge ETH,"" said Joshua Lim, head of derivatives at CoinDesk sister company Genesis Global Trading.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | FORKS,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/08/24/anomalous-ether-futures-pricing-condition-is-likely-to-revert-after-the-merge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b1a4149418cacd71aac6480d900fb6eb68839123-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This bull run accounted for a 64% growth from the June 30th low of $0.022. However, with the recent sell-off in the crypto market, altcoin reverted from the mentioned resistance and triggered a bearish pullback. So should you grab this dip opportunity? Key Points: The cup and handle pattern governs the XDC price action. The 50-day SMA flipped to a viable support level. With a market cap of $318.7 million, the intraday trading volume of XDC has dropped by 21.4% to reach $8.696 million. Source - Tradingview XDC Technical Analysis The V-top reversal from $0.0365 resistance tumbled the prices by 22.8%, hitting the combined support zone of $0.028 and 0.618 Fibonacci retracements. On August 23rd, the XDC price witnessed a significant inflow resulting in an 18% price jump. The massive bullish candle breached the immediate resistance of $0.0312, suggesting the continuation of the prevailing recovery. However, today the coin is 7.5% down, and testing pierced resistance is for suitable support.

42373986,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWgz5,1661340803,"Tron Consumes 99.9% Less Power Than Bitcoin and Ethereum, Crypto Researcher Says","Low power requirements of the Tron network make it one of the most environmentally friendly blockchains, the Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute (CCRI) said in a report on Wednesday. CCRI is a research group focused on lowering carbon emissions for crypto projects.  Tron’s delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism contributed to its reduced carbon footprint as compared to other mechanisms such as Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW), the report said. DPoS relies on users who stake their native TRX tokens to nodes, which validate transactions and maintain the network.  The report was commissioned by the Tron Foundation, which develops products for and maintains the Tron blockchain. CCRI tracks over 20 networks and publishes reports on their sustainability and overall ecological damage – which is a concern cited by several crypto skeptics.  The energy consumption of PoW blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, is over 83 million kilowatts per hour (kWh) and 22 million kWh, respectively. However, Ethereum is scheduled to shift to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism in mid-September after ""The Merge.""  In comparison, Tron had a yearly energy consumption of 162,868 kWh for over 2.31 billion transactions, or roughly 99.9% less than the power consumed by Bitcoin and Ethereum. This pegged Tron’s energy consumption as “equal to the energy consumption of 15 average U.S. households,” as per CCRI.  A key reason for the large amounts of energy consumed by PoW blockchains is their validation requirements.  To validate PoW networks, users need a computer or hardware device that can solve complex algorithmic problems, such as the SHA-256 hashing function with Bitcoin and Keccak-256 with Ethereum, using powerful computers which consume a lot of power to run, maintain and cool.  As such, a previous report by CCRI touted blockchain network Polkadot as having the least carbon footprint, with Cardano using the lowest energy per node per year and Solana the lowest electricity per transaction.  Meanwhile, CCRI said that while PoS networks use so little energy that other factors should be given more attention when evaluating them.  “For practitioners selecting a PoS blockchain protocol, other factors such as decentralization, network throughput and functionality (e.g., smart contracts) should play a vital role as decision criteria,” the research body said.",POSITIVE,없음,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | RESEARCH,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/08/24/tron-consumes-999-less-power-than-bitcoin-and-ethereum-crypto-researcher-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/64e039cef061cac64734e51bbfdda7005a1e5961-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393793,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpAzyD,1661340600,Ethereum Proof-of-Work Forks: Gift or Grift?,"Ethereum is finally set to embark on its long-awaited transition to proof-of-stake. With this major update slated to happen sometime next month, controversy and questions abound around what will happen to the deprecated proof-of-work network post-Merge.  In spite of the fact that the “Ice Age” is supposed to freeze out PoW miners with its “difficulty bomb,” there is a growing movement to keep Ethereum’s old consensus mechanism alive.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Ethereum Classic  In 2016, Ethereum’s community was in crisis. An exploiter ran away with around 5% of all ether (ETH) in circulation, and the nascent ecosystem was gripped by controversy: How should Ethereum proceed? The result was a “hard fork” – a backwards-incompatible code change that created a new instance of the network – one where token balances were adjusted as if the infamous “The DAO exploit” never happened.  But not everyone was on board. A subset of anti-fork purists – along with some of Ethereum’s chief trolls and detractors – continued to operate the old, hack-tainted chain under the moniker of “Ethereum Classic.” The spin-off chain was hollowed out of its community, but it nonetheless vied with its sister network to be the true heir to the Ethereum throne. And it may have gotten close to its goal: ETC, the version of ether (ETH) on the Classic network, briefly seemed like it might flip ETH in value.  Ethereum Classic’s bid for blockchain dominance ultimately failed, but it nonetheless set the stage for years of grifts, confusion and debate.  And now, history repeats.  On Sept. 15 (or thereabouts) Ethereum will finally, at long last, they swear this time, initiate its transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) system. The much-postponed upgrade, which has been on Ethereum’s roadmap since its inception, will dramatically cut the chain’s carbon footprint in favor of a new system that proponents hope will also make the network more secure.  But not everyone is excited for PoS. Some of Ethereum’s miners – those who run computers to process and validate transactions on the current proof-of-work (PoW) network – plan to keep the old network up and running.  Read more: Who Will Mine Ethereum After It’s Gone?  Without Ethereum’s users and core developers, this forked network will be a crypto “uncanny valley.” It will look and feel like Ethereum, but it will only be a skeleton of the real thing, with apps and tokens floating around without usage or value.  Things will break. Grifters will grift. But the movement behind a forked PoW Ethereum appears inevitable.  Why proof-of-work?  The virtues of PoS over Ethereum’s current PoW consensus mechanism are a matter of heated debate. We won’t get into the nitty-gritty of that debate here, but the essential part to understand is that a consensus mechanism is the set of rules by which nodes – the computers operating Ethereum’s blockchain – process transactions.  As long as they meet certain requirements, computers can compete to issue blocks of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. As a reward for doing so, they receive a payout, typically a mix of transaction fees and an allotment of newly issued crypto.  PoW and PoS differ in how they select who can issue blocks. PoW, the system spearheaded by Bitcoin and currently used by Ethereum, accomplishes this task using “miners.” For the privilege of adding the next block to the chain, miners compete to solve a kind of cryptographic puzzle – basically a race to find some random number.  PoS forgoes mining and instead passes the responsibility of block-issuance to so-called validators. One can become a validator by locking up 32 ether as a “stake” on the Ethereum blockchain. The more ether one stakes, the more likely one will be randomly selected to issue the next block.  PoS advocates say PoW is energy-inefficient and biases control of the network to companies who can afford to run expensive, mining-optimized computers called ASICs. PoW adherents say PoS is less proven than PoW and holds its own centralization and security risks.  Whatever the inherent advantages and disadvantages of each system, Ethereum, if all goes to plan, will switch to PoS come September. But what’s to happen to all the PoW miners who invested in that fancy mining hardware? And what about those who think that PoW, despite its flaws, is more secure than PoS?  Not everyone with a vested (or ideological) interest in PoW Ethereum plans to give up on the old mechanism. And why should they? This is crypto, and where some see a fork, others see dollar signs.  Forked consensus  Prominent crypto personalities including Justin Sun and Chandler Guo have both announced their intent to support Ethereum PoW forks, and crypto exchanges like FTX and Sun-backed Poloniex say they will allow users to trade forked ether tokens.  Rather than a single piece of software, Ethereum – a network of computers – is better thought of as a nation-state, with a set of rules governing how it operates. If a bunch of people agree on changing the rules, the entire network doesn’t suddenly “update.” They’ll need to convince other people to jump on board.  Sometimes, these rule changes lead to a fork, where two (or more) new networks spring up with slight operational differences – each supported by some subset of the community.  At a high level, the PoW forks described by Sun and Guo will be exact duplicates of the main Ethereum chain, where the “state” of the original chain – meaning transaction history and token balances – is preserved.  At the moment of the Merge to PoS, users will suddenly have access to two (or more) different blockchains with identical token balances and smart contracts (the mini computer programs that run on Ethereum’s blockchain).  But does a forked Ethereum mean all of your money will suddenly double (or triple, or quadruple, depending on the number of forks)? No, not really.  Tokens are only worth as much as the market dictates. Certain tokens – particularly the ether used to pay for transaction fees – could have some value on PoW forks. Plus, crypto’s meme-driven markets are no stranger to baseless speculation.  But not all of the apps and services built atop Ethereum’s soon-to-be-PoS network will support PoW forks, and in most cases, the lack of active community support will break the mechanism by which tokens derive their ostensible value.  Take, for instance, stablecoins like USDT and USDC – neither of which appear likely to receive support on PoW Ethereum forks.  These tokens are core to Ethereum’s decentralized finance ecosystem owing to the fact that they are, unlike the volatile ethers and bitcoins of the world, “pegged” to the price of $1. They trade at this price because their issuing authorities claim to have $1 in the bank for every digital dollar they put into circulation.  You cannot merely duplicate your balance of USDC and USDT onto a new blockchain. The 1:1 backing will only exist for the officially recognized instance of a digital dollar – the one that exists on the canonical, soon-to-be-PoS blockchain. As such, holding USDC or USDT on an Ethereum PoW fork will be like holding counterfeit money.  The lack of stablecoin support on Ethereum PoW forks will have broad consequences for the ability of other forked tokens to retain value. USDC and USDT are used as collateral throughout DeFi. If and when these tokens on the PoW chain stop trading at $1, they’ll set off a cascading effect that will – in combination with other factors – render most other forked tokens virtually worthless.  Ethereum’s PoW forks will, at least initially, be like China’s vast ghost cities – the foundations will be there, but absent any signs of life.  ETH POW: Gift or grift?  So why would anyone breathe life into an empty, copycat blockchain?  Kevin Zhou of Galois Capital has been one of the loudest voices on Twitter predicting that PoW forks will proliferate after Ethereum’s Merge to PoS.  In a podcast interview with crypto journalist and author Laura Shin, Zhou explained, “There’s really two classes of incentives.”  “The first,” said Zhou, “is pure grift.”  “Someone could just make a fork – they know it's probably not going to work, and they don’t plan to support it. They’re just going to get some free coins … and then just dump them,” Zhou told Shin.  Hasu, a researcher at Ethereum infrastructure firm Flashbots and prominent voice in crypto circles, has called the idea of Ethereum PoW forks that duplicate the original chain’s ledger a “completely stupid idea.”  “Crypto is full of bad projects that only exist to dump on retail,” he tweeted, “but that doesn't make it OK to support them. [T]he fact that ghost chains like ETC [Ethereum Classic] still exist does not vindicate that point.”  But Zhou – in contrast to Hasu and most of the wider crypto community – doesn’t think all PoW forks will be thinly veiled cash grabs.  Ethereum miners raked in over $600 million last month in rewards and transaction fees. If miners want to put their expensive hardware to use on a new chain, Zhou thinks they could do worse than an Ethereum PoW fork.  “There’s a lot of infrastructure that somebody built out. Nobody’s operating it, but there’s a lot of infrastructure still there. Is that better than other [layer 1 blockchains]? Is that better than Ethereum Classic? I think you can make a good argument that it is,” Zhou said.  Speaking at the ETH Seoul conference earlier this month, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin waved away concerns that PoW Ethereum forks – grift or not – might eat into activity on Ethereum’s PoS mainnet.  Describing “pretty much everyone” in the Ethereum community as “unified” around the switch to PoS, Buterin pointed to his one-time-nemesis, Ethereum Classic, which will remain PoW, as “the superior product for people with those pro-proof-of-work values and preferences.”  Buterin’s about-face on the early Ethereum fork shows just how small a threat it has become in the years following its divisive introduction.  Ethereum Classic has seen recent investment from miners who think it will attract PoW adherents after Ethereum ditches PoS, but activity on the problem-prone chain pales in comparison to the rest of Ethereum.  Whatever your view on PoW, what happens next will be confusing, and it may even be entertaining, but – if the example of Ethereum Classic is anything to go by – it is unlikely to mean much for Ethereum as a whole.

Australian gambling regulations are primarily state-level, not federal, in nature. NTRC Regulates Gaming and Betting The Northern Territory Racing Commission regulates all wagering and betting businesses that opt to obtain a license there, including major international bookmakers like Betfair, Entain Group, Draft Kings, and Sportsbet. The NTRC has given licensees a secret document asking for their opinions on how the regulatory environment would appear to allow crypto wagering to take off in the Northern Territory (NT). The private document has been made available to Julian Hoskins, the principal of Senet, leading gambling law and regulatory advisory company in Australia. Hoskins further mentioned that strict identification procedures have also been considered by Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulation. Monthly Cryptocurrency Deposit Limits Hoskins further stated that for the first 12 months, the NTRC had suggested monthly crypto deposit limits of 2,000 Australian dollars, or roughly $1,300, with a maximum wager of 5,000 Australian dollars, or approximately $3,500, every month.

The long-wick candles indicate the possibility of a trend reversal. But will the buyers exceed the opposing 50-day SMA that gain bearish momentum? Key Points: The DOT market price regains bullish trend momentum teasing a bull run shortly. The crucial daily SMAs of 50, 100, and 200-day gains bearish momentum after the recent downfall. With a market cap of $8.35 billion, the intraday trading volume of Polkadot has increased by 7% to reach $345 million. Source - Tradingview DOT Technical Analysis The bullish reversal in the DOT prices formed a rising wedge in the daily chart accounting for a price jump of 43% between 25th July and 14th August. After that, however, the prices took a bearish turnaround from the 100-day SMA and the overhead resistance trendline resulting in a bearish breakout. The correction phase breaks below the 50-day SMA and accounts for a 25% price fall within a fortnight. The buyers, however, at $7, cushioned the downfall resulting in low price rejection candles and bouncing the prices higher. A bearish influence over the daily candle accounts for a 1.57% drop, but the lack of trading volume projects the possibility of a bullish turnaround.

The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia in Atlanta.

The Singapore High Court granted the request of Three Arrows Capital's appointed liquidator, Teneo, on Monday. This means that the court now legally recognizes the liquidation order originally filed in the British Virgin Islands.  Bloomberg reported the development earlier citing people familiar with the matter.  Recognition in Singapore gives Teneo the freedom to request all financial records held locally, this includes bank accounts, cryptocurrencies, stakes in companies and properties, the report said. In July, Three Arrows co-founder Su Zhu was reportedly looking to sell one of his homes in Singapore worth $35 million.  The fall of the hedge fund was part of a wider crypto contagion that swept across the entire industry. In May, algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST) collapsed alongside the LUNA ecosystem, Three Arrows had exposure to the ecosystem and Su Zhu described the episode as ""humbling"".  After Terra's collapse, crypto lenders like Celsius Network and Voyager Digital filed for bankruptcy while several firms were forced to halt withdrawals as the liquidity crunch gripped the crypto markets.  The high court order states any parties with information in connection to ""the promotion, formation, business, dealings, affairs, property, rights, obligations or liabilities of Three Arrows Capital"" have a duty to cooperate with the liquidators as if they would if the hedge fund were a ""Singapore-incorporated company in liquidation in Singapore.""  Partners from New York-based Teneo Restructuring have gained control of at least $40 million of Three Arrow Capital's assets so far. This represents a small fraction of creditor claims, which are estimated to be at least $2.8 billion, according to a 1,157-page court filing published in July.  The founders of Three Arrows Capital broke their silence shortly after the court filing was released, with Su Zhu and Kyle Davies describing the collapse as ""regrettable.""

42373989,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWh1b,1661309535,Crypto Booster Bond Loses Primary Bid for New York Congressional Seat,"Michelle Bond – one of the most prominent cryptocurrency advocates in this year’s U.S. congressional races – lost her bid to be the Republican candidate for her New York district.  Bond, who secured less than 30% of the vote in the Tuesday election, runs the Association for Digital Asset Markets, one of the groups pushing a crypto-friendly agenda in Washington, D.C. Despite heavy industry support, she joins several other crypto-friendly candidates to lose in congressional primaries as the consequential midterm elections head toward their conclusion later this year. Republican Nick LaLota will fight Democrat Bridget Fleming for the House seat in the November general election.  Had she won the Republican-leaning district in eastern Suffolk County, Long Island, Bond’s chances would have been good to survive the general election to make it to Congress next year. The House will likely be considering legislation in the next session that could fundamentally change how digital assets fit into the U.S. financial system.  Though it’s her day job, crypto was never an outward focus of her campaign. Instead, Bond embraced the politics of former President Donald Trump, courting support from his son, Donald Trump Jr., as she touted the mainstays of the “Make America Great Again” movement. Her anti-abortion, tough-on-immigration, pro-police stance didn’t tend to highlight her views on the future of finance.  As in some other campaigns during this primary season, such as congressional candidate Carrick Flynn’s very expensive loss in Oregon, the crypto industry’s wagers on Bond led to disappointment.  By early this month, Bond recorded a significant $1.1 million in campaign contributions. Though about $800,000 of that came from her own pocket, according to federal campaign filings, more than $300,000 was donated by other individuals, including a list of prominent crypto and finance names – among them, several executives from FTX and related Alameda Research.  That's no surprise for somebody working for a crypto advocacy group, but also because Bond's boyfriend and regular companion on the campaign trail is Ryan Salame, the co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets. (He's known to be a major contributor to Republican politics, as his $15 million in donations to his American Dream Federal Action political action committee reflect – seemingly at odds with the Democratic support of FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.)  Salame also gave $1.5 million to GMI PAC, which was set up by crypto leaders to support their political efforts. Federal records show that super PAC gave more than $1 million to Crypto Innovation PAC, which bought more than $1 million in outside ads supporting Bond’s campaign.  Other Bond supporters – largely from outside her district – included Daniel Gallagher, a former commissioner at the Securities and Exchange Commission who is chief legal officer at Robinhood (HOOD); several executives from Multicoin Capital, and a number of lobbyists and lawyers.  The contributors list also featured prominent former Trump administration spokesman-turned-critic, Anthony Scaramucci, and others from his SkyBridge Capital investment firm. Scaramucci is also a major backer of the Crypto Innovation PAC.  New York’s 1st Congressional District seat was vacated by Republican Rep. Lee Zeldin when he ran for New York governor. Bond easily out-raised and out-spent her chief Republican contender, but LaLota had the support of more traditional Republicans in Suffolk County.

Cryptos Regain Ground but Investors Nervously Await Fed Chairman's Signals  By James Rubin  Call this week's cryptocurrency price saga, ""Waiting for Jerome.""  Bitcoin and other major cryptos were mostly flat Tuesday even as investors maintained their anxious vigil ahead of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's scheduled utterances on Friday about the central bank's direction on monetary policy.  Bitcoin was recently trading at about $21,200, roughly where it stood 24 hours ago. The largest crypto by market value has lost about 10% over the past week amid a wider crypto sell-off that has dropped digital assets total capitalization below $1 trillion.  Ether on Tuesday and was recently changing hands at about $1,600, about flat from the same time a day go. The second-largest crypto by market value's price has plunged approximately 12% during the past seven days. Other major cryptos were mixed after many of them spent a good portion of the day in the green.  AVAX and DOT were recently up over a percentage point. But EOS and YGG fell more than 6% and 4%, respectively. EOS's decline follows a week-long surge after EOS Network Foundation (ENF) announced last week that Antelope would be used as the underlying protocol for EOSIO-based blockchains.  Still, the industry mood remained circumspect at best as Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong reflected in a CNBC interview. ""We've been in a down cycle but it's not unusual for us,"" Armstrong said. ""This one happens to coincide with the broader macro environment coming down. We all hope it will be 12-18 months and a nice recovery. You have to plan for it being longer.""  Equities are flat  Stocks traded sideways, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average closing down 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively, amid tepid trading. Equity markets are also awaiting Powell's signals at the annual Jackson Hole, Wyoming, economic symposium.  Is the Fed is still alarmed enough about inflation but comfortable with the pace of the current economic slowdown to maintain its aggressive monetary course of 75 basis point rate hikes? Or will it go dovish and announce a more moderate 50-point hike? Investor expectations have shifted back and forth in previous days.  Celsius Networks' challenges returned to at least a part of the crypto industry spotlight as it sued crypto custodian Prime Trust in an attempt to claw back $17 million in crypto that the bankrupt lender alleges its former business partner still holds. Filed in federal bankruptcy court, the 54-page suit stems from a dispute over assets tied to Celsius’ yield product customers in Washington and New York.  Meanwhile, debate continued about the Ethereum Merge that will shift the blockchain platform's protocol from proof-of-work to faster, more environmentally friendly proof-of-stake. Some observers believe the change will have little impact on crypto pricing, despite ether's dramatic gains earlier this month.  But Katie Talati, head of research at crypto asset manager Arca, was cautiously optimistic, highlighting the energy efficiency and other improvements resulting from the Merge in comments to CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program. ""From a technological standpoint, this is as advanced and as significant as it gets,"" Talati said, adding: ""We're potentially going to have a much lower emission of [ether], but then also the benefit like the potential for anybody who is a validator or node on the network to earn part of that staking yield.""  She continued that ether is ""really hard to price in general because it does act like a currency,"" and that Arca would be eyeing data about the yield post-Merge in combination with other information ""hoping to have a better valuation for [ether].""

In a recent blog post, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) highlighted the increasing interconnectedness between crypto and stocks traded on regional exchanges, reiterating its concerns that crypto might spur financial instability, even if it leads to environmental benefits and greater financial inclusion.  The IMF entry comes as many crypto observers see a lessening correlation between digital and more traditional assets, although others believe the two remain linked, particularly crypto and tech stocks. The latter group, however, has focused largely on the connection between globally dominant U.S. equity markets and crypto.  While measured in tone, the post dovetails with IMF positions that have often seemed unfriendly to crypto, including earlier this year when Argentina agreed to “discourage” the use of cryptocurrency as a condition of a $45 billion loan from the IMF.  Crypto's growth in Asia  Noting crypto's soaring popularity in Asia among consumers and institutional investors, the Washington, D.C., organization said that while ""the financial sector appears to have been insulated from these sharp movements, it may not be in future boom-bust cycles.""  ""Contagion could spread through individual or institutional investors that may hold both crypto and traditional financial assets or liabilities,"" the IMF said. ""Large losses on crypto may drive these investors to rebalance their portfolios, possibly causing financial-market volatility or even default on traditional liabilities.""  The IMF noted a sharp increase in the correlation between Asian equity markets, and bitcoin and ether in returns and volatility since 2020. It said that return correlations between bitcoin and Indian stock markets had risen ""10-fold over the [coronavirus] pandemic"" and that volatility correlations had tripled.  ""Key drivers of the increased interconnectedness of crypto and equity markets in Asia could include growing acceptance of crypto-related platforms and investment vehicles in the stock market and at the over-the-counter market, or more generally growing crypto adoption by retail and institutional investors in Asia,"" the IMF said.  Based on methodology the IMF highlighted in a paper earlier this year, the organization said that rising ""crypto-equity correlations in Asia"" had been accompanied by ""a sharp rise in crypto-equity volatility spillovers in India, Vietnam and Thailand"" that could shock financial markets.  The IMF noted increasing efforts throughout the region to regulate crypto that have resulted from increased adoption and called for a ratcheting up of efforts to build on these initiatives. Those efforts would include filling ""data gaps that prevent domestic and international regulators from fully understanding ownership and use of crypto and its intersection with the traditional financial sector,"" and clearer guidelines for financial institutions to ""protect retail investors.""

The bulls have faded out from the market but are consistently trying to protect price from falling below the immediate support level. Despite the 1.5% appreciation over the last 24 hours, XRP price doesn&apos;t seem to be out of the woods yet. Over the last one week the coin lost 10% but the coin has maintained its price above the vital support line. Technical outlook for the coin also indicated bearishness. After XRP price lost the $0.39 price level, the altcoin was mostly trading sideways. For the coin to move upwards it is important that XRP moves above the $0.34 price mark. Buying pressure on the chart declined considerably which was a sign of price weakness. With Bitcoin moving down on the chart, other altcoins have also dipped on the chart. If XRP price loses the current support level then further downward movement could be expected over the immediate trading sessions.
