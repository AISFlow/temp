15763742,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4625086-paypal-usd-a-new-stablecoin-enters-the-arena?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1691451893,PayPal USD: A New Stablecoin Enters The Arena,"Summary PayPal has launched a USD-denominated stablecoin called PayPal USD on the Ethereum blockchain. Stablecoins are seen as the ""killer app"" of cryptocurrency networks, allowing for peer-to-peer. It's unclear how PayPal will be monetizing PYUSD, and the token could theoretically cannibalize PayPal's core business. After halting development due to regulatory concerns earlier this year, peer to peer payment giant PayPal ( PYPL ) has officially launched a USD-denominated stablecoin. This new stablecoin, which is called PayPal USD (PYUSD-USD), will live on the Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) blockchain network. This is a very interesting move for PayPal as the fiat-backed stablecoin market has been in decline for about 18 months. In this article, we'll go over what PYUSD is, why stablecoins are such an important part of distributed ledger technology, and what this could ultimately mean for PayPal's core business in the future. PayPal USD PayPal USD is a fiat-backed digital currency that can be utilized in and outside of the PayPal ecosystem. The PYUSD token will be issued by Paxos Trust and will be redeemable on a 1:1 basis for dollars. The collateral for the token will be cash deposits and short-term US treasuries. Functionally, PYUSD appears to be similar to other stablecoin projects that have been issued by Paxos Trust in the past. Those projects include Paxos' own stablecoin Pax Dollar ( USDP-USD ) and Binance USD ( BUSD-USD ). Though PYUSD will be PayPal-branded and usable within the PayPal ecosystem, as an ERC-20 token, PYUSD's core differentiator from cash held in PayPal's app is that it can be swapped and held outside of the PayPal ecosystem as well. Stablecoins Are The ""Killer App"" Cryptocurrency networks are designed to be peer-to-peer. Aside from the notion that purely digital assets like Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) or Ethereum lack any fundamental backing, one of the major reasons why cryptocurrencies have failed to scale as global payment assets is the volatility of the token prices. Fiat-denominated stablecoins have been seen as sort of the ""killer app"" of crypto network rails because they allow for peer-to-peer transactions in a familiar unit of account. Put another way, it's easier for people to comprehend dollar-denominated transactions than it is for people to start pricing goods and services in ""sats,"" or satoshis, on the Bitcoin ledger. Thus, transitioning from USD in private-ledger ecosystems to something like Circle's USCoin USD ( USDC-USD ) in public-ledger ecosystems is seen as a more logical step forward than moving to BTC or ETH as the currencies of P2P payments. The belief in fiat-backed stablecoins helped the stablecoin market explode from a $3 billion capitalization level in early 2020 to over $100 billion just two years later on Ethereum alone. Ethereum (Dune Analytics/KARTOD) However, the supply of the stables on Ethereum has declined from a peak of roughly $125 billion in Q1-22 to just over $74 billion today. What's noteworthy though is most of the reduction in stablecoin supply over the last twelve months has been in over-collateralized crypto-backed stablecoins rather than the fiat-backed stables by percentage: Asset Class Current Capitalization 12 Month Change Fiat-backed Stables $67.8 billion -30.0% Crypto-backed Stables $4.8 billion -48.8% Algorithmic Stables $1.4 billion -39.2% Source: Dune Analytics/KARTOD To this point, the market has put considerably more trust in fiat-backed stablecoins rather than crypto-backed or algorithmic alternatives. What makes these assets so useful is the ability to transact outside of walled-garden ecosystems. As popular as PayPal has become in recent years, the app itself is still a closed ecosystem. Users of PayPal can't send money to friends or family who would wish to receive those funds through Block, Inc.'s ( SQ ) Cash App, for example. This is where public blockchain networks offer an advantage. When a developer integrates with a public blockchain network like Ethereum, a user can send stablecoins peer-to-peer no matter which wallet application the sender and receiver are using. For example, a sender can move Circle's USDC on Ethereum from MetaMask to Trust Wallet ( TWT-USD ), Unstoppable Wallet, or Coinbase ( COIN ) Wallet without any application-level gatekeeping. PayPal's new stablecoin can theoretically be utilized in the same way. Who Wins From PYUSD Adoption? What is unclear at this point is how beneficial this PYUSD stablecoin will ultimately be for PayPal's bottom line. The big problem that I see with this project is networks that utilize distributed ledger technology are actually insurgents to current global payment infrastructure. If it reaches any kind of real level of adoption, PYUSD usage arguably cannibalizes PayPal's traditional payments business. A PayPal-branded stablecoin would appear to be somewhat destructive to PayPal's earnings in two different ways: PayPal isn't the issuer of the token, Paxos Trust is the issuer. PayPal doesn't generate fee revenue either because Ethereum validators earn the transaction fees on the network. On point number 1, it would be Paxos Trust that holds the collateral of the PYUSD token. Which means interest on treasuries that are backing PYUSD would go to Paxos Trust. It stands to reason that PayPal should have some sort of profit sharing incentive with Paxos to utilize PayPal's brand, but we don't know what that looks like yet. That said, interest from treasury holdings isn't PayPal's bread and butter anyway. The company makes most of its money through its transaction fees. PayPal On point number 2, PayPal's current transaction fee business in its closed ecosystem likely doesn't benefit from PYUSD either. PYUSD is currently being advertised as a feeless currency within PayPal's walled garden, albeit between friends not businesses. However, sending the PYUSD outside of the PayPal ecosystem doesn't appear to actually benefit PayPal either as Ethereum network validators take the fees from on-chain transactions. Taking these two points together, it's unclear how PayPal would actually be monetizing its PYUSD stablecoin. Summary Despite the clear advantage of a fully backed stablecoin asset compared to algorithmic or crypto-backed alternatives, the crypto market has yet to find a stablecoin that has the capitalized staying power of Tether ( USDT-USD ). 57.8% USDT Share (Dune Analytics/KARTOD) With nearly 58% share of the entire fiat-backed stablecoin market on Ethereum, Tether is the only leading fiat-backed stable that is still near pre-Terra Classic ( LUNC-USD ) collapse capitalization levels. USDC is down roughly 50% on Ethereum and BUSD is down 85% from its peak on Ethereum. But the market still values fiat-backed stables. TX Share (Dune Analytics/KARTOD) The category commands over 90% share of stablecoin transaction volume on Ethereum. Tether is somewhat infamous within crypto circles as there have historically been questions about where that token's collateral is held. In my view, there is room for another fiat-backed stablecoin from a trusted financial company like PayPal. However, what I'm less convinced of is how that stablecoin will actually benefit PayPal financially. PayPal's ability to monetize the token will come down to how much revenue it can generate from the collateral that is backing the stablecoin and/or how much it can take from processing transactions within PayPal's ecosystem or from sending PYUSD on-chain. It seems to me that PYUSD could actually cannibalize PayPal's core business. For now, it looks like PYUSD adoption will be better for Ethereum than for PayPal.",NEUTRAL,ETH | PYUSD,BUSINESS | ETH | ICO | MARKET | PYUSD,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4625086-paypal-usd-a-new-stablecoin-enters-the-arena?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/15763742.jpeg

15762466,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=546087,1691449228,"Litecoin Hashrate Taps New All-Time High, Will LTC Price Follow Suit?","The Litecoin hashrate has been going up steadily over the last year. This was mainly driven by the anticipation leading up to the Litecoin halving that was slated to take place in August. Now that the halving event has come and gone, the hashrate has risen to a new all-time high, but the question is, whether the price of LTC will follow suit. Litecoin Hashrate Taps New ATH Of 1.03 PH/s The steady rise in the Litecoin hashrate is a testament to the growing interest in the network. The hashrate points to the fact that there are more miners on the blockchain trying to guess the correct answers to each block. And this translates to better security overall for the Litecoin network. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Could Break Above $2,000 If This Happens Interestingly, this increase in hashrate has seen the network hit not only a new all-time high but a significant milestone. According to data from CoinWarz, the Litecoin hashrate rose as high as 1.03 pentahashes per second (PH/s) on August 4. This means that for the first time, LTC’s hashrate has left the terahashes per second (TH/s) territory and crossed into the pentahashes per second (PH/s) territory. Although it is still a long way from Bitcoin’s exahashes per second (EH/s), it is a testament to how much the Litecoin network has grown. The Litecoin hashrate has since retraced back into the TH/s territory, now sitting at 739.88 TH/s as of Monday, August 7. But a look over the last year’s hashrate chart shows that even this is a high level for the blockchain’s hashrate. LTC hashrate remains high compared to 2022 | Source: CoinWarz Will LTC’s Price Follow The Hashrate? Since the Litecoin hashrate hit its new all-time high, the price of LTC has been more volatile than normal. This is not out of the ordinary though as the altcoin has been following the general market trend and LTC’s is a testament to that trend. So far though, it doesn’t seem like LTC has made any effort to break out of this trend. If anything, it has suffered more declines than recoveries, even dipping to as low as $$80.65 on August 4. This decline shows that the new hashrate ATH has not moved investors to invest more in the coin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investor Sentiment Flips Toward Greed Despite Fall Below $29,000 For now, something that could lead to an uptrend for Litecoin’s price is if Bitcoin begins another rally and the crypto market starts to see improved sentiment. Otherwise, LTC will likely continue to toe the $82 line for the better part of the week.

The rumors appear to be a major contributing factor to why the firm experienced multi-million withdrawals during the weekend, while Tron’s Total Value Locked (TVL) has fallen below $2.5 billion. Trouble In Paradise? Over the past weekend, cryptocurrency exchange Huobi experienced massive outflows worth about $64 million amid reports that Chinese authorities were investigating its executives and the likelihood of insolvency. There were speculations that the platform’s leaders were arrested on the 5th of August in China. According to popular Chinese reporter Colin Wu, the arrest was due to Huobi’s involvement with gambling websites. One top official of the exchange also recently left the company, though it remains unclear if that was connected to the ongoing investigations by Chinese authorities.

The rumors were so rife that the withdrawals triggered serious volatility in HT’s price and the token fluctuated during the weekend before settling at its present level of about $2.66. Furthermore, there are also rumors that the exchange is undergoing protracted financial challenges. According to Adam Cochran, an angel investor and fintech executive, there are some discrepancies in the platform’s Tether (USDT) holding. Based on on-chain data, Huobi held less than $90 million of assets on the 5th of August. However, their recent “Merkle Tree Audit” claims they hold $630 million in USDT. Cochran believes this means that Huobi might be insolvent, implying the platform may not have sufficient funds to meet its obligations. HT price sitting at $2.6 | Source: HTUSD on Tradingview.com Huobi Reacts To Speculations In response to the speculations, Justin Sun, who serves as an Advisor to the exchange, recently took to his Twitter account to offer some clarifications. In a series of tweets, he asked users to “ignore FUD, keep! #TRON and Huobi will thrive through continuous development. Trust in our vision and community efforts for a stronger future. Perseverance guarantees success!” Related Reading: Curve Finance Announces $1.85 Million Bounty For Stable Pool Exploiter Many users simply responded by posting the figure “4” below his tweet. The figure, which was popularized in the crypto space by Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao, Binance CEO, simply means “Ignore FUD, fake news, attacks, etc.” This is not the first time Sun and his team are facing serious troubles. In the past, there have been rumors of financial troubles at the exchange. However, it remains to be seen what the likely fallout would be in the most recent event.

15759180,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=546067,1691442041,"These Bitcoin Metrics Are At Important Retests, Will Bullish Trend Prevail?","On-chain data shows two Bitcoin indicators are currently retesting levels that have historically been relevant for the market’s course. Bitcoin NUPL For Both Short-Term & Mid-Term Holders Is Neutral Currently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC NUPL has been retesting crucial levels recently. The “Net Unrealized Profit/Loss” (NUPL) is a metric that keeps track of the net amount of profit or loss that investors are holding currently. This indicator works by looking through the on-chain history of each coin in circulation to see what price it was last moved at. If this previous transfer price for any coin was less than the current spot price of Bitcoin, then that particular coin is holding a profit right now. The NUPL counts this profit that the coin is holding in the unrealized profit. Similarly, the loss that underwater coins are holding gets included in the unrealized loss. The metric then takes the difference between these two numbers to find the net profit/loss status of the entire market. In the context of the current discussion, the entire market isn’t of interest, however, only specific sections of it are. In particular, two BTC cohorts called the “short-term holders” (STHs) and the “mid-term holders” (MTHs) are of relevance. The STHs include all investors who bought their coins within the last six months, while the MTHs are those who have been holding their coins since at least six months ago and at most 2 years ago. First, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin NUPL specifically for the STHs: Looks like the value of the metric has approached zero recently | Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin STH NUPL has been positive throughout this rally that first started back in January of this year. Generally, this is the case in bullish trends, as the STHs are those who bought relatively recently, so any price rises immediately reflect on their profit/loss status. What’s more significant, however, is the indicator’s relationship with the zero mark. At this line, the STHs as a whole are neutral, meaning that their unrealized losses equal their unrealized profits. Usually, whenever the metric retests this line from above during bullish trends, it finds support and the price feels a bullish effect. This could be seen working in action during this rally alone, as the rebounds in March and June both occurred when the STH NUPL approached this line. Related Reading: Bitcoin NVT Shows Bearish Crossover, Price Drop Incoming? From the chart, it’s visible that the metric has once again fallen to this line recently. This retest may be quite important, as a plunge below could mean a reversal back toward a bearish regime. In the below graph, it’s also visible that the MTH NUPL is retesting the same line, although this indicator is approaching it from the negative zone. The metric is retesting the break-even line | Source: CryptoQuant The MTHs had been sitting in losses until now, but they are on the verge of transitioning back into profits currently. If the metric can manage to break through the level, then it would be a positive sign for the rally, as the bullish trend has historically continued whenever these investors have come back above water. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Rebound Anytime Soon? Here’s What On-Chain Data Says The break-even line providing resistance to Bitcoin, however, is also a possibility, in which case the asset would feel a bearish effect. It now remains to be seen how this retest, as well as the one of the STH NUPL, would pan out in the coming days.

And based on the early voting results on a key proposal from the platform’s founder, they appear reluctant to keep footing the bill.  Mango Labs, the main company building the Solana blockchain-based exchange, is short on cash after burning nearly $2 million – its entire 2023 budget – six months ahead of schedule.  Now, with more “regulatory inquiries” looming, the company has asked members of Mango DAO – the so-called decentralized autonomous organization or DAO that oversees the protocol – to approve another $2 million for legal expenses. A person or account gets the right to vote by acquiring Mango DAO’s MNGO tokens.  But the Mango DAO voters aren’t so keen to cut the check. This past weekend, they rejected the funding request from Mango Labs founder Daffy Durairaj, with one voter calling it a “money pit thus far.” In forum posts, project insiders demanded more transparency into how the company manages its budget.  According to the website Realms, there’s about $89 million in the Mango DAO treasury, but most of that is denominated in MNGO tokens, and the market for those might not be liquid enough to sell them quickly and easily. Project insiders say that the main source of funding would likely come from a $15.3 million stash of dollar-linked stablecoins within the Mango Dao treasury, primarily denominated in USDC.  Mango DAO treasury  The internal political tension highlights the ongoing ramifications and consequences of crypto hacks, often lasting long beyond the simple theft of funds. Mango Labs is mounting a pricey civil suit against Eisenberg over his October 2022 theft of $110 million in crypto and also participating in the sprawling, and expensive, federal regulatory and criminal cases against him.  “This funding is necessary to handle legal costs of regulatory inquiries that have arisen after the exploit last year, cooperation with law enforcement and regulators and pursuing legal claims against Avi Eisenberg to help recover funds for the DAO,” Durairaj said in Mango’s governance forums.  But those efforts are quickly burning through what Mango Markets co-founder Max Schneider wrote was an “outsized” portion of the DAO’s stablecoin treasury of $15 million.  Durairaj personally holds enough MNGO governance tokens to muscle through the vote, former project insiders say. But he may be unwilling to do so given the spotlight the SEC has already placed on the centralization of Mango’s “so-called ‘governance token.’”  Despite the pushback and first vote’s barreling toward defeat Monday, Durairaj has initiated a second, identical funding proposal.

This time, it is the action of a particular Ethereum whale that has caught attention, one that has the ETH community in shock as to the reasons for such action. The mysterious whale in question with the Ethereum address ‘nd4.eth’ sent $4.5 million worth of Ether (2,500 ETH) to a ‘burn’ address, in a move that removes these tokens from circulation forever. This interesting event, which occurred on July 26, has led to a burning question on the lips of everyone – who is this mysterious whale? Who Is The Mysterious Ethereum Whale? Although there is currently limited information on the mysterious whale, Crypto Twitter has been able to dig up some information as to who this person might be. Recent Twitter discussions revealed that the user behind ‘nd4.eth’ was on Binance Leaderboard which shows the traders in profits on the platform. Related Reading: Curve Finance Announces $1.85 Million Bounty For Stable Pool Exploiter Another Twitter user (@serialsexhaver) revealed that the trader had over $20 million in earnings on GMT long and “went all in on a btc short” and then deleted his account. The Tweet read: Last year he was on Binance leaderboard, made north on 20mill on gmt long, was giving away anons gmt sneakers and went all in on a btc short …then deleted his account This is also not the first time this particular user is doing something like this. According to information gotten from Web3 portfolio tracker DeBank, the “nd4.eth’ address had previously sent Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) to another burn address many times, with these transactions amounting to approximately $8,000 in total. The address still has a huge portfolio though, with close to $3.57 million staked on GMX and GNS. ETH price plunges to $1,823 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com Contributing To The Growth Of ETH While the crypto community continues to speculate the reasons for the ‘$4.5 million burn,’ there is no doubt that the ‘nd4.eth’ address has, for whatever reason, contributed to the growth of the Ethereum ecosystems. His actions also further fuel the Ethereum as an ‘ultra-sound money’ narrative. Laurence Day, the creator of the Wildcat Protocol, jokingly commended the individual when he stated: “If you didn’t wake up this morning and say thank you to nd4.eth for contributing to the ultrasound money narrative, I want you to have a long, hard think about what you’re trying to achieve here.” Related Reading: Crypto Funds Vs Bitcoin Holders: Who Was The Better Performer In H1 2023 True to it, the burning of tokens makes it deflationary and is usually done to decrease the token’s circulating supply and help boost demand and increase its market value.

42392752,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgB0Jh,1691438244,"PayPal’s Regulated Stablecoin Is ‘Watershed Moment’ in Crypto, Says Partner Paxos","PYUSD is the first regulated stablecoin from a global payments company.  Customers’ assets will be protected in case Paxos, the token's issuer, files for bankruptcy.  The dominant players in stablecoins, cryptocurrencies designed to mimic U.S. dollars, don’t appear to be flustered by fintech giant PayPal launching its own PYUSD token, but it’s a “watershed moment” in terms of bringing regulation to the business, according to Paxos Trust, the firm that is issuing the new stablecoin.  The vast majority of stablecoins in circulation are either USDT or USDC. USDT was created in the early days of crypto by crypto firm Tether. Its market cap reached an all-time high of $83.2 billion in June. USDC is issued by payments company Circle in cooperation with crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN). Its market cap stands at about $26 billion. The overall stablecoin market is about $125 billion.  Walter Hessert, head of strategy at Paxos Trust, says there's a big difference between PayPal's PYUSD token and the other stablecoins, because of Paxos’ status as a trust company that is regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services, or NYDFS.  Read more: What Is a Stablecoin?  “The difference is significant because we have a prudential regulator,” Hessert said in an interview with CoinDesk. “In our case, you have a regulator overseeing every activity involved in the issuance, including the reserve management. It means no matter where you are in the world, anybody who has this token is protected by the oversight and the rules that are set for us by New York.”  In terms of those rules, a big one is the removal of bankruptcy risk, Hessert said. “Customers' assets are protected, including if Paxos were to go bankrupt — a situation we now see with a bunch of companies in crypto. If you can end up sitting in line as a general creditor of a private company that issued you a stablecoin, that’s not as good as a physical dollar,” he said.  If Paxos were to file for bankruptcy, Hessert explained, the NYDFS would step in and PYUSD would be held out of the bankruptcy so that customers wouldn't become unwitting creditors in a bankruptcy and funds would be returned to every token holder.  Read more: I Have 1M Questions About the PayPal Stablecoin. Here Are 5  Paolo Ardoine, chief technology officer of Tether, said PayPal’s move into the stablecoin market won’t likely have much impact on Tether, because Tether has yet to enter the U.S. market. PYUSD, however, could become a worthy competitor to USDC, which has seen a steady decline in market cap following the collapse of ​​Silicon Valley Bank, where Circle kept some of its USDC reserves.  Circle co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire said in a statement to CoinDesk that PayPal's entry into the stablecoin market ""is a strong signal that near-instant, borderless and programmable payments in the form of stablecoins are here to stay.""  PayPal has evolved in crypto. In 2020, it began to allow users to buy, sell and hold some cryptocurrencies on its platform, essentially following the likes of Block and CashApp. Introducing its own stablecoin takes it even deeper into crypto.  As with Tether and Circle, reserves will be held in U.S. Treasury bills. The interest earned on those bills will be shared between PayPal and Paxos.  “USDT and USDC are pretty similar these days,” Hessert said. “They are both unregulated, and they both are fairly transparent now.”  PayPal didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.  UPDATE (Aug. 7 20:24 UTC): Added statement from Jeremy Allaire.  CORRECTION (Aug. 7 20:58 UTC): A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that PYUSD is the first stablecoin to be overseen by a regulator.

42392766,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgB18z,1691436568,2 Months in El Salvador: The Ground Game for Bitcoin Adoption,"In September 2021, El Salvador adopted Bitcoin as its second legally-recognized national currency alongside the U.S. dollar. It is the first nation to adopt the “Bitcoin Standard,” serving as a testing ground for other countries looking to adopt the digital currency as legal tender.  Jonathan Martin is a graduate of Stanford University, Georgetown University, and a student at The Wharton School, currently on leave immersing himself in the world of Bitcoin in El Salvador.  President Nayib Bukele, the 42-year-old Salvadoran Leader in his first term in office, has a vision to completely revolutionize the economy, starting with the integration of Bitcoin. Businesses must accept bitcoin for payment by law, and the government has purchased 2,381 BTC to date (worth ~$70 million as of this writing). It also launched its own bitcoin wallet – called the Chivo Wallet – and announced plans to deploy 1,500 bitcoin ATMs to help spur adoption.  Bitcoin for everyday people  El Salvador and a flood of bitcoin expats view bitcoin as the future of money, but how the average Salvadoran feels about the digital commodity is a different question – particularly in its use as a medium of exchange in everyday commerce. If bitcoin is to become the next global reserve currency, the average non-bitcoiner must believe in its intrinsic value, even if they do not understand the underlying system that backs it.  Read more: David Z. Morris - 1 Year of Bitcoin in El Salvador: The Bad, the Good and the Ugly  From my time living in the country so far, the potential for bitcoin to succeed as a currency is evident, but whether the average Salvadoran will embrace it is still yet to be determined.  Most Western bitcoin investors have a low-time preference for money (i.e., they are buying bitcoin to hold for years or decades) and believe it will continue to go up in value. However, to the average Salvadoran worker, living hand-to-mouth without robust savings, do the decentralized benefits and future potential of bitcoin present any real incremental value to them vs. using U.S. dollars?  Just a few years ago, El Salvador was one of the most dangerous countries in the world. Today, Bukele’s uncompromising security policies have dramatically reduced crime, and citizens now feel safe to start businesses, go to dinner with their friends and travel to areas that were previously avoided. As a part of the rebrand, the government has implemented business-friendly taxation policies to incentivize foreign investment in financial innovation.  Even so, outside of people who evangelize Bitcoin, I have encountered mixed responses to the prospect of using it as a currency.  Bitcoin vs. fiat  U.S. President Richard Nixon took the U.S. dollar off the gold standard in 1971, and since then the world economy has operated in a fiat system. Fiat money only has value because the government says it has value; there is no scarce commodity backing it. The current system works well for people who own assets, and poorly for people who save in fiat.  This is because debasement (i.e., inflation) is a feature of the system and not a bug — U.S. dollars are programmed to lose their purchasing power over time. Similarly, the transaction fees associated with transferring or accessing your wealth can be both onerous and inefficient. Bitcoin provides an egalitarian alternative.  During my first 48 hours in El Salvador, I experienced first-hand the restrictive frictional costs associated with fiat banking when traveling abroad. The ATM fees in San Salvador are higher than in the U.S. It costs $5 to $8 to withdraw money, and my bank flagged several of my transactions as being fraudulent, leading to my card being frozen twice.

However, it was not long before I found an Athena bitcoin ATM in a nearby mall using Athena’s map on their website. The Know-Your-Customer (KYC) requirement to deter money laundering made the process slower than using a normal ATM: I had to present an ID, have my picture taken, and wait 30-plus minutes for confirmation via SMS text message.  Athena also takes a 5% fee for the bitcoin-to-fiat conversion, which ended up being significantly more than the fiat ATM fees. However, the second time I used the ATM, I found the process to be more straight-forward as a foreign visitor because I did not have to deal with canceled transactions and SMS fraud alerts from my bank in the U.S.  Bitcoin for everyday services  I am taking Spanish lessons daily. I asked my tutor if she would take bitcoin as payment, and she said she only takes cash because she doesn’t know what to do with bitcoin once she has it. My Salvadoran driver had similar hesitations when I tried to pay him in bitcoin, despite having a Chivo wallet. I ended up making a bank transfer using Zelle to pay him.  I attended an expats Bitcoin meet-up with mostly Americans and Canadians who share my passion for the digital commodity. The vendors only accepted bitcoin, and I purchased a T-shirt from Alejandra (Miss El Salvador) using my Coinbase wallet. The people I spoke to who understand Bitcoin deeply view El Salvador as freer and more open-minded than their home countries.  The government began its big push for Bitcoin adoption two years ago, yet adoption is still clearly in its infancy here. Most workers still prefer cash, and the latency associated with bitcoin settlement times make the currency somewhat cumbersome, at least at present. Some of the vendors I’ve encountered so far have layer 2 Lightning integrations, but it is not common. Most people I’ve spoken to so far do not have a deep understanding of how the digital commodity is backed.  I view the Lightning Network and greater education about the benefits of bitcoin vs. U.S. dollars as the solution to Salvadoran hesitancy in using the currency. Reducing settlement times using L2 solutions and convincing people that their future purchasing power is safer in bitcoin than in cash will be central in increasing adoption and expanding use cases.  I intend to continue to try and use bitcoin for commerce, and to try to educate more Salvadoran everyday people on the power of Bitcoin.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Jonathan Martin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/08/07/2-months-in-el-salvador-the-ground-game-for-bitcoin-adoption,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b07fbc5e719bee35d6ba3f107bfe01d49385fcbe-768x1024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392746,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgAzjn,1691434545,Crypto’s Path Forward Could Follow the Financial World's Departure From LIBOR,"The world is officially done with the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), which was a benchmark lending rate that drove the financial industry, and therefore the business world, for more than four decades.  Starting this month, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) has replaced LIBOR in the United States, a transition that has taken more than 11 years since a scandal enveloped LIBOR.  Dmitry Gooshchin is the chief operating officer and co-founder of Endotech.io.  This switch is significant far beyond lending rates, underlining that real change and innovation are possible in the financial system, even following misdeeds and corruption. And it offers hope for crypto and financial innovation that takes advantage of new technology.  Crypto has suffered its share of misconduct and misdeeds with which regulators and other officials have been slow to keep pace. . Many industry skeptics – and others – have even declared the sector doomed because of the lack of policing.  Still , we see multiple institutional investors applying for crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Could market demand among institutional investors result in reliable, regulated crypto trading? Can the financial system remake crypto like it remade interbank loan rates?  LIBOR’s path to scandal  LIBOR represented the self-reported average rate at which the world’s largest banks would loan money to other banks. It was often seen as the lower boundary for any type of loan or performance benchmark – a pillar of the financial system and reliable benchmark. Variable rate loans, adjustable mortgages as well as instruments like swaps and futures were usually tied, to some degree, to this rate.  But then scandal hit with the revelation in 2012 that banks were artificially controlling the rate, including by reporting borrowing rates at levels that would benefit their swap traders, and make banks look more insulated from risk than they were. Safeguards were few, and the system, which relied on banks to simply report what rates they would charge, basically left the mice guarding the cheese.  See also: DeFi Definitely Isn't Dead| Opinion  That is similar to how the crypto sector has been operating; with little oversight on big players controlling billions of dollars. The crypto sector is not the foundation of the financial system the way interbank lending rates are, but crypto was the top-performing asset class in this year’sfirst quarter, and institutional investors continue to acquire it.  Crypto has become a bellwether for innovation in the financial sector.  What’s different?  Officials should have noticed the irregularities in LIBOR earlier and taken action, as reports and clues began to surface as early as 2007. LIBOR should have also come under more scrutiny for the role it played in the global financial crisis, which began with the fall of AIG and other U.S. financial firms, and their heavy use of credit default swaps.  But reaction was slow. When regulators eventually took action, in 2012, several financial institutions received fines for their role in the LIBOR scandal, and over the last decade, the system has been gradually reformed with the U.S. replacing it with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate.  Despite the long timeline, SOFR is undoubtedly an improvement – mainly because it is based on actual transactions, not just on rates that banks report as the lowest they will accept. This reduces some of the concentration of power that large banks had, and reflects the reality in the market. It also means that the financial system still has something it demands – a reference rate. In other words, officials did not throw the baby out with the bathwater.  A vision for crypto  Crypto could be on a similar trajectory. For years, regulators ignored it. Yet it has been at the heart of financial innovation, including peer-to-peer transactions, AI-powered trading tools and was seen as the go-to currency in many visions of a future economy and tech world, including the metaverse.  It has suffered its own mishaps and crises, includingFTX’s alleged mismanagement and the bankruptcy filings of Celsius and Three Arrows Capital, and regulators were late to recognize the cryptos’ potential pitfalls.  See also: Why Did Celsius Go Up in Flames? Alex Mashinsky Fueled the Fire | Opinion  At this point, the course of action by officials differs from the organized LIBOR reform. The process has been more haphazard than organized, with the SEC filing lawsuits against Binance, Coinbase and others operating by one-off enforcement rather than a planned regulatory framework.  In fact, regulators can still not agreeabout how to classify many of these products, and which regulatory agency should oversee them. This is a problem.  Demand leads to change  But there are signs of hope that regulatory clarity will emerge.. Just like the financial system needed a benchmark and worked to replace LIBOR, it is now demanding access to crypto, and working to make that happen.  BlackRock, Fidelity and other financial service powerhouses have recently filed applications for spot bitcoin ETFs, addressing specific concerns raised by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s in rejecting multiple, similar products over the past few years. A number of banks have also introduced important crypto initiatives that will eventually lead to crypto spot ETFs and other regulated products.  Bringing crypto into the mainstream is not only a way for large financial service organizations to make money but to continue financial innovation, leading to new types of assets and trading methods.  Demand will spur crypto’s increasing acceptance and growth. This is what happened with LIBOR – and what is essential to support a reliable yet innovative financial system.

A use case of cryptocurrencies that has seen particular growth is in crypto donations and the Singapore Red Cross has now taken the plunge. Singapore Red Cross Taking Crypto Donations The Singapore Red Cross is the latest to jump on the crypto bandwagon as the homegrown humanitarian organization recently partnered with Triple-A, allowing donors to contribute Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Tether (USDT), and USD Coin (USDC). The country’s Red Cross Society is looking to capitalize on crypto adoptions by partnering with Triple-A, the first crypto payment gateway licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). Related Reading: Curve Finance Announces $1.85 Million Bounty For Stable Pool Exploiter The Singapore Red Cross received more than $4.5 million in donations in 2022. However, by accepting BTC, ETH, USDT, and USDC, the humanitarian organization is opening itself up to donations from people across the globe. “By accepting digital currencies, we open our doors to a new segment of donors who are tech-savvy and wish to make a difference through their digital assets,” said Benjamin William, Secretary General and CEO of the Singapore Red Cross. “Enabling cryptocurrency donations also opens more opportunities for the new generation of donors who are au fait with digital currencies to consider philanthropy and helping the vulnerable.” This is not the first time a Red Cross society will accept cryptocurrency donations, as the American and British counterparts already accept crypto donations. However, unlike US donors, donors to the Singapore Red Cross do not receive tax deductions, and all donations received will be converted to fiat currency within one business day. Total market cap falls to $1.121 trillion | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on Tradingview.com Crypto adoption in Singapore is one of the highest in the Asia-Pacific region. According to a report, over half of Singapore’s Gen X members invest in cryptocurrencies. Another similar study done by Statista showed that around 19% of people in Singapore own crypto, higher than the global average of 15%. More than 31% of respondents also indicated that they owned Bitcoin, one of the highest in the world. The Rise of Crypto Philanthropy Crypto philanthropy has steadily grown over the past few years. Major organizations like the American Red Cross, and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital now take crypto donations. Crypto donations, in particular, have contributed a significant part of humanitarian efforts in the Ukraine war, with the country receiving more than $212 million worth of crypto.

42392759,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgB0tb,1691429991,"It's ChatGPT, but for Bitcoin: New AI Tool Avoids 'Hallucinations'","ChatBTC is an artificial-intelligence chatbot created by Bitcoin development shop Chaincode Labs and trained to answer questions about the dominant blockchain using “high-quality sources” of technical information.  Unlike Open AI’s ChatGPT product, this new chatbot is less likely to give incorrect answers or “hallucinate,” according to Chaincode Labs.  Looking for answers on Bitcoin? A new, specialized artificial intelligence or AI tool just released by the developer Chaincode Labs aims to provide a font of reliable information— in contrast to the more general and sometimes inaccurate responses that might come from the buzzy AI tool ChatGPT.  Bitcoin enthusiasts no longer have to scour the popular question-and-answer website Bitcoin Stack Exchange or muddle through the Bitcoin-dev mailing list looking for answers to technical questions about the dominant blockchain. Another source of frustration could come from typing queries into ChatGPT, the popular Q&A tool from OpenAI — because the origin of its intel isn't always fully attributed, and there's risk of both plagiarism and inaccurate or outdated responses.  Chaincode's new experimental service, which was launched last week, is called ChatBTC. It works as an alternative to ChatGPT, but is trained on a specific set of specialized and vetted Bitcoin resources, according to Art Assoiants, product manager at Chaincode Labs.  “It's for people who want high confidence in not just the quality of responses, but where those ideas come from,” Assoiants told CoinDesk. “ChatBTC is based on a curated set of high-signal resources that have been the traditional hosts of in-depth technical discourse.”  Artificial intelligence has become one of the hottest tech trends since the viral success of OpenAI’s ChatGPT late last year. OpenAI is an artificial intelligence research company and ChatGPT is its flagship chatbot, garnering more than 100 million users a mere two months after launching. ChatGPT is a large language model, or LLM — software that generates human-like text responses to user questions.  But OpenAI says the general-purpose ChatGPT “has limited knowledge of world events after 2021” and is dogged by “hallucinations,” inaccurate or even offensive answers to questions.  Read more: Lightning Labs Unveils Bitcoin Tools for AI  ChatBTC uses the same knowledge base as bitcoinsearch.xyz, also developed by Chaincode Labs, and Assoiants says it pulls resources from websites like Bitcoin Stack Exchange, Bitcoin Talk, the Bitcoin-dev and Lightning-dev mailing lists, Bitcoin Optech, Bitcoin Transcripts and a limited set of blogs.  The service is still in its early alpha phase according to Adam Jonas, head of special projects at Chaincode Labs.  “Please have mercy on this alpha,” Jonas posted on X (formerly Twitter). “There is a feedback form at the bottom if you'd like to help us improve. Not all the answers are 100% accurate.”  Introducing “Holocat”  On the homepage, users are greeted by a standard chat interface much like ChatGPT’s. Scrolling down gives users the option of chatting with a virtual feline by the name of “Holocat” for general answers. Users can also select an avatar of their favorite Bitcoin guru that responds only with answers previously provided by that avatar’s real-life personality. There are currently three Bitcoin Core contributors available for that option — Matt Corallo, Andrew Chow and Greg Maxwell.  “If you want to learn about partially signed Bitcoin transactions from the inventor of partially signed Bitcoin transactions, we can do that for you,” says a narrator in a video from Chaincode Labs showcasing ChatBTC. The narrator also adds, “It’s sort of hard to make this hallucinate.”  Unlike with ChatGPT, there’s no free version, but it's pretty inexpensive to use. After asking a few questions, users must pay at least 50 satoshis or “sats” – the blockchain’s smallest units (one bitcoin is 100 million sats) – per prompt, or roughly 1.5 cents per question at the time of reporting.  ChatBTC’s payment interface uses an obscure web standard called L402 that was recently configured to accept bitcoin payments. One of the developers working on that interface is Theophilus Isah.  “I spearheaded that part,” Isah told CoinDesk. “Although it still has some improvements.”  Isah and Assoiants collaborated with fellow contributors Urvish Patel, Emmanuel Itakpe and Stephen DeLorme to create the current version of ChatBTC.  Other Bitcoin-focused chatbots on the market include ChatBTC.dev and talk2satoshi (which appeared to be offline at the time of reporting), both less popular projects, based on social-media engagement on X.

42392749,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgAzzB,1691427962,I Have 1M Questions About the PayPal Stablecoin. Here Are 5,"So much for pausing development. On Monday morning, it was announced that global payments giant PayPal (PYPL) is launching PayPal USD (PYUSD), a U.S. dollar stablecoin fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S. Treasuries and similar cash equivalents.  There are so many theories and ideas flying around about this, and so, naturally, I have one million questions about PayPal’s U.S. stablecoin. Here are five.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Why would PayPal issue a stablecoin, despite regulatory uncertainty in the U.S.?  There’s certainly regulatory uncertainty in the U.S., but PayPal is big enough to actually influence regulators. Take a moment to reflect on the companies, stakeholders and individuals who are complaining about onerous crypto regulation stateside. It’s crypto natives and companies like Coinbase (COIN) and Circle, which set up Centre Consortium to issue the second-largest stablecoin USDC.  Meanwhile, the entrenched powers, like BlackRock (BLK), laugh in the face of regulatory uncertainty. The message from the big players is, “Thanks for trailblazing, y’all, but this is how you apply the pressure back.”  Realistically, the most cynical and simplistic view of American enterprise applies here: PayPal, a for-profit institution that tries to make money, is issuing a stablecoin because it thinks it can make money issuing a stablecoin. It is not exactly a small undertaking — likely involving its risk, compliance, legal, partnership and communications teams — but it’s not altruistic.  What are potential use cases and benefits of PYUSD for the average consumer?  This is a bit unclear at the moment. The potential uses and benefits for the average consumer for a truly decentralized U.S. dollar stablecoin are pretty supportable. With those, you have a borderless, (theoretically) uncensorable version of the world’s reserve currency that people excluded from traditional U.S. payment rails can use (like in, say, Argentina or Russia).  Fabulous. Cool.  But PayPal is rolling PYUSD out in the United States through Venmo. Venmo works only in the United States and requires a bank account to use. PYUSD use in Venmo is basically just another new way for banked Americans to transact with some digital representation of the U.S. dollar, which is basically how all PayPal products have operated since the company's founding.  See also: Matt Taibbi, PayPal's Deplatforming and the Case for Crypto | Opinion (2022)  That said, PYUSD will purportedly be able to be sent outside of PayPal’s walled garden over the Ethereum network. So perhaps individuals who are banned from using Venmo or PayPal in the United States could get their money off of PayPal via an Ethereum-based withdrawal of PYUSD.  In reality, PayPal would probably just not allow that (since, let’s face it, this stablecoin is not even pretending to be decentralized), but if getting frozen funds out of PayPal develops as a genuine use case for PYUSD, then the benefit of the virtuous cycle of an oppressive banking system will accrue to PayPal (and the consumer with the frozen funds).  Realistically, the use cases and benefits of PYUSD won’t apply to the consumer at all and will instead become some sort of wonky bank-end thing for financial institutions to exploit and use.  How will PYUSD make money?  PayPal and Venmo make money as payment processors, but PYUSD lives in stablecoin land and we know stablecoin issuers make money differently. Stablecoin issuers hold interest-bearing instruments with customer funds and give none of the yield to their customers. The issuer takes the spread. Thanks to rising interest rates, PYUSD has become a viable product for PayPal to pursue.  And with PayPal explicitly saying it will hold T-bills, the PYUSD move is in the end unsurprising with our 20/20 hindsight. Here’s a way to make money, so let’s make some money.  What does this mean for Circle, Tether and the digital dollar?  Here’s the big open question that I don’t have an answer for. Assuming PYUSD will be as popular as the hype around it suggests, Circle and Tether are in for some healthy competition.  From Circle’s perspective, a bigger company is coming for its crown as the “regulated” stablecoin and from Tether’s perspective a bigger company is coming for its crown as “the” stablecoin. Of course, the hype around PYUSD needs to be met with actual demand for this to change anything. That remains to be seen.  See also: Is PayPal Going to Fine You for Your Opinions? (2022)  As for a “digital dollar,” a hypothetical (and almost universally hated) Federal Reserve-issued central bank digital currency, or CBDC, here comes yet another dent against the retail version of the CBDC. Why would the U.S. government bother with a digital dollar when it could get a private enterprise to handle the logistics of payment flow and surveillance?  It wouldn’t.  The Big Question: Is something new or is this just “same old”?  Still, with all the fresh hype, some people maintain that this isn’t really much of anything. A tweet from Coin Center’s Neeraj Agrawal gets at this viewpoint indirectly:  Ask yourself: What is it that PayPal does now?  That’s right. PayPal lets people pay each other with a digital representation of a reserve of money held by the company. PYUSD isn’t new. This is just a new wrapper on the same old thing.

Crypto Influencer Reveals,"Worldcoin (WLD) has recently emerged as a subject of fervent discussion especially due to its biometric data collection through retina scans. Its launch came in amid the growing interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain technology as well as new tokens and projects constantly striving to stand out and make a significant impact. Among the voices guiding investors through the labyrinthine world of crypto is Jordi Alexander, a renowned crypto influencer and the chief alchemist of the Mantle Network. Recently, he stirred conversations by drawing a parallel between Worldcoin and LUNA, though not entirely for auspicious reasons. Related Reading: Short-Lived Hype: Worldcoin (WLD) Signups Dwindle Less Than A Week After Launch According to the crypto influencer, Worldcoin might just be the next LUNA given some factors that comes with the token’s objective which makes it similar to LUNA which was portrayed as a “new digital currency” that needed to “maximize adoption in order to become useful.” The most important thing you need to know about Worldcoin is that it aims to become a currency.

The Worldcoin Foundation envisions creating the largest decentralized identity and financial network on the globe. Central to this vision is Worldcoin’s native token, WLD. For the project to be successful, WLD’s widespread adoption is imperative, as is its ability to service the “Orbs” used in the new user onboarding process via retina scans. Lets put aside the eyeball scanning weirdness. And the VC allocations and Market Maker deals, the ZK-proofs and the Low-float tokenomics. —-> The crypto-economics of Worldcoin are ill-considered and potentially very dangerous. Here’s why $WLD might become the next $LUNA– 🧵 pic.twitter.com/0LTjJMGI8s — Jordi Alexander (@gametheorizing) July 29, 2023 In his discussion on Crypto Banter, Alexander elaborated on Worldcoin’s goal to position WLD as an alternative to fiat currencies. Their agenda to become a digital base currency mimics the aspirations that LUNA once held. The gravity of this comparison is substantial, especially when considering LUNA’s precipitous fall from grace due to financial challenges. Trillion-Dollar Bubble In The Making? While drawing parallels with LUNA, Alexander’s intent wasn’t to prophesize an equivalent success for Worldcoin but rather to signal the risks of potential downfall. A primary concern centers around the controversial methods that Worldcoin employs, notably, collecting biometric data through retina scans. The rapid appreciation of WLD’s value further compounds these concerns. Since its inception just over a week ago, the token’s value has surged significantly from $0.1 to as high as trading above $5. This growth has inevitably attracted a slew of investors, catapulting its market capitalization to more than $200 million. Related Reading: Why Worldcoin (WLD) And PEPE Dominate The Crypto Market Trends This Week It’s this velocity of growth, coupled with Worldcoin’s overarching ambition, that leads Alexander to opine that the cryptocurrency might be veering into “bubble” territory.

It was recently revealed that the 45th President had made somewhere between $500,000 and $1 million on the sale of his collection so far. It is not clear what Trump will use this money for. Some speculate that the sum is aimed at funding the former president’s legal battles. Donald Trump will be running for president again in the upcoming 2024 election, along with other pro-crypto candidates. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

15752071,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=546106,1691426211,BREAKING: Did Solana Miss A Golden Opportunity To Collaborate With PayPal’s PYUSD Stablecoin?,"Reports indicate that PayPal’s stablecoin, PYUSD, was originally intended to be launched in collaboration with FTX on the Solana blockchain in 2022. However, unforeseen circumstances led to a sudden suspension of these plans. The collaboration between PayPal and FTX for the initial issuance of PYUSD on Solana was unexpectedly put on hold. According to Colin Wu, the delay was primarily attributed to FTX’s unfortunate crash, which introduced uncertainty and prompted both parties to reevaluate their strategies. Solana Failure To Secure Partnership With PayPal Regulatory challenges arose due to the classification of main public chain tokens as securities by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), complicating the expansion of PYUSD to other Layer 1 (L1) blockchains. As a result, PayPal has now chosen to issue its stablecoin through the Paxos Trust Company, marking a significant shift in their original collaboration plans. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Sees 10% Pullback, But Here’s Why Rally Can Still Continue PayPal, renowned as a leading online payment platform, had diligently prepared to launch their stablecoin, PYUSD, with the assistance of cryptocurrency exchange FTX. The collaboration aimed to leverage the speed and scalability of the Solana blockchain, renowned for its throughput and low transaction fees. This partnership sought to unlock new possibilities for PayPal within the rapidly expanding realm of digital assets. Unfortunately, the collaborative efforts between PayPal and FTX were abruptly interrupted when FTX experienced a significant crash. This unforeseen event forced both parties to suspend their work on PYUSD issuance through the Solana blockchain. The crash created an atmosphere of uncertainty and caution, compelling PayPal and FTX to reassess their plans and explore alternative approaches. Moving forward, PayPal’s PYUSD stablecoin will now be issued by the Paxos Trust Company. Initially available to eligible US customers, this digital asset enables seamless transfers within the PayPal platform and compatible external wallets. Additionally, users can utilize PYUSD for purchases and exchange it for other prominent cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and more.

Overall, FTX’s crash and regulatory obstacles prompted PayPal to reconsider their strategy, leading to a shift in their issuance partnership to the Paxos Trust Company. As PayPal’s PYUSD stablecoin enters the market under this revised approach, it remains to be seen how this change in strategy will impact the stablecoin’s adoption and growth trajectory.

42392761,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgB0jL,1691426017,CPI Preview: Bitcoin Unlikely to Get Bullish Catalyst From July Inflation Data,"Bitcoin (BTC) bulls are hoping for continued good news on the U.S. inflation front from Thursday morning's July Consumer Price Index report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Economists expect a 0.2% increase on a monthly basis, the same increase as seen in June. Year-over-year growth is forecast at 3.3%, up from 3% in June. Headline inflation, which is not adjusted for seasonal factors and which includes often-volatile food and energy prices, peaked at 9.1% in June 2022 and was running at an 8.5% pace in July of last year.  Core CPI, which strips out more volatile food and energy costs, is expected to come in at 0.2% in July, matching June's figure. The annual core CPI pace is expected to slip to 4.7% from 4.8%. Core CPI peaked at 6.5% in March 2022, and one year ago in July, the annual level was 5.9%.  Listen: Looking Ahead to July CPI on Twitter Spaces  Aiming to tame galloping inflation in 2022, the Federal Reserve early last year embarked on a string of rate hikes, taking its fed-funds rate from a range of 0% to 0.25% to the current 5.25%-5.50%. That historic pace of monetary tightening was at least in part responsible for the big decline in the price of bitcoin, which has dropped from nearly $69,000 late in 2021 to close out 2022 at around $16,000.  While the largest cryptocurrency is up 75% so far this year, the bounce has been rather tepid given the enormity of the preceding decline, with bitcoin — now trading at about $29,000 — still off roughly 58% from its all-time high.  To the extent that Fed tightening helped bring along bitcoin's price crash, the slowing and perhaps end of that tightening has been seen as a factor in bitcoin's modest recovery. While low number from Thursday's CPI might reinforce that idea, short-term interest rate traders have already priced in no more rate hikes from the Fed this year. Estimates for next year from CME Group show traders are anticipating rate cuts from the U.S. central bank, perhaps as soon as February.

42392755,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgB0Op,1691425757,A Long-Awaited Crypto Tax Rule Was Written Months Ago. Why Isn’t it Proposed?,"The issuance of crypto tax documents – like traditional 1099 forms – was finally required in the law two years ago, but the delay in proposing it may mean it slips another year.  The new infrastructure could be difficult for the industry, though it could finally relieve regular investors’ fears of tax complications when they transact in cryptocurrencies.  Crypto investors and their brokerages are waiting for a U.S. tax rule that will completely overhaul how they report their cryptocurrency taxes, but the government isn’t offering any straight answers about its holdup even as prominent lawmakers clamor for the Treasury Department to finish the job.  In reality, the Treasury’s Internal Revenue Service (IRS) actually completed the proposal months ago – enough to get it through a formal internal review at the White House – but hasn’t taken the last step of issuing it publicly, and industry insiders are now wondering whether the White House has delayed the process while other crypto policy questions seized the spotlight in Washington.  When it comes out, the proposed rule will govern how crypto firms report information about customers’ tax positions – akin to traditional brokerages’ filings of 1099 forms that outline gains and losses. The industry’s potential worries include whether businesses will be asked to provide information they don’t have access to, or whether it will sweep in crypto companies that don’t have that kind of relationship with customers – such as mining operations.  But the bright side for the digital assets sector is that it potentially eliminates one of the central objections to crypto – that it’s hard for investors to work out the taxes. When crypto taxes are eventually handled in much the same way as other financial investments, many in the industry see that as another step toward proper government oversight in the U.S.  While the proposal may be ready to go, Cody Carbone, who leads the policy team at the Chamber of Digital Commerce, said that “pushback from the White House” may have held it back. He said there may have been fears of legitimizing the crypto industry with this rule while also debating oversight legislation for the digital assets markets and stablecoins – a congressional negotiation last month that the White House’s National Economic Council was said to have been a vigorous participant in. Still, Carbone said he’s heard the IRS may issue the proposed tax-reporting rules any day now.  “We're begging for these, because we want to know what we need to report, so we want to comply,” Carbone said.  The law  The 2021 law that mandates this rule – the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act – also called for a reporting requirement to fully identify people making crypto transactions worth more than $10,000. On the law’s requirements, there will be plenty of complicated questions to work out, such as how the firms deal with customers maneuvering funds with private wallets that the business can’t see into and how the broker records may deal with interactions on truly decentralized platforms.  “Treasury is working diligently to issue these important and complex regulations soon,” the department told CoinDesk when asked about the delay.  The White House didn’t respond to a request for comment.  “We shouldn't be in a cloud of uncertainty,” said Lawrence Zlatkin, head of the tax arm at Coinbase Inc. (COIN), which is among the most prominent U.S. companies that will be directed by the new system. ""Since our customers should be reporting crypto activity on their tax returns anyhow, we should be transparent and be able to give them the information so they can report it properly.""  He said Coinbase has some infrastructure in place and is as ready as it can be, and it’s looking forward to being able to help investors figure out their taxes. “It helps us tell our customers what their gains and losses are, how they should be reporting information, what’s taxable, what’s non-taxable, what they should be asking their tax adviser, so that when they do all the things they do on Coinbase, they at least have some certainty as to how this will be treated,” Zlatkin said.  The wait in the meantime is “actually pretty frustrating, since we can’t prepare if we don't know what these rules are going to be,” he said.  In December of 2022, the IRS had assured the industry that it could keep going under existing laws and regulations until the new tax rules are finalized. To that end, the agency said that “a notice of proposed rulemaking will be published that sets forth proposed regulatory text, explains the proposed rules, solicits public comments, and announces a public hearing.” Only after all that is done – including that unusual and potentially time-consuming step of a live hearing – can the agency start analyzing the public feedback to write a final version.  Longshot for 2024  Proposing, gathering public comments and ultimately implementing a new tax rule is a process that usually takes several months – and often much longer – potentially stretching the process well into next year. That would be beyond the 2023 tax season, though it was meant to be in place this year and ready for the 2024 filings.  ""The goal, if you read it, was that all these places needed to be collecting data during this current tax year, so they could generate these forms and hand them out,"" said Miles Fuller, a longtime former IRS lawyer who left last year to join TaxBit, a crypto-focused tax software company. If they still wanted to finish this for 2024 filings, he said, “you're really running tight on time.”  He said it was “very strange” to see the proposal go through its final pre-release steps and then remain locked up at the Treasury Department.  “It’s not realistic to think that these rules are going to be effective by Jan 1, 2024,” said Coinbase’s Zlatkin. He said it’s not just a matter of the industry adapting and complying, but also the IRS getting systems ready to absorb and analyze a significant new flood of data.  Some U.S. lawmakers aren’t ready to accept the requirements slipping to later tax years.  “Without quick action, your agencies are at risk of failing to meet their congressionally mandated deadlines for implementation of a final rule,” U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.) and others wrote in a letter last week to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Daniel Werfel, commissioner of the IRS. “We urge you to act swiftly to implement strong tax reporting rules for cryptocurrency brokers.”  The letter argued that setting up these requirements will net billions in tax dollars and let the IRS identify and pursue the worst tax cheats.  “Given the chance, tax evaders and the crypto intermediaries willing to aid them will continue to game the system, exploit loopholes, and siphon off billions of dollars a year from the U.S. government,” it said.  As for the industry’s fears that the proposal may cast too wide a net for “brokers” who have to comply, the Treasury did write a letter to lawmakers early last year that assured them it wasn’t trying to include businesses such as crypto miners that don’t typically have access to customer information.  For now, the IRS hasn’t openly thrown in the towel on a 2024 implementation.  “The IRS keeps telling us there’s no delay,” said Carbone. So, he said the industry’s accountants and tax service providers “are all planning right now as if these broker reporting rules are going to be implemented as it was passed.”  Read More: IRS: Crypto Staking Rewards Taxable Once Investor Gets Hands on Tokens",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/08/07/a-long-awaited-crypto-tax-rule-was-written-months-ago-why-isnt-it-proposed,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0228f48f345481c6eb51c437e52f21d1270dbcbc-4032x2268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392760,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgB0oT,1691420897,"Congress, Not the SEC, Should Set U.S. Digital Asset Policy","The blockchain industry has attracted more than its fair share of scammers and fraudsters. The past two years have been especially painful as the collapses of Luna, Three Arrows Capital and FTX have brought the industry to its knees.  Thankfully those of us with a long-term vision finally have a market structure bill from Congress to look forward to. However, this progress is being threatened by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is running a covert demolition job on the industry to protect its turf and advance the political aspirations of the current chairman.  Matt Walsh is a founding partner of Castle Island Ventures, a venture capital firm that invests in blockchain technology companies. Prior to founding Castle Island Ventures he worked at Fidelity Investments, where he led a number of the firm’s blockchain projects.  The SEC’s three-part mandate is to 1) protect investors, 2) maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets and 3) facilitate capital formation. The SEC is supposed to be a disclosure-based regulator that is technology neutral, meaning they establish a framework for issuers to divulge pertinent information to investors, but do not unilaterally take a stance on which technologies ought to make it to market.  However, under this administration it is behaving like a merit-based regulator that sees itself as the arbiter of which technologies should exist in the United States. And it is doing this covertly by manipulating esoteric but consequential rules.  I have worked in the digital asset industry for over a decade and have been investing in blockchain startups for over six years. At Castle Island Ventures we have invested in over 50 startups, many that operate at the intersection of traditional finance and public blockchains.  Startups are moving offshore due to regulatory uncertainty  Based on our vantage point, it’s clear that the policies of the SEC are putting more U.S. investors in harm’s way by preventing trusted institutions from offering services, markets less orderly by forcing innovation offshore and impeding capital formation by throwing up unnecessary roadblocks for U.S. companies. In other words: the agency’s actions are negating precisely what it was founded to do.  Every day I speak with startups that are moving offshore and established firms delaying hiring plans due to regulatory uncertainty.  To be clear, the SEC has an important enforcement role to play in this market and should continue to root out the bad actors. Unfortunately, instead it has embarked on a plan to regulate via enforcement and rulemaking in lieu of working with Congress to enact market structure reforms. The result of the SEC’s so-called “guidance” and aggressive stance would be to create an environment where even the most trusted financial institutions are not able to operate digital asset businesses in the United States.  With recent proposed updates to the longstanding “custody rule” and new qualifications affecting broker-dealers, the SEC is covertly sidestepping Congress and seeking to regulate digital assets out of existence. This is backdoor rulemaking par excellence. Specifically, the SEC is doing the following:  Obscure accounting rules locking out custody banks  In the first quarter of 2022, the SEC published Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121), which sought to update how institutions maintain customer records. The guidance states any bank that files financial information with the SEC must record customer funds as assets on the bank’s own balance sheet—running counter to the way banks are required to record every other asset.  Although the policy has wide reaching effects, it raises particular concerns for the crypto industry. To this point the Bank of New York Mellon stated in an SEC comment letter: “banks cannot practically serve as qualified custodians for digital assets in any sufficient scale if they are still subject to the threshold limitations of SAB 121.”  We need more Bank of New York Mellons and fewer FTXs  It is a punitive policy to the point of rendering any digital asset business unprofitable, in part because of the corresponding capital charge related to holding the customer assets on balance sheet.  As a result of SAB 121, the SEC has created a dynamic where the most trusted U.S. custodians are not able to offer their customers digital asset custody services. This is the opposite of investor protection. We need more Bank of New York Mellons and fewer FTXs.  Targeting Coinbase by pressuring state trust custodians  In the first quarter of 2023, the SEC proposed changes to the “custody rule” section of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. In the proposed rule, the SEC asks whether the definition of qualified custodians should be narrowed to only include banks or savings associations that are subject to Federal regulation. A change of this nature would prevent institutions like Fidelity and Coinbase, which operate under New York’s trust framework and have acted as qualified custodians for years, from holding assets for registered investment advisors.  Given that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has only approved one company as a digital asset custodian, the federal path does not appear to be a workable option. This rule change would artificially and unnecessarily shrink the custody market in the U.S. and force a shutdown of some of the most trusted companies in the industry.  Hostility toward open-source software and financial transparency  In the second quarter of this year, the SEC re-opened the comment period on a controversial update it had tried to force through. Last year, the SEC rewrote the definition of “exchange” under the Exchange Act of 1934 with the effect that decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols could have been regulated as exchanges. Given that these protocols are operated by open-source software, the rule change would be a de facto ban on DeFi in the United States because few founding teams could comply with the onerous requirements.  This rule would be like banning commercial web browsers in the early days of the internet, in favor of front ends that were run by telephone companies. In addition to being questionably unconstitutional, this would firmly ensure that the next big blockchain-based technology platforms are built outside of the United States.  The path forward  If the SEC is ultimately successful in its regulation via enforcement and rule-making campaign, we will live in a country where the most secure banks cannot touch crypto, where state trusts like Fidelity Digital Assets are no longer deemed to be qualified custodians and where financial open-source software is closed off.  The United States blocking the emergence of the digital asset industry does not mean that the industry will not exist. It just means that it will flourish elsewhere. The E.U., U.K., Singapore and Australia have already passed regulatory frameworks for digital assets. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has gone so far as to publicly tell banks to support licensed crypto exchanges.  Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle have seen the geopolitical importance and promise of blockchain technology and have promised legislation to protect it from our nation’s regulators. Among the most promising are bills focused on market structure and stablecoin issuance, which if passed will provide clarity on the key issues preventing banks and broker-dealers from participating in the digital asset market today.  These are public policy issues that should be addressed via legislation by our elected officials in Congress, not regulated in an opaque manner by the SEC.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Matt Walsh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/08/07/congress-not-the-sec-should-set-us-digital-asset-policy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6a83e32facafa47cb7bec6b310d7960c46cef324-2048x1338.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

But here are some metrics that suggest the rally could still continue. Shiba Inu On-Chain Metrics Have Seen Positive Developments Recently Shiba Inu had been stuck in a perpetual sideways trend during most of July, but the meme coin’s fate switched in the first few days of this month as its price showed some strong upwards momentum. In this rally, the asset had managed to breach the $0.00001000 level, meaning that it had risen almost 30% in a matter of days. The coin, however, couldn’t keep this rise up and soon hit a local top, and since then, SHIB has been moving down. The below chart shows how Shiba Inu has performed during the past month: Looks like the value of the asset has shot up in recent days | Source: SHIBUSD on TradingView As you can see in the graph, while SHIB has seen a notable 10% drawdown since the top around two days back, the full gains of the rally haven’t been wiped out just yet. Shiba Inu is still around 9% up during the past week, which makes it by far the best-performing coin among the top assets by market cap, as most of the sector has in fact gone into the red in this period. Investors of SHIB’s eternal rival, Dogecoin, for instance, are 5% underwater in the past seven days. When looking at only the last 24 hours, though, the meme coin is the worst-performing top coin, as it has registered losses of around 5%. So it’s possible that Shiba Inu has already lost its steam and the asset would gradually keep declining until all the profits of the rally are retraced. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Rebound Anytime Soon? Here’s What On-Chain Data Says Data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, however, might provide a glimmer of hope to the meme coin’s holders, as some positive developments seem to have occured in the coin’s underlying metrics. The data for the SHIB trading volume and exchange supply | Source: Santiment on X There are two indicators of interest here: the “trading volume” and the “supply on exchanges.” The former of these is the measure of the total amount of SHIB that investors are transacting on the blockchain right now, while the latter keeps track of the total number of coins sitting in the wallets of all centralized exchanges. From the chart, it’s visible that the trading volume has shot up for the asset recently. This is a sign that there is a high amount of interest around Shiba Inu right now, which could potentially help fuel more price surges. Related Reading: Bitcoin NVT Shows Bearish Crossover, Price Drop Incoming? The supply of exchanges, on the other hand, has registered a decline at the same time. This is also likely to be constructive for the meme coin, as these platforms are what investors use for selling-related purposes. Since holders are withdrawing their coins from them (possibly for holding onto the SHIB for extended periods), the selling pressure in the market as a whole may be going down. It’s far from a guarantee, but if these factors continue to stay favorable in the coming days, then a bounce back for the Shiba Inu rally may become more probable.

The investments were made through the sixth season of the Most Valuable Builder (MVB) incubator program.  Last week included an unusually high number of fundraises that didn’t include a monetary amount, so it's not possible to tally up the overall amount raised with any accuracy. Conductive.ai was one of the unspecified rounds, launching an engagement platform for game developers with the financial backing of Web3 gaming giant Animoca Brands.  Companies that did disclose the amount raised included D8X, a Polygon-based and backed DEX that raised $1.5 million in a pre-seed round. Privacy-focused infrastructure provider ZkPass raised $2.5 million in a seed round that included Sequoia China and Binance Labs. CeFi payments platform Orbital raised $6.4 million. Solv Protocol, which allows institutions and venture capitalists to sell tokenized financial products, secured $6 million in a round that included a subsidiary of banking giant Nomura Securities.  The data in the table below includes information that was current as of 5pm ET on Friday, Aug. 4. Any deals announced after that time will go into next week’s roundup.

The fund aimed to raise $200 million and primarily targeted high net worth individuals. This approach marked a departure for Sino, as it was the first time the firm sought outside capital through a formal fund vehicle.  In marketing material promoting the fund, FTX was described in the slide deck as a ""co-GP and anchor LP"", with the potential to unlock ""significant strategic value"" through exposure to Bankman-Fried’s universe of tokens. As of January 2022, the fund had already raised $90 million, with FTX as an anchor investor.  Initially, Sino Global said that its “direct exposure to FTX exchange was confined to mid-seven figures held in custody.”  Bankman-Fried was listed as an indirect investor in the fund on SEC filings from 2022, alongside Alameda Research, subsidiary Alameda Ventures and Graham.  As of 2023, the fund is no longer registered with the SEC though it remains active with the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority.  A spokesperson for Sino Global previously told CoinDesk that a significant focus of the fund's investing efforts has been on infrastructure and gaming.  Shortly after the collapse of FTX, Sino released a statement saying that it “trusted FTX to be a good actor committed to pushing the industry forward. “We deeply regret that misplaced trust.”  In mid-July, Sino Global announced that it had hired former FTX COO Constance Wang, once described as Bankman-Fried’s “right hand” in his fundraising drive, to be its head of gaming.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | RESEARCH,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/07/sino-global-files-67m-claim-against-ftx-alameda,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ab31bd208c34356730fb03d8e480ab1fd4ce39f6-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a monthly report by Lido, the number of unique ether depositors surpassed 166,000, representing a 6.66% increase this past month. Lido’s TVL passed $15 billion on July 14, though due to the recent decline in the price of ether it stands at $14.81 billion at press time.  The increase in both measures comes as the number of staked ETH (stETH) in decentralized finance (DeFi) liquidity pools slid more than 53% to about 161,000.  DeFi traders typically keep their attention on liquidity, because it measures how easily crypto investors can access stETH.  The drop in liquidity in DeFi pools was “ largely because of the uncertainty surrounding Curve exploit/situation with many LPs [liquidity providers] withdrawing until there’s more clarity,” said Kasper Rasmussen, Lido marketing lead, to CoinDesk in a Telegram message.  Curve Finance, a decentralized stablecoin exchange, lost more than $73 million in a recent hack, causing spillover effects to other entities in the crypto ecosystem, including Lido. Curve has since recouped about 73% of the stolen funds.  Despite the decrease in stETH in DeFi liquidity pools, the demand for stETH remains strong for lending protocols and layer 2 rollups. Market participants not only want to back their loans with LST collateral, they also are looking to bridge their LST to layer 2 rollups, evidenced by Aave holding over 736,000 stETH, per Nansen, as well as “Arbitrum and Optimism bridges experiencing increases of 16.58% and 10.23% in wstETH deposits, respectively,” the report says.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MINING | ARB,Sage D.

42392748,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgB0EZ,1691418169,"Some Users May Want an ‘Everything App’, but What We Need Is Digital Sovereignty","In late July, Twitter’s logo suddenly changed to an X, followed by Elon Musk’s official announcement. “Twitter” is officially no more, and the website used by millions around the world is now called “X.”  According to the platform’s CEO Linda Yaccarino, the rebranding was the next step toward “the future state of unlimited interactivity,” morphing Twitter into “a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services and opportunities” — a unified “everything app.”  Jameson Lopp is the chief technology officer of and co-founder of Casa, a self custody service.  But who asked for this?  At a time when our lives are only becoming increasingly digital, why should we hand all of our information to centralized, opaque organizations that have a track record of using it unethically? Sure, these services can be profoundly convenient, and many people undoubtedly enjoy having one user-friendly application that can manage so much of their digital and real lives, but what’s the price?  Is convenience worth our freedom?  The idea of Twitter as an “everything app” was seemingly inspired by the popular Chinese platform WeChat, which allows users not only to chat, make calls and send media but also to make payments and access a wide range of financial and personal services. As Elon Musk has said, “You basically live on WeChat in China. If we can recreate that with Twitter, we’ll be a great success.”  Despite sounding convenient on paper, there’s a genuine concern about what happens when you use a single point of access for your entire digital world. If you do anything deemed “unacceptable” – generally by algorithms designed by people you will never know – you can be cut off in a second, often with little to no recourse.  Each and every individual should be able to decide for themselves how to approach their presence online.  Last October, for example, some WeChat users in China reported that they were banned from the platform entirely – effectively “killing” their digital self – just for reposting some “questionable” banners condemning Xi Jinping. More recently, X itself literally hijacked a 16-year-old account that used the @x handle, replacing its name with @x12345678998765 — without any prior warnings, consent or compensation.  Twitter’s rebranding was happening alongside the launch of Meta’s new community messaging service called Threads. It joined Meta’s other social media offerings including Facebook and Instagram and is designed for sharing text updates and joining public conversations in competition with X.  Considering Meta’s complicated history with customer data, it’s unsurprising that many are concerned that Threads is simply a new avenue for information gathering and potential abuse. Many big tech companies like Meta and X have tried to create “everything platforms” by expanding into new products because being present in users’ day-to-day lives is a way to gather untold gigabytes of data on people worldwide.  But without owning your account, “everything” can be unilaterally taken away in an instant and “everything” becomes a single point of surveillance and potential failure.  The case for digital sovereignty  Examples like these help showcase the problem of centralized services holding full control over user access — but what’s the solution? Digital sovereignty.  As almost every aspect of our lives becomes digitized, the ability to control and manage your own data isn’t just a privilege anymore; it’s a human right.  Fortunately, one of the major boons of blockchain and other cryptographic breakthroughs is the ability to disintermediate big tech platforms and take charge of your identity and data. It’ll no doubt take a while for the masses to really grasp the gravity of this, but more are coming around to the notion. For the already enlightened, platforms exist that cater to this type of digital sovereignty.  Nostr, for example, is a protocol for sharing data like simple text posts, and it doesn’t rely on servers operated by any one entity. Nostr isn’t itself a blockchain, but the entire system is built around cryptographic keys and signatures to authorize and track events posted by pseudonymous identities — much like Bitcoin. (If you’d like to do a deeper dive into just what Nostr is and how it works, I’ve written about this at length before.)  What makes Nostr important for this discussion is the fact that it offers a true path to censorship-resistant social media as well as digital sovereignty. Yes, there are some other platforms that claim to offer a similar experience, but to ensure you can’t be deplatformed you must run your own server which is typically a major bottleneck to adoption.  See also: Decentralized Social Media Project Nostr's Damus Gets Listed on App Store  Nostr doesn't require people to bootstrap servers and so is comparatively very easy to start using. You simply choose your client, be it a web browser or some app, create your public and private keys and can immediately begin surfing through content from other users or post your own. Different clients will provide somewhat varying experiences – some more technical, some rather streamlined – but many will seem quite familiar to anyone with at least some social media experience.  See also: Nostr: A Decentralized Censorship-Resistant Twitter  At this point, the experience is like Twitter. You get the same basic service with no ads and no threat of data harvesting whatsoever. Furthermore, considering a social network is only as good as the people who use it, you may be surprised just how many famous names are already involved with Nostr. Most notably perhaps is Jack Dorsey, the original creator of Twitter. There are even services that allow Twitter users to import anyone they follow who have linked their accounts to Nostr. This makes switching easy and can get current Twitter users free from centralization in no time.  The journey begins  Ultimately, each and every individual should be able to decide for themselves how to approach their presence online. Some may prioritize convenience and continue to use platforms like Twitter/X and its peers, while others may see the writing on the wall and decide that their digital sovereignty is more important.  Hopefully, by continuing to build and attract more people, we can create powerful alternatives to toxic social media today that challenge even the biggest centralized services.

Starting on August 10, at 12:00 pm UTC, every participant of the crypto, blockchain, and Web3 space will have access to the most sophisticated AI with on-chain and off-chain capabilities to date. What is the ChainGPT V1? Acting as an AI powered operating system of fundamental tools for traders, investors, researchers, developers, and everyone in between, the ChainGPT V1 is a dashboard that encompasses the full suite of ChainGPT products including the NFT Generator, smart contract auditor, and chat assistant, with its ecosystem components including the ChainGPT DAO, the staking modules, and API access that will facilitate a new generation of informational management and discovery for all in the crypto and blockchain space. The ultimate hub for Crypto AI Tools. What are some of the V1 Features? Loaded with all of the individual products ChainGPT has released over the last few months, the V1 web app has a rich set of functionality that builds on previous versions of ChainGPT. AI Chatbot Already deployed throughout a multitude of Web3 communities via Telegram and Discord, the ChainGPT AI Chatbot has already become a staple as an interactive, dynamic database for engaging and entertaining users. With the release of the V1 the Chatbot is receiving an upgrade with new capabilities & bug fixes that supersede its predecessor beta version. Its capabilities now extend across a much broader range of sources for gathering live Web3 news and insights. It will be able to conduct much deeper, more granular market analysis through the application of technical indicators (such as the RSI and EMA) to aid traders and investors in their research. It has been tuned to track all major launchpad and IDO platforms, providing a more holistic view of the startup landscape. Initially having a surface level set of assets that were limited in scope, the upgraded chatbot has been plugged in to service over 5,000 coins/tokens (and will be constantly expanding). As it pertains to the bug fixes, all minor and major points of friction for the users have been mended. Response times have been compressed, accuracy has been calibrated for higher contextual fidelity, and error potential has been minimized. Master Dashboard User experience with slow, clunky and disorganized applications has kept many away from participating in the world of Web3; ChainGPT decided to approach this problem head on and was able to construct what might be the most complete AI interface in the industry. Integrating every $CGPT application, while being able to neatly package the visual elements without disrupting its aesthetics, the V1 dashboard is transforming user accounts into AI-powered Web3 operating systems. Automated AI Newsfeed Staying up-to-date in the fast paced crypto, blockchain, and Web3 space has been notoriously challenging, until now. The first (and only) of its kind, ChainGPT’s automated AI newsfeed has been developed from the ground up to deliver the most complete informational experience. Scanning the entire internet, the ChainGPT AI newsfeed aggregates all the leading trusted outlets and social sources, digests the information, and produces succinct summarizations in an comprehensive manner. Prompt Marketplace An AI is only as useful as the prompt that it is given. Quickly becoming one of the most sought after skills in the greater tech industry, prompting is a form of vernacular art; in fact prompts have become a digital asset class of its own. Catering to the evolving demands of AI communities, the V1 dashboard is equipped with its own prompt marketplace, becoming a focal point for the exchange of generative AI ideas. Users will be able to buy, bell, & trade prompts with the expansive $CGPT community; effectively adding a vector for users to monetize their skills. AI NFT Generator ChainGPT released the first ever AI NFT Generator on June 1st, with already over 4,500,000 NFTs generated! In the evolving landscape of digital art, ChainGPT's AI NFT Generator stands out as an avant-garde tool, seamlessly melding technology with artistic expression. With just a simple text prompt, this groundbreaking generator harnesses the power of advanced AI to bring to life high-quality NFT collections, ranging from distinctive single pieces to vast galleries of up to 10,000 NFTs, all within an astonishing 30 to 60 seconds. Offering unparalleled versatility, it supports a myriad of platforms including BNB Chain, opBNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, and Ethereum. While individual NFT creation and minting are graciously offered for free, those aiming to craft expansive 10,000 NFT collections can easily do so under the umbrella of ChainGPT's Freemium or Paid plans. The ChainGPT AI NFT Generator is not just a tool—it's a revolution, redefining the boundaries of what's possible in the world of NFT creation. AI Powered Solidity Smart-Contracts Auditor & Generator Navigating the intricate realm of Solidity smart-contracts just became remarkably intuitive with ChainGPT's cutting-edge AI models and tools. Whether you're looking to birth a new contract or rigorously assess an existing one, ChainGPT simplifies the process. Users can effortlessly generate tailor-made smart-contracts by merely articulating their requirements, eliminating the technical jargon and complexities traditionally associated with such tasks. Similarly, auditing a contract is now as straightforward as presenting its code to ChainGPT's AI. This innovation heralds a new era, making the creation and assessment of Solidity smart-contracts more accessible and efficient than ever before. Membership and Access The V1 release will be engaging a three tier membership system based on what applications and the degree of access that users desire to have. Free Plan The basic configuration of functions granted to every account on the V1. Restricted from the more advanced applications, the free plan provides limited access to five of the core applications including the General AI model (chatbot), the news feed, the Ask Crypto People app, Single NFT Generation, and participation in the prompt marketplace. PPP Plan The pay-per-prompt plan offers unlimited, flexible access to the entire application suite. Smart Contact auditing and generations, multi-NFT (collection) generation, the trading assistant, as well as everything in the free plan. Freemium Plan The Freemium plan requires that users accumulate 20,000 CGPTsp by staking $CGPT tokens. This plan provides 20,000 monthly CGPT credits for use as needed throughout any and every single application. In addition to the full product suite, users at the Freemium level will also be granted DAO proposal rights, allowing them to submit ideas for the ChainGPT DAO to vote on. In order to unlock the full spectrum of functionality, a user will be able to swiftly create their accounts by linking their Web3 wallets (Metamask, Trust Wallet, Rainbow wallet, etc..)

42392744,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgAzov,1691417663,Bitcoin Remains King While Crypto Hedge Funds Get Rekt,"Investors would have benefited more from buying and holding bitcoin (BTC) than from investing in crypto hedge funds during the first half of 2023, according to a research report from Swiss-based crypto investment adviser 21e6 Capital.  Crypto funds returned an average of 15% during the period versus an 83% gain for bitcoin, according to 21e6 Capital data provided to Bloomberg. Funds with directional strategies returned an average of 22%, well below bitcoin but above the 6.8% return on market-neutral strategies that often attempt to follow market trends, a difficult proposition in choppy markets.  The funds struggled against the sudden closure of multibillion-dollar crypto exchange FTX in November, the closure of three crypto-friendly banks earlier this year and the continued turbulence around potential regulations.  “It is plain to see that a simple buy-and-hold investment into bitcoin would have outperformed all of these fund baskets. Bitcoin added about 80% in value by the half of the year,” 21e6 Capital due diligence manager Jan Spörer and sales and marketing head Maximilian Bruckner wrote in the report. “In previous bull runs, crypto hedge funds were frequently able to significantly outperform the bitcoin benchmark. How can underperformance among professionally managed crypto funds be such a widespread phenomenon?”  The complex answer involves the fact that crypto hedge funds went into the year with larger-than-typical cash positions to help mitigate risks after the collapse of FTX, which made reaction times slower. The underperformance of altcoins — or cryptocurrencies not named bitcoin or ether (ETH) — also took a toll on hedge funds.  21e6 Capital tracks more than 700 crypto funds globally as well as the regulatory performance reports of 123 funds across 70 firms.

However, amidst this downturn, prominent crypto YouTuber and XRP analyst, Alex Cobb, has set an ambitious price target of $10 for the digital asset, employing the Elliott Wave Theory to analyze its monthly price chart. Related Reading: PEPE’s Future: Will Prices Of Meme Coins Continue To Drop? Source: Coingecko Understanding Elliott Wave Theory Elliott Wave Theory is a technical analysis approach that seeks to predict price movements in financial markets by identifying recurring patterns in market sentiment. It is named after its creator, Ralph Nelson Elliott, who proposed that market prices unfold in repetitive patterns of five upward waves, called impulse waves, and three downward corrective waves. These waves are believed to reflect the psychology of market participants, alternating between optimism and pessimism. XRP/USD 30-day price chart. Source: FXstreet/TradingView Amidst the bearish sentiment surrounding XRP, Cobb’s prediction of a $10 price target showcases his optimism and faith in the potential of the cryptocurrency. Cobb’s application of Elliott Wave Theory to the monthly price chart of XRP has led him to believe that a significant upward movement is on the horizon, potentially taking the price to unprecedented levels. Ripple’s Expanding Ecosystem Despite the current market challenges, Ripple, the company behind XRP, has been making notable strides in expanding its ecosystem. A major boost came in the form of Ripple’s membership acquisition in the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), granting access to a massive derivatives market. This move has positioned Ripple among over a thousand member institutions from 79 countries, potentially opening new avenues for XRP’s adoption.

These developments, coupled with the company’s strides in technology and collaborations, drive the adoption of XRP tokens across various use cases.

All indications are that Saylor's company will continue adding to its bitcoin stash.  When Michael Saylor stepped down almost exactly a year ago as CEO of MicroStrategy (MSTR), the software maker he founded in 1989, to become its executive chairman with a sole focus on investing in bitcoin (BTC), his digital-asset strategy was looking pretty bleak.  He had already spent billions of dollars of MicroStrategy’s money to purchase bitcoin — and his paper loss amounted to about $1 billion. Bitcoin had sunk to below $23,000, less than MicroStrategy’s average price paid: $30,664.  The bitcoin bubble had burst and questions circulated about how painful things might get for MicroStrategy, given that it had taken on debt to buy the cryptocurrency. And things got even worse after his August 2022 job change. Crypto exchange FTX collapsed months later, taking bitcoin below $16,000 and giving Wall Street credit analysts reason to evaluate just how distressed MicroStrategy was getting.  Read more: Michael Saylor Lost Big in the Dot-Com Bubble and Bitcoin's Crash. Now He Aims to Rebound Again  Today, though, MicroStrategy’s position looks brighter as bitcoin’s price has rebounded to above $29,000.  Saylor has bought more. MicroStrategy now owns 152,800 bitcoins, up from 129,699 when he surrendered the CEO job. Those new purchases have lowered MicroStrategy’s cost basis to $29,672.  Bottom line: MicroStrategy is nearly back in the black with bitcoin. And its stock price has recovered some, too. It’s around $390 now versus $270 a year ago (though still down from its 2021 high of nearly $1,300).  Saylor had begun purchasing bitcoin for MicroStrategy’s balance sheet in August 2020, fueling its stock rally alongside bitcoin in 2020 and 2021. Taking a wider view, Saylor this week pointed out that MicroStrategy’s share price is up 254% since he first began making bitcoin purchases, well ahead of the Nasdaq’s 31% advance and gains by individual tech stocks like Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), which are each higher by 60% to 76%, during that time.  Looking forward to the second anniversary of Saylor’s exit from an operational role at his company, MicroStrategy will likely own substantially more bitcoin than it does now as the company this week announced a $750 million share sale, the proceeds of which will be used in part to purchase more of the crypto.  Beyond buying more bitcoin and being one of the original cryptocurrency’s biggest evangelists, Saylor has spent some of his energy this year working to expand the adoption of the Lightning Network, a layer-2 scaling system designed to make bitcoin payments cheaper and faster.  In April, he integrated that Lightning Network into his corporate email address, allowing anyone to send the billionaire bitcoin to saylor@microstrategy.com. While he likely doesn’t need anyone’s bitcoin, the move was meant to show the ease of use of the Lightning Address protocol, which lets developers replace a standard Lightning invoice, or payment request, with an internet identifier such as an email address.  “Are you disappointed bitcoin is still at $30,000?” Saylor was asked this week on CNBC, with the interviewer noting its inability to break to higher prices even with speedy inflation, exploding government debt and apparent growing institutional acceptance. Zoom out, Saylor replied. Bitcoin was not far over $10,000 when MicroStrategy began buying three years ago. “We’re glad we adopted bitcoin.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,"Stephen Alpher, Lyllah Ledesma",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/08/07/michael-saylors-bitcoin-billions-have-rebounded-since-he-exited-ceo-job-a-year-ago,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c7f82e9703cdbe055355ed17ba34d24d820a4f66-4785x2692.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

15745774,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=546039,1691413255,"Solana Products See Strong Inflows, Bitcoin And Crypto Lose $107 Million","The past week has painted a vivid picture of shifting investor sentiment worldwide. While Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market witnessed a significant outflow of funds from investment products like ETPs, ETFs and funds, Solana (SOL) emerged as a beacon of hope for altcoin enthusiasts. A Dive Into The Numbers By Crypto Products Digital asset investment products experienced a net outflow of $107 million this week, a figure that underscores the growing trend of profit-taking that has been evident in recent weeks. “Digital asset investment products saw outflows this week, totalling $107m with profit taking gathering pace in recent weeks,” James Butterfill noted in his recent report published in CoinShares’ blog. Bitcoin, the de facto king of cryptocurrencies, bore the brunt of these outflows, seeing a staggering $111.4 million leave its coffers. This marks the “largest weekly outflows since March,” a time when US regulatory scrutiny began to intensify. Interestingly, for the first time in 14 weeks, the outflows into short bitcoin positions have also come to a halt. Related Reading: Solana Price Could Surge To $30 Upon Overcoming This Resistance Ethereum wasn’t spared either. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization saw outflows totalling $5.9 million, bringing the combined outflows for both Bitcoin and Ethereum to $117.3 million in just the past week. Solana Is The Rising Star Amidst this backdrop of outflows, Solana stood out, not just for its resilience, but for its impressive inflows. The altcoin witnessed the “largest inflows, totaling $9.5m, the largest single week of inflows since March 2022.” This surge in interest has propelled Solana’s Assets Under Management (AUM) to $89 million. With month-to-date inflows equalling $9.5 million and year-to-date inflows at $25 million, Solana is clearly on an upward trajectory. To put this in perspective, Bitcoin has the largest AUM with $24,136 million, followed by Ethereum with $7,820 million and multi-asset investment products with $3,060 million. Litecoin ($134 million) and Bitcoin Short ($104) also have bigger AUM than Solana. However, Solana’s AUM has now surpassed that of established altcoins like XRP ($74 million), Cardano ($28 million), and Polygon ($24 million). Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Records Positive Moves As Bears Took Control, What’s Pushing It? While Solana basked in the limelight, other altcoins had a mixed week. XRP and Litecoin registered modest inflows of $0.5 million and $0.46 million respectively. However, Uniswap and Cardano weren’t as fortunate, witnessing outflows of $0.8 million and $0.3 million respectively. Regionally, the outflows were predominantly concentrated among two ETP providers in Germany and Canada, which saw outflows of $71 million and $29 million respectively. SOL Price Analysis At press time, the Solana (SOL) price was trading at $23.05, above the 200-day EMA. If SOL manages to defend the 200-day EMA in the following days and confirm the breakout from the descending triangle, the chart looks very bullish. The next resistance level can be expected at the 50% Fibonacci retracement level ($24.00), before another move to the 61.8% Fibonacci level at $27.44 seems possible.

The Ethereum-based token will soon be available to PayPal users in the U.S. This is the first time a major financial company is issuing its own stablecoin. Users can transfer PYUSD between PayPal and supported external digital wallets, use the tokens to pay for goods and services or convert any of PayPal's supported cryptocurrencies to and from PYUSD.  Read more: What Is a Stablecoin?  PayPal said the stablecoin will be available to an ""already large and growing community of external developers, wallets and web3 applications,"" and can be easily adopted by crypto exchanges.  PYUSD will be issued by New York-based crypto financial-services firm Paxos Trust and will be fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term Treasuries and similar cash equivalents. It is redeemable for dollars and can also be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies available on PayPal’s network, such as bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), ether (ETH) and litecoin (LTC).  PayPal paused work on its stablecoin project in February amid regulatory scrutiny, according to Bloomberg.  ""The shift toward digital currencies requires a stable instrument that is both digitally native and easily connected to fiat currency like the U.S. dollar,"" PayPal CEO Dan Schulman said in the statement. ""Our commitment to responsible innovation and compliance, and our track record delivering new experiences to our customers, provides the foundation necessary to contribute to the growth of digital payments through PayPal USD.""  PYUSD will be first available on PayPal and then on its popular Venmo app.  “This announcement is a clear signal that stablecoins — if issued under a clear regulatory framework — hold promise as a pillar of our 21st century payments system,” Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-North Carolina), chair of the House Financial Services Committee, said in a statement.  One of the worst-performing stocks in the Nasdaq –—down 10% this year despite a major bull market and off 14% last week following a disastrous earnings report — PayPal has managed a 1.6% bounce on the news.  Meanwhile, PayPal said it will provide attested reports of the funds backing the stablecoin in an effort to thwart concerns about unbacked tokens.  ""Beginning in September 2023, Paxos will publish a public monthly Reserve Report for PayPal USD that outlines the instruments composing the reserves,"" PayPal said in its release. ""Paxos will also publish a public third-party attestation of the value of PayPal USD reserve assets.  ""The attestation will be issued by an independent third-party accounting firm and conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants,"" it added.

42392765,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgB1E7,1691410809,First Mover Americas: Michael Saylor's Wager on Bitcoin Looking Better,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  A rebound in the price of bitcoin has sharply narrowed losses for MicroStrategy's (MSTR) holdings of the cryptocurrency. When Michael Saylor stepped down almost exactly a year ago as CEO of MicroStrategy to become its executive chairman with a sole focus on investing in bitcoin, his digital-asset strategy was looking pretty bleak. He had already spent billions of dollars of MicroStrategy’s money to purchase bitcoin — and his paper loss amounted to about $1 billion. Today, though, MicroStrategy’s position looks brighter as bitcoin’s price has rebounded to above $29,000. Saylor has bought more. MicroStrategy now owns 152,800 bitcoins, up from 129,699 when he surrendered the CEO job. The new purchases have lowered MicroStrategy’s cost basis to $29,672. Bottom line: MicroStrategy, a software company that has become a proxy for bitcoin's price because of its largest holdings of the cryptocurrency, is nearly back in the black with bitcoin.  A spokesperson for Huobi is denying reports that several executives were arrested in China as outflow from the exchange picks up. Over the weekend, financial media in Hong Kong reported that several executives at Huobi had been taken away by police in China. According to data from Nansen.ai, Huobi’s stablecoin exchange balances have dropped by 33% in the last week, with traders withdrawing $49 million. Earlier, Colin Wu of Wu Blockchain had posted that “a large number of senior executives of offshore cryptocurrency exchanges … have been detained and investigated by the Chinese police” without adding specifics.  Curve Finance has recouped 73% of the funds stolen during a hack, which saw the platform lose over $73 million worth of various tokens. Over the past week, all $22 million in ether and ether derivatives stolen from Alchemix were returned. Curve, which lets users cheaply swap stablecoins on its platform, was hit by a reentrancy attack that allowed attackers to steal tokens from Curve, and lending and borrowing platforms Metronome and Alchemix.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows monthly changes in the turnover on Deribit, the world's largest crypto options exchange, by trading volume and open interest.  As the volatility meltdown continued, the cumulative turnover in crypto options, perpetual futures and standard futures segments declined by 27% to $37 billion in July.  Still, the exchange accounted for 88% of the global crypto options activity.  - Omkar Godbole  Trending Posts  Coinbase Moves to Dismiss SEC Lawsuit, Alleging Crypto Falls Out of Regulator's Oversight  DeFi Definitely Isn't Dead  Worldcoin's Nairobi Warehouse Raided by Kenyan Police: Local Reports",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,"Lyllah Ledesma, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/07/first-mover-americas-michael-saylors-wager-on-bitcoin-looking-better,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bdba2dc3b7207c676a213a6f0321e58314512da9-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42392763,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgB13r,1691410666,"Fed's Rate Hike Cycle Has Peaked, Investment Banks Say","Federal Reserve policy is now sufficiently restrictive to put inflation back on track to the central bank's 2% target and doesn't warrant additional rate hikes, according to several investment banks.  The end of the tightening cycle doesn't imply a quick return to zero interest rate policy, meaning the heady crypto bull market days of 2021-21 may remain elusive for some time.  The Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hike cycle, which kicked off in March of last year and was partly responsible for roiling the crypto market, has ended, according to several investment banks.  The Fed in July raised its benchmark fed-funds rate by 25 basis points to the 5.25%-5.5% range — bringing cumulative tightening since March 2022 to 525 basis points, or 5.25 percentage points. The bank retained a data-dependent stance, indirectly leaving the door open for further tightening in the coming months.  ING Chief International Economist James Knightley, however, doesn't expect the Fed to walk the talk.  ""On balance, this [Friday's U.S. jobs payrolls] report doesn't suggest any need for the renewed impetus for the Fed hiking interest rates again in September. The Fed has signaled a desire to tighten policy more slowly and the report appears consistent with the gradual cooling of the labor market,"" Knightley, said in a note sent to clients after the report.  Knightley added that a couple more 0.2% month-on-month Consumer Price Index numbers will ""dampen the talk of a rate hike in September."" July's CPI data, which is due later this week, is likely to show the inflation rate held steady at 0.2% month-on-month in July, and August inflation numbers will also be available prior to the Fed's upcoming rate-setting meeting next month.  Markets doing the Fed's job  Financial conditions have tightened of late thanks in part to the U.S. Dollar Index's 2.6% rise over the past three weeks. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield has risen 40 basis points rto 4.10%. That, Knightley argues, should allow the Fed to hold steady.  ""The move higher in Treasury yields and the dollar in the wake of the Fitch downgrade and the U.S. Treasury funding announcement only adds to our conviction that the Fed won’t need to hike interest rates further. These market moves in combination with higher volatility are tightening monetary conditions and will also put up mortgage rates and corporate borrowing costs,"" Knightley said, referring to Fitch Ratings' downgrade of the U.S. government's credit rating last week and to the Treasury increasing the size of its quarterly bond sales.  Banks tighten credit  The Federal Reserve Senior Loan Officer Opinion survey released last week showed that 50% of banks tightened credit standards for commercial and industrial loans in the second quarter, up from 46% in the prior survey. It also said 40% of banks would likely tighten lending standards further.  ""The fact that banks anticipate tightening lending standards further in the second half of the year increases the likelihood of an additional drag on economic growth. This is something to be mindful of as the economy navigates the coming quarters,"" Wells Fargo's economic research team said in a note to clients on Friday.  Policy sufficiently restrictive  With the July rate hike to the 5.25%-5.5% range, the real or inflation-adjusted benchmark interest rate has climbed to over 2%, the highest since 2007, according to data tracked by Piper Sandler.  That weakens the case for continued rate hikes. Positive real interest rates are a widely accepted measure of a restrictive policy or measures that put inflation back on track to the Fed's target of 2%.  ""Our base case is that this was the Fed's final rate hike for this tightening cycle, as the real fed-funds rate has climbed to its highest level since 2007 (right chart below), suggesting economic conditions have turned notably restrictive,"" Piper Sandler's research note dated July 28 said.  Return of animal spirits?  A potential end of the tightening cycle doesn't necessarily mean a quick pivot to liquidity-boosting rate cuts and a return to the 2020-21 like bull market.  Back then, most central banks, including the Fed, were pumping record amounts of money into the system through zero interest rate policy and unlimited bond buying to help the global economy absorb the shock from the coronavirus pandemic. They are unlikely to revert to the ultra-easy policy in the near term. Recently, the Bank of Japan, the last heavyweight running a loose monetary policy, has begun turning hawkish.  ""We see central banks being forced to keep policy tight to lean against inflationary pressures. This is not a friendly backdrop for broad asset class returns, marking a break from the four decades of steady growth and inflation known as the Great Moderation,"" BlackRock said in a weekly market note on July 31.",NEUTRAL,없음,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/07/feds-rate-hike-cycle-has-peaked-investment-banks-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a46469b6b6be19228f71e4d42851e68326269bcb-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The huge bounty offer is open to every person who can pinpoint the individual behind the incident in such a way that would lead to definitive legal repercussions. Curve Finance Extends Bounty Offer to the Public Curve Finance announced the public offer using an Ethereum transaction’s input data, noting that the allowed time for the voluntary return of the funds connected to the Curve exploit was 08:00 UTC, and that time is now elapsed. Related Reading: Crypto Funds Vs Bitcoin Holders: Who Was The Better Performer In H1 2023 Curve and other protocols that were affected by the attack had previously offered a 10% bug bounty to the hacker on August 3. Upon agreeing to the offer, the hacker returned part of the stolen assets to JPEGd and Alchemix but did not refund other affected pools. Since the time allowed has elapsed, Curve announced that any person capable of identifying the hacker would receive assets worth $1.85 million. This recent announcement was extended in scope to include members of the general public. According to Curve, while the deadline for the voluntary return of stolen funds had passed, should the hacker elect to return the stolen funds, the platform “…will not pursue this further.” While returning the parts of the funds earlier, the hacker left a message that was seemingly targeted at Curve and Alchemix teams, noting their intention to return the funds. However, the hacker stated that the decision to return such funds was not based on fear of being recognized but rather out of a desire not to “ruin” the projects associated with the exploit. CRV price stalls at $0.61 following exploit | Source: CRVUSD on Tradingview.com The $61 Million Reentrancy Attack Members of the Curve Finance community were left shocked after a hacker utilized vulnerable versions of the Vyper programming language to implement reentrancy attacks on stable pools within Curve Finance on the 31st of July. The attack drained Curve Finance of over $61 million, including $13.6 million from Alchemix’s aIETH-ETH, $11.4 million from JPEGd’s pETH-ETH, and $1.6 million from Metronome’s sETH-ETH. The event raised concerns about the likely fallout in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, especially with respect to the risks posed to every pool using Wrapped Ether (WETH).

15742510,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=546015,1691406352,When Will Polygon (MATIC) Rebound? Analyzing This Month’s Recovery Potential,"Polygon (MATIC), a prominent player in the cryptocurrency market, faced a volatile journey in July, as it initially cleared significant gains but encountered setbacks that have left investors and enthusiasts eager for signs of a resurgence. As of the latest data from CoinGecko, the MATIC price stood at $0.66, reflecting a 24-hour slump of 0.4% and a seven-day decline of 4.7%. While the token’s price performance has been fluctuating, technical indicators suggest the potential for a rebound. Related Reading: PEPE’s Future: Will Prices Of Meme Coins Continue To Drop? Source: Coingecko Polygon: Testing Retracement Levels A crucial tool in analyzing MATIC’s price movement has been the Fibonacci retracement tool, which evaluates the retracement levels between the June low and July high. The 50% Fibonacci level, situated at $0.70, failed to uphold the pullback, raising concerns about the sustainability of the gains. The recent activity has seen the token testing the 38.2% Fibonacci level at $0.655, which has been retested twice, demonstrating its significance as a support level. Presently, MATIC has bounced off the 38.2% Fibonacci level, indicating potential for recovery. However, the overall market structure on higher timeframes remains bearish, and the interplay with Bitcoin’s performance can play a pivotal role. As Bitcoin exhibited weakness, a price rejection at the 50% Fibonacci level is a feasible scenario. MATIC market cap at $6.2 billion on the daily chart: TradingView.com The key intrigue lies below the 38.2% Fibonacci level, where bullish order blocks on both daily and weekly charts are positioned. These blocks, particularly the daily one which has already shown its impact, could mitigate further price decline should the 38.2% Fibonacci support give way. Both the 38.2% and 23.6% Fibonacci levels are emerging as critical interest points for bullish traders. Complex On-Chain Dynamics And Amazon’s Role While the Network Profit and Loss (NPL) data seems to suggest that MATIC might have reached a price bottom, a closer analysis of its on-chain performance raises concerns about a potential additional drop in value. This intricacy mirrors the broader struggles of the crypto market, which has been grappling with various regulatory, environmental, and adoption challenges. Amidst this backdrop, MATIC’s future remains uncertain.

Immaculate Kassait, commissioner of Kenya's Office of the Data Protection, said Tools for Humanity, the parent company of Worldcoin, failed to disclose its true intentions when it registered in Kenya, according to media reports. Police took Worldcoin data to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations headquarters for analysis, the reports said.  Worldcoin was co-founded by Sam Altman, the tech entrepreneur who is CEO of OpenAI, the company behind popular artificial-intelligence tool ChatGPT. Worldcoin aims to promulgate a new way to verify that a user is human and unique on the internet using iris scans, artificial intelligence and zero-knowledge proofs. Verified users can receive grants of the Worldcoin token. Developers can build applications on top of this identification protocol and include a wallet where the Worldcoin token is distributed.  After the project's launch in July, users could receive airdrops of the Worldcoin token in exchange for being scanned. It is now facing trouble in Kenya.  ""The officers backed by multi-agency officials went to the offices along Mombasa Road armed with a search warrant and broke in Saturday before leaving with machines they believe stores data gathered by the firm,"" media outlet Kahawatungu reported.  The raid was reportedly conducted under Kussait's supervision. A representative of the Office of Data Protection Commissioner, or ODPC, told CoinDesk he was unaware of any such operation.  Last week, the Ministry of the Interior suspended the project’s operations in the country, even as Kenya's minister for the digital economy, Eliud Owalo, said the ODPC had been in contact with Worldcoin as far back as April and had concluded that its activities comply with Kenya's data-protection laws. Later in the week, however, the ODPC issued a statement saying that after a preliminary review, it found ""a number of legitimate regulatory concerns"" around the project. Authorities in the U.K., France and Germany are also looking into the project.  Worldcoin didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

42410036,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcRwIn,1691403519,"Cardano Blockchain Transactions Jumped 49% in Q2 on Network Upgrades, New Users","Cardano transactions rose as several upgrades went live earlier this year, attracting both users and developers to the network.  Such metrics usually precede an increase in token prices as they indicate growing demand and usage.  Cardano blockchain activity in the second quarter grew in both value locked and transactional metrics from the first quarter amid technical improvements and a rise in developer interest, a report by analytics firm Messari shows.  While decentralized exchange Minswap showed the largest absolute growth, several new decentralized applications, or dapps, also contributed to the increase, Messari said.  The report, which was commissioned by Cardano developer Input Output, compared second-quarter developments against first-quarter figures. It noted that while transaction activity grew, the number of active daily users decreased 4% — the fourth drop in address activity in the past five quarters.  “The ratio of transactions to active addresses has been growing steadily over the past five quarters, suggesting that the average user is more active now than they previously were,” the report said. “In Q2, the Transaction / Active Address ratio of 1.19 was up 6.1% QoQ and 13.2% YoY.”  Blockchain load — a measure of how much data is contained in blocks over a certain period — rose to 50% from under 40% in the previous three months. It peaked at 81% in May.  DefiLlama data shows that $175 million worth of tokens are locked on Cardano as of Monday, the highest level for this year, but still about 50% below a lifetime peak of $340 million hit in May 2022.  Such activity comes on the back of key Cardano upgrades since the start of this year.  A change to reduce ""epoch"" transitions and make the blockchain smoother for network users took effect in June. Epochs refer to the time periods on Cardano, with epoch lasting 432,000 slots and each slot being one second.  ADA tokens are staked during these epochs during which new blocks on the Cardano network are produced, potentially increasing demand for the tokens as block rewards become more lucrative, based on activity.  In March, a feature on Milkomeda, a network that connects blockchains to the Ethereum Virtual Machine, or EVM, began to allow Cardano blockchain users to gain access to EVM smart contracts with any cardano (ADA) wallet, expanding the ecosystem's usefulness.  An Ethereum Virtual Machine is where all Ethereum accounts and smart contracts live, serving as a virtual computer used by developers to create dapps.  The new feature will allow Ethereum application developers to build on Cardano’s network using Solidity — the computer language used to code Ethereum — without needing to install new toolkits or learn a new computer language.  Such applications can then be used solely with Cardano tokens instead of ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum network, increasing the tokens' utility for holders.",POSITIVE,ADA | ETH,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/07/cardano-blockchain-transactions-jumped-49-last-quarter-as-ada-sentiment-grew,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bce1c7ed442ff020907048f3be45f5d93bba5bd3-3499x1968.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

15740772,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545977,1691402452,Behind The Quiet: Low Bitcoin Volatility Masks Underlying Market Dynamics,"In the world of Bitcoin, silence is not always golden. The recent weeks have seen Bitcoin’s price volatility drop to historical lows, with the BTC price trading mostly between $29,000 and $30,000. However, beneath this placid surface, a number of intriguing market dynamics are at play. “Realized volatility for Bitcoin has collapsed to historical lows. Across 1-month to 1yr timeframes, this is the quietest we have seen the corn since after March 2020. Historically, such low volatility aligns with the post-bear-market hangover periods (re-accumulation phase),” stated Checkmate, lead on-chain analyst at Glassnode. The chart shared by Checkmate shows that annualized realized volatility resembles the post-bear era for Bitcoin from March 2020 when volatility was at 47%. Currently, 1-year volatility sits at 49.1%, 3-month volatility at 35.5%, and 1-month volatility at 22.9%. Quit Before The Storm For Bitcoin However, the low volatility is not the only story. Checkmate also highlighted a new all-time high for Bitcoin’s long-term holder supply, now at 14.59M BTC, which accounts for 75% of the circulating supply. This shows that an increasingly high number of Bitcoin investors are convinced of a future rally, leading to a supply shortage, while high risk traders are washed out of the market due to lacking volatility. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Points To Bitcoin Price History Repeating Itself – Are The Signs Bullish? Simultaneously, there’s a surge in institutional positioning; volume and open interest of the CME Bitcoin futures have reached a 20-month high in July. Despite the Bitcoin spot markets recording low volumes, the CME futures saw the highest volume since January 2022, with $55.8 billion in July. The CTFC data reveals a fascinating slugfest between two investor groups. Asset managers are $1.2 billion net long, while hedge funds are net short by -$980 million. This standoff suggests an imminent breakout in Bitcoin’s price, potentially leaving one of these groups with burnt fingers. On-chain analyst Ali Martinez provided further insight: “Even as Bitcoin dropped from $32,000 to $29,000, the number of new BTC addresses steadily rose! This bullish divergence between price and network growth hints at a stable long-term BTC uptrend. Buy the dip!” Indeed, the current low volatility phase is not without precedent or predictive power. Renowned analyst @CryptoCon provides a compelling perspective on this, stating that such periods of sideways price action are not only normal but potentially bullish. “Bitcoin sideways price action at this point in the cycle is completely normal! The 2 Week Mass Index crosses into the golden pocket at the most stagnant cycle points, just before massive bullish moves. Data everywhere points to the same conclusion: Low volatility is bullish,” CryptoCon tweeted. Chris Burniske, partner at Placeholder VC, also shared his perspective on the current market dynamics. “Currently, tourists are inactive while residents are accumulating swiftly, owning 74.8% of all supply. That’s consistent with an early-stage bull market. Thirty percent of BTC has left for cold storage since 2020, leaving exchanges with 2.26 million. Bitcoin seems fairly valued relative to the number of active entities on the network.” Related Reading: Tether May Now Be 11th Largest Bitcoin Holder, Analyst Says Burniske’s simplified price/cycle model projects Bitcoin to reach near $39,000 by the fourth quarter of 2023 and $92,000 (base scenario) by Q4 2025 with entities above 600,000. In conclusion, the current low volatility phase of Bitcoin may seem uneventful on the surface, but the underlying market dynamics suggest a different story. The tug-of-war between asset managers and hedge funds, the steady rise in new BTC addresses, and the swift accumulation by long-term holders all hint at a brewing storm. At press time, the Bitcoin price was at $29,076.

Therefore, it comes as little surprise that India is using its time as president of the G20 nations to try to implement coordinated regulations that will get tough on digital assets. As India uses its influence to suppress cryptocurrencies, ably assisted by global financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) among others, it often resorts to claims that it is doing so in order to ensure monetary stability, and it continually refers back to the FTX collapse as a reason for doing so.

Today there is a unique opportunity to purchase shares at a discount to GBTC's underlying BTC, with potential for the shares to revert back to some degree of a premium. The drop from the ~38% peak premium in December 2020 to the -48% discount in December 2022 is a similar move to that seen in the 2017/2018 cycle, with GBTC peaking at a premium of above 100% in 2017, and then declining to a premium of just ~7% at the end of 2018. We can take advantage of these movements in premiums and discounts to NAV to allow us to outperform BTC and the broader market. Buying when GBTC hit its lowest premium to NAV of 7% in 2018 and selling in Dec 2020 when the premium reached 38% would have allowed you to outperform BTC by roughly 25%. The breakdown of that 25% would be a 2900 basis point outperformance against BTC from an increase in premium, minus roughly 400 basis points for 2 years of management fees from the Trust. Purchasing GBTC is even more compelling this cycle, because I can justify it as a value investor looking at the net asset value of the Trust. In 2018, the GBTC premium/discount bottomed out at a premium of 7%, while we are now sitting at a discount to NAV. Cycle Peak Premium Largest Discount Decline in Premium Trough to Next Cycle's Peak Change in Discount/Premium 2017/2018 +100% premium in 2017 +7% premium in 2018 9300 basis points 3100 basis point gain from increase in premium 2021/2022 +38% premium Dec 2020 -48% discount Dec 2022 8600 basis points TBD We will see where the peak premium lands this cycle. I would likely sell my Grayscale Trusts when their discounts narrows to zero and rotate into other holdings, but I am pointing out that there is additional upside in the form of a potential future GBTC premium. Catalyst #1: Undeniable Pattern of 4 Year Cycles, with 3 Years Up Followed by 1 Year Down The four-year cycle theory revolving around the halving is becoming abundantly clear. Since 2011, Bitcoin has had a clear history of 4 year cycles with 3 years up, followed by 1 year down. This has happened 3 times in Bitcoin's history, with 2011-2014, 2015-2018, and 2019-2023 (assuming BTC ends the year above $16.6K). See historical BTC calendar year returns below. Bitcoin Returns by Calendar Year Year Return 2011 1467% 2012 187% 2013 5870% 2014 -61% 2015 35% 2016 124% 2017 1338% 2018 -73% 2019 94% 2020 302% 2021 60% 2022 -64% 2023 YTD 75% According to legendary investor Sir John Templeton, ""The four most dangerous words in investing are, it's different this time."" Pattern recognition is a key to success in investing and success in life. The clear pattern in the historical data is undeniable, and the burden of proof is on the bears to explain why it's different this time. Catalyst #2: Potential Approval of BTC ETF GBTC has been responding well to the news of the recent various BTC ETF applications from BlackRock, WisdomTree, Fidelity, Invesco, Valkyrie Investments, Ark Invest, and VanEck. Blackrock filed its BTC ETF application on June 15 , when the GBTC discount was at -42%. The discount has since narrowed to -27.5%, with much of that move being in the 2 weeks following the BlackRock filing. GBTC does have an outstanding lawsuit against the SEC in an effort to convert the Trust into an ETF, which would immediately close the discount to NAV to zero due to the option to redeem shares at NAV. If one of the BTC ETF applications gets approved, then GBTC should immediately spike on the news as the market reprices the probability of a success for GBTC in their effort to convert into an ETF. I would note that this event would push returns forward in time, but would also limit the total upside potential by eliminating the possibility of a premium on GBTC, as ETFs almost never deviate far from NAV. ""Not Your Keys, Not Your Crypto"" is not the safest philosophy, contrary to popular opinion The crypto community has a well-intentioned philosophy of self-custody over your assets. They advise not to hold your crypto-assets on exchanges, which has saved countless people from disasters like FTX, Voyager, and Celsius Network. They then extend this sentiment to Grayscale, saying that issues with the broader Grayscale company could lead to the loss of assets in the Grayscale Trusts such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. GBTC is registered with the SEC, and has to file public audited quarterly reports. Any transfer between the Trust and Grayscale's management company in excess of the regular 2% per year management fees would be picked up by the end of the quarter, and would immediately warrant SEC scrutiny. This would also have to be approved by Coinbase Custody, the custodians of the underlying Bitcoin. Coinbase is publicly traded and monitored by the SEC, so there are two levels of security against fraudulent and illegal transfers. While Coinbase is a centralized exchange, and regular customers would likely end up as unsecured creditors in the event of a Coinbase bankruptcy, this is not the case for Coinbase Custody clients such as GBTC. Digital assets held by Coinbase Custody are legally owned by, and held in trust for, clients. In the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of Coinbase Custody, such assets do not become property of the estate, and creditors will have no rights to such assets. - Coinbase Custody These levels of security make owning BTC through GBTC, in my view, safer than owning BTC through self-custody. There are countless stories of people losing their hard wallets or forgetting passwords/seed phrases. Think about the number of times you forgot an important password because it was different from all the other passwords you use. Now think about the chance of you remembering a randomly generated 24 word seed phrase 7 years from now. There's a reason we use banks instead of carrying our cash around. We trust the banks more than we trust ourselves with our money's safety. A Final Word GBTC offers a unique opportunity for a value investor to purchase BTC at a discount to NAV. While I expect GBTC to significantly outperform the market, I do not currently own GBTC as I own other similar crypto trusts that are trading at larger discounts to NAV. I will write about these Trusts in future articles. I have also recently moved to Puerto Rico to take advantage of its 0% capital gains tax rate on equities and cryptocurrencies as a part of the Act 60 program. I would advise crypto investors expecting significant gains in the projected 2024 and 2025 bull market to speak with tax professionals to see if the program makes sense for you.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4624848-gbtc-value-investing-meets-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/15740155.jpeg

This metric has now indicated a glimmer of a price floor for the frog-themed token that has been facing its fair share of challenges. As a result, a ray of positivity has dawned upon numerous investors who have been expecting a much-needed rebound, following a prolonged period of decline within the meme coins arena. However, a more meticulous analysis of the situation unveils a contrasting reality, suggesting that the token’s woes might be far from over. At first glance, the dip in PEPE’s NPL metric appeared to be an encouraging sign. Historically, a significant drop in this metric has often coincided with a price bottom in many cryptocurrencies.

Nevertheless, deeper scrutiny of on-chain data reveals a less optimistic picture. While the NPL suggested a potential price floor, the broader on-chain performance of PEPE contradicts this notion.

Source: Coingecko Holders have continued to offload their tokens including meme coins, thwarting the possibility of a substantial price rebound. The 9.1% seven-day slump underscores the persistent challenges PEPE faces, casting doubt on the immediate potential for recovery. Insights From The Broader Crypto Market Struggle PEPE’s struggle is not occurring in isolation. The wider cryptocurrency market has been grappling with a plethora of challenges, including regulatory uncertainties, market sentiment shifts, and macroeconomic factors. The volatility that has become synonymous with the crypto landscape has impacted tokens across the spectrum, including well-established ones. This backdrop of uncertainty has resulted in heightened caution among investors. The fear of further price drops, according to a recent PEPE price analysis, prompts them to liquidate their holdings preemptively, even when metrics like NPL seem favorable. This collective behavior contributes to the sustained selling pressure observed in tokens like PEPE, despite signs that might hint at a price recovery. The market cap of cryptocurrencies reached $1.12 trillion today. Chart: TradingView.com PEPE And Meme Coins: The Road Ahead While the dip in PEPE’s NPL initially raised hopes of a price bottom, a meticulous analysis uncovers the underlying challenges that continue to suppress the token’s recovery. The on-chain data reflects a consistent trend of token holders selling, which overshadows the potential for an immediate price rebound. Moreover, the broader struggles of the crypto market further exacerbate the situation, making it crucial for investors to manage their expectations.

If the bid is approved, the deal could see an injection of around $30 million worth of FLEX tokens into Hodlnaut. A White Knight Investor For Hodlnaut? According to a report in Bloomberg, the OPNX exchange has made an offer to acquire 75% of the struggling crypto lender. The bid comes at a critical time for Hodlnaut, which is undergoing a restructuring plan under the supervision of a Singapore court. The deal would see a significant capital injection into Hodlnaut and would partially cover outstanding claims and creditor payouts. If the deal is approved, creditors will receive 30% of their claims in FLEX tokens and other cryptocurrencies. This offer also gives them a direct stake in the future potential of the entity being acquired. Alternatively, creditors also have the choice of opting for a pro-rata payment, allowing them to recover about 95% of the available corporate asset pool. According to OPNX, this option prioritizes the immediate financial recovery and stability of creditors. However, the bid is subject to approval from Hodlnaut’s creditors, who effectively hold the fate of the acquisition in their hands. The creditors’ decisions could also have a significant impact on the larger crypto-lending ecosystem. Unclear If Deal Goes Through So far, it remains to be seen if Hodlnaut’s creditors will accept the deal. Back in April, a significant majority of the struggling crypto lender’s creditors indicated their desire to liquidate the company. In a letter from the interim judicial manager (IJM), users representing 55.38% of creditors having claims of around 228.3 million Singaporean dollars ($170 million) have indicated that they prefer liquidation rather than restructuring. However, at the time, there was no source of fresh capital for the company. “There appears to be no indication of a white knight investor to date, and hence no prospect of any fresh capital injection.” Meanwhile, only users with around 2.42% of claims supported looking into the restructuring option. However, all of these claims belonged to company directors. A mediation proposal was also opposed by the major creditors of the company, including Samtrade Custodian and SAM Fintech, and the Algorand Foundation. Algorand has a $35 million exposure to Hodlnaut. The Hodlnaut Fiasco Hodlnaut halted all withdrawals in August 2022, as the turmoil in the crypto markets led to a significant liquidity crisis for the crypto lender. Eventually, the company entered into judicial management, temporarily protecting it against legal action. Following this, the company entered into a court-based restructuring process, shedding light on the extent of its financial difficulties. The company had stated at the time, “We are aiming to avoid a forced liquidation of our assets as it will require us to sell our users’ cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, and WBTC at these current depressed asset prices.” With Hodlnaut struggling with the complexities of financial rehabilitation and creditor interests, founders Zhu Juntao and Simon Lee proposed selling the business as an alternative to liquidation, arguing it would result in a more favorable outcome for creditors.

The new hires include Esteban Gil, formerly of Garena Free Fire, and Brent Pease, who previously held a senior role at Electronic Arts, the legendary company behind the FIFA football franchise. WAGMI said it was delighted to be able to announce the new hires, who bring a wealth of expertise from established games developers to help transform the industry with the unique advantages of Web3. If you haven't heard of WAGMI, it’s essentially a video games studio that’s focused on Web3 gaming. In Web3 video games, players are uniquely able to own in-game assets such as characters, weapons and skins, which are represented by non-fungible tokens that can be bought and sold at will. Web3 gaming also provides unique incentives for players with in-game rewards such as WAGMI tokens which can be earned for completing daily challenges and beating other players in head-to-head matches. WAGMI’s flagship title is WAGMI Defense, a sci-fi themed tower defense game in the mould of Plants vs. Zombies or Kingdom Rush Vengeance. Players are required to strategically place their troops and set their traps in order to defend their tower from the enemy onslaught. They need to stand up to the assault for three minutes per match, and with each round they win they’ll earn an in-game resource called NiFe that can be used to buy other items or traded for cryptocurrency. Gil, who previously led Garena Free Fire and served as Lean Portfolio Management at Respawn and Apex Legends, is being hired to assume a similar role at WAGMI. In particular, he’ll be tasked with overseeing the company’s business strategy development, focused on driving demand for consumer-oriented products. In a statement, Gil said he’s excited to apply his skills and experience to Web3, and stated his belief that technologies such as NFTs can revolutionize the gaming industry. “By leveraging these cutting-edge technologies, we can deliver even more engaging and immersive gaming experiences to our fans around the world,” he added. As for Pease, he joins the company from EA, where he most recently served as its Director of Operations. As a highly experienced industry executive, he will assume a combined COO/GM role at WAGMIU, where he’ll be tasked with overseeing the company’s day-to-day operations and focus on the implementation of key growth strategies. Pease is said to be a widely respected figure in the video gaming industry, having previously founded Industrial Toys, which was later acquired by EA. “'I am honored to have been asked to bring my 30 years of experience in building games and companies to this incredible team of passionate creators,” Pease said. “This is the most exciting vision for players I have seen and I look forward to making amazing games at WAGMI that thrill our ever-growing community.” There is certainly lots of room for WAGMI to grow. At present, Web3 games attract barely 3% of the estimated three billion video games players in the world. Yet WAGMI says the advantages of Web3 gaming are so compelling that if it’s able to lower the barrier to entry by easing onboarding friction, this number will surely grow. Of course, is Web3 gaming is to really catch on, the industry will need to develop truly engaging games that can capture the imagination of millions of gamers, just as legendary titles from the Web2 gaming world, such as GTA and Fortnite, have done. This explains WAGMI’s decision to go after talent with experience in the traditional video game industry. “To have AAA Talent like Brent and Esteban join our team is a real testament to what we are building,” said WAGMI’s chief executive Ian Bentley. “They see clearly not only our vision as a franchise, but also this once in a lifetime opportunity to be a part of history in evolving the gaming space.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42410030,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcRvve,1691396887,Crypto Options Traders Bet Against Volatility,"Bitcoin's (BTC) key volatility metrics are hovering at multiyear lows, suggesting the potential for a move higher back toward the mean.  Some traders, however, are saying the initial optimism around the set of applications for spot exchange-traded funds has faded and options look pricier.  Shorting volatility through options is a risky strategy and requires active management of the position.  There is a lot of market chatter about an impending volatility explosion in bitcoin. Still, some crypto traders retain a bias for shorting volatility — that is setting up strategies that bet against price turbulence.  Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has primarily traded in the range of $29,000 to $30,000 since July 24. That's below the $30,000-$32,000 range of the preceding four weeks. The cryptocurrency's price hasn't risen more than 4% in a single day since June 21.  As such, key metrics gauging bitcoin's backward-looking realized volatility and estimated or implied volatility have tanked to multiyear lows.  Because volatility is said to be mean-reverting, and because increased volatility boosts options prices, some market participants are anticipating sudden and notable price turbulence and are considering buying BTC call or put options, which offer protection against bullish or bearish moves, to profit from the change. That's known as the ""long volatility trade.""  Others, including Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, suggest considering a short trade.  ""Upside volatility likely remains far away unless BTC can take new year-to-date highs. The clearest catalyst for this currently revolves around a BTC spot ETF,"" Magadini said in his latest market note. ""I continue to believe the 'base case' in this environment is to lean towards the short-vol bias, (in the near term).""  Traders typically short volatility by selling or writing call or put options. The strategy is preferred when realized and implied volatility metrics appear rich relative to their historical standards or lifetime average, there is a lack of catalysts for price moves, and implied volatility is greater than realized volatility.  Currently, realized volatility, or RV, and implied volatility, or IV, are hovering at multiyear lows, which doesn't favor selling options or shorting volatility. However, the other two factors do.  The initial optimism from the string of U.S. spot-ETF filings by the likes of BlackRock, Invesco and others in mid-June has faded, and the Securities and Exchange Commission's final decision on the matter is months away. Bitcoin's 30-day options-based implied volatility stood at an annualized 29.5% at press time with the realized volatility was 25%, according to Amberdata. The seven-day IV also traded at a premium to the equivalent realized volatility. Those readings indicate near-term options aren't necessarily cheap.  ""There's a lot of cost (carry) for long volatility players assuming nothing happens until an ETF decision. Realized continues to be dismal, as the spot is trading in tight daily ranges,"" Magadini wrote. ""The fundamental catalyst for volatility, the ETF, is ways away.""  Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader from the crypto asset-management firm Blofin, expressed a similar view, saying that selling volatility is one of the few profitable trading strategies.  ""The implied price-moving range of the current 7-day average IV is about 4% for BTC. Still, the realized daily price moving range is less than 1%, or even less than 0.5%, which means that selling volatility will have relatively good returns, although the current IVs are also at historically low levels,"" Ardern told CoinDesk. ""Given the absence of big news in August, selling volatility and taking a vacation for solid theta gains is the only thing I can do right now.""  Theta gains equal to selling time for a short options seller. As time passes and expiration nears, the option becomes cheaper, yielding a profit for the option seller.  Hedging risks  Shorting volatility or selling options is a risky business, which can result in huge losses if the market moves suddenly. It requires an ample supply of capital and expertise.  One way to mitigate the risk involved is to purchase out-of-the-money options if and when the market moves, Magadini said.  Calls at strike prices above the underlying security's going market rate and puts below the going price are said to be out of the money, and are popularly referred to as wings or tails.  ""A move above $32,000 could bring both a bullish spot trend and an explosion in volatility with it. Buying long-term out-of-the-money call 'tails' is an interesting way to hedge a short-vol (near/medium term maturity) play,"" Magadini said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/07/crypto-options-traders-are-still-shorting-bitcoin-volatility,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ef0d9a24f8a3c42eb50167607c519fb8f11344c0-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Cochran bases his assertions on a detailed examination of Huobi's balance sheets and the recent activities of Justin Sun, the founder of Tron. Despite these allegations, Huobi maintains that all operations are proceeding as normal. According to Cochran's investigation, Huobi's own ""Merkle Tree Audit"" indicates a significant discrepancy in the exchange's held assets. He points out that while the audit lists that Huobi users hold $631 million worth of Tether (USDT), Huobi's actual holdings amount to only $90 million. This significant gap, Cochran alleges, is indicative of insolvency. Cochran further argues that Sun has been treating the exchange like a personal piggy bank, transferring funds to his decentralized finance (DeFi) projects and thus leaving the exchange unable to meet its obligations. Specifically, he alleges that Sun is inflating the yield on his DeFi apps to entice more deposits into Huobi. Adding to the concerns, Cochran noted a substantial sell-off of Tether (USDT) on Binance, which he believes is connected to the solvency fears surrounding Huobi. He also raised questions about Sun's recently launched ""stUSDT"", a variant of USDT that Sun claims is backed by government bonds. Cochran alleges that the stUSDT does not have sufficient backing, which further compounds the potential risk. Cochran also pointed out that certain Huobi and Tron executives are reportedly under investigation by Chinese authorities, a development that has fanned the flames of these allegations. These apprehended individuals reportedly include key personnel from both organizations, adding more credibrility to the concerns about Huobi's financial stability. Huobi has denied any wrongdoing and maintains that all operations are running normally. However, Cochran dismissed these assertions, stating that his source, a senior executive at Tron, confirmed that team members are indeed under investigation due to actions related to Huobi. Cochran's analysis, if accurate, paints a worrying picture for Huobi's financial health, adding fuel to rumors of the company's potential insolvency.

Curve Finance had fallen victim to a major heist on the 31st of July, leading to the hacker draining around $61 million from the protocol. Alchemix Announces Return Of All Funds The Curve Finance exploit had resulted in Alchemix losing around $13.6 million from its alETH-ETH pool. Apart from Alchemix, several other pools also saw their funds drained. These included JPEGd’s pETH-ETH pool, which saw outflows of around $11.4 million, and Metronome’s sETH-ETH pool, which saw the exploit drain about $1.6 million. The hacker had targeted several stable pools on Curve Finance using a reentrancy bug that impacted the Vyper programming language used on Curve Finance. Now, Alchemix has announced on X that the hacker has returned the stolen funds after accepting a bug bounty offer from Curve, Metronome, and Alchemix. “We are extremely happy to announce that all funds stolen by the hacker of the Alchemix @CurveFinance pool have now been returned.” An Offer The Hacker Couldn’t Refuse Alchemix, Metronome, and Curve Finance had offered the hacker a 10% bug bounty as a reward, asking them to return the remaining 90% of the stolen funds. The three entities had stated that if the hacker returned the funds, they would not face any further legal or law enforcement actions. “The offer comes with a guarantee of no further legal actions or involvement of law enforcement. We want to resolve this in a civilized manner. You will have no risk of us pursuing this further, no risk of law enforcement issues.” However, the three protocols also told the hacker to view their offer as a final warning, giving them until the 6th of August to accept their offer. They warned that if the hacker refused or ignored their warning, they would be expanding the bounty to the public, offering 10% of the funds to anyone who would help identify the hacker in a way that would lead to conviction in court. The stark warning stated that the hacker would feel the full force of the law should he fail to comply. “If you choose not to partake in the voluntary return and complete the process by the 6th of August at 0800 UTC, we will expand the bounty to the public and offer the full 10% to the person who is able to identify you in a way that leads to your conviction in the courts. We will pursue you from all angles with the full extent of the law.” Hacker Accepts Offer And Returns Funds On the 4th of August, the hacker posted a message on the Ethereum network directed at Curve Finance and Alchemix development teams. In the not-so-pleasant message, the hacker stated that they would return the funds, but because they did not want to ruin the multiple projects impacted, and not because they were caught or because of the threat of legal action. The hacker stated in his on-chain message, “I’m refunding, not because you can find me. It’s because I don’t want to ruin your project.” At around 11:16 am UTC, the hacker returned 1 alETH to the Curve Finance deployer account. Following the success of the initial transaction, the hacker made three separate transfers two hours later, totaling around 4820.55 alETH, sent to the Alchemix development team’s multisig wallet. The funds returned were around $8.9 million worth of crypto assets, making up around 15% of the stolen funds. Alchemix later reported that the hacker returned all of the stolen funds. NFT protocol JPEG’d, in a separate announcement, also confirmed that they had been refunded, with the perpetrators returning around 5495 ETH.

The relatively swift recovery has bolstered sentiment for CRV tokens, which have pared most of the losses from a 30% drop following the attack.  Curve Finance has recouped 73% of funds stolen during a hack that saw the lending platform lose over $73 million worth of tokens, causing contagion effects across the broader ecosystem.  Over the past week, all $22 million in ether (ETH) and ether derivatives stolen from lending protocol Alchemix were returned. A trading bot returned 90% in ether stolen from lending platform JPEG'd; pseudonymous ethical hacker “c0ffeebabe.eth” returned over $6 million taken from decentralized-finance, or DeFi, platform Metronome and a Curve trading pool; and another ethical hacker returned $13 million from Alchemix.  Curve, which lets users cheaply swap stablecoins on its platform, was hit by a reentrancy attack that allowed attackers to steal tokens from Curve, and lending and borrowing platforms Metronome and Alchemix. Those affected protocols have since offered a 10% bounty for returning the assets by Aug. 6, as reported.  Reentrancy is a common bug that allows attackers to trick a smart contract by making repeated calls, or software commands, to a protocol in order to steal assets. The attack was traced to faulty code on Vyper, a programming language used to power parts of the Curve system.  Shortly following the attacks, Curve offered a 10% bounty to attackers for the return of the funds. On Friday, the attacker started to return funds to Alchemix after confirming the deposit address in a blockchain message.  Over $18 million in stolen funds are still remaining, with Curve opening up the bounty to the public on Sunday night.  “The deadline for the voluntary return of funds in the Curve exploit passed at 0800 UTC,” Curve Finance said in a blockchain transaction. “We now extend the bounty to the public, and offer a reward valued at 10% of remaining exploited funds (currently $1.85M) to the person who is able to identify the exploiter in a way that leads to a conviction in the courts.  “If the exploiter chooses to return the funds in full, we will not pursue this further,” the protocol added.  The return of funds has buoyed sentiment for Curve — which is often referred to as one of the most influential platforms in the DeFi ecosystem — and its governance tokens CRV.  CRV lost almost 30% of value, from 72 cents to as low as 50 cents, in the days following the exploit and has since pared losses amid the positive developments, trading at 61 cents on Monday morning.",POSITIVE,CRV | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | CRV | ETH | MINING | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/07/curve-recoups-73-of-hacked-funds-bolstering-crv-sentiment,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ef20a7419df04fdd08d287a1d83597b792bcece2-5148x2896.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

15735852,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/08/binance-releases-august-report-for-proof-of-reserves,1691391600,Binance Releases August Report For Proof of Reserves,"Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, has published its August 2023 reserve report, showcasing a reserve ratio well over 100% for all of its major cryptocurrency holdings. The disclosure forms a part of Binance's ongoing commitment to maintain a Proof of Reserves (PoR) system, providing evidence that it holds sufficient funds to cover all customer deposits. The report is based on an audit for BTC Block Height 801130 from aggregated data updated to August 1st, 2023. Proof of Reserves (PoR) is a transparency protocol that confirms the solvency of a cryptocurrency exchange. It functions as proof that the exchange possesses enough funds to cover users' assets on a 1:1 ratio. Essentially, when a user deposits a Bitcoin, Binance's reserves increase by at least one Bitcoin, thereby ensuring all client funds are fully backed. These figures don't include Binance's corporate holdings, which are kept separate. Binance's PoR report demonstrates that the exchange's reserves are well above the customer net balance for all the reported cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, Tether, BUSD, and USDC, with reserve rates ranging from 101.62% to 117.99%. This shows that the company has more than enough reserves to meet all potential customer withdrawals. PoR aims to increase transparency, safety, and user protection in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As such, it discourages exchanges from misusing user funds and promotes trust among users. In line with this, Binance users can verify their account's inclusion in the last PoR verification themselves, further emphasizing the exchange's commitment to transparency and user trust. How Proof of Reserves (PoR) Works with Merkle Trees To ensure that it holds all user assets 1:1, Binance has implemented a system that leverages Merkle trees. A Merkle Tree is a cryptographic tool that facilitates the condensation of large volumes of data into a single hash, called a Merkle Root. This root acts as a cryptographic ""seal"" that summarizes all the input data. Furthermore, Merkle Trees allow users to verify specific contents included within a particular set of sealed data. In the context of PoR, Binance uses the properties of Merkle Trees to verify that individual user accounts are incorporated within the liabilities report inspected by an auditor. Each user can verify their asset holdings using their unique generated Merkle hash/record ID. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process: Verify Ownership of Address: Binance first verifies that the ownership of wallets (both cold and hot wallets) used in the PoR process belong to the exchange. Snapshot of User Balances: A snapshot of asset holdings within each customer's account is taken at a specific date and time. Generation of Merkle Tree: Binance generates an underlying data block by linking the hashed user ID and balance of each user. Based on all users' data, a Merkle tree is then created. If any account ID or balance in the leaf node changes, the Merkle root will also change. Consequently, every user can verify whether their assets are included in the leaf node. zk-SNARKs in the Verification Process Along with Merkle Trees, Binance also utilizes zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) in the verification process. A zk-SNARK is a proof protocol that allows one to prove that they know a value without revealing what that value is. In the case of Binance, the exchange uses a zk-SNARK to demonstrate that all the leaf nodes' balance sets (i.e., user account balances) contribute to the exchange’s claimed total user asset balance. Each user can easily access their leaf node to see that it was included in the process. The use of zk-SNARKs follows a few steps: Verify Ownership of Address: Like in the previous process, Binance verifies the ownership of the wallets (both cold and hot wallets) used in the PoR process. Snapshot of User Balances: Again, a snapshot of asset holdings within each customer's account is taken. Generate zk-SNARKs Proof: zk-SNARKs proof files are generated for each user. This allows every user to easily access their leaf node and verifies that the total net balance of the user is greater than or equal to zero. In addition to these self-verification methods, Binance also uses third-party audits to provide audit reports, further bolstering the security and transparency of the verification process.

This shows that the company has more than enough reserves to meet all potential customer withdrawals. PoR aims to increase transparency, safety, and user protection in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As such, it discourages exchanges from misusing user funds and promotes trust among users. In line with this, Binance users can verify their account's inclusion in the last PoR verification themselves, further emphasizing the exchange's commitment to transparency and user trust. How Proof of Reserves (PoR) Works with Merkle Trees To ensure that it holds all user assets 1:1, Binance has implemented a system that leverages Merkle trees. A Merkle Tree is a cryptographic tool that facilitates the condensation of large volumes of data into a single hash, called a Merkle Root. This root acts as a cryptographic ""seal"" that summarizes all the input data. Furthermore, Merkle Trees allow users to verify specific contents included within a particular set of sealed data. In the context of PoR, Binance uses the properties of Merkle Trees to verify that individual user accounts are incorporated within the liabilities report inspected by an auditor. Each user can verify their asset holdings using their unique generated Merkle hash/record ID. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process: Verify Ownership of Address: Binance first verifies that the ownership of wallets (both cold and hot wallets) used in the PoR process belong to the exchange. Snapshot of User Balances: A snapshot of asset holdings within each customer's account is taken at a specific date and time. Generation of Merkle Tree: Binance generates an underlying data block by linking the hashed user ID and balance of each user. Based on all users' data, a Merkle tree is then created. If any account ID or balance in the leaf node changes, the Merkle root will also change. Consequently, every user can verify whether their assets are included in the leaf node. zk-SNARKs in the Verification Process Along with Merkle Trees, Binance also utilizes zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) in the verification process. A zk-SNARK is a proof protocol that allows one to prove that they know a value without revealing what that value is. In the case of Binance, the exchange uses a zk-SNARK to demonstrate that all the leaf nodes' balance sets (i.e., user account balances) contribute to the exchange’s claimed total user asset balance. Each user can easily access their leaf node to see that it was included in the process. The use of zk-SNARKs follows a few steps: Verify Ownership of Address: Like in the previous process, Binance verifies the ownership of the wallets (both cold and hot wallets) used in the PoR process. Snapshot of User Balances: Again, a snapshot of asset holdings within each customer's account is taken. Generate zk-SNARKs Proof: zk-SNARKs proof files are generated for each user. This allows every user to easily access their leaf node and verifies that the total net balance of the user is greater than or equal to zero. In addition to these self-verification methods, Binance also uses third-party audits to provide audit reports, further bolstering the security and transparency of the verification process.

This announcement was made after the deadline for the voluntary return of funds expired. The exploiter used vulnerable versions of the Vyper programming language to launch reentrancy attacks on targeted stable pools, leading to significant losses. Following the attack, Curve and other affected protocols offered a 10% bug bounty to the exploiter, totaling more than $6 million. In response, the hacker returned stolen assets to two projects, Alchemix and JPEGd, but did not refund other affected pools. What is a reentrancy attack?A reentrancy attack, the method used by the exploiter in this case, is a common security vulnerability in smart contracts, especially those running on blockchain platforms like Ethereum. In a nutshell, a reentrancy attack allows an attacker to repeatedly call a functiorn in a smart contract while a previous call to that same function has not yet finished executing. The Vyper programming language, which was used to build the targeted stable pools in this case, is a contract-oriented language similar to Solidity, another popular language for writing smart contracts on Ethereum. While Vyper is designed with a stronger emphasis on security and simplicity, it is not immune to reentrancy attacks, which are a pervasive problem in the world of smart contracts. During a reentrancy attack, an exploiter can drain funds from a contract by recursively calling a function that withdraws funds. In this case, the exploiter managed to drain more than $61 million from several of Curve's stable pools, illustrating the severity of the attack and the poterntial impact of these types of vulnerabilities in the DeFi space. The incident underscores the importance of proper security practices and rigorous code review in the development of smart contracts. Despite the relative maturity of DeFi, the risk of smart contract vulnerabilities like reentrancy attacks remains, necessitating ongoing vigilance and robust security measures from DeFi projects.What's at stake for Curve Finance? Curve has now extended its bounty to the public, promising a reward equivalent to 10% of the remaining exploited funds (currently $1.85 million) to anyone who can identify the exploiter in a way that results in legal conviction.

As Asia’s markets open after the weekend, bitcoin (BTC) is at $29,012 while ether (ETH) is changing hands at $1,827 – which made for a volatility-free weekend.  “Another week of relative stability for BTC and ETH bodes well for bulls,” Joe DiPasquale, CEO of BitBull Capital said in a note. ""There have been some developments in the space, ranging from the Curve hack to more altcoin mania on Base. The market has, however, not reacted too harshly, and ETH has managed to defend $1800.”  Aside from shenanigans in Decentralized Finance (DeFi), which never fails to deliver, the broader crypto market is expected to be slow until a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is approved.  The amount of liquid and highly liquid Bitcoin supply is at its lowest since 2018, while illiquid supply reaches all-time highs, and long-term holders are stashing coins away, Blockware Intelligence wrote in a recent newsletter.

In a recent note, K33 Research’s Vetle Lunde, calls July’s trading volume “anemic” but writes that the market is on a precipice of change.  The crypto market experienced an atypical drought with remarkably low trading volumes and BTC volatility near five-year lows, but the low activity could lead to a sudden eruption of volatility, he writes, with potential catalysts including ETF filings, ongoing legal matters, and structural pressures, prompting strategies such as passive long volume exposure and gradual BTC accumulation.  “A deep crypto sleep tends to be followed by a violent wake-up. The market’s volatility pressure is about to climax, and that an eruption is near,"" he said in the note.  The only question is, when?
