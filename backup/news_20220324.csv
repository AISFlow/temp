13220507,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=486811,1648162841,Bitcoin Miner Revenue Grows By 7%. Here’s How Much They Made,"Bitcoin miner revenue is once again on the rise. This time around, the miners have seen a significant bump in their returns from their mining activities in the space of a single week. This increase in revenue coincides with the increase in the hash rate coupled with a rise in the number of transactions carried out in a day. Daily fees have dropped during this time though, so let&apos;s take a look at the numbers. Bitcoin Miner Revenue Jumps The previous week, bitcoin miner revenues had come out to a little over $36.5 million daily recorded on the part of the miners.

42435212,wOc5H8d0GcW5NDeNpBu8Gc,1648162281,First Mover Asia: Taiwan GameFi Company Gets a Boost in Its Quest to Develop a More Entertaining Game; Altcoins Stand Out,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and ether rose, but several major altcoins had even bigger days.  Insights: A Taiwan-based GameFi company's $5 million seed round will help its efforts to create technologically advanced – and entertaining – games.  Technician's take: BTC momentum signals are on the verge of turning positive for the first time since August 2021.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $44,020 +3.4%  Ether (ETH): $3,115 +3.3%  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Ethereum Classic ETC +9.6% Smart Contract Platform Solana SOL +9.1% Smart Contract Platform Cardano ADA +8.6% Smart Contract Platform  Top Losers  There are no losers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Bitcoin has a good day; several altcoins even better ones  Bitcoin and most other major cryptos spent most of Thursday well into the green, seemingly buoyed by remarks at one point by a high-ranking member of Russia's national legislature, who said that the country might accept bitcoin from countries on which it is on good terms as payment for oil and other resources.  The largest crypto by market cap had recently gained over 3.4% over the past 24 hours and was trading over $44,000, a threshold it crossed earlier in the day as many investors seemed at least temporarily willing to commit to riskier assets.  Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, had risen similarly, and was changing hands at over 3,100. Several altcoins fared even better, including popular meme coin DOGE, which spiked over 7% at one point, and SOL, which climbed over 8.5%.  Cardano's ADA and Axie Infinity's AXS were up over 7% and 22%, respectively. Crypto prices dovetailed with gains in equity markets. The tech-focused Nasdaq was up almost 2%, while the S&P 500 rose 1.4%. Many analysts have seen an increasing correlation between digital assets and stocks.  The comments by Russian Duma deputy Pavel Zavalny, who said that countries could pay ""in hard currency,"" or in different currencies, including bitcoin, underlined arguments that bitcoin is useful as a means of exchange that is not subject to centralized financial services organizations. It also supported critics' contention that Russia will use cryptocurrency to evade economic sanctions from countries who oppose its unprovoked invasion of neighboring Ukraine.  At the summit of world leaders in Brussels, U.S. President Joe Biden raised the possibility of removing Russia from the G20, the forum of largely industrialized countries that addresses global economic issues. Biden said the U.S. would donate $1 billion to help with the exodus of Ukrainians – now at over three million – escaping their war-torn country, and take in 100,000 immigrants from Ukraine.  Crypto received an additional boost when Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock (BLK), confirmed that the world's largest asset manager was exploring how to serve clients with digital currencies. Fink cited increasing interest from clients around digital currencies in a letter to shareholders Thursday. Fink's comments countered his previous assessment of client interest in crypto last July when he said that he was not seeing much demand for digital assets.  In an interview with CoinDesk TV's First Mover program, The Strategic Funds' co-managing director Marc Lopresti said that the importance of Fink's comments and the surging interest of major institutional investors could not be ""overstated.""  ""This is a trend that started in January last year by most accounts, and that ongoing drumbeat of adoption – acceptance by the traditional finance of banks through wealth management firms, brokerage houses, asset managers – is absolutely a trend that catalyzed and propelled a lot of price action that we saw in Bitcoin and other cryptos last year,"" Lopresti said. ""Institutional adoption of a new asset class almost always drives appreciation of the price and the value in the short- and medium-term and 99% of the time over the long term.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,520 +1.4%  DJIA: 34,707 +1.0%  Nasdaq: 14,901 +1.9%  Gold: 1,957 +0.6%  Insights  See Wan Toong received a boost on Thursday in his quest to create online games that are technologically superior to their predecessors but also fun.  The chief technology officer for Taiwan-based gaming company Red Door Digital closed a $5 million seed round to build high-quality games for the Web 3 ecosystem. The company will use the funding from M6, Shima Capital, Maven Capital, Cryptology Asset Group and LucidBlue Ventures to build out the studio’s proprietary game-theory models, which the company said will “drive the scalability and sustainability of the in-game economy.”  “Web 3 and the metaverse might be buzzwords right now, but more immersive online interactions is the undeniable trajectory for gaming, and we want to make games that bring mainstream gamers onboard,” Red Door Digital CEO Joseph Derflinger told CoinDesk.  In an interview with CoinDesk's First Mover Asia newsletter last week, Toong bemoaned many recent games' inability to entertain players, even as he was praising the improvements that GameFi is bringing to the space. This failure to engage users threatens to undermine the user experience, yet many gaming companies have hesitated to take creative risks that might not pay off.  Toong spoke longingly of the earlier, console era of gaming when ""everyone was trying to outperform each other and find creative ways to make interesting games that capture attention.” He added: ""It [gaming] seems to be consolidated and has become a more corporate, money-making thing rather than more creative. I think everyone’s trying to survive or trying to be very conservative in their approach.”  Red Door Digital has three games in development, with the first, Reign of Terror, set for release in the summer of 2022. Toong is hoping that at least one of them, or a future project, will become a masterpiece to rival World of Warcraft and Everquest, two games from the massively multiplayer online game boom that followed the console era but also was able to take advantage of technology breakthroughs while keeping sight of gaming's purpose to delight.  ***  A win for the stablecoin community  Proponents of stablecoins enjoyed the announcement that Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) had teamed up with crypto custodian Fireblocks to mint a stablecoin pegged to the Australian dollar.  The bank said that it was the first time a major bank has been involved in the creation of a stablecoin. ANZ said that it had created the stablecoin for Victor Smorgon Group, a large family office based in Australia, which plans to use it to trade on the Melbourne-based exchange Zerocap.  ""An ANZ-issued Australian dollar stablecoin is a first step in enabling our customers to find a safe and secure gateway to the digital economy,"" said ANZ Banking Services Portfolio Lead Nigel Dobson in a press release.     Technician's take  Bitcoin Strengthens Above $43K; Resistance at $46K-$51K  Bitcoin (BTC) continues to gather upside momentum after breaking above minor resistance at $43,500. The cryptocurrency could see further upside toward $46,700, a price level where prior rallies have stalled.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is not yet overbought, which means buyers could remain active into the Asia trading day. On the weekly chart, the RSI is neutral, which typically supports an upswing in price, albeit within a year-long trading range between $30,000 and $68,000.  Further, momentum signals are a few days away from turning positive on the weekly chart for the first time since August 2021. That could encourage short-term price strength, consistent with relief rallies in equities.  Still, upside could be limited around the $51,000 resistance level, especially given negative momentum signals on the monthly chart.

This “fact-finding study” is due on June 16.  Austin’s plan vaults it to the forefront of U.S. cities that view crypto as a potentially lucrative municipal energizer. Mayors in Miami, New York and Jackson, Tenn., have similarly leaned into crypto initiatives over the past year.  “Everyone is looking for innovative solutions to tackle municipal challenges, and this may be an option we look to in Austin,” Mayor Steve Adler tweeted on March 18 after a meeting with 25 mayors.  “My support for this does not” signal whether bitcoin payments are a good thing or a bad thing for the municipality to accept, council member Anna Kitchen said, highlighting this was a proposal “for analysis, not for action.” A number of other council members echoed her narrow support.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/24/city-of-austin-approves-fact-finding-study-for-tax-payments-in-bitcoin-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0fdf9f60906db92fda613861e306d8699386a408-960x669.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Brands such as Estée Lauder, Tommy Hilfiger, Dolce & Gabbana and Forever 21 are all participating in the virtual fashion event. Many spent weeks laying claim to metaverse-ready trademarks in what now appears to have been a preemptive brand protection strategy ahead of their NFT premiere.  With the rise of digital goods and metaverse shopping experiences, Decentraland’s Fashion Week seeks to provide a space for people to express themselves and expand the understanding of their own self through wearables on their avatars, said Sam Hamilton, Decentraland’s creative director.  “I see people being much more outrageous in the metaverse”, Hamilton told CoinDesk in a phone interview. “People will see a really great use case for NFTs” as a result of the event.  Fashion shows, galleries and brand-hosted panels will pop up across a newly-developed corner of Decentraland called Fashion District through March 27. Virtual real estate company Metaverse Group purchased the 6,000-square-foot plot last November for a record $2.4 million.  How to strut in Decentraland  By visiting the website and connecting an Ethereum wallet, or simply playing as a guest, anyone can experience Metaverse Fashion Week.

The Trustury interface and Guardian application, announced Friday by Meeco, a data privacy and digital identity specialist building on Hedera, also has the support of the HBAR Foundation, which recently launched a $100 million sustainable impact fund.  The project enables Hedera-based tokens to maintain a linked relationship to the roles, actors and data created by ecological projects that follow a science-backed methodology, according to a press release.

The system comes with “privacy by design,” said Meeco CEO Katryna Dow, courtesy of some zero-knowledge proof technology layered on top.  This allows for different levels of access and visibility, depending on whether a user might be an auditor, or simply someone trying to make a decision about some product or service, said Dow.  “From a privacy point of view, you may not want to have all the information in terms of that address or location exposed,” she said.",POSITIVE,HBAR,REGULATION | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET | HBAR,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/24/emissions-tracking-project-goes-live-on-hedera-as-hbar-stands-up-100m-esg-push,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1962447185d0a53e93abd1510c328019a2267175-5760x3839.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

For making good crypto trades you need to know Dow Theory and Japanese candlestick charts. Every historical price, volume, and time interval is available in cryptography. A chart is used to observe investment opportunities in a digital currency based on its past price movements. By reading cryptocurrency charts, investors can identify market trends and predict the future price movements of an asset. Cryptocurrency Chart Patterns Only a few chart patterns have stood the test of time. There is no &apos;proven&apos; chart pattern that works better than another, unlike less subjective analytical tools. Following are the chart patterns available. Price Channels Create a series of highs and lows by creating two ascending or descending parallel lines. Prices tend to bounce between these levels of support (lower) and resistance (higher). While most traders buy lower and sell higher, breakouts and breakdowns can be influential. Ascending &amp; Descending Triangle One horizontal line connects highs or lows, and a second sloped line connects rising highs or falling lows. In a right triangle, the price tends to break out or break down from the horizontal line in the direction of the sloped line.

A break out above the resistance trend line may see prices rally to Q4 2021 highs. Past Performance The NEO price is stable on the last trading day. However, it is up 13 percent in the previous week versus the USDT. Technically, NEO prices are in an $8 trade range. There are clear caps at $18 on the lower end and $26 on the upper hand. At spot rates, sellers are in control from a top-down preview. Nonetheless, this could change if there is a break above the multi-week resistance trend line past $26. NEO Technical Analysis In the medium term, it appears as if NEO buyers have the upper hand as per the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart. The primary support is at $18 where there is a double bottom pattern. As such, there a leg up to $30 and even $54 may form if buyers convincingly clear $26—the immediate liquidation level. Since the recent rally has decent trading volumes, aggressive traders may load the dips above $20, targeting $26 and later $30. Conversely, a dump unwinding recent gains below $20 cancels the bullish preview. What to Expect of NEO The recent upswing towards $26 has relatively high trading volumes pointing to trader confidence. However, a solid break above the immediate liquidation level would complete the double bottom.

42422857,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qU7h,1648153681,Market Wrap: Cryptos Rise as Russia Mulls Bitcoin for Oil Payments; Dogecoin Rallies,"Most cryptocurrencies traded higher on Thursday after Russia's Duma committee chairman suggested during a news conference that bitcoin (BTC) could be accepted as payment for the nation's oil and other resource exports.  Russia's announcement contributed to a spike in BTC above $44,000, although cryptos were already tracking upside moves in equities earlier in the New York trading day. Still, traditional safe-haven assets, such as gold and the U.S. dollar, also rose on Thursday, suggesting some caution among global investors.  Sign up for Market Wrap, our daily newsletter explaining what happened today in crypto markets – and why. Coming April 4.  Alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) remain in the lead, evidenced by a decline in bitcoin's market cap relative to the total crypto market cap over the past two weeks.  Dogecoin (DOGE), the popular dog-themed meme token, rallied as much as 6% in the past 24 hours, compared with a 4% rise in BTC over the same period. Meanwhile, Solana's SOL token was up 10% and Axie Infinity's gaming token AXS surged by 20% on Thursday.  Typically, a rally in altcoins signals a turnaround in the overall crypto market as investors increase their appetite for risk.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $43,877, +3.86%    ●Ether (ETH): $3,106, +4.75%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4,520, +1.43%    ●Gold: $1,962 per troy ounce, +1.33%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.34%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Meme stocks pump ahead of bitcoin  Elsewhere, meme stocks tend to lead traditional equities higher, similar to the risk-on nature of altcoins in the crypto market.  Meme stocks are popular among retail investors who exchange trading ideas through social media. In 2020, internet memes were created to symbolize periods of sky-high prices.  The chart below shows a recent uptick in the correlation between bitcoin and an index of meme stocks, created by Lev Borodovsky, editor of The Daily Shot newsletter. Several meme stocks, such as AMC Entertainment (AMC), rallied as much as 30% over the past week.  DeFi still lagging  Decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens, however, continue to lag behind large market cap cryptos.  The chart below plots CoinDesk's DeFi Index (DFX) versus CoinDesk's Large Cap Index (DLCX). Over the past few months, the gap between DLCX and DFX has widened, which could indicate less appetite for risk among crypto investors.  Still, recent rallies in DeFi tokens could lead to outperformance versus large-cap tokens, similar to what occurred in mid-2021. For example, DeFi tokens such as AAVE and AMP have rallied as much as 9% over the past week, compared with a 7% rise in BTC over the same period.  Altcoin roundup  Dogecoin leaps to 1-month high as ATM operator adds to crypto lineup: Dogecoin (DOGE) touched a one-month high Thursday, a day after Bitcoin of America announced plans to add support for the doggy-themed cryptocurrency to its network of more than 1,800 ATMs across 31 U.S. states. DOGE’s price rose as much as 6% in the past 24 hours, touching $0.141 at one point during the day, the highest since Feb. 21. Read more here.

Gordon Brad Beckstead, 57, admitted to helping the architects of the scheme – which defrauded investors of about $722 million over five years – cover their tracks.  The scheme ran from April 2014 to December 2019, when three of the BitClub leaders were arrested and charged with fraud and the sale of unregistered securities. BitClub purported to sell shares of nonexistent crypto mining pools to gullible investors, only to pay them back with money from newer investors, according to the government.  In addition to Beckstead and the architects of the scheme, the government has also nabbed a high-level promoter and a Romanian programmer who designed and operated the site.  Beckstead, who was also an investor in BitClub, said he controlled bank accounts associated with the scheme and its alleged “creator and operator,"" Matthew Brent Goettsche, in order to hide Goettsche’s association with the scam and evade tax reporting requirements.  The Nevada man, who is a CPA, also admitted to helping at least two outside tax preparers to create false tax returns for Goettsche in 2017 and 2018. The returns didn't include over $60 million in income Goettsche received through his role in BitClub.  According to a press release issued by the Department of Justice on Thursday, Beckstead’s tax hijinks shorted the government of $20 million federal income taxes.  Beckstead pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and one count of aiding in the preparation of a false tax return. He faces up to 23 years in prison, as well as a fine.  UPDATE (April 27, 2022, 19:54 UTC): Adds ""alleged"" to ""Ponzi scheme.""

42435208,wOc5H8d0GcW5NDeNpBu7w2,1648150089,Bitcoin Retakes $44K Amid Broad Crypto Rally,"Bitcoin (BTC) is up more than 3% over the last 24 hours, climbing to a three-week high of $44,200 earlier on Wednesday before modestly pulling back to $44,000.  Helping the mood for the bulls was that Pavel Zavalny, chairman of Russia’s congressional energy committee, earlier Thursday suggested bitcoin could work as the country considers hard currency alternatives for oil sales given the sanctions imposed on Russian companies by the West.  An analyst from Split Capital took note of not just the price spike following those comments, but a big jump in bitcoin open interest.  U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock said bitcoin’s price strength was notable given a 25% increase in oil prices over the past week. Analysts at the firm believe the oil run needs to cool for bitcoin to continue with gains.  GlobalBlock also said that the accumulation of bitcoin by large investors bodes well for the cryptocurrency. That includes Luna Foundation Guard’s plan to purchase $3 billion of bitcoin in the short term and $10 billion long term.  That’s a lot of buy pressure, GlobalBlock said, explaining that it expects seller exhaustion and a run above $45,000 as long as oil prices don’t reach new highs.  Elsewhere in the crypto market, ether (ETH) is up 4% to $3,111, its highest level since Feb. 16, while cardano (ADA) and solana (SOL) are both up by about 10%.

42435194,wOc5H8d0GcW5NDeNpBu6wI,1648149952,ExxonMobil Running Pilot Project to Supply Flared Gas for Bitcoin Mining: Report,"Oil giant ExxonMobil (XOM) is running a pilot project to use what would otherwise be wasted gas from its North Dakota oil wells to power bitcoin mining operations, Bloomberg reported Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter.  The excess natural gas would have otherwise been burned off, or flared, because of the lack of pipelines.  The oil company is also looking to supply flared gas to bitcoin miners at other sites around the globe, according to the report.  ExxonMobil has a deal with Crusoe Energy Systems, one of the pioneers of using wasted gas to power bitcoin mining operations, to take gas from an oil well pad in the Bakken shale basin to power mobile generators that are used for bitcoin mining operations, Bloomberg said, citing the unnamed source.  The news comes after another major oil company, ConocoPhillips (COP), said it's running its own pilot project to route excess natural gas from one of its Bakken region projects in North Dakota to supply necessary power for a bitcoin (BTC) mining operation.  “ExxonMobil continuously evaluates emerging technologies aimed at reducing flaring volumes across our operations,” ExxonMobil spokeswoman Sarah Nordin told CoinDesk in an email, adding that the company recently announced that its emissions reduction plans are expected to achieve World Bank Zero Routine Flaring by 2030.  Most recently, Crusoe Energy was recognized for its “innovative” solution to flaring globally by the World Bank’s Global Gas Flaring Reduction Initiative report. In the flaring process, excess natural gas is burned off into the atmosphere as part of oil drilling operations; it has become standard industry practice because of the lack of transportation infrastructure.  Nordin declined to comment on “rumors and speculations” about ExxonMobil’s pilot project, and Crusoe Energy also declined to comment on Bloomberg’s story.  Shares of ExxonMobil were flat on Thursday.  In 2019, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips were among the founding members of the OOC Oil & Gas Blockchain Consortium, a group of energy companies looking to establish “key blockchain standards, frameworks and capabilities” within the industry.

It has been steadily climbing since the beginning of the year. Fair Share of Trouble for Cardano The growth of the Cardano Network as observed has been quite sluggish. However, the founder and CEO of the network, Charles Hoskinson has been keen on scaling the blockchain to be more favorable for applications to launch on the mainnet. Hoskinson is expecting a &apos;large wave&apos; of new applications, post the upcoming network upgrade named &apos;Vasil&apos; to roll out. It is expected to attract a massive influx. Progressive Growth of Total Value Locked by Cardano Only two weeks ago, on March 9, the Miniswap DEX launched on the network and gained increased popularity. Additionally, the present DEX also garnered an influx of funds that noted a surge of $200 Million in the TVL. The previous DEX, SundaeSwap launched in January, has permanently taken a backseat with $111 Million TVL. However, SundaeSwap couldn&apos;t sustain all the issues the users began to have due to failed transactions. These issues were then blamed on network congestion by the developers. TVL on Cardano Skyrockets The cryptocurrency-centered analytics firm DeFi Lama&apos;s collected data shows that the Cardano Protocol&apos;s TVL has successfully succeeded the $300 million mark.

42407274,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVUN0D,1648149915,7 Wild Bitcoin Mining Rigs,"Close your eyes and visualize bitcoin mining. Maybe you see nothing, as the very concept of “bitcoin mining” can seem abstract and fuzzy. Maybe you see a warehouse stuffed with racks of ugly machines. (Warmer.) Or maybe your imagination summons a team of digital trolls who go “mining,” virtual pickaxes in hand, whistling while they work, to uproot nuggets of bitcoin from the internet.  Then there are these setups. Whatever you imagined, you probably didn’t envision mining rigs like these. An open secret in the bitcoin community is that one of the liabilities of mining – it emits a ton of heat – can be flipped to an asset. “I find the space heater offensive,” said Colin Sullivan, CEO of MintGreen, a company that harnesses bitcoin mining to power sustainable heating. A space heater requires power and emits heat, said Sullivan, but it does nothing else. Bitcoin (BTC) miners? They also require power, and they also emit heat, but they happen to cough out bitcoin.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Mining Week  A second open secret in the mining community: With clever innovation, virtually any power source can fuel a bitcoin miner. These two principles – miners pump heat, and miners can be powered by just about anything – have unleashed some creative and even wild mining rigs. So get ready to sip some bitcoin whiskey, convert your old car tires into bitcoin and relax in the bitcoin hot tub.  Bitcoin-powered whiskey  Sullivan, the founder of MintGreen, has used bitcoin miners to heat his home for years. That got him thinking. What else could he heat with bitcoin? It turns out the answer is whiskey. MintGreen now has a partnership with Shelter Point Distillery, a Vancouver, British Columbia-based label that makes whiskey, vodka and gin. Shelter Point likes to add a bit of heat to their barrels, which accelerates the whiskey’s aging process. Starting in May, eight S9 miners will sit in a rotating wheel – almost like a Ferris wheel – that’s called the “tumbler.” The application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) heat the room that contains the barrels. As Sullivan said, “Proof-of-work meets whiskey proof.” (Next on MintGreen’s agenda? Using bitcoin to heat an entire city.)  The bitcoin hot tub  Jesse Peltan had three S9 miners. He also had a hot tub. What if he combined the chocolate of those ASICs with the peanut butter of that tub? Peltan used the heat of the miners to raise the temperature of the water, and as a final flourish, he connected the system to Wi-Fi so he could say, “Alexa, turn the jets on.” In a Twitter thread describing the project, Peltan said that the bitcoin-powered tub now heats up faster than it did originally, but admits that it’s not exactly practical, as “it’s just meant to be cool.” One fan of the contraption is none other than Elon Musk, who took a look at the setup and concluded, “Nice.”  Bitcoin goes nuclear  Coming soon to Berwick, Pennsylvania: A bitcoin mine that’s powered by nuclear energy. Talen Energy Corp., which owns a nuclear power plant, entered into a joint venture with a bitcoin mining company called TeraWulf. Talen President Alex Hernandez said this partnership will create “zero-carbon coins,” according to World Nuclear News, and will begin operation in mid-2022. This comes on the heels of Compass Mining announcing a 20-year deal with Oklo, a nuclear fission company, that begins production in 2023. As Oklo’s CEO Jacob DeWitte told CoinDesk, the nuclear and bitcoin partnership can be a “beacon” of clean energy.  Crypto tires  Think about the rubber tires that go on cars. They often end up in landfills. “Just here in America, there are 350 million waste tires a year that need to be disposed of,” said Jason Williams, co-founder of PRTI, Inc. and creator of the “Going Parabolic” account on Crypto Twitter. Williams said that 20% of these tires get “illegally dumped in some environment, and that’s not good.” So he thought of a solution. He developed a patent that heats up a tire (without burning it), turns it to gas and then captures that gas stream and converts it to liquid fuel. That fuel becomes bitcoin. In North Carolina, the PRTI plant processes 1.2 million tires a year, according to Williams, and uses that energy to mine bitcoin and ether (ETH).  Williams said he captures the equivalent of 1 gallon of oil per tire, as there’s loads of energy stored in rubber. “The tires were my battery,” said Williams. “They’re my stored energy source, and I can unlock that with my technology.” The mine has been in operation since 2015.

Striking Photos From Siberia to Spain  Swimming in mining pools  “Imagine if your pool is always nice and warm, and the warmer you keep your pool, the more money you make,” said a Minneapolis-based bitcoin miner who goes by the alias Coin Heated. He has used a combination of S9s and S17s to heat both his home and his 17,000-gallon swimming pool, using Braiins software to tweak the power depending on the conditions of both the weather and the mining potential. Often it’s on a low power setting (to keep the pool warm but not too hot), but when China banned mining, for example, Coin Heated knew this was a “once in a lifetime” opportunity to crank up his miners and earn more bitcoin, even if it meant the pool would heat to 115 degrees. “I’m like, sorry kids, you can’t swim right now, the pool is too hot, I’ve gotta hash.”  Drill, baby, drill (and mine bitcoin)  When companies drill for oil, one of the byproducts is natural gas, and it can leak. “Producing oil is similar to opening a can of pop,” said Steve Barbour, founder of Upstream Data. “There’s a lot of gas and solution that breaks out. A pop can foams over, and so do oil wells.”  Oil execs are smart, and they often have solutions for this, such as capturing the gas and selling it. But that’s not always feasible. Sometimes there’s no pipeline or means to ship it. This “stranded” natural gas is usually wasted … unless you’re using one of Barbour’s Upstream portable mining rigs – basically an 8-by-16 metal shack that can be dropped right onto the oil field, ready to convert wasted gas into crypto. This is not just theoretical. Over 250 of Upstream’s portable miners are in operation, from Texas to Wyoming to Alberta, cranking out bitcoin on the oil fields.  Volcanic bitcoin  This has potential to be the wildest rig in history. El Salvador’s bitcoin-happy president, Nayib Bukele, announced that its Conchagua volcano, which emits geothermal energy, would soon power a bitcoin mine. A $1 billion “volcano bond” will fund the project. But that’s not all! The Bitcoin Volcano would anchor an entire Bitcoin City, and as Bukele described it, “Residential areas, commercial areas, services, museums, entertainment, bars, restaurants, airport, port, rail - everything devoted to Bitcoin.”  Further Reading from CoinDesk’s Mining Week  The State of Bitcoin and Ethereum Mining in 10 Charts  It's been a roller coaster year for Bitcoin and Ethereum mining: Here is what the data shows.

Stablecoin Supply Ratio May Be Able To Predict Bitcoin Buy And Sell Signals As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the stablecoin supply ratio may help us find BTC buy or sell signals. The &apos;stablecoin supply ratio&apos; (or SSR in short) is an indicator that measures the ratio between the market cap of Bitcoin and that of all stablecoins. In simpler terms, what this metric tells us is how the supply of the stablecoins compare with that of BTC. Investors usually use these fiat-tied coins when they want to escape volatile markets and hold on until the price reaches a viable reentry point. So, in a way stablecoins represent potential dry powder for Bitcoin. When the value of the SSR is high, it means the supply of BTC is much higher than stablecoins right now. This means that there is lesser potential buying power available in the market and hence could be bearish for the price of the crypto. On the other hand, low values of the ratio implies there is a decent amount of buying power available in the form of stablecoins at the moment. Naturally, this can be bullish for the value of BTC.

42435214,wOc5H8d0GcW5NDeNpBu8Qu,1648145897,"Avalanche Crypto Event Woos 3.5K to Barcelona With Late Parties, Late Starts, Long Lines","The Avalanche blockchain's conference in Barcelona, Spain, this week drew about 3,500 participants paying up to $600 each, organizers said, offering a fresh sign of the increasing popularity of in-person cryptocurrency events as the coronavirus retreats.  The attendance figure compares with about 500 participants at an Avalanche event held last year in conjunction with a broader industry gathering in Portugal. Officials billed the Barcelona event as the inaugural full conference dedicated to the Avalanche blockchain.  The popularity of the Avalanche Summit might reveal enduring interest in one of last year's hottest blockchain projects despite a 24% drop this year in the price for its native token AVAX. The number of attendees at the Avalanche conference exceeds the 2,000 who attended a major gathering last year in Lisbon for Solana, a rival blockchain.  Sean Farrell, head of digital-asset strategy for the independent investment research firm FundStrat who traveled to the four-day event from New York, said he was ""impressed with the turnout and the overall energy.""  ""Despite most asset prices being well below all-time highs, there was a clear optimism and appetite to continue investing and building on Avalanche,” Farrell said. “I sensed a clear focus from developers on building out Avalanche’s subnet ecosystem in the coming months.”  The robust attendance at the Avalanche Summit might herald the return of crypto conferences as a key element of the industry workflow, providing in-person connections for the first time in years as coronavirus caseloads wane and remote working becomes increasingly the norm.  ETHDenver, an Ethereum-focused conference, drew about 8,500 in-person attendees last month to a venue to the mountainous U.S. state of Colorado. (Full disclosure: CoinDesk is hosting its own crypto conference in Austin, Texas, in June.)  AVAX price  Avalanche's AVAX token was one of the hottest cryptocurrencies of 2021, jumping 33-fold in price.  The 2022 year-to-date decline would be even steeper were it not for a big rally last week – with AVAX jumping 25% – possibly fueled, at least in part, by anticipation of the event in Barcelona.  The mostly male crowd drew from a wide variety of roles, including blockchain coders, venture capitalists, crypto traders, hedge fund executives, lawyers, marketers, designers, musicians, gamers and even some government officials.  Conference organizers said there were more than 30 side events apart from the official conference, with after-parties in some cases stretching to 4 a.m. It started Tuesday and runs through Friday, with a hackathon scheduled for the coming weekend.  Devon Ferreira, head of marketing for Ava Labs, the company behind the Avalanche blockchain, said organizers took pains to make the in-person event easy for attendees to enjoy. One specific thing was starting the daily agenda at noon – possibly a nod to the idea that a lot of the value at international business gatherings like this comes after-hours, especially in a city known for its late dinners.  “We realize that nobody ever comes back from a conference raving about the keynote that happened on Day Three,” Ferreira told CoinDesk.  Late nights  Jay Kurahashi-Sofue, vice president of marketing at Ava Labs, helped plan the event with Ferreira and said that they didn’t want to conform to the standard approach in crypto for events, which he described as hiring a convention center with an 8 a.m. start to 5 p.m. finish.  “We wanted to take risks and make sure the event didn’t feel corporate,” Kurahashi-Sofue said.  The official proceedings – more than 250 speakers across 60 panels – took place in Poble Espanyol, an open-air architectural museum in Barcelona, and the summit was spread across the 1929-built village with outdoor and indoor stages.  The Avalanche team erected a red-and-white-ceilinged structure referred to as the ""Eco-Dome"" where exhibitors set up booths not far from spreads of paella, tapas, Iberico ham and freshly caught prawns. There was plenty of the Spanish sparkling wine cava and vodka for attendees.  Tucked away from the main stage was an area known as the ""Zen Garden,'' where attendees could get massages, listen to live music in a yurt, meditate or even get a tattoo. The idea was to provide a venue for relaxation and mindfulness – a welcome contrast to the array of NFT-related art and seemingly random displays like giant TV screens displaying the head of sheep.  Ferreira, the Ava Labs marketing honcho, attributes the success of the event to the overall growth of interest in crypto and his belief that Avalanche is fast becoming the heir apparent to Ethereum, the world's second-biggest blockchain.  The highest price of a ticket was $600 for the four days, an apparent bargain compared with Solana’s Breakpoint conference in November in Lisbon, where tickets went for as much as $1,000 or up to $4,000 for VIP passes.",POSITIVE,AVAX | ETH,AVAX | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SOL | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/24/avalanche-crypto-event-woos-35k-to-barcelona-with-late-parties-late-starts-long-lines,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/868e13641bea60d881cd16a5c16a2b73109c25e1-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411822,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgDSe,1648145661,What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?,"Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are a special type of crypto asset that allows holders to prove their ownership of real or digital items – but most importantly, the latter.  These intangible items can include things like plots of virtual real estate in games like The Sandbox and Decentraland, to digital artwork like Beeple’s Everydays - The 2020 collection, and even images of cartoon apes.  While this might sound pretty underwhelming to the average person, you need to appreciate that in today’s ever-increasing digital world it’s incredibly difficult to authenticate or exercise ownership over things that anyone can simply screenshot, copy or download.  Imagine you’re a concept artist who creates digital artwork for gaming companies like Ubisoft or Treyarch. Now imagine you want to go it alone and sell your digital artwork online. To achieve this, you’d need to find some way of marking and tracking ownership of your pieces so that purchasers could prove they had original pieces and not just some screenshot. Otherwise, what’s the point of spending your money on it?  This is where NFTs come in.  What are NFTs?  Non-fungible tokens are tradable digital assets that contain information that essentially says, “the person in control of this crypto wallet address is the owner of a computer file, stored in this location.”  The computer file, as we’ve discussed, can be anything from an image to a GIF or audio clip.  What’s interesting about NFTs is even if you create 1,000 copies of the same image or file and mint the same number of NFTs to represent ownership of them, each copy of the image will be uniquely identifiable from the other 999 pieces based on the special type of information (called metadata) that each NFT token contains.  This means that while 1,000 investors might all have the same looking image in their wallets, they can each say “I specifically own copy number #.”  Think of it as an edition of a trading card with 1,000 exclusive copies, but where each card has its own serial number to distinguish it from others. In addition, the card with the serial number #1 on it would most likely go for a higher price and be more desirable than other copies in the edition.  Taking this concept even further, creators of these types of NFT collections incorporate different traits of varying degrees of rarity to further increase the value and scarcity of their pieces.  For instance, among the 1,000 pieces, a creator might decide that 10 of them will have a different colored background and only one of them will have a patterned background. By doing this, some purchasers interested in investing in the collection will naturally want to own the rarest pieces in the collection in the hope their value will rise more over time – assuming demand for the collection remains high.  Read more: What is ApeCoin and Who’s Behind It?  Now, let’s talk about fungibility – the part that gives non-fungible tokens their name. By definition, fungible tokens are those that can be mutually exchanged for another token like-for-like. For example, Bob can swap his one bitcoin for Alice’s one bitcoin and neither party will be better or worse off. With NFTs, this is not so straightforward.  While NFTs themselves are exchangeable (in the sense that you can buy and sell NFTs from/ to other people) the unique traits of each NFT mean it has its own distinct value. For instance, you couldn’t trade a shiny Charizard Pokemon card for a “Shoeless” Joe Jackson, 1909 American Caramel baseball card like-for-like. This is what’s meant by “non-fungible” when people talk about NFTs.  Other key characteristics of NFTs include:  Indestructible: Because all NFT data is stored on the blockchain via smart contracts, each token cannot be destroyed, removed or replicated. Ownership of these tokens is also immutable, which means gamers and collectors actually possess their NFTs, not the companies that create them. This contrasts with buying things like music from the iTunes store where users don't actually own what they’re buying, they just purchase the license to listen to the music.  Verifiable: Another benefit of storing historical ownership data on the blockchain is that items such as digital artwork can be traced back to the original creator, which allows pieces to be authenticated without the need for third-party verification.  How do NFTs work?  We’ve already identified that in order to be able to prove ownership of something digital, there needs to be some form of a transparent, immutable ledger that maintains a constant record of all NFTs, who owns them and where the files that they point to are kept.  This is where blockchain technology comes in. By leveraging the publicly distributed, immutable nature of blockchains, all NFTs can be stored in a transparent way, allowing anyone to check the authenticity of any NFT at any time.  Each time an NFT is transferred or created, the action is permanently recorded on the blockchain and timestamped, meaning it’s possible to trace any single NFT right back to its genesis – something that’s pretty handy if you want to make sure your cartoon ape or virtual kitty is genuine or not.  Read more: What is Blockchain Technology?  Now, let’s go back one step and discuss what NFTs are from a technical standpoint.  Crypto assets can be created from scratch but most developers when setting out to launch tokens will typically use an existing blueprint to streamline the process and save costs. Leading crypto projects such as Ethereum recognized early on that there needed to be some form of standardization among newly created crypto tokens to establish interoperability.  Ethereum token standards were developed to achieve exactly this. These involve specific sets of smart contract functions that a token must be able to perform in order to be compatible with all other tokens, platforms and services in the broader Ethereum ecosystem.  Ethereum token standards ERC-721 and ERC-1155 are the main blueprints created by Ethereum that allow developers to create and deploy their own non-fungible tokens on top of its blockchain.  Eos, Neo and Tron are examples of other leading blockchains that have also released their own NFT token standards to encourage developers to build and host NFTs on their blockchain networks.  Read More: How to Make, Buy and Sell NFTs  Finally, it’s important to note that it’s not just the fungibility of NFTs – albeit their lack of – that sets them aside from other types of cryptocurrencies. The infrastructure that supports NFTs is also different.  Unlike all other cryptocurrencies, NFTs cannot be listed, bought or sold on centralized or decentralized exchanges. Instead, users must use tailor-made NFT marketplaces to participate in the listing and trading of these assets. OpenSea and Rarible are among the most popular, but there are countless other options available depending on which NFT collection you’re interested in.  Why do NFTs matter?  Non-fungible tokens (NFT) have become hugely popular with crypto users and companies alike because of the way they revolutionized the gaming and collectibles space. Since June 2017 there has been a total of $25 billion spent on NFTs, including a further $21 billion in secondary sales.  For gamers and collectors, NFTs provide an opportunity for them to become the immutable owners of in-game items and other unique assets, as well as create and monetize structures like casinos and theme parks in virtual worlds.  They can also sell individual digitals items they accrue during gameplay such as costumes, avatars and in-game currency on a secondary market.  For artists, being able to sell artwork in digital form directly to a global audience of buyers without using an auction house or gallery allows them to keep a significantly greater portion of the profits they make from sales.  Royalties can also be programmed into digital artwork so that the creator receives a percentage of sale profits each time the artwork is sold to a new owner.  William Shatner, best known as Captain Kirk from “Star Trek,” ventured into digital collectibles in 2020 and issued 90,000 digital cards on the WAX blockchain showcasing various images of himself. Each card was initially sold for approximately $1 and now provides Shatner with passive royalty income every time one is resold.  Why do NFTs have value?  Like all assets, supply and demand are the key market drivers for price. Due to the scarce nature of NFTs and the high demand from gamers, collectors and investors, people are often prepared to pay a lot of money for them.  Some NFTs also have the potential to make their owners a lot of money. For instance, one gamer on the Decentraland virtual land platform decided to purchase 64 lots and combine them into a single estate. Dubbed “The Secrets of Satoshi’s Tea Garden,” it sold for $80,000 purely because of its desirable location and road access.  Another investor parted with $222,000 to purchase a segment of a digital Monaco racing track in the F1 Delta Time game. The NFT representing the piece of digital track allows the owner to receive 5% dividends from all races that take place on it, including entry ticket fees.  What are the most expensive NFTs?  The most expensive NFT sale to date took place in December 2021, when a fractionalized NFT artwork piece called “The Merge” was sold; 312,686 pieces of the artwork were shared among 28,983 different buyers for a collective price of $91.8 million.  Beeple’s Everydays: The First 5,000 Days piece takes second place, fetching $69.3 million at auction from a single buyer.  Finally, an NFT named “Clock” currently stands as the third-most expensive NFT ever bought – with 10,000 individuals forming an “AssangeDAO” to purchase the piece for $52.7 million. This piece is essentially a stopwatch that shows the total time WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been imprisoned. It was launched by Assange in partnership with digital artist Pak to raise funds for Assange’s ongoing, high-profile court case.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING,Ollie Leech,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-are-nfts-and-how-do-they-work,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a16e62870b46463a4f29858e3d54cd30b54bb6d0-1630x1223.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

He was responding to a report that Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao was jetting into El Salvador to assist with the country’s bitcoin bond issuance after the sale had been delayed earlier this week. FUD is short for fear, uncertainty and doubt.  In another tweet, Bukele confirmed the upcoming meeting with CZ, but said their discussion would be about issues unrelated to the so-called Volcano Bonds … “Unless he wants to buy some, of course,” he added.  Former Blockstream chief strategy officer and advisor on the design of the bond, Samson Mow, tweeted that “nothing has changed, just delays in the new law going to congress.” Bitfinex Chief Technology Officer Paolo Ardoino, whose company is managing the bond issuance, chimed in with his agreement, as did Bukele.  It was on Tuesday that El Salvador’s Finance Minister Alejandro Zelaya said the country had postponed its planned $1 billion bitcoin bond offering, initially scheduled to take place between March 15-20, because of unfavorable market conditions. ""I think this is not the time, there are some moves on the planet,"" he said.  Bukele also expressed his displeasure with goings-on in the U.S. Senate, where a bill looking to mitigate risks to the American financial system from El Salvador's adoption of bitcoin (BTC) was passed out of committee on Wednesday.  “Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought that the U.S. Government would be afraid of what we are doing here,” Bukele tweeted on Wednesday afternoon. “The U.S. Government DOES NOT stand for freedom and that is a proven fact,” he later added. “So we will stand for freedom … Game on!”  When the bill was initially introduced last month, Bukele tweeted: “OK boomers ...

42435195,wOc5H8d0GcW5NDeNpBu71R,1648141308,Meet the Libertarian Bitcoiner Considering a Run for New Hampshire’s Senate Seat,"Former executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation Bruce Fenton is considering a self-funded run for the Republican nomination for New Hampshire’s seat in the U.S. Senate.  The long-time bitcoin (BTC) proponent has been active in New Hampshire’s libertarian movement, the Free State Project, for several years. Though he describes himself as a libertarian, Fenton plans to run as a Republican – he sometimes refers to himself as a “Ron Paul Republican.”  Fenton told CoinDesk he wants to be an advocate for bitcoin on the federal level, arguing that his deep knowledge of the technology and crypto-related issues would be a boon for the industry. Fenton served as the head of the Bitcoin Foundation, a now-defunct nonprofit organization aimed at legitimizing bitcoin, from April 2015 to July 2016.  Fenton is not the first vocal supporter of crypto to consider running for office. Messari founder Ryan Selkis has been flirting with the idea of a run for U.S. Senate in 2024, ever since Terra founder Do Kwon was served by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) at a conference hosted by Messari.  And when they aren’t running themselves, bitcoiners are throwing money at crypto-friendly candidates such as Democrat Aarika Rhodes, an elementary school teacher trying to unseat Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.), who has emerged as one of crypto’s biggest opponents on Capitol Hill.  Big names (and deep pockets) in crypto, including Custodia Bank’s (formerly known as Avanti) Caitlin Long and ShapeShift founder Erik Voorhees, have already tweeted their support for Fenton.  As the crypto industry continues to grow and face regulatory obstacles, more crypto investors are becoming single-issue voters – a situation Fenton hopes to take advantage of.  “I’m in favor of limiting government involvement in our lives as much as possible,” Fenton said. “Whether it’s crypto or any other issue, I believe government should reduce regulatory burdens and get out of our lives and wallets.”  Fenton told CoinDesk he’s opposed to any new crypto regulations.  “Lawmakers should tear down existing obstacles rather than building new ones,” he said.  The political landscape  If Fenton decides to run, he plans to start his campaign with a self-funded injection of $5 million of personal bitcoin wealth, but told CoinDesk he’s open to accepting crypto donations and “other types of contributions” to his campaign.  Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), the state’s incumbent Democrat, is seeking reelection this year. Hassan is widely unpopular among her constituents, however, making her seat vulnerable to a Republican takeover.  New Hampshire’s Republican governor, Chris Sununu, was strongly expected to run against Hassan for the Senate seat, but declined the opportunity last November, leaving the race open to lesser-known candidates, including state senator Chuck Morse.  Fenton, if he decides to enter the fray, would be a latecomer.  “Right now I’m talking strategy and support with a great group of folks,” Fenton told CoinDesk. “Timing is key since the primary is soon.” The primary election is slated for Sept. 13.  But, despite the challenges, Fenton believes he’s well-positioned to make a positive impact on New Hampshire – and the crypto industry – if elected.  “We are facing times of true good and evil,” Fenton said, adding “Tyranny versus freedom. The violence in Ukraine is a symptom of a larger problem of evil which is manifested in centralized power structures who use violence.”  “I think bitcoiners have a better-than-average understanding of human rights, freedom and peace. We all have to do all we can to further peace and freedom,” he said.

One of the most prominent is the ability of the cryptocurrency to continue blasting through important resistance points. The Points To Beat Bitcoin remains the most valuable asset in the crypto space currently. This is due to its outperformance over the course of its existence. But this has not come without its hurdles, some of which are major resistance points that the asset must comfortably break through to establish the start of a bull trend.

The single, “Don’t Forget My Love,” will have its royalty rights embedded in what the platform calls “Limited Digital Assets (LDA),” which are essentially Polygon-based non-fungible tokens (NFT).  The platform is one of the many crypto-based projects looking to shake up the music industry, turning to blockchain and NFTs as a way to loosen the grip of major record labels.  “Diplo is a cultural leader and innovator who always pushes boundaries. We’re incredibly stoked that his fans will have the opportunity to own a piece of his music,” Royal founder and fellow DJ Justin Blau told CoinDesk in a statement. “This drop shows there’s a real, mainstream application for blockchain technology, and the use cases extend beyond independent artists and enthusiast communities.”  Read more: Nas Selling Rights to Two Songs via Crypto Music Startup Royal  Royal will sell the collection of 2,110 Diplo LDA tokens on March 29. The token’s three tiers correspond to different percentages of ownership, with the cheapest, $99 token giving its owner 0.004% of the song’s streaming royalties and the most expensive, $9,999 tier giving 0.7%.  Royal’s first major artist collaboration was with the famed rapper Nas back in January, who tokenized two songs on the platform after investing in the firm’s $55 million Series A last year.  Royal has since collaborated with artists Ollie and Verite, with all three collections selling out, so far totaling 413 ether (around $1.2 million) of trade volume on secondary marketplace OpenSea.  Of the three collections, Nas’s remains the most popular, with the lowest tier holding onto a 0.182 ETH (roughly $546) floor price at the time of writing. The tokens were initially sold for $99.

42394264,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvaouJ,1648140697,Making MakerDAO Matter Again,"During the “DeFi Summer” bull market of 2020 that propelled this nascent corner of the cryptocurrency industry from the blockchain backwaters to a multibillion-dollar opportunity, DeFi Pulse’s “Maker dominance” widget began to seem a bit like an anachronism.  The tool was simple, provided by decentralized finance’s premier data provider. It was a way to track the total percentage of capital allocated to MakerDAO, the issuer of the DAI stablecoin that’s managed by a group of stakeholders, compared to all other decentralized finance protocols – the lenders, the exchanges, the yield generators.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  At the time DeFi Pulse launched in early 2019, it made sense to measure Maker’s “dominance,” DeFi Pulse founder Scott Lewis said. The stablecoin project was first theorized in 2014 by founder Rune Christensen, released in 2017 and had already garnered “product-market fit,” something of a rarity for any crypto project.  Maker offered a way for people to essentially print their own U.S. dollar-denominated tokens, DAI, in exchange over-collateralized ETH deposits – all without a middleman. That meant crypto users had access to tokenized greenbacks without having to deal with centralized companies or consortia like Tether or Circle.  It was a potentially huge market, and Maker was essentially profitable from the jump. By 2019, people were comfortable minting $1 million dollar loans on MakerDAO. Its smart contracts attracted hundreds of millions worth of currency. It was the gold star DeFi project.  Compound was the first DeFi protocol to “flip” MakerDAO. It had just issued a governance token, COMP, to give control over the protocol to its users, kick-starting a trend of DeFi tools issuing tokens and garnering previously untold numbers of users.  Today, Maker’s dominance stands around 20% of the DeFi market, as measured by DeFi Pulse. Of course, “dominance” in DeFi is not zero-sum – the entire industry has grown significantly – worth some $80 billion in total, down from an all-time high of around $110 billion in November – with MakerDAO alongside it.  But the stablecoin project is facing steep competition. Terra, an all-in-one layer 1, or base, blockchain that offers its own DeFi ecosystem, is built around its own “decentralized” stablecoin, UST. According to CoinGecko, there are some $15.9 billion USTs – making it the fourth-largest stablecoin behind tether (USDT), USDC and Binance's stablecoin (BUSD) – compared to $9 billion DAI.  See also: Most Influential 2021: Do Kwon  This state of affairs has some wondering about Maker’s future. Last week, five prominent MakerDAO members submitted a governance proposal outlining an “Aggressive Growth Strategy” for Maker where the platform would expand into “real world assets.” The Defiant did a great write-up of the specifics involved.  Today, Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capitalist firm with massive stakes across crypto, including in Maker, proposed adding “functionality to the MKR token” to make it a more attractive investment and protocol.  The details of each are worth looking into if you’re interested (it’s above my head, to be honest), but in short both are proposals to expand the range of assets Maker interacts with and the way it manages collateral and fees.  Maker has reinvented itself in the past. In November 2019, the protocol launched “multi-collateral” dai, allowing users to collateralize additional assets including Basic Attention Token (BAT). Similar functionality for wrapped bitcoin (wBTC) came a few months later.  More recently, the project has been expanding further into the world of traditional finance, allowing users to use real estate to finance loans. In September, French banking giant Société Générale (SG) applied for a $20 million loan in DAI.  Although the project has been beset by governance issues in the past, it still has a committed group of users who want to see DeFi’s once-dominant platform take on a little more of the world. Then again, it never really went anywhere.  “Seems people still like using it,” DeFi Pulse’s Lewis said.

42417129,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcSJwR3,1648139137,Why the Bitcoin Mining Debate Is So Dysfunctional,"The original Bitcoin client didn’t discriminate between nodes, wallets or miners. Rather, an early adopter would download the Bitcoin software, sync to the tip of the young blockchain, create a wallet and start streaming mining rewards to themselves.  Bitcoin is different today. Only “dedicated” bitcoiners run nodes. Custodial wallets are built into every fintech app imaginable. And mining is industrialized and mainstream, known for its energy intensity and political divisiveness.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Mining Week  Unfortunately, much of the current dialogue around Bitcoin mirrors the protocol it interacts with: in bits and pieces. Companies building nodes tell you to run a node. Wallet builders shout “not your keys, not your coins!” And miners talk about “non-KYC sats."" Each is in it for themselves, and consequently, fights their battles alone.  Of course, there’s more to Bitcoin than the three stated parts. Exchanges, mixers and block explorers are but a few new domains within the Bitcoin industry that didn’t exist in 2009. This specialization is likely a net benefit, but also holds downsides, particularly for an industry already within the regulatory crosshairs. An attack on one part, say proof-of-work (PoW) mining, will bleed into other areas of Bitcoin, such as privacy.  More directly, specialization leads to fragmentation and isolation, two outcomes Bitcoin must stay away from if it’s to survive another 10 years. Two examples – the ESG (environmental, social and governance)-led anti-bitcoin mining campaign and Bitcoin’s long entanglement with privacy concerns – are prescient.  On the surface, green bitcoin mining – wherein newly minted bitcoin created from green energy sells for a premium to ESG-focused investors – could be a boon. Wealth managers stand on the sidelines, anxiously thumbing dollars they’d rather exchange for satoshis. BlackRock holds notable shares in MicroStrategy, Riot and other bitcoin-first firms. Why not widen the pie by encouraging miners to find and utilize green energy?  Small changes are never enough, however. Regulators and investors call for more addendums to a protocol they often have little understanding of, given its novelty. Take celebrity investor Kevin O’Leary recent appearance on CoinDesk TV, calling for the widespread adoption of hydroelectric power over the mixed energy sources used by the Bitcoin network today. He further “dumped” his mining stocks (to use crypto parlance) after President Joe Biden’s cryptocurrency executive order, saying in another interview “that these [bitcoin mining] companies can't cut it.”  Read more: How Does Bitcoin Mining Work?  “There's no way they can prove they're not using carbon – bad news,"" O’Leary (aka “Mr. Wonderful”) said.  Bitcoin mixing service Wasabi Wallet serves as another example. Wasabi Wallet, a means for breaking ownership links between bitcoin holders and their identity, shot itself in the foot last week by announcing a preemptive policy to block certain UTXOs (read bitcoins) from interacting with the protocol.  “We are trying to protect the company and the project by minimizing the amount of these hackers and scammers using the coordinator and getting us in trouble,” Wasabi developer Rafe explained in a tweet. “This should be in the rights of the company to do but believe me, none of us are happy about this.”  Privacy-focused bitcoiners cried foul. How could a company building around non-state money fall to statist head fakes?  Bitcoin miners and privacy advocates alike have been relegated to fighting these important battles alone. Miners have resorted to hiring content teams, public relations firms and aggressive marketing strategies to turn public opinion. Privacy advocates have fought on Twitter and GitHub, such as the long-standing dispute between Wasabi Wallet and Samourai Wallet that came to a head last week, with little interest from those in other circles.  Read more: Why Do Old-Line Businesses Enter Crypto Mining? Simple: Fat Profits  There’s a difference between the human community of “bitcoiners” and the protocol itself. Bitcoin interacts seamlessly: Nodes keep the consensus rules, wallets self-custody funds, and miners secure the network. It can’t be said the same is true for those building, using and running Bitcoin infrastructure. Node builders care about nodes, and the same holds for wallet providers and miners.  Bitcoin is not a monolith. Rather, it's a multi-legged stool with each leg constantly demanding support from its peers. If Bitcoin is to take the next 10 years onward, bitcoiners should note Bitcoin’s original design and begin listening to every conversation, not just the ones they specialize in.

42407278,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVUNA8,1648138636,Why Crypto Mining Actually Matters,"Proof-of-work? Proof-of-stake? A hybrid? One of the new algorithms like proof-of-history or Snowball that next-generation coins like Solana and Avalanche bring to the table?  Over the years, we've seen fierce debates in the crypto community over the best mining solution. “It's proof-of-work or death! Satoshi's original computing power race is the one true way.”  “No, you fool, proof-of-stake delivers 1000 times energy efficiency and it's much faster.”  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Mining Week.  “But proof-of-stake is government by plutocracy and that's horrible and must be stopped now!”  Perhaps the strangest thing about these debates is that the folks shouting the loudest often have no idea what they're talking about.  They're not mathematicians or computer science researchers who understand the inner workings of the algorithms and the trade-offs that each one brings. They pick their favorite coin the way they pick their favorite sports team and then hold onto it with fanatical determination. It's safe to say we shouldn't take most of these uninformed opinions all that seriously when it's not much better than saying the Yankees are better than the Red Sox.  Even calling them ""mining"" solutions is a bit of a misnomer. Bitcoin created a solution that algorithmically mimicked gold mining and we've been calling consensus mechanisms mining ever since. Most of them don't mimic mining, and even mining itself is a poor term for what's happening under the hood.  The impact of decentralized truth machines will change society in countless ways  Bitcoin's mining system mints new coins, secures the network, decides on the order of transactions, processes transactions and more. It's like calling the Visa (V) network ""credit cards"" when plastic credit cards are only one tiny aspect of what Visa does to move money around the world.  Even worse, what gets lost in these ideological battles is what makes blockchains useful in the first place. Blockchains are not interesting because of proof-of-work or proof-of-stake. That’s just a means to an end. Mining and proof-of-stake and every other innovative new blockchain, with some fancy new mechanism to make chains faster or more scalable, are really just variations on how we get to consensus.  The true genius of blockchains is something simpler and more fundamental.  Back in 2015, The Economist called blockchains “trust machines.” You can trust the results without having to rely on the third party that enforces the rules and holds bad actors to account the way we rely on Visa to fight fraud for us and roll back transactions when someone steals our card. That's a good take, but it's not the whole story. Trust is powerful, but it's not the real power of the blockchains.  Read more: Bitcoin Mining and ESG: A Match Made in Heaven  The real power of blockchains is truth.  Blockchains are truth machines.  But not just any truth. Blockchains are engines of decentralized truth.  Objective truth and the state of the world  To be clear, we're not talking objective truth here, as in ""all men must die."" That's a philosophical rabbit hole anyway. We're talking about answering the question, ""What's true for this system?""  If we mean Bitcoin, then “what's true for this system” means where is all the money right now? Where was it yesterday? Which wallet owns what? And so on.  Blockchains give us a way for people to answer questions like: What's the state of the world? How do I know? How can I prove it? How can someone else prove it?  Even better, they give us a constantly updating truth instead of a static truth. We know the state of the world right now and where it was a month ago and a year ago. Each new block is a point in time snapshot of where we are and every block before it is a history of where we were. They're a way for us to decide on consensus reality across a distributed system.  Of course, there are lots of ways to agree on objective truth across a distributed environment. Some of them are a lot faster. Create a centralized database managed by a trusted third party and you've got the power to manage state (the set of stored data) across a vast and distributed system by acting as the final arbiter of truth.  That's what Git is in the software universe. Git lets developers all across the world work on the same code and merge it together and resolve disputes if two people check in different versions of the code (i.e. ,upload them to a repository for review). It was created by legendary software developer Linus Torvalds to make working on Linux easier; Torvalds needed a way to get all those distributed developers to agree on which branch of code reigned supreme.  Democracy is another example. In a nation-state of hundreds of millions of people, it's hard to get everyone to agree, and so we elect representatives to argue about things and hash out all the details of what laws to make and what we do next and why. It's slow, messy and sometimes ugly, but as long as everyone plays by the rules, it works to establish consensus. The representatives debate, a law gets passed, a policy gets changed, and we move forward even if it happens slowly, with a few steps forward and one step back or five steps back and one step forward.  But what if someone doesn't want to play by the rules? What if they want to break the system? They seize power and start tearing apart democratic institutions and rewriting the rules so that they always win. They find the exploits and overthrow that democracy with an insurrection or a military junta, like we just saw in Myanmar and throughout history in places like Japan during World War II.  How do you come to a consensus then?  You don't.  The winner writes the rules and everyone else on the wrong side of those rules suffers.  That's the problem with centralized authority. It's fast, elegant and simple, right up until it isn't. The problem with trusting a third party is that trust is a moving concept: The party can change the rules.  Perhaps you trust a company, like the company that runs your Git instance in the cloud. But what if it starts gating off features that were formerly free? Maybe it suddenly starts charging outrageous fees every time you check in code? What if it starts losing backups and mixing up data?  Is it still trustworthy then?  Or maybe you've got a trust in rule of law and you say you trust the U.S. Department of Justice. But really, which one do you mean? Do you mean the Department of Justice during the Warren Harding administration where the attorney general profited off prohibition and sold pardons to the highest bidder, or do you mean the Department of Justice that aggressively prosecuted the Ku Klux Klan and dramatically reduced violence across the South in the 1870s?  There is no Department of Justice as such; there are only the people running it at the time.  Read more: What Is Cryptojacking? How to Protect Yourself Against Crypto Mining Malware  And that's the real problem with centralized consensus. If the people behind it change, you can't really trust it anymore. A once-trusted institution is now broken and the rules are changed on you. If they tell you the new truth is 1+1 = 3, then that's the new truth and there is nothing you can do about it.  Even worse, how do you reach consensus across the entire world, a world filled with dramatically different ideologies, philosophies and objectives? You have everything from autocracies, to communist state-capitalists, to free-wheeling capitalist democracies, to European socialist systems and everything in between. You have the far Left and the far Right. You have people who can't agree on the color of the sky, much less a policy on abortion or guns or vaccines. How do you come to an understanding then?  The real world is fraught with different desires, wants and needs, and it's all clouded by hatred, prejudices, ignorance and stupidity at multiple levels. How do you get that broad spectrum of incompatible ideologies to decide on consensus reality? How do you get two rival companies to agree when they're fighting over the same market? What about two hostile nation-states or nations in a shooting war? How do you make sure nobody rips up the rules and takes over the system for themselves and forces everyone to agree that 1 + 1 = 3?  Before blockchains, the answer was, you can't.  When someone or some group manages to seize power from everyone else and impose their will, everything falls apart. There's no way to stop it. They take over, delete the database, rewrite the rules and everyone plays by those rules and there's no choice. If it's a company, as a consumer you might move on. But if it’s a nation-state, you might find yourself stuck unless you can move to another nation-state and that's no easy task for even the most intrepid among us.  Where blockchains really thrive is in chaos. They're a decentralized truth machine in hostile environments.  They let us agree on a ground truth whether we're friends, or frenemies, or outright enemies. People can hate each other, want to kill each other, not agree on anything and still reach a consensus truth together. We don't have to trust a third party to tell us what the truth is: We can look at the chain and see for ourselves.  We can agree, even when we all disagree.  We've never had that in history before now.  And what that means for the world is something we're only beginning to understand.  The great blockchains of truth  At the present time, we've used these powerful technologies only as a way to create decentralized monetary systems. That's no small feat, but it's only a small fraction of what they can really do for the world.  Over the next 100 years, blockchains will play an increasing role as invisible arbiters of truth across hostile systems.  Even better, we'll be able to build chains of truth that outlast lifetimes and hostile takeovers and regime changes.  When it comes to monetary systems, we'll see the rise of international digital monetary systems, where the consensus rules are defined by a hybrid of people and algorithmic consensus.  Imagine a monetary policy that could easily take into account inflation as its governing algorithms consult oracles and then adjust interest rates and money supply, all without ever needing an old man in a suit to change a policy three months later when it's already too late. Imagine a monetary supply where 50 or 100 countries use it and all have a stake in the rules. If they go to war, they can still count on the money to be good instead of collapsing when their country collapses, as has happened hundreds of times throughout history.  Every country will become a local node in the system and when one of those nodes goes crazy or rogue it won't corrupt the whole system. That means when a local dictator, who thinks he's above the laws of supply and demand, tries to cut interest rates to stop inflation and instead creates runaway inflation, the local people won't lose their life's fortunes because he won't be able to make those changes.  Beyond money, we'll start to see blockchains become the ultimate arbiter of truth in dozens of other systems.  What gets lost in these ideological battles is what makes blockchains useful in the first place.  Take property disputes. We'll see international chains that show who owns what and how that ownership changes hands over time. Everything from who owns what cars and houses to smaller items like bikes and computers and cellphones. At this time, property ledgers are a tangled mess run at the local level of the state, and they cover only big-ticket items like houses because it's too costly and crazy to try to capture anything else.  But in the future, when you buy a bike online it will register you as the owner to a distributed world chain that keeps track of it all. When someone steals that bike and the police pick it up, they'll know who owns that bike and be able to return it to its rightful owner.  Those international property chains will also let people become fractional owners of all kinds of smaller pieces of property. Maybe you'll own a small fraction of a local coffee shop you love, buying its shares right from your phone. Or, you might go in on an apartment building with a few thousand other owners, making small dividends on rents that come in over time. You might own a piece of art with 20 other people, like an NFT (non-fungible token) that conveys actual ownership rights, and when it changes hands you'll automatically get a notification to vote on where that art can be displayed because the new owner requested an update to the rules from the ownership collective.  Those property ledgers will outlive political regimes, too. When the Communists took over China, they ripped up centuries of old property titles, massacred the landlords and made the government the sole owner of all property. Owners found their family's house deed worth less than toilet paper. But regimes don't last forever and a property ledger that survives even when someone rips up the rules would allow recompense when that regime inevitably collapses later on in history. Families from centuries past might find themselves able to claim back land they once owned or get paid compensation after a new, more friendly government returns to power.  We'll see all that because transparent ownership databases almost always lead to secondary markets. The first companies of merchant kings figured out how to distribute risk with shares in the 1600s and 1700s, and it wasn't long after that secondary markets developed where people could buy and sell the shares of those powerful companies.  Read more: Why Do Old-Line Businesses Enter Crypto Mining? Simple: Fat Profits  Today we take it for granted when it comes to buying and selling shares in companies on stock exchanges, despite us having no connection to the owners or inside knowledge of the business. Property chains will open up brand-new secondary markets and take the idea of a stock exchange to an exponential new level.  We'll also bring blockchains to bear on activities like voting. We've already had decades of research into end-to-end auditable voting systems that cryptographically ensure no votes are tampered with or changed. We'll see blockchains become the decentralized audit database for those kinds of systems where every single vote is recorded perfectly and even when people shout about massive fraud, they'll either be able to prove it or not based on a transparent record that nobody can alter.  Blockchains will also play a critical role in evaluating the authenticity of voice and video recordings, as artificial intelligence destroys our ability to trust what we're seeing with deep fakes that are indistinguishable from the real thing. As deep fakes become more and more common, they will make video evidence in court become worthless. The only way out is to have cameras record live streaming, hashed authentications to blockchains as they film. Only the videos that have block stamps will be admissible as evidence and everything else will be suspect.  The impact of decentralized truth machines will change society in countless ways.  And that can't come fast enough.  Because in today's world, truth is breaking down fast.  Bringing Back the Truth  On social media, we're drowning in a sea of voices. In an era where even fringe lunatics can make their voice heard, often by shouting louder than everyone else, it's hard to hear the real signal through the noise.  We live in an era of perpetual information warfare. People prove their beliefs with bizarre, insane ""facts"" that make no sense to anyone but themselves. Or they don't bother trying to prove anything at all. Instead they just outright deny reality and create their own reality. Today you can tell someone the sky is blue and, if they're your political enemy, they'll tell you it's red and you're a hideous liar for trying to convince them otherwise.  The centralized citadels of truth have broken down. We don't trust institutions, politicians, companies, newspapers, media, authority figures, scientists or world leaders. Everyone is suspect. Everyone seems to be behind a wider conspiracy to defraud us all.  Of course, there are objective truths. You're free to believe gravity doesn't exist, but go jump out of a 100-story window and you'll find you were wrong and gravity has a 100% win record at that height.  The problem is not the truth doesn't exist; it's that we just can't see it anymore. As every third-party trust breaks down, we need a new system we can trust. We need an independent, open, decentralized system that records the truth of the system faithfully and consistently, every single second of every day, an unbreakable chain of truth.  It’s time to stop thinking of mining as just a way to mint glorified Chuck E Cheese coins. Proof-of-work, proof-of-stake and proof-of-history are much, much more. Mining is the way to that unbreakable chain of truth more than anything else. Mining decides on how the system flows and how it’s ordered. It gives us the state of reality that we all agree on.  Read more: How Does Bitcoin Mining Work?  And in a world where dictators and authoritarians and would-be authoritarians want to have ultimate power to ram their made-up truth and fake reality down our throats, it’s never been more important for us to have a way to establish consensus reality across a system filled with hostile forces. They are how we come to decide on what the truth is together.  The good news is that hope is on the horizon. Over the next 100 years, we won't need to trust an endless stream of charlatans, dictators, information warriors, idiots, fools and reality deniers.  We'll just turn our eyes to the chain and we'll know the real truth once again.

42435231,wOc5H8d0GcW5NDeNpBuMcj,1648135350,"Next 24 Hours Crucial for EU Crypto Law as Officials Debate Emissions, DeFi, NFTs","The next 24 hours could prove crucial in determining how the European Union (EU) will regulate cryptocurrencies.  As the European Parliament moves towards finalizing its position on Europe’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework, the EU Council, made up of government ministers and other officials from member countries, will meet Friday to discuss how to treat non-fungible tokens (NFT), decentralized finance (DeFi) and the environmental impact of bitcoin-style assets.  UPDATE (March 25th, 11:36 UTC): EU's MiCA Bill Moves Forward Without Bitcoin Limiting Provision  The EU’s landmark MiCA regulation seeks to offer a single license for crypto providers to operate across the bloc’s 27 member countries, in exchange for measures intended to protect investors and safeguard stability.  But it will only pass into law if governments and lawmakers agree on an identical document, and there are several issues to be ironed out first.  First, the European Parliament needs to figure out how – and in particular whether it wants – to limit the use of proof-of-work methods used to validate bitcoin (BTC), a process which some worry consumes too much energy.  A report penned by EU parliamentarian Stefan Berger has already said that initial coin offerings should inform investors of the environmental damage in the “white paper” they must publish under MiCA – and Berger now seems confident there won’t be a mutiny from other lawmakers seeking more heavy-handed measures that could amount to a bitcoin ban.  “The deadline to challenge my trilogue mandate runs out at midnight,” he tweeted in German Thursday morning. “So far everything seems calm.”  Friday morning, the EU Council will meet behind closed doors to hammer out how Berger’s views differ from their own – and France’s officials seem relatively optimistic they can find common ground.  “The texts of the European Parliament and the Council converge to a great extent on the framework applicable” to the large-scale currency tokens that are most heavily regulated by the new law, said a document seen by CoinDesk, prepared by French officials ahead of that meeting.  In a position set out in November, ministers sought tight curbs on any attempt to issue assets that could be widely used as an alternative to regular fiat currency – a move likely targeted at the now-canceled Diem stablecoin project supported by Facebook (now Meta) and other industry players.  There may well still be squabbles over the exact roles of regulators like the European Banking Authority, the European Securities and Markets Authority and their national equivalents, said the French document. France currently chairs talks within the Council.  But there may also be disagreements over how to deal with innovations in a field that moves faster than lawmakers can.  DeFi has seen a surge recently, and some EU lawmakers have pushed to allow decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) to issue new cryptocurrencies – something that wasn’t even on the agenda earlier when the MiCA law was first discussed.  “Member States might wish to discuss this issue again,” according to the French document, because DeFi “was still in full development at the time of negotiations.”  The framework also isn’t intended to cover non-fungible tokens (NFT) that can be used to prove ownership of assets like artworks. But, France concedes, if NFTs grant a right to a share of profits similar to conventional securities, they could be made subject to existing financial service laws on investor information and against market abuse.  But France also seems keen not to pile extra anti-money laundering (AML) rules on crypto service providers – suggesting those should be dealt with a separate, more general review of dirty-money laws that is now ongoing.  In February, leading members of the European Parliament proposed a blueprint for AML rules that would apply identity checks to all crypto transactions, even those worth under 1,000 euros.

The two expect the change to be finalized sometime between November of this year and May of 2023.

42410888,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggt373,1648132664,‘Correctly’ Was Wrong: Circle’s Accountant Tweaks Fine Print of USDC Attestation,"A one-word change in Circle’s attestation reports for the USDC stablecoin may be more significant than it first appears, according to accounting experts who spoke to CoinDesk.  As early as its first publicly available attestation, for October 2018 but issued the following month, Circle’s independent accountants, Grant Thornton LLP, wrote that the reserve accounts were “correctly stated” as of midnight at the end of the previous month. These accounts hold the real-world U.S. dollars backing USDC, a token that runs on the Ethereum blockchain and almost always trades for close to $1.  CoinDesk discovered a change with the most recent report, for the month of January 2022, when Grant Thornton began using the phrase “fairly stated” rather than “correctly stated.”  The term “correctly stated” appeared three times in each of the 25 monthly reports signed by the accounting firm from October 2018 through December of last year. It was also found in each “Reserve Account Report” signed by Circle’s chief financial officer, Naeem Ishaq, that was attached to Grant Thornton’s reports fromApril 2019 to July 2019 and in December 2019.  From the January 2020 to the April 2021 report, Circle’s vice president of accounting and finance, Timothy Singh, used the term a few times as well. With the May 2021 report (signed in July 2021), Singh dropped “correctly stated,” even while Grant Thornton continued to use the term.  The episode shows that investors holding stablecoins are putting a lot of trust in the issuer, even when it provides an attestation from a global accounting firm – because the accountant isn't supposed to swear on it.  According to a spokesperson for Circle (which is getting ready to go public at a $9 billion valuation), the tweak was made in preparation for an upcoming change to accounting standards.  “Grant Thornton updated the report language with their adoption of SSAE 21, which is effective June 15, 2022. Prior and current attestation reports comply with the applicable professional standards,"" the Circle spokesperson said.  Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAEs) are issued by the Association of International Certified Professional Accountants (AICPA). SSAE 21 covers “direct examination engagements.”  Meanwhile, Grant Thornton spokesperson Jon Rucket said, “as a matter of policy, we cannot share client work products with third parties,” and told CoinDesk to reach out to Circle directly.  Stablecoins serve as critical plumbing for the $1.9 trillion global cryptocurrency market. Traders use these synthetic dollars to quickly transfer value in and out of exchanges to capitalize on arbitrage opportunities. USDC is the second-largest stablecoin, with $52.3 billion outstanding, behind Tether’s USDT, which has $80.8 billion.  Because USDC’s value is based on a promise to redeem them at any time for greenbacks, investors rely on the monthly reserve attestations from Grant Thornton for reassurance that Circle is good for the money.  As such, any change in the fine print merits scrutiny.  Why the change matters  So, what’s the big deal with an adverb?  One thing that seems to perplex the accounting mavens CoinDesk contacted was why the term “correctly stated” was even used to begin with. That’s because the term isn’t something usually found in attestations.  An attestation is done by a certified public accountant (CPA), who is hired to issue a report on the examination, review or performance of a set of agreed-upon procedures. For a stablecoin, that could include collecting reports that the issuer provides the accountant showing the collateral matches the market value of the stablecoins circulating on a specific date, but not necessarily verifying or providing an opinion on the information.  This differs from an audit, which is more thorough in that it analyzes and tests the transactions that make up balances on all financial statements over a period of time or at a point in time, and the CPA issues an opinion on whether the balances have been prepared according to standards and are free of material misstatement or error. Large stablecoin issuers such as Circle and Tether provide attestations, not audits.  “Most auditors and attestors do not use the word ‘correct,’ and it would only be used where a precise measurement is available,” said Michael Shaub, an accounting professor at Texas A&M University’s Mays Business School. “I assume crypto is an example of where precise measurement is possible. I am just guessing, but I assume GT [Grant Thornton] was not comfortable going forward with saying it was correct because it no longer matched Circle’s language, the party making the assertion.”  Other accounting professors, however, see the use of “correct” as an egregious error.  “I just have a hard time believing that GT knowingly released a report using the term ‘correctly stated’ while saying that the standards require that they plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance,” said Stephani Mason, assistant professor of accounting at DePaul University, in an email. “I have a hard time with it, not because GT could not make an error, but because the use of the term ‘correctly stated’ instead of ‘fairly stated’ is such a glaring thing that undergrad audit students would know better.”  Mason then went on to note that neither the previous standards nor the new ones cited by Circle’s spokesperson uses the word “correctly.” Each does talk about “reasonable assurance,” which the AICPA defines as “a high, but not absolute, level of assurance.” Those standards use the term “fairly stated,” not “correctly stated,” Mason noted.  Indeed, Grant Thornton said in the USDC attestations that it would try to obtain “reasonable assurance,” but only now is saying “fairly stated” rather than the less equivocal-sounding “correctly stated.”  “I don’t think there is a practical difference intended, but there is the potential to be held to a higher legal standard if you say something is correct rather than simply saying it is fair (as in not materially misstated),” said Texas A&M’s Shaub in an email. The AICPA’s “AT-C 205, which covers examinations (The report says, ‘We have examined . . . .’) never uses the word ‘correct’ as an option, only ‘fairly stated.’”  “I don’t think GT is going to get in trouble for saying ‘correct,’” Shaub added. “But I wouldn’t say it. Legally, I think it’s whether you can convince a jury there is a substantive difference, particularly since standards don’t forbid using the term ‘correct.’ But it’s hard to say they didn’t follow standards if the standards provide for language other than ‘fairly stated, based on the criteria,’ which they used in January 2022. I could argue that ‘in accordance with’ means ‘correct in accordance with.’ But I’m not an attorney to know if that’s a winning argument.”  The episode shows that investors holding stablecoins are putting a lot of trust in the issuer, even when it provides an attestation from a global accounting firm – because the accountant isn't supposed to swear on it.  “In the end, whatever happened it is not a good look for [Grant Thornton],” said Francine McKenna, a forensic accountant and incoming professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. “They either agreed to provide absolute assurance with the word ‘correctly’ – insane! – or allowed/found out Circle changed the word, or made the mistake themselves for two years.

42417128,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcSJwQ1,1648131179,What’s at Stake as Josh Jarrett Sues the IRS,"On Feb. 3, 2022, Josh Jarrett, a Tennessee “smartgym” owner and a “baker” (who ensures transactions in a block are correct) on the Tezos blockchain, announced he was rejecting the U.S. government's offer of a $4,000 tax refund for income taxes he paid on his cryptocurrency staking rewards. The offered refund was an attempt by the government to settle a lawsuit Josh brought against the Internal Revenue Service in May 2021. Declining the refund, Josh decided to push forward with his lawsuit.  In looking for clarity about his own tax bills, Jarrett might provide much needed clarity for the staking industry. The Internal Revenue Service has not been clear if staking rewards – the tokens generated from securing a proof-of-stake (POS) blockchain – should be treated as income or property, an important classification for accounting purposes. We at the Proof of Stake Alliance (POSA), see this as an issue of public importance, given staking’s growing role in the larger crypto industry.  This article is part of ""Mining Week.""  The government, in offering a refund on taxes Jarrett paid on his XTZ rewards, attempted to settle his lawsuit. Jarrett is intent on taking the dispute to trial, which might set landmark policy for the crypto industry, as POS becomes the dominant consensus mechanism securing cryptocurrency.  Read more:IRS Offers Tezos Staker Refund on Rewards Tax in Break From Current Policy  The government has since asked the court to dismiss Jarrett’s lawsuit, arguing the offered refund resolves any dispute between the parties. But Jarrett disagrees. In a brief filed last week, Jarrett reiterated the public importance of this case and the need for it to continue. Coin Center also recently filed an amicus (friend of the court) brief in the case, arguing that “by attempting to moot this important case, the IRS is increasing uncertainty for thousands if not millions of already confused taxpayers.”  While the offered refund, motion to dismiss and Jarrett's refusal are certainly noteworthy procedural developments, it’s important to highlight what actually matters in this case: Josh’s position – that staking rewards should be taxed at the time they are sold, not the time they are created. This is the correct legal and policy position for the tax treatment of staking rewards. Though the particular case may not set legal precedent that could impact all stakers, the legal and policy arguments made should serve as a clarion call for the industry.  U.S.-based blockchain innovators are hampered by uncertain tax policy, a fact that will remain true until the court confirms and regulators adopt a saner/consistent position regarding the status of staking rewards.  Jarrett argues in his lawsuit that staking rewards, created by the staker at the time of validating transactions, should be taxed consistent with more than 100 years of tax law. That is, at the time of sale rather than the moment of creation.  When individuals bake loaves of bread, paint works of art, extract oil from a well or gold from a mine, they never pay taxes on the value of the item at the time the property is created, but when they realize income from its sale.  There are a few good reasons why this makes sense: It streamlines the process for paying taxes, lessens the administrative burden on both the taxpayer and the government and is ultimately most equitable. Paying taxes on assets when sold is not tax avoidance. Without this treatment, some stakers would have taxable events every few seconds.  Besides, if staking rewards are treated as income, who issues the 1099 form? Whose expense is it? Are blockchains employers?  Instead of acknowledging this as the appropriate legal treatment, the government first ignored Jarrett’s claim for a refund, then opposed his claims in court and offered him a refund and asked the court to dismiss the suit. The government’s recent call to dismiss Jarrett’s lawsuit represents one of two things:  1) recognition that Jarrett’s legal position regarding staking rewards is correct  2) an attempt to prevent the court from resolving the question at the center of Josh’s case: How should his staking rewards be taxed?  If it’s the former, then it is hoped clear guidance from the IRS will be forthcoming. Assuming it’s the latter, however, this would be another unfortunate instance of the IRS doing everything in its power to prevent the court from ruling and weighing in on fair and appropriate tax policy for a growing part of our economy.  Read more: US Tax Agency Moves to Dismiss Lawsuit by Tezos Stakers Who Refused Refund, Demanded Trial  While the IRS has failed to act on staking rewards, the world has continued to move to blockchain and blockchain has started to shift to proof-of-stake. Staking is already a multibillion-dollar industry and America is home to some of the largest and fastest-growing players in the staking ecosystem. Staking is also performed by individuals throughout the U.S., including Josh Jarrett, who help secure the protocols they participate in and get exposure to the upside of these protocols through staking rewards. Many of the largest U.S-based crypto exchanges have also started facilitating staking for their retail customers, bringing staking to millions more individuals and making the country an integral part of securing proof-of-stake blockchains.  The Proof of Stake Alliance (POSA), along with prominent crypto advocates and tax law experts, are spotlighting Jarrett’s case because it highlights the foundational principles of blockchain innovation: crypto – or digital assets – are digital property.  Or as Coin Center so aptly put it, “Starving taxpayers of clear policy statements while simultaneously expanding enforcement of unclear rules will erode taxpayer faith in the rule of law, reduce tax compliance and tax revenue because of the costs inherent in determining a correct approach, and subject thousands of taxpayers to potential criminal liability without reasonable attempts to make them aware of those liabilities and how they can be avoided.""  Without unequivocal confirmation that staking rewards are taxed like all other created property, America could lose its foothold as a home for a growing staking ecosystem, which drives blockchain innovation and job creation. It’s time for the courts, Congress or the IRS to make clear that staking rewards should receive the same tax treatment as any other type of created property. There’s a lot more at stake than Josh Jarrett’s tax refund.",NEUTRAL,XTZ,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | REGULATION | XTZ,"Alison Mangiero, Evan Weiss",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/03/24/whats-at-stake-as-josh-jarrett-sues-the-irs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7002e6e735e4531f9b720cbae0611ca70ead4ccc-1365x2048.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The rest of the NFTs will be sold at lower price points starting at $75, in a move that the club hopes will keep the digital collectibles accessible for its broader fan base, a representative told CoinDesk.  The partnership is just the latest get for Sotheby’s growing Web 3 arm.

Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoin's post-Fed rally stalls despite persistent rumors of big BTC purchases by the Luna Foundation Guard. Cardano and dogecoin rally.

Harold Bossé, vice president of new product and innovation and cross-border payment innovation at Mastercard.  Alexander Zhang, mayor, Friends With Benefits  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  The upward momentum in bitcoin and ether stalled, with ether facing rejection near the $3,100 mark.  Rumors of the Luna Foundation Guard following through on its plans to buy $3 billion worth of bitcoin to introduce a new BTC-backed reserve UST stablecoin continued to make the rounds.  ""There's probably $3-$7 billion in bidding coming on the back of @stablekwon's buying of a couple billion. It shouldn't be taken lightly how enormous, known spot buys are,"" Split Capital's Zaheer Ebtikar tweeted during the Asian trading hours on Thursday.  Bitcoin's implied volatility continued to slide, extending its post-Federal Reserve meeting slide and signaling a persistent bias to sell options (vols). Meanwhile, put-call skews continued to show a preference for puts or options offering downside protection with above-zero prints.  In alternative cryptocurrencies, the meme cryptocurrency dogecoin and Cardano's ADA each surged more than 10%. ADA is being backed by increased accumulation by both small and large addresses. ""The addresses by holding indicator show an increasing accumulation across the board in the different brackets. Addresses holding 10-100 and 100k-1m ADA increased their balance by 12% and 11% in 30 days,"" analytics firm IntoTheBlock said in its Telegram channel.  Attendees of the Avalanche Summit reported an overall positive mood, with a few exciting infrastructure developments in the pipeline. ""There is a lot of excitement about NFTs (non-fungible tokens), cross-chain bridges and DeFi (decentralized finance) projects. Institutional investors are well represented. It's common to bump into VCs (venture capitalists) that invested in multiple Ethereum and Solana projects in the past but are new to Avalanche,"" Ilan Solot, a partner at the Tagus Capital Multi-Strategy Fund, said in an email.  In traditional markets, oil prices rose 5% on both sides of the Atlantic early today after Russian President Vladimir demanded unfriendly nations pay for Russian gas in rubles. ""As the EU (European Union) gets around 40% of their gas from Russia, this has huge implications,"" Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at U.K-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, said in an email. ""Rising oil prices increase the likelihood of a recession over the coming year.""  The futures tied to the S&P 500 pointed to a positive open with a 0.23% gain.

""This could be caused by bullish institutional investors and the ongoing rolls from the BTC ETFs (exchange-traded funds), which might cause buying pressure farther dated futures,"" Arcane Research said in a weekly research note published Tuesday.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved ProShares’ Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) and a string of others ETFs investing in the CME-listed bitcoin futures late last year.  The total bitcoin exposure in ProShares ETF trading under the ticker BITO on the New York Stock Exchange rose to a lifetime high above 28,000 BTC on Monday.  Premiums on offshore exchanges have also risen in a sign of improving market sentiment. That said, futures are still drawing less than 10% premium, which indicates that leverage remains low and the recent move higher could be spot-driven.  Analysts remain confident about bitcoin's prospects. ""Tens of thousands of bitcoin being bought [by Luna Foundation Guard] and taken off the market will likely have a significant impact on price over the coming weeks/months,"" GlobalBlock's Sotiriou said. ""Bitcoin bears will have a hard time fighting the buy pressure and in my opinion sellers will get exhausted, leading to a move to the upside above $45k, assuming oil prices do not make new highs.""

42435229,wOc5H8d0GcW5NDeNpBuMNI,1648126849,Cosmos Protocol Archway Raises $21M to Provide Developer Rewards,"Archway is a Cosmos-based protocol that rewards decentralized application (dapp) developers building on the network. On Thursday, Phi Labs, a contributor to Archway, said it raised $21 million in a seed funding round that was co-led by crypto investment firms CoinFund and Hashed.  Phi Labs was spun out of Ignite, formerly known as Tendermint, which launched the Cosmos blockchain-interoperability protocol. Cosmos has grown to have 38 different blockchains, more than 250 projects built on the ecosystem and over $100 billion in digital assets riding atop the network.  The Archway protocol acts as an on-ramp to Cosmos, enabling developers to deploy cross-chain dapps and receive rewards for their contributions to the network.  Read more: Cosmos Builder Tendermint Rebrands to ‘Ignite’ as Team Shifts Focus  “Most layer 1 protocols right now reward validators and miners for performing work for running the actual blockchain. But there’s this whole big ecosystem of participants that are very big contributors to the protocol,” Phi Labs founder Griffin Anderson told CoinDesk in an interview.  “Developers are the most important thing for any layer 1 protocol,” he continued. “They bring users, transactions and activity to the protocol, but they don’t receive any value for their contribution unless they purchase into the protocol token themselves.”  How it works  Archway allocates its native ARCH token to dapps in proportion to the number of users they bring to the network. Developers are free to use those rewards however they want, which means dapps can provide incentives for their own users without dipping into a limited token treasury.  “A dapp developer can build an app on [Archway], and that app can start to earn native network protocol rewards from inflation and gas rewards that are normally burned or go directly to the miners or the validators of the protocol,” Anderson said.  Funding round  Anderson said Phi Labs will use the new capital to build software development tools to make it easier for third-party developers to build on the protocol. Phi Labs will also continue to contribute to Archway.  Other participants in the funding round included Blockchain Capital, Wintermute, Figment, Chorus One, stake.fish, Lemniscap, Hypersphere Ventures and Cosmostation.  “There’s been a proliferation of smart contracting platforms that have hit the market over the last 12 to 18 months,” CoinFund principal Billy Dishman told CoinDesk. “Most of them have focused on different trade-offs around scalability and decentralization. No one has really ideated on the tokenomics.”  Phi Labs, on the other hand, is focused on tokenomics and developer rewards, said Dishman, and “really paying attention to this constituency, which is the lifeblood of any smart contracting platform.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/24/cosmos-protocol-archway-raises-21m-to-provide-developer-rewards,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/45e17b07a4eb5025d6c1e46e05a2e60b5baf35b7-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42435225,wOc5H8d0GcW5NDeNpBuMI9,1648126516,"UK Regulators Say Crypto Adoption Poses Financial Risk, Call for More Oversight","The U.K.’s central bank on Thursday warned that crypto could pose a risk to markets if it continues to grow and called for an expansion of powers to oversee the financial assets.  The London-based regulators worry that international norms could come too late to control financial market risks, and the Bank of England has urged U.K. banks to approach virtual assets with utmost caution.  With a market capitalization worth around 0.4% of the world’s financial assets, crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi) pose a limited risk to financial markets at this time. Regulators, however, are worried that the growth of blockchain technology means that could soon change.  “If the pace of growth seen in recent years continues, and as these assets become more interconnected with the wider financial system, crypto assets and DeFi will present financial stability risks,” according to a report published by the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee (FPC), which is responsible for monitoring stability risks.  “Enhanced regulatory and law enforcement frameworks are needed, both domestically and at a global level,” the report added. It also called on other regulators to ensure that markets don't overheat, to stop financial firms from taking unnecessary risk and to curb scams and market abuse.  Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey on Wednesday called for “high levels” of international collaboration to stop decentralized finance from spiraling out of the authorities’ control. Bailey added that this will take time. In the meantime, U.K. watchdogs appear to be worried about loopholes in the system.  “There is currently scope for regulatory arbitrage, and there is a danger that risks grow rapidly before an internationally agreed framework is in place,” the FPC said.  The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, a global organization, is due to establish rules that would tell banks how careful they need to be when investing in crypto, but appears to be dragging its feet after a first draft met a slew of opposition from financial institutions that said the regulators were being far too cautious.  Sam Woods, CEO of the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), which is responsible for checking the books of individual banks and insurers in the U.K., said in a letter dated Thursday that the PRA is also planning to vet individual crypto exposures in a survey that will take place this year.  “Many of these markets are new and untested,” Woods said, referring to the “extreme volatility and/or limited price history of these [crypto] assets.”  In most cases, banks would have to deduct any digital asset holdings from their capital, as well as plan for specific extra risks like fraud or cyberattacks, he said. This means that, unlike conventional financial assets like mortgages, a banks’ store of crypto cannot be used to vouch for further lending, Woods added.  That warning was echoed by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which is responsible for overseeing traditional finance. Firms should be clear and honest with their clients when selling crypto assets, even though they technically don’t count as financial products and so lie outside of the FCA’s remit, the regulator said on Thursday.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/24/uk-regulators-says-crypto-adoption-poses-financial-risk-call-for-additional-powers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4c4b726d3af0b509f2c9b020eebe1b8b65d6f887-5222x3481.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42435215,wOc5H8d0GcW5NDeNpBuLNY,1648126243,Ukraine Crypto Fundraiser Wants EU to Investigate Whether Binance Is Helping Russia,"The European Union should “investigate” whether the Binance crypto exchange is ""cooperating"" with the Russian government circumvent sanctions imposed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, said Michael Chobanian, founder of Ukraine's Kuna exchange.  “I’m not the court, but [the EU] should investigate,"" said Chobanian, also president of the Blockchain Association of Ukraine and the person managing donations for the Crypto Fund of Ukraine. ""If [Binance is] innocent, I will say [I'm] sorry. If Binance is [not], then they [the EU] will have to deal with it,” Chobanian said in an interview with CoinDesk.  CoinDesk had asked Chobanian whether Ukraine had found proof to support his recent allegation on CoinDesk TV that “Binance is cooperating with Russia” in the context of avoiding sanctions.  At the time, Binance, the biggest crypto exchange by volume, had said, ""We prefer not to comment on false accusations.” In February Binance said it had no plans to unilaterally ban Russian users from the platform but that it would take actions against those who have had sanctions levied against them.  Chobanian argued it is ""obvious we don’t have proof since it is a closed box.”  “Think of Binance as a big bank that can sell you bitcoin (BTC) but instead of buying bitcoin or any other crypto you can top up an account in rubles and then you can change those rubles into U.S. dollars and withdraw in another country without even buying crypto. So it is fiat transaction in, fiat transaction out. It is about guarding the fiat gateways,” Chobanian said.  EU parliamentarian Stefan Berger, the lawmaker responsible for handling the procedure and content of the MiCA (Markets in Crypto Assets) legislative package, told CoinDesk in an earlier interview that “of course, we have clues that some Russians used crypto assets or platforms to circumvent the sanctions.”  Berger made it clear that private persons, not companies, were conducting such actions.  “This is what the [European] commission told us and most of the transactions were made in the last weeks. I have no clue whether it goes any further,” Berger said. He reiterated that this is “why MiCA is so important. It’s a signal that we want to build supervision architecture to start monitoring what happens in Russia.”  Berger was responding to allegations by Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, that crypto service providers may be an “accomplice to” circumventing sanctions against Russia.  Speaking at the Bank for International Settlements’ Innovation Summit on Tuesday, Lagarde said the amount of Russian rubles going into crypto and stablecoins has been on the rise. She reiterated how “critically important” it is to quickly finalize and enforce MiCA.  In his interview with CoinDesk, Chobanian reiterated Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's request to close the airspace over Ukraine as being more effective right now than sanctions.  “My opinion is that the European Union should close the sky or give us more weapons or accept [Ukraine] as a member of NATO. That would be more helpful rather than doing sanctions. Sanctions are something you do when you can’t do something else,” Chobanian said.  Chobanian told CoinDesk that $64.5 million was the latest figure of donations the crypto fund of Ukraine has received.  But as he did on CoinDesk TV, he questioned whether Binance’s promised donation had actually been made.  Binance has promised $10 million to charity and on-ground relief organizations for Ukraine, but Chobanian says that only around $2.5 million has been sent.  “When we started investigating we found it is only $2.5 million. They make $10 million in Russia on a daily basis or hourly, so it is peanuts,” Chobanian said.  He also hinted there could be a Ukraine government non-fungible token coming soon. “There will be a few announcements very soon but I don’t want to spoil the launch. There will be a few things the government is doing and a hint is it will be regarding NFT,” he said.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | BNB,Amitoj Singh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/24/ukraine-crypto-fundraiser-wants-eu-to-investigate-whether-binance-is-helping-russia,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42394268,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvapEp,1648126200,What Does It Mean to Truly Adopt Bitcoin?,"On March 9, U.S. President Joe Biden issued an executive order on digital assets. Commenting on the order, a senior member of the administration stated that some 40 million Americans – 16% of the total U.S. population – have reportedly invested in or are trading crypto.  This official’s statement echoed the results of a report released by Grayscale Research in December 2021, which stated that 26% of Americans own bitcoin (BTC). (Editor’s note: Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk). According to another 2021 survey from bitcoin investment firm NYDIG, 46 million Americans, or nearly a fifth of American adults, own bitcoin.  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Thursday.  In conversations with other professionals in crypto, I’ve heard people use statistics like these to assert that “adoption” of bitcoin in the United States is now above 15%. But in my view, this misses the mark – perhaps by an order of magnitude.  What bitcoin adoption really means  That’s because buying, say, $10 worth of bitcoin is not truly adoption, in my opinion. With bitcoin, adoption means recognizing bitcoin’s role as the world’s best hard-money asset – a monetary asset with a strictly limited supply. It means recognizing bitcoin as the best risk-adjusted and most liquid investment opportunity today. It means realizing that bitcoin is on a path to potentially becoming the world’s most valuable system for value storage and transfer.  Based on such realizations, “adoption” doesn’t mean buying a little bit. It means putting a significant portion of one’s net worth into bitcoin. This definition of adoption isn’t the 16% or more of the population cited by the Biden administration to own at least some crypto, including bitcoin. Instead, it’s the portion of the population that has put 20% or more of its net worth into bitcoin.  Measuring adoption by this standard is difficult. The portion of the U.S. population that has adopted bitcoin accordingly would be smaller – perhaps just 2%. But if bitcoin ultimately reaches its potential as the world’s best hard money asset, then its adoption by this standard could end up exceeding 50% in the long run.  Degrees of adoption  Furthermore, because bitcoin is a monetary asset, its degree of adoption can grow over time along a spectrum for each individual who adopts it. A novice can begin by buying $10 worth and leave it on an exchange, and with time she can shift a greater portion of her savings into bitcoin as she learns about it.  In this respect, it’s different from the process of adoption for most technologies, in which adoption is nearly binary, like the question of owning a car (or maybe two) as opposed to no car, or owning a mobile computing device (or two) as opposed to none. In contrast, bitcoin adoption at the individual level is a sliding scale between dabbling and committing a significant portion of one’s net worth.  What this means for advisors  This has important implications for financial advisors. While you may think that putting 20% of your net worth into bitcoin sounds outlandish, I can tell you it’s already happening. In the last year, I’ve been contacted by numerous financial advisors who are building their businesses around bitcoin. Their clients aren’t allocating 1% of their portfolios to bitcoin – they’re allocating 10% to 30%. For these advisors, the cornerstone of their practice isn’t stocks, bonds, or real estate; it’s bitcoin.  This means that for some financial advisors, bitcoin is already graduating past being the next Amazon (AMZN). It’s now on its way to becoming something more like the next gold or even the next S&P 500 – and possibly the largest asset class in a client’s portfolio. Yet, the fraction of current and potential financial advisory clients who treat it this way is still small enough that it could grow dramatically in size this decade.  As the percentage of the American and global population that has truly adopted bitcoin grows, I expect financial advisors who are on the right side of this trend to reap rich rewards. It isn’t necessary to build a practice around bitcoin – yet – but financial advisors would be wise to find ways to ride the bitcoin adoption wave. It’s just getting started.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Andy Edstrom,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/24/what-does-it-mean-to-truly-adopt-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/537ecaedc4ecfe71c309d46fc140690af769254d-3000x3742.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42421193,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXgIbV,1648126200,How One Russian-Speaking Crypto Company Is Navigating the War in Ukraine,"The Russian invasion of Ukraine cuts across the very human world of digital assets in multiple ways.  Ukrainian authorities and resistance fighters are harnessing the power of cryptocurrencies to fund their defense. Western countries, individual donors and charities are using digital assets to reach Ukrainians in need. Meanwhile, Russians and their financial service providers are eying digital assets amid a collapse in the ruble. And there has been speculation about whether Russian institutions and oligarchs may be also considering cryptocurrencies as a means to shelter or move their assets to evade sanctions.  But in an industry with many founders, workers and users in the former Soviet sphere, the humanitarian impacts run deep, including for PointPay, a Russian-speaking firm that bills itself as the first crypto ecosystem that encompasses a wallet, a bank, an exchange and a payment system but that finds itself cut apart by the battle lines in Ukraine.  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Thursday.  Vladimir Kardapoltsev, who joined PointPay about a year ago and has become its CEO, is a young entrepreneur who got into crypto at the age of 21.  “PointPay was about to complete their IPO stake and I was one of their first big hires to be the chief projects officer, with the first project being overseeing the overhaul of their whole system,” Kardapoltsev said. “I helped grow the company from 15 to about 100 employees, and I was the primary person who was hiring all the people and prioritizing the hires.”  Kardapoltsev was then asked to step in as CEO after a break with his predecessor. Today, he’s concerned with business growth, acquisitions, new hires, strategic leadership and trying to make the company more stable – but the conflict has stymied his company’s promising growth.  Now, Kardapoltsev finds himself navigating PointPay through Europe’s most serious major conflict in decades.  Built on the bloc  “I was the primary person growing the company, which was mainly operating from Russia and Ukraine in the beginning,” Kardapoltsev said. “We outgrew the market in Russia – I’ve interviewed 3,000 people, pretty much every person who has worked in crypto in the Russian-speaking world and all sorts of people in Europe. We’ve looked for people in Kazakhstan, Belarus and Ukraine because not only are salaries slightly lower there than they were in Russia, but there are incredibly good specialists in those countries.”  PointPay is actually based in the Caribbean nation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Kardapoltsev is London-educated and has lived in the U.K. for most of his life, but claims Romanian citizenship and lives in an Eastern European country. The private owner of PointPay is an American of Russian descent.  But PointPay has recruited most of its nearly 150 employees from Russia and the former Soviet sphere. Ukrainians especially were highly educated and could speak, write and work in Russian effortlessly, Kardapoltsev said. With crucial employees scattered throughout a bloc of countries with varying levels of stability, it didn’t take long for a geopolitical contingency to emerge in the form of major protests over gas prices across Kazakhstan in January that threatened to cut five of PointPay’s employees off from the company.  Kardapoltsev offered to relocate those employees to ensure business continuity, covering their travel expenses, but the situation cleared up in two weeks.  “Obviously, a similar crisis might happen in our second-most populous location, Ukraine, so we started making some contingency planning for that,” Kardapoltsev said of the company’s planning earlier this year. “In the beginning, at the end of January, we were anticipating that because (U.S. President Joe) Biden was saying that the attack on Ukraine and the invasion of Donbas (a region in eastern Ukraine) was inevitable, we should be proactive.”  Escape from Ukraine  At that time, PointPay had seven employees in or near Donbas, with most of its Ukrainian employees living in the capital, Kyiv, and in the western parts of the country.  The Donbas employees were located and asked to relocate, but all were unwilling or unable to do so for personal reasons, Kardapoltsev said.  “We asked them to do it as a temporary measure, to treat it as if they were going on holiday, or at least consider moving to Lviv (a city in western Ukraine),” he said. “I thought they would probably be leaving for good, but I told them to think as if it was a vacation – and if you can’t get to Lviv, move into Russia. We couldn’t force it on them, they didn’t listen to us. We told them we would provide them with accommodation, but they said they didn’t want to leave their family.”  Then PointPay decided to locate every person it had working in Ukraine, said Kardapoltsev. “We really didn’t think anything would happen in Kyiv; we thought it would be fine and that this would only affect the eastern part of the country, the Donbas region. We never thought [Russia] would actually try to invade Kyiv and start bombing the whole country.”  On Feb. 20, Kardapoltsev upped the urgency of his messages, asking all male employees to relocate immediately if possible. One employee living in a city near the conflict zone in eastern Ukraine didn’t listen, and during a visit to his grandmother on Feb. 23, he was conscripted on the spot.  “Most of the women in our company managed to escape, they were not conscripted, some men managed to get out of the country,” Kardapoltsev said. One senior member of the C-suite escaped Ukraine in the trunk of a vehicle, while another, who had two newborn babies, made it out of direct harm’s way, but wasn’t able to escape completely and is still taking shelter somewhere in a rural area of the country.  An evolving conflict  PointPay continues to keep track of its employees in Ukraine, including five who are trapped in Kyiv. “We all said that Russians would never invade Kyiv, but now we have five employees in Kyiv who cannot leave the city and who have to sleep in the subways during the night and can’t go back to work during the day,” Kardapoltsev said.  PointPay finds itself stretched by the conflict, but the company has been able to keep operating and is still trying to hire and grow.  But Kardapoltsev also said he and PointPay have faced some anti-Russian sentiments, even though they are not technically a Russian company.  “We’ve already had two employees who outright said that they are not willing to work for a Russian company, even though we’re not based in Russia, I’m not living in Russia, our owner is Russian by heritage but he’s not Russian, he’s American,” Kardapoltsev said. “Most of our company didn’t live in Russia, but due to the fact that people were Russian by blood and that we spoke Russian, they didn’t want to have anything to do with us and they resigned.”  As for other employees in Ukraine, he continued, “Some, we’ve had a couple of employees who asked us for a leave – they managed to escape the war but were so traumatized by events that we gave them two months off. We try to keep in contact with them; some of them didn’t want to work in the industry anymore at all.”  Update: This story has been updated to remove some location and identifying information to protect people who may be at risk in Ukraine.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/03/24/how-one-russian-speaking-crypto-company-is-navigating-the-war-in-ukraine,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/85a94405c23231062c1707d1e3da2a7e8968f0c9-3146x4195.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Thus far, the cryptocurrency has confirmed the line many times, and the subsequent rebound has resulted in the continuous upward movement. The price is rapidly approaching the $44,000 horizontal resistance line, which BTC has not traded above since the first week of January.

A special demoralizing factor for sellers was the trading week on 31 January. As we can see in the weekly timeframe, in a week buyers managed to raise the price by 70%. At the same time, buyers completely absorbed the previous aggressive fall candle from 17 January.

There would be common favorable factors in the whole cryptocurrency market. https://www.tradingview.com/x/0RLYi3FP/ After a triumphant weekly candle from buyers, the next attempt by sellers to continue the fall wave had a rather clumsy appearance.

This fact clearly hints at the complete exhaustion of sellers.

As the crypto market is unregulated and highly regulated, options are a good alternative for those looking to experience price swings of the crypto market, yet want to make exceptional profits. Please remember that this article aims to familiarize you with the world of &apos;DeFi options&apos;. So, never invest more than you can afford to lose. DeFi Options: CSPs and CCs Vaults for Cash-Secured-Puts (CSPs) and Covered-Calls (CCs) are the most prevalent sort of DeFi Options. Vaults offer CSPs and CCs against investors&apos; staked assets at a &apos;secure&apos; strike price, then distribute the premium created by the options as APY to investors. When an investor sells the right to acquire an asset at a striking price, it is known as a CC. For instance: For $14.81 per ETH, you can sell the right to buy your ETH for $3200 on Friday. If the price of ETH is greater than $3200 on Friday, you sell the ETH and keep the premium. You keep your ETH and the premium if it&apos;s less than $3200. A CSP is the polar opposite of a CSP. Investors are compensated for agreeing to buy an asset at a specific price. For instance: For every $2900 invested in ETH, you can earn $33. If the price is $2900 on Friday, you buy ETH at that price and keep the premium. If it&apos;s more than $2900, you keep the premium and your $2900.

Fink's comments are at sharp odds with his previous assessment of client interest in crypto. In July of last year, Fink said in an interview that he is not seeing much demand for digital assets.  His comments seemingly confirm a CoinDesk report from last month that the $10 trillion asset manager is planning to offer crypto trading services to its investor clients.  Fink also wrote that the Russia-Ukraine conflict will push countries to reassess currency dependencies and look to means of payments that can bring down the costs of cross-border transactions.  ""A global digital payment system, thoughtfully designed, can enhance the settlement of international transactions while reducing the risk of money laundering and corruption,"" he wrote.

However, did the buyers really manage to seize the initiative in the market? Does the slowdown in the fall of the SUSHI price in the context of the weekly timeframe have a great chance of a price reversal? Today we will try to establish the truth on these issues. Although the SUSHI price has grown by 30% in two weeks, the total interest of buyers in the market has not yet been identified. Trading volumes have remained low over the past two weeks. All buyers have managed to achieve so far is to absorb the three previous candles of sellers, which also look rather weak. The global trend curve remains under the control of sellers. https://www.tradingview.com/x/2AU6skTo/ Therefore, at the moment, market participants are playing the game &apos;whoever hits weaker will win.&apos; Usually the result of such a game gradually turns into a consolidation with a bright price shot. The decrease in SUSHI price volatility from the end of November 2021 and the transition of its trading to the wedge confirms this scenario. However, it is difficult to say for sure that the new impulse will be in the direction of growth. The fact is that the downward trend curve clearly shows the acceleration and inability of buyers to organize deep upward corrections since March 2021. Usually, such trading situations end with the final impulse of the fall on high volumes.

42435233,wOc5H8d0GcW5NDeNpBuMsA,1648119664,Waves Breaks Into Top 50 Crypto Rankings With 240% Monthly Gain,"A lesser-known cryptocurrency has risen to prominence in a broader market marred by macro uncertainties, thanks to a cocktail of positive fundamental developments and the perception of flows stemming from the digital asset's Russia links.  WAVES is an inflationary token offered as a reward for mining blocks on the decentralized, open-source blockchain Waves. The token has rallied 240% to $30 in the past four weeks and is one of the best-performing coins, with a market capitalization of at least $1 billion, CoinDesk data shows.  The rally has helped the cryptocurrency make it to the list of top 50 cryptocurrencies by market value. At press time, WAVES was the 41st largest digital asset with a market capitalization of $3.35 billion.  ""The main reason waves has climbed up is that Neutrino protocol's total value locked has increased by 338% in the past month,"" Rudy Chen, an analyst at crypto ratings firm TokenInsight, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  Neutrino is an algorithmic price-stable multi-asset protocol based on Waves facilitating the creation of stablecoins with values pegged to real-world assets such as national currencies or commodities. Data tracked by DefiLlama shows Neutrino is the biggest protocol on Waves, accounting for 62% or $1.74 billion of the $2.8 billion locked in the Waves-based decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Total value locked is one of the most commonly used metrics to assess the DeFi sector's growth.  The supply of Neutrino's dollar-pegged decentralized stablecoin USDN has increased substantially in one month, perhaps putting upward pressure on WAVES. Per Messari data, generating USDN requires locking WAVES in Neutrino's smart contracts, while USDN redemptions have the opposite effect of destroying the stablecoin to unlock WAVES supply.  ""The outstanding supply of USDN has increased by approximately 66% since mid-February (around +350 million USDN) which means that an equivalent dollar amount of WAVES was locked up in Neutrino to mint that new amount of USDN,"" Gabriel Tan, investment analyst at The Spartan Group, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. ""This could have been a substantial demand driver for WAVES if a large chunk of the locked-up WAVES was bought off secondary markets.""  CoinGecko data shows the market capitalization of USDN has increased by more than 60% to $736 million in one month, perhaps powering the waves token higher.  According to observers, there have been two sources of demand for USDN and, therefore, bullish pressures for WAVES. First, increased investor interest in staking USDN on Neutrino and other avenues. Second, the broader market lull.  ""Why the increase in the outstanding supply of USDN? It could be because of the relatively high USDN staking annual percentage yield or APR of 9.5% on Neutrino or 19.84% APR for supplying USDN on Vires.finance,"" Spartan's Tan said.  Users can use USDN as collateral to trade or mint synthetic assets or stake the stablecoin to earn an extra yield. Staking refers to holding coins in a cryptocurrency wallet to support network operations in return for newly minted coins. The process is analogous to passive investing. Vires.finance is is a decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol based on Waves Blockchain, enabling users to participate as depositors or borrowers.  Investors typically park their money into stablecoins, which offer price stability and protection from broader market volatility during times of stress. And they may have done so over the past several weeks, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 and the-then lack of clarity about the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary tightening plans weighed over both crypto and traditional markets.  ""When the market fell, people tended to sell their crypto assets and turned into stablecoins. That's why Terra's LUNA token and WAVES outperformed the market, because they both have strong community consensus on their algorithm stablecoin, UST and USDN,"" respectively, Token Insight's Chen noted.  Some have associated the WAVES rally with the recently implemented Waves 2.0 upgrade announced last month. The upgrade is expected to make the network faster, more secure and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible.  However, Spartan's Tan disagrees. ""One could argue that the Waves 2.0 announcement on Feb. 11 triggered the rally, but I think this is unlikely. The rally only started happening in the last week of Feb (unless the markets are so inefficient and slow to price in the announcement),"" Tan quipped, drawing attention to the dour market response to the similar announcements made by other blockchains in the past.  ""If you look at past [Ethereum Virtual Machine] compatibility announcements for other chains like Kava, Cronos and Near, none of those token prices rallied three times in the one to two months post-announcement like what WAVES cryptocurrency has done,"" Tan added.  While developers announced the Waves 2.0 upgrade on Feb. 11, the token began rallying later that month around the time Russia invaded Ukraine. That has some observers wondering whether the early move higher resulted from speculations jumping the gun on Waves blockchain's association with Russia.  ""Waves was misperceived by markets as a Russian/Ukraine-associated project and may have attracted speculative demand from traders who want to ride the Russian/Ukraine narrative,"" Spartan's Tan said.  Waves blockchain is sometimes referred to as Russia's Ethereum owing to its association with Rostec, a Russian manufacturing giant and misconceptions about Waves founder Alexandr ""Sasha"" Ivanov hailing from Russia.  However, Ivanov told Bloomberg early this month that he is a Ukrainian citizen and the rally in WAVES tokens has got nothing to do with the situation in Russia.

42394260,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvaoPX,1648085961,Bitcoin Is Far More Than a New Form of Money,"Although Bitcoin is commonly considered a new form of money, it is far more nuanced.  Bitcoin is a multi-layered financial ecosystem with its own monetary system. Because of this monetary system, Bitcoin is independent of today’s existing financial and monetary system.  Bitcoin’s native monetary system is its chief achievement and a novelty. Over the last two decades, people have tried rebuilding finance using fintech. While many interesting financial applications have resulted from fintech innovations, they all remained bound to the traditional fiat system. True innovation in money and finance has only started with Bitcoin.  Pascal Hügli is the chief researcher at Insight DeFi, a Swiss research boutique. Insight DeFi publishes a bi-monthly newsletter in German here. He is also author of the book “Ignore at Your Own Risk: The New Decentralized World of Bitcoin and Blockchain.”  This is because Bitcoin’s native monetary policy is elegantly simple, and its immutable supply is free from human discretion, something no other money has had since gold. In contrast to the yellow precious metal though, Bitcoin's monetary policy is algorithmically determined and thus perfectly predictable, rule-based. It is neither event- nor emotion-driven.  By depoliticizing monetary policy and grounding it in a code that follows a strict formula, Bitcoin’s monetary asset is structured as neutrally as possible. Bitcoin (BTC) is truly sound money because it provides the highest degree of stability, reliability and security as a monetary system.  A base layer for money  Because this new form of global, digital money resides on a base layer, it’s more apt to speak of Bitcoin’s asset as being base money. This base money is being settled in a distributed fashion on Bitcoin’s blockchain, which acts as the final settlement network within Bitcoin’s native, global monetary system.  So, bitcoin the base money – also known as on-chain bitcoin or BTC that is settled on Bitcoin’s blockchain with finality – is really “just” the first or base layer for a rapidly evolving multi-layered financial order.  This all-important nuance was already clear to Bitcoin's anonymous founder, which is why he chose his terms carefully in the Bitcoin white paper. Satoshi Nakamoto described Bitcoin as an electronic cash system – a subtlety that many have unfortunately missed to this day.  In hindsight, Nakamoto probably should have emphasized the term ""cash,"" as it carries a distinct meaning within monetary theory. Coming from the old French word casse, which means money box or money in hand, cash is defined as a bearer asset that is typically used to settle money transactions. It is therefore a base money asset. So, I believe that Nakamoto intended to introduce the Bitcoin blockchain as a base settlement infrastructure for a blockchain-native base money.  Financial logic on top of Bitcoin  While most people are familiar with Bitcoin’s monetary layer, what goes unnoticed by many is Bitcoin’s rapid development into a financial ecosystem. The reason is that this new system is not directly built into Bitcoin’s protocol code itself.  This quality contrasts starkly from so-called smart contract platforms like Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, Terra or Binance Smart Chain. While these fully programmable blockchains – technically called Turing-complete systems – allow for native smart contract compatibility, Bitcoin’s programming languages script has been intentionally limited. By not going for full programmability on its base layer, Bitcoin has been optimized for stability, reliability as well as security.  Read More: The Importance of Bitcoin Upgrades and Layer Two Applications  With Bitcoin, the implementation of financial logic of any kind has been offloaded to a second layer within its multi-layered financial system. This layer is now populated by sidechains like RSK or Mintlayer, second-layer protocols such as the Lightning Network, or alternative layer 1 blockchains like Stacks that run parallel to Bitcoin and have their own history of transactions on Bitcoin.  These different approaches make up the building blocks of what I call the infrastructure layer within Bitcoin’s financial system. Its purpose is to enhance Bitcoin’s expressive power in some form or another. Meanwhile, this layer is a layer of its own. This way the monetary layer can provide the essential assurances for a sound monetary base asset, while the expressive financial logic in the form of smart contracts is moved off Bitcoin’s blockchain onto the infrastructure layer higher up the stack.  Free-market for innovation on Bitcoin  Bitcoin’s infrastructure layer is spawning a free-market competition for building a financial system on top of Bitcoin. This competition is beneficial to users as more qualitatively different options mean more freedom of choice. So, the bigger and more diverse the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem on Bitcoin, the better.  Regarding consensus and security, users must remember that all projects accept some trade-offs. Because the different protocols do things differently, these tradeoffs will differ by project. This variety also benefits users, who can opt for the options with which they feel most comfortable.  Bitcoin-based financial operating systems  The different DeFi approaches on Bitcoin infrastructure enable smart contract functionality for Bitcoin in various ways. To make this functionality helpful for as many users as possible, financial operating systems operating on Bitcoin and representing the third layer in Bitcoin’s multi-layered financial order will emerge slowly but surely. The components of the infrastructure layers – second layers and sidechains – will act as middlemen between Bitcoin’s base layer blockchain and the financial operating systems.  Read More: Who Sets the Rules of Bitcoin as Nation-States and Corps Roll In  The most prominent Bitcoin-powered financial operating system (OS) to date is built by Sovryn. What Windows OS or Mac OS is to computers, Sovryn is to Bitcoin – an interface that makes financial primitives built on the infrastructure layer usable for everyday users. These financial primitives are liquidity, leverage, risk-taking and arbitrage. The more pronounced these primitives are, the more efficient and functional Bitcoin’s evolving financial order becomes. And this is what financial operating systems like Sovryn are helping to do.  Bitcoin’s native application layer  While a financial operating system like Sovryn can provide various decentralized applications (dapps) in one place, these financial applications can also exist as standalone applications. The beauty of Bitcoin’s open and permissionless setup is that everyone can provide useful software to interact with Bitcoin’s emerging financial order.  The myriad decentralized applications will make up the fourth layer within Bitcoin’s multi-layered financial order. Token swaps, leveraged trading, collateralized lending, uncollateralized lending and more are all emerging as a feature on top of Bitcoin. Depending on what infrastructure setup users prefer – be it RSK, Liquid, Mintlayer or any other that has yet to emerge – they can choose freely.  Wallets play a decisive role in this monetary system. Digital wallets that allow interaction with Bitcoin-powered services like Muun, Hiro, Liquality or with Ethereum-based MetaMask are to blockchains what browsers are to the internet. They allow users to easily access the underlying technology.  As the fifth and highest layer, wallets come most naturally to users and complete Bitcoin’s multi-layered financial order. The higher up the stack we move, the more room for innovation and development there is.  DeFi on Bitcoin is alive and progressing well. While it is still underdeveloped compared to the rest of DeFi, chances are that DeFi based on Bitcoin will grow.  After all, many more Bitcoiners might look for a place to use some of their Bitcoin stash to conduct their Bitcoin-powered finances.
