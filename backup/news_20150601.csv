42398411,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTROY,1433191833,Ecuador Mandates Bank Participation in National E-Money Initiative,"Ecuador’s e-money initiative, which kicked off earlier this year after the country outlawed bitcoin, is about to see wider institutional involvement following a government directive.  The country’s banks were ordered late last month to adopt the payment system within the next year, according to a report by Pan-Am Post’s Belén Marty. The pace at which the banks are required to add support for the initiative, which is a digital representation of the US dollar – Ecuador’s official currency – depends on their size.  Ecuadorean banks that possess $1b or more in assets have 120 days to integrate, whereas banks with less than $150m have 360 days as of 26th May to add support. Banks with an amount of assets that fall between those amounts have 150 days to do so.  The order covers a broad swath of Ecuadorean companies, covering both private and public institutions, as well as entities ""that maintain a network of establishments available for clients and are capable of acquiring mobile money"", as reported by Pan-Am Post.  According to the resolution outlining the adoption timeline, the initiative’s intent is to “seek efficiency in payment systems to promote and contribute to the economic stability of the country.”  Plans for the “electronic money” system were struck last year, when the country’s legislature passed a bill prohibiting bitcoin and paving the way for the new currency system to take shape.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | FIAT | REGULATION,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/06/01/ecuador-mandates-bank-participation-in-national-e-money-initiative,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2d925a2ccc5d270bc70d06d1297a7c536cac6aa0-2560x1714.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398417,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTRTT,1433178930,Taringa’s Content Creation Surges Following Bitcoin Integration,"Argentinean social network platform Taringa has seen creative content generation rise by an average of 40 to 50% after users joined its new bitcoin tipping initiative.  The programme  , 'Taringa Creadores', combines an ad-revenue sharing model with the social network's unique ranking system in a bid to incentivise the sharing of user generated content.  Content creators registered to Taringa's bitcoin tipping scheme receive a Xapo wallet and a share of advertising distributed in bitcoin by Taringa. Users can tip each other in bitcoin, as every creator receives 10 daily points to distribute among other users. When distributed, these points are issued out in digital currency.  The initiative is still in beta stage, with 2,000 invite-only users constituting the platform's top content creators taking part at this stage. Speaking about the decision to implement bitcoin tipping, Taringa co-founder Hernán Botbol told CoinDesk:  ""We have always wanted to give our users a economic reward because we think its fair. We want more and more people to post on Taringa and for these people to eventually be able to leave their jobs and dedicate their time exclusively to posting on Taringa.""  Bitcoin's viability  Botbol said that his team had explored various payout options, all of which would required users to hold a bank account.  ""We always came up against the same problem; most people in the region do not have a bank account, they don't have a debit card and money transfers are generally expensive,"" he said.  Plans to reward users were ultimately shelved until the team was approached by good friend and fellow Argentinean entrepreneur Wences Casares, founder and CEO of bitcoin services provider Xapo.  Botbol said of the growing partnership that followed:  ""We realised it was possible to connect both his [Casares'] mission, which is to spread bitcoin's adoption and for it to become a popular payment method and our wish to establish a revenue share scheme to reward our users.""  Development push  Botbol framed the process today as one that is laying the foundations for a more in-depth user ecosystem.  ""Eventually we will have a lot of people who will have funds in their Xapo wallet and who will immediately be able to access games, streaming accounts, etc,"" he explained.  User demand for such development, Botbol added, is fueling these efforts. Botbol said that many of the first publications that surfaced following the Xapo integration and the subsequent launch of 'Taringa Creadores' evidenced users' interest in bitcoin donations.  ""We are looking into implementing a donation button that would enable users with bitcoin to donate directly from Taringa,"" said Botbol.  Bitcoin education  Botbol said that Taringa's advantageous position in the Argentinian market – it is credited with having 26 million users – will help drive bitcoin's adoption in the country.  He said of these efforts:  ""We are working to ensure that bitcoin becomes simple, we want the integration [with Xapo] to be user friendly and we are working to communicate what bitcoin really is to our users and we really think that Taringa's community has achieved a better understanding.""  Botbol added that Taringa hopes to have as many as one million bitcoin wallets by 2016. To get there, he said, will involve a social push that will enable more online purchasing by consumers.  ""If bitcoin is going to ever reach mainstream adoption, it will do so in Argentina,"" he concluded.  Hernán Botbol is speaking at Consensus 2015 in New York. Join him at the TimesCenter on 10th September. A list of the event speakers can be found here.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | MINING,Yessi Bello Perez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/06/01/taringas-content-creation-surges-following-bitcoin-integration,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/215471d6a49ff8d9836a93401dcba50f65ade3ae-1500x1144.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398396,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTRDj,1433161896,Ripple Appoints DTCC’s Former CEO as Advisor,"Digital currency startup Ripple Labs has appointed Donald Donahue, former CEO of the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) as an advisor to the company.  DTCC  is the main clearing house for US securities and derivatives, processing more than $1.6 quadrillion in transactions per year.  In his role as COO and then CEO, Donahue is thought to have led the DTCC's efforts in stabilising the financial system following the 2007-08 market crash.  Donahue said in a company statement:  ""I am very interested in the capabilities distributed payment technologies seem to offer for improving the safety, soundness and cost effectiveness of global payments and settlement infrastructures.""  Donahue also worked with the US Treasury Department and other governmental and private sector groups to improve physical and cyber security in the financial sector following the attacks on the World Trade Centre on 11th September 2001.  Digital Assets  , founded by entrepreneurs Sunil Hirani and Don Wilson in 2014, is likely to disrupt some of DTCC's market share as it sets out to revolutionise the traditional, centralised financial model by enabling customers to convert traditional securities – and other financial products – into digital assets which can be stored on the blockchain.  Blythe Masters, a former notable Wall Street executive, joined the bitcoin trading platform as CEO in March.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Yessi Bello Perez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2015/06/01/ripple-appoints-dtccs-former-ceo-as-advisor,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
