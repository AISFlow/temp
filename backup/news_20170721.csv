42400206,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIvBR,1500672044,Understanding Bitcoin's Scaling Debate: Politics Comes First,"Jim Harper is vice president of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, where he works to adapt law and policy to the information age. A former counsel to committees in both the US House and the US Senate, he served as Global Policy Counsel for the Bitcoin Foundation in 2014.  In this opinion piece, Harper lays out how politics controls many of the decisions being made in the bitcoin scaling debate, offering a solution for those involved.      Software programmers are usually collegial and collaborative, but parts of the bitcoin developer community have been displaying the kind of acrimony familiar to political capitols like Washington, D.C.  Understanding the nature of the scaling debate might help the bitcoin community better iterate on the protocol and software in the future. What's behind the strife when amendments to bitcoin's rules – or stasis – become so controversial? What unrecognized dimensions of the debate have allowed it to become so divisive and debased?  One is collective resistance to the fact that decisions about bitcoin's direction are political decisions, which technical decisions must follow. Priorities vary, but the bitcoin community's aims include global financial inclusion and economic development, human liberty and dignity, privacy and a truly stable money supply.  By debating only in terms of technology, the leading advocates for different paths have failed to articulate any unifying human vision for bitcoin's future. That's a recipe for alienating intellectual war.  The news isn't all bad: The scaling debate will be concluded using market forces. Bitcoin escapes politics as practiced in coercive government.  It just doesn't escape politics all the way.  Group choices are political  The bitcoin protocol and software are technical, obviously, in that they involve the application of technology to interesting challenges. How to configure bitcoin is political, though, because it involves choices made by groups.  Choosing in groups is no simple thing. The first step in group decision-making is to constitute a group. People are usually better off when they work together under a common set of rules. Bitcoin's protocol is a clear example. But what commits them to any group?  Social contract theory is the leading explanation in modern Western philosophy for life under governments. Nobody ever actually signs that contract, so it’s a little dissatisfying.  Bitcoin's version of the social contract is ""consensus."" That commonly used word contains the idea that using the bitcoin protocol reflects agreement with its terms. But this isn't necessarily the case. Treating use as agreement is probably insulting to dissenters from the status quo – just like ""social contract"" dissatisfies many U.S. citizens obligated to pay taxes for unending war.  Confusingly, ""consensus"" is also used to denote synchronization of blockchain data among bitcoin nodes.  However they feel about it, bitcoin users have joined a group, and they have choices to make together.  Open-source despotism?  Once a group is constituted, ""it may appear that the chiefs, leaders or shamans of the group exert coercive force on members."" Those are the words of public choice economists Michael and Kevin Munger in their book Choosing in Groups.  Happily, there is no literal coercion in bitcoin-land, but it harkens to the observation of Konrad Graf that the maximum block size, a ""production ceiling"" on transactions, is economically equivalent to a government intervention. Dissenters from the status quo feel the familiar strains of tyranny, which they thought bitcoin would help everyone escape.  That is nonsensical and shocking to the Core side, who see themselves as following standard open-source development processes. Their conservative approach, including maintenance of the 1MB limit on bitcoin blocks, safeguards a $40 billion asset, securing it against the predations of real governments.  To them, the most satisfying explanations for opposition to their approach range from simple ignorance to profit-hungry short-termism on the part of bitcoin companies.  Open source in the commercial layer  The software development mode exemplified by Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standard-setting processes is an attractive and successful model of cooperation. But bitcoin development may diverge from the theory about open source that the IETF helped spawn.  Open-source development does not automatically digest and balance community values, enshrining them in code. In the dominant bitcoin implementation, a small number of people have commit access, and they have disproportionate power to determine what goes into the code base. These humans, intending only the best, are subject to the influence of their own premises, their social circle and a simple incapacity to capture and prioritize all the interests that would be served by a global public utility such as bitcoin.  The user side of the equation also fails the theory, stated well by economist Vili Lehdonvirta that ""Bitcoin is purely 'math-based money,' and all the developers are doing is purely apolitical plumbing work.""  Developers have relatively greater power because many bitcoin users do not have the technical capacity to reconfigure their own code or to choose wisely from among competing implementations.  Bitcoin developers have also had far fewer meetings than the IETF did at a similar stage. The reservoir of goodwill was already low before the scaling debate drained it.  And bitcoin development may be materially different from other standards-setting efforts. We may be seeing for the first time what happens when open-source software development hits the commercial layer.  Technical communications standards are essentially neutral as to the content or meaning they will convey. Bitcoin standards define and shape markets.  One illustration of the power of the protocol is the rise in transaction fees, which for the time being has cut off use cases such as payments and savings for people in poorer parts of the world. That is no technical engineering decision. It delays crucial economic development that otherwise would sustain and bring joy to potentially millions or even billions of people.  Needed: visionary leadership  That vision – of bitcoin at its best, having its most tremendous consequences – has been notably absent from the scaling debate. If at all, the sides represent their animating goals ambiguously as ""payments"" on the one hand or ""digital gold"" on the other.  Among many of its social capital deficits, bitcoin lacks visionary leadership.  The outcomes sought by the bitcoin community are widely agreed upon, but they are typically left unspoken.  A development team that articulates a view of bitcoin's horizons in human terms could unify the community. Then, given more study of the economics of bitcoin's systems, technical decisions could follow. Such decisions could be made with wide understanding that the trade-offs involved are faithful to the bitcoin community’s widely agreed-upon goals. At present that is left unclear.  Network effects  Network effects, of course, are the shackles that keep many dissenters chained to bitcoin, and (they feel) under the yoke of Core. The current threat of chain splits may produce a real-world test of how many bitcoin versions can exist.  Experience with ethereum and ethereum classic suggest that multiple chains can co-exist. And, for three reasons, network effects don't dictate disaster from chain splits:  It is easy to transfer among cryptocurrencies, for instance via Shapeshift.io. This means there can be a viable digital gold, a viable payments crypto and many others.  At a global scale, there are enough users to maintain several currencies. A global niche market may still be a big market.  It is a relatively small technical iteration to make all wallets, exchanges, payments gateways, etc. accept all major cryptocurrencies. The relevant ""network"" may not be any one cryptocurrency, but all of them.  The bitcoin community has a lot to learn about itself and what it is doing in the scaling debate.  The debate's tenor – those angry words and base insinuations – are commonplace in political capitols like Washington, D.C. But at the end of the day in those places, vicious political opponents can also get together to cooperate on matters of agreement.  Whatever the outcome, bitcoin users should expect that kind of professionalism and maturity from all participants in the scaling debate.

42400202,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIv8U,1500669047,Faster Payments? Startup Pitches Federal Reserve Group on Cryptocurrency,"A specialized task force set up by the U.S. Federal Reserve has received a slew of new proposals outlining how it might utilize technology to speed up services.  In total, 16 proposals from various payment providers were submitted to the Faster Payments Task Force, convened by the Federal Reserve in 2015 as a way to channel strategic thinking on how it could update its processes and technology.  As outlined in a new report, five submissions incorporated some form of blockchain technology, including filings by companies Eccho, Hub Culture, Kalypton Group, Nanopay Corporation, Ripple, Thought Matrix Consulting and Xalgorithms.  But perhaps the most notable published is by Wingcash, which goes as far as to propose that the Federal Reserve issue its own cryptocurrency.  The proposal states:  ""(WingCash Faster Payment Network is) a software platform that would be owned and operated by the Federal Reserve and the Governing Organization. The Federal Reserve would issue digital currency (digital Fed notes) and is tied to the Internet domain (Fednotes.com).""  Written by Bradley Wilkes, who according to the company's website is the founder and CEO of WingCash, the proposal, if ever adopted, would find the US central bank taking steps toward embracing the long-discussed ""Fedcoin"" concept long used as an illustration of the technology and its potential.  While central banking authorities from countries like U.K., Russia and China have indicated interests in issuing their own cryptocurrencies, this may be the first time a proposal has been addressed directly to the Federal Reserve.  Still, the report notes the inclusion of the proposal should not ""imply any endorsement or recommendation"" on behalf of the Federal Reserve.

42400221,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIvQC,1500655555,NRI Subsidiary Launches Blockchain Technology Assessment Service,"NRI SecureTechnologies, a cybersecurity subsidiary of Japanese information security provider NRI, has announced a new blockchain service.  But what separates this offering, according to the release, is that it is designed specifically for systems that use blockchain technology. More specifically, it will seek to analyze and simulate attacks on smart contracts, or self-executing code that runs on a blockchain.  The firms said in future phases, it will develop the service to be able to assess the overall architecture of a blockchain system, including its API, multi-signature wallets, key management systems and top-level applications.  The need for such an offering can be seen as the broader industry responds to recent heists in the cryptocurrency and blockchain world.  Last year, for example, the infamous hack of DAO resulted in customers losing $60 million worth of ether, at the time through a coding error in the smart contract.  Further, just this week, CoinDash had 34,000 ethers stolen during its initial coin offering, and another hacker drained 150,000 ethers through a security bug in multi-signature wallet software offered by Parity Technologies.  The product launch also follows Japan's decision to regulate bitcoin as a legal payment method, a decision that made it the first country to put in place national rules for the industry.

According to a statement from the startup, the grant seeks to formally recognize its capacity in developing corporate payment solutions based on distributed ledger technologies (DLT). The startup said the funds would be used to its suite of develop e-commerce and content monetization solutions.      Further, while Horizon 2020 provides €80 billion in funds from 2014 to 2020 for a wide range of innovation companies, this is perhaps the first funding offer from the program to a blockchain-related startup. Specifically Billon Group's grant came from a subsidiary SME Instrument program, which has offered €3 billion during the same period for high-potential SMEs.      Tadeusz Kuropatwinski, Billion's managing director of digital payments business, added:      ""We believe content monetization and eCommerce payments will be one of the main drivers behind the global demand for micropayments, especially in emerging markets. Billon expects to launch merchant services for eCommerce and content monetization this autumn in Poland and in 2018 in the UK.""              The funding also continues Billion's history of working with government programs.      As reported in November last year, Billon was selected to the first phase of a Sandbox program launched by the U.K.'s regulation watchdog Financial Conduct Authority, designed specifically for testing DLT products in a supervised environment.

42400214,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIvLH,1500644731,Crypto Asset Class Clears $90 Billion as Bitcoin Price Spikes,"Spurred by a massive uptick in the price of bitcoin, the total value of all cryptocurrencies passed $90 billion yesterday, a high not observed since early July.  With the move, the market capitalization of the asset class is again advancing toward $100bn, a figure it first exceeded in June when it reached an all-time high of $115bn.  At press time, the market is valued at just over $94 billion.  Still, it remains to be seen how much of that capital will remain given the rapid escalation observed in the price.  On Thursday, the price of bitcoin increased from just under $2,500 to a high of $2,889 amid an increasingly positive outlook for its technology development, analysts said.  Data from Coinmarketcap indicates the market capitalization of the digital asset increased accordingly, rising to $46 billion, from an opening figure of $37.9 billion.  Despite the rising bitcoin price, however, other assets have been performing strongly.  At publication, nine of the top 10 cryptocurrencies were showing gains, with only one, ether, showcasing a slight 24-hour decline. The figures further suggest an influx of largely new capital into bitcoin, rather than investors repositioning prior investments.

42400198,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcItAU,1500642014,Utility Settlement Coin Creator to Open-Source Modular Blockchain Software,"The company behind the Utility Settlement Coin project, one of the first designed to enable central banks to utilize distributed ledger tech, is preparing a coming-out party of sorts.  After working in almost complete secret on what founder and CEO Robert Sams calls ""foundational technology,"" venture-backed blockchain startup Clearmatics will soon begin a rather unusual roll-out of new offerings for the open-source community.  In a new exclusive interview, Sams said he plans to share the first of several waves of software with the financial sector before the year’s end.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We view the technology – the actual source code – in a very modular way, and we think that not only is this a space that definitely, firmly belongs in the open-source domain, the approach to the development of the software needs to be more modular.""  While little is being revealed about the technology itself, Sams contrasted his platform with bitcoin, which relies on an unspent-transaction model, and ethereum, which uses an account-based system.  Instead, Sams said the yet-to-be named software will be ""tightly coupled"" implementations of various components, distributed consensus algorithms and networking stacks.  He compared the modular architecture to the various components of the Linux operating system, saying the software would be coupled with standards for how users implement the solution.  ""You'll see over time less and less discussion about this or that platform,"" said Sams. ""And more and more discussion ... on how to put these components together to conform to a set of standardizations.""  Twin projects  While Sams acknowledged that his work with the Utility Settlement Coin, his most well-known project, ""informs"" the soon-to-be-revealed open-source code, he made explicit that they are distinct from each other.  Last year, Clearmatics unveiled a Utility Settlement Coin consortium comprised of BNY Mellon, Deutsche Bank, Santander and ICAP – since rebranded as NEX.  Sams said the group recently completed the second phase of its work to help central banks and other financial infrastructure providers capitalize on blockchain, but that the results would remain proprietary.  While the Utility Settlement Coin project is largely focused on the business logic required to help legacy financial infrastructures increase efficiency using blockchain technology, Sams said the open-source work itself will largely consist of technology and an early version of related standards.  Sams concluded:  ""The open-sourcing of Clearmatics is not the open-sourcing of Utility Settlement Coin.""

42400184,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIt0e,1500639316,ECB President: Cryptocurrency Price Boom Having Limited Effect on Economy,"The president of the European Central Bank (ECB) has issued remarks addressing the rising interest in cryptocurrencies as an asset class.  In a letter  to members of the European parliament this week, Mario Draghi built on statements made during a May hearing, in which he first discussed financial innovation, including the ""rapid pace of development"" in digital ledger (DLT) and related technologies. At the time, he cautioned that care must be taken so that fintech, including blockchain and DLT, does not disrupt the financial system.  Published this week, the new letter builds on this commentary, addressing more directly the rise in cryptocurrency prices so far in 2017. Driven by big gains in bitcoin and ether, the value of the total supply of all cryptocurrencies is now $93bn, down slightly from an all-time high of $115bn earlier this year.  Still, in the face of this increase, Draghi used the opportunity to restate his belief that cryptocurrencies still have a limited impact on the financial system.  Draghi wrote:  ""Although the market capitalisation of [virtual currency schemes] has increased since the publication of these reports, there is no evidence to suggest that the connection of VCS to the real economy has strengthened significantly.""  Citing past research from the ECB, Draghi indicated he still believes there could be a ""build-up of risks"" due to the use of cryptocurrencies, which may necessitate an international regulatory response.  Still, for now, he said the ECB would likely take steps to continue to monitor the ecosystem, tracking the ""number, structure and scope"" of public blockchain tokens.  ""An increase in the usage of [virtual currency schemes] is conceivable. It is thus important to monitor the take-up of VCS from a financial stability perspective,"" he said.

42400197,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcItBT,1500636607,Trust Your Odometer? Blockchain Test Aims to Turn Tide on Car Tampering,"When BigchainDB CEO Bruce Pon was working as a project manager for automaker Daimler in the mid-2000s, he envisioned a simple solution for generating and verifying the story of a vehicle.  How was it driven? How many miles were on the clock? And so on.  Gathering and presenting this data was possible, but maintaining its veracity simply wasn't possible at the time.  ""It was an idea I had thought of in 2008. Why couldn’t you create a 'digital twin' of a vehicle, of all the parts, and the actions that have occurred on that vehicle?” he said.  This ""twin"" would serve as an immutable version of the car, detailing how many miles it had driven, or if its maintenance was up to scratch.  Pon told CoinDesk:  ""We looked at doing this in 2008 and the technology wasn’t there because we didn't have blockchain, we didn't have this universal basis for people to confidently share information.""  Fast forward nearly 10 years and Pon's startup, BigchainDB, is immersed in an ongoing project with German energy company Innogy revolving around just this concept.  The project’s ambitious aim is to create a digital identity on the blockchain of any physical good that will verify its provenance.  The clocking problem  The secondhand car market is rife with question marks and even outright fraud. Sellers and dealerships could tamper with a car's odometer to reduce the number of miles on the clock, making the vehicle appear in better shape than it actually is.  Odometer fraud, or ""clocking,"" is by no means new, but it's an issue that continues to plague the industry.  A Ferrari dealership in Florida, for example, became wrapped up earlier this year in a lawsuit that claims it was clocking odometers on its luxury cars.  To tackle this, Pon's CarPass project creates a record of the odometer and vehicle activity with the data visible and verifiable on the digital twin platform.  ""If someone starts tampering with the mileage, you basically see it as a step change in the data that someone tampered with [it],"" said Carsten Stöcker, who heads up Innogy’s blockchain efforts.  True story  But clocking is just one component. CarPass wants to record and show the entire story of a car.  The system captures information from a car's telematics box, and logs the data on the ledger. The telematics box, or ""black box,"" measures how the car has been driven and operated.  However, on its own, the black box is not enough.  ""One of the big problems was that nobody trusted one specific entity to own that automotive data,"" said Pon, adding:  ""With digital twin, what it means is, in a blockchain environment, you can have different parties giving you different information, so a TomTom device could give navigation, geolocation; [Internet of Things] could give you whether or not the shocks in the brakes were used harder than normal. The car manufacturer or components supplier could give additional data about components for predictive maintenance.""  This creates a ""true story"" of the car, he said.  Wider benefits  But there are other advantages as well.  This data can be used for predictive analytics to help estimate a more accurate resale value, or if the car has been abused as a result of the driver's handling of the vehicle. This immutable data and verification has benefits for insurance providers, dealerships and drivers themselves, since they can trust the data provided.  The scalability of blockchain is a potential inhibitor of the system, though, especially when it comes to fees like those seen on the bitcoin blockchain.  CarPass and the digital twin was first built using ethereum as the prototype, but the team eventually shifted to a newcomer platform called IOTA for the proof-of-concept.  Unlike other blockchains, IOTA's peer-to-peer Tangle network allows IoT devices to share data with no fees, said David Sonstebo, founder of IOTA, adding:  ""You want to ensure that that data is completely tamper-proof and that is what any distributed ledger can bring. But IOTA can bring it in a unique way in the sense that it doesn’t get inhibited by fees and scaling limitations like regular blockchain.""  In the proof-of-concept, IOTA manages the many transactions taking place at speed and keeps the costs down, while Bigchain captures and stores all the metadata from these transactions.  Into the real world  So far, Innogy has already rolled CarPass out across one of its car fleets in a trial aimed to demonstrate the service in action.  And there are plans to expand the number of trials too.  ""We are in touch with a couple of automotive OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] and they’re preparing proofs-of-concept to experience the technology,"" he said.  Yet, CarPass is just one proof-of-concept for the digital twin idea, and much wider uptake will be needed across different verticals to realize its full potential.  Innogy and BigchainDB are also working with Austrian blockchain startup Riddle&Code to develop a test for authenticating clothing with a blockchain, embedding NFC chips in the material.  The next step is building an ecosystem around the digital twin platform, Stöcker added:  ""We are in now in discussion with other industrial players to form a consortium.""

According to a criminal complaint filed in an Eastern District of Pennsylvania Federal Court, the man, named Theodore Price, had been apprehended for stealing two laptops and a gold necklace.  While the story may not seem like much at first, it's during the subsequent investigation where things got interesting. Price eventually told law enforcement officials he had stolen the sizable bitcoin stash.

42400188,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIt2c,1500596294,BIP 91 Locks In: What This Means for Bitcoin and Why It's Not Scaled Yet,"BIP 91 has officially locked in.  At press time, bitcoin's miners, the network of computer operators that secure the blockchain, have now been signaling that they will upgrade the code for 269 blocks in the same signaling period, a move that takes the software one step closer to changing its structure to accommodate more transactions.  Stepping back, the move finds miners agreeing to cement the first part of a larger effort to upgrade bitcoin, called Segwit2x.  The controversial proposal seeks to change the transaction structure of the network via Segregated Witness, and increase a cap on the amount of data that can be stored in transaction blocks, a move tentatively scheduled for later this fall.  With the signaling, mining pools nearly unanimously rallied behind the proposal, and BIP 91, designed partly to avoid a potential bitcoin split in the network, emerged as the first major step in following the roadmap.  In response, bitcoin saw a sharp price increase on Thursday due to the perceived forward progress, with some calling the BIP 91 lock-in a victory marking a ""new dawn"" for bitcoin.  But, the lock-in is just the first step to activating SegWit on the network, and other steps come with a bit more complexity.  Specifically, the following things need to happen for it to activate:  There will be a 336-block ""grace period,"" taking about two and a half days, during which miners have time to prepare for activation.  BIP 91 will activate at block 477,120. Theoretically, mining pools will start rejecting blocks that do not signal support for SegWit (BIP 141). In this way, BIP 91 is a ""coordination mechanism"" that gets other mining pools to follow along or lose out on mining rewards.  SegWit could lock-in during the next difficulty adjustment period of 2016 blocks, which takes about two weeks.  The latter is when Segwit activation is ""all in the clear,"" as BIP 91 creator James Hilliard put it.  That's when bitcoin's SegWit upgrade will be official, and an upcoming user-activated soft fork (UASF) proposal, BIP 148, superseded.  Possible hiccups  But some community members, including respected bitcoin developers and mining pool operators are raising concerns about possible missteps between the time BIP 91 is activated and SegWit locks in.  These concerns boil down to:  Thinking miners might not be running the software they signal. If enough mining pools – over 50% – are not running the software, it could impact whether SegWit goes through or not.  Speculating that mining pools might run the correct software for a while, then stop before SegWit locks in.  In simpler terms, some bitcoin users don’t trust others to keep their word.  Bitcoin Core contributor Bryan Bishop seems like one of those, suggesting via Twitter that one potential outcome is SegWit not activating at all this time around, even though a few scaling proposals are coming to a head soon.  WeChat saves the day?  But Hilliard waves that apprehension off. ""There'd have to be a lot of mess ups,"" he told CoinDesk.  For him, it just doesn't seem likely since lock-in has recently been at the top of mining pool operator's priority list. Behind the scenes, he and other pool operators have been restlessly working to ensure BIP 91 goes according to plan and bitcoin transitions to the new ruleset smoothly.  Plus, even more Core contributors, who have been largely opposed to Segwit2x, are helping smooth the transition. Bitcoin Core contributor Matt Corallo has been making updates to FIBRE, the fast block-relaying network miners use, which Hilliard said is ""probably what’s holding a lot of this together.""  It seems many people want to see BIP 91 succeed, likely in an effort to supersede more aggressive alternatives such as BIP 148. While Hilliard agrees with the concept of a UASF, he believes BIP 148 could be riskier than BIP 91.  And finally, because transitioning to the new BIP 91 rules relies on mining pools alone, Hilliard said:  ""This is where mining centralization makes things easier, because I can just message everybody on WeChat and help them if needed.""
