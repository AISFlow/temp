42376442,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AdkN,1367948623,Breathe ... bitcoin's just currency,"The idea of bitcoin has a lot to recommend it. In particular, a global currency that requires few or no middlemen (thus keeping transaction costs low) has special appeal in a world where it seems like every bank and credit-card company is looking for yet another way to squeeze a few bucks or quid in ""service fees"" from customers who don't notice a lot of, you know, service.  But it would be wise for even the most fanatical bitcoin devotee to remember this: bitcoin is still just a human invention. A highly clever and useful one, no doubt ... but still susceptible to all the human foibles and pitfalls any other human invention is susceptible to.  So get used to more CoinLab vs. Mt. Gox lawsuits. Don't be surprised by turf wars, sniping, pettiness, back-stabbing and other ugliness among bitcoin entrepreneurs and developers. And take any suggestions that a bitcoin economy will be a fair, free-market utopia with a very large grain of salt.  Whatever bitcoin's promise, it was created by -- and is used by -- humans who will continue to show human tendencies, good and bad, in their interactions and transactions.  As reddit user listbyloc noted in his comment last week about the CoinLab-Mt. Gox kerfuffle:  ""First, it's just a lawsuit. Thousands are filed every day. Breathe. From the complaint, it looks like CoinLab had an agreement with Mt. Gox. CoinLab probably paid a pretty penny (er, satoshi) for that agreement. CoinLab is now alleging that Mt. Gox is not holding up its end of the bargain. What would you do in this situation?""  ""Correct,"" responded user jgarzik. ""It is quite normal, within a trade group, for members to sue each other. Let's make an analogy with the Linux Foundation, which is set up as a neutral trade group promoting Linux, funding Linus Torvalds, funding kernel.org, and Linux-related conferences ... If you follow the tech press at all, you can see that they sue each other all the time. tl;dr (that's ""too long; didn't read""): breathe.""  Yes, with bitcoin -- unlike with other fiat currencies -- ""the whole world is now your market,"" bitcoin's lead developer and Bitcoin Foundation chief scientist Gavin Andresen recently told the Wall Street Journal.  For someone whose life has revolved around the virtual currency for years, though -- the Bitcoin Foundation pays his salary in bitcoins -- Andresen displays a remarkably sanguine attitude:  ""I tell people it's still an experiment and only invest time or money you could afford to lose.""  Computer security expert Dan Kaminsky echoes that philosophy in a recent Wired commentary. He quotes the Winklevii -- the twin nemeses of Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook -- on their devotion to bitcoins: ""We have elected to put our money and faith in a mathematical framework that is free of politics and human error"" ... and responds:  ""Nothing made by humans is ever free of politics or even error.""  In other words, breathe. Bitcoin's just currency. It isn't the fiat saviour or the downfall of economies.

42376449,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AdtB,1367938802,Did Chinese whispers fuel download spike?,"The weekend's bitcoin unsupported rumour was that China is to support the currency ... allegedly.  If you thought parts of the bitcoin community were susceptible to swallowing rumors, this latest incident just took it up a notch.  A user on reddit posted a link -- and summary -- of a documentary on bitcoin from CCTV  , the Chinese state broadcaster. This, before a translation had even been offered, was taken as tacit support from the Chinese government for the currency.  Whodunnit?  A more likely explanation came from a reddit user who took the view that cock-up is more likely than conspiracy.  Reddit user avsa said:    ""More like:      -""Ying, is there anything about cryptocurrencies on the official censor list?"" -""no, what's that?"" -""I don't know, it sounded complicated"" -""whatever then""    ""Governments aren't one omniscient being, but lots of bureaucrats who just want their payday.""    If the Chinese government has an interest in ending the dollar's reign as effective currency of exchange, one has to wonder why they buy quite so many US government bonds. And why they'd choose an anonymous, uncontrollable, web-based currency as its replacement.  Spiked  The story was bolstered by apparent record downloads of bitcoin clients to China -- which is no surprise given the TV show, and doesn't prove support from the Chinese government or anyone else.  Nor should we ignore the existing attitude to Chinese alternative currencies. Asia's interest in social networking began long before the US' and Europe's did. Many of these included internal currencies -- though, admittedly, these were for buying widgets for your homepage, rather than true attempts at real-world currencies.  The most popular Chinese social network is QQ, which started as an instant messenging clone. QQ added functions from South Korea's Cyworld, which was an Asian Facebook before Mark Zuckerberg had even started coding Thefacebook.  Cyworld not only cracked early social networking but also got its customers to pay for it. South Korean kids were keen not only to build a basic ""minihompy"" (mini-homepage) but also paid to decorate the page and to play background music on it.  So QQ users in China can use Q coins to buy digital items for their homepages. But the coins were starting to bleed out onto other sites and were beginning to be used for yuan exchanges and ""real"" goods and services. That was until the Chinese government put a stop to it.  Not today, thank you  Q coins are not bitcoins ... but they might tell us more about Chinese attitudes to online currencies than a supposed spike in client downloads over a bank holiday weekend.  Cyworld lost out to Facebook in the end, not helped by a hack attack which compromised almost the entire South Korean population.  The real reason the Chinese government is not yet embracing bitcoin is because to do so would require it to change its entire attitude to the internet and privacy.  Giving Chinese citizens access to the tools they'd need to use bitcoins -- like Tor networks and other encryption technologies -- seems highly unlikely.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT,CoinDesk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/07/did-chinese-whispers-fuel-download-spike,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/36a80b76215acf8602326cd03b5b7a49208d1537-628x404.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376450,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AduR,1367916962,What about ven? Stan Stalnaker talks digital currency,"CoinDesk caught up with Stan Stalnaker - founder of Hub Culture, a business club for international travellers and go-getters. When Hub Culture set up, it launched its own currency, Ven.  CD: How do you describe Ven to your friends?  SS: Ven is a global digital currency that’s easy to use and great for the environment. It can be traded instantly to anyone with no transaction cost inside HubCulture.com. Since Ven is 100 percent backed for issuance, the underlying components that make up the value of Ven are important. By including carbon (along with other commodities and currencies), we are able to create a stable currency that supports the environment. So every time you use it, you’re helping the planet.  CD: How did you come up with the idea?  SS: We needed a single price for goods and services traded among the members of Hub Culture, our global collaboration network that grew out of the book of the same name, published in 2002. In 2007, we launched the Ven to help the community transact in a more simple way. From there, it evolved to have an exchange rate, a backing basket and other features.  CD: Which institution controls Ven?  SS: The Hub Culture social network controls the Ven and manages issuance.  CD: How is inflation controlled?  SS: We minimize inflation risk by maintaining a 100 percent reserve backing for Ven in issuance – which means that for any Ven out in the world, there are reserve funds equal to the component value of the underlying basket. Inflation is slower than in normal fiat currency because part of the basket is commodities, but it cannot be totally removed because much of the underlying reserves are regular currencies, which are indeed subject to inflation.  CD:What safeguards are in place to protect the currency?  SS: In addition to online security and ID factors for transfer, one of the biggest advantages of Ven is the social, transparent nature that comes with operating Ven linked to a social network. The socially open component of Ven makes visibility a major security feature.  CD: Can you bank in Ven?  SS: It depends on what you mean by this. Ven accounts function similarly to a bank account, enabling store of value, exchange and the ability to invest Ven into a number of virtual currency-related funds and assets. Major banks like Citibank have been at the forefront of Ven growth by purchasing Ven for their own use, but the banks themselves are not yet trading Ven.  CD: Can you print Ven when you need to? What safeguards are in place to stop that?  SS: Since Ven is totally digital, the release of currency is linked to the purchase of it, always with hard assets or by algorithmic rules that enable people to earn Ven – by inviting friends to use it, for instance.  Oversight of reserves is managed in conjunction with our reserve banking partners, including HSBC, and via our currency board, (which) approve(s) any changes to the structure of the currency. We’re also working on an outside insurance policy review to provide additional assurances around Ven for our community.    SS: In the beginning, I think people were skeptical that we needed a virtual currency – especially in the financial industry. We spent a lot of time, effort and money developing the Ven ecosystem so the currency had an environment in which to trade. As Ven has grown, and the carbon advantages for the planet became apparent as we developed, people have become more enthusiastic about the potential for Ven, and can see how it fits in the large mix of things.  CD: The Ven is now indexed by Thomson Reuters. What does that mean?  SS: Since 2011, Thomson Reuters has calculated elements of the basket and published exchange rates relative to other currencies. This makes Ven available on Thomson Reuters terminals.  CD: How many organizations accept Ven? Who are they and why do they use it?  SS: We have thousands of people and organizations using Ven through the HubCulture.com stores, through supplier relationships and other activities. We’re working on functionality to extend Ven to third parties via plugins to ecommerce and the like, but there are some regulatory limitations to what we can do on exchange back out of Ven, and we need to make sure we follow a conservative approach with regard to these extensions.  CD: What’s the best story you’ve heard where Ven was used?  SS: My favorite is that we’ve been able to enable commodity trades using Ven, which provide a derivative carbon offset to the trade. This model sets a framework in place that could have a huge impact on commodity trading at scale, by embedding carbon offsets to trades and helping make the world a greener place.  CD: To what extent is Ven a novelty currency?  SS: Ven started out as a community currency for Hub Culture and has evolved into a viable solution for the financial world at large – especially around internet-linked transactions.  CD: How have you seen Ven used in a criminal sense?  SS: No. So far all Ven is transacting out through the stores, and large transactions are guided by our Knowledge Brokerage team, where KYC (“know-your-client”) and other research on the transaction is conducted. Since Ven is transparent, stable and resource-backed, it doesn’t have the same traits that make other virtual currencies attractive in these ways.  CD: What do you want to see happen with Ven?  SS: Ven operates at three levels – P2P, corporate and institutional. We would like to see members have the ability to trade Ven easily in the mobile environment and to be able to use it for a wide variety of activities. At the institutional level our ambition is to have 0.5% of global commodity trades priced in Ven. This would create enormous momentum for investment into carbon-related assets, which could single-handedly change the balance of power for clean energy and preservation of carbon-rich areas (forests, oceans, etc.).  CD: Various websites say you can buy carbon credits with Ven. How and why?  SS: You can – we offer a range of options related to carbon credits on our platform at HubCulture.com, from individual offset tonnage (where you can calculate your individual total footprint) to specific VER assets from partner projects, to funds that pool funding for placement with specific projects. The “why?” is simple – upward demand and financial support for environmental assets is one of the best ways to ensure they are protected. We curate relevant projects to make it easy for our community to access them. To see the range, visit http://hub.vg/CarbonAssets.  CD: Microfinance – what’s the story?  SS: Ven is a tremendous tool for microfinance because it divides easily and exchanges without friction, making it a perfect means of exchange at the microfinance level. We’ve been working to develop third-party partnerships in the microfinance sector to extend this to mobile transactions and to make sure that Hub Culture is supporting the right type of partners with Ven-related services.  CD:What is a “singular value”?  SS: Singular value is a concept first described by Stan Stalnaker in a TechCrunch article that examines the eventual relationship between the social graph, big data and monetary exchange. As data becomes pervasive and absolutely comparable, we will assign value to points on the graph, and they will eventually become exchangeable. Whether a proxy for a real-world asset or a digital point, once this exchange becomes available, it tends to negate the need for “currency”, because everything becomes effectively comparable and exchangeable in real time. Of course, currencies will still exist for ease of labeling but, in a way, many things will function as currency in this constantly comparing world of “singular value”.  CD: You were a first mover in digital currency. How do you think virtual currency will develop over the next decade?  SS: Hub Culture was one of the earliest players in the social network space and we all saw how large the category has become. I think the virtual currency sector will be as large (as) and maybe even more impactful than the social network sector and, in many ways they will intersect and be related. We’re in the center of these developments and happy to be innovating for our community in these areas.  CD: How do you feel about bitcoin and ripple now getting so much coverage even though Ven has been around a long time?  SS: Ven is very, very different from both bitcoin and ripple, and the systems all have great potential to function together to serve different needs. With the arrival of OpenCoin and other units of exchange, innovation in the space is set to accelerate, and it will be great to see how these elements work together. For instance, it won’t be long before virtual currency exchanges operate like current fiat currency exchanges, and I expect someday you’ll be seeing IPOs on virtual exchanges just like you see them today on the NYSE.  CD: Do you use bitcoins?  SS: I have purchased bitcoins several times but kept losing them early on! These days we manage bitcoin assets through Hub Culture and have developed assets in Ven that our community can access to hold bitcoin without all the hassle. In fact, we just launched a Ven Fund that allows users to hold both Ven and bitcoin together: http://hub.vg/btcven.  CD: What’s the future of Ven, given bitcoin is getting all the headlines?  SS: Ven is inherently stable, transparent and less liquid than bitcoin, so it feels very conservative in comparison. For almost six years we’ve been developing and innovating with Ven in a careful way, and we’d rather take that approach. Building a currency that has a positive social impact is key to our approach, even if it means sacrificing catchy headlines.  CD: Will you accept bitcoins or ripple?  SS: We’re working on some developments in that area, but have concerns about the KYC aspects of bitcoin related to full monetary exchange. We would prefer to keep Ven as squeaky clean as possible, and so full exchange from us is not likely to happen right away.  CD: How much do you make through Ven? Is the pricing transparent?  SS: We don’t actually make anything on Ven – and there is no pricing cost to us when acquiring or trading it. We make a margin on sale for goods and services through our stores, and it is through this that we are able to manage and maintain the currency for the benefit of others.  CD: How long does it take to transact – and do you make a profit on the transaction time?  SS: The average transaction takes less than a second, and about 30 seconds to complete from login to finish. We do not take a cut on transactions.  CD: If you could create Ven again today, what would you do differently?  SS: We are constantly innovating with Ven and developing new ways to extend Ven’s use for our members and the community. We are very focused on mobile right now and I just wish we had more funds to invest to make that move faster!  CD: Tell us something we don’t yet know about Ven. What are you planning?  SS: We have some big announcements coming in May that center around extending Ven to let organizations and users manage multiple accounts, and to request Ven payments from their friends. These functions will help to widen the use case for Ven. In addition we’re working on some exciting FDI (foreign direct investment) and environmental deals that will showcase the true potential for Ven within nation-states serious about protecting their environmental assets.
