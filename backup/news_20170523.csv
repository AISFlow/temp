42399912,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz7h3,1495577321,Consensus 2017: Decentralized Exchange 0x Wins Proof-of-Work Startup Competition,"0x (pronounced “zero-ex”) took the top prize today during the second annual Proof of Work pitch competition at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2017 conference in New York.  The startup is building a protocol to be used as a standard for the decentralized exchange of ERC20 tokens in the ethereum network. ERC20 tokens are a class of tokens that adhere to a set of standards dictating their implementation in ethereum-based smart contracts. As it stands today, virtually all tokens on the ethereum network now qualify as ERC20.  Will Warren, 0x's co-founder and CEO, made his pitch earlier this afternoon to Rumi Morales, the executive director CME Ventures; Dan Morehead, the CEO of Pantera; Brad Stephens, co-founder of Blockchain Capital; Matthew Roszak, co-founder of Bloq; and Lisa Cheng, a founder at Vanbex Group.  Decentralized token exchanges already exist on ethereum, but they are all incompatible with one another, Warren said during his pitch. The 0x protocol, he argued, is a building block that envisions a greater degree of interoperability between multiple applications.  0x's victory comes with a $10,000 check – along with the blessing of the panel of judges. The startup was one of six finalists to take part.

42399923,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz7nw,1495574281,Consensus 2017: Global Insurers Debate the Future of Prediction Markets,"Having a window into the future would make the job of an insurer a whole lot easier – and blockchain could make that possibility a bit more realistic.  The topic of blockchain-powered prediction markets and how the tech could help insurers like MetLife and reinsurers like Swiss Re was on display during CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 blockchain conference.  Swiss Re, for its part, is in the earliest stages of seeing how it can tap the ""wisdom of the crowds"" to help make the reinsurer operate more effectively.  Jags Rao, who serves as the Switzerland-based firm's blockchain workstream lead, conceded that such an application isn't going to happen in the short term – but that doesn't mean it's not on the firm's radar.  He said during the panel:  ""It's not in the next couple of years horizon, but it's important to be prepared because that’s where we as an insurance company can contribute knowledge that can help make that work.""  The idea of using prediction markets that let experts wager on future events based on their certainty of its outcome is also being explored blockchain startup Gem, which has partnered with healthcare tech firm Philips to research the potential benefits of blockchain for healthcare.  Siva Kannan, the company's VP of engineering, said that his team is also in the early stage of looking at the prediction market concept.  According to Kannan, if his company were to ever consider using data derived from a blockchain-based prediction market in a healthcare application, he'd be unlikely to do so with any organization funded by a token that didn't also play an active role in the functionality of the app itself.  ""We haven't explored it a lot,"" he said. ""We are definitely looking at the opportunities.""  Not everyone was onboard with the concept – at least for now, including the membership of distributed ledger consortium R3, which was represented by director Ryan Rugg.  Subhajit Mandal, MetLife's director of fintech innovation, also said his company wasn't currently looking into prediction markets.  Their reasoning: because those markets are generally reliant on publicly available information, and his firm's focus on life insurance means that the requisite data is tightly controlled.  Mandal said:  ""When it comes to personal health, that data will not be available.""  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Gem.

42399916,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz7i2,1495569640,'A-Ha Moment': Toyota Talks Vision For How Blockchain Could Change Driving,"Since joining the distributed ledger consortium R3 in 2016, Toyota has been quiet about its strategy for blockchain tech – but if its presence at CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 conference is any indication, that could soon change.  Announced yesterday exclusively at the conference, Toyota Research Institute (TRI) unveiled a three-pronged strategy that shows it believes blockchains will reshape interactions in the automotive supply chain.  The big reveal is bolstered by new details on months of behind-the-scenes work with partners including MIT Media Lab, BigchainDB, Commuterz, Gem and Oaken Innovations, all of whom are working with TRI on specific blockchain tech applications.  But going back further, though, Chris Ballinger, director of mobility services and chief financial officer at TRI, traces it all back to an ""a-ha moment"" that opened up his mind to the potential power of the technology and its possible applications for Toyota.  ""Everybody's journey has this common feature, they hear about it, they say how stupid, and then they meet someone who they respect and is smart and say maybe there's something more to this, and that they learn more,"" Ballinger said in a new interview.  Still, with a background as a monetary economist, Ballinger admits to being a bit predisposed to the idea that even the world's brightest minds can't quite offer a definition for money, why it functions and how the system of economics we have today came to be.  Ballinger told CoinDesk:  ""My a-ha moment was that people use lots of things for money, there's lots of things people say are near-monies. But basically in all those different types of money, there's only one that's a bearer instrument, and that's cash.""  Starting from the realization that bitcoin could eliminate financial middlemen, Ballinger said he became interested in exploring the idea of applying blockchain to new concepts.  ""The realization was the value was linked with the transaction, and this means that the transaction itself is a bearer instrument. And therefore all these problems tend to fall away, and it's all the other middlemen,"" he continued.  Still, while he's come to a similar insight as many startups and enterprises, Ballinger detailed a unique philosophy for applying it to the mobility sector – the word chosen not to limit the idea to personal vehicles, but encompassing many forms of mobilized transportation.  Not impressed  Elsewhere, Ballinger discussed his frustrations with the existing state of the blockchain industry, and what he described as an environment where real progress is often undermined by companies seeking publicity.  ""It's fairly easy to put an asset on a blockchain. But, people put out a press announcement that they've put greeting cards on a blockchain – so what?"" he remarked.  Rather, he voiced his belief that what will make blockchain work at scale is a collection of companies all supporting the network, a development he termed a ""minimum viable ecosystem"" – a homage to the ""minimal viable product"" philosophy.  ""The whole point of platform economics is that the network effect matters. The type of asset on the chain doesn't matter. More and more, the focus needs to turn to creating an ecosystem, and so I began to think about what does that mean for our industry, how do you create that work in an industry,"" he said.  In this way, Ballinger said TRI's big presence at Consensus 2017 was to showcase its work, create buzz and bring more attention to what it said were its lesser publicized applications.  Underutilized assets  Ballinger also put forward a vision suggesting a core belief: that the world's existing automotive fleets are an underutilized asset.  Blockchain technology, he said, opens up the idea for the sharing economy to extend to new networks, potentially creating opportunities for automobile owners – and for Toyota as a company – to rethink how it derives value.  ""The vehicles and the entire mobility infrastructure can be used more efficiently. It's hard to monetize your car. The empty seat in a car, it's pretty hard, the frictional information costs of doing that are prohibitive,"" he said.  In this way, he sees the broad economic benefits a car enables being broken off and split into distinct markets. Ballinger pointed to potential marketplaces for automotive data, with payments sent for the display of advertising or even to jump ahead of someone in traffic.  For now, however, he said the message from TRI is more modest.  Asked what he would like to say to those in the traditional transportation ecosystem, he said: ""Come join us.""  Ballinger went on to say:  ""The future of mobility is shared, connected and autonomous, and when you think about what technologies are needed for that world, you think of the infrastructure, the IoT-blockchain angle.""

42399905,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz5aC,1495560653,"Consensus 2017: CME Group, UK Royal Mint Detail Plans for Blockchain Gold","Derivatives giant CME Group and the UK's Royal Mint revealed details about their plans to bridge the worlds of gold and blockchain today at CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 conference in New York.  Last year, the two institutions announced plans to put gold on the blockchain to streamline trading, with physical gold being represented by tokens called RMGs (short for Royal Mint Gold). The Royal Mint said in April that it had begun testing the system.  Those involved with the initiative discussed plans to secure the digital assets that would be created in the new system. David Janczewski, head of new business and strategic intelligence at the Royal Mint, along with Sandra Ro, head of digitization at CME, talked about plans to store the funds in cold storage.  As Ro described, CME will be working with bitcoin startup BitGo to design the digital wallet that will store the RMG tokens. Additionally, Ro touched on the permissioned blockchain that CME is building.  ""We are building out some infrastructure, because we want this to trade. And we want to make this as frictionless as possible for our institutional clients,"" she said.  She went on to say that, when it comes time to issue the gold-backed tokens, that will be a responsibility held solely by the Royal Mint.  ""Only the Royal Mint will be authorized to issue tokens,"" she said. ""CME will have no role in that.""  CME is currently developing the platform on which the tokens will trade, according to Ro. That system is currently undergoing alpha testing, and the derivatives firm is working with a small group of clients to test it.  Ro explained:  ""Because this technology is so new, we are actually inviting those institutional clients to come on the journey with us to learn about digital asset trading, to learn about the blockchain. To learn about all of the aspects that a digital wallet will entail.""  As part of that process, CME has also partnered with AlphaPoint to build out a ""robust trading system"", according to Ro. And while she didn't offer a firm launch date, she indicated that more details on this front would be made public in the months ahead.  Ro said:  ""We will reveal more about launch date. You will hear more in next few months.""  Disclosure: CME Group is an investor in Digital Currency Group, of which CoinDesk is a subsidiary.

42399904,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz5bB,1495554779,"Consensus 2017: Smith, Voorhees Talk Today's Bitcoin Market Craze","When ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees and Blockchain CEO Peter Smith took the stage this morning at CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 conference, the title of their panel was already out of date.  ""Bitcoin Beyond $20 Billion: Digital Currency's Future,"" it read – but with bitcoin trading at close to $2300, the market cap of the currency is already $37 billion and climbing, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  During their appearance on the Consensus 2017 main stage today, both Smith and Voorhees shared their thoughts on why bitcoin is performing so well as an asset right now – and what we can expect from the future. The two perhaps have a unique vantage point to view the market: Voorhees runs a digital currency exchange while Smith leads one of the industry's longest-running wallet offerings.  For his part, Voorhees made the argument that market participants ought to brace themselves, and grow accustomed to a cycle of highs and lows.  ""People should expect bubbles with cryptocurrencies. They have been with us since the beginning of time and in crypto they are especially pronounced,"" he said.  But how high will it go? According to Smith, bitcoin has only two options: soar to great heights, or crash and burn.  He told the audience:  ""Bitcoin is a really huge idea. And really huge ideas only really work out if they end up being really huge. There's not a lot of midterm outcomes for an idea as big as bitcoin. And so for something like bitcoin if it's not growing constantly, if it isn't hitting highs, if we aren't constantly expanding the number of people that use it in the world, it probably has a serious problem.""  But why?  As might be expected, the topic of why the market is behaving the way it is emerged as a central conversation point.  Smith threw out a couple optimistic views. It could be an indication that the functionality and usability of the currency is finally built out in a way that encourages adoption. Or, he suggested, bitcoin may be experiencing a secondary lift from the money that has been being plowed into token sales.  Voorhees, on the other hand, refused to identify a single driver for the price.  ""Prices tend to move because hundreds of thousands or millions of actors are making millions of individual different decisions. And we don’t know what all those are. This is a complex system,"" he said.  Both, however, agreed that regulation will be one of the most determining factors that shape the extent to which bitcoin and the broader constellation of cryptocurrencies evolve.  Voorhees for his part, called for a hands-off regulatory stance, holding up the Internet as a somewhat idealized example of unfettered innovation.  ""[The internet's] only powerful and important because of the freedom it brought, because of how little it was touched by regulators. That was the best thing that happened to let the internet boom. And that's what I want to happen with bitcoin,"" said Voorhees, who also went on to dismiss the idea that anyone but billionaires could hold sway over regulators.  But if bitcoin is to deliver financial inclusion across diverse markets and cultures, regulators will necessarily have a role, argued Smith.  ""How do we get to a place where our industry is inclusive and creates better, freer markets for the whole world?"" he said, concluding:  ""I think to do that you're going to have to work with both regulators and policy makers.""

42399907,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz5d9,1495552515,Entrepreneur Vinny Lingham to Announce ICO at Consensus 2017,"Updated 23rd May, 2017: This article has been updated with additional details from Civic.      The CEO of blockchain identity platform Civic is expected to announce a forthcoming token sale this Thursday.  According to Vinny Lingham, founder of Civic and former CEO of mobile gift card platform Gyft, the reveal will be made during his talk today at CoinDesk's annual conference Consensus 2017, where he is set to unveil a new product that the tokens will seek to incentivize.  Civic plans to issue its tokens on the ethereum platform for the sale, though a final token will be issued on the RSK platform. Launched earlier this week at Consensus 2017, the platform aims to enable smart contracts on top of bitcoin. (Civic uses the bitcoin blockchain to store hashes it uses for its identity attestation services.)  Civic tokens will provide access to the product and allow token holders participants to benefit from its network effect, he said. Overall, Civic plans to raise $33m by selling 330 million out of 1 billion outstanding tokens, which would make it the highest-earning token sale ever. The rest of the tokens will be allocated to enterprise partners and developers.  Lingham is now working with law firm Perkins Coie, Tokenmarket.net and the Argon Group to launch the sale, which is expected to take place during the first week of June.  Founded in 2016, Civic raised $2.75m last year at launch. A white paper detailing the tokens is to be released soon.

42399892,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz5RL,1495548452,"Fidelity CEO Talks 'Love' For Bitcoin, Why Blockchain Will 'Change' Markets","The CEO of one of the largest private companies in the US is in love.  At Consensus 2017 today, Abigail Johnson, chair and CEO of Fidelity Investments, went public with her enthusiasm for blockchain technology, bitcoin, ethereum and what the future holds for both open-source, public blockchains and more private alternatives.  In her talk, Johnson discussed the ""future scenario"" where blockchain technologies have thrived, remarking that she thinks this has a ""reasonable chance"" of coming to pass despite the relative newness of the technology.  Elsewhere, she argued how collaboration is needed to overcome this unfamiliarity with the technology and help it reach its ""full potential"".  ""This transformation could complement lots of other innovative areas that we see emerging – including the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence. These platforms shouldn't develop in a vacuum,"" she said.  Johnson went on to tell attendees:  ""Part of the reason I am here is to ask this community to help us address some of the hurdles that we see. And there are several that are holding back the adoption of this technology. We want to get after these hurdles – but we can’t do this alone – we need to work together.""  Johnson also revealed information about her company's partners on its journey, naming blockchain startup Axoni, investment firm Boost VC and university initiatives based out of MIT, University College London and Cornell.  To date, Johnson explained that Fidelity Labs, its internal R&D division has also set up experiments for bitcoin micropayments and even run bitcoin and ethereum mining operations in the spirit of learning more about the technology.  Further, she revealed that Fidelity will be taking some conservative steps to expose Fidelity's customers more to the industry, announcing that customers will soon be able to see Coinbase holdings on Fidelity.com. Already, she said, this feature is available to employees who own digital currencies available through the startup's services.  Speaking to this coming together of both existing finance and startups, Johnson said:  ""The internet wasn't just a more efficient way to send letters – it spawned new industries. Blockchain technology isn't just a more efficient way to settle securities – it will fundamentally change market structures – and maybe even the architecture of the internet itself.""  New research  Johnson further detailed Fidelity's research strategy for blockchain, noting the education difficulties that have thus far made adoption difficult.  She said that, at this stage, most potential users attempt to compare it to older technologies, or they simply never adopt due to the time and patience it takes to master new concepts such as having passwords for money.  ""Some users treated the recovery phrase like a password. They also expected to be able to click a 'Forgot My Password' button if they ever lost it – definitely not the ideal mental model,"" she said.  Johnson also spoke to the larger ideological changes that have happened as the world has begun to better understand open, public blockchain technology, and how that is reshaping how industries are seeking to apply it to business models.  ""If you are looking for bitcoin to beat Visa at the point-of-sale today, you are going to be disappointed,"" she remarked.  Three problems  Johnson's talk also covered other problems in how blockchain technology is being applied in the enterprise – specifically, regulation, scalability and privacy.  ""Regulators will go through the same growing pains. And, in order for this technology to reach its true potential, we need solutions that protect customer interests,"" she said.  Notably, Johnson also addressed that her passion for open-source blockchain technologies is also hitting governance roadblocks that limit their utility for enterprises.  ""Companies that build products on these platforms don’t have clarity about the future path they might take – or how to influence these communities,"" she said.  Still, she cautioned that the traditional financial world – despite its consortiums – hasn't quite figured it out either, remarking:  ""Control is also an issue for private networks. The financial services industry will need to work to understand the risks associated with who controls key features of these systems.""

42399895,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz5TJ,1495544627,Bitt Reveals Big Plans for Cross-Caribbean Blockchain Settlement Network,"For Barbados-based blockchain startup Bitt, creating a Caribbean-wide settlement network is a challenge that will be fraught with legal, technical and social challenges. However, thanks to a new partnership with Netki, one hurdle may have just gotten easier.  Announced today at Consensus 2017, Bitt revealed it will use identity tools developed by California blockchain startup Netki to improve and automate its customer onboarding.  While it may sound like a small step, according to Bitt co-founder Oliver Gale, the upgrade will serve to advance a larger bid to connect regional central banks and commercial banks using digital fiat currencies and blockchain tech as a new kind of payment rail.  ""Across more than 7,000 islands, the Caribbean has 13 sovereign island nations and 12 dependent territories, most with their own financial system and currency,"" a press release from the companies explains.  Bitt revealed it is already working with the Central Bank of Barbados on ""pilot initiatives"" behind the concept. (The Central Bank of Barbados declined to comment, but will be speaking later at Consensus 2017 today).  Gale told CoinDesk:  ""We're offering Bitt as a payment network. The vision is connecting the Caribbean with a settlement network.""  In this way, Gale framed the solution for conducting AML and identity on a public blockchain as one that would enable it to take this concept ""to the next tier"", satisfying concerns that a open digital currency network wouldn't normally include identity features natively.  For Netki, the announcement also marks a major product milestone, serving as an extension of a digital identity standard it first made public at Consensus 2016 last year. At the time, it likened the service to the certificate authorities that today provide trusted transactions in online commerce transactions.  As such, Netki CEO Justin Newton explained to CoinDesk that the partnership serves to highlight the work it is doing to bring blockchain to the enterprise.  ""One of the reasons that I think the partnership we have with Bitt will be so successful is that it is addressing these digital identity with open standards. Using an open, permissionless network gives them the most flexibility for the future,"" he said.  Public-private design  As put forward by Bitt, the partnership is one that finds it seeking to solve real-world challenges with blockchain tech, in a way that builds on its past work and helps position it as a licensed financial institution that can solve big regional challenges.  Specifically, this news builds on a 2016 announcement that Bitt would launch a digital Barbadian dollar on the blockchain in partnership with blockchain startup Colu.  The idea is that the cryptocurrency would be pegged to real, government-backed currency, which could then be sent between peers with the freedoms similar to what bitcoin today provides its global user base.  Gale concluded:  ""The end-game solution is that central banks will be able to use legal tender issued on the blockchain, with all the checks and balances you'd have with regulated financial institutions.""

42399901,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz5WG,1495543941,"Blockstack Releases Blockchain-Powered, Tokenized Internet Browser","Blockchain startup Blockstack has released a decentralized browser aimed at making apps more easily accessible.  In a way, the release is a kind of Netscape for the decentralized internet, running apps on a plethora of blockchains.  But news of the browser's release, revealed today at CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 blockchain conference in New York, represents just a piece of the progress made by the venture funded startup. Blockstack, the New York-based firm that has raised over $5m to date, is expected to release a full developer stack aimed at letting coders build apps in much the same way that Apple facilitates its own app development.  How Blockstack plans to power that ecosystem is perhaps just as intriguing.  The startup is revealing plans for what might be considered a kind of initial coin offering, or ICO, using its own technology that sits on top of several other blockchains.  Blockstack co-founder Ryan Shea positioned the series of announcements as the symbolic beginning of a new internet as decentralized as the blockchains it supports, including bitcoin, ethereum and zcash.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We built it in such a way that it will outlive us and any of the participants in the network. This is the idea behind the design of the Internet and the Web, it's something that could be a public resource that can live on, that it can be something that the people can use and maintain.""  Blockchain browser  In many ways, the browser is the core of Blockstack's suite of decentralized internet tools.  Built over the course of more than two years, the browser was built from the ground up with developers in mind.  As part of an industry wide effort to make blockchain applications that are actually serving real problems Blockstack aimed to reduce the complexity of building with blockchain. To get there, the startup hid the more complicated aspects of the technology behind a sleek user interface.  Part dashboard, part app store, the browser is designed to give users a seamless browsing experience by granting access to websites via a single identity login that — unlike profiles created on the traditional internet — they actually own.  ""It allows you to run decentralized applications directly on your device,"" said Shea. ""And it allows you to plug into identity and data storage that you can control.""  Path to token launch  Founded in 2013 as blockchain identity startup Onename, the firm has raised capital from a number of major players, including Union Square Ventures, Angel List founder Naval Ravikant, and Digital Currency Group.  The startup's past success in registering more than 70k domains on its decentralized internet has laid the foundation for what could end up being significant developer interest. And while the ""entire system is free to open,"" said Shea, it is designed to rely on scarce resources with the potential to accumulate value in their own right.  After initially being built using the Namecoin blockchain, the company switched to bitcoin and now supports ethereum and zcash as well.  But in order to create a fully integrated browser experience, Blockstack leverages what it calls a Virtualchain that sits above the other blockchains.  Which is where the yet-to-be-named Blockstack token, revealed today, is likely to come into play.  A new kind of crypto-token  Similar to how domains are today registered for a fee on the internet, the new token will be used to file the registration fees paid directly to the network.  Though technical details about the distribution model and other aspects of the token have yet to be settled, Ali and Shea emphasized this is not an ethereum-based ICO, but rather the sale of tokens created by their own technology.  ""Currently, we're launching a single token for Blockstack,"" said Ali. ""And we'll have more details on app-specific tokens later.""  The Blockstack token itself only grants access to the digital property associated with it and, for the time being, the plan is that the tokens will be destroyed when they are converted into a digital property, such as a domain name.  The founders say the tokens will not function like ethereum's gas, which gives the user access to the network's computing resources.  According to Shea, the token needed to be separate from the systems they support in the event of any major changes, like the recent ethereum hard fork.  The approach also helps the startup avoid some of the scaling difficulties experienced by the bitcoin network and others.  ""We want a token at this layer two level, where Blockstack logic operates,"" said Ali. ""So that if something happens to the blockchains underneath people will not notice that something catastrophic has happened and the system keeps living.""

42399900,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz5YE,1495542716,Distributed Ledger Consortium R3 Closes Record $107 Million Funding Round,"Global banking consortium R3 has closed the largest funding round in the history of distributed ledger technology.  Revealed today at Consensus 2017, over 40 financial institutions participated in the $107m round, including top member investors SBI Group, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and HSBC. Additional major investors include ING, Banco Bradesco, Itaú Unibanco, Natixis, Barclays, UBS and Wells Fargo, plus more from around the globe.  The funds are expected to be deployed as part of plans for global technological development and, eventually, a push to bring what the firm calls Corda Enterprise to institutions around the world.  R3's founder and CEO, David Rutter, told CoinDesk:  ""We're ridiculously excited that this massive group of competing financial institutions could be so excited about what we’re building, to look beyond the competitive nature of the industry and the personalities that were involved, and really rally around a common theme.""  Notably, the announced funding comprises only the first two tranches of a Series A round, which was opened primarily to firms who were among the R3's initial members. A third tranche, planned for later this year, will be open to other members and entities outside the consortium, meaning the final amount of the Series A will likely be even larger.  The round did include two strategic investors that are not members of R3: computing giant Intel and the private equity branch of Singapore government-owned Temasek Holdings, an investment firm with $242bn on its portfolio.  The major investment could be seen as a sign of confidence from the banking industry in R3’s distributed ledger model, which was designed from the ground up to give the banks originally threatened by blockchain a way to capitalize on the benefits of the technology, while maintaining or advancing their market position.  Global spread  Details about the share structure are not being disclosed, neither are details about the division of the intellectual property built atop the open-source Corda platform. However, Rutter did explain that while Corda itself is being open-sourced, the results of experiments conducted with partners within the R3 lab would be guarded more closely.  The investment participants themselves largely mirrored the initial recruitment push in 2015 that saw a global geographic spread of members, with investors consisting of banks split between Asia, Europe and the Americas.  Going forward, the firm intends to build on its more than 110 employees working in nine offices around the world by both hiring new talent and opening new locations. Specifically, the firm will be using part of the investment money to develop Corda Enterprise, a paid-for version of Corda with additional features for regulated institutions.  ""We will license a Corda Enterprise,"" said Rutter. ""Which will come with service contracts and throughput and latency guarantees that wouldn’t otherwise be available through Corda open source.""  Prior to the closing of the first two tranches of the round, Rutter said R3 was supported by membership fees from approximately 80 members that paid between $240,000 and $500,000, with free membership provided for regulators. New members are expected to continue to be added, providing additional revenue.  Rutter said:  ""We tried to achieve a balance from a geographical perspective, but also to balance out the investments so that no particular firm had an outsized influence over R3. [That way] we can continue to move very quickly and continue to roll out solutions.""  Missed target  While the investment is the largest single round in the brief history of distributed ledger tech, it was reportedly originally much higher.  In May of last year, Financial News reported that R3 was raising a $200m round, which would have dwarfed the $60m investment raised by competitor Digital Asset. By the end of last year, that number had dropped to $150m, following the departure of founding members Goldman Sachs and Santander.  In an exclusive interview with CoinDesk earlier this year, Rutter confirmed the round would still be what he called ""the largest round in the industry"", adding that it would close by the end of this quarter.  Then, last month the much-rumored exit of a third high-profile member, JPMorgan, was confirmed – a departure that helped define the borders between the different models seeking to bring the efficiency and accountability of using a shared distributed ledger to the banking industry.  ""Banks and other financial firms that are going to process trillions of dollars of notional value across a network need a very high level of service level agreement,"" said Rutter.  A different model  As R3 has developed since it launched in 2015, it has helped define a series of distributed ledger consortia vying for the right to help define the future of finance.  While companies like Ripple and Axoni are creating custom solutions internally and bringing together small groups of banks for different trials, and industry agnostic platforms like Hyperledger work on a variety of business solutions using blockchain, JPMorgan released its own Quorum solution, which has become a central component of the recently launched Enterprise Ethereum Alliance.  By contrast, Rutter focuses on the fact that Corda was built from the ground up specifically for banks, but R3 is not itself a bank. This, he hopes, could give the members a sense of ease.  ""We’ve kind of proven to a degree that we’ve never seen before that the collaborative model works very well,"" he said.  Earlier this month, Japanese bank Mizuho announced that it has hired consultancy firm Cognizant to build a platform using Corda, and in April, investment software firm Calypso revealed it was working with ING, BBVA and three others to build a trade-matching service on the platform.  Mincing no words about the media’s focus on the departures compared to the overall cooperation the investment round evinces, Rutter said:  ""It’s been slightly annoying that we have such a massively successful, unprecedented group of investors and members that have come together to build something in a collaborative manner that hasn’t been done before and instead people have focused on one or two banks here and there.""

42399902,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz5ZD,1495540802,"Consensus 2017 Day 1 Recap: Collaboration, Education and Patience","It's about balance and breadth.  The panels at Consensus 2017 yesterday touched a wide range of topics, from global issues down to the integration of blockchain and IoT. But in spite of the diversity of panels and panelists, common themes started to emerge.  The opening panel, ""Going Global"", not only echoed the notable international presence amongst speakers and attendees, it also reflected blockchain's spread across ecosystems and geographical areas. Panels on cross-border payments, trade finance, global issues and others highlighted the expansion beyond all types of boundaries, not just political.  Feed the ecosystem  Many panelists spoke of the need to think beyond 'silos', or environments that lack outside communication and collaboration.  Niall McCann, lead electoral advisor at the UN Development Programme (UNDP), pointed out that even departments in large, global organizations end up working in silos, which slows down innovation. Other panelists echoed the call for increased communication, between departments, organizations and even sectors.  Blockchains weren't immune from this idea of connection, either. Joseph Lubin of ConsenSys commented on the blurring of boundaries between the public and private versions of ethereum, as businesses building on private adaptations add public integration to their roadmaps.  Part of the problem is education. Elizabeth Rossiello, CEO of cross-border bitcoin startup BitPesa commented that one of the big barriers to growth over the past few years has been a lack of familiarity with how blockchain technology works.  In the ""Global Issues"" session, moderator Jesse McWaters of the World Economic Forum asked the panel how they get ""buy in"" for their ideas. The consensus was that a significant barrier is the lack of manager familiarity with the concept.  Education not only works up and down departmental chains, but also across sectors. Peteris Zilgalvis of the European Parliament stressed on the ""Going Global"" panel that one of the building blocks of the fintech task force he co-chairs was to learn from blockchain businesses and consumers.  Patience, patience  Given the atmosphere of heightened expectations in the three packed ballrooms in which the presentations were being held, the level of restraint exhibited by many of the panelists was notable.  Houman Haddad, financial officer at the UN's World Food Programme, summed it up when he said:  ""Anything that’s new and untested is not easy to implement.""  Add to that the understanding that we're no longer talking about ideas but real-world applications, some of which involve not only economic chains but also political systems and humanitarian issues, and the need to be careful becomes imperative.  As Rose Chan, ‎digital economist at the World Bank pointed out: ""We have to get it right.""  Chan observed that the role of blockchain leads in large global organizations has evolved to become part evangelist and part gatekeeper – a delicate balance that is becoming increasingly important as ecosystems grow.  Several panelists were speaking for the first time about the barriers to blockchain implementation. The confidence gathered through real-world projects is, on the whole, encouraging more experimentation, but a growing awareness that blockchain is ""not easy"" added a dose of realism to the talks.  Most speakers concurred that, while the potential is intriguing, full-scale rollout of real-world applications will take time. Collaboration across ecosystems is key. And so is patience.  Nick Giurietto, CEO and managing director of the Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association (ADCCA), pointed out that patience is necessary to build trust with the regulators.  Other panelists echoed that it was also fundamental for building trust vertically within organizations. Some, however, highlighted the pressure from external forces – political and economic – to accelerate the implementation of blockchain innovation and efficiencies.  As if to underline the conflicting understandings that: 1) reform is urgently needed in many sectors, but 2) such a complicated and systemic change needs to evolve over time, Vincent Wang of the China Wanxiang Group drew a round of applause when he said:  ""China is known for strategic patience when it comes to both democracy and economic policy. In the meantime, when we talk about our progress … we will not test people's patience.""

42399899,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz5XF,1495537203,Consensus 2017: Blockchain Tech Leaders Predict Interoperable Future,"Leaders of four different blockchain and distributed ledger projects believe they are collectively working on what could end up being an interoperable network of services.  Speaking onstage at CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 conference in New York, ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, bitcoin scientist Adam Back, Hyperledger executive director Brian Behlendorf and Richard Gendal Brown of distributed ledger consortium R3 took turns talking about the future of their industry.  While philosophies differed regarding public and private blockchains, and methods of development, a consensus was largely formed that, eventually, their technologies will probably directly interact in the future.  Lubin, who is also the co-founder of ethereum development firm ConsenSys, told the audience:  ""All of these individuals on stage with us are all building technologies with which we would someday like to interoperate.""  Still, Lubin described ethereum as the only ""powerful blockchain system that can operate in a private permissioned context or a public context"".  However, Back – the inventor of early cryptocurrency, hashcash – is working with Blockstream to introduce features to the public bitcoin blockchain that would give it certain privacy traits that might make it more attractive to regulated enterprise.  One of the most significant obstacles to be overcome in the creation of this interoperable mesh of blockchains, he argued, would be the preservation of what makes each chain unique, even as value moves from one to the other.  ""I think interoperability is going to be important,"" said Back. ""And its important for the trust properties of the chain to transfer.""  While the Lubin indicated that ConsenSys is working on an ""interledger"" capable of facilitating such interoperability, Hyperledger's Behlendorf proposed a different possibility: that what might end up connecting these blockchains would be an identity solution that lets users own their own profiles.  That statement is notable as, earlier this month, Hyperledger revealed plans for an effort called Project Indy to do exactly that, though Behlendorf didn't make explicit the possibility that the solution might play a role in blockchain interoperability.  ""These things will be richly woven together,"" he said.  As evidence of the interconnected nature of the global exchange of value, R3's Gendal Brown described the early days of his consortium's work with global banks.  What began as an effort to solve the problem of how global financial institutions can transact with each other with greater trust has ended up moving towards a tool for establishing trust in other industries, including insurance.  Brown said:  ""When we started designing Corda, we set out to build a platform that can bring the benefits of DLT to finance. The upshot is that its much more general.""

42399893,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz5SK,1495533612,Consensus 2017: People and Machine Problems – Solved with Blockchain?,"On a global scale, blockchain solutions are being sought to tackle the word's most pressing problems, everything from identity to financial services for the unbanked, and even world hunger.  But on panels discussing those very issues at CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 conference, it became clear that these were complex problems that would take a long time to sort out. Several panelists put out a call for more data – not simply on blockchain solutions that are working, but those that aren't, too.  Surprisingly, obtaining the latter was more difficult.  ""This is a nascent field, and the startups in the space are tight-lipped about failures,"" said Mike Pisa, policy fellow at Center for Global Development, a US think tank focused on international development.  Rose Chan, founder of World Bank's blockchain working group, agreed with his sentiment, telling the audience:  ""We need more data, we need more pilots and more trials. It is better for the entire ecosystem to be honest about what is not working.""  And, as some pointed out, even blockchain has its limitations.  As Niall McCann, lead electoral advisor at United Nations Development Programme, remarked, there are good reasons why some programs do not succeed.  ""We are operating in countries where having enough electricity in a mountain village is challenging,"" he said. ""Often, we are dealing with problems that cannot be solved by technology.""  Formulating identity  Speaking of global problems, worldwide, some 2.4 billion people do not have a formal identity, keeping them from becoming part of the global economy. But even for those who do have formal identities, the current centralized systems that manage those identities are cumbersome at best.  For example, most of us have fragmented identities spread out across numerous apps, like Facebook or LinkedIn, or connected to physical documents, like passports and birth certificates. Reputations systems are equally split up.  The hope is that blockchain could be a way to tie all of that together.  ""The vision here is that the user gets to create their own identity core,"" explained Ryan Shea, co-founder of Blockstack, a company focused on building a decentralized internet. ""And then instead of Uber locking up their ratings about you in their system, it gets attached to your identity core.""  That all sounds well and good, but for many, putting personal information on a blockchain may sound daunting.  Drummond Reed, chief trust officer of Evernym, a company building an identity network on a permissioned ledger, argued that people’s fears about privacy are unwarranted, saying:  ""You do not put private data on the chain. You put public data on the chain.""  Machines and money  Identity doesn't just extend to humans, but also devices. On a different panel, several experts came together to discuss the future of blockchain and the Internet of Things (IoT).  Interestingly, the discussion quickly veered into how to tokenize money, so that machines can not only communicate and interact, but also transact.  Julio Faura, head of R&D Santander pointed out that with tokens, it is possible to place value much closer to IoT devices.  He said:  ""We are working on ways to represent fiat values as tokens. You send money to a bank account, and blockchain will issue a token. You segregate funds for the clients, machines, devices, whatever you want. Those tokens are not subject to market volatility, they are just recourse against fiat value.""  When asked if he thought that Santander would put a fiat-backed token on the blockchain, Faura responded: ""Yes, we are working on that.""  ""Of course it is easier to work with private implementations,"" he continued. ""[L]ater on we can progress to larger permissioned blockchain, where you have many other corporate users. But we have to go one step at a time.""  Dominik Schiener, co-founder of IOTA, a non-profit organization working on a distributed ledger technology for IoT, said: ""The way we see banks, is like on- and off-ramping for the fiat tokens.""  But others on the panel were cautious about moving too fast in that direction.  Allison Clift Jennings, CEO and co-founder of Filament, a decentralized IoT solution that enables devices to hold unique identities on a public ledger, explained that her company's typical customer is a Fortune 1000 company.  ""Tokenization is a little strange for them in a IoT of situations,"" she said, suggesting that there needs to be a hybrid approach to arrive at viable solutions.  Jennings told the crowd:  ""We need to help guide them – hold their hand, really – as they get comfortable with this brave new world.""

42399898,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz5PN,1495530058,Consensus 2017: The Legality of ICOs – Past and Future,"Call them token sales. Call them ICOs. Call them what you will, but they are all the rage right now in the blockchain space.  Consequently, they were what was on everyone's mind and smartphone yesterday at CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 conference in New York.  For those who are new to the concept, token sales are emerging as a way for blockchain startups to turbocharge their bankrolls by issuing an asset specific to an application that either lives on a more generalized blockchain (such as the sale of Gnosis tokens on the ethereum blockchain) or exists as its own stand alone blockchain (such as the sale of forthcoming Tezos token).  But into what legal realm do these sales fall? And are companies that chose to take the token sale route simply making themselves and everyone else in the space vulnerable to a regulatory crackdown?  These were the questions that dominated a panel of legal experts yesterday afternoon.  The main thing these companies want to avoid is creating and selling a token that acts as a security, according to Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at cryptocurrency advocacy group Coin Center. However, he argued many are stumbling right out the gate simply by referring to their sales as ""ICOs"" (short for initial coin offerings).  Van Valkenburgh told the audience:  ""It's like painting a target on yourself. Because, what does an organization like the SEC regulate? They regulate IPOs. That's what they regulate. So, let's just change one letter and make it a 'C' and then it's OK, right? No. Why would you adopt the terminology of the regulator when you’re building a thing you hope they don't regulate?""  Defining a phenomenon  If you disregard the nuances of the terminology, specifying what falls in the category of a security is actually still quite complex, and this debate inspired lively conversation among the panelists.  All seemed to agree that one of the most important factors in determining whether a token offering falls into the category of a security is the extent to which its utility overshadows its potential as an investment. Ether, for example, is not only a tradeable commodity, it's also a functional token on the ethereum network, one that a user must own and spend to trigger the execution of smart contracts on the platform.  But if tokens are sold before a product even exists, as has been the case with many of the most high-profile sales, it is especially difficult to argue that it has utility.  Thomas Linder, a partner at MME, a law firm based in Zurich, floated the possibility that in some cases these tokens could be interpreted as donations or as licenses granted to the buyer for future use on the platform from which they sprang. Meanwhile, Van Valkenburgh likened pre-sales to crowd funding mechanisms such as Kickstarter and argued that legal contracts stipulating the intended utility of the tokens could help nudge them out of the security zone.  The skeptics  However, Preston Byrne, COO of distributed ledger startup and Hyperledger contributor Monax, was unconvinced, to put it lightly. His company, formerly known as Eris Industries, specializes in smart contracts that it bills as tailored specifically with the law in mind.  ""That's complete nonsense,"" he said of the idea a crypto crowdsale could be a donation. ""Everybody knows that what this is in substance and in form is the sale of investments which people are purchasing with the expectation of profit at a later date.""  Nor can the majority of the tokens on the market be compared to the rewards from a Kickstarter campaign, according to Byrne.  Referring to a digital currency exchange known for its frequency of new crypto coin listings, he said:  ""I don’t buy a pair of sneakers with the expectation that I'm going to list it on Poloniex.""  Action ahead?  Both Van Valkenburgh and Byrne, who have jousted frequently and ardently over this issue on social media, expect regulators to eventually crack down. And both imagined the crackdown to roll out in a way that's reminiscent of the days of Napster when individual file sharers were targeted to set an example for the community.  When asked what the best practices would be for a startup that is considering offering a token sale, the two opponents fell back into their trenches.  ""The token shouldn't be about profit sharing,"" said Van Valkenburgh.  Meanwhile Byrne argued that the best way to be compliant in a token sale is not to have one at all. ""I'd say, don't do an ICO. Go call up Norton Rose or Allen & Overy and get them to do a securities issuance and use the blockchain as your back end,"" he said.  This approach may not only keep people out of jail, it's also probably the best way to encourage regulators to consider making the changes that would pave the way for unequivocally legal token sales.  ""Regulation is going in this direction. It’s heading toward more crowdfunding and making more investor products available to people who can’t actually earn anything when they put their money in a bank,"" said Byrne. ""You have to start from a position of compliance.""  Counter-arguments  Still, innovators are undeterred.  In a presentation earlier in the day, Juan Benet, the founder and CEO of Protocol Labs, lamented the regulatory uncertainty surrounding the sale of blockchain tokens and credited it with a brain drain in the US.  ""There's an enormous amount of innovation here in technology. And what I see lagging is that the best teams in blockchain tech are moving overseas,"" said Benet. ""And so, I think we need to solve this once and for all for the entire ecosystem and have a good way of getting projects started here.""  To that end, Protocol Labs is working on a project intended to devise a standard procedure for companies to follow when carrying out token sales, one that will keep them compliant with US regulations. The effort will focus on the riskiest type of token sale, those which are initiated before a product exists.  The project is called SAFT, a reference to the yCombinator funding documents, SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) which inspired it.
