42429586,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzpFh,1535144435,What an SEC Bitcoin ETF Rejection Review Really Means,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced Thursday that nine bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) disapproval orders are to be stayed until further review.  Referencing Rule 431 of the Commission's Rules of Practice, the SEC said in a series of letters that it would reconsider the three rejections made by the U.S. regulator's staff.  But what does it mean when the Commission says it will ""review"" the disapproval orders? And what implications does that decision have for the proposed bitcoin ETFs themselves?  According to the Rules of Practice, the Commission may effectively ""affirm, reverse, modify, set aside or remand for further proceedings, in whole or in part,"" which technically means the end of this batch of bitcoin ETFs is not final.  Jake Chervinsky, a defense and litigation lawyer for Kobre and Kim LLP, told CoinDesk the petition for review was likely ""initiated by a member of the Commission"" as no indication on the SEC's web page points to action taken by either of the two exchanges responsible for the ETF filings – the Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  In effect, it only takes the vote of one Commission member to start a petition for review, and as indicated in the Rules of Practice, once granted, ""the Commission shall set forth the time within which any party or other person may file a statement in support of or in opposition to the action made by delegated authority.""  With further commenting underway, as Chervinsky points out, the specific body responsible for gathering the additional information and ultimately setting the record straight is now the three SEC commissioners and Chairman Jay Clayton.  And, perhaps most notably, the SEC leadership only just recently issued a decision following a separate review of a past bitcoin ETF rejection for the proposal by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.  Past example  The Winklevoss bitcoin ETF was denied initially in March of last year, seemingly ending a multi-year effort to create a ""physically"" backed bitcoin fund into which investors could buy stakes.  After the SEC's staff pushed back against the idea, the Bats BZX exchange, which filed the proposed rule change allowing for the bitcoin ETF, petitioned for a review.  More than a year after the review began the SEC's commissioners came to the decision that the ruling to disapprove would not be overturned, affirming ""BZX has not met its burden under the Exchange Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice to demonstrate its proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act Section 6(b)(5).""  At the time, Commissioner Hester Peirce wrote a letter of dissent disagreeing with the outcome of the review.  Her arguments – that the SEC should be focused on disclosure rather than playing ""gatekeeper"" to the market – will likely be raised again during deliberations on the current set of bitcoin ETF proposals put forth by Direxion, GraniteShares and ProShares.  Past reviews have taken anywhere between six to 16 months, Chervinsky affirmed, and the Rules of Practice do not set a strict deadline for the SEC, making it ""hard to predict"" how long this particular review will take.  Chervinsky told CoinDesk:  ""Given the nature of yesterday's decision and the fact that the commissioners so recently handled the Winklevoss appeal, I don't think it will take long to finish this review.""  Regardless, the announcement of the review was largely well-received by individuals such as GraniteShares CEO Will Rhind, whose firm is now among those waiting for a final answer from the SEC's highest ranks.  ""It's a positive development and we look forward to engaging with the SEC commissioners on this matter,"" Rhind told CoinDesk.

42429579,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzp1h,1535135711,Ethereum Meeting Leaves Open Questions Ahead of October Upgrade,"A meeting that brought together a broad representation of ethereum stakeholders to discuss code changes on which decisions need to be made ahead of a software upgrade scheduled for October, failed to produce immediate results Friday.  The bi-weekly developers call, which this week included a majority of the network's miners and some prominent investors, had the goal of forging consensus on changes to ethereum's underlying economics, the speed of its upgrades and the mining methods it supports, as well as establishing an order in which concerns might be addressed through future upgrades.  However, despite nearly two hours of dialogue, the meeting ended with the resolution that the discussion continue, with a follow-on meeting scheduled for August 31.  Adding necessity to the talks is that the so-called ""difficulty bomb,"" a piece of code that, in seeking to encourage quicker updates to the protocol, must be delayed or removed.  The presence of the deadline, set for early 2019, has complicated the question of whether to implement a proof-of-work change to remove specialized mining hardware, or ASICs, from the platform, whether its rewards are being distributed fairly, and whether such changes should be made together.  But, since miners, developers and investors are all impacted – some could gain or lose money, depending on the decision – the conversation might be best seen as a difficult first step in making such choices.  Chairman of the discussion Hudson Jameson said:  ""I honestly don't know how to make a decision. I don't know how we'll go from here.""  Issuance debated  A lack of firm decision-making aside, significant time was spent discussing how much ether is created and distributed with every transaction block that is mined.  Two participants in the call – Brian Venturo, CTO of mining facility operator Atlantic Crypto, and software developer Matthew White – called not only for an issuance reduction, but went as far as asking developers to commit to limiting the total amount of ether that can ever be created.  That move would deviate from previous roadmaps, in which a cap wouldn't be added until an anticipated change to a proof-of-stake consensus method that would remove the need for mining hardware entirely.  Others sought to frame the question as one that is in the interests of all parties who use ether – even developers who may not necessarily earn rewards.  ""Getting the issuance under control will have good effects for price which is important for developer salaries and projects and funding new projects,"" White said.  Speaking at the meeting, Xin Xu, the CEO of an ethereum mining pool named Sparkpool that supports over 20 percent of the ethereum hashrate, warned about the consequences of lowering the issuance rate or block reward too substantially.  ""There is a tipping point and when we get there everything will break down and we cannot get back. In my opinion the change of issuance will be a big impact to the security."" Xin said.  ASIC resistance  And even though ethereum's proof-of-work mining is expected to be replaced later in the roadmap, stakeholders faced another contentious topic: whether to block the use of specialized chips that could crowd out many of today's GPU-dependent miners.  At issue is the recent release of specialized ASICs designed to maximize miner profits and push out those who have less-competitive miners – or are unable to buy the latest hardware.  Given that the issuance reduction would effectively amount to a cut in pay for miners, ethereum developer Danny Ryan suggested that blocking ASICs from the network might constitute a ""reasonable compromise"" for GPU-dependent miners.  Jameson said that such a code change could be implemented in a subsequent hard fork, eight months after Constantinople has activated — however, the testing required might be too substantial for it to be included in October's planned hard fork.  And while there was broad consensus from the miners present to keep ASICs off the platform, several developers pushed back against the code change proposal, stating that they were ""skeptical"" that it could accomplish its aims.  Others warned that a change that is too substantial could actually be damaging to GPU miners, who have optimized their equipment for ethereum's code.  In the end, Jameson urged participants to continue the discussion on social media, remarking:  ""Between now and next Friday there will be more community comment about the EIPs and the different perspectives here.""

42429593,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzpVh,1535128217,Bitcoin Price Could End Day With Tightest Trading Range of 2018,"UPDATE (20:00 UTC): Bitcoin's trading range has now surpassed $160 for the day.      The bitcoin market has gone comatose today with a key volatility reading hitting fresh yearly lows.  The daily bitcoin volatility, as represented by the spread between the daily price high and price low (as per UTC), currently stands at $84 – the lowest level since July 9, 2017 – according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). Back then, the spread was seen at $68.  Assuming that this differential remains at $84 until 00:00 UTC hours, we can say that bitcoin's daily volatility has hit a 13-month low Friday.  The reading is of particular importance for traders as the drop in the volatility is often a precursor to the big move in prices. For instance, the daily volatility jumped to $389 on July 10, after having hit a yearly low of $97.21 on July 8.  On similar lines, the daily range spiked to $850 on June 10, after printing a low of $107 on June 7.  The data gels well with technical theory, which states that the longer the period of consolidation (low volatility period), the more violent the breakout tends to be.  Accordingly, we could be in for a big move in the next few days, possibly on the higher side as the technicals are biased toward the bulls and the BTC/USD shorts on Bitfinex are near record highs, meaning the cryptocurrency is vulnerable to a short covering rally.  All in all, the bitcoin daily volatility has hit 13-month lows at a time when the path of least resistance for bitcoin is on the higher side. So, it seems safe to say a big bullish move is overdue.  However, a break below the key support of $6,230 (Aug. 20 low) would invalidate the bullish view put forward by the technical studies.

As previously reported by CoinDesk, Australia's Commonwealth Bank (CommBank) intends to settle the bond, dubbed bond-i (for blockchain operated new debt instrument), on Tuesday, marking the first time the World Bank settles a blockchain bond. While the bank originally reported it would settle $100 million AUD ($73 million U.S.), it reported Friday that it had raised as much as $110 million AUD (roughly $81 million U.S.).  The bond's investors include CommBank, QBE Insurance, First State Super, NSW Treasury Corporation, SAFA, the Treasury Corporation of Victoria and Northern Trust, according to a release.  CommBank is using a private ethereum blockchain for bond-i, a bank press release said earlier this month. Microsoft has reviewed the platform's architecture and security.  World Bank treasurer Arunma Oteh said in a statement on Friday that the organization welcomes ""the huge interest that this transaction has generated from various stakeholders.""  She added:  ""I am delighted that this pioneer bond transaction using the distributed ledger technology, bond-i, was extremely well received by investors. We are particularly impressed with the breath of interest from official institutions, fund managers, government institutions, and banks. We were no doubt successful in moving from concept to reality because these high-quality investors understood the value of leveraging technology for innovation in capital markets.""  The organization will continue to look into how capital markets can become more secure, she said.  Coupons on the bond can be paid on February and August 28 in 2019 and 2020, the release noted. It offers a 2.2 percent return over two years, with a 2.251 percent semi-annual re-offer yield.

Customs and Border Protection will begin its live testing of a shipment tracking system on a blockchain after Labor Day, an agency official said.  As previously reported, CBP plans to trial blockchain technology in a ""live fire testing"" as part of an effort to eliminate paperwork in verifying North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) certificates. On Friday, Division of Business Transformation and Innovation head Vincent Annunziato told CoinDesk that the agency has already successfully conducted preliminary testing of the system, which has been in development over the last year.  The system is now in a proof-of-concept phase, he added.  ""It's not just checking that the system works. We're looking at the complete technical and regulatory framework that is in place,"" Annunziato said.  The private blockchain the CBP is developing is expected to duplicate the paper-based system presently in use, simplify the procedure for users and thereby reduce the time spent working on the paperwork.  With the new system, participants of importing deals will be informed of the proceedings instantly:  ""Once the supplier submits the data, not only the government is informed, but also the broker and the importer.""  The data would be input in the system ""upfront,"" streamlining the whole process of communication, he said. As an example, an individual may want to bring a dog from Germany to the U.S. If the system can guarantee the message about the dog's health comes directly from the German government, the importer won't need to supply any additional documents.  When asked about the security of the new system, Annunziato said that it is of ""the utmost importance"" and ""it's [going to] be tested."" The transparency of the new system would not affect the competition negatively, he believes: ""Would it be okay with one competitor to know that another competitor submitted 10 certificates for imports from Mexico or Canada? We think it's okay.""  Annunziato declined to name specific companies the CBP has partnered with to develop its platform, but said that the selection of partners is done by the Department of Homeland Security, explaining:  ""DHS has a bank of companies that we can use for these projects. We solicit for volunteers, the companies come forward, and then we select from that group of people.""  That being said, he did explicitly deny that CBP was working with IBM on the project.  The next stage will be testing the system for intellectual property rights, Annunziato said. The CBP is already ""taking volunteers"" for that project, though no timeline was provided.  In June, The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has awarded a grant of $192,380 to blockchain project Factom to support beta testing of a platform aimed to secure data from Border Patrol cameras and sensors.

Though no specific legislation related to blockchain was proposed, Smith said that he saw the technology as widely applicable in the public sector, including uses cases like the storage of birth certificates and marriage licenses in order to make those kinds of data more secure.  Furthermore, Smith contended that by working with universities closely, students can hone their expertise on blockchain before they graduate and start their careers. Ultimately, he is seeking to position Ohio as a possible hub for companies working with the tech.  Smith said:  ""Because this is so new and this is just beginning to take shape, we can position Ohio out front.""  As CoinDesk reported previously, Ohio introduced a bill back in May which sought to treat blockchain data and smart contracts as electronic records, as an effort to make the state a safe harbor for blockchain.

Nobuaki Kobayashi, the trustee of Mt. Gox, announced in a note on Thursday that an online claim filing system is now up and running for creditors, whether or not they filed proofs for claims in the previous bankruptcy proceeding.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, Mt. Gox creditors won a big victory in June after a Tokyo district court moved the exchange from bankruptcy to a civil rehabilitation process. Most importantly, this opens the door to creditors receiving actual bitcoin compared to a cash payout equal to the value of their holdings when Gox went bust in early 2014.  Kobayashi said that creditors have until Oct. 22 to file proofs.  ""The planned deadline for the Rehabilitation Trustee to submit a statement of approval or rejection to the court is January 24, 2019, but, at the current point in time, a definite date has not been determined,"" the trustee said in a separate Q&A document.  However, users who lost online login access to Mt. Gox may have to submit information in an offline method by sending proofs to an address in Tokyo designated by the Mt. Gox trustee.  Mt. Gox, once the largest bitcoin exchange by trading volume, declared bankruptcy in 2014 after more than 744,000 BTC was stolen. Creditors subsequently began a years-long process in a bid to retrieve their funds.  As bitcoin's price soared to nearly $20,000 late last year, several creditors filed a petition to the bankruptcy court in Tokyo, seeking to move the case into civil rehabilitation.  Currently, lawyers representing several Mt. Gox creditors who filed the petition are also drafting a proposed refund policy, arguing that Mt. Gox should repay creditors with the same cryptocurrencies they deposited with the exchange instead of cash.  And such assets should be sent to ""exchanges in which many creditors have accounts or can open accounts easily,"" as previously reported by CoinDesk.

To start with, the leading cryptocurrency has remained well above the key support of $6,230 (Aug. 20 low) despite the ETF rejection, adding credence to our assessment that the cryptomarkets had already priced in the bad news.  Further, the decision by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to review the rejection of the nine bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds (ETF) could demoralize the bears and trigger an unwinding of the short positions.  It is worth noting that the BTC/USD shorts on Bitfinex are hovering near record highs seen on April 12. So, there is a real risk of a significant short covering rally.  BTC/USD Shorts on Bitfinex  And last but not the least, the technical chart below indicates the path of least resistance remains to the upside while BTC is holding above the crucial rising trendline.  At press time, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,550 – up 1.6 percent on a 24-hour basis, having bottomed out at $5,859 on Aug. 14.  4-hour chart  BTC continues to create higher lows (bullish pattern) along the rising trendline. The bullish crossover between the 50-candle and 100-candle moving averages (MA) also favors further gains in BTC.  Also, an extended period of consolidation often paves way for a violent move, according to the technical theory.  Hence, the bullish move could be sharp, similar to the one we saw on April 12, as the Bollinger bands (standard deviation of +2, -2 on 20-candle MA) have been flatlined since Aug. 11, meaning the cryptocurrency is lacking a clear bias for close to two weeks.  View  The odds are stacked in favor of a violent bullish move in bitcoin toward $7,000 (Psychological hurdle).  The bullish view will be aborted if BTC finds acceptance below the rising trendline support, currently located at $6,432.  BTC bears will likely be emboldened and could push the cryptocurrency below $6,000 (February low) if prices see a UTC close below $6,230 (Aug. 20 low).

The Singapore Exchange (SGX) said in a release on Friday that the collaboration is aimed at scaling up the country's Delivery versus Payment (DvP) capacity so that it's able to automate transactions via blockchain-based smart contracts. DvP is a settlement process that ensures assets are transacted only when corresponding payments are received.  Lending technological support is a list of well-known firms like Nasdaq and professional services firm Deloitte, as well as blockchain startup Anquan, according to the announcement.  The goal is to develop a distributed network where financial institutions and investors can transact securities that have been converted into digital tokens through different blockchain platforms.  The partners said the technology will be engineered based on the open source code resulting from the latest development of Project Ubin, which the MAS initialed in 2016 test out settling interbank transactions via distributed ledger technology.  A detailed report identifying and examining key design considerations will be released by November, according to the release.  Tinku Gupta, the project chair and SGX's head of technology, said in a statement:  ""This initiative will deploy blockchain technology to efficiently link up funds transfer and securities transfer, eliminating both buyers' and sellers' risk in the DvP process.""    The SGX is not the only securities trading platform that is turning to blockchain for potentially faster securities settlements.      Currently, the Australia Securities Exchange is also moving toward a replacement for its existing settlement system built with blockchain startup Digital Asset Holdings, which it expects to roll out in 2020.

It notably takes aim at cryptocurrency projects that set up operations using overseas IP addresses but solicit investment from Chinese residents and use mobile and internet payments tools to facilitate cryptocurrency trading.

42429580,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzp3h,1535098199,A Phone Call Could Change Ethereum's Future – And It's Happening Today,"Full details of the now concluded developer meeting can be found here.      Miners, investors, developers and more.  That's a summary of the diverse set of ethereum stakeholders that will be in attendance at an upcoming developer call, according to Ethereum Foundation communication officer Hudson Jameson. Set to take place at 14:00 UTC Friday, the live-streamed meeting aims to address some of the platform's most challenging questions ahead of its system-wide upgrade planned for October.  As part of that upgrade, there are several non-contentious ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs) already ready for testing, but also included are others that have stirred up controversy.  In particular, three concepts – the difficulty bomb, ether issuance and ASIC resistance – are at the heart of the debate, since each could have a lasting impact on how the blockchain operates. For instance, these code proposals could alter the regularity of ethereum upgrades, change the network's economic policy and prevent specialized hardware from mining on the blockchain.  As such, core developers that usually attend the meetings have called for a larger set of voices, namely ether miners and investors, to be present to discuss a way forward.  ""There is a strong community sentiment toward delaying the bomb, to reduce the block reward and to introduce changes to the hashing algorithm, however, it's unclear how we proceed from here,"" communications officer for ethereum software provider Parity Technologies, Afri Schoedon, told CoinDesk.  In the run up to the meeting, debate has been building on social media, with many of the platform's stakeholders holding incompatible view points. And because the outcome will impact stakeholders in conflicting ways, Jameson has invited a number of people to the call to give their positions on the proposals.  ""We have multiple miners, including nearly 50 percent of the ethereum hashing power (46 percent) either attending the call or making statements that will be read during the call,"" Jameson said.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Our aim was to have a variety of voices collaborate on this issue.""  Investors  Adding urgency to the current discussion is the so-called ""difficulty bomb"" – a piece of code locked into the platform that makes its blocks steadily less efficient to mine over time.  Because delaying the bomb also impacts issuance, there are a total of six conflicting proposals, each offering slightly varying methods for moving forward.  Two proposals on the agenda for Friday's meeting seek to reduce issuance — something some ether holders believe is too high. (Currently, the inflation rate is fixed at 3 ETH per block — down from 5 ETH since last October.)  While there's a host of ethereum investors who have yet to publicly comment on the matter, several investors have taken to social media to call for a reduction in ethereum issuance, contending that the current inflation rate is an unnecessarily high tax on the holders of the cryptocurrency.  For example, some are pointing to a quote attributed to the creator of ethereum Vitalik Buterin in 2017 that states: ""In the foreseeable future, the supply will not go far above 100 million,"" a figure which as now been surpassed.  Others are going so far as to blame the inflation rate as the reason for ether's market value decline, which hit a 2018 low of less than $300 earlier this month.  ""Ether issuance is wildly over where it should be,"" one user wrote.  Still, because it decreases the quantity of ether that miners are awarded to mine blocks, there's a risk that too high an issuance reduction with be harmful to miners, forcing them to move their equipment onto another network.  Miners  That said, some are arguing that despite high issuance, miners that rely on general purpose hardware are already suffering.  ""There is basically zero profit right now for normal GPU miners,"" one user claimed on Github.  As detailed by CoinDesk, while ethereum was previously thought to be a GPU-friendly, ASIC-resistant cryptocurrency, the specialized mining chips have been available for use on the network since March. Leading advocates of GPU mining argue that efforts should be made immediately to remove the hardware from the platform.  In the past few months, the questions of ASIC resistance largely fell quiet, but questions around tweaking the difficulty bomb and underlying issuance model have caused the arguments to reactivate. And that's because proponents argue that a reduction in issuance could push the last remaining GPU miners off the network, that are already competing against a rising hashrate.  Several stakeholders are pointing to a proposal named EIP 1057 as a method for ASIC resistance, that uses a randomizing, ASIC-resistant proof-of-work algorithm originally designed for monero to remain resilient against ASIC hardware manufacturers.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Peter Pratscher, the founder and CEO of Ethermine, an ether mining pool, said that among the company's miners, the question of ASIC resistant eclipses all other concerns.  ""We have reached out to our miners and from their response, it is clear that the most important point for them is to include a [proof-of-work] change to obsolescence ASICs,"" Pratscher said, adding that the attitude around issuance was ""somewhat ambivalent.""  Still, it's a question that has proven to be divisive, with some users taking to Reddit to warn it is ""not the answer,"" and could impinge on valuable developer time in the run up to proof-of-stake.  Developers  Of all the platforms stakeholders, developers are perhaps the most difficult to pin down – especially as many avoid taking a position in polarized debates, preferring instead to focus on delivering code.  Still, among this group, there's a general tendency to be less interested in the question of issuance — in part because there's an attitude that the high valuation of ether reduces its usefulness within the platform.  For many ethereum developers for example, the question of ASIC resistance is also of important ideological importance, because it relates to the underlying decentralization of the network — and therefore its resilience to attack.  Others hold the inverse position, believing that by raising the cost of attacking the network — ASICs are comparatively much more expensive than GPUs — the hardware is good for security.  That said, there is a topic that remains of particular interest to the developers – the difficulty bomb.  ""Delaying the bomb is the easiest part, everyone pretty much agrees we should do that,"" Schoedon told CoinDesk.  And while it's true the consensus roughly is that the bomb should be delayed, there's some disagreement about whether to remove its code entirely or to keep it embedded in the software. Because it was installed to prepare the network for the change to proof-of-stake, some argue that it is now irrelevant given the delay in that change's timeline for execution.  Still, others believe that it has developed an entirely new function — forcing ethereum to come together and find consensus on complicated problems, just like these.  Speaking to this, because of the difficulty bomb, core developer Nick Johnson told CoinDesk:  ""People are welcome to stick with the status quo, but they have to make an affirmative decision to do so, rather than letting inertia do the work for them.""

42429594,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzpTh,1535083219,A Fight Is Breaking Out Over Bitcoin Cash – And It Just Might Split the Code,"With bitcoin cash developers at each other throats, the year-old cryptocurrency might just split into two.  Created from a hard fork off the original bitcoin network after the scaling debate boiled over last year, bitcoin cash stakeholders seemed unified in their goal of boosting the cryptocurrency's block size parameter in the hopes of attracting more users and enabling more transactions.  But a few cracks started to pop up in this united front over the past year, as bitcoin cash developers had one technical disagreement after another.  And a new software release by leading bitcoin cash implementation, Bitcoin ABC, has been perceived by some as a subtle declaration of war within the developer community.  The software includes a suite of upgrades, including a smart contract feature that would support atomic swaps, a way of trading one cryptocurrency for another without traditional exchanges. And while many cryptocurrency projects are excited about the idea of interoperable coins, some big names in the bitcoin cash community don't agree with the changes and have – no surprise – been very vocal about it.  Leading the opposition is Craig Wright, nChain CEO and the cryptographer who claims to be bitcoin's pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto, though he's not provided any proof of this claim so far. And he's teamed up with Calvin Ayre, an entrepreneur and founder of crypto news site CoinGeek, to lead the resistance with a new bitcoin cash implementation called Bitcoin SV.  Bitcoin SV scraps Bitcoin ABC's scripts for its own – as well as pushes the block size parameter to 128 MB (bitcoin cash's block size is currently at 32 MB).  Taking a dig at Bitcoin ABC developers, the Bitcoin SV release announcement reads:  ""Bitcoin SV is intended to provide a clear bitcoin cash implementation choice for miners who support bitcoin's original vision, over implementations that seek to make unnecessary changes to the original bitcoin protocol.""  While infighting about the technical direction of a cryptocurrency is no out of the ordinary occurrence, this particular disagreement could have big repercussions for bitcoin cash.  Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV are incompatible software, and both groups behind the implementations are seeking to trigger new code changes in November. As such, if some bitcoin cash users run one software and others run the other, it'll cause a chain split and create a new competing cryptocurrency.  All about 'fake Satoshi'  The fire underlying this technical debate was fueled by none other than one of bitcoin cash's more prominent supporters – Wright.  After ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin took the mic at a cryptocurrency conference to call Wright a ""fraud,"" many developers and other stakeholders in the industry started taking sides. For instance, many devs argue against nChain's Bitcoin SV partly because they've started to distrust Wright's judgment.  Even Jihan Wu, the co-founder of mining hardware manufacturer Bitmain, who has been a proponent of bitcoin cash (his business holds a substantial stake in the cryptocurrency), joined many others on social media calling Wright ""fake Satoshi"" since they don't believe his claims that he created bitcoin.  Following up on his earlier condemnation, Buterin later tweeted:  ""The bitcoin cash community should not compromise with Craig Wright to 'avoid a split' and should embrace it as an opportunity to conclusively ostracize and reject him.""  Despite all this, though, Wright is far from alone in supporting the nChain implementation. Ayre promised in a statement to put all CoinGeek's mining power towards it (the mining pool is the largest for bitcoin cash at press time), and Cobra, the pseudonymous owner of Bitcoin.org, took to social media to voice his opinion that those behind Bitcoin ABC are in the wrong.  ""This is what happens when you have incompetent rogue developers like Bitcoin ABC lead developer [Amaury Sechet] pushing their agenda instead of compromising,"" Cobra tweeted. ""Tired of these fucking amateurs and morons screwing around with bitcoin cash. Upgrade with consensus, or don't upgrade at all.""  Attempts at compromise  What's getting lost in the debate, though, is that several notable bitcoin cash developers actually think both sides are acting out and would instead prefer to compromise.  Besides BitcoinABC and nChain, there are still other bitcoin cash implementations, including Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited, two software implementations that actually predate bitcoin cash.  And these veteran developers are skeptical about the two proposals getting the most attention.  ""Both ABC and nChain are trying to hard fork. Both of them are not giving any rationale why. Both of them are completely not responsive to any feedback or any compromise requests from the rest of the ecosystem,"" wrote Bitcoin Classic lead developer Thomas Zander.  And Bitcoin Unlimited lead developer Andrew Stone agrees.  He's not particularly swayed by either side, arguing that both developer groups don't have the best interest of the end user in mind.  ""Given the 'no changes, no matter how reasonable, except mine' strategy being pursued by both of these organizations, I can only sadly conclude that this is again about power and ego not about technical merit and end-user adoption,"" Stone wrote on a popular bitcoin cash forum.  Instead, he believes bitcoin cash proponents need to ""stick together,"" and to that goal, he's working on a code change that would allow Bitcoin Unlimited users to effectively vote on which set of changes they'd like to see activated.  This voting system, he hopes, will help resolve not only this caustic debate but also similar situations in the future.  Meanwhile, on Thursday, Cobra announced a similar effort called the Cobra Client. But rather than allow users to vote, the client simply removes all contentious code changes and replaces them with replay protection, a code change that will protect users from accidentally losing their money in the case bitcoin cash does indeed split into two.  Yet, others, such as long-time crypto enthusiast and Bitcoin Magazine reporter Aaron Van Wirdum, remain pessimistic that a compromise will be reached.  Van Wirdum recently tweeted:  ""Turns out if you start a coin by hard fork without consensus, precedent is to hard fork without consensus.""

In its most recent update for entrepreneurs wishing to set up businesses in the U.K., the Department for International Trade announced that Entrepreneur First (EF), a pre-seed investment company, is now also funding blockchain startups. EF is one of the government-recognized organizations that can endorse firms for entrepreneur visas.  According to the post, startups with ""high growth potential"" can apply for an entrepreneur visa to launch its business in the U.K. To be qualified for the visa, the entrepreneur must receive funding of at least £50,000 (approximately $64,000) from an organization that is approved by the U.K. government.  The post added:  ""EF is particularly interested in founders who want to solve hard technical problems. Their alumni are having an impact in fields such as artificial intelligence, drones, security, virtual reality and the blockchain and have raised funding from the world's leading venture investors.""  Approved startups will participate in a six-month program which would provide support for it to develop its team, product and potentially receive further investment, according to the post.  Founded in 2011, Entrepreneur First is a backed by major investors, including Reid Hoffman, Greylock Partners, Mosaic Ventures and Peter Thiel's Founders Fund. According to its website, it has helped build over 80 companies to date and raised over $100 million in venture investment.
