42433205,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO3yfh,1606256715,Coinbase Ditches US Customer Tax Form That Set Off False Alarms at IRS,"Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has decided to discontinue sending customers 1099-Ks, the U.S. tax form that led the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to mistakenly think traders had underreported their gains.      The exchange will instead use the 1099-MISC form, at least for customers who earn interest on lending and similar products, it said in a Tuesday blog post, The post appeared to suggest traders who do not meet the criteria for the 1099-MISC will likely not receive any kind of forms from Coinbase for preparing their returns. When asked for comment, a Coinbase spokesperson simply sent CoinDesk a link to the post.      Coinbase said in the post it will not issue IRS form 1099-K for the 2020 tax year. Used by some crypto exchanges to report transactions for eligible users, the 1099-K form can often be confusing because it reports only the gross proceeds of crypto transactions without taking the base price into account.      Hence, the forms can sometimes show all transactions as generating revenue even if some may have actually caused a loss. If you bought a coin for $1 and sold it for 50 cents, your 50-cent loss would appear to be a gain, for example. This in turn may lead to exchanges reporting a significantly inflated tax burden for the user.      This scenario seems to have played out recently when the IRS sent at least dozens of crypto users notices warning they had underreported their holdings. Such warning letters had also been sent to crypto users last year.      Read more: IRS Again Warns Crypto Investors They Under-Reported Gains      In its blog post Coinbase said it will not issue form 1099-Bs either. The crypto exchange’s post added that 1099-MISC forms will be sent to users who earn “$600 or more in crypto from Coinbase Earn, USDC Rewards, and/or Staking in 2020.” These are income-generating products, similar to bank deposits.      But the post also did not indicate whether in the absence of a form 1099-K regular crypto sales would be recorded on the 1099-MISC forms as well. Customers who don’t receive any forms from Coinbase and sold or converted crypto in 2020 are still responsible for reporting to the IRS and should consult a tax professional, Coinbase said.      If the 1099-MISC became standard for traders, “a lot more people are gonna get it because the threshold for getting a 1099-MISC is very low” said Shehan Chandrasekera, head of tax strategy at CoinTracker, a portfolio monitoring service. Whereas a 1099-K is strictly for payees receiving more than 200 transactions a year worth over $20,000, the 1099-MISC would capture everyone getting $600 and up.      While switching to the 1099-MISC is “not a perfect solution” to problems faced in crypto tax reporting, it could help Coinbase improve its compliance status by subjecting more users to reporting requirements, Chandrasekera said.      Read more: PayPal’s Crypto Offering May Be ‘a Huge Headache’ for Taxpayers      He pointed out the switch to a new form doesn’t solve the “cost basis issue,” because the 1099-MISC form also has no place to report the price a cryptocurrency may have been purchased for. Even if there were a place in the form, Coinbase wouldn’t necessarily be able to find the information, therefore making it the user’s responsibility to keep track of the price for which they bought the assets, said Chandrasekera, who is a certified public accountant (CPA).",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Jaspreet Kalra,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/24/coinbase-ditches-us-customer-tax-form-that-set-off-false-alarms-at-irs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/68048b0c4dd952dadbb9902453fb0171805c5849-1602x1060.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433211,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO3yth,1606255268,"Coinbase Will Suspend All Margin Trading Tomorrow, Citing CFTC Guidance","Crypto exchange Coinbase plans to end all margin trading effective Nov. 25, 2020, due to recent regulations by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).      The San Francisco-based trading platform announced Tuesday that it would prevent customers from placing new margin trades beginning at 2 p.m. PT (22:00 UTC) on Wednesday, while simultaneously canceling any open limit orders.      Coinbase will end the margin trading feature entirely next month, once existing positions expire. When customers trade on margin, they’re effectively borrowing funds from the exchange or broker to cover the cost of an investment in an asset such as a security or a cryptocurrency. This allows traders to leverage their positions, thus amplifying profits – or losses.      The exchange pointed to “recent guidance” from the CFTC, referring to the Commission’s March guidance around “actual delivery” of digital assets as the reason for this decision, but didn’t specify which aspect of the guidance led to the move.      That guidance, which has its roots in a 2016 enforcement action against Bitfinex, sought to provide rules around when a customer can be said to have legally taken control of a cryptocurrency, including when the customer acquires the crypto through a margin or leveraged product.      Assets purchased through leverage or a margin contract cannot be liquidated, according to the guidance.    ‘Actual delivery’    Coinbase appears to be saying that it is difficult, if not impossible, for it to comply with a CFTC requirement that neither it nor any affiliated entity can have any sort of control over a cryptocurrency once it's been delivered in accordance with the terms of a margin contract.      Under the terms of the CFTC’s guidance, “actual delivery” has occurred when a customer controls the cryptocurrency purchased, including if it was acquired via a margin or leveraged product, and the seller has no control over the cryptocurrency in question.      Coinbase has taken issue with this point in the past. In a comment letter to the CFTC discussing the then-proposed guidance, it wrote that affiliates of the seller should be able to hold the cryptocurrencies.      “Requiring unfettered ability to transfer digital assets would effectively mean that U.S. entities and regulated entities, or entities using cold storage or other asset protection methods, could not hold digital assets acquired through margined transactions,” then-Chief Legal and Risk Officer Mike Lempres wrote in 2018.      The final guidance approved in 2020 said that the offeror, seller or affiliated entities cannot have any interest, legal right or control over the commodity.      Essentially, Coinbase would have to register with the CFTC as a commodities exchange if it wants to continue offering leveraged products.      Other exchanges in the U.S., like Kraken, also offer margin trading. A spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Kraken was also looking at the actual delivery guidance.      “We believe clear, common-sense regulations for margin lending products are needed to protect and provide peace of mind to U.S. customers,” Coinbase’s blog post said. “We look forward to working closely with regulators to achieve this goal.”      UPDATE (Nov. 24, 2020, 22:50 UTC): This article has been updated with additional information.",NEGATIVE,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/24/coinbase-will-suspend-all-margin-trading-tomorrow-citing-cftc-guidance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/35c8f7b6f904b0545db9db961bd1b7fe5f635ac4-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $18,059-$19,392  BTC below its 10-day moving average but above 50-day, a sideways signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price broke above $19,000 Tuesday, hitting as high as $19,392, according to CoinDesk 20 data. Its price lost some steam after but rebounded to $18,987 as of press time.

Tuesday is shaping up to be the second highest in the past month as billion-dollar volume days for the five exchanges are becoming more common.      Global equities are also having a bullish day, with indexes flashing green in a major way:    Asia’s Nikkei 225 ended the day in the green 2.5% as formal transition approval for Joe Biden’s U.S. presidency plus positive coronavirus vaccine news lifted the index.  The FTSE 100 in Europe closed up 1.5% as the news President-elect Biden is nominating former U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen to be Treasury Secretary boosted sentiment.  In the United States the S&P climbed 1.5% as investors hit the buy button on value stocks amid increased political certainty heading into 2021.    Since starting the year uncorrelated with the S&P 500 – which is denoted as “0” in the chart below – bitcoin’s performance has more closely matched stocks after March’s crash when assets dropped amid COVID-19 concerns. The correlation coefficient of the two on a 90-day basis is now around 0.3.      An optimistic economic environment has given both stocks and bitcoin “risk-on” properties as investment assets.      “Bitcoin has now shifted to a risk-on trade along with equities markets,” noted Jason Lau, chief operating officer of San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin.      Analysts expect $20,000 per 1 BTC to arrive soon, which could produce some profit-induced selling but also more bullish buying, according to Rich Rosenblum, head of trading at crypto firm GSR.      “Hitting $20,000 will likely bring some profit-taking,” noted Rosenblum. “Yet, reaching a new all-time high will also bring validation for bitcoin, which may spur more buying once we are firmly above $20,000. Once we reach a new high, every bitcoin investor will be in the money.”    ETH options heating up    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Tuesday, trading around $604 and climbing 1.6% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

The top day was Sept. 1, when total contracts reached 201,815.

42433199,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO3yXh,1606247599,BitMEX Founder's Charges Highlight Risks for DeFi,"In October, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed enforcement actions against the entities and individuals that own and operate the Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange (BitMEX), a trading platform for cryptocurrency derivatives.      The CFTC alleges that since 2014 BitMEX has operated an unregistered trading platform and violated CFTC regulations by, among other things, failing to implement required anti-money laundering (“AML”) procedures. The DOJ in turn is charging BitMEX’s three founders and its first employee with criminal violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and conspiracy for willfully failing to establish, implement and maintain an adequate AML program.    Grant Fondo is a partner and co-chair, Meghan Spillane a partner and Galen Phillips an associate in Goodwin’s Digital Currency + Blockchain Practice.    The BitMEX actions signal an expansion of regulatory scrutiny. These actions also emphasize that U.S. regulators will work together to hold individuals responsible for registration violations and inadequate compliance protocols.      While BitMEX is a highly centralized exchange platform where the founders allegedly still collectively exercise 90% ownership and control, the BitMEX actions also have implications for decentralized finance (DeFi). If DeFi platforms offer financial products to U.S. residents, such as derivatives, that would trigger registration or AML obligations for a centralized entity, what is happening to BitMEX suggests the platform and its founders may still face scrutiny from U.S. regulators.    Background    Being registered in the Seychelles allowed BitMEX users to trade cryptocurrency derivatives. As of last year, according to the regulators, BitMEX has allegedly earned more than $1 billion in user transaction fees since 2014. The CFTC asserts BitMEX violated the Commodities Exchange Act by failing to register as a future commissions merchant. The CFTC and DOJ also allege BitMEX failed to implement compliance procedures required of financial institutions active in U.S. markets, such as AML protocols. Users allegedly could register with BitMEX by providing a verified email address and were not required to provide any documents to verify their identity or location.    Offshore registration and living offshore are not enough to avoid the jurisdiction of U.S. law enforcement.    The DOJ alleges BitMEX’s conduct constitutes a willful violation of the BSA. The CFTC and DOJ each assert jurisdiction over BitMEX based on allegations of defendants’ business in the U.S., and the soliciting and accepting of orders and funds from U.S. users. The government alleges BitMEX’s “maze” of offshore entities was meant to obscure its significant contacts with the U.S. Despite being registered in the Seychelles, BitMEX allegedly has no physical presence there, but does have many subsidiaries and affiliates in the U.S. The CFTC also points out:    Approximately half of BitMEX’s workforce is based in the U.S.  It developed and runs its website in the U.S.  One founder allegedly lived in the U.S.  Another founder, while residing abroad, owns his interest through a Delaware LLC and has a U.S. bank account  BitMEX actively solicited and marketed to U.S. residents through participation in industry events and the development of a bounty program for U.S. users    The government alleges BitMEX’s withdrawal from the U.S. in 2015 was a ruse and that U.S. residents’ continued access to BitMEX was an “open secret” because BitMEX only required IP verification upon creating an account and allowed users to sign in through the Tor Network and VPN.      The government also alleges the defendants attempted to avoid U.S. law by incorporating in the Seychelles, allegedly barring – but knowingly allowing – U.S.-based users to participate, and deleting evidence of U.S.-based users. The DOJ alleges these steps to circumvent U.S. law reveal the defendants’ willful violation of the BSA.    Key lessons    Blockchain-based platforms involved in both centralized finance (CeFi) and DeFi can learn the following from the BitMEX actions:      Offshore registration and living offshore are not enough to avoid the jurisdiction of U.S. law enforcement. In assessing whether U.S. law applies to an exchange or platform, regulators will look beyond form and determine whether the substance of an individual’s or entity’s conduct provides sufficient jurisdictional basis.      Avoiding U.S. markets is only effective if you actually avoid U.S. markets. Though tautological, a business can only avoid U.S. regulation by truly staying outside of U.S. markets. According to the U.S. government, it is not enough to disclaim U.S. contacts and take half-measures to achieve that goal. Notably, the government focused in this case on BitMEX’s continued marketing efforts in the U.S.      See also: BitMEX Says It’s ‘Business as Usual’ Despite 30% Drop in Bitcoin Balance After CFTC, DOJ Action      Founders and employees may have exposure for a platform’s activity if steps are not taken to comply with applicable law. If a platform has contacts within the U.S. or has not taken affirmative, reasonable steps to exclude U.S. persons from the platform, U.S. regulators may seek to establish jurisdiction. Even absent centralized ownership or founder control, regulators may target individuals within the company, including those who developed or created the digital asset, protocol or platform, if it was designed and launched without taking into account compliance obligations.      The absence of immediate legal repercussions is not proof of an absence of liability. The DOJ and CFTC cite conduct from more than five years ago. Law enforcement need not, and rarely will, charge a defendant at the first sign of potential illegality. Thus, compliance with applicable laws should be a continuing priority, regardless of whether a company faces immediate regulatory scrutiny.      BitMEX has developed a reputation as one the largest and most successful offshore digital currency exchanges. The government’s actions show how U.S. regulators will work together in bringing enforcement actions, bringing scrutiny to even those that might initially appear beyond the reach of U.S. law.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,"Grant Fondo, Meghan Spillane, Galen Phillips",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/24/bitmex-founders-charges-highlight-risks-for-defi,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

As reported by Decrypt, Binance is threatening a hard deadline to herd U.S. users off its original exchange platform (not to be confused with Binance US, which is legally open to U.S. residents). Email notices sent to U.S. users give them 14 days to withdraw funds before Binance shutters their accounts for good.      ""As we constantly perform periodic sweeps of our existing controls, we noted that you are trying to access Binance while having identified yourself as a U.S. person. Please note that as per our Terms of Use, we are unable to service U.S. persons. Please register for an account over at our partner, Binance US,” the notice reads.      “You have 14 days to close all active positions on your account and withdraw all your funds, failing which your account will be locked. Once your account is locked, you will have to raise a customer service ticket for us to assist you further,” it continues.      The Block noted the bans appear to be based on IP addresses. However, at least one U.S. user who never underwent know-your-customer (KYC) identity verification has not received a notice of account closure from Binance, CoinDesk has learned.      Upon registering for Binance, users have the option to defer KYC measures that would reveal their identities in exchange for lower daily deposit and withdrawal maximums. Additionally, it's not clear whether Binance cross-checked the physical location users claimed when signing up with their IP addresses.      Binance did not immediately respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment on whether it geoblocks based on IP or KYC information.      Binance opened its U.S. exchange at the end of 2019 after U.S. regulators put pressure on the exchange to shut down access to U.S. denizens. Its team has been attempting to geo-block U.S. users since July of last year, though it has ramped up efforts recently to make a final sweep.

42433213,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO3yvh,1606246937,Yearning for Pickle? Two DeFi Protocols Merge,"The anonymously operated yield farm Pickle Finance has cut a deal to merge with Yearn, the latter's lead developer, Andre Cronje, posted on Medium Tuesday.      ""Pickle and Yearn developers have worked out a structure to allow the two projects to work together in symbiosis. This is done to reduce duplicate work, increase specialization and to leverage shared expertise,"" Cronje wrote.      Timing and other details remain to be announced.      Yearn is one of the leading projects in decentralized finance (DeFi), serving its users as a way to automatically optimize yield for a set of cryptocurrencies. Pickle was started as a yield farm whose initial purpose was to help push four key stablecoins back onto their target price, but it has since evolved into something that operates more like Yearn, with its own set of yield optimizing pools.      Pickle Finance was hit by an exploit in which $19.7 million in DAI was lost. This follows a bug in late September where funds got temporarily locked after a bug was found in its smart contracts.      In the Pickle Discord channel, one of its moderators, 0xPenguin, shared Cronje's post, writing:    ""The idea of the merger, and the long-term benefits to everyone – investors, community members and developers – emerged during the process of working with the Yearn team in the investigation of the exploit.""    When news of the exploit first emerged, another moderator, Larry the Cucumber, wrote, ""We will not be issuing any IOU tokens so as to not impede the growth of this protocol going forward.""      However, with the announcement of the merger, 0xPenguin backtracked on that somewhat, writing, ""A solution has been found that allows us to announce the issuance of a new token – CORNICHON, to act as a debt instrument to help those who were affected by the exploit.""      How CORNICHON will accrue value has not yet been revealed. The tokens ""will be minted against a snapshot of balances at the time of the attack and distributed to victims proportionally. Further measures may then be adopted by Pickle Governance through its regular decision process,"" Cronje wrote.

Meanwhile, a spokesperson from the Malta-based crypto exchange has confirmed with CoinDesk that the date to resume its cryptocurrency withdrawal service will be sometime before the previously disclosed Nov. 27 Hong Kong Standard Time (GMT+8) date.    Data from CryptoQuant shows OKEx has been testing reopening its withdrawal system, as 0.02 BTC was moved out from an OKEx wallet.  Ki Young Ju, chief executive officer of CryptoQuant, said in a tweet the reopening of withdrawal service on OKEx could cause pricing volatility because of ""bulk withdrawal"" requests.  OKEx's latest announcement to compensate users frustrated by the withdrawal suspension seems to be the exchange's way of trying to keep those who intend to leave the exchange immediately after the service resumes.  Users who have made deposits, held tokens or traded during the withdrawal suspension time period will receive 20% of OKEx's total income from futures and perpetual swap transaction fees over the last seven weeks.

Personal views on bitcoin  October 2015: “We do not interpret bitcoin’s popularity as having a relationship with the public’s view of the Federal Reserve’s conduct of monetary policy.”  December 2017: “It is not a stable store of value and it doesn’t constitute legal tender. It is a highly speculative asset.”  October 2018: “I will just say outright I am not a fan, and let me tell you why. I know there are hundreds of cryptocurrencies and maybe something is coming down the line that is more appealing but I think first of all, very few transactions [that] are actually handled by bitcoin, and many of those do take place on bitcoin are illegal, illicit transactions.”  Bitcoin and regulation  February 2014: “The Fed doesn’t have authority to supervise or regulate bitcoin in any way.”  October 2015: Yellen said the U.S.’ financial regulators should not “stifle innovation.”  December 2017: “... [T]he Fed doesn’t really play any role, any regulatory role with respect to bitcoin other than assuring that banking organizations that we do supervise are attentive that they’re appropriately managing any interactions they have with participants in that market, and appropriately monitoring anti-money laundering [and] Bank Secrecy Act responsibilities that they have.”  Blockchain  September 2016: ""[Blockchain] could have very significant implications for the payments system and the conduct of business.""  January 2017: ""[Blockchain] is a very important, new technology that could have implications for the way in which transactions are handled throughout the financial system.""    It’s unclear how Yellen might approach crypto regulations, or if they’ll even be a priority. However, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Federal Reserve, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) all either work closely with the Treasury Department or are bureaus within the department.      Razvan Suprovici, founder of crypto gifting service Biterica, gifted $20 in bitcoin to Yellen after her 2018 remarks, though at the time she said she hadn’t looked into the gift. If she kept the funds, they would be worth about $60 at press time.      And there was also Bitcoin Sign Guy, who flashed a “buy bitcoin” note behind Yellen while she was testifying before a congressional subcommittee in 2017.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/24/in-her-own-words-heres-what-janet-yellen-has-said-about-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6ec58a1c953a7c2daac31d01936f6ee4905ea55c-1500x989.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

JPMorgan analysts say institutions are piling into bitcoin. And the IRS has again sent out (possibly erroneous) letters to crypto traders indicating they owe taxes on unrealized gains.    Top shelf    Taxman knocketh The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is again sending mixed messages related to crypto trading and tax reporting obligations. Allegedly, “dozens of individuals” have received CP2000 letters detailing how much the IRS believes traders owe – based on gains from unreported crypto holdings in 2018, according to CryptoTrader.tax. However, as in years prior, it’s possible these traders never realized these gains and don’t owe anything. The issue may stem from how crypto exchanges report transactions to the IRS, using form 1099-K, which shows all transactions as generating revenue. Exchanges could prevent this issue by sending 1099-B reports to the IRS, which accurately mark gains and losses, TaxBit co-founder Austin Woodward told CoinDesk last time around, in March.      Institutional analysis JPMorgan analysts say institutions are piling into bitcoin at a stronger pace this quarter than they were in Q3, according to the banking giant’s “Flows & Liquidity” report. Published Friday, the analyst report compares institutional to retail buying. For instance, Q3, retail customers bought $1.6 billion worth of bitcoin using Square’s Cash App, nearly three times more than what was invested in Grayscale’s bitcoin product. Though in Q4, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is at three times its Q3 numbers. To be sure, Square has yet to post numbers related to customers’ Q4 bitcoin buys. (Grayscale, like CoinDesk, is wholly owned by Digital Currency Group.)      Gold bug to BTC 'cockroach' Pendal Group, an Australian Securities Exchange-listed investment manager with over A$100 billion (US$73.6 billion) in assets under management, is getting into bitcoin. Vimal Gor, Pendal’s head of bond, income and defensive strategies, said Monday the company is now investing in bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. As quoted by the Australian Financial Review, Gor thinks not only is bitcoin “entering the realm of mainstream,” as shown by the entrance of major hedge fund managers, but that “bitcoin is a cockroach that exists. They can’t ban it out of existence.” Pendal also reportedly aims to position BTC for their clients, as it previously has done with gold.      Crypto… currency? In case you missed it, PayPal’s CEO Dan Schulman is bullish on bitcoin as an actual currency. Luckily for him, PayPal will soon allow its network of merchants to accept bitcoin payments. Appearing on CNBC's Squawk Box on Monday, Schulman said bitcoin’s usefulness as a currency will co-exist with its buy-and-hold status. The CEO also said a central bank digital currency is a global inevitability, though that could bolster bitcoin’s utility. ""I think that there'll be more and more use cases for cryptocurrencies"" that make bitcoin more widely accepted, more stable and probably ""more valuable"" over time.      E-money license Crypto.com is trying to bulk up its Maltese financial licenses in search of a competitive edge across Europe. The Hong Kong-based crypto firm received preliminary approval from the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) for two financial licenses that govern how payment companies operate and what services they can provide. Crypto.com could soon start offering payment services and issue e-money as a licensed financial institution with MFSA oversight. It could additionally execute, custody and deal in-house with customers’ crypto assets as one of the first-ever holders of a Class 3 Virtual Financial Assets license from Malta.

Market intel    Powder keg Bitcoin hurdled past $19,000 on Tuesday, with momentum to potentially reach its all-time high of $19,783 set on Dec. 17, 2017. Bitcoin broke the $17,000 level and then $18,000 level within the same week, and has rallied $7,000 in one month. The market capitalization of bitcoin also hit its all time high this week to about $329 billion, according to data provided by crypto analytic firm CryptoQuant. With increased institutional investors entering the bitcoin market, the ease of retail buying from PayPal and Square (among other providers) as well as miners not liquidating their positions, ""it appears likely that price will continue to rise,"" according to a newsletter by CryptoQuant on Nov. 13.      Airdrops and inflows XRP continues to rally, hitting a watermark of $0.79 early Tuesday, the highest since 2018. The world’s third-largest cryptocurrency by market value is up 130% from lows near $0.30 seen on Saturday. Analysts say a recent airdrop of 45 billion “spark” tokens to XRP holders related to a forthcoming smart contract platform developed by Ripple’s investment arm could be driving the price. Still, as XRP surges, selling pressure mounts: as evidenced by nearly $1 billion in XRP flowing into exchanges, possibly for liquidation.    At stake    Deposit set Yesterday morning (in the U.S. at least), Ethereum pundit Anthony Sassano tweeted that 307,392 ETH ($181 million) had been allocated to a smart contract that would kick off the first phase of Ethereum 2.0, in what’s shaping up to be the largest blockchain overhaul to date.      That was nearly 220,000 ETH shy of the total amount needed to get things rolling on schedule. Exactly 524,288 ETH (worth over $325 million) needed to be locked up in the so-called deposit contract to begin the next phase of development by Dec. 1.      Yesterday evening, that amount was matched, a significant feat of community commitment. Now begins the hard part.      Ethereum will undergo a transition in consensus model, from the proof-of-work system implemented in Bitcoin to the proof-of-stake mechanism thought to improve blockchain scalability. Eth 2.0 will also see the implementation of sharding, another cryptographic technique meant to improve transaction throughput.      While the launch of the actual Eth 2.0 network is a ways off, on Dec. 1 a parallel proof-of-stake blockchain dubbed “the Beacon chain” will go live. In this initial phase of development, the PoW Ethereum and Beacon chain will exist side-by-side.      Those that pledged funds to the deposit contract will be validators on this experimental network, and earn rewards for processing transactions and creating new blocks. CoinDesk is just one of many network validators.      One potential reason funding for the deposit contract came down to the wire is the staked ether is irretrievable in the short term, at least until Ethereum 2.0 development progresses to a significant degree.      Viktor Bunin, a protocol specialist at blockchain infrastructure service provider Bison Trails, said that while some users may be put off by the one-way nature of staking ETH in the contract, “by and large the community is extremely excited to launch Eth 2.0.”      The Beacon chain activation is the first of four phases of the Ethereum 2.0 migration, which begins with the onboarding of validators and eventually leads to the full transition of all users and dapps to the new network.      “There’s not a chance that Eth 2.0 doesn’t launch,” Bunin told CoinDesk. “Eth 2.0 is a vision. It is a drive to improve Ethereum to scale support for the entire planet. Even if this launch is not successful for some reason, you can be sure that the community will learn from it and try, and try, again.”    Food for thought",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/24/blockchain-bites-ethereum-20-deposit-contract-fully-loaded-irs-sends-befuddling-letters-again,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e3b18637c263b89e4cabf5d88ae2754c1a796e28-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433221,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO3z7h,1606233008,First Mover: Why Is Bitcoin's Price Rising? Here Are a Few Possible Answers,"What’s behind this current run-up in the price of bitcoin? That’s a question for which many people want a definitive answer. So far, one unifying theory is tough to come by.      What we do know is that since mid-October the price of bitcoin shot up from the $11,000 range to the cusp of $19,000. And while prices are a few hundred dollars shy of its all-time high, bitcoin’s market cap recently set a record by breaking above $345 billion; since the mega-rally in 2017, more bitcoin has been mined and put into circulation.      For a large swath of market observers, the cause of the rally is clear: more buyers with deeper pockets. If so, that augurs well for continued gains. But there’s also a plausible theory that unusual circumstances have temporarily constrained supply, calling into question the rally’s staying power.    The case for demand: New money    It seems not a day goes by without some story of a major financial institution warming up to bitcoin, if not outright embracing it. A CIO at BlackRock saying on CNBC that it “could take the place of gold to a large extent.” An analyst at Citi saying bitcoin could reach $318,000 by the end of 2021. A report from JPMorgan claiming institutions are buying at three times the amount they were in the previous quarter.      The world is in the midst of a pandemic that is wreaking economic turmoil on every continent, even Antarctica. Central banks are printing fiat currency as fast as they can (funnily enough, Hewlett Packard’s stock is up 3% year to date). Governments are also in on the act, throwing trillions of dollars, euros and anything else they can borrow in an effort to stave off an economic calamity that would lead to social unrest and violence in the streets – or more of it.      Since its birth in the depths of the global financial crisis more than a decade ago, such potentially inflationary measures were exactly the sort of things bitcoin advocates warned about, and perhaps secretly hoped for, when they began stocking up on digital assets.      Then there’s the data. CoinDesk’s Galen Moore spells out in a recent piece four ways this current rally is different from the one of 2017. More “whale” accounts are holding 1,000 or more bitcoin than ever before, and unlike three years ago they have been growing in number with higher prices. Bitcoin and its closest rival, ether, are making recent highs together, whereas in 2017 ether’s record prices were in the rearview mirror for months after bitcoin was going higher. Regulated markets are part of the mix this time around, with the CME daily futures trading volume hitting north of $1 billion several days the past few months. And since the start of 2020 some 200,000 bitcoin have been sold by investors in East Asia to satiate the growing appetites of their counterparts in North America.      These are all profoundly bullish signals. However, there remains a gnawing “why” question: Why just now?      After all, preliminary data on three vaccines for COVID-19 have shown an efficacy rate of 90% or higher. The very physical threat that loomed over workplaces and every aspect of everyone’s life may soon be gone. And even on the political front, uncertainty in the United States over who will run the federal government in a couple of months has also begun to dissipate.    The case for supply: Bottled-up bitcoin    Part of what makes the narratives to the current run-up seem so attractive is they focus on the demand side of the explanation. Yet, as we all know, supply is the other side of the equation. Is there enough bitcoin to slake the thirst of all those new buyers who have entered the market, spurred by economic worries and egged on by analysts?      Months ago, supply was the big topic among those who talk about crypto. Bitcoin was undergoing a halving, whereby rewards given for successfully mining a block were cut in half. That would automatically lead to a surge in prices, went the theory, because there were going to be 900 fewer new bitcoin added to supply every day but there were new buyers added every day. This was back in early May; in the subsequent couple of months bitcoin's price stayed around the $9,000 range. As halvings are known events programmed into bitcoin's code since the very beginning, the market apparently wasn't all too surprised when it actually happened.      Getting back to what else we know, one thing to add to that list is that in China, site of the lion’s share of bitcoin’s hash power, a government crackdown is taking its toll on some of the crypto exchanges that cater to the country’s miners and traders. The crackdown isn’t necessarily about halting crypto but rather trying to stamp out money laundering. It just so happens crypto exchanges are possibly, maybe, suspected in the mix. Thus executives at exchanges have been getting the third degree.      At OKEx, a key executive – literally, the guy who had the keys for OKEx’s addresses – went MIA and only recently resurfaced after spending some time talking to authorities in China. In the meantime, the allegedly Malta-based exchange was forced to halt withdrawals because, obviously, only one person had such keys for one of the world’s largest trading venues and he happened to be in China. It is hoped OKEx has figured out a contingency plan in case someone gets hit by a bus.      Oh, and the date this all started? Oct. 16. That happens to be a couple of days before the price broke out of the trading range between $10,000 and $12,000, where it had bounced around since July.    The case against supply: Business as usual    Then again, just because one can’t withdraw bitcoin from OKEx, that doesn’t mean one can’t trade on it. In fact, open interest on its futures contracts are at $1.22 billion, according to Skew. That’s the biggest open interest figure for any exchange. The CME, for instance, is $200 million smaller.      While bitcoin can neither flow into or out of OKEx, its price is in line with those of its rivals.      “BTC’s price on OKEx is not that different from other exchanges,” Ki Young Ju, chief executive officer of data provider CryptoQuant, told CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen. “…[P]eople can trade their BTC on OKEx despite the withdrawal suspension.”      And miners are finding other venues to unload their newly minted bitcoin; Huobi, Binance and other exchanges seem to be picking up the slack, according to data from Chainalysis. Unfortunately, it hasn’t been Robinhood-easy for some miners to then convert their crypto into fiat (in this case, Chinese yuan) because of the money laundering crackdown.    Stay tuned    The two explanations for bitcoin’s bull run discussed above – new demand and bottled-up supply – are not mutually exclusive. Soon, at least one of them will be put to the test: OKEx is expected to allow withdrawals by Friday of this week.      “With all of the institutional flow around crypto, I don’t think the status of any single exchange is enough to affect prices beyond typical daily volatility,” George Clayton, managing partner of investment firm Cryptanalysis Capital, told CoinDesk’s Daniel Cawrey.      That may very well be the case. We will likely know by the end of this week. When we do, we’ll be finally able to figure out if this is a demand-driven or a supply-driven market. That is, if it was really about there being more buyers or if it was truly about there being fewer sellers.      In the meantime, keep an eye out for when OKEx allows withdrawals again.      – Lawrence Lewitinn    Today's markets    Bitcoin is trading at fresh 35-month highs above $19,000, having defended the psychological support of $18,000 during the Asian trading hours. The crypto market leader is now just 4% short of testing the record high of $19,783.      Hence, most alternative cryptocurrencies, which are still down significantly from their respective lifetime highs, are beginning to look relatively cheap. For instance, ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, is down at least 57% from the peak price of $1,431 reached in January 2018, despite having gained over 50% this month alone.      Should bitcoin's uptrend slow, investors could rotate money to cheap alternative cryptocurrencies. ""During aggressive rallies in the price of bitcoin, market participants sell their alternative cryptocurrencies for bitcoin to capture the upside. Once bitcoin slows down, the capital flows back into alternative cryptocurrencies, and a valuation parity is found,"" Nicholas Pelecanos, head of trading at NEM Ventures, said.      In traditional markets, U.S. stock futures are flashing green while gold and the U..S. dollar are nursing losses. Risk sentiment remains firm on coronavirus vaccine optimism and ebbing political uncertainty in Washington, D.C. President Trump said his aides would cooperate with President-elect Joe Biden's transition to the White House, easing concerns about a drawn-out period of uncertainty.      – Omkar Godbole    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin looks to be replicating moves seen following the 2016 mining reward halving.      The leading cryptocurrency by market value has rallied by $9,000 in the past seven weeks and looks set to challenge the all-time high of $19,783 reached in December 2017.      Notably, the cryptocurrency is closing on record highs 6.5 months following its third mining reward halving, which took place on May 11 this year. Reward halving refers to a programmed 50% reduction in block rewards executed every four years to keep inflation under check.      The latest move toward record highs looks similar to the one seen four years ago.      Bitcoin underwent its second halving on July 9, 2016, when prices were trading near $650. By the end of February 2017, that is, seven months after halving, the cryptocurrency had set a new peak price above the November 2013 high of $1,163.      The rally did not stop there, and the cryptocurrency went on to hit a record price of $19,783, as noted earlier. If history is a guide, bitcoin could see a significant rally in 2021.      Most analysts expect bitcoin to explore the uncharted territory above $20,000 over the next 12 months, courtesy of increasing institutional participation and bitcoin's growing appeal as an inflation hedge.      According to Su Zhu, CEO of Three Arrows Capital, $36,000 is the level to watch out for once the cryptocurrency establishes a foothold above $20,000.      ""This [$36,000] is the strike with the largest bitcoin open interest on Deribit exchange, the dominant market leader in bitcoin and ether-settled options trading,"" Zhu tweeted.      – Omkar Godbole    What's hot  Ethereum 2.0 Deposit Contract Secures Enough Funds to Launch (CoinDesk)  PayPal CEO Schulman Says He’s Bullish on Bitcoin as a Currency (CoinDesk)  XRP Price Surges to 2-Year High as Airdrop Frenzy Builds (CoinDesk)  Australian Investment Group With Billions in AUM Starts Investing in Bitcoin Futures (CoinDesk)  IRS Again Warns Crypto Investors They Under-Reported Gains (CoinDesk)  Analogs  The latest on the economy and traditional finance  Biden to name Yellen to Treasury to lead U.S. from sharp economic downturn (Reuters) President-elect Joe Biden is expected to nominate former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen as U.S. Treasury secretary, breaking a 231-year gender barrier and putting a seasoned economist and labor market expert in charge of leading the country out of the steepest downturn since the Great Depression.

Per a tweet by ETH 2.0 Researcher Justin Drake, Ethereum 2.0’s Beacon Chain’s launch has been set for Dec. 1 at 12:00 UTC.      The backbone of Ethereum 2.0, the Beacon chain is an interim blockchain that will operate alongside the current network as it begins the first of four migration phases to the new network.      Yesterday, the deposit contract for the Beacon chain received the minimum ETH necessary to lock in Eth 2.0’s “genesis day” of Dec. 1.      Read more: Ethereum 2.0 Deposit Contract Secures Enough Funds to Launch      All of Ethereum 2.0’s primary implementations have agreed upon the same “genesis state root” of the new blockchain – or, its precise origins in the code.      “I would say we are comfortably half-way through the overall effort to make Eth 2 feature complete,” Drake told CoinDesk over direct message. “The research (which lasted years!) is largely done and the phase 0 genesis is definitely a significant implementation milestone. Phase 0 lays the heavy-duty foundations (signatures, Merkleisation, networking, Eth 1 deposits, randomness, PoS, etc.). Many of the upcoming hard forks will layer relatively thin infrastructure on top of these foundations.”      As for the rest of the bootstrapping phases, Drake said the second to last one — the full merging of Ethereum 1.0’s blockchain and ecosystem of tokens and applications into Ethereum 2.0 — will require “significant engineering and [will be] very coordination heavy.”      When asked for a rough date for Ethereum 2.0’s launch, Drake told CoinDesk that he has been, at times, “both too optimistic and too pessimistic,” so his target should be taken with “a huge grain of salt.” That said, Drake anticipates that Ethereum 2.0 could be “feature ready” by mid 2023.

The non-custodial cryptocurrency exchange, whose operations run on the Ethereum blockchain, announced Tuesday it plans to expand to the Binance Smart Chain and Polkadot networks. Hence, every holder of IDEX’s Ethereum tokens will get an equivalent number of IDEX tokens for each of the new chains.      ""If you think about it from a business perspective for us, we're thinking about, where can we give customers new networks to trade?"" IDEX CEO Alex Wearn told CoinDesk in a phone interview.      While it remains to be seen whether volume on the new smart contract chains can ever compete with that on Ethereum, IDEX is taking these measures ""so we can put a stake in the ground and plant our flag early,"" Wearn said.      The new tokens will be distributed on Dec. 7 and IDEX holders will need to claim them promptly or they will revert to a community fund whose use will be determined later. Wearn said he expects IDEX trading to go live on the new chains early in 2021, optimally both in the first quarter.      IDEX aims to be a non-custodial exchange that can compete with fully centralized ones. To that end, it takes a hybrid approach where it centralizes trade executions and decentralizes settlement and storage. Wearn said its design reflects a commitment to keeping user assets out of IDEX's control.    The design is also meant to offer many of the features that centralized exchanges can but decentralized exchanges (DEXs) so far largely cannot, such as high-speed order matching. (IDEX tokens are used for stakinghttps://idex.io/document/IDEX-2-0-Whitepaper-2019-10-31.pdf by the nodes that validate transactions on the exchange's off-chain ledger; validators are paid for their work in additional tokens, and can lose their stake if they misbehave.)    The company intends to expand to other chains as it makes sense to do so, but is starting with Polkadot and Binance Smart Chain because both are fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).      More details remain to be worked out for Polkadot than Binance Smart Chain. On the latter, Panama-based IDEX is basically ready to go, with some details on the application side still to be worked out.      To be clear: IDEX’s move does not signal the arrival of seamless trades across chains. A user who wants to trade, say, ether (ETH, the native token of Ethereum) for a token that’s only available on the Binance chain would first need to move the ETH through a “bridge” to the latter.

Tuesday, Newbery and fellow Bitcoin Optech associate Mike Schmidt unveiled Brink, with prolific Bitcoin technical writer Dave Harding joining the board as independent director. Brink will dole out grants to developers working on Bitcoin projects, as well as help fledgling Bitcoin developers embark with fellowships and mentoring.      Newbery told CoinDesk he launched Brink to ""further decentralize Bitcoin development funding"" and to onboard and mentor new contributors ""which hasn't been a priority for other funding organizations.""      Investors John Pfeffer and Wences Casares are providing ""organization funding,"" while the non-profit Human Rights Foundation, Square Crypto, and crypto exchange Gemini are funding the first two fellows; Bitcoin exchange Kraken is funding the first grant.      A huge reason bitcoin works as a global currency at all is that developers are constantly tinkering under the hood to build and test its underlying infrastructure. Traditionally, these developers have done this work out of passion in their spare time without a paycheck.      But things are changing as more and more organizations are looking to pay Bitcoin developers. Last summer alone, at least half a dozen companies in the space announced new grants for developers.      Read more: BitcoinACKS Lets You 'Sponsor' Bitcoin Development    Fueling Bitcoin development by donations    Brink's funding model is a bit experimental. For the most part, Bitcoin organizations such as Chaincode and Square Crypto tend to distribute grants directly to developers from their own central funding pools.      Brink's model is unique in that funding comes from donations from diverse sources.      There might be companies that want to support Bitcoin development but that don't want to have to vet developers to fund. Instead, these organizations can donate to Brink, which will vet and train developers.

42385193,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnXHH,1606222805,CoinDesk Is Spinning Up an Ethereum 2.0 Node. Here's How to Follow Our Journey,"UPDATE (Feb. 3, 12:31 UTC): This article has been updated with information about CoinDesk’s validator node which is now being hosted on Amazon Web Services, not with staking-as-a-service provider Bison Trails.      CoinDesk just snagged a front-row seat to a seminal event in the crypto industry. Ticket price: 32 ETH.      As a media outlet covering nascent technologies, we believe we can sometimes chronicle their development more effectively by participating in them. To that end, we’re spinning up a validator for the upcoming launch of Ethereum 2.0 as part of a fact-finding mission. This required us to acquire the minimum amount of ETH (for about $15,000) to stake on the new network.      Read more: Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain Goes Live as ‘World Computer’ Begins Long-Awaited Overhaul      The goal is to deepen CoinDesk’s editorial coverage to better serve our readers. Running our own validator will give us a direct, real-time window onto Ethereum’s transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. We will gain an unvarnished perspective on the network at its most untested and potentially vulnerable phase of development, gleaning vital insights about the process for our audience.      The launch of Ethereum 2.0 marks the beginning of the network’s transformation into the world’s largest proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol by market capitalization. The pivot to PoS is intended to radically improve network scalability, which throughout Ethereum’s history has been an ongoing pain point for both users and developers.      To be clear, this is not the start of a day-trading division within our newsroom (and for the record, we have strict limitations on such activity). All profits from running the validator will be donated to a charity of our choosing once transfers of ether are enabled in phase 1.5 of the network’s development, roughly a year and a half from now.      We’re also paying out a cut of our staking rewards in modest fees to host our infrastructure on Amazon Web Services. There were a number of security considerations that made it more feasible and reliable for us to run this set-up on the cloud as opposed to our own hardware – the realities of a remote workforce in time of global pandemic being one of them.      You can follow us on our staking journey as an Ethereum 2.0 validator by signing up for our free, limited-run newsletter, Valid Points. Each week, starting the week of the Ethereum 2.0 launch (expected around early December), our emails will feature high-level statistics and charts illustrating the health of our validator and network operations. We’ll also discuss the wider ramifications of the network’s development progress for industry stakeholders (no pun intended) and investors.      For real-time updates on the status of the CoinDesk Eth 2.0 validator, you can find that information on BeaconScan or beaconcha.in by searching up our public validator key. It is: 0xad7fef3b2350d220de3ae360c70d7f488926b6117e5f785a8995487c46d323ddad0f574fdcc50eeefec34ed9d2039ecb.      Sign up for Valid Points today.    Getting into investors' heads    Crucially, this is not just a story about code and network design. This is also an investor story.      We believe having skin in the game puts us in a unique position to adopt the mindset of existing and prospective investors. That’s important because the decision to stake or not involves a trade-off. Should I tie up my funds in a validator node or should I earn interest on them via a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending app?      The pros and cons of such decisions will vary due to a host of factors. We are looking forward to exploring the ever-shifting cost-benefit analysis that investors go through in this environment by putting ourselves in their shoes.      Many questions remain, including how exactly Ethereum will merge into Ethereum 2.0, what impact the merger will have on Ethereum’s growing DeFi ecosystem and the extent to which Ethereum 2.0 will solve the platform's congestion issues over the long run.

42385199,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnXMJ,1606210632,XRP Price Surges to 2-Year High as Airdrop Frenzy Builds,"XRP has chalked up an impressive rally to two-year highs in the last few days, and a coming airdrop may be driving the gains.      Trading around $0.70 at the time of writing, the world's third-largest cryptocurrency by market value is up 130% from lows near $0.30 seen on Saturday. Prices reached a high of $0.79 earlier on Tuesday, the highest level since May 10, 2018, according to the CoinDesk 20.      On-chain activity has picked up the pace alongside the price rally, with the new account activations on the XRP Ledger rising more than 200% to a record high of 5,562 in the past five days, according to data source XRPScan.      Analysts are associating the surge in XRP's price and other metrics with the smart contract platform Flare Network's airdrop of ""spark"" tokens to XRP holders.      The free distribution of 45 billion spark tokens, based on a snapshot of XRP addresses on Dec. 12, is supported by Ripple’s investment arm RippleX (formerly Xpring).      ""The impending airdrop is supercharging the XRP bull market and whipping mindshare of one of the largest crypto communities into a frenzy,"" according to Jehan Chu, a managing partner at Hong Kong-based blockchain investment firm Kenetic Capital. ""With the imminent launch of Flare, a smart contract utility fork of XRP, the pair will attempt to challenge Ethereum’s dominance in decentralized finance and decentralized applications.""      Flare integrates with Ethereum's Virtual Machine, allowing existing Ethereum decentralized applications (dapps) to be ported over to Flare to serve the XRP ecosystem.    Some of the major cryptocurrency exchangeshttps://flare.xyz/supporting-exchanges/, including South Korea's Bithumb and Luxembourg-based Bitstamp, have announced support for the token drop.  XRP inflows spike    Exchange inflows of XRP have soared alongside the price rally, suggesting increased selling pressure in the market.      Nearly 2.3 billion XRP, worth nearly $1 billion, have been transferred to cryptocurrency exchanges since Saturday. That's more than three times the average daily inflow seen in 2019, according to blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis.      Investors typically transfer coins to exchanges when they want to liquidate their holdings, boosting supply in the market, and take direct custody of coins when prices are expected to rally.      According to Chainalysis economist Philip Gradwell, the inflow rise doesn't necessarily imply an imminent sell-off.      Also read: XRP Rises More Than 30% as Altcoins Piggyback on Bitcoin's Wave      ""Demand has been strong so far, with median trade intensity twice the average,"" Gradwell tweeted.

The Hong Kong-based crypto firm received preliminary approval from the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) for two financial licenses that govern how payment companies operate and what services they can provide.      Crypto.com could soon start offering payment services and issue e-money as a licensed financial institution with MFSA oversight. It could additionally execute, custody and deal in-house with customers’ crypto assets as one of the first-ever holders of a Class 3 Virtual Financial Assets license from Malta.      But the licenses are only granted in principle for now. Crypto.com Chief Executive Kris Marszalek told CoinDesk they will become full licenses once the company satisfies a set of MFSA conditions. He refused to elaborate on what those conditions are or when they will be met.      Assuming they are, Crypto.com could be well-positioned to deal across a continental bloc in the midst of expanding its crypto licensure regime. The European Commission recently proposed a comprehensive framework for cryptocurrencies called Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) that would impact the entire European Union.      State-level actions on crypto regulation have generally been harder to come by. But Marszalek said Malta is one of the few countries with “clear regulations on crypto.” Notably, Binance was said to have been based in Malta until MFSA announced in February 2020 that the crypto exchange was “not authorized” to operate there.      The licenses “will allow us competitive advantage to non-licensed firms.” Additionally, it could “possibly grandfather us into the pan-European digital assets legislation which is currently being reviewed,” Marszalek said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/11/24/cryptocom-takes-steps-toward-financial-licensure-in-malta,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e64c32cc9eed778a957b415cb7bacffe8cf657dd-1500x843.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385194,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnXL3,1606185961,Ethereum 2.0 Deposit Contract Secures Enough Funds to Launch,"The smart contract required for triggering the first phase of Ethereum 2.0 has enough funds to begin activation of Ethereum's most ambitious upgrade yet, which will radically shift Ethereum’s economic model, resource usage and governance.      The Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract, which was released in early November, has accrued more than 540,000 ETH (worth over $325 million) late Monday night, ensuring that the beacon chain for Ethereum 2.0 will launch next week, formally beginning the second-largest cryptocurrency's shift from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake one in hopes of solving a number of issues, including scalability.      The Ethereum Foundation had previously set a soft launch date for Dec. 1, assuming the deposit contract saw 524,288 ETH staked by Nov. 24. It hit the target with hours to spare, after more than 150,000 ETH were deposited in a 24-hour period.      The last 25% of the ETH needed to trigger the contract was deposited in four hours. The contract held just 385,440 ETH as of 22:45 UTC on Monday.      Ethereum saw its price rise nearly 10% over a 24-hour period Monday, surpassing $600 for the first time in two years.    Beacon chain    To be clear, the network itself isn’t launching just yet. The launch of Ethereum 2.0 will activate a parallel proof-of-stake blockchain dubbed “the beacon chain” to run in parallel alongside the existing Ethereum network. The initial phases of its development will not impact existing users and decentralized applications on Ethereum.      The primary stakeholders of the beacon chain at Ethereum 2.0 launch will be validators, the equivalent to miners on a proof-of-stake network. Like miners, validators earn rewards on the network in exchange for processing transactions and creating new blocks. In order to become an Ethereum 2.0 validator, a user must stake a minimum of 32 ETH through the deposit contract.      Read more: Everything You Need to Know About Ethereum 2.0      At the outset of the network, validators are expected to earn roughly a 20% annualized reward on their staked ETH. More than 21,000 validators will be securing the network at launch.      The beacon chain activation is the first of four phases of the Ethereum 2.0 migration, which begins with the onboarding of validators and eventually leads to the full transition of all users and dapps to the new network. There are several theories on how the crypto markets will react to the dual blockchain system of Ethereum in the interim before the full migration is complete.      Speaking to the uncertainty, Danny Ryan, Ethereum 2.0 coordinator and Ethereum Foundation developer, told CoinDesk in an interview back in July: “I very much believe that [Ethereum 2.0] adds a ton over time to the intrinsic value of the system … I think that crypto markets are pretty wild and new and people have trouble figuring out how to value these things but in terms of intrinsic value [Ethereum 2.0] is an incredible upgrade that is going to enable Ethereum to be the backbone of a decentralized internet.”",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING,"Nikhilesh De, Christine Kim, Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/24/ethereum-20-deposit-contract-secures-enough-funds-to-launch,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2bc8d22c570ff6aabdaf869204493743edb2491d-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385179,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnX5x,1606176738,IRS Again Warns Crypto Investors They Under-Reported Gains,"For the second year in a row, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is warning cryptocurrency investors they underreported their holdings. But it may be another false alarm.      “Dozens of individuals” recently received notices they owe taxes on gains from crypto holdings they did not report when filing in 2018, according to a blog post published Monday by tax software provider CryptoTrader.tax.      Shehan Chandrasekera, head of tax strategy at CoinTracker, said he'd also heard of crypto investors receiving these letters this year.      The form CP2000 letters state how much the IRS believes the users owe and provide due dates for payment. However, the users likely never realized these gains, and don’t actually owe these funds, CryptoTrader.tax said.      Similar letters were sent to crypto exchange users last year. At the time, Justin Woodward, the co-founder of TaxBit, another software vendor, told CoinDesk people received letters because their exchanges reported transactions to the IRS using form 1099-K. This IRS form shows all transactions as generating revenue, even if some transactions actually resulted in a loss for the user.      As a result, an exchange might report a dramatically inflated tax burden for the user. The letters sent in 2019 were for the 2017 tax year.      The same issue appears to be occurring this year, according to CryptoTrader’s blog post.      “These CP2000 cryptocurrency-related tax mishaps all stem from the fact that Coinbase and other exchanges use Form 1099K to report crypto proceeds to the IRS. This is a problem,” the blog post said.      According to a photo on CryptoTrader's blog post, at least one Coinbase user is definitely affected. It is unclear whether users from other exchanges are also receiving these letters.      Users who receive one of these forms should calculate their actual gains and losses, and report those to the IRS, the post said.      Exchanges could prevent this issue by sending 1099-B forms, which accurately mark gains and losses, to the IRS rather than the merchant-focused 1099-K forms, TaxBit’s other co-founder, Austin Woodward, told CoinDesk in March.      At the time, he said that “there was never any clear IRS guidance that [the 1099-K] was the correct form.”      Spokespersons for the IRS and Coinbase did not immediately return requests for comment.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/24/irs-again-warns-crypto-investors-they-under-reported-gains,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/75c6cd6425985144f889ee9d3b8e12e67f5eaf1b-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
