A dollar-cost-averaging strategy is key, as exemplified by Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy, meaning Bitcoin is a buy at any price. Institutional inflows from ETFs and corporate treasury strategies, alongside the 2024 Bitcoin halving, create a favorable opportunity for accumulation. Despite criticisms, Bitcoin's growing 'hodler' base and nation-state interest suggest an opportunity for a parabolic price period in 2025, making it a buy even at all-time highs. Prelude The digital asset Bitcoin USD (BTC-USD) has continued to break new all-time highs after Trump's victory and the sweeping 'Red Wave' led to optimism of a looser regulatory environment and whispers of a 'Strategic Bitcoin Reserve' . I last wrote about bitcoin in an article titled Becoming A Bitcoiner: Understanding Blockchain Technology And Metcalfe's Law. In that article, I described Blockchain technology and the difficulty of valuing disruptive new technologies. I rated Bitcoin a buy due largely to the continued increase in mining hash rate, signaling the ongoing acceptance of the Bitcoin network. Today, I am reiterating my Buy rating on a rapid improvement in fundamentals due to Trump's victory. My articles on Bitcoin are titled 'Becoming a Bitcoiner' because they document my continued education into Bitcoin and what makes this asset trade the way it does. ""Bitcoiners"" are the hardcore believers in blockchain technology and its capacity to change life as we know it. They believe Bitcoin is heralding in a new digital age where we can transact on the internet with a trustless digital native currency. Bitcoiners see Bitcoin as a currency. They believe that it is a buy at any price because it's simply better to hold over most time frames than cash is. With this in mind, I return to the title of this article: buying at all-time highs is an integral part of being (and becoming) a Bitcoiner. This is mostly because Bitcoiners believe you should always be buying Bitcoin. The dollar-cost-averaging approach is useful for retail investors and institutions alike. The largest individual holder of Bitcoin (besides the creator Satoshi Nakamoto), Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy ( MSTR ), is the most prominent example of this approach. Saylor is the loudest proponent of Bitcoin that I'm aware of, and his shift to holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset instead of cash has been enormously beneficial to shareholders. Many skeptics will still be hesitant to buy at all-time highs, though. Such a volatile asset is due for a correction, right? In this article, let's discuss the factors that, I believe, will contribute to continued parabolic returns in Bitcoin. In fact, I believe the next time we see a material correction in Bitcoin, it may be 'correcting' to a price far higher than where we're at now. Despite being at all-time highs, it is still a very opportune time to accumulate bitcoin. Supply-Demand Dynamics The most widely understood benefit of Bitcoin over fiat money is its fixed supply. In all Economics 101 courses, students are taught that the balance between supply and demand dictates pricing behavior in free and open markets. For many years, demand for Bitcoin was generated from a small subset of enthusiasts, cypherpunks, and criminals. Bitcoin's first commercial use case was on the dark web marketplace the 'Silk Road' where many people bought and sold illegal goods. Much of the bitcoin within this marketplace was seized by the US government, who still holds those coins. It later became viewed as the leading indicator for bull runs across the broader cryptosphere, such as the ICO (initial coin offering) boom of 2017, the NFT (non-fungible token) boom of 2021, and more recently the memecoin boom in 2024. Through each of these periods, Bitcoin undergoes intense upward price movements that re-baseline it at higher highs and higher lows. Data by YCharts I believe we are at the onset of another period of intense upward price performance in Bitcoin because of increased institutional participation amidst the ever-slowing supply that is baked into the core of Bitcoin's Blockchain. Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy made headlines by announcing that the company plans to secure another $42b in new funding for Bitcoin purchases over the next three years. Block, Inc. ( SQ ) also purchases Bitcoin monthly using 10% of its gross profit from Bitcoin products. Block is also working on a leading-edge mining chip and has a leading self-custody hardware wallet known as Bitkey. Additionally, ETFs from major institutions like BlackRock ( BLK ) and Fidelity ( FNF ) have spurred major inflows and purchases of bitcoin. The approval of these ETFs earlier in 2024 already caused a significant run in the price of bitcoin. Meanwhile, Microsoft ( MSFT ) has an open proposal for shareholders to vote on Bitcoin purchasing plans. Even though management has recommended shareholders vote against this, it's indicative of a broader acceptance and conversation around bitcoin being used as a treasury asset. Shareholders like Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street ( STT ) will be eligible to vote on the proposal in December, all of whom now have a vested interest in increasing the rate of Bitcoin adoption. Increasing institutional ownership of bitcoin also comes at a time when some nations have begun accepting bitcoin as legal tender. Meanwhile, a recent Chainalysis report shows an increasing number of participants in the crypto sphere. The confluence of factors contributing to demand growth for bitcoin is powerful. When taken in tandem with the 2024 Bitcoin halving cutting supply growth in half and the optimism around a pro-crypto Trump administration, this is nothing short of a golden opportunity to accumulate bitcoin. The loudest criticism of bitcoin is a lack of use cases. Critics say that it is still valueless, since it doesn't have the same transactional utility as fiat money or store-of-value utility like gold or silver. Frankly, this doesn't matter. What matters is an increasing number of 'hodlers' (the bitcoiner term for someone that buys and holds bitcoin with no intent of ever selling), increasing institutional adoption, and increasing adoption by nation-states. The increasingly loud rhetoric around a US strategic reserve of Bitcoin has the potential of setting off another parabolic period for the price of bitcoin. From the nation-state perspective, bitcoin ownership is a matter of game theory. It's risky to be the first mover, but it is equally risky to be a laggard. If the US begins accumulating bitcoin, virtually all other nations will have the incentive to accumulate bitcoin, since their US Dollar reserves will now be linked to bitcoin by proxy. Some analysts believe this could help the US pay down its exploding national debt, but I won't pontificate on that at this time. Investor Takeaway Regardless of your opinion on blockchain technology or cryptocurrency, it's dangerous to bet against basic economics. Bitcoin's economic reality currently features exploding demand and slowing supply. With the confluence of factors contributing to strong demand growth, I expect another parabolic period for the price of Bitcoin in 2025. The next 'correction' will likely be a 'higher low' from where we are now (or *to* where we are now). Regardless, it remains an opportune time to accumulate bitcoin, even if for a momentum trade. Bitcoin remains a buy despite hitting all-time highs.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4736611-becoming-a-bitcoiner-buying-at-all-time-highs?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36204623.jpeg
36204558,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652744,1731455952,BitMEX Founder Predicts How Bitcoin Goes To $1 Million Under Trump,"In his latest essay titled “Black or White?”Arthur Hayes, co-founder and former CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX, lays out an analysis predicting that Bitcoin could soar to $1 million. Hayes argues that forthcoming US economic policies under the second term of Donald Trump could set the stage for unprecedented Bitcoin growth. Hayes draws parallels between the economic strategies of the United States and China, coining the term “American Capitalism with Chinese Characteristics.” He suggests that, similar to China’s approach under Deng Xiaoping and continued by Xi Jinping, the US is moving toward a system where the government’s primary goal is to retain power, regardless of whether policies are capitalist, socialist, or fascist. Why The Fiat System Is Broken “Similar to Deng, the elite that rule Pax Americana care not whether the economic system is Capitalist, Socialist, or Fascist, but whether implemented policies help them retain their power,” Hayes writes. He emphasizes that America ceased being purely capitalist in the early 20th century, noting, “Capitalism means that the rich lose money when they make bad decisions. That was outlawed as early as 1913 when the US Federal Reserve was created.” Hayes critiques the historical shift from “trickle-down economics” to direct stimulus measures, particularly those implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. He distinguishes between “QE for the rich” and “QE for the poor,” highlighting how direct stimulus to the general population spurred economic growth, whereas quantitative easing primarily benefited wealthy asset holders. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Blasts Through $82,000: These Are The Key Reasons “From 2Q2020 until 1Q2023, Presidents Trump and Biden bucked the trend. Their Treasury departments issued debt that the Fed purchased using printed dollars (QE), but instead of handing it out to rich [individuals], the Treasury mailed checks out to everyone,” he explains. This led to a decrease in the US debt-to-nominal GDP ratio, as the increased spending power of the average citizen stimulated real economic activity. Looking ahead, Hayes anticipates that Trump’s return to power will usher in policies focused on re-shoring critical industries to the US, financed by expansive government spending and bank credit growth. He references Scott Bassett, whom he believes will be Trump’s pick for Treasury Secretary, noting that Bassett’s speeches outline plans to “run nominal GDP hot by providing government tax credits and subsidies to re-shore critical industries.” “The plan is to run nominal GDP hot by providing government tax credits and subsidies to re-shore critical industries (shipbuilding, semiconductor fabs, auto manufacturing, etc.). Companies that qualify will then receive cheap bank financing,” Hayes states. He warns that such policies would lead to significant inflation and currency debasement, adversely affecting holders of long-term bonds or savings deposits. To hedge against this, Hayes advocates for investing in assets like Bitcoin and gold. “Instead of saving in fiat bonds or bank deposits, purchase gold (the boomer financial repression hedge) or Bitcoin (the millennial financial repression hedge),” he advises. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Be Ready For ‘Phase 2’ Of This Historical Bull Pattern Hayes supports his argument by analyzing the mechanics of monetary policy and bank credit creation. He illustrates how “QE for the poor” can stimulate economic growth through increased consumer spending, as opposed to “QE for the rich,” which inflates asset prices without contributing to real economic activity. “QE for poor people stimulates economic growth. The Treasury handing out stimmies encouraged the plebes to buy trucks. Due to the demand for goods, Ford was able to pay its employees and apply for a loan to increase production,” he elaborates. Furthermore, Hayes discusses potential regulatory changes, such as exempting banks from the Supplemental Leverage Ratio (SLR), which would enable them to purchase an unlimited amount of government debt without additional capital requirements. He argues that this would pave the way for “infinite QE” directed at productive sectors of the economy. “If Treasuries, central bank reserves, and/or approved corporate debt securities were exempted from the SLR, a bank could purchase an infinite amount of debt without having to encumber themselves with any expensive equity,” he explains. “The Fed has the power to grant an exemption. They did just that from April 2020 to March 2021.” How Bitcoin Could Reach $1 Million Hayes believes that the combination of aggressive fiscal policies and regulatory changes will result in an explosion of bank credit, leading to higher inflation and a weakening US dollar: The combination of legislated industrial policy and the SLR exemption will result in a gusher of bank credit. I have already shown how the monetary velocity of such policies is much higher than that of traditional QE for rich people overseen by the Fed. Therefore, we can expect that Bitcoin and crypto will perform as well, if not better, than they did from March 2020 until November 2021. In such an environment, he asserts that Bitcoin stands to benefit the most due to its scarcity and decentralized nature. “This is how Bitcoin goes to $1 million, because prices are set on the margin. As the freely traded supply of Bitcoin dwindles, the most fiat money in history will be chasing a safe haven,” he predicts. Hayes backs this claim by referencing his custom index that tracks US bank credit supply, demonstrating that Bitcoin has outperformed other assets when adjusted for bank credit growth. “What is [..] important is how an asset performs when deflated by the supply of bank credit. Bitcoin (white), the S&P 500 Index (gold), and gold (green) have all been divided by my bank credit index. The values are indexed to 100, and as you can see, Bitcoin is the standout performer, rising over 400% since 2020. If you can only do one thing to counter the fiat debasement, it is Bitcoin. You can’t argue with the math,” he asserts. In concluding his essay, Hayes urges investors to position themselves accordingly in anticipation of these macroeconomic shifts. “Get long, and stay long. If you doubt my analysis of the impact of QE for poor people, just read up on the Chinese economic history of the past thirty years, and you will understand why I call the new economic system of Pax Americana, “American Capitalism with Chinese Characteristics,” he advises. At press time, BTC traded at $87,660.

42435379,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kpAeI,1731450973,‘Just Don’t Break’ Bitcoin: Devs Debate Tech Upgrades to Top Crypto,"BOSTON –– Most of the world focuses on bitcoin {{BTC}}’s zipping price. Not so for the 100-odd bitcoiners who gathered at Fidelity Investments’ headquarters over the weekend.  They were preoccupied with helping the original cryptocurrency conquer the world – and meantime avoid getting wrecked.  “This is about getting bitcoin to the next billion people,” said Will Foxley, emcee of OP_NEXT, what he claimed was the first bitcoin scaling conference in five years.  OP_NEXT is the newest anomaly on crypto’s overstuffed conference circuit. It's got none of the retail-friendly bravado of Bitcoin Nashville. It lacks the corporate booths that dot ETH Denver. Few of its speakers shilled their crypto-business ventures, as nearly everyone did at Solana’s rebooted Breakpoint.  Instead, dozens of hoodie-wearing coder boys (and a handful of women) debated improvements that might make bitcoin more useful, usable, and even resilient against faraway problems that could one day upend the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency.  “Either we aggressively pursue innovation and progress as quickly as possible or we will eventually be replaced,” said Paul Sztorc of bitcoin developer company Layer2 Labs.  Bitcoin famously lacks a singular decision-making authority. Proposed upgrades need to find consensus among the community's many stakeholders, and eventually adoption by the miners who run the computers that run the blockchain. No one quite knows how to know when consensus is reached.  “I know it when I see it,” quipped Colin Harper, the conference host as Blockspace Media’s editor-in-chief (he and Foxley are former CoinDesk reporters).  Soft forks  The two most recent soft forks, or backward-compatible upgrades, helped bitcoin move beyond simply shifting “digital gold” between wallets. Nowadays, network transactions are filled with primitive versions of the wacky crypto-financial wizardry pioneered on Ethereum and other smart contract-centric blockchains. Future soft forks could give this kind of innovation a boost.  While many developers regularly propose upgrades, none have succeeded since Taproot was activated in 2021, and Segwit in 2017 before it. Ossification is starting to set in to Bitcoin Core (the basic open-source software for wallets and nodes), some attendees said. Can bitcoin continue to evolve? Technically, of course. But should it?  ”People got scared about soft forks unnecessarily because the last two soft forks were large,” said Brandon Black, engineering manager at Swan Bitcoin, a brokerage and custodian. “We should get in the habit” of improving bitcoin.  OP_Next attendees were decidedly in favor of progress – but not too much progress, and certainly not too fast. When one audience member shouted support for pushing regular software upgrades to Bitcoin Core, an entire panel of bitcoin developers scoffed. One jokingly retorted, “soft forks every day!”  Proposed soft forks percolate up from the bitcoiner community. They undergo study and debate, and if they find sufficient interest, get a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) number. From there, they face more debates, security reviews, debates, and also debates. BIPs that win community consensus (whatever that means) must then be activated as a soft fork – a mechanism that itself is up for debate.  Covenants and OP_CAT  One unresolved debate is over covenants, a feature that would allow bitcoin holders to hard-code restrictions into how their BTC is spent. Bitcoin developer Jeremy Rubin has long advocated for covenants, winning some fans and many doubters. In 2021 his proposal called CheckTemplateVerify received a BIP number. Then, amid the louder debate over implementing Taproot, momentum for Rubin’s covenants proposal stalled out.  “‘Bitcoin review is kind of like the eye of Sauron,'” Rubin said he heard from one detractor at the time. “‘It can see everything but only one thing at a time.'”  By his telling, Rubin then declared himself “champion of Taproot activation” in the battle to get the last successful soft fork over the finish line. People simply couldn’t “agree on consensus,” he said. Taproot came online in November 2021. Rubin “reevaluated my life choices,” and quit the Bitcoin Core developer team one year later.  A more recent idea actually pulls from bitcoin’s deep past. BIP-347, the OP_CAT proposal, would resurrect a function Satoshi Nakomoto, bitcoin's pseudonymous creator, killed off in 2010 due to security concerns. Nowadays, the function could allow people to essentially write smart contracts on the network.  Such a step forward would put bitcoin closer to par with Ethereum, its largest competitor.  “When I talk to people about CAT, often people will express that they’re worried that other people are opposed to CAT, but I’ve met very few people who themselves are opposed to CAT,” said the proposal’s author, Ethan Heilman.  'Just don't break it'  Most bitcoin investors ""stack sats"" (slang for accumulating) unbothered by debates over bitcoin’s technical future, if they even know those debates exist. Surely that’s because the vast majority only care about its flashiest feature: price.  One of Bitcoin Core’s current contributors, who goes by Portland HODL, posed a question to the auditorium: What’s the one thing every bitcoin investor asks its developers do for bitcoin. Someone yelled: “Number go up!”  “Yeah!” shouted Portland HODL, “Just please don’t break bitcoin for me!”  Still, Portland HODL said he wanted bitcoin future-proofed against looming threats, like quantum computing, and the year 2106 bug, the blockchain's own version of Y2K. He advocated for a janitorial soft fork he calls “the great consensus cleanup.”  Portland HODL was less enthusiastic about soft forks meant to increase bitcoin’s core functionality, such as OP_CAT. These things threaten bitcoin with “unknown unknowns,” he said. And by the way, even as the price soars, block space isn’t filling up to a degree that would indicate the network is hitting its limits.  Even if developers could find consensus over what upgrades they’d like to see, there’s no agreement on how to actually do it. Bitcoin has multiple “activation mechanisms” for soft forks and the only thing people seem to agree about is they didn’t like the way that Taproot and SegWit did it.  Toward the end of the conference, one attendee asked panelists: “Who is the decision maker?”  Everyone laughed.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TRADING | FORKS,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/11/12/just-dont-break-bitcoin-devs-debate-upgrading-tech-behind-top-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b9c4ad47d518f9fff53a2857392cb296b2ecf969-5184x2916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

36200913,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652704,1731450655,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Analyst Sets $320,000 Target As Wave 5 Begins","The Bitcoin price has finally broken out of resistance and is on a journey to the $320,000 threshold, according to a crypto analyst. Notably, the Bitcoin price has now returned into a full bullish sentiment, with the crypto fear and greed index now pointing to extreme greed. In a recent technical analysis, crypto analyst Gert van Lagen identified a bullish pattern in Bitcoin’s price chart, specifically pointing to a confirmed breakout of the classic ‘cup-and-handle’ pattern formation that has essentially kicked off a bullish Wave 5 run. Bitcoin Price Sets Sights On $320,000 As Wave 5 Begins Bitcoin’s price action has been nothing short of impressive in the past few days. Notably, the Bitcoin price has created multiple all-time highs in quick succession, as many investors start to pour in. This sustained demand has created successive bullish candles on both the daily and weekly charts, illustrating a continued strong upward momentum. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price To $1 Soon? Textbook Weekly Golden Cross Shows What’s Coming Next Interestingly, these bullish candle formations have validated what crypto analyst Gert van Lagen called the start of a sub-wave 5 formation. This wave, which is known to be bullish, is expected to be the final sub-wave formation in a larger Elliot wave uptrend that has been in play since January 2023. Supporting the possibility of the wave 5 formation, technical analysis of the Bitcoin price formation shows that the recent price rally has seen Bitcoin breaking out of a cup-and-handle formation. This pattern, which is known to be bullish, has been in formation since 2022. The ‘cup’ portion of this pattern began forming in early 2022 and eventually ended with Bitcoin’s peak above $73,700 in March 2024. The subsequent consolidation phase, which lasted until October, represents the ‘handle’ segment of the pattern. In addition to this, Bitcoin has managed to break free from what van Lagen described as a ‘base 4 step-wise formation,’ effectively shaking off a bear trap. With this breakout now confirmed, van Lagen’s analysis points to a projected target range between $220,000 and $320,000. This range marks what he considers a ‘major sell line,’ which is a zone where profit-taking might intensify as Bitcoin reaches these upper limits. Related Reading: This Crypto Trader Correctly Called Dogecoin Price Break Above $0.3 Back In October, The True Target Will Shock You Current State Of BTC At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $89,500 with a market cap of $1.77 trillion and an all-time high of $89,864, having increased by about 10.5% in the past 24 hours. However, given this trend, this all-time high might not last long. The bullish sentiment and inflow surrounding Bitcoin has been so massive that investors don’t know when to take profit at the moment. The RSI is above 70 on every single timeframe from the daily to the yearly. This shows how strong the buying momentum is at the moment. Nevertheless, the momentum is expected to continue, with the next target at $90,000 and another at $100,000. A move to Gert van Lagen’s target of $220,000 to $320,000 will represent a 145% and 255% increase, respectively, from the current price.

36197055,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652714,1731445242,Dogecoin Price On The Move With $0.4484 Breakout in Bulls’ Crosshairs,"The Dogecoin price is showing signs of renewed bullish momentum as the price sets its sights on the key resistance level of $0.4484. Following a steady rise, the bulls appear determined to push through this barrier, potentially setting the stage for a breakout that could spark further gains. As market sentiment shifts in favor of the buyers, all eyes are on DOGE to see if it can sustain its upward strength and reach this ambitious target. This analysis aims to assess Dogecoin’s uptrend as it approaches the critical $0.4484 resistance level, exploring whether the bulls have the strength to achieve a breakout. By examining current price trends, key technical indicators, and potential support and resistance levels, this piece aims to provide insights into DOGE’s near-term prospects. It will also consider the implications for traders if DOGE successfully breaks through or encounters resistance at this key level. DOGE Bulls Eye Key Resistance At $0.4484 The Dogecoin price has held strong above the 100-day SMA on the 4-hour chart, signaling bullish momentum. After breaking the $0.3563 resistance, DOGE established a support base and now targets $0.4484. This movement suggests buyer control and a breakout at this level could lead to more gains, strengthening the current uptrend and attracting more optimistic interest. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals a sustained upsurge, with the RSI rising to 91% after breaking above the 50% mark, indicating a strengthening buying pressure as the market shifts from a bearish phase to a more neutral or bullish stance. With the bulls firmly in control, this upward momentum suggests the possibility of additional price increases if buying strength continues. Related Reading: Dogecoin To As High As $23? This Pattern Could Hint So Additionally, the daily chart shows that Dogecoin is facing significant upward pressure, as evidenced by the formation of bullish candlestick patterns. The asset’s position above the critical 100-day SMA further supports this positive trend. As DOGE continues on this path, it strengthens the optimistic sentiment in the market, paving the way for additional gains as it targets the $0.4484 mark. Lastly, the RSI on the daily chart is at 92%, signaling strong positive movement after recovering from a dip to 57%, suggesting a shift in market sentiment with increased buying pressure. While the elevated RSI indicates potential for more growth, sustained overbought levels could lead to a correction if buying pressure slows. The Significance Of $0.4484 For The Dogecoin Price The $0.4484 level holds significant importance for the Dogecoin price, as it represents a key resistance point that could trigger a possible breakout. Should Dogecoin successfully surpass this level, it could pave the way for further upward movement, extending the current bullish trend and targeting the next resistance at $0.5920.

However, if the level holds as resistance, DOGE may face a period of consolidation or pullback before making another attempt at breaking through.

The wild swing in crypto prices liquidated over $900 million of leveraged derivatives trading positions across all digital assets, CoinGlass shows.  Ripple's XRP, XLM and HBAR advanced 15%-18% outperforming the CoinDesk 20 Index.  The crypto bull market shows no signs of stopping, with bitcoin {{BTC}} reaching another milestone by hitting the $90,000 level on crypto exchange Coinbase.  The largest crypto retraced around 5% to the low-$85,000 level earlier Tuesday, shaking out some late leveraged buyers. The pullback didn't last long, though, with prices quickly rebounding and clinching a new all-time high of $90,100 on Coinbase's BTC-USD pair towards the later hours of the U.S. session before giving back some of the gains. The CoinDesk Bitcoin Index (XBX), which tracks pricing data from multiple exchanges, hit $89,971 as the price on Coinbase topped $90,000.  The $90,000 level could pose a significant barrier for bitcoin's rise, at least for the short term. On popular crypto exchange Binance, order book data of the most liquid trading pair BTC-USDT showed mounting sell orders at the $90,000 level. Positioning on the options market also suggest that BTC's rise may stall out in the $90,000-$100,000 range.  Indeed, within minutes of reaching the $90,000 level, prices reversed with bitcoin sinking to $88,500, still up 0.9% over the past 24 hours and outperforming the broader CoinDesk 20 Index, which was flat over the same time period.

42435382,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kpAh0,1731442659,How Escape Hatches Can Boost Crypto’s Reputation,"As the impending changes in Washington and the associated jump in token prices have us all gripped, there's another defining moment happening right now in crypto that demonstrates blockchain’s true power. It’s a development that Vitalik heralded on stage at Devcon Tuesday, which could completely reshape how we protect our money in times of crisis, achieving what generations of bankers and lawyers have struggled to do: ensure a smooth, swift return of funds to users when a financial platform shuts down.  Imagine a multi-million-dollar financial application closing its doors, yet every user (as unsecured creditors in the same pool) retrieves their money instantly, without hassle or third-party intervention. That's exactly what happened when the crypto platform dYdX shut off its Ethereum-based operations with $70 million of user funds inside it — only to seamlessly return millions of dollars to its users. No drawn-out legal processes, no waiting periods — just immediate access to funds, as simple as pressing a button.  I’ll give an insight into the cheat-proof feature that achieved this — the Escape Hatch — and outline just how wide its use cases can be. But first, some perspective on why this is a story of blockchain’s relevance for the future of finance, and not just another story of Web3 inside baseball.  This ongoing claims process can be monitored on any Ethereum block explorer and it’s a game-changer for anyone who's ever worried about losing access to their money during a banking crisis or insolvency. Traditionally, in these cases, financial systems often entangle consumers in lengthy, complicated proceedings when things go south. The first use of the Escape Hatch — an event that is ongoing right now — will be recalled as a watershed moment when companies outside of crypto started to appreciate the unique ability of blockchain rails to win consumer confidence.  The Escape Hatch was designed and hardwired into the scaling infrastructure that dYdX was using on Ethereum – StarkEx, which my company StarkWare built and operates. It is a failsafe mechanism to ensure that, in the case of any disruption, funds are accessible to their rightful owners via the Ethereum main-chain (L1), free from administrative red tape and time limits.  Think of any scenario that could normally part you from your funds — the company where you deposit goes bankrupt, is shut down by a government, or aliens abduct its entire staff. The Escape Hatch was built to be exactly what the name suggests — you can open it up and take out your funds. And, on October 28, when dYdX went offline on Ethereum, it worked exactly as intended.  The Escape Hatch can be, and should always be, hardwired into blockchain technology, allowing users to withdraw their assets directly. In dYdX’s case, it was hardwired into its setup on L2. It could equally exist on L3 or, for that matter, L99 if the model of blockchain layers expands prolifically in future. It can work for fully decentralized projects, partly decentralized projects (dYdX used a centralized order book and matching system), or centralized entities operating on blockchain. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin enthusiastically explained the mechanism in his Devcon keynote address today.  He said: “The difference between a Layer 2 and an independent chain is that even if your Layer 2 gets 51% attacks, or 91% attacks, or the team shuts down, Layer 1 still stands there to protect the users. Users are able to prove their assets and their ownership and their state inside of the Layer 2 and migrate it back down to layer one.”  Vitalik then went on to state that “recently, there was a live experiment of this,” discussing the case of dYdX. The audience, impressed by the significance of what he was saying, erupted into spontaneous applause.  Vitalik hammered home the point, saying: “Layer 2s are not just multisigs. The ability to actually move your assets out of Layer 2 and back to Layer 1, if the Layer 2 fails, without the Layer 2 team’s involvement, is not just theory. It is reality.”  Observers will quickly start to realize the Escape Hatch isn’t just a “neat” feature of blockchain. It’s a powerful illustration of why those outside of the blockchain space, whose interest is piqued by the current mood of market exuberance, will find real potential benefits of moving at least parts of their operations on-chain.  All of us who are already in crypto are now in the spotlight, and it’s time to seize it. We have a rare opportunity to capitalize on the attention, take people beyond the headlines, and highlight our relevance. We often find ourselves giving a nail-in-search-of-a-hammer argument for blockchain. The Escape Hatch story is the opposite.  Anyone trying to retrieve money in the aftermath of a bank shutdown or an insolvency knows how excruciating it can be. It’s a perfect example of an area in which, if blockchain can do things better, market forces will ensure that people will want to listen (except for the insolvency lawyers who invoice in their six-minute increments and get paid before creditors).  This type of shutdown on a traditional platform would likely lead to a prolonged distribution process managed by a singular entity. Not only would the process be lengthy, but it would likely be prone to human error.  Even if such a distribution of funds were to go smoothly, it’s entirely possible that customers miss letters or fail to meet deadlines for claiming funds and therefore lose money. As things currently stand, almost every claims process has time limits, after which your money can go to someone else. Money from an emergency release, however, would remain on the blockchain, accessible only by its rightful owner or their descendants, forever.  The use of a failsafe mechanism, where a smart contract distributes funds based on predetermined parameters, could be implemented for a range of consumer use cases and potentially even circumvent or streamline future insolvency proceedings. Blockchain is not here just to make life simpler, richer, more global or more fun – though it can do all of those well – but to increase the integrity level of our interactions. If that most perplexing and troubling of financial realities, liquidation, can be performed in an automated manner in accordance with unmovable and predetermined criteria in line with relevant law, that is a triumph for integrity.  The moment that a business starts operating on blockchain in this way, matters are handled according to predetermined ground rules that are in the code. The business doesn’t need to try to convince consumers that it will do the right thing in the event of catastrophe; the code of the blockchain has their back. Integrity has never been so accessible.  The crypto industry has a bad reputation. Time and time again, it has been embroiled in scandal. A seemingly never-ending stream of negative news stories has seen consumers hurt by bankruptcies, thefts, and the misappropriation of customer funds. It’s gotten to the point where roughly six-in-ten Americans say they have little to no confidence in the current ways to invest, trade or use crypto, per Pew Research Center.  Two years on from the collapse of the centralized crypto exchange FTX, dYdX has demonstrated what blockchain can do when a platform truly embraces “self-custodial” values. We need to become better at communicating to the general public that applications such as FTX were simply masquerading as blockchain applications, with no regard for customers. By stark contrast, others, such as dYdX, exist for the very purpose of better protecting consumers.  In the case of FTX, there were many reports of staff front-running customers to quickly remove their funds from the platform. This simply could never have happened with dYdX due to the codebase — scaled on Ethereum by my company, StarkWare — which kept all customer funds ring-fenced. Consequently, had a dYdX staffer tried to steal funds, it xfwould have been impossible.  Today, when we get into a car, we all fasten our seatbelts. In the United States alone, it is estimated that seatbelts have saved almost 400,000 lives. And yet, when Ford first offered seatbelts as a feature in 1955, they were unpopular: in 1956, only 1 in 50 people paid for them.  It didn’t matter much to the success of Ford. After all, people needed cars, and weren’t discouraged by safety factors. By contrast, those of us in blockchain today desperately need to convince people to use this technology, show its relevance for previously unimagined use cases, and reassure them it’s safe to do so.

36193430,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652726,1731439856,Bitcoin Weekly RSI Entering Power Zone – Last Time BTC Soared 80%,"Bitcoin experienced an explosive surge yesterday, with bulls driving the price to a new all-time high (gain) at $89,980. This relentless uptrend highlights growing optimism among investors as Bitcoin continues to break new ground. Renowned trader and analyst Cheds recently shared a compelling technical insight, noting that Bitcoin’s weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) is nearing the “overbought” zone—historically a very bullish signal for BTC. Entering this zone could indicate heightened demand and momentum, suggesting further upside potential for Bitcoin in the near term. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly Volume Hits $60 Billion As ETH Aims For Yearly Highs The coming days will be critical as investors anticipate a possible pullback to enter fresh positions at lower levels. However, the current price action remains bullish, showing few signs of weakness. If the price holds, it could fuel even greater buying interest, extending Bitcoin’s upward momentum. Cheds’ analysis underscores the strong technical setup for BTC, with RSI nearing a point that could attract more bullish attention. Investors will be watching closely, as any sustained movement in this high momentum phase may set the stage for Bitcoin’s next big leg up. Bitcoin Showing Strength Bitcoin has surged by over 32% in less than a week, with rapid, aggressive moves to new highs reflecting strong market sentiment. Such euphoria often precedes a correction, yet recent data indicates Bitcoin could sustain this upward momentum. Top trader and analyst Cheds recently shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting that Bitcoin’s weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) is nearing the “power zone,” known as the overbought territory. Historically, this zone has signaled powerful bullish phases for BTC. The last time Bitcoin’s RSI reached similar levels, the price rallied from around $40,000 to $70,000, suggesting another substantial surge might be on the horizon. As Bitcoin enters this new bullish phase, a continuation of the uptrend seems likely, but it may not be a straightforward climb. Even in strong bull markets, BTC typically requires periodic pullbacks to consolidate and gather strength for further gains. A healthy retrace would provide necessary support levels and allow BTC to “refuel” before another upward push. This retracement is particularly important in avoiding overstretched conditions that could lead to a more severe correction. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Sees Altseason Potential As BTS Is Still Outpacing ETH – Time To Buy Altcoins? While the current bullish momentum points toward higher levels, traders should anticipate some fluctuations, which are part of a sustainable uptrend. Bitcoin’s ability to hold key support levels during any potential pullback will be crucial for maintaining the overall bullish structure. Bullish Price Action: Key Levels To Watch Bitcoin is trading at $88,000 following two days of unexpected price appreciation, defying analysts’ expectations of a pause around $77,000 and a possible pullback to the previous all-time high of $73,800. Instead, Bitcoin’s price has continued its upward momentum, bringing it closer to the significant psychological level of $90,000. Many investors consider this level a key supply zone where profit-taking could emerge. Despite the rapid climb, market sentiment remains highly bullish, and the price structure suggests that Bitcoin is still targeting the much-anticipated $100,000 milestone. The current price action reflects a strong bullish trend, but a retracement toward the $77,000 level could be a healthy move, allowing BTC to establish a robust demand base. Such a pullback would offer a consolidation phase, which is typical before another major leg-up in a sustained rally.

Stablecoins have steady prices and serve as key trading pairs on exchanges; their growth signals capital inflows to the crypto economy and investor demand for digital assets.  Investors remained on the sidelines heading into the election, then piled into the markets once the results were in, Anagram partner David Shuttleworth said.  Money is piling into the crypto market since the U.S. election, as the rapidly expanding stablecoin supply shows.  The top two leading stablecoins, Tether's USDT {{USDT}} and Circle's USDC {{USDC}} together grew by more than $5 billion during the week since Nov. 5, according to TradingView data. USDT tokens in circulation increased by $3.8 billion over the past week to a new record of $124 billion, TradingView showed. Meanwhile, USDC supply grew by $1.6 billion to nearly $37 billion.  Expansion of the stablecoin supply is bullish for digital assets, indicating capital inflows to the crypto ecosystem. Stablecoins have their price anchored to an external asset, predominantly to the U.S. dollar. They are a popular source of liquidity for crypto trading, serving as ""dry powder"" to buy assets on exchanges. USDT is the most liquid crypto trading pair on off-shore exchanges, while USDC is mostly used on U.S.-focused Coinbase and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.  ""There was a lot of sidelined interest from both retail and institutions leading up to the election,"" David Shuttleworth, partner at Anagram, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. ""Once the results were in, liquidity and buy-side pressure began to pile in.""  One metric that underscores this behavior is the balance of Ethereum-based stablecoins on exchanges. The amount of stablecoins on exchanges declined steadily heading into the election as investors took a ""wait-and-see approach"", Shuttleworth said. Then, following Nov. 5 election, stablecoin balances jumped to a yearly high of $41 billion from around $36 billion in early November, Nansen on-chain data shows, as investors deposited stablecoins pent-up demand for crypto assets  The stablecoin growth happened while activity soared across multiple corners of the digital asset economy as bitcoin {{BTC}} hit record highs on Donald Trump's election victory, and anticipation of a crypto-friendly regime unleashed animal spirits.  Native USDC supply on the Solana {{SOL}} network grew 14% over the past week to nearly $2.9 billion, DefiLlama data shows, as Solana-based DeFi protocols saw a resurgence in transaction volumes and network revenues.

The company maintains strong financial health with $59 million in cash reserves and minimal debt, despite share dilution from equity issuance for AI expansion. Q3 earnings will be crucial to assess AI revenue growth and its impact on overall profitability, especially amidst volatile Bitcoin prices. Bit Digital's strategic diversification into AI and gaming positions it for long-term growth, despite potential short-term stock price pressure from share dilution. Since I last covered Bit Digital (NASDAQ: BTBT ) on November 9, 2023, it is up by more than 90%, an upside not aligned with my Hold position, mainly because I had failed to anticipate the positive momentum imparted to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) by the launch of several spot ETFs in early 2024. Subsequently, as shown in the chart below, the stock slid below $2 around April, justifying my cautionary stance based on the BTC halving event. Data by YCharts My objective with this thesis is to show that further upside is possible based on how its strategic pivot from Bitcoin mining to focus on HPC (high-performance computing) infrastructure is bearing fruit. Also, given that the third quarter (Q3) financial results will probably be announced on November 19, I provide some insights into what to expect. To start with, one year since my last coverage, it is time for an update on how this miner has fared when it comes to its AI diversification strategy. Revenue Surge thanks to AI Diversification At that time, the company had invested approximately $35 million in 132 FusionOne HPC servers equipped with superfast H100 GPUs supplied by NVDIA ( NVDA ). These were used to build AI infrastructure for leasing to supersmart application developers as part of a hosting agreement expected to generate about $50 million in annualized revenue. This shift came amid the rising mining difficulty and the looming Bitcoin halving event, prompting the management to avoid concentrating capital on depreciating mining equipment. Looking into the execution, as of early 2024, the company reported an annualized revenue run-rate of approximately $50 million from its HPC segment, led by a key customer contract. Also, as a result of its strategic AI priorities, it has experienced significant growth as seen in the quarterly revenue chart below. Data by YCharts Looking deeper, in June 2024, it generated around $4.1 million in revenue from its AI operations consisting of 256 servers, contributing to a strong overall financial performance which helped to offset the revenue short falls due to the Bitcoin halving event where rewards were cut from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC for each block mined. Thus, for the second quarter of 2024 (Q2), only 244.2 bitcoins were produced, or a 23% YoY decrease, but still, mining revenues increased by 80% YoY to $16.1 million , driven by higher asset prices. Assessing for the diversification success, HPC-related sales were $12.5 million during Q2 compared to nil the prior year. Adding $0.37 million from Ethereum staking, total revenue was $29.0 million, or a whopping 220% YoY increase. Looking at Capital Allocation needed to Support AI Growth Looking ahead, the aim is to achieve $100 million in annualized revenue from AI by the end of 2024, supported by an expanded contract including additional GPUs. To reach this ambitious goal will involve significantly expanding its computational capabilities with the installed GPU base climbing to 4,096 units, up from the 2,048 GPUs in mid-2024. Now, at $25K each, Nvidia's advanced parallel chips cost a lot of money, and it is important to check the capital allocation strategy. In this respect, as seen in the chart below, the financial position is relatively strong with substantial cash reserves of $59 million versus only $2 million of debt/lease obligations. Data by YCharts Moreover, while Bit Digital's sizeable equity issuance as shown in the above pale blue chart to fund its AI expansion has surely diluted its shares, but the fact that the capital raised has been utilized to enhance AI revenues in a way that has boosted growth by triple digits, shows it has been a positive strategic move. Furthermore, AI has not only helped the company diversify its business, but also contributed to making it less vulnerable to cryptocurrency volatility. This is further evidenced when comparing how its revenues have evolved after the Bitcoin halving period with much larger peers Marathon Digital Holdings ( MARA ) and RIOT Platforms ( RIOT ) as shown below. Data by YCharts Thus, diversification into HPC has not only helped Bit Digital attain a superior revenue growth of 80% during the last year but also helped to stabilize the net income, especially in a period where miners are negatively impacted both by lower rewards and higher costs due to inflation remaining above the Fed's target of 2% and interest rate at 4.83% . Extending the comparison to two Bitcoin miners have adopted a similar diversification strategy by integrating HPC into their business models, the chart below shows that Bit Digital has delivered better revenue growth than Core Scientific ( CORZ ) and Hut 8 Mining ( HUT ). Data by YCharts This means it deserves better. Valuations and Risks Now, the company trailing price-to-sales of 5.28x exceeds the median for the IT sector by 66.47% which may lead us to believe it is overvalued. However, as shown below , a more precise comparison with industry specific peers which have also diversified into AI infrastructure tends to show otherwise. Thus, averaging the trailing P/S of the three stocks gives 7.5x which exceeds Bit Digital's by 29.65% which is abnormal given the way it has been expanding revenues through AI. Thus, adjusting accordingly, I have a target of $5.56 (4.29 x 1.2965), based on the current share price of $4.29. Comparison with peers (seekingalpha.com) This about 30% upside remains below Wall Street's average of 43% but is justified by the following risks. First, a large part of the recent upside in the value of Bitcoin has been tied to the speculative optimism around President-Elect Trump pro-Bitcoin stance, notably transforming the U.S into a major crypto hub . Thus, there are expectations that his reelection will augur well when it come to reducing regulatory constraints. However, as evidenced by Marathon and RIOT revenues dipping after the halving and as I had elaborated in previous thesis , miners are still adjusting to the post halving landscape, while having to devote more effort to maintaining the profitability of mining operations. Of course, asset prices are currently up, but, these will have to stay up sustainably in order to make a meaningful impact on profits. This is the only way to motivate miners to HODL coins in contrast to disposing their production on the market thereby increasing supply and pressurizing asset prices. Moreover, it is important to have clarity on the forthcoming Republican administration's stance on digital assets, and, any news update which falls short of market expectations may have a drastic effect on Bitcoin’s price, especially since Bit Digital has not shifted away from mining, but merely diversified into AI. Extrapolating further, given the strategy to fund growth mainly through equity offerings and until AI revenues are significant enough, Bitcoin-led volatility can cause the share price to drop to such an extent of offsetting the cost of dilution from new equity. In this connection, as AI infrastructure is integrated deeper into its operations, the miner will need additional financing, and this is where it becomes important to watch out for Q3 earnings call to gain further insights into its progress. What to look for in Q3 Now, the company is expected to generate $22.91 million or a 98.17% YoY growth in the third quarter of 2024. Noteworthily, it has beaten consensus estimates four times during the last four quarters. Also, Q2’s actual sales exceeded consensus estimates by 8.7%, a feat made possible due to the average BTC prices remaining at $65.8K and consistent AI revenues since it was the first full quarter operations of the HPC business. seekingalpha.com This implies that during Q3, the AI revenue stream will become more ""normalized"" accompanied by relatively lower BTC prices compared to Q2. Additionally, the previously announced incremental 2,000 H100 GPUs with the anchor tenant whose revenue generation was to start in the late Q3 will no longer happen as they are reviewing their hardware portfolio, possibly to fit in newer NVIDIA's H200 GPUs. Therefore, it appears less likely for Q3's 98% expected revenue growth, which by the way is lower than Q2's 220%, to be beaten in the same way as previously. Still, as part of its collaboration with European cloud gaming company Boosteroid involving GPU rental, annualized revenues of $2 million to $3 million are expected to start flowing in 2024 and extend into 2025. Here, we are talking about $700 million of sales over five years. Therefore, depending on the execution, the ingredients to increase revenue projections for FY-24 which currently stand at $112 million , or 149% YoY growth are present as Bit Digital diversifies beyond crypto and AI to gaming. Another important metric to watch out for is EPS, which is expected to break even in the first quarter of 2025 as shown below. Now, this could receive an acceleration as HPC sales which are typically meant to satisfy high-demand AI applications as part of stable service contracts makes up for a greater portion of the revenue mix. This is also less sensitive to the price swings inherent to cryptocurrencies. www.seekingalpha.com In conclusion, Bit Digital is well on track to deliver on its AI infrastructure strategy with 43% of revenues already derived from HPC in Q2, or barely six months after diversifying into the new income stream. Additionally, the rapid scaling of this segment was timely enough to offset the revenue short fall from Bitcoin halving, as a comparison with other miners has shown. In the same vein, its capital allocation strategy utilizing a combination of cash reserves, digital asset sales, equity issuance, and sales-lease back agreement (financing tied to equipment) has kept debt very low. At the same time, revenue growing at a rapid pace has imparted momentum to the stock, offsetting the cost of dilution from new equity. Finally, despite some potential short-term stock price pressure relating to Bitcoin, its strategic pivot to enhance long-term growth involving Bitcoin mining and AI infrastructure without forgetting gaming, positions it for further upside.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4736456-bit-digital-ai-plus-rising-bitcoin-prices-q3-preview?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36191620.jpeg

The dollar-denominated revenue also rose by 10% QoQ to $1.6 million, making the third quarter of 2024 the second-highest quarter for revenue in USD, just shy of its all-time high. Hedera’s Consensus Service was a significant contributor, with revenue increasing by 94% QoQ, accounting for 89% of the network’s total revenue. Total Value Locked In HBAR Rises 9% Staking activity also remained robust, with 22.3 billion HBAR staked, representing 59% of the circulating supply. This high staking percentage is attributed to entities like Hashgraph that actively participate in network consensus while forgoing staking rewards. However, both daily average new accounts and active accounts saw declines of 22% and 23%, respectively, indicating a potential slowdown in user acquisition. On the operational front, daily average contracts increased by 24%, driven by spikes throughout September. In the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, while total value locked (TVL) in USD dropped 18% QoQ, the TVL in HBAR rose 9%, suggesting that the decline in USD value was primarily due to HBAR’s price depreciation rather than capital outflows. As the network prepares for Q4, Messari forecasts an increase in circulating supply by approximately 287 million HBAR, primarily aimed at fostering ecosystem development and supporting open-source projects. HBAR Price Outlook HBAR, currently trading at $0.069, has shown relatively flat price action as it enters the fourth quarter, especially when compared to major digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Over the past week, Bitcoin has gained 24%, while Ethereum has surged by 31%. In contrast, HBAR has seen a more modest increase of 17%. Despite this recent uptick, HBAR remains 90% below its all-time high of $0.5692 reached in September 2021. This stark contrast becomes more pronounced as Bitcoin achieves new all-time highs for four consecutive days and Ethereum approaches its peak. Related Reading: Ethereum Could Be Set To Explore New Highs As On-Chain Metrics Light Up Looking forward, HBAR faces three critical resistance levels that could hinder its upward momentum as the broader market appears ready to push higher. Having recently broken out of a consolidation phase between $0.047 and $0.062, HBAR’s first major resistance is at $0.078, a level that has acted as a barrier for the past four months. Should the Hedera token overcome this initial hurdle, it will then encounter additional resistance at $0.092 and $0.118, corresponding to the six-month and eight-month resistance levels, respectively. If HBAR can maintain its upward trajectory and break through these key resistance points, it may inch closer to its previous all-time highs, especially if the gains seen in key metrics in Q3 continue and translate into further price action.

42435383,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kpAhu,1731436785,"El Salvador's Bitcoin Stash Rises Above $500M, but Bhutan Story Might Be Even Bigger","The value of El Salvador's bitcoin holdings have risen above $500 million and Bhutan's above $1 billion.  Bhutan's BTC holdings now account for more than one-third of its GDP versus El Salvador's stack at just 1.5% of its GDP.  The fiscal situation of El Salvador's government continues to improve.  Bitcoin’s face-ripping rally on Monday pushed the value of El Salvador's BTC above $500 million and the tiny Kingdom of Bhutan's holdings above $1 billion.  Data from El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office shows the country's bitcoin stack at just less than 5,932 tokens. With the price at $87,000 at press time, that's worth roughly $516 million.  Impressive as El Salvador President Nayib Bukele's Bitcoin bet might be, the Kingdom of Bhutan's story might be even better.  The tiny South Asian state, with a population of just 800,000 (vs. El Salvador at 6.4 million), is sitting on a bitcoin stash of 12,574 tokens, per Arkham Intelligence, worth $1.1 billion at the current price.  Put another way, the value of Bhutan's bitcoin holdings amounts to more than one-third of the country's GDP of just under $3 billion. El Salvador's $500 million in bitcoin amounts to just 1.5% of its GDP.  Bhutan’s holdings have reportedly been accumulated through bitcoin mining, as the Himalayan nation has an abundance of hydroelectric power. The country, in September, was reported by Arkham to likely to be the fourth biggest nation-state bitcoin holder.  After purchasing bitcoin on a few occasions during the 2021 bull run, El Salvador began dollar-cost-averaging into the top cryptocurrency in November 2022, and was in the black on its holdings by December 2023, according to Bukele. El Salvador's bitcoin strategy has been a constant sticking point with the International Monetary Fund, which has raised concerns about the nation's fiscal situation.  But that situation apparently continues to improve. The country today said that it intends to buy back $2.5 billion of its dollar-denominated debt. According to Bloomberg, El Salvador's debt has returned 4.7% since the election of Donald Trump last week.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING | ARKM,Tom Carreras,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/12/el-salvadors-bitcoin-stash-rises-above-500m-but-bhutan-story-might-be-even-bigger,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e45359923799a19c2d522da1ea88ebace7e1d7a2-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The cryptocurrency industry spent around $135 million in the 2024 election cycle to back more than 50 candidates. If the United States establishes a Bitcoin strategic reserve, it will kick off a global FOMO unlike anything we have ever seen before. The U.S. already has a good start with 208,109 Bitcoin worth around $16 billion. It has been quite an amazing week for cryptocurrency investors. Monday marks the biggest day ever for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) in terms of the absolute dollar gain, at over $9,000. The Bitcoin price has surged 30% higher in just 7 days to $88,000! The #2 cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), is up 38% in the past week. Many of the smaller altcoins that we hold in the Nicoya Research Crypto Corner portfolio are up over 50% in the past week, with our top pick up over 75%! This puts most of our cryptocurrency positions at gains of 200% or more year-to-date in 2024. The election of Donald Trump has helped, as both he and his inner circle have been incredibly supportive of the cryptocurrency industry during the election cycle. It is estimated that around 75% of the pro-crypto candidates won last week. The cryptocurrency industry spent around $135 million in the 2024 election cycle to back more than 50 candidates. These candidates included both Democrats and Republicans. 53 out of 56 candidates backed by crypto’s PACs have been declared winners. Crypto made its biggest bet in Ohio, spending $40 million on Bernie Moreno. Moreno’s campaign was against Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown, who has been a vocal crypto critic. President Trump has promised to fire Gary Gensler, who has been a thorn in the side of the crypto industry for years. JD Vance reported that he holds at least $250k of crypto personally. But perhaps the most bullish political development for the cryptocurrency sector has been calls from Trump and other prominent politicians to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. In July, Trump pledged to form a Bitcoin Reserve, using 210,000 Bitcoin seized by the Department of Justice, as the core of a new “Strategic National Bitcoin Stockpile.” Senator Cynthia Lummis tweeted: We Are Going To Build A Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Her Bitcoin Strategic Reserve bill proposes the U.S. buys 1 million bitcoin over 5 years. That’s 547 bitcoin every day, or more than all new bitcoin currently mined daily (450). Lummis went on to say: A Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will allow the US to address a meaningful portion of our debt + strengthen our hand. See ‘Currency Wars’ for a good primer on the ‘stupid games, stupid prizes’ cycle we are in. Let’s break the cycle and refocus on a prosperous future for Americans. Just today on CNBC, Barbara Goldstein said that her investment group in very high on Bitcoin and believes it could become the next United States strategic reserve asset. Florida’s Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis is advocating for a strategic Bitcoin reserve, saying that BTC is “digital gold.” Tulsi Gabbard also commented that: “There is value in the U.S. having its own strategic Bitcoin reserve.” We now have approximately three months until the U.S. Government puts into law active accumulation of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. Other sovereign nations are certainly discreetly front running the United States. The clock has already started ticking and in 2025, I expect that multiple states will have Strategic Bitcoin Reserve legislation introduced. German parliament member Joana Cotar commented this week: “If the U.S. starts a strategic Bitcoin reserve, expect a serious case of FOMO (fear of missing out) across Europe.” Dennis Porter, CEO & Co-Founder of Satoshi Act Fund, and President & Founder of Satoshi Educate, claims that the momentum is already building, after having calls with nation states that are already moving rapidly to acquire Bitcoin. It’s all happening much faster than expected and the momentum is incredible. History is currently being made. If the United States establishes a Bitcoin strategic reserve, it will kick off a global FOMO unlike anything we have ever seen before. And this will be global, with China Central TV reporting this week that “Trump has promised to make the US the world’s Bitcoin and crypto capital and establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve.” It is logical to conclude that China will continue in the race to accumulate Bitcoin and may accelerate purchases to catch up to the United States soon. The U.S. already has a good start with 208,109 Bitcoin worth around $16 billion. Only China is close with 190,000 BTC ($14.5B worth). The UK is a distant third place at around 61,000 Bitcoin or $4.7 billion worth. USA: $15.9B (Largest Holder)China: $14.5BUK: $4.67BUkraine: $3.53BBhutan: $957MEl Salvador: $452MVenezuela: $18.32MFinland: $6.87M Germany, however, made headlines for selling its seized Bitcoin too early, missing out on over $1.4B in potential profits in just a few months. Germany sold 50,000 BTC at $54,000 each, now worth $88,000 each. Bitcoin ETFs have undoubtedly been a hit since launching earlier this year. That momentum has continued, with Blackrock’s Bitcoin ETF officially surpassing its Gold ETF in terms of the dollar value of the assets each ETF holds. In other words, the Blackrock Bitcoin ETF holds more Bitcoin (in dollar terms) than the Blackrock Gold ETF. The inflows to this Bitcoin ETF have reached $33.2 billion in just 10 months! While Bitcoin is currently worth $1.7 trillion, the price still needs to more than double just to reach the market cap of Nvidia and needs to go up around 10x to reach the market cap of gold.

Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) are best known for building a Bitcoin Treasury. As of Nov. 10, the company held a total of 279,420 bitcoins, which were acquired at an aggregate price of ~$11.,9B and an average purchase price of $42,692 per bitcoin. This strategy has worked well for Microstrategy and their investors, as the share price is up 537% in the past year alone! Other public companies are starting to follow the Microstrategy playbook, with Semler Scientific, Inc. ( SMLR ) purchasing $57 million for its balance sheet this year. The company is benefiting, with the SMLR share price up 101% in the past month alone! Other top public companies holding Bitcoin include Galaxy Digital Holdings ( BRPHF ), MARA Holdings ( MARA ), Tesla ( TSLA ), Coinbase ( COIN ), and Block ( SQ ). This chart below is current as of November, but does not include Saylor’s latest Bitcoin purchases for MSTR. One signal that the current rally is being driven by smart money, sovereign nations, corporations and not retail, is the following chart of Google search trends for “bitcoin.” Mainstream investors are not searching for Bitcoin and looking at how to invest. New investors are not driving this price advance, which tells me we are likely in the early innings. Retail traders typically join late and push prices to blow-off tops. They will have their own FOMO and we will see retail increasingly joining the party in the weeks and months ahead, pushing the Bitcoin price even higher. The Bitcoin ETFs also only bought $340 million today, much lower than recent days. For this number not to be higher on the largest dollar gain in Bitcoin’s history, suggests someone else very large is moving the market and not retail. If you have been following our research, you will know that we first suggested Bitcoin to our subscribers around $100, added Bitcoin to the Nicoya Research portfolio under $1,000 and have recommended buying monthly ever since. We were accumulating during the dip of 2022/2023 and continue to dollar cost average with regular purchases. This is a long-term play, and we continue to believe it is the best investment of our generation. We also hold a principled view that Bitcoin is not only good for our financial portfolios, but good for humanity at large. The return to a form of scarce, free market money that is not controlled by a small group of bankers or politicians provides a level playing field and opportunity for anyone to prosper. Many investors have stood on the sideline and watched. They are too scared to buy on the dips and then fear they missed the boat on the rallies. They are now wanting to get in, but are worried it may be too late. My outlook remains incredibly bullish. Governments that can create their own currencies have an unlimited amount available to start building their strategic Bitcoin reserves. With Trump announcing his support, winning the election and then a Senator introducing a bill to acquire 1 million Bitcoin for the United States, you can be sure that multiple nations are trying to front run the U.S. and acquire Bitcoin at lower prices. This could turn into an all-out race and push the Bitcoin price exponentially higher. We are literally going to see infinite balance sheets pouring into absolute and immutable scarcity. Literally ∞/21M. And this is happening 6 months after the latest halving, which is typically when we see the greatest price gains of each cycle as the lower supply output works through markets. So, while you can expect plenty of volatility, the trend is going to be firmly to the upside and this bull cycle in Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency sector still has plenty of upside ahead in my view. I think investors will do well to just buy and hold Bitcoin. I advocate for self-custody using a hardware wallet, but everyone will have to decide which method of ownership/custody is best for them. Those that can make regular purchases and stack over time, increasing buys on dips, are likely to do even better. At Nicoya Research, we also hold several smaller-cap cryptocurrencies that have outperformed Bitcoin, as well as a few crypto stocks that are generating leveraged returns for our portfolio. I also share strategies to further increase returns via staking and utilizing decentralized finance platforms.

36189633,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652701,1731434438,Dogecoin Unleashes 157% Weekly Boom As Musk-Trump Buzz Builds,"Dogecoin (DOGE) is making news again, as analysts forecast a price increase. Following Trump’s recent election victory, the cryptocurrency has enjoyed a phenomenal 157% weekly increase, fuelled by increased speculation about the roles of Elon Musk and Trump in the incoming administration. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Data Signals Big Moves Ahead As Stakeholder Activity Spikes Dogecoin On A Tear A number of cryptocurrencies, including Dogecoin, have experienced significant price gains as a result of Bitcoin’s recent rise to more than $88,000,000. This recently discovered interest in the cryptocurrency that was inspired by memes has given rise to conjecture regarding its future as well as price projections for the months or years to come regarding its value. DOGE price registers a solid 150% in the last week. Source: Bitstamp Price Forecast For 2024 There is a wide range of forecasts regarding the value of Dogecoin for this year by various analysts. The conservative estimate ranges between $0.078 and $0.106, while the optimistic one goes to $0.45. Based on analysis, its value is anticipated to be $0.1194 and $0.1443 for the year. Again, the fluctuations are induced by market sentiments and other external causes. It’s interesting to note that the link between Dogecoin and Bitcoin is still strong, with a score of 0.92. What this means is that DOGE tends to go up or down with Bitcoin. According to analysts, this connection could be a double-edged sword. If Bitcoin goes down, Dogecoin might not be safe. Market Sentiment And Investor Interest The current market sentiment for Dogecoin is bullish, with a Fear & Greed Index score of 69, reflecting investor greed. DOGE has spent 19 of the last 30 days in the green, demonstrating its current rising trend. Dogecoin is also gaining popularity among retail investors, who are driven to the cryptocurrency field by its meme culture and community support. Meanwhile, according to an analyst, traders should expect massive upward swings followed by large pullbacks, continuing into 2025. A significant increase in volume should also drive the price higher. $DOGE $10+ DOGECOIN?!🚀🚀 Anyone who has followed me for a while knows that the Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern is my favorite trading setup of my trading career.

While Dogecoin is expected to make significant gains, it may also see corrections along the road. One projection predicts a 12% reduction by December 2024. Related Reading: Bitcoin Closing In On $80,000 For Record-Breaking Run After Trump Win The Broader Crypto Landscape The broader cryptocurrency market is recovering, which began in 2023, owing primarily to Bitcoin’s revival. As Bitcoin continues to reach new highs, altcoins like Dogecoin frequently profit from the enthusiasm. However, experts advise that investors trying to diversify their portfolios should not rely solely on Bitcoin’s performance. Although Dogecoin is likely to appreciate in value significantly in 2024 and afterward — especially since the coin has recently gone up by 150% — investors should be careful because the market for cryptocurrencies is volatile. It is believed that the relationship between Bitcoin and Dogecoin will remain a factor on DOGE’s movement over the next few months. As usual, potential investors should do their own homework and examine market conditions before investing any funds.

High management fees and significant tracking errors undermine GBTC's value proposition, making it less efficient for Bitcoin exposure. Competing Bitcoin ETFs, like those from BlackRock, offer similar exposure at a fraction of GBTC's cost, making them more attractive to investors. While bullish on Bitcoin, I don't think investors should be holding GBTC unless management significantly reduces fees to improve cost efficiency and net returns. Investment Thesis Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ETF (GBTC)’s discount to Net Asset Value ((NAV)) has been a solid entry point for investors that wanted to get Bitcoin exposure without the complex logistics of directly holding the cryptocurrency. The discount, which was a result of GBTC’s previous closed-end structure, allowed investors to benefit as the fund converged on its NAV. GBTC’s shares often traded below their NAV. Earlier this year, GBTC converted from a closed-end fund to an open-end vehicle. This dissipated much of this NAV discount and narrowed the trading price’s difference between the value of the underlying Bitcoin holdings and the trading price. With the discount now gone, holding GBTC will depend on Bitcoin’s market performance and the fees of the underlying ETF. While there’s a bullish outlook on Bitcoin after the 2024 presidential election here in the US, there are cheaper ETF options that minimize the fees from owning the cryptocurrency through a custodian. Newer Bitcoin ETFs are now seen as strong alternatives, given their lower fees compared to GBTC. Given that there’s no discount-based advantage, and in light of its relatively high fees, I am downgrading my view on GBTC from a buy to hold. I don’t believe Bitcoin’s rally will slow anytime soon, but I believe GBTC no longer offers the most efficient vehicle for Bitcoin exposure. Investors are likely better off with lower-cost ETFs, which offer similar Bitcoin exposure without the premium fee structure. Why I'm Doing Follow-Up Coverage In my last article from May , I thought GBTC was a buy based on their rising AUM because the NAV discount has disappeared. With the recent structural changes at GBTC in the spring, the trust’s conversion to an open-ended fund has resulted in the NAV discount disappearing. While the adjustment has boosted liquidity and tax efficiency, it has simultaneously removed the discount-based incentive, and now has also removed some of the catchup demand which was the foundation of my previous buy. Bitcoin ETFs are competitive and this has also put pressure on GBTC’s fee structure. GBTC’s fees remain higher relative to other funds, and this will reduce returns over time unless something changes. With other Bitcoin ETFs (like BlackRock’s (IBIT)) now offering similar exposure with much lower fees, GBTC no longer makes sense. The purpose of this follow-up analysis is to show how GBTC’s market performance has shifted. There are now much more efficient alternatives available to investors who want Bitcoin exposure at lower costs in their traditional brokerage accounts​. How GBTC Has Gotten Comparatively Worse Following former President Trump's win last week, Bitcoin’s price has surged to a record high of $88,000 as of the time of this writing, driving strong gains across Bitcoin-related ETFs. GBTC in particular is up 38.34% since the last time I wrote about it in May. The Trump administration is expected to create a highly favorable environment for cryptocurrencies here in the US, through supportive legislation and regulations. We’re really looking at accelerated institutional adoption in my opinion. Despite the strong performance in GBTC and the overall market optimism in Bitcoin, I actually believe the ETF has still lost much of its appeal, especially compared to newer Bitcoin ETFs that offer similar exposure at lower fees. GBTC's high management fee clocks in at 1.5% per year. This is a huge disadvantage. When we look at other Bitcoin ETFs, such as those introduced by major players like BlackRock annual fee structures typically come in below 0.25% per annum . Compared to GBTC, this means we can get Bitcoin exposure in a brokerage account at a fraction of the cost (less than 1/5th of the cost)​. GBTC’s Bitcoin Mini Trust which targets retail investors also comes with a lower sponsor’s fee of 0.15% , which shows why GBTC’s fee structure is problematic. The trust’s Bitcoin assets are also held by Coinbase Custody Trust Company to simplify the custody for investors who may not want to manage a digital wallet. The same product for lower fees? I am not sure how they plan to help their main fund win. After the trust’s launch in July, I just don’t understand what GBTC’s unique appeal is. The investment product has really fallen behind in terms of cost-effectiveness​. Valuation GBTC’s high expense ratio and historical tracking error are a huge valuation challenge for investors who want to be long run involved with this fund. At the heart of this is the expense ratio of 1.50% per year that I mentioned before. This is clearly high for a fund whose goal is to track a single asset – Bitcoin. The fee structure is currently rated by Seeking Alpha at an F. Ouch. Keep in mind that the overall median expense ratio for ETFs is at only 0.49%, meaning this is a 206.12% premium investors are paying as a management fee on GBTC. Because the ETF tracks one core asset, high expenses are going to inevitably continue to reduce returns, particularly over the long term, really putting GBTC at a disadvantage relative to competing funds. The tracking error in GBTC further complicates their valuation appeal. Over a one-year period, GBTC has booked a tracking error of 56.58% , way higher than the 7.60% median for other ETFs, or a 644.96% difference. This is a huge deviation from Bitcoin’s actual performance​. While some of this was the convergence to NAV as the fund restructured, this is still notable. Putting it together, I think a fund whose entire mandate is to mirror Bitcoin, this level of tracking error is alarming. The primary function of a single-asset fund is to provide direct exposure with minimal deviation, but GBTC’s metrics suggest alarming inefficiencies in achieving this goal. Given these structural issues, I think it is difficult to estimate the true value of GBTC. While high fees and tracking errors might be manageable in a multi-asset ETF with active management, they are hard to justify in a passively managed, single-asset trust. I believe the market has already shown (and will show again) a tendency to penalize such inefficiencies with a persistent NAV discount, which could resurface for GBTC if these problems remain unaddressed. With competing ETFs available at lower fees and with likely more consistent tracking, GBTC’s premium appears unsustainable. Bull Thesis Really, the biggest bull thesis is the prospect of GBTC slashing their management fees to something closer to the sector median. A fee reduction or, even more impactful, a complete elimination of management fees would increase the net returns for investors. I think this could alter the market’s perception of GBTC’s value. Removing fees would directly address one of GBTC’s primary drawbacks. If management fees were eliminated, GBTC could leverage their established brand to help regain appeal among institutional investors who prioritize cost-efficiency in crypto investments. This fee reduction is important in a single-asset fund like GBTC, where investors expect minimal costs for merely tracking a core asset. While investors themselves would not benefit from a rise in AUM for the ETF if it consolidated its fee structure, ETF holders would benefit from stronger long-run returns. Fees would be lower, individual returns would be inevitably higher. I don’t have any reason to refute this bull thesis. To be frank, if GBTC cut its fees down to 25 or 30 bps I could see myself upgrading this fund up to a strong buy. But what matters most is that investors pay lower fees to invest. We’re not yet seeing that. Takeaway GBTC once offered stock market investors a unique, valuable entry into Bitcoin through a publicly traded vehicle, often resulting in a NAV discount. However, with the NAV discount gone and competition rising from lower-cost Bitcoin ETFs, GBTC’s appeal has fallen off. High management fees remain the core issue, and tracking errors further impacts my valuation confidence. While I remain bullish on Bitcoin’s future, GBTC no longer provides the most efficient exposure to the asset. With this, other Bitcoin ETFs like the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ), which I recently covered, offer more cost-effective options. These funds provide similar exposure without the significant fee burden attached to GBTC and make them more attractive to cost-sensitive investors. As a result, I, personally, have shifted my belief in GBTC from a buy to a hold. Despite Bitcoin’s bullish outlook, I believe there are more efficient funds for investors to capture this growth with. GBTC’s high fees undermine their value proposition. As the market for Bitcoin ETFs grows, investors are likely to favor funds that balance exposure with minimal costs, which GBTC’s structure currently fails to achieve. For now, I am a hold on to shares. If management were to slash the fee structure, however, I would be interested in taking another look at the fund.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4736384-gbtc-dont-play-bitcoin-with-this-etf-rating-downgrade?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36186935.jpeg

StarkWare, the main developer firm behind Starknet, had shared in July that it would introduce a proposal for staking on the blockchain, but had not previously fixed the date of the rollout.  According to the team, anyone will be able to participate in staking on the blockchain. Validators will require a minimum of 20,000 STRK tokens ($9,610) to operate their nodes. Delegators must hold STRK tokens and will be able to choose a validator to delegate their stakes to.  The team also shared on X that “validators and delegators will be subject to a 21-day unstaking lockup period.”  StarkWare has recently moved away from solely focusing on the Ethereum layer-2 landscape, and has pivoted more of its research and development efforts to the Bitcoin ecosystem.  Last week, the StarkWare team, alongside some top Bitcoin developers, made some breakthroughs on new features that could make Bitcoin more programmable.

This decline comes amid a period of recovery and positive momentum for the SHIB price, raising questions about whether the meme coin can still achieve its 2021 All-Time High of $0.00008. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Plummets In the last 24 hours, Shiba Inu’s burn rate has crashed by 82.32%. The Shibburn wallet tracker has reported this significant drop, revealing that only 81,937,558 SHIB tokens have been sent to dead blockchain wallets. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price To $1 Soon? Textbook Weekly Golden Cross Shows What’s Coming Next This severe decrease in burn activity contrasts significantly with previous periods when millions of Shiba Inu tokens were burned daily. Shiba Inu achieved a historic feat not too long ago, burning $100,000 worth of SHIB tokens in one transaction. The SHIB burn mechanism is a procedure that involves sending a portion of tokens to an inaccessible or “dead” wallet to reduce supply, increase scarcity, and potentially trigger a bullish surge in the price of the coin. These burns, recorded by Shibburn, a dedicated burn tracker for the Shiba Inu ecosystem, are primarily driven by the SHIB community. While the drop in Shiba Inu burn rate may be a challenge, this development comes at a surprising time. The SHIB price has been showing signs of recovery this week, bouncing back from previous lows. The Shiba Inu price has surged 16.28% in just one day and appears to be on a continued bullish momentum. Additionally, whale volume has seen a spike, suggesting that investors are accumulating SHIB tokens. Despite the recent price recovery and whale activity, Shiba Inu’s rise to $0.00008 could be compromised by its recent decline in burn rates. This decline appears to be severe, as SHIB has not recorded any notable burns over the past week. Shibburn reports that in the last 77 days, burn rates have been down 88%. For Shiba Inu to surge to its $0.00008 ATH, the cryptocurrency will need to be driven by several bullish factors and positive market sentiment. A combination of heightened market demand, increased burn rates, and strong momentum could catalyze Shiba Inu to its ATH milestone. However, with the burn rate currently down, SHIB’s ongoing growth trajectory to a new ATH is now in question.

Artificial intelligence company Genius Group (GNS) has adopted bitcoin {{BTC}} as its primary treasury asset, committing 90% of its current and future reserves to be held in bitcoin, according to a press release.  Shares in the Singapore-based company rose as much as 50% in premarket trading before giving up much of the move. They remain 10% higher than Monday's close, at $0.70 per share.  The company said it plans to acquire an initial $120 million worth of bitcoin — about 1,380 BTC at current prices — that will be held for the long term. It will also enable bitcoin payments for its Edtech platform. The decision follows a restructuring of the company's board to include several people with backgrounds in crypto and Web3 technologies.  Genius follows a path set by Michael Saylor-led software developer MicroStrategy, which now holds 279,420 BTC ($24 billion) after adopting a strategy of acquiring bitcoin in 2020 as a hedge against inflation. In May, medical device maker Semler Scientific said it planned to do the same, and now holds more than 1,000 bitcoin. Its decision came days after Tokyo-based Metaplanet, an investment adviser, joined the movement. It also now has just over 1,000 BTC.

Bitcoin's remarkable surge this week has continued, with the cryptocurrency currently trading around $86,000. This follows a significant breakthrough last Tuesday when Bitcoin overcame resistance at $68,000 amid the U.S. election results. With Donald Trump set to assume the presidency, Bitcoin’s price began to rise rapidly.The rally intensified during the early hours of the Asian trading session, propelling Bitcoin to an intraday high of $89,964. However, this peak sparked a bearish reaction, with sellers stepping in to prevent the cryptocurrency from maintaining levels above this milestone. At the time of reporting, Bitcoin had gone down to $86,386.10, though it still reflects a 5.30% gain over the past 24 hours and an impressive 25.69% increase over the past week.Warning for Further RetracementMichaël van de Poppe, the founder of MNConsultancy, observed that the market is gaining momentum but anticipates a retracement leading up to the release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data on November 13. He identified a ""sweet spot"" for entries, suggesting a 10% correction toward the CME gap before continuation. https://TWITTER.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1856256610466705567Van de Poppe's target range for this retracement lies between the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $75,669.64 and the 61.8% level at $81,193.13.He also highlighted $66,729 as an ""ideal area to hold"" and pointed to $64,130.63 as a potential level where liquidity could be taken out, signaling areas where market participants might seek to fill orders before prices move higher.Overbought ConditionsTechnical indicators further suggest that Bitcoin may be entering overbought territory. The crypto trades above the upper Bollinger Band, typically indicating that the asset may be overbought or due for a consolidation or correction phase. Bitcoin 1-day Chart Furthermore, the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 75.20, surpassing the standard overbought threshold of 70. This suggests that Bitcoin could face downward pressure or a correction in the short term.Rising Retail InterestMeanwhile, technical analyst Ali Martinez has advised investors to exercise caution amid surging retail interest in Bitcoin. He noted that while growing retail interest often signals increased capital inflow into the market, historical data shows that heightened search activity for Bitcoin often aligns with price corrections. This pattern suggests that Bitcoin's price tends to decline when its search activity increases, warranting vigilance among investors.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/12/bitcoin-drops-to-86000-as-expert-warns-of-10-dip-ahead-of-cpi-data/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitcoin-drops-to-86000-as-expert-warns-of-10-dip-ahead-of-cpi-data,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

My bull case assumes a 25% chance of Bitcoin matching gold’s market cap, reaching $750,000 per coin, based on the possibility of U.S. adoption as a reserve asset. I retain a $50,000 bear case, using the average Bitcoin Realized Price as a baseline, envisioning a scenario where Bitcoin serves mainly as a trading asset rather than a reserve. I believe a Trump administration may positively influence Bitcoin through favorable regulations and tax policies, potentially spurring other nations to consider Bitcoin as a reserve asset. With Bitcoin currently trading below my new expected range, I rate it as a Strong Buy, seeing it as a high-risk, high-reward asymmetric bet with long-term potential. Back in May, I wrote about how I see Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) as an asymmetric bet on its adoption as a global reserve asset, with an expected value between $40,000 to $100,000 per Bitcoin. Since then, I believe Trump’s recent election victory and Bitcoin’s rise to new all-time highs have significantly altered the investment case for Bitcoin. This is why, in this article, I’ll update my model for evaluating Bitcoin under the Trump administration, resulting in a new expected value range for the Bitcoin asymmetric bet: $112,500 to $200,000 per coin. Recap: My model for assessing Bitcoin’s expected value as an asymmetric bet I encourage readers to review my previous articles on Bitcoin as well as my most recent piece, where I discuss why I believe Bitcoin is maturing as a global reserve asset and not a new global currency. For those not inclined to do so, this section provides a quick summary of my key points and previous model for assessing Bitcoin’s expected value as an asymmetric bet. I see Bitcoin as having all the technical characteristics needed to become a superior global reserve asset: durability, divisibility, fungibility, portability, verifiability, and scarcity. With that in mind, I believe Bitcoin at current levels represents an asymmetric bet on the possibility it actually gets adopted on a global scale as a reserve asset, partially replacing and complementing gold as well as other assets such as fiat currencies held by major nations as reserves. To understand the expected value of this asymmetric bet, my model assumes two cases (a bull and bear case) and three scenarios (which reflect different % probabilities that the bull and bear case play out). In my previous model, I based my evaluation on the following assumptions: A bull case where Bitcoin matches gold’s market capitalization, reaching a price of $650,000 per coin. Three probability scenarios: a 5%, 20%, and 25% chance of my bull case materializing. In the next section, I will outline how and why I am revising my bull case and probability scenarios. My new bull case: A 25% chance of Bitcoin matching gold in market cap In light of Donald Trump winning the US election, I am updating the three probability scenarios of my bull case for Bitcoin materializing. My base scenario is now a 25% chance that Bitcoin matures into a global reserve asset, matching gold in market capitalization. The reason why I am choosing this specific number has to do with Donald Trump suggesting that the US under his administration might buy and/or mine Bitcoin to create a national reserve. Polymarket, a crypto-based betting platform that recently correctly predicted Trump winning the US election, currently puts at 25% the chance that Trump will create a national Bitcoin reserve. My assumption here is that if the US does start the creation of a national Bitcoin reserve, this will trigger other nation states and major institutional investors to do the same, having Bitcoin rapidly maturing into an asset class of roughly the same size as gold. My other two scenarios assign a probability of 35% and 50% respectively of this happening. These numbers are purely for reference, and as I outlined in my first article, readers can play with the assumptions according to their own beliefs to understand what this asymmetric bet could pay out for them. Expected Values of Bear & Bullish cases for BTC (Author's own work) Worth noting is that since my last article, gold ran to new all-time highs. I have reflected this change in my bullish target price - which went from $650,000 to $750,000 per Bitcoin. The overall result of my updated model is that the expected outcome of the Bitcoin asymmetric bet is between $112,500 and $200,000 per coin. Given Bitcoin’s price expressed in USD is at around $87,000 at the time of writing, I assign a STRONG BUY to Bitcoin. Quick note on why I am not updating my Bitcoin Bear case In my bear case, I see Bitcoin stabilizing around the average of the Short Term ( increased since my first article, I am keeping my bear case unchanged at $50,000. I’m using the average Bitcoin Realized Price as a bear case benchmark because, in my view, it reflects the average price people pay for their Bitcoin. In a bear scenario, I envision Bitcoin remaining more of an “online casino,” where users trade it primarily for short- to mid-term gains. In such a case, I expect Bitcoin holders, akin to gamblers, would generally avoid selling at a loss, anchoring the price around this level. Beyond the theory: How I see a Trump admin playing out for Bitcoin I see the model I just went through purely as a theoretical exercise that can help investors decide whether it makes sense to enter Bitcoin at current price levels. Beyond this model, I believe a Trump administration would be overall very favorable for Bitcoin in terms of regulations and a more lax approach to taxation. Gary Gensler, the current SEC chairman, is rumored to be leaving before year-end. Historically critical of cryptocurrencies, Gensler is widely viewed within the crypto community as a barrier to broader institutional adoption. I believe the U.S. has an unparalleled ability to drive technological innovation, political influence, and economic policy globally—perhaps only rivaled by China in certain areas. If the U.S. adopts an open stance toward cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin, I think it could prompt other governments to begin seriously considering Bitcoin as a reserve asset. In this regard, I see game theory playing a major role for Bitcoin. Once a few major institutions or national governments begin to see value in Bitcoin, others may feel compelled to follow to avoid the risk of being left out. Currently, a few governments, like El Salvador, hold Bitcoin as a reserve, but they are relatively small players. For game theory to truly take effect and drive Bitcoin’s maturation, I think it would require adoption from at least a couple of the top 20 economies by GDP. Whether and when the U.S. will be among these adopters remains to be seen. As usual, I avoid providing an exact time frame for any of my asymmetric bets to play out. I encourage readers interested in this opportunity to conduct further research, challenge their own assumptions, and, if convinced, hold with a multi-year, long-term perspective. Risks to my thesis The main limitation of my model lies in its assumptions, which are ultimately subjective. I’ve assigned a 24% probability that Bitcoin becomes a U.S. reserve asset, potentially setting the stage for it to mature as a global reserve asset. This estimate is based on forecasts from Polymarket, a crypto-betting platform that accurately predicted Trump’s victory. However, readers may reasonably disagree with this probability, and some might see the chance of Bitcoin evolving into a global reserve asset as far less likely. For this reason, I encourage readers to ""play"" with the model, adjusting the assumptions according to their own taste to assess whether Bitcoin is worth the risk at its current price. While I see promising growth and adoption potential for Bitcoin, it remains a historically volatile asset and an asymmetric bet—by nature, a high-risk play. Conclusion I believe a Trump administration that is openly considering Bitcoin as a U.S. reserve asset and supporting the technology will be a boost for Bitcoin’s global adoption, regardless of whether all promises are fully implemented once Trump takes office in January. This significant shift in U.S. policy is why I’m updating my Bitcoin valuation model. I now see Bitcoin as an asymmetric bet with an expected value range of $112,500 to $200,000 per coin. With Bitcoin trading at around $87,000 at the time of writing—still below the lower bound of my expected range—I recommend a strong buy , given the asymmetric nature of this bet.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4736345-updating-my-bitcoin-bull-case-for-a-trump-administration?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36183129.jpeg
42415542,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOJumI,1731425091,How We Can Make the Agentic Internet Work for Everyone,"The internet is on the brink of a profound shift. The vision of AI agents — intelligent digital assistants acting autonomously on behalf of individuals and organizations — is becoming a reality. This ""Agentic Internet"" will soon be populated by trillions of AI agents making decisions, executing tasks, and engaging in commerce without direct human supervision. However, this transformation brings significant challenges that we must address to ensure a secure, fair, and trustworthy digital ecosystem.  As personal AI agents take on complex roles, understanding and authenticating their identity becomes crucial. The concept of being personal implies that an agent may represent its creator to make significant decisions, from financial transactions to negotiations. A critical issue arises: how do we ensure that an agent truly represents its human creator?  This problem extends to the data used in the agent's development. If an AI agent leverages datasets or models not originating from or approved by its creator, the alignment between the agent and its creator may be compromised. This mismatch can create an identity crisis, undermining trust in these digital interactions.  Allowing an AI agent to have its own wallet or the rights to manage a user’s wallet is crucial for realizing the vision of fully autonomous AI agents. This capability can help bridge the digital divide, as agents are often better equipped than most human users to handle digital assets and complex smart contracts. Ensuring the security of these agents is paramount: how can we trust an AI agent to manage valuable digital assets?  The decentralized nature of digital assets demands heightened security measures. An even greater challenge arises as humans may have to navigate different digital interfaces used by AI agents, potentially increasing the risk of phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks. How can we ensure payments are made to the correct recipient? More intuitive identification and authentication methods based on human interactions are needed to minimize the digital divide. Yet, there is always a trade-off between security and usability.  Democratization of the Agentic Internet  Another pressing challenge is the potential for AI to deepen existing socioeconomic inequalities. Wealthier individuals and corporations are better positioned to invest in more sophisticated AI agents, capable of executing high-impact strategies and dominating digital markets. These advanced agents could widen the resource and opportunity gap, effectively amplifying the influence of the already privileged.  In contrast, individuals or communities with limited resources may find themselves further marginalized, lacking the advanced digital capabilities necessary to compete. In our vision of the agentic internet, users gain greater autonomy and control over their digital presence, guided by AI agents. We empower communities to thrive in a more decentralized, user-centric online environment. Users could transform their social capital and/or reputation capital into an economic capital in the agentic internet.  Also worth mentioning: as AI agents are extensions or manifestations of their creators in the digital realm, it becomes essential to contemplate their digital responsibilities, digital rights and autonomy.  Finding the Path for the Agentic Internet  On October 31, Bangdao Chen, Co-Founder of the Oxford Blockchain Research Centre, and Ramesh Ramadoss, Chair of the IEEE Blockchain Technical Community hosted an event titled “Smart Agents on an Enriched Blockchain” at Keble College, Oxford. It highlighted the challenges and design solutions in the agentic internet: building independent and verifiable agents. Renowned computer scientists, including Richard Sutton FRS FRSC, the ""father of reinforcement learning,"" and Bill Roscoe FREng, Director of the Oxford Blockchain Research Centre, along with other experts, presented at the event.  Granting AI agents autonomy and learning ability could enhance their trust in their interactions and help mitigate social imbalances. This can be achieved through an autonomous verification-based approach, where security, and governance are programmed as rules registered on a blockchain. Here are ways we could define a set of protocols for creating, training, and maintaining ""digital lives"":  Verification of AI Agents  AI agents could be verified using formal methods to identify their characteristics, akin to labeling bottled water with details about its mineral content, production date and origin. Formal verification can improve transparency and trust in AI agents by allowing users to know what the agent is, how it may behave, and what it can generate.  ID Generation with Governance in Mind  ID generation should consider AI governance and nature's laws. An agent cannot simply be filled with arbitrary code or data to represent a digital presence; it should evolve over time, mirroring the process of DNA evolving into a life form. Time could be treated as a unique factor in the agent's ID, enhancing diversity and promoting equal rights.  Secure Wallets for AI Agents  AI agents should have their own wallets, independent of human control. This autonomy brings multiple benefits: agents may be better suited to managing digital assets and resisting scams. Humans could delegate business operations to these agents, especially in digital realms.  But security remains a core challenge, requiring new payment protocols to support human-to-agent transactions, agent-to-agent transactions, and a multi-agent economy. Human-interactive security protocols could be developed to authenticate human-to-agent transactions.  Learning agents  AI agents that adaptively learn from their environment and interactions adjust their strategies based on feedback, making them highly responsive to changing conditions. Through methods like reinforcement learning, they explore and exploit various actions to optimize outcomes, adjusting in real-time to environmental shifts. These agents employ continuous learning to retain past knowledge while adapting to new information, enhancing their ability to handle dynamic environments without forgetting previous tasks.  Debates about AGI potentially taking over the world and making jobs redundant are widespread. However, by democratizing the power of AI through the Agentic Internet and creating robust frameworks for agent IDs and wallets, we can help address these perceptions and build a more inclusive digital economy.  Creating the path for the Agentic Internet within our digital civilization is no trivial task. This vision spans multiple research labs and is being developed piece by piece. We look forward to sharing our progress in the coming months as we work to make this ambitious vision a reality.

36182592,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=101254,1731424453,"Bitcoin Surges Past $89K with Thin Order Books, Signaling “Easy Up, Easy Down” Phase","As Bitcoin surged past $89,000 today, reaching new heights, the cryptocurrency market is witnessing warning signs of increased volatility. Notably, Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $89,956 today, marking the culmination of eight consecutive days of upward momentum, during which its value advanced by approximately 35%. This impressive rally has propelled Bitcoin to become the eighth most valuable asset in the world , surpassing silver.However, market watchers are expressing concern about the short-term outlook amid the ongoing upswing, warning of the potential for significant price corrections as well as further surges.Ki Young Ju, the founder of the analytics platform CryptoQuant, highlighted this dynamic in a post on X today.Bitcoin Seeing Thin Order Books, Signaling “Easy Up, Easy Down” PhaseYoung Ju pointed to data showing that Bitcoin's current price discovery phase could be marked by dramatic swings. Specifically, he noted that order books are unusually thin at these record-high levels due to a lack of established support and resistance levels. This situation sets the stage for what he describes as an “easy up, easy down” scenario.CryptoQuant’s data illustrates how Bitcoin has previously moved sharply through certain price ranges with minimal volume, particularly during the last bull cycle. For example, during previous rallies, Bitcoin saw price jumps within the $20,000–$22,000, $24,000–$26,000, and $41,000–$43,000 ranges, where low liquidity allowed the price to escalate with little resistance. Source: CryptoQuant Now, with almost no trading volume above the $72,000 mark , Bitcoin's path to new highs could be similarly volatile. The lack of strong volume at these higher levels suggests the market remains in a price discovery phase, where the absence of clear support and resistance levels makes sudden price movements more likely.Essentially, this means Bitcoin’s climb above $89K could experience both quick gains and rapid pullbacks as the market navigates unfamiliar territory.Already, since reaching its peak of $89,956 today, Bitcoin's price has declined and briefly dropped as low as $85,500 before stabilizing above $86,200 at press time. Meanwhile, market participants expect the current bull trend to push Bitcoin to $100,000 before a major correction sets in.Robert Kiyosaki Suggests Taking Profit from Bitcoin at $100KIn a tweet today, finance expert Robert Kiyosaki remarked that, with Bitcoin above $88K, he intends to continue buying until it surpasses $100,000, after which he would stop, advising against greed. “Always remember… hogs get fat, pigs get slaughtered. Don’t be a pig,” he warned . This suggests that investors should take profit and be cautious once Bitcoin reaches the $100K threshold.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/12/bitcoin-surges-past-89k-with-thin-order-books-easy-up-easy-down-phase/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitcoin-surges-past-89k-with-thin-order-books-easy-up-easy-down-phase,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

ES Pablo Hernández de Cos, a former governor of the Bank of Spain who has called for the European Central Bank to work on a digital euro, will become the general manager of the Bank for International Settlements in July, the organization said in a release on Monday.  Hernández de Cos will oversee the operations of the BIS, known as the ""central banks of central banks,"" starting July 1 for a five-year term. He will replace Agustín Carstens.  The Basel-based organization, which is owned by 63 central banks, has conducted much work in the crypto sector in recent years. It's worked with several central banks on central bank digital currency projects to improve cross-border payments, privacy and anonymity and advocated for a unified ledger. CBDCs are digital assets issued by central banks.  Last year, Hernández de Cos said that a digital euro could aid payment innovation. He was also chair of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which finalized global crypto-banking rules in 2022.

36182044,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652681,1731423648,"Dogecoin Price May Explode By 10,200% Based On Classic Chart Pattern: Expert","Henrik Zeberg, a prominent macroeconomist known for his expertise in business cycles and Head Macro Economist at Swissblock, released a technical analysis for the Dogecoin price by popular demand. Within the monthly chart of DOGE/USD, Zeberg highlights potential future prices based on Fibonacci extensions and a specific chart pattern known as the “Rounding Bottom.” Will Dogecoin Price Hit $29? Zeberg’s technical approach draws heavily on the historical performance of Dogecoin, suggesting that its price might follow a bullish trajectory mirrored in previous cycles. In his analysis, he points out, “DOGE seems to develop a Rounding Bottom structure in each Cycle. We observe how each cycle has produced higher and higher levels into the Euphoria phase.” The Rounding Bottom is a proven chart pattern often seen in financial markets which signals a reversal or a significant shift from a downward trend to an upward trend. The pattern is recognized by its gradual, rounded recovery from a low point, resembling the shape of a bowl or a saucer. This pattern indicates a slow and steady accumulation phase among buyers, followed by a gradual increase in price and demand. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price To $1 Soon? Textbook Weekly Golden Cross Shows What’s Coming Next The formation of a Rounding Bottom begins when an asset hits a new low and then slowly starts to recover, with buyers gradually entering the market, wary of the downtrend but starting to gain confidence as prices stabilize. As the asset’s price ascends, it reflects increased buying pressure and a decline in selling pressure, suggesting a shift in market sentiment from bearish to bullish. To confirm a Rounding Bottom, the price must break through the resistance level that initially led to the pattern’s formation, often marked by the highest point of the curve before the asset’s price began to fall. For the Dogecoin price, this is the price level around $0.49 which Zeberg identifies as the first price target. The breakout typically needs to be accompanied by an increase in volume and can signal a long-term bullish trend. If DOGE manages to break this resistance in the coming days, the future could be massively bullish. Related Reading: Dogecoin Descending Triangle Could Hint At Next Destination For DOGE Zeberg utilized Fibonacci levels to provide specific future price targets for Dogecoin. The Fibonacci extension levels specifically marked on the chart for Dogecoin include the 1.27 Fib ($0.4924) which Zeberg labels as target 1 with a potential gain of 75%. The next price target for the Dogecoin price is the 1.618 Fib at $0.08030 which is referred to as target 2 with an anticipated increase of 180% by Zeberg. The 2.618 Fib at $3.2738 is marked as target 3, an ambitious goal representing an 8x increase. Moreover, the 3.618 Fib at $13.3641 and 4.618 at $54.4064 are also marked, though not explicitly linked to immediate targets, indicating very optimistic long-term possibilities should the market enter another phase of euphoria akin to past cycles. In discussing these targets, Zeberg cautions, “Could we see even more crazy development? Nothing is certain – but the setup looks like a repetition of what we have seen in earlier phases.” This statement refers to Zeberg’s main target for this bull run, which stands between the 3.618 and 4.618 Fibonacci levels at $29, assuming the entire market remains in a mania phase for an extended period. In this scenario, Dogecoin would achieve a gain of 10,200%. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.41.

36182590,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=101244,1731422003,Analyst Warns of Dogecoin Correction After Sell Signal Flashes on Multiple Timeframes,"Market analyst Ali Martinez has warned of an imminent Dogecoin correction as the indicator flashes a sell signal on multiple timeframes. Dogecoin’s face-melting uptrend may be discontinued in the short term after a remarkable, bullish explosion by the largest meme coin by market cap. For context, Dogecoin has surged an impressive 123% in the past seven days, leading to a broader market uptrend.Dogecoin’s impressive performance becomes more evident in the 30-day timeframe, as it has grown a remarkable 224%, reaching price levels last seen in over three years . Notably, this price appreciation is influenced by multiple factors, including favorable macroeconomics and its ties with Elon Musk, who was pivotal in Donald Trump’s election conquest.Meanwhile, analyst Ali Martinez has warned that this uptrend may be shortlived, at least for now, following multiple timeframe indications. The analyst noted that Dogecoin could retrace from current price levels before its next leg up.TD Sequential Indicator Shows Possible RetracementIn a Tuesday tweet , Martinez shared that the TD Sequential indicator has flashed a sell signal on multiple Dogecoin chart timeframes, pointing to a possible retracement. Notably, the indicator shows this sell signal on Dogecoin’s 4-hour and 12-hour timeframes while also forming on the daily chart. With the signal, Martinez warned that Dogecoin may be choppy in the near term, relinquishing some of its gains before the next bullish phase. However, the seasoned analyst maintained a bullish future outlook for the meme coin, noting the impending correction was only temporary.Dogecoin Technical AnalysisNotably, technical analysis backs Martinez’s assertions of a short-term price correction. In the 4-hour timeframe, Dogecoin’s relative strength indicator (RSI) stands at 67.24, showing that the leading meme coin is drawing closer to being overbought.Furthermore, the MACD indicator shows Dogecoin could take a bearish turn, with the MACD line at 0.004583 and the signal line at 0.03645. The MACD line is headed downward, signaling a crossover may be imminent. Dogecoin Technical Analysis Broader Market Recovery?Meanwhile, Dogecoin is not the only asset seemingly correcting. The broader market has retraced from its daily highs in the past hours, signaling that the crypto market may be heading for consolidation.Bitcoin, for instance, has retraced 3.8% from its $89,956 high today. Ethereum and Solana have also corrected 5.3% and 6.67% from their daily highs, respectively.Martinez also warned of the retracement, citing a spike in Bitcoin's Google search. In the analysis , he encouraged caution, noting that retail interest in the crypto firstborn always spearheads a price drop.In the meantime, Bitcoin trades at $86,320, while Dogecoin exchange hands at $0.358.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | DOGE | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/12/analyst-warns-of-dogecoin-correction-after-sell-signal-flashes-on-multiple-timeframes/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=analyst-warns-of-dogecoin-correction-after-sell-signal-flashes-on-multiple-timeframes,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

36182589,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=101241,1731420914,Analyst Calls for Caution Amid Surging Retail Interest In Bitcoin; Here’s Why,"Ali Martinez, a technical and on-chain crypto analyst, advises investors to be cautious following a surging retail interest in Bitcoin (BTC). The analyst issued the notice today in a tweet, emphasizing that his warning is not bearish but a word of caution due to the rising interest in Bitcoin among retail investors. Bitcoin Underperforms During Rising Searches for BTC Martinez pointed out that even though growing retail interest in Bitcoin usually signals more capital inflow into the market, increased search for the premier asset historically aligns with price corrections. This suggests that the price of Bitcoin usually falls whenever its search activity increases. Providing more context, Martinez called attention to Bitcoin corrections in 2021, which coincided with spikes in search activity for the premier asset. According to the accompanying chart, Bitcoin registered a 30.47% correction on January 9, 2021, when Google searches for the top asset surged above 80. The following month, on February 21, the premier asset’s price also plunged 26.28%, coinciding with surging search activity above 75. Furthermore, Bitcoin saw a correction of 27.57% on April 14, 2021, when its global search neared a score of 70. Lastly, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap witnessed another hefty correction of 50.85% between May and June 2021, coinciding with a Google search volume of 100. Notably, the chart showed that Bitcoin’s current search volume was hovering around 75, suggesting that BTC could witness another correction if the historical trend repeats itself. Recent Search Activity and Bitcoin Price Reaction According to data from Google Trends, the global search for Bitcoin stands at 52 at press time. The score peaked at 100 yesterday at 21:36 (UTC) and subsequently retraced to 72 an hour later. It has now declined to 52 in the hours leading up to press time. Meanwhile, Bitcoin, which attempted to break above a record high of $90,000 earlier today, has plunged to the $85,000 mark. Bitcoin is currently trading at $85,560, down 4.88% from its all-time high of $89,956. Binance Founder Warns Upcoming Volatility Besides Martinez, many crypto stakeholders have warned investors to exercise caution amid spikes in Bitcoin’s price. Last week, Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) warned that Bitcoin could experience significant volatility following its surge to an all-time high. He forecasted that the premier asset would register significant dips and highs in the coming days and encouraged investors to brace themselves for imminent volatility. “Control your greed.

42415539,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOJujm,1731420000,Time for Crypto to Put the Pedal to the Floor,"In the wake of the U.S. Presidential Election, I was reading various round-ups and post-mortems when one article here at CoinDesk stood out as particularly good. EY professional Paul Brody argued that blockchain’s path to success lies in the extreme competition that it fosters.  Brody compares blockchain to the slow ascendency of Voice over IP (VoIP), writing: “Despite the internet’s inherent drawbacks, it has come to dominate communications because it is cheap, widely available and internet communications services are intensely competitive.”  Frankly, I think the comparison is inspired. I couldn’t help but feel that Brody glossed over one crucial piece of the equation, though.  Aaron Brogan is the founder and managing attorney of Brogan Law, a law firm specializing in cryptocurrency regulation  With respect to VoIP, he writes, “the entire cycle of deregulation, monopoly break up, reconfiguration, and shift to internet and mobile took place over 20 years.”  This comparison treats deregulation as a foregone conclusion, but I think it is actually the crucial blocking issue of our time. Since January 2021, Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler has implemented policy to stifle cryptocurrency’s development.  Now, with Donald Trump ascendent, the industry can expect a new SEC chair and new policy. But that will not be the end of the story.  Regulatory Arbitrage  The truth is, deregulation is not something that happens on its own. Cryptocurrency's value depends in large part on achieving it. These next four years will provide an opportunity to do so, but we should expect a battle. Here’s why.  Capital markets in the United States have been regulated by essentially one regime for nearly a hundred years. In the wake of the Great Depression, a series of legislation created the SEC and empowered it to implement certain requirements for companies seeking to raise public capital. This “full array” of securities regulation included the obligation to publish a prospectus, ongoing reporting requirements, and the requirement that certain financial intermediaries be registered as broker-dealers or national security exchanges.  Each aspect of this regime may be justifiable consumer protection, but the result of it all together is that accessing public capital markets is prohibitively expensive for all but the largest businesses. The accounting firm PWC estimates the average cost of even the smallest public offerings as between $2 and $12 million. Ongoing compliance is similarly expensive, such that even the SEC has recognized that “[t]he disclosure requirements place a disproportionate burden on smaller reporting companies in terms of the cost of ... compliance.”  There are a number of exemptions that allow the sale of so-called exempt securities, including Reg D, Reg A, and Reg CF. But these regimes seriously limit secondary market liquidity, and access to secondary markets is a crucial component to attracting primary investment.  The result is a drag on the real economy. So much that the management consulting firm McKinsey & Co. identified access to working capital financing as a limiting factor in the productivity of American small businesses.  Cryptocurrency was a technological development, but the effect of that development was to create “regulatory arbitrage.” Without the old sclerotic restraints, the fresh capital markets that cryptocurrency exposed exploded almost immediately. In 2018 alone, cryptocurrency firms raised $20.3 billion in token offerings—compare this to the anemic $500 million raised in Reg CF offerings in 2023.  The difference was not just in the primary issuance. Secondary cryptocurrency markets were incredibly liquid almost immediately, which likely helped projects raise funds.  Although many companies that conducted initial coin offerings in 2017 and 2018 failed and lost all value quickly, a number of projects funded in this boom subsequently experienced sustained increases in value. Polkadot (DOT) raised $65 million in a public token sale in 2017, and now has a market cap of nearly $7 billion. Solana (SOL) raised $1.76 million in a 2020 public token sale at a price of $0.22 per token, which has now appreciated more than 900x to $198.89 per token. Chainlink (LINK) raised $32 million in a 2017 ICO priced at $.11 per token, which has since appreciated 123x to $13.56 per token.  Even though crypto has its boom-bust cycles, Chair Gensler’s 2021 ascendancy cast a pall over the industry independent of the usual volatility. Just look at the CoinDesk 20 index of the largest cryptocurrencies—only one launched after January 2021.  Looking back now, this regulatory intervention makes sense. If the greatest power of cryptocurrency is to create plausible methods to avoid over-intrusive regulatory requirements, then its existence is a direct challenge to regulators' power.  Cryptocurrency and the American economy as a whole are not zero-sum competitions. When crypto projects and small businesses succeed, we are all enriched. The competition between the SEC and the cryptocurrency industry, on the other hand, is zero-sum. Either the SEC can ban these markets, or cryptocurrency projects can access them. Both cannot be true at once.  The Years Ahead  Now, Donald Trump has promised to lift the implicit ban on crypto projects, that “[t]he rules will be written by people who love your industry.” The industry is rightly cheering his election as a bullish indicator.  But hold off on the victory lap—this is just the beginning. When you recognize that crypto disempowers the SEC, it is obvious that the agency will never give up freely. Whoever Mr. Trump picks as SEC chair will be friendlier to the industry than Chair Gensler by default, but they will have the same incentives to preserve authority. And four years from their appointment they will be gone, and anyone could take their place.  What the crypto industry won on Nov. 5, then, was a chance. From now until January 20, 2029 we have to push the pedal to the floor—to ensure that whoever comes next at the SEC can never disempower the industry again.  The way I see it, that task is two-pronged. First, the industry has to continue to expand retail adoption to gain enough consumer support that it is indispensable. When Uber’s feet were being held to the coals, it was retail customers' messages to politicians that saved it. Crypto is the natural sector to repeat this playbook, so our value proposition to the retail voter should be undeniable.  Second, we should work with our new allies in Washington to implement a legislative solution to permanently inculcate cryptocurrency as a regulatory third way. There can be no half-measures. Only Congress can build a foundation beyond the reach of future regimes.  The clock is ticking.

42415534,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOJuj9,1731420000,Crypto Anti-Money Laundering Specialist Notabene Raises $14.5M,"An important deadline looms at the end of this year for firms to comply with Europe’s update of its Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR) to include crypto transactions.  Notabene CEO Pelle Braendgaard believes Donald Trump will emulate what the European Commission is doing in order to bring trading volume back to the U.S.  Notabene, a startup that helps cryptocurrency trading firms comply with anti-money laundering (AML) rules, has raised $14.5 million Series B funding led by DRW Venture Capital, with participation from funds managed by Apollo, Nextblock, ParaFi Capital, and Wintermute.  Bringing crypto into line with the rest of the financial world, global AML watchdog the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has set out recommendations for regulators – known as the “Travel Rule” – that requires crypto companies like exchanges, wallet providers, and payment processors to securely exchange information about sender and receiver of transactions.  Aiming to be a kind of SWIFT for crypto transactions, Notabene’s network effect is growing with 165 companies using the platform, including some of the largest virtual asset service providers (VASPs) globally such as Copper, OKX, and Ramp.  The platform’s CEO, Pelle Braendgaard, expects an increase in transaction volume on Notabene (around $2 billion worth of daily transactions on average), as a deadline looms at the end of this year for firms to comply with Europe’s update of its Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR) to include crypto transactions.  “EU companies will have to report if they're not getting travel information from, say, a large, unregulated offshore exchange,” Braendgaard said in an interview. “This is really pushing the industry into compliance globally. So these EU rules are not just about the EU, it's really about getting this working globally on that particular front.”  In the U.S., under the coming Donald Trump-led administration, Braendgaard believes travel rule guidance will be pushed forward more dynamically, as it was during the previous Trump administration, because it’s about bringing the industry back to America.  “If you look at what the European Commission is doing with the TFR and MiCA [the Markets in Crypto Assets regime], they want all the crypto trading to happen in the EU,” Braendgaard said. “And of course, the U.S. is going to take the same approach, I believe. Because it doesn't make sense that they're sending all of this money offshore.”  Notabene’s Series B funding round also included existing investors CMT Digital, F-Prime, Green Visor Capital, Illuminate Financial, Jump Capital, Signature Ventures, and Y Combinator.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/11/12/crypto-anti-money-laundering-specialist-notabene-raises-145m,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d37a1fab90b3c18790020cedd4a1c420ba630eb-2500x1667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This major acquisition, completed between Oct. 31 and Nov. 10, represents the most substantial buy since the company began heavily investing in cryptocurrency over four years ago. Led by co-founder and chairman Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy's Bitcoin-focused strategy now brings its total holdings to an impressive $24 billion, calculated at Bitcoin's recent record price of over $86,500. Michael Saylor initially incorporated Bitcoin into MicroStrategy’s investment approach in 2020, citing it as a hedge against inflation. Initially, the company relied on cash reserves for its Bitcoin acquisitions but soon shifted to other financial tools, including proceeds from stock sales and convertible debt. These moves increased MicroStrategy’s purchasing power, allowing it to take full advantage of Bitcoin's rising value. This strategy has proven exceptionally lucrative for the company, enabling it to outperform major U.S. stocks like Nvidia since mid-2020. In the same period, MicroStrategy’s stock surged by over 2,500%, outpacing even Bitcoin's remarkable 660% growth. The company's stock recently soared by up to 24%, reaching a record $335, following the announcement of this new Bitcoin purchase. As of Nov. 10, MicroStrategy and its subsidiaries, headquartered in Tysons Corner, Virginia, collectively hold about 279,420 Bitcoin, acquired at a total cost of roughly $11.9 billion . The average price per Bitcoin for these purchases, including fees and expenses, sits at approximately $42,692. This substantial Bitcoin reserve has solidified MicroStrategy’s reputation in the financial and cryptocurrency markets, as it continues to hold more Bitcoin than any other publicly traded company, excluding BlackRock’s U.S. exchange-traded fund. By maintaining such a large Bitcoin position, MicroStrategy has positioned itself as a pioneer in corporate cryptocurrency investment. This unique strategy, driven by Saylor’s belief in Bitcoin as a reliable store of value, has set the company apart from other U.S. firms. Saylor’s commitment to Bitcoin has remained steadfast, with MicroStrategy using various financial tools to expand its holdings. The decision to embrace convertible debt and stock issuance has amplified the company's influence in the cryptocurrency market, leveraging traditional financial methods to acquire digital assets on a significant scale. This latest purchase reaffirms MicroStrategy’s role as a leader among corporate Bitcoin holders and highlights the growing trend of companies embracing digital assets as part of their long-term strategies. With Bitcoin’s recent price rise and increased acceptance as a digital store of value, MicroStrategy’s significant stake reflects a broader shift in corporate finance, as companies begin to view cryptocurrency as a strategic asset. MicroStrategy’s growing Bitcoin holdings underscore the firm’s commitment to digital currency, positioning it as a critical player in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. MicroStrategy’s bold approach demonstrates how companies can diversify their holdings with digital assets. As Bitcoin becomes increasingly mainstream, the company's large-scale investments may encourage other corporations to explore similar strategies, further cementing cryptocurrency’s role in the financial markets. This strategic shift by MicroStrategy exemplifies the potential for digital assets to provide companies with both growth opportunities and resilience against inflation.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/microstrategy-makes-2b-bitcoin-investment-its-biggest-since-2020,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36178107.jpeg

The price of SHIB rose by more than 70% over the past week, to the delight of investors and dealers. The trading volume has surged to as high as 246%, reaching an unprecedented high of $6.18 billion, putting to rest doubt over where SHIB will trend next. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Strategic US Hub Plan Sends SHIB Price On A 23% Moonshot SHIB & The Trump Effect Analysts however contend that the rise in SHIB can be ascribed to the rampant zeal witnessed in the cryptocurrency space fueled by some recent events in the US, including Donald Trump’s election victory, which has invigorated market sentiment – and his endorsement of Elon Musk for a proposed crypto department once he starts work as president. Amidst this anticipation, SHIB has set its sights on a rather steep growth curve. Currently situated a notch below where it should be, this degree of undervaluation points to the potential for a sharp uptrend within a few days from now. In the medium term, SHIB’s price forecast is rather optimistic given the projected 91.16% increase in the price over the next 6 months. This suggests that this meme token could be on an upward trajectory for quite some time as it cements its position among the leading crypto assets. Market Sentiment On The Rise The cryptocurrency landscape, on the other hand, paints a much broader and more optimistic picture, thereby raising a lot of expectations around SHIB. Market experts believe that the victory of Trump has created a market euphoria that complements the rally of Bitcoin and the rest of the digital assets and helps in the upward trajectory of SHIB. Whale Activity Indicates Interest Apart from market mood, on-chain data shows an increase in activity by important SHIB holders, known as “whales.” Data by IntoTheBlock shows that early November saw a notable rise in the volume of these high-value transactions—6.47 trillion SHIB overall. A high level of whale activity typically indicates a strong interest from significant investors, as they position themselves for potential future gains. An indicator that SHIB may be in for another round of price jumps is this pattern of accumulation among large participants. Still fairly fresh off of a confirmed Hidden Bull Divergence and holding broken out, $SHIB (Shiba Inu), in the midst of a roaring Bitcoin market, can be getting ready for its next level performance towards the $0.00081 target!

XRP trades close to a prolonged supply zone.  XRP's nascent options market listed on Deribit shows growing bullish sentiment among traders.

A call option gives the holder the right but not the obligation to purchase the underlying asset at a pre-decided price at a later date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market.  Additionally, a notable open interest is seen in call options at strikes $1.00 and $1.10 expiring on Dec. 27, a sign the rally is expected to continue well into the year-end.  As of this writing, XRP traded close to 65 cents – a critical level above which selling pressure has remained robust since October 2023.

Today, XRP registered a loss of 4% in its 24-hour performance, trading at $0.5841. This comes despite Bitcoin reaching an all-time high above $82K, with over 3% gains today.Meanwhile, at its current price, XRP is 14% higher than its lower threshold from a week ago. XRP even reached a multi-week high of $0.616 yesterday before the recent retracement. However, when looking at the weekly performance of other top-ranking assets—Bitcoin included—XRP's gains appear relatively modest.For example, Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE) have surged by over 80% this week despite recent pullbacks. XRP's weaker performance compared to its rivals has sparked significant discussion in the crypto community, with analysts attempting to provide reasons for holders to remain bullish on XRP.In a recent analysis , ""Block Bull,"" a widely followed trader, issued a bold timeline for XRP’s full-scale bull run. According to the analyst, it's not yet time for XRP's violent bull run, but it will be in seven weeks. He emphasized that it will take another seven weeks for XRP enthusiasts to see their wildest dreams become a reality.How the 7-Week Timeline Came About: Historical TrendsThe analyst derived this bold timeline based on the time it took XRP to start its bull run in previous cycles following Bitcoin halving events. The chart accompanying the analysis showed that XRP took 252 days post-Bitcoin halving to begin its explosive rally in 2017 , which culminated in XRP reaching an all-time high.In the 2020/2021 cycle, XRP also took 252 days post-halving before breaking out and rallying by over 942%. According to this analysis, the timeline for XRP’s next run is still 49 days (or seven weeks) away, which would mark the 252-day point from the most recent Bitcoin halving—at which time XRP is expected to commence its dramatic surge.Notably, other analysts agree with Block Bull’s perspective, predicting that XRP’s surge is imminent. Some have even pointed to other metrics, such as symmetric triangle breakouts , to support this view.However, there is growing skepticism about XRP within the crypto community. Numerous bold predictions about XRP's potential have failed to materialize in recent times. As a result, some critics have even suggested that Cardano (ADA) could overtake XRP as XRP enthusiasts continue to wait for the long-anticipated bull run.",NEUTRAL,ADA | XRP,ADA | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/12/post-halving-patterns-confirm-xrp-still-needs-7-weeks-for-bull-run-to-start/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=post-halving-patterns-confirm-xrp-still-needs-7-weeks-for-bull-run-to-start,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 2,645.58. +3.37%  Bitcoin (BTC): $87,452.37 +6.46%  Ether (ETH): $3,289.79 +2.79%  S&P 500: 6,001.35 +0.1%  Gold: $2,603.09 -0.31%  Nikkei 225: 39,376.09 -0.40%  Top Stories  Bitcoin came within touching distance of $90,000 in volatile trading during the European morning, swinging between highs well above $89,000 before falling below $86,000 as it encountered resistance on its path to another milestone. It was recently trading around $87,400. The surge in the last 24 hours has seen nearly $900 million of liquidations in crypto-tracked futures, equally distributed between bullish and bearish bets at almost $450 million apiece, according to Coinglass data. Notwithstanding the price swings, bitcoin is around 6% higher over 24 hours, outperforming the wider crypto market, which has risen just under 3.5%, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index.  Ether ETFs registered record inflows of $295.5 million on Monday, with BlackRock's ETHA and Fidelity's FETH both gathering a net $100 million. Their bitcoin equivalents saw their second-highest-ever daily inflows, recording gains of $1.1 billion as BTC's market cap climbed to $1.78 trillion to overtake silver as the world's eighth-largest asset. ""Assets in the US spot bitcoin ETFs are now up to $84b, which is 2/3 of the way to what gold ETFs have, all the sudden there's a decent shot they surpass gold before their first birthday (we predicted it would take 3-4yrs),"" Eric Balchunas, a senior analyst at Bloomberg, said on X.  DOGE climbed to over $0.43 during the European morning, enjoying gains of around 50% in the last 24 hours. That's the memecoin's highest price since May 2021, when it hit an all-time high of $0.71. DOGE-tracked futures saw over $68 million in cumulative losses. Those liquidations were the largest for dogecoin this year, with open interest nearing a lifetime record from April. Much of the current rally has been fueled by bullish sentiment around the meme’s endorsement by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk in the Trump administration. DOGE subsequently retreated to below $0.40 as the crypto market fell, but remains over 30% higher in the last 24 hours.  Chart of the Day  Bitcoin has rallied to test a trendline resistance formed by the twin peaks of 2021, aligning itself with movements in the Nasdaq-to-S&P 500 ratio.  Historically, the ratio, representing tech optimism on Wall Street, has been a reliable indicator for BTC, guiding the cryptocurrency through various market conditions.

The country has given itself to periodically acquiring Bitcoin until its pro-crypto President Nayib Bukere decided they would buy 1 BTC a day on March 16.El Salvador’s portfolio tracker shows it has acquired 6,154 BTC since then at an average price of $44,324. Meanwhile, the stash is now worth $502 million, with 99.32% of its valuation ($136 million) an unrealized profit.Bhutan’s Bitcoin Stash Crosses $1.1BThe small Asian country, which acquired Bitcoin through its mining activities, now holds over $1 billion worth of the crypto firstborn. When its stash went public two months ago, Bhutan’s Druk Holdings held 13,036 BTC, worth $770 million.However, Bitcoin’s explosion past $88,000 has ensured that Bhutan’s 12,574 BTC has a valuation of $1.1 billion despite selling 935 BTC in October. Notably, Bhutan is the fourth-largest Bitcoin-holding government and the second to officially hold the asset.Meanwhile, the German government missed out on a $1.7 billion profit by selling its stash a few months back. The Germans sold 50,000 BTC seized from Movie2K.to, a film piracy firm, at an average price of $54,000, realizing $2.7 billion.At the current market price of $88,637, the 50,000 bitcoins would be worth $4.43 billion. Although the $2.7 billion was substantial in the contest that it realized the stash from seizure, the Germans would have had an extra $1.73 billion if it had waited till now.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/12/microstrategys-bitcoin-holdings-now-worth-24-9b-tesla-1b-el-salvador-550m-and-bhutan-1-1b/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=microstrategys-bitcoin-holdings-now-worth-24-9b-tesla-1b-el-salvador-550m-and-bhutan-1-1b,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

42415549,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOJusa,1731416059,Bitcoin 'Shrimps' Buying the Historic Rally as Whales Offload: Van Straten,"Investors who hold less than one BTC continue to accumulate, as they have been doing for the past two months.  Humpback whales who hold over 10K BTC, continue to distribute coins, extending the two-month trend.  Long-term holders, on average, seem unfazed about this rally and continue holding onto bitcoin, demanding higher prices.  Bitcoin's {{BTC}} blockchain data reveals that small addresses continue to accumulate BTC, even as whales stick to their ""sell on rise"" strategy.  BTC, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, nearly tested the $90,000 threshold early Tuesday and has since pulled back to trade near $87,400 at press time, still up 27% on a seven-day basis, according to CoinDesk data.  The 40,000-foot view tells us that the recent buying pressure has largely originated from the Nasdaq-listed Coinbase (COIN) exchange, often considered a proxy for the stateside institutional activity. However, granular data reveals that small addresses – often referred to as ""shrimps"" – are actively boosting their coin stash as they chase the ongoing price rally.  Shrimps continue to be the smart money  Glassnode data shows a breakdown of all cohorts from less than one BTC, referred to as ""shrimps,"" up to over 10,000 BTC, called ""humpback whales."" A value closer to one shows that cohorts are accumulating tokens, while a near zero value represents distribution.  All cohorts other than humpback whales have accumulated bitcoin for the past two months. This has coincided with bitcoin's upward price trajectory, as it climbed from approximately $55,000 in September to just shy of $90,000 in November.  The data challenges the narrative that whales are the smart money of the ecosystem. The feature image shows that whales have been selling into price strength, while retail has been buying the rally. CoinDesk research shows how retail has evolved into smart money over time.  Three months of supply outpacing issuance  When we aggregate the data from all cohorts, including miners, exchanges, and retail investors, over the past 30 days, it shows that all groups combined have accumulated a total of 26,000 BTC. But again, this demand has been consistent for the past three months since September, outstripping supply and issuance.  Long-term vs short-term holders  Glassnode defines long-term holders (LTHs) as investors who have held bitcoin for more than 155 days. We typically see them distribute bitcoin into price strength, which we have seen on previous occasions when bitcoin has hit all-time highs in 2017 and 2021, and accumulate at bottoms.  This time, however, they seem to be holding on to their balances, a sign of bullish expectations. Perhaps, prices are going to have to go much higher for LTHs to part with their bitcoin.  Currently, LTHs hold 78% of the bitcoin circulating supply approximately over 15 million coins. In the past month, they have reduced their supply by just around 3%, but compared to 2017 or 2021, when their supply dropped as much as 20%.  The inverse can be seen with short-term holders (STHs) or those who hold coins for less than 155 days and tend to buy bitcoin on euphoric days like Monday, when bitcoin shot up 10%. Their supply is near all-time lows, albeit with a brief tick higher. During previous bull markets, STHs have held as much as 35% or 50% of the supply.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,James Van Straten,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/12/bitcoin-shrimps-emerge-as-the-new-smart-money-as-whales-offload-their-stash-van-straten,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/abe451a713c224ce48b5d454be5440cdeaa6af34-1290x549.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This comes as the crypto market continues to trend upward, with Dogecoin standing out as one of the top gainers. Dogecoin Price To Explode And Reach $18 In an X post, Martinez predicted that the Dogecoin price could explode by 4,500% and rally to $18. He stated that this will happen through a test of the middle or upper boundary of the channel, which puts the DOGE target at $2.40 or $18. Dogecoin will need to test the upper boundary to reach the $18 target, while only a test of the middle boundary will put the price at $2.40. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Signals Bullish Continuation With SuperTrend Rising, Here’s The Next Target After Beating $81,000 In an earlier X post, Ali Martinez offered a more bullish outlook for the Dogecoin price. He predicted that the foremost meme coin could rise to as high as $23.26 in this bull run. He claimed that Dogecoin was about to go “parabolic” and cited historical patterns to prove why such a parabolic rally could happen. Based on historical patterns, the analyst stated that a potential top might lie between 1.618 and 2.272 Fibonacci levels, which would put the Dogecoin price between $3.95 and $23.26. Martinez also alluded to Elon Musk’s impact on Dogecoin when he previously stated that DOGE could reach $23 in this market cycle. The Dogecoin price has been on a massive bull run since Donald Trump won the elections, partly because of Elon Musk’s proposed Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E), which would positively impact the meme coin. For context, the Doogecoin is up 139% since Trump’s victory. Update On The DOGE Bull Run Crypto analyst Master Kenobi, who rightly predicted the start of the Dogecoin bull run, has provided an update on what could happen next for the Dogecoin price. He stated that DOGE could range between $0.33 and $0.40 for a while before it pushes to its current all-time high (ATH) at $0.73. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Enters ‘Second Breakout Of The Cycle,’ Analyst Puts Peak Above $150,000 The analyst further remarked that there will likely be a potential rejection in the initial phase, which he claimed is welcome. This rejection will then be followed by a consolidation period of around one to two weeks, similar to the previous cycles. The analyst also raised the possibility that the Dogecoin price is already replicating its price action in the last cycle. If so, Master Kenobi remarked that this sets the Dogecoin price for a breakout and strengthens the probability of a continued upward trend. Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade predicted that Dogecoin could rise to as high as $30 if it mirrors its price action in the 2021 bull run. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.41, up over 48% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Dogecoin is experiencing a surge in market activity, driven by increased interest from retail investors only days after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election. Recent data from Santiment, a market intelligence platform, highlights a notable increase in smaller Dogecoin wallets over the past month.The report revealed that wallets holding less than 100,000 DOGE have increased by 74,885 over the last 30 days. However, while retail activity accelerates, larger wallet categories, such as shark and whale accounts, have decreased by 350 during the same period. Meanwhile, 108 whale wallets have recently re-entered the Dogecoin market, contributing to Dogecoin's rally above $0.40, marking its highest level in over three years. Santiment noted that sustained momentum for Dogecoin depends on simultaneous accumulation by both retail investors and large stakeholders.The platform added that the coming days will be crucial in determining whether more sharks and whales will return to the market to support the ongoing rally.Dogecoin Flowing out of Exchanges Concurrently, data from IntoTheBlock reveals a sharp increase in Dogecoin outflows from exchanges, a trend often associated with accumulation. Over the past 24 hours, outflow volume has surged by 157.64%, reflecting a strong movement of DOGE into private wallets. This trend becomes even more pronounced when viewed over longer periods. Over the past week, outflows have increased by 434.51%, while the 30-day outflow volume has risen dramatically by 1,820.58%. These sustained outflows indicate heightened interest from long-term holders, suggesting robust support for Dogecoin’s bullish momentum.Potential Parabolic GrowthAmid these developments, analysts are closely monitoring Dogecoin’s price trajectory. Notably, technical patterns suggest the potential for a parabolic run for Dogecoin. Ali Martinez has pointed to Dogecoin’s recent breakout from a long-standing resistance trendline. This pattern, observed in previous bullish cycles, has historically preceded significant price surges. For instance, during the 2017-2018 cycle, Dogecoin’s breakout led to an 8,933% price increase, aligning with Fibonacci retracement levels. Based on historical data, Martinez identifies possible future price targets within the 1.618 to 2.272 Fibonacci levels, estimating a range between $3.95 and $23.25.",POSITIVE,DOGE,BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/12/over-107-whales-push-dogecoin-price-to-3-year-high-will-more-whales-join-the-rally/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=over-107-whales-push-dogecoin-price-to-3-year-high-will-more-whales-join-the-rally,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

42415547,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOJurK,1731411636,Top Ethereum Researcher's Dramatic Proposal Draws Standing-Room-Only Crowd in Bangkok,"BANGKOK — It's been over two years since Ethereum's community last rallied behind a big tech event. That event—the so-called Ethereum merge—marked the network's long-awaited shift to a new, more eco-friendly consensus mechanism called ""proof-of-stake.""  The core guts of the Ethereum blockchain have changed little since then. The chain's developers have pushed through a series of upgrades to enable the growth of quick and cheap ""layer-2"" blockchains, but the Ethereum community has mostly been starved of a single organizing vision—at least one that commanded the level of enthusiasm generated by the Merge.  That might soon change.  At Ethereum's Devcon conference in Bangkok on Tuesday, Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake revealed his proposal for a major redesign of Ethereum's consensus layer called ""Beam Chain.""  Beam Chain is ""a proposed redesign of the consensus layer that incorporates all of the latest and greatest ideas from the Ethereum roadmap,"" Drake said in a speech at Bangkok's Queen Sirikit National Convention Centre.  Drake's Beam Chain vision organizes a series of ""big ticket"" upgrades to Ethereum's consensus layer into a single package. The changes include adjustments to Ethereum's block production apparatus, as well as how it handles staking and zero-knowledge cryptography.  Drake's presentation was highly anticipated—coming after months of speculation online and in crypto forums that the influential Ethereum researcher, who was instrumental to the 2022 Merge upgrade, was working on something major. Drake delivered his remarks to a packed convention hall, with onlookers spilling out into the hallway outside of the event's main stage.  The Beam Chain won't entail any immediate changes to Ethereum, or even anything radically different from what's already on the chain's roadmap. It does, however, propose a major change to how Ethereum's future upgrades are organized.  Today, Ethereum upgrades its core code roughly once per year. Drake proposes continuing to make incremental upgrades to the chain each year to address ""low-hanging fruit,"" but then knocking out big changes in one fell swoop a few years from now.  The Beam Chain would focus on Ethereum's consensus layer, also called the Beacon Chain, which is the part of the network that handles how transactions get processed and recorded. ""The beacon chain is kind of old,"" Drake said. ""The spec was frozen five years ago, and in those five years so much has happened.""  According to Drake, the Ethereum developers today have a ""much better understanding"" of how to adapt to maximal extractable value—strategies used by sophisticated traders to wring extra profit from Ethereum, sometimes at the cost of regular users. The past half-decade has also yielded valuable breakthroughs in zero knowledge technology, said Drake, and the Ethereum blockchain has built up ""technical debt"" that challenges developers' ability to develop the chain quickly and securely.  Among the focus areas for the Beam Chain will be ""faster slots"" and ""faster finality,"" meaning ramping the frequency with which blocks are added to the chain, as well as increasing the number of transactions included per-block. This could eventually mean the introduction of single slot finality, where blocks with transaction data can be finalized immediately, meaning that information would become permanent right away and impossible to alter.  Currently, it takes about 15 minutes on Ethereum for a block to finalize. By decreasing the finality time, the finalization process would become more efficient for applications or exchanges that have a high transaction throughput. Having that 15 minute delay creates opportunities for MEV to be extracted and raises the risk of reorgs.  However, there are some concerns about centralization with faster finalization times, since there's more computing power needed, with expensive hardware. Developers will need to balance the tradeoff between shortening finalization times and computing power.  The Beam Chain also includes a proposal to bake zero-knowledge cryptography deeper into the fiber of Ethereum's base network.  Ethereum developers have embraced a roadmap involving layer-2 rollups, which are auxiliary blockchains atop Ethereum where transactions can be executed quickly and at a lower cost, and then settled down to the base chain.  As part of that, rollups have embraced a new type of technology that uses zero-knowledge proofs to help with the scaling of the blockchain. Over the last two years, dozens of ZK rollups have popped up, like Polygon’s zkEVM and Matter Labs zkSync, initially driving a lot of the attention and building to these new blockchains.  With Drake’s Beam Chain proposal, support for zero-knowledge proofs will be built into the main Ethereum layer-1 chain. It's therefore reasonable to wonder what implications this might hold for the fast-growing field of ZK-powered layer-2 networks.  While the Beam chain would be an ambitious upgrade, Drake said in his talk on Tuesday that he was reluctant to call it ""Ethereum 3.0"" (people sometimes referred to Ethereum's 2022 Merge upgrade as ""Ethereum 2.0."") ""The Beam Chain is only about the consensus chain,"" said Drake, while other research is still being done into Ethereum's execution and data layers—the other core elements of the network that support things like apps and layer-2 data.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MATIC | TECHNOLOGY,"Sam Kessler, Margaux Nijkerk",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/11/12/ethereum-researcher-justin-drake-introduces-beam-chain-a-total-redesign-of-the-networks-consensus-layer,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b4d3d05ce5c1381612bd315a885c4a8ccc969d7a-2940x1592.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Will this uptrend cross $0.20? Tron is showing a recovery rally as the broader market gains momentum. Currently trading at $0.1685, TRX has risen by 5.18% over the past four days, up from the $0.1602 level.As the bull run nears a rising wedge breakout, the TRX price is teasing a high-momentum rally. Could this rally push TRON past the $0.20 mark? Let’s take a closer look.TRX Price AnalysisWith four consecutive bullish candles, Tron's price trend is now challenging the 38.20% Fibonacci level at $0.1686. This marks a rounding-bottom reversal with a neckline at the same Fibonacci level. TRX Price Chart On a broader scale, the TRX price action is forming a rising wedge pattern following the bull run in August. Year-to-date, TRX has grown by 56.34%.The rounding-bottom reversal is now challenging the overhead resistance line of the rising-wedge pattern. As the broader market recovers, the chances of a bullish breakout are increasing. TronScan Reveals Positive Network MetricsAs Tron stands on the verge of a bullish breakout, TronScan reveals positive numbers over the network. The total value locked (TVL) has surpassed $18 billion, with a total transfer volume of $14.79 billion. Tronscan Transactions over the past 24 hours have surged, approaching 9 million daily transactions, currently standing at 8.92 million. Additionally, the number of total accounts has increased by 220,000, bringing the total to 271.38 million.With increasing TVL and transaction volumes, demand for TRON is likely to continue rising.Tron Price TargetsSupporting the bullish trend, the MACD indicator has shown a positive crossover as negative histograms decline. Meanwhile, the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day SMAs remain in a positive alignment, signaling a buy signal for TRON.If the breakout occurs, the trend-based Fibonacci levels suggest targets at $0.1621 (50% Fibonacci) and $0.1959 (78.60% Fibonacci). With the broader market recovering, the likelihood of TRON reaching the psychological $0.20 level has significantly increased.On the downside, failure to break through the 38.20% Fibonacci level could lead to a pullback to the rising support trend line near $0.1650. Below that, the 23.60% level at $0.1597 serves as a crucial support level.",POSITIVE,TRX,MARKET | TRADING | TRX,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/12/will-tron-cross-0-20-with-rising-wedge-breakout-rally/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=will-tron-cross-0-20-with-rising-wedge-breakout-rally,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

This legal action follows 23 other lawsuits filed by FTX last Friday, aimed at recovering misused funds. The case was filed on Sunday in the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, where FTX seeks to reclaim $1.76 billion for its creditors. According to the lawsuit, FTX alleges that its former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), orchestrated a repurchase deal in 2021 to buy back Binance’s stake in FTX. Binance had acquired a 20% stake in FTX International and an 18.4% stake in its US branch between 2019 and 2020, making it one of FTX’s largest shareholders. However, by July 2021, Bankman-Fried paid $1.76 billion to buy back Binance’s stake using a mix of FTT tokens, Binance Coin (BNB), and Binance USD (BUSD). The FTX estate argues that the deal was fraudulent, claiming FTX was likely insolvent from its beginning and clearly balance-sheet insolvent by early 2021. The court documents also highlight testimony from Caroline Ellison, former CEO of Alameda Research, who stated that the repurchase was conducted with customer funds. Ellison, now a witness in Bankman-Fried’s criminal trial, claimed that the deal was part of an effort to cover up FTX's financial troubles. Additionally, the lawsuit accuses Zhao of attempting to ruin FTX’s reputation through what it describes as a “campaign to destroy FTX.” The estate claims that Zhao used Twitter to spread “false, misleading, and fraudulent information” to undermine FTX and turn customers away from the platform. Specifically, the document points to tweets Zhao posted on November 6, 2022, in which he announced Binance’s plan to sell its FTT holdings—then valued at $529 million. This announcement came after certain revelations regarding FTX’s finances surfaced, leading to a surge in withdrawal requests. The lawsuit contends that Zhao’s public statement on the sale was designed to maximize its market impact rather than minimize disruption, arguing that it was a strategic move to boost Binance’s market position. In response, a Binance spokesperson called the lawsuit “meritless” and pledged that Binance would “vigorously defend” itself against the allegations. This lawsuit is part of FTX’s larger strategy to recover funds lost through alleged mismanagement by SBF and Alameda Research. These lawsuits are an attempt to secure money for FTX’s creditors , who are expected to begin receiving payouts by late 2024.

As the cryptocurrency soars and whales accumulate, some market watchers suggested SOL is poised to fly to new levels soon. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly Volume Hits $60 Billion As ETH Aims For Yearly Highs Solana Hits Three-Year High Price Solana has been one of the best-performing altcoins this bull run, seeing a massive surge in the past year. The cryptocurrency recently flipped Binance Coin (BNB) as the fourth-largest crypto by market capitalization after nearing the $190 price range last Wednesday. Since then, Solana has broken past the long-awaited $200 barrier and reached a $100 billion market capitalization, cementing its title as one of the cycle’s leaders. Moreover, SOL’s surge above $200 represented a breakout from a 34-week accumulation zone, which saw the token’s price move between the $210 and $110 range. SOL closed its massive week with a 35.6% jump above $215, recording the fourth-largest weekly close in the token’s history. Additionally, Solana hit a three-year high price, challenging November 2021 levels. SolanaFloor noted that SOL has seen a 291% increase in the past year, as the cryptocurrency was trading at $56 on November 11, 2023. The token has also seen a massive 1350% surge from its price two years ago when it fell as low as $10 after FTX’s collapse. Solana’s recent performance has fueled investor and market watchers’ bullish sentiment, with large-scale investors seemingly preparing for SOL’s new highs. According to On-chain data firm Lookonchain, whales have been accumulating the cryptocurrency. The post highlights that an investor has bought millions of dollars in SOL tokens since October 22. On Sunday, the whale purchased another 7,500 SOL, around $1.57 million, raising its total holding to 257,599 SOL, worth around $56.6 million at the time of writing. SOL’s Pathway To $260 Following SOL’s breakout, some crypto analysts suggested that Solana is about to hit a new all-time high (ATH). Market watcher CryptoHornHair asserted that the token will soon enter price discovery mode like Bitcoin (BTC). BTC is leading the crypto market’s rally, registering a staggering 23% weekly surge and hitting a new ATH of $84,929 today. The analyst stated that Solana has “no resistance to be found on SOL above $216 until new ATHs.” Altcoin Sherpa also noted that Solana is near ATH territory, suggesting that the $260 target is around the corner. Similarly, Rekt Capital pointed out that the token is “technically well-positioned to repeat history with a move to $260 over time.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Blasts Through $82,000: These Are The Key Reasons The analyst considers SOL’s “momentous weekly close” and retests of the old $202 resistance as support has primed Solana for a surge to the ATH resistance levels. Per the post, the last time SOL performed a weekly close like this, it rallied to $260. At the time of writing, Solana is trading at $219.56, a 6% surge in the daily timeframe.

36169901,https://coinpaprika.com/news/alameda-sues-waves-founder-to-recover-90-million,1731407106,Alameda Sues Waves Founder to Recover $90 Million,"Alameda Research , a trading firm once affiliated with the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX, has filed a lawsuit against Aleksandr Ivanov, founder of the Waves blockchain platform, to reclaim approximately $90 million. This legal effort is part of Alameda's broader campaign to recover assets and repay creditors impacted by FTX's collapse in 2022. The complaint, filed on Sunday, accuses Ivanov and his associated companies, Numeris Ltd. and DLTech Ltd., of engaging in fraudulent practices that allegedly caused significant financial losses for Alameda. According to Alameda, it deposited around $80 million in stablecoins into Vires.Finance, a liquidity platform operating within the Waves ecosystem. However, Alameda claims that these funds are now trapped due to what it describes as Ivanov's mismanagement and deceptive activities . Alameda asserts that Ivanov conducted a series of transactions aimed at ""artificially inflating"" the value of the WAVES token, a cryptocurrency associated with the Waves platform. During this time, Ivanov allegedly diverted funds away from Vires, which ultimately led to a dramatic devaluation of the WAVES token. The complaint highlights that the token’s market value has plunged by over 95%, contributing to a $530 million loss for Vires users. Alameda claims that these manipulative actions were part of a strategy to prop up the value of WAVES temporarily, only to leave investors and users bearing the financial fallout when the token’s price collapsed. Furthermore, Alameda's lawsuit accuses Ivanov of attempting to manipulate public perception by attributing the Waves ecosystem's instability to Alameda. The firm alleges that while Ivanov publicly blamed Alameda for problems within the Waves network, he privately sought to extort funds from them. According to the complaint, Ivanov threatened to block Alameda’s access to their funds unless they provided financial support to stabilize the Waves and Vires platforms. When Alameda refused, Ivanov allegedly used his authority within the Vires decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to restrict Alameda’s access to their deposited assets. In November 2022, Ivanov publicly acknowledged that Alameda had placed approximately $90 million in stablecoins as collateral. However, he is reported to have taken steps to freeze these funds, stating that the freeze was intended to ensure repayment to FTX users affected by the collapse. Since then, Alameda claims that Ivanov has disregarded multiple attempts by the firm to negotiate a resolution or retrieve their assets, leaving their funds inaccessible. Alameda’s lawsuit not only seeks to recover the frozen assets but also requests compensation for damages related to alleged violations of the Bankruptcy Code, including fraud and conversion of property . The complaint outlines that Alameda is determined to pursue all possible avenues to retrieve any additional assets that Ivanov or his companies may have acquired through these activities. The firm also argues that Ivanov’s actions have further complicated efforts to reclaim assets, as he has reportedly taken steps to dissolve the legal entities that oversee both the Waves and Vires platforms. This move, according to Alameda, raises serious questions about the feasibility of recovering their funds and holding Ivanov accountable. The case represents one aspect of Alameda Research's broader initiative to reclaim assets for the benefit of creditors impacted by FTX's failure. The lawsuit indicates that Alameda is prepared to modify or expand its complaint as new information becomes available, leaving open the possibility of widening the scope of its legal action. Alameda's legal team has emphasized that it is committed to taking whatever steps are necessary to pursue the assets and secure compensation for the firm’s creditors. As the lawsuit unfolds, Ivanov has yet to make a public statement addressing these allegations. The case sheds light on the broader issue of asset recovery in the cryptocurrency industry, especially in cases where digital assets are tied up in decentralized platforms. The legal process could have implications for how similar cases are handled in the future, as it brings attention to the challenges associated with recovering assets in a decentralized finance (DeFi) environment. In filing this lawsuit, Alameda Research aims to set a precedent for accountability within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. By challenging the actions of prominent figures in the industry, Alameda’s case may encourage closer scrutiny of the operations of blockchain platforms like Waves. With rising interest in DeFi , cases like this highlight the need for transparency and legal clarity when handling large amounts of digital assets. The outcome of Alameda's lawsuit could influence future litigation involving asset recovery in the crypto world, potentially encouraging other companies to pursue similar claims if they believe they have been victims of fraud or mismanagement.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TRADING | RESEARCH,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/alameda-sues-waves-founder-to-recover-90-million,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36169901.jpeg

CryptoAmsterdam made the recommendation yesterday while updating their previous forecast for Shiba Inu, issued on September 30. At the time, the analyst indicated that ‘Stage 4’ was printed on the higher time frames of Shiba Inu’s chart, setting the stage for a potential upward trend. Following the printing of Stage 4 on the chart, CryptoAmsterdam said Shiba Inu formed a ‘mini-cycle structure,’ which propelled SHIB to a “macro range high.” Amid these developments, the chartist encouraged caution, urging investors to wait for two key signals. They include SHIB’s break above the corrective mini-range level of $0.25 or a false breakout that could confirm the authenticity of the move. Fresh Update Since CryptoAmsterdam issued the analysis on September 30, Shiba Inu has made some major moves, including surging to a 7-month high of $0.00003031. Hence, the analyst updated the analysis, emphasizing that SHIB has completed the mini-cycle formed as of November 30. According to CryptoAmsterdam, Shiba Inu recently completed the mini-cycle structure following its recent price increase. Interestingly, they expect Shiba Inu to continue its upward trend. However, the expert echoed that Shiba Inu's “dips are for buying,” suggesting that every short-term dip presents an opportunity to acquire more SHIB in anticipation of an imminent price surge. https://twitter.com/damskotrades/status/1856087025067405579Shiba Inu's Incredible Performance November, which Shiba Inu’s lead Shytoshi Kusama referred to as GrowVember, has been favorable to multiple crypto assets, including SHIB. Shiba Inu’s rally commenced in early November after the United States re-elected pro-crypto president Donald Trump. Notably, SHIB has surged 59% month-to-date (MTD), 65.4% in the past seven days, 64.5% in the past month, and 182.7% year-to-date (YTD). Shiba Inu, which surged to a 7-month high of $0.00003031 earlier today, is changing hands at $0.0000289. Following this remarkable performance, Shiba Inu now ranks among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap. It achieved the feat after flipping Avalanche (AVAX). Currently, Shiba Inu is the 10th biggest cryptocurrency, boasting a valuation of $17.09 billion. Given Shiba Inu’s rally, famous crypto expert Oscar Ramos projected that SHIB would soon reach a market cap of $100 billion. Notably, if the $100 billion projection becomes a reality, SHIB could trade at $0.0001697. In the meantime, investors must exercise caution when trading in the ongoing bull run, as massive volatility could arise in the coming days.",POSITIVE,AVAX | SHIB,AVAX | BUSINESS | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/12/analyst-recommends-buying-every-shiba-inu-dip-after-shib-made-this-move/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=analyst-recommends-buying-every-shiba-inu-dip-after-shib-made-this-move,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

While the country recently transferred $65 million worth of Bitcoin to Binance, it continues to mine more, following the trend of countries building national Bitcoin reserves. Bhutan joins El Salvador in growing its state-level Bitcoin stockpile, highlighting a rise in government-backed Bitcoin investments . Blockchain data from Arkham Intelligence reveals that Bhutan’s Bitcoin holdings have surpassed $1 billion, mainly due to the rising Bitcoin price. Bhutan began accumulating Bitcoin through mining in 2021 and has accelerated its efforts over the past year. This growth coincides with Bitcoin reaching record highs, enhancing the value of Bhutan’s existing stock rather than signaling a significant increase in the number of Bitcoins held. Two weeks ago, Bhutan moved around 900 BTC, worth approximately $65 million, to Binance. Although such a transfer often indicates a potential sell-off—similar to recent asset sales in Germany—Bhutan has maintained its mining pace and hasn’t sold off its holdings. Instead, it seems that this transfer may have been for financial positioning rather than a reduction in its stockpile. Bhutan’s approach reflects a broader trend of national Bitcoin holders. El Salvador, for example, has committed to retaining its substantial Bitcoin holdings regardless of price. In the U.S., Donald Trump has pledged to create a national Bitcoin reserve if elected, amplifying interest in government-held digital assets. This commitment suggests a growing confidence in Bitcoin as a state asset, a stance echoed by other countries but criticized by well-known Bitcoin skeptic Peter Schiff. Schiff recently commented on the potential impact of a hypothetical U.S. Bitcoin reserve, suggesting that if the U.S. were to acquire a million Bitcoins, it could drive up prices so much that long-term holders might finally cash out their investments. Although this scenario assumes multiple factors, it underscores the economic power large Bitcoin reserves could exert on the market. While Bhutan is a smaller player compared to the U.S., its status as a prominent Bitcoin holder and miner contributes to the trend of national-level Bitcoin accumulation. Unlike El Salvador or the hypothetical U.S. reserve, Bhutan has not hinted at intentions to influence market dynamics significantly. For now, it appears Bhutan’s strategy aligns with quietly building a Bitcoin reserve, positioning itself alongside a growing number of countries adopting Bitcoin as part of their financial portfolios.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | MINING | BNB | ARKM,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/bhutan-s-bitcoin-reserves-top-1-billion,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36168091.jpeg

Leading the list of candidates are Hester Peirce , Mark Uyeda, and Paul Atkins, all advocates for a less restrictive approach to digital assets. The next administration’s regulatory appointments are expected to significantly impact the future of cryptocurrency in the U.S. If selected, the new SEC chair and other agency leaders could ease regulations, supporting a friendlier environment for crypto innovations. Among the names under review are current regulators and former officials who have shown strong support for crypto. Former SEC Commissioner Daniel Gallagher , now a Robinhood board member, has openly criticized the SEC’s tight policies on digital assets, while Peirce and Uyeda have voiced similar objections to the current administration’s approach. One candidate, Peirce, is even being considered as an interim SEC chair, with the potential to lead a federal task force on cryptocurrency regulation. Another contender, Paul Atkins , is a former SEC commissioner who previously advised Trump and is known for his support of the crypto industry. Chris Giancarlo, who led the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) under Trump, is also under consideration and is known for his pro-crypto stance. The possible change in leadership comes after the SEC, under Gensler, aggressively pursued high-profile cases against major crypto companies like Binance, Coinbase, and Ripple, alleging securities law violations. These companies deny the accusations, claiming they operate lawfully and transparently. Trump previously expressed his intent to remove Gensler, suggesting a new direction for the agency. Trump’s election victory has already had an immediate impact on the crypto market. Optimism about potential regulatory changes has sparked one of the largest bull runs in years. Bitcoin ETFs, for instance, saw record inflows of $1.39 billion on November 7, the day after election results were confirmed. Additionally, three major crypto investors earned a total of $47 million in bets on Polymarket following the Republican win. Overall, Trump’s pro-crypto stance and planned regulatory appointments signal a potential easing of restrictions, potentially allowing banks more freedom to interact with the crypto industry.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/trump-eyes-pro-crypto-leaders-to-revamp-sec,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36167743.jpeg

36166884,https://coinpaprika.com/news/judge-denies-celsius-ceo-s-bid-to-dismiss-fraud-charges,1731402990,Judge Denies Celsius CEO’s Bid to Dismiss Fraud Charges,"A federal judge has refused former Celsius Network CEO Alex Mashinsky’s request to dismiss two critical fraud charges linked to manipulating the CEL token. Mashinsky, who is facing seven criminal charges in total, was accused of artificially inflating the value of CEL, Celsius's native cryptocurrency, through deceptive practices that allegedly misled investors and damaged the platform's credibility. The charges also involve accusations that he assured investors of the platform’s stability and security, despite knowing the risks. If convicted on all counts, he could face up to 115 years in prison. The November 8 ruling, delivered by U.S. District Judge John G. Koeltl, stated that Mashinsky's arguments for dismissal were “either moot or without merit,” allowing the case to continue. This ruling supports the prosecution’s approach, which contends that Mashinsky’s alleged actions violated both the Commodity Exchange Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Judge Koeltl noted that each charge could proceed independently, underscoring that a conviction under one law wouldn’t automatically negate or conflict with a conviction under the other. One focal point of Mashinsky's defense was the claim that the Celsius deposit program, which offered rewards for customer deposits of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, didn’t constitute a commodity contract as defined under U.S. law. Mashinsky’s attorneys from Mukasey Young LLP argued that the Commodity Exchange Act charge overlapped with violations under the Securities Exchange Act, but Judge Koeltl stated this matter could be resolved in the trial’s later stages. For now, each charge remains valid and will be examined on its own merits, solidifying the prosecution's case. Celsius Network was once among the largest and most influential crypto lending platforms, allowing users to earn interest on digital assets and access loans secured by their cryptocurrency holdings. However, the company faced a massive financial shortfall in 2022 due to a liquidity crisis and eventually declared bankruptcy after suspending customer withdrawals. The collapse of Celsius came amid a wave of instability across the crypto industry, following the downfall of the Terra Luna ecosystem and the failure of the UST stablecoin, both of which triggered severe repercussions across the market. The sudden withdrawals exposed the fragility of Celsius’s financial setup, leaving the company unable to fulfill its obligations to customers. Prosecutors allege that Mashinsky concealed critical information from investors, downplaying the risks associated with CEL while allegedly manipulating its market price. As per the allegations, Mashinsky reassured users of Celsius’s long-term safety and financial stability , leading many to continue investing and keeping assets on the platform. Prosecutors claim that Mashinsky’s actions caused significant harm to customers who believed in the platform’s advertised safety. Following his July 2023 arrest, the court froze Mashinsky’s assets, including his Texas home, marking a significant step in the case as he pleaded not guilty to all charges of fraud . The case against Mashinsky bears similarities to other high-profile crypto fraud cases, such as the recent conviction of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who was sentenced to 25 years for fraud and similar offenses. Bankman-Fried was found guilty of mismanaging customer funds, and his trial drew significant public attention. In a similar vein, Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of Alameda Research, an FTX affiliate, received a two-year sentence for her role in the FTX collapse. The outcomes of these cases emphasize the legal risks for crypto executives whose business practices fail to protect investors adequately. Mashinsky’s case will continue in court as he faces multiple criminal charges, including wire fraud, market manipulation, and securities fraud. The charges stem from his actions leading up to Celsius’s downfall and his alleged misrepresentation of Celsius’s financial health. Judge Koeltl’s recent ruling reinforces the legal standing of the prosecution’s case, clarifying that the Commodity Exchange Act and Securities Exchange Act charges can coexist, each reflecting different aspects of the alleged misconduct. This trial represents a major moment for regulatory oversight in the crypto industry, underscoring the increasing scrutiny of digital asset platforms that claim to offer security and returns while managing high-risk financial products. The allegations in Mashinsky’s case reflect broader concerns about transparency and accountability in the crypto sector, particularly as digital asset platforms navigate the challenges of regulatory compliance. Celsius’s rapid descent and bankruptcy sent shockwaves through the crypto industry and led many to question the integrity of lending platforms that promote high-yield returns while relying on volatile assets. Mashinsky’s case highlights the intense pressures and potential ethical compromises faced by leaders in the crypto space. The ruling by Judge Koeltl to allow the case to proceed suggests a clear judicial willingness to hold crypto executives accountable for misleading practices and to enforce compliance with financial regulations meant to protect investors and the integrity of financial markets.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | OTHER,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/judge-denies-celsius-ceo-s-bid-to-dismiss-fraud-charges,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36166884.jpeg

36179439,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=101181,1731402830,Here’s How Much 1 Dogecoin Will Be Worth If DOGE Market Cap Hits $100B,"Dogecoin could move close to setting a new all-time high (ATH) if its market cap surges to $100 billion amid the ongoing bull run. Dogecoin (DOGE) has remained one of the top gainers in the second phase of the bull run. Amid the recent rally, the dog-themed token has achieved jaw-dropping milestones, including hitting a 52-week high of $0.3032 and ranking as the sixth most valuable cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap. At the current price of $0.4048, Dogecoin is up 45.6% over the past 24 hours and 141.04% in the past seven days. Interestingly, Dogecoin’s market cap has also increased by 45.6% in the past day to $59.42 billion. DOGEUSDT 2024 11 12 07 59 37 Dogecoin Solidifies Its Dominance in Memecoin Market To put this into perspective, Dogecoin accounts for 52.92% of the total memecoin market cap of 112.28 billion, cementing its position as the number one meme-based cryptocurrency. Shiba Inu closely follows Dogecoin in the ranking with a market cap of $17.1 billion, representing 15.28% of the total memecoin valuation. Pepe and Dogwifhat are trailing SHIB, with their valuations worth $6.08 billion and $3.22 billion, respectively. Dogecoin Could Hit $100B Market Cap Soon Following Dogecoin’s impressive run in the past few days, there are speculations that the asset could hit a market cap of $100 billion in the 2024/2025 bull run. Specifically, market observer Jake Gagain predicted that Dogecoin would be the first memecoin to hit a $100 billion valuation. Hitting this valuation requires an increase of 68.29% from the current market cap of $59.42 billion. This could further solidify Dogecoin’s dominance in the memecoin market and potentially elevate the cryptocurrency to the fifth spot in the global crypto ranking, overtaking BNB (BNB), which currently has a valuation of $93.78 billion. Here’s Dogecoin's Price if it Hits a Market Cap of $100BAs the Dogecoin community anticipates DOGE’s surge to a $100 billion market cap, we analyzed how much a single DOGE could be worth if this projection materializes. First, we considered Dogecoin’s circulating supply, which currently stands at 146,757,136,384 (146.75 billion) DOGE. If Dogecoin hits the $100 billion market cap, DOGE will trade at $0.6813 per token, assuming its circulating supply remains stable. It is worth mentioning that the projected price of $0.6813 is still 7.63% below Dogecoin’s all-time high of $0.7376, registered on May 8, 2021. Meanwhile, the $0.68 target is close to other predictions issued by other crypto proponents. As reported in August, popular chartist Javon Marks projected that Dogecoin could surge to $0.6533 in the coming months, referencing key technical indicators like the asset’s Relative Strength Index (RSI). In the meantime, Dogecoin is still showing signs of upward momentum, with The Crypto Basic setting a potential target of $0.5408 based on Fibonacci projections.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB | BNB,DOGE | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/12/heres-how-much-1-dogecoin-will-be-worth-if-doge-market-cap-hits-100b/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heres-how-much-1-dogecoin-will-be-worth-if-doge-market-cap-hits-100b,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Bitcoin continued its upward trajectory on Tuesday, reaching a new high of over $89,000. This marks a significant increase from its $62,000 valuation just a month earlier.Notably, the world’s leading cryptocurrency has gained more than 40% in just a few weeks. Despite this impressive rally, Bitcoin’s growth still lags behind the average historical trajectory typically seen after halving events.Comparing Halving CyclesHistorically, Bitcoin’s halving cycles have triggered substantial price rallies. However, the current cycle has seen relatively modest gains so far.According to a recent report by CME Group, after the first halving in 2012, Bitcoin’s price surged by 8,447% within a year.The 2016 halving saw a 290% increase, pushing Bitcoin to nearly $20,000. More recently, after the 2020 halving, the cryptocurrency rallied by 559%, surpassing $60,000. However, post-2024 halving, Bitcoin has displayed lower upward movement that contrasts with the explosive growth observed in prior cycles.Bitcoin Could Reach $4.5M Price if History RepeatsDespite this, data from Ecoinometrics suggests the possibility of a significant future surge. Their analysis highlights a potential price range of $140,000 to $4.5 million. According to the analytic platform, if Bitcoin mirrors the trajectory of past cycles, it could enter six-figure territory within months, especially with sustained ETF inflows.https://twitter.com/ecoinometrics/status/1856006641327743371 Broader Market Trends and ComparisonWhile Bitcoin has experienced strong gains, it has not yet rallied in parallel with gold, which recently reached record highs, according to CME Group’s report.Gold’s rise has been driven by widespread central-bank buying and growing concerns over budget deficits in major economies. These deficits, coupled with loose monetary policies, have made fiat currencies less attractive to investors seeking safer, hard assets. CME Group suggests that similar forces could eventually favor Bitcoin. Historically, Bitcoin thrived during periods of low interest rates , gaining a first-mover advantage as the dominant digital asset. However, current interest rates remain above zero, and inflation levels are higher than pre-pandemic norms, potentially limiting central banks' ability to ease monetary policy further.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/12/experts-predict-bitcoin-could-hit-4-5m-if-history-repeats-fueled-by-consistent-etf-inflows/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=experts-predict-bitcoin-could-hit-4-5m-if-history-repeats-fueled-by-consistent-etf-inflows,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Price Appreciation For Leading Crypto Post-Election Market expert Jesse Olson recently shared his altcoin watchlist on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), highlighting four cryptocurrencies, including Solana (SOL), as key players for what could be massive gains ahead. Currently trading at around $218, SOL has experienced a significant 36% increase in price over the past week, outperforming many of the top ten cryptocurrencies. Remarkably, Solana is only 15% below its all-time high of $259, achieved in November 2021. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hits New All-Time High Of $84,000: What’s Next After A 23% Surge? The recent surge has resulted in a nearly 50% increase in trading volume over the weekend, allowing SOL to surpass Binance Coin (BNB) and secure the fourth position in terms of market capitalization among cryptocurrencies. Key resistance levels for Solana are set at $222 and $230, which could pose challenges for further upward movement. Another altcoin featured on Olson’s list is Ethereum (ETH). While it has underperformed compared to SOL and BTC in the weekly timeframe, ETH is approaching a critical breakout point. Currently trading at approximately $3,300, Ethereum is just 33% shy of its record high of $4,878, reached in November 2021. The recent surge of 1.7% in the last 24 hours suggests potential momentum as it seeks to break through four months of resistance at $3,320 Chainlink Struggles To Break Resistance As Cardano Shines Chainlink (LINK) has shown slightly different dynamics. Although it experienced a minor 1% decrease in the last 24 hours, LINK has posted a substantial 43% surge over the week, with a trading price of $14.70 as of Monday. Despite this positive weekly performance, LINK remains 72% below its all-time high of $52.70 recorded in May 2021. The token’s nearest resistance wall is at $14.80, a level it has not breached since July. Finally, Cardano (ADA) has emerged as a standout performer, boasting an impressive 84% surge in the weekly timeframe and an 80% increase over the past two weeks. Currently priced at $0.5959, ADA is still significantly below its all-time high of $3.09, reached in March 2020, and is down approximately 81%. The nearest resistance for ADA is positioned at $0.6115, and if it surpasses this level, it could pave the way for a return to its yearly high of $0.81.

Following an intraday pullback of 5.46%, a bearish candle has formed, signaling potential caution for the bulls. Aptos Price Chart Meanwhile, the ongoing bull run originated from a Morning Star pattern at the 200-day EMA, with the price rising from $7.73 to $14.11, reflecting an 82.54% increase.

However, as the broader market recovers, the APT price is likely to overcome this resistance and challenge the 100% Fibonacci level at $18.07.Aptos' 52-week high stands at $20.39, and the Fibonacci retracement tool suggests a potential target of $25.66. This implies that a new all-time high for Aptos in 2024 is within reach. Beyond that, the 1.618 Fibonacci extension at $40.07 indicates a possible upside of 190% if the price breaks out at $13.71.On the downside, the psychological support level at $10 is expected to hold as crucial support for Aptos.",POSITIVE,APT,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | APT,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/12/aptos-bull-run-eyes-13-71-breakout-for-190-upside-potential/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=aptos-bull-run-eyes-13-71-breakout-for-190-upside-potential,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Tether Pushes Another $2B into Crypto Market,"Leading stablecoin issuer Tether mints another $2 billion on the Ethereum network as fever pitch USDT demands emerge following the crypto market bullish outburst. The incessant demand for stablecoins in the crypto market has resumed following a broader market’s resurgence. The surging demand is evident in the over $765 billion added to the crypto market in the past week.With over 43% dominance, Tether’s USDT has been a crucial indicator of growing market demand. Blockchain analytic firm Lookonchain noted that the leading stablecoin issuer minted $2 billion on its Treasury two days ago, pushing them to exchanges amidst growing market demand.Meanwhile, Tether has minted another $2 billion on the Ethereum network, its third on the chain in less than a week. Whale Alert confirmed that the stablecoin issuer created the USDT on Ethereum late Monday.Notably, Lookonchain noted that Bitcoin surged to record highs following Tether’s $2 billion USDT mint two days ago. The fresh Monday mint has sparked speculation that the bullish event might further facilitate a Bitcoin uptrend.Authorized But Not Issued TransactionTether’s CEO Paolo Ardoino confirmed the $2 billion minting on the Ethereum network, noting it was an authorized but not issued transaction. He said the USDT minted is for inventory replenishment on the blockchain and will be used for the subsequent issuance request or chain swap.Notably, USDT demand has accelerated on the Ethereum network recently. Tether has now minted $5 billion USDT on Ethereum in less than a week, as on-chain stablecoin transactions on the chain surge amidst a blossoming crypto market.Meanwhile, circulating USDT on the Ethereum network has reached $60 billion, with more than half of the minted USDT on Monday already in circulation. However, the Tron network remains Tether’s largest USDT holder, with $61.8 billion in authorized Tether’s stablecoin.Tether’s Chain Swap Still In PlayNotably, Tether has continued its chain swap activities, moving multi-million dollars worth of USDT across exchanges. The stablecoin issuer announced on November 6 that it would resume the shuffle in partnership with major centralized exchanges.Whale Alert pointed to several transactions in which top-tier exchanges moved millions of USDT to Tether’s Treasury and a reverse scenario. Notably, Ardoino confirmed all the transactions were part of the issuer’s chain swap activities.For context, Binance moved $700 million USDT to the Tether Treasury on Monday. Two hours later, Whale Alert confirmed that Tether transferred $560 million back to the largest crypto exchange by trading volume.A similar transaction was seen between Tether and Bitfinex and other unidentified wallets. Notably, Tether noted the chain-swapped USDT was moved to the Ethereum network.Meanwhile, Tether now has $124 billion USDT in circulation. Tether’s trading volume has also surged 31% in the past 24 hours to $250 billion, more than double its circulating supply.",POSITIVE,USDT,ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/12/more-upside-tether-pushes-2b-into-the-crypto-market/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=more-upside-tether-pushes-2b-into-the-crypto-market,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

36162261,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652581,1731396626,Ethereum Could Be Set To Explore New Highs As On-Chain Metrics Light Up,"On-chain data shows metrics related to network activity have spiked for Ethereum recently, something that could pave way for a further rally. Ethereum Transaction Volume & Whale Transfer Count Have Spiked Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, Ethereum has seen an uplift in two activity-related metrics. The indicators in question are the Transaction Volume and the Whale Transaction Count. The first of these, the “Transaction Volume,” keeps track of the total amount of the cryptocurrency (in USD) that users on the ETH network are shifting across the network with their transactions. Related Reading: Dogecoin To As High As $23? This Pattern Could Hint So When the value of this metric is high, it means the ETH blockchain is processing the transfer of a large number of coins right now. Such a trend suggests the investors actively invest in asset trading. On the other hand, the low indicator implies the interest in the cryptocurrency may currently be low as the holders are only moving around a low amount of ETH. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Transaction Volume for Ethereum over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum Transaction Volume has registered a sharp surge recently, implying interest in the asset has increased alongside the price rally. This could be considered a constructive development for the cryptocurrency, as an increasing network activity is generally required for rallies to be sustainable. In the past, some price moves have kicked off sharply, but the Transaction Volume didn’t register much of an increase at the same time. Such moves generally died out before long. The chart also contains the data for the other metric of relevance here, the “Whale Transaction Count.” This indicator measures the total amount of ETH transfers valued at more than $100,000. Transactions of this scale are assumed to be coming from the whale entities, so the Whale Transaction Count reflects the activity level of the big-money investors. From the graph, it’s apparent that this indicator has also spiked for Ethereum recently, which implies that the recent increase in the volume isn’t just a sign of interest from the smaller investors but also the humongous hands. Naturally, it’s impossible to say based off these indicators alone, whether the investors are buying or selling, as all types of transactions look the same from their view. Because ETH has seen a sharp rally recently, this activity has probably been for accumulation so far. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holder Profits Now 121%: How Much Higher Can BTC Go?

The jump led to crypto traders losing over $68 million on DOGE-tracked futures.  Dogecoin {{DOGE}} continued its strong rally for the fourth-straight day with a 48% price jump over the past 24 hours, reigniting murmurs of a $1 price target.  DOGE jumped above the 41 cents mark early Tuesday for the first time since May 2021, when it set a record high of just over 70 cents. It has returned over 150% to investors in the past week and nearly tripled over the past 30 days, data shows.  DOGE-tracked futures saw over $68 million in cumulative losses. Those liquidations were the largest for the dog-themed token so far this year, with open interest nearing a lifetime record from April.  Much of the current rally has been fueled by bullish sentiment around the meme’s endorsement by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk in the Trump administration.  Musk has discussed creating a “Department of Government Efficiency,” abbreviated as D.O.G.E, to make government spending more efficient. That has fueled expectation among traders that there could be more chatter of “DOGE” in mainstream media and retail trading circles, fueling attention and interest in dogecoin, as a CoinDesk analysis first noted in mid-October.  Recent price action has led some crypto traders to mark $1 as a major price target for DOGE — one that has been long anticipated since 2021, when the token traded above 70 cents.  The $1 mark has a psychological appeal, spurring “doge to $1” memes in the past several years.",POSITIVE,DOGE,BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/12/dogecoin-rockets-48-as-traders-target-1-price-next,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2cacb0c1dfdaf66121a3b8cab804bf91f5ed1512-720x405.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42415536,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOJulf,1731391862,Fairshake Notches Another Win With Arizona's Ruben Gallego; 16 House Seats Still Uncalled,"Democrat Ruben Gallego won the Arizona Senate seat defeating Republican Kari Lake. While Democrats lost control of the Senate in the 2024 election, Gallego's win stemmed some of the losses.  Republicans will control 53 seats for at least the next two years, having flipped Pennsylvania, Ohio, Montana and West Virginia last week. The crypto-focused super political action committee, Fairshake, was heavily involved in the Ohio race in particular, supporting Republican Bernie Moreno to the tune of $40 million.  Gallego, a congressman from the Grand Canyon State, voted in favor of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act and a resolution overturning the Securities and Exchange Commission's Staff Accounting Bulletin 121. Fairshake gave him $10 million in support, as well as fellow Democrat Elissa Slotkin, who won Michigan's Senate race. Both prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi, as well as polling, projected he would win the race.  The House of Representatives still has 16 races left to call, as of 05:30 UTC Tuesday (12:30 ET). Republicans have already won 214, leaving them just four seats shy of the majority for another Congressional term. Democrats have won 205 seats so far, and Republicans are still favored to win control of the body. With the Senate and Donald Trump's win in the presidential race, Republicans are poised to have control of a unified government.  Fairshake supported 56 candidates in the House and Senate races, largely in primaries in safe districts, meaning ones where the primarywinner would likely win their general election race as well. California's Senate race, where Fairshake dropped millions in opposition to Democrat Katie Porter, is one such example. Through last Friday, this theory was largely borne out, as the PAC's preferred candidates won the first 48 of those races to be called.  As of press time, this record appears to be slipping a little bit, with Democrat Yadira Caraveo and Republican Mike Garcia both conceding their races – though AP has yet to call either. Democrat Mary Peltola and Republican Lori Chavez-DeRemer are also trailing, though Republicans Michelle Steel, David Valadao and Juan Ciscomani are currently leading against their opponents.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/11/12/fairshake-notches-another-win-with-arizonas-ruben-gallego-16-house-seats-still-uncalled,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eb498510124d182b45a5b34fb337b7c511ea6797-3200x1800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This volatility was the highest since BTC briefly surpassed $73,000 earlier in the year.  Altcoins like DOGE, SOL, and APT also saw substantial futures losses, with DOGE experiencing its largest liquidations this year.  DOGE gained over 40%, beating the 24-hour gains for the top 100 tokens.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} briefly surged above $89,000 in early Asian hours, before correcting to as low as $87,000, in a wild trading session that saw the asset extend 7-day gains to over 32%.  The volatility caused nearly $700 million in liquidations on crypto-tracked futures, impacting both longs and shorts (or bets on higher and lower prices, respectively), with $380 million in bearish traders and $290 million in bullish bets evaporated. Such cumulative losses are the highest since early April, when BTC briefly crossed its previous peak at over $73,000.  Dogecoin {{DOGE}} was another shining spot in the crypto market, gaining over 40% to near 41 cents as the market celebrated Dogecoin-supporter Elon Musk's proximity to President-elect Donald Trump.  BTC-tracked futures recorded over $200 million in short liquidations, followed by $40 million on bearish ether trades.  Futures of other majors and midcaps, from Solana’s SOL to Aptos (APT) saw over $25 million in losses each — with unusually large figures implying a swift return to riskier bets among crypto traders. These futures typically see liquidations under $5 million in general market conditions.  Annualized funding rates have spiked to over 30% across some altcoin-tracked futures, Coinglass data shows.  BTC zoomed more than 7% in the past 24 hours following an unusually bullish weekend, carrying over sentiment for higher prices after Republican Donald Trump's win at the U.S. presidential elections last week.  A Republican sweep could see total crypto market cap grow to $10 trillion by the end of 2026 from the current $3 trillion mark, bank analysts say, with price targets of $100,000 by the end of this year.  Traders warn of a price correction in the short term, however, with a risk of a leverage washout above the $90,000 level and predictions of a slower ascent from current levels to $100,000.

36158339,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652640,1731391216,"Bitcoin Buying Pressure Rises, But Here’s Why A Pullback Could Be Coming","A recent analysis from BaroVirtual, a CryptoQuant analyst, offers a nuanced perspective on the current state of the Bitcoin market. According to the analyst, fluctuations in the Coinbase premium—a key metric that tracks the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase and other exchanges—can offer significant insights. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs See Historic Surge – Institutions Go Bullish On BTC With $1.38 Billion Record Inflows Retail Leverage And Premiums: A Double-Edged Sword Rising or elevated Coinbase premiums typically suggest intense buying pressure, indicating strong medium-term sentiment for Bitcoin. However, BaroVirtual warns that in the short term, these high premiums may present a double-edged sword, as they often precede a localized downward movement in Bitcoin’s price. This phenomenon stems from market dynamics, as high premiums reflect surges in demand that can lead to overheating. When this occurs in combination with a high volume of leveraged retail positions and an excessive number of long contracts, the risk of a market pullback increases. Notably, BaroVirtual pointed out that this scenario has been evident in some Asian exchanges, where traders’ aggressive positions and leveraged setups further amplified market vulnerabilities. The analyst’s observations extend beyond the Coinbase premium to the broader market context. When premiums soar, they signal strong demand and positive sentiment among investors. This can provide a floor for Bitcoin’s price, strengthening support levels and creating a bullish sentiment over the medium term. However, in the short run, the influx of highly leveraged retail positions can destabilize market balance, leading to sharp corrections. High leverage implies that even minor price swings can force liquidations, exacerbating downward price movements. The CryptoQuant analyst emphasized leverage dynamics’ major role in determining bullish trends’ sustainability. Retail traders’ aggressive positioning on some Asian exchanges reflects a growing risk appetite, which may lead to sudden market shifts if sentiment turns or if premiums dip. Bitcoin Nears $100,000 After previously trading just above $83,000 earlier today, Bitcoin’s price has now pushed further. So far, BTC has achieved a latest all-time high of (ATH) of $84,929 less than an hour ago. However, the asset has seen a slight correction with a current trading price of $84,929, at the time of writing. Regardless of this slight pullback, with the current bullish momentum in Bitcoin, it is evident that the asset could continue this rally and rise above $85,000 soon, bringing it closer to a six digit ATH of $100,000 and beyond.

Elevated perpetual funding rates and basis yields suggest potential leverage washouts ahead.  As bitcoin {{BTC}} prices approach the $90,000 mark, a sense of euphoria or extreme optimism seems to be sweeping through the market, warning of a potential price pullback ahead.  That's the latest analysis from Singapore-based crypto trading firm QCP Capital.  ""With BTC's break of key resistance and it's multi-month range, the market is certainly in a state of euphoria. Perp funding is very elevated and basis yields are at seven-month highs,"" QCP Capital said in a Telegram broadcast.  ""While we remain structurally bullish, we are cautious of any pullbacks, especially from leveraged washouts,"" the trading firm added.  The open interest-weighted funding rates in perpetuals or futures with no expiry have surged to 0.056%, the highest since at least March, according to Coinglass.  It's a sign that bullish long positions are likely getting crowded, and a slight price pullback could see over leveraged bulls capitulate, closing their longs and inadvertently exacerbating downside pressures in the market. Leverage washouts have been a common phenomenon in previous bull markets, often leading to a sudden double-digit percentage price drops.  An elevated funding rate means perpetual futures are trading at a premium to the spot price. Standard futures contracts are also trading at an annualized premium (basis) of over 15% across all exchanges, including the CME.  The premium represents the return available on the market-neutral cash and carry arbitrage strategy that involves buying the asset in the spot market while simultaneously selling a futures contract.  Per QCP Capital, historically such sharp spikes in the so-called basis yields have not lasted very long.  BTC changed hands at $88,300 at press time, representing a nearly 30% gain in seven days, according to CoinDesk data. Prices hit a high of $89,622 during the overnight trade.  The price surge since Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. election held on Nov. 5 has sparked a strong belief among traders that this upward trend will continue unabated.

The price tested the $0.6330 zone and is currently correcting gains. XRP price is struggling to gain pace like Bitcoin. The price is now trading above $0.5980 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.5940 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it stays above the $0.5700 support zone. XRP Price Holds Support XRP price remained supported above the $0.5550 level. It formed a base and started a fresh increase above $0.5800, but gains were limited compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move above the $0.6150 and $0.62200 resistance levels. The bulls even pushed the price above the $0.6300 level before the bears appeared. A high was formed at $0.6336 before there was a pullback. The price dipped below $0.6220 and tested $0.6150. It tested the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.5709 swing low to the $0.6336 high. The price is now trading above $0.5980 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.5940 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The trend line is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.5709 swing low to the $0.6336 high. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.6150 level. The first major resistance is near the $0.6220 level. The next key resistance could be $0.6350. A clear move above the $0.6350 resistance might send the price toward the $0.6465 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.6550 resistance or even $0.6720 in the near term. The next major hurdle might be $0.6880. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $0.6150 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5980 level. The next major support is near the $0.5940 level and the trend line. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5940 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.5700 support in the near term. The next major support sits near the $0.5550 zone.

36150343,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652617,1731380448,Is Bitcoin Now Overheating? Key Metrics Reveal Crucial Insights For Investors,"Amid Bitcoin’s pursuit to hit the six figures all-time high (ATH), a CryptoQuant analyst known as aytekin, has shared a comprehensive analysis on tools to assess Bitcoin’s market temperature, focusing on distinguishing useful from potentially misleading metrics. According to aytekin, investors’ concerns often center around Bitcoin’s ability to reach new peaks and when it might experience a market top. To navigate these questions, he highlighted two charts he pays less attention to for gauging market sentiment: “open interest” and the “supply in profit” metric. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals Bitcoin Key Support Levels For Reaccumulation – Details Challenges With BTC Key Metrics The analyst elaborated that establishing a causal link between price and open interest remains challenging, as historical data indicates that price fluctuations tend to drive changes in open interest levels rather than the reverse. Furthermore, the analyst reveals that with the growth of futures markets and Bitcoin’s adoption, higher levels of open interest are anticipated in the coming years. Another metric aytekin views as potentially misleading is the “supply in profit,” which measures overall network profitability. This metric correlates with Bitcoin’s nominal price, often leading to extreme spikes above 95% in profitability during ATH periods. However, aytekin suggests that reaching new highs would be problematic if extreme profitability consistently triggered major sell-offs. Instead, he recommends considering how long these high-profitability levels persist, noting that historically, such conditions have lasted up to a year within broader market cycles. Credible Metric Suggests Overheating Bitcoin? In contrast, the analyst emphasized two metrics he finds valuable for tracking Bitcoin’s market sentiment: the funding rate and the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR). The funding rate, which tracks the cost paid between long and short positions in futures markets, serves as a tool to identify “overzealous” market optimism. Aytekin believes monitoring this metric offers better insights than open interest for assessing market conditions. As of now, he notes that funding rates are not signaling extreme market behavior. The analyst reveals that the SOPR metric clarifies profitability trends, particularly when smoothed using a 30-day moving average. Aytekin highlights that profitability alone is not inherently risky unless it coincides with supply movements within the market. The CryptoQuant analyst reveals that current SOPR levels indicate a market that, while showing signs of profitability, does not exhibit symptoms of overheating.

Data Hints At Massive 60,000% Rally","Many analysts are anticipating a bull run for Ripple’s XRP which could lead to an exponential growth, giving Ethereum and Bitcoin a run for their money. Several experts suggest that XRP’s potential price rally could be attributed to Donald Trump winning the US election, a political event that brought so much excitement to the cryptocurrency sector. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Strategic US Hub Plan Sends SHIB Price On A 23% Moonshot XRP: 700% Price Hike Analysts said that XRP could be on the brink of a possible price rally based on historical price movement after an election. They predicted that the price could skyrocket by 700% to about $4.89 per coin if history repeats itself. Currently, the crypto is being traded at $0.6113 with a total market capitalization of $34.76 billion and a 24-hour volume of $2.82 billion. Market commentators said that they believed that XRP would greatly benefit from positive sentiment brought by the upcoming administration of pro-crypto Donald Trump. According to analysts, they see a potentially massive price surge for the digital currency because of the long-term pattern in its price movement and a possible repetition of the coin’s post-election trends. However, some market observers decided not to disclose any price target for the anticipated XRP upsurge. Meanwhile, other analysts suggested that the most optimistic forecast for a post-election surge would be a growth between 100% and 500%, saying that the XRP price would be somewhere between $1.22 to $3.67 per coin. Historical Price Rally Analysts studied the price movement of XRP in past US elections, saying that after the 2016 US election, the digital asset’s price went down in the next four months after the election poll. They however noted that after the initial price dip, the altcoin had a massive price rally which propelled the coin to a whopping 60,000% and hit the all-time high of $3.31, an event which is not far-fetched at the moment. If XRP would again surge by 60,000% after the election, it would reach the $367 level. $XRP huge acceleration is coming Look at the past elections and see what follows. pic.twitter.com/ufcqC8v5Y5 — Mikybull 🐂Crypto (@MikybullCrypto) November 8, 2024 Likewise, in the 2020 election, XRP also experienced a huge price uptick of 177%, coincidentally in the same month as in the 2016 breakout before a correction was done in December.

42415541,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOJuoB,1731373200,Decentralized Social Media Firm Lens Eyes Massive Scale-Up,"Lens is attempting to reach scale by addressing the drawbacks of social media platforms managed by big centralized companies like Facebook and Elon Musk's X (formerly Twitter).  The latest version introduces application building blocks that allow users to create decentralized newspapers with thousands of contributors.  Given the power large social media firms wield these days, not to mention worries around AI-driven bias, the time is ripe for decentralized alternatives like Lens to jump into the spotlight. Lens, a blockchain-based approach to information sharing, released its latest version which strengthens the platform’s endlessly customizable and collaborative potential.  Lens, which was founded in 2022 by the creators of decentralized finance (DeFi) giant Aave, released its version 3 on Monday, having already empowered some 550,000 users by granting them complete ownership of their social identity, the data they create, the connections they make and the audiences they communicate with.  Lens is one of several blockchain-oriented, or “Web3,” startups attempting to reach scale by addressing what are seen as the drawbacks of social-media platforms managed by big centralized companies such as Facebook and Elon Musk's X (formerly Twitter).  X owner Musk’s now close alignment with the incipient government of Donald Trump could make this a good time to court a proportion of Americans with social media alternatives such as Lens.  Lens founder Stani Kulechov said he expects to see “some increased activity, for sure” in the wake of the U.S. election. “But the true spikes will come on the application layer as we see more and more applications being built on this technology,” Kulechov said in an interview.  Lens employs DeFi’s concept of composability, the use of Lego-like building blocks to add features and plug into other applications within the blockchain space.  With the latest version, Lens introduces a couple of flagship features in the form of information feeds and curated content groups. The way feeds can be developed within Lens, means users have the ability to create what are essentially decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), Kulechov said, that could range from newsletters to entire newspapers with thousands of contributors.  The platform’s foundational on-chain identity and verification flexibility means a rising tide of AI-driven bias can be kept in check.  “The election showed that people consume algorithms that are pretty much pushed at them and there's very little user choice. Whether it's with feeds or some other type of solution, users should be able to choose their algorithm, and be able to shop around and change it knowingly,” Kulechov said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/11/12/decentralized-social-media-firm-lens-eyes-massive-scale-up,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9308f599f966cfafa038bfd44fbfb182006b6aba-1441x940.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Public company holdings of BTC are up 34% year to date, with MicroStrategy making up the overwhelming majority of that increase. Popular cycle top indicators like MVRV Ratio, Puell Multiple, and the Stock-to-Flow Model show considerable room to run still if history is any guide. As of article submission, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has printed a fresh all time high of $87,000 per coin. Having rallied nearly 30% in a matter of just a few days, a $100,000 per coin Bitcoin price seems as though it's only a 'matter of when' rather than a 'matter of if' at this point in time: BTC Weekly Chart, 11/11/24 (TrendSpider) The chart setup for BTC looks terrific for bulls. In recent pieces for Seeking Alpha, I've covered Bitcoin from a variety of different angles; including on-chain metrics, seasonality, technical conditions, and election impact: BITO: Buying The 'Breakout Shakeout' BITW: The 'Trump Trade' At A Discount From low to high, BTC has added $20k per coin in just 7 days . Given the absolute surge in the price of the coin since my last two Bitcoin-related articles, I wanted to add some additional coverage for readers to consider. In this piece, we'll explore recent capital flows, possible cycle top indicators to be mindful of, and a reiteration of why I personally like the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ETF ( FBTC ) as my preferred ETF for long term allocations. Capital Flows and Corporate Holdings During the monstrous BTC rally earlier this year that took Bitcoin on a 90% ride between late-January and mid-March, the aggregated on-chain holdings of the US-based spot products increased from 635k BTC to roughly 830k BTC before holdings growth stalled out for several months. US Spot ETF Holdings (TheBlock) We again see on-chain holdings in these funds starting to quickly rise once again. As of November 10th, these funds hold 1.05 million BTC on behalf of investors; indicating a sharp 10% increase in supply held through spot ETFs since the end of September. Per data from CoinShares, the week ended November 8th was the 5th consecutive week of positive inflow for crypto-related investment products globally. From a raw figure standpoint, the crypto market has seen nearly $2 billion of net inflow since the election of President Trump on November 5th. There has been a staggering $1.8 billion of investment demand for BTC alone in a single week: Asset Flows (CoinShares) Year to date, net flows for Bitcoin through traditional investment products have now surpassed $29 billion. ETFs and other investment funds aren't the only buyers. We've seen public and private companies execute corporate treasury management strategies that include Bitcoin in recent years. Interestingly, the year to date holdings data is a bit more mixed: BTC Holdings 12/31/23 11/10/24 YTD Private Companies 479,361 410,401 -14.4% Public Companies 272,103 363,629 33.6% Public & Private Combined 751,464 774,030 3.0% Source: Bitcoin Treasuries While public companies have grown BTC holdings by 33.6% year to date, private companies have actually been net sellers of BTC since the end of 2023. In fact, when we strip out the BTC holdings of MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) from the rest of the public company holdings, we see a far less enthusiastic story for even the public companies: BTC Holdings 12/31/23 11/10/24 YTD Public Companies 272,103 363,629 33.6% MicroStrategy 189,150 279,420 47.7% Public minus MSTR 82,953 84,209 1.5% Source: Bitcoin Treasuries Taking out MicroStrategy's BTC holdings from total public holdings results in just a 1.5% year to date increase in BTC held via public companies. This is certainly a trend that I suspect long term Bitcoiners will want to keep an eye on going forward, as it likely conflicts with the notion that we're seeing more adoption of Bitcoin as a corporate treasury strategy. Cycle Indicators In my October article covering the iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), I shared several cycle indicators that, I felt, were worth considering such as HODLer balance and realized HODLer price. In this update, I'd like to share a few additional metrics that, I think, can be helpful for assessing when a cycle peak may be in. First, the MVRV Ratio: MVRV Ratio (IntoTheBlock) This is the market value to realized value, or the average purchase cost of each coin. During past cycle peaks, we've seen the MVRV ratio approach or even eclipse the 400% level. The ratio hit 435% in December 2017 and 373% in 2021. As of November 10th, the MVRV checks in at 239%. Even if we assume a law of diminishing returns and project just a 300% MVRV ratio top for this cycle, the ratio would be projecting a $135k per coin BTC price at current realized price levels. How does this compare with other models? Puell Multiple (Bitcoin Magazine PRO) The chart above is showing Bitcoin's Puell Multiple in orange. This figure takes the dollar-denominated revenue that is being earned by Bitcoin miners and compares it with statistical averages. The higher the multiple, the more extreme the price dislocation from norms. At Bitcoin's 2017 peak, the Puell Multiple eclipsed 6. Prior to peaking in 2021, the multiple nearly took out 4. As of November 10th, the Puell Multiple was slightly above 1. Again assuming diminishing returns over time, even if the multiple gets to just 2 again, it would be implying a BTC value closer to $174k per coin. Stock-To-Flow (Bitcoin Magazine PRO) I am not personally a fan of the stock-to-flow model for Bitcoin, but I'd rather show it and comment than ignore it when talking about cycle top price possibilities because I know there are many who do follow it. The biggest reason I don't generally care for this model is because the coin has been well behind the model for most of the last 3 years. If BTC were to ""catch up"" with the stock-to-flow model, it would imply a price today of $135k BTC and a price of $420k by May. I flat out don't believe that we'll see Bitcoin at $420k anytime soon, and certainly not in the next 6 to 7 months. Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund Data by YCharts Buying Bitcoin through the ETF products is going to lead to long term under-performance due to the expense ratio. Compared with other funds like IBIT, FBTC is competitive, judging by the very similar total return since fund inception. But there is one critical difference between these funds that I think tilts the scale in favor of FBTC. I've written previously about the specific reasons why I like FBTC versus other spot Bitcoin ETFs in the past. To reiterate, the biggest reason; the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF does not use Coinbase ( COIN ) as the fund's custodian. I have no issue with Coinbase. I've used it in the past as a customer. As a retail trader, COIN's fees are quite a bit more than I'd want them to be when compared with the spot ETFs. Even in a standard brokerage account, the 25 bps charged by the fund is far cheaper than what a retail trader would generally pay to buy Bitcoin from Coinbase and self-custody the asset. I've done that math in a prior article , and it still checks out. Monthly Exchange Volume (TheBlock) In my view, the relative value offered by the spot ETFs is a big reason why active addresses have been in decline and monthly exchange volume remains well off highs. My longer-term suspicion is that Coinbase will raise custody fees on ETF managers. Since Fidelity self-custodies the Bitcoin held via FBTC, this long-term Coinbase fee risk is diminished. Thus, my spot ETF preference for long-term Bitcoin allocation is FBTC. Thesis Risks The major risk to the FBTC long thesis would be if the price of Bitcoin doesn't continue to rise with global liquidity. There are theoretical scenarios where the price of BTC falls even as global liquidity rises - such was the case for most of the summer during 2024. Prior to the approval of spot ETFs, Bitcoin has historically benefited from a parabolic phase when there has been clear signs of FOMO from retail traders and investors. I don't know that we can conclusively say we have that: Bitcoin purchase interest (Google Trends) Google Trends Search interest for ""how to buy bitcoin"" hasn't sniffed extremes that we've seen in the past. Though, we can observe a noticeable move higher at the beginning of November. There is perhaps credence to the notion that retail traders already know how to buy Bitcoin, since there were Super Bowl advertisements for cryptocurrency exchanges during the last cycle and spot ETFs exist. But a more fundamental risk is the lack of on-chain active addresses recently would be indicative of a network that is not really functioning as originally intended. Furthermore, a manufactured supply crunch through HODLing an asset isn't necessarily a great reason to be bullish, in my view. Investor Takeaways Despite my skepticism about $420k BTC, or even $200k BTC for that matter, I do think the market is going to take the Bitcoin price to six figures and possibly as high as $135-140k. Where the coin goes from there is anybody's guess. I still think there are a lot of reasons to be cautious about blindly HODLing any coin or token, and BTC is no different. Actual users of Bitcoin have been in decline and scalability continues to be a concern, judging by things like Lightning Network channels. Bitcoin is supposed to be a network for 'the people' not a speculative asset for Wall Street. But we have to trade the reality we have, not the reality we might want. Narratives can be very powerful and few narratives have had the same stickiness as Bitcoin's 'digital gold' narrative over the last decade. There will be a time to be bearish BTC, but we're not there yet.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4736166-fbtc-my-preferred-vessel-for-the-ride-to-100k-plus-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36143137.jpeg

36142264,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652588,1731369648,"Solana Market Cap Surpasses $100 Billion, Setting Up SOL For Potential ATH Rally","Solana (SOL) recently saw its market cap surge past $100 billion, setting the stage for a potential all-time high (ATH) rally for its native SOL token. Solana Reclaims $100 Billion Market Cap, Is SOL ATH Imminent? Solana, currently the cryptocurrency with the fourth-largest market cap, recently joined the ranks of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Tether (USDT) by surpassing the $100 billion mark in market valuation. Related Reading: Solana Breaks Above Key Resistance – Top Analyst Sets $300 Target At the time of writing, Solana’s native token SOL is trading at $216.43, marking impressive weekly gains of 32.6%. In comparison, Bitcoin has gained 19.6% and Ethereum 29.7% over the same period. To recall, SOL’s current ATH of $259.96 was recorded in November 2021, at the peak of the crypto bull market, buoyed by monetary easing as a measure to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. However, this upward momentum changed sharply for SOL at the height of the FTX crisis, with its price plummeting to a low of $8.68 in November 2022. SOL’s current market price thus reflects an almost 40x increase from these lows. Despite this substantial recovery, analysts believe there is still more room for SOL to rally, potentially setting a new ATH in its current price surge. Providing commentary on SOL’s recent price action, Julien Bittel, Head of Macro Research at Global Macro Investor, shared his analysis, saying that the SOL/BTC trading pair has broken out of an 8-month sideways consolidation channel, potentially moving toward the “banana zone” in Q4 2024. For the uninitiated, the “banana zone” in trading terms refers to a phase where the underlying asset may witness an explosive, parabolic price appreciation, leading to extraordinary gains in a short period. This breakout has positioned SOL for either an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on the daily chart or a cup-and-handle pattern on the weekly chart, both incredibly bullish patterns for the altcoin. Another crypto trader, Bob Loukas, shared his outlook on X, stating that he wouldn’t be surprised to see SOL reaching a new ATH “within 14 days.” Loukas hinted that SOL could “get silly” in 2025, suggesting the potential for abnormal gains shortly. Overall Sentiment Bullish On SOL As BTC continues establishing new ATHs beyond $80,000, the wider crypto market appears to follow the leading asset’s price momentum. Related Reading: Solana ‘Must Break Descending Resistance’ To Regain Bullish Momentum – Analyst Among major altcoins, SOL has piqued the interest of several crypto analysts due to its potential to “flip” Ethereum’s market cap and become the leading smart contract platform. In related news, Solana’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem’s total-value-locked (TVL) rose to $5.7 billion during Q3 2024, signifying a 26% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) growth. Some analysts are wary of SOL’s current price action, suggesting that the token might be headed for a sharp correction before further upside movement. BTC trades at $82,251 at press time, up 3.5% in the past 24 hours.
