According to a YouTuber, further proliferation of the digital asset will cause a steady rise of BTC to a million dollars. On a YouTube video, InvestAnswers signaled that BTC is approaching diminishing returns. Diminishing return is when an asset gets to a point where increased future investment yields less profit. The crypto analyst said that BTC yields investors five times less profit every new market cycle in comparison to the previous one.

They cited that the value of networks grows as the number of participants increases, according to Metcalfe&apos;s law. If Bitcoin follows the trend of disruptive networks like cellphones and the internet, applying Metcalfe&apos;s law projects a bullish case scenario for bitcoin.

42411351,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNI2n,1664318613,Ranking Blockchain Universities Is Answering the Wrong Question,"""Where did you go to university"" used to be one of the first questions a prospective employer would ask an aspiring job candidate. From first-hand experience as an employer in crypto I can tell you this is not something I, or most companies in the space, care about.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Education Week  The same is true for venture capitalists who say they no longer care about the educational pedigree of founders, nor where they are based. The world has changed a lot since it was considered a requirement to move to Silicon Valley with an Ivy league degree to build a scalable tech company.  Why would crypto employers not care about something that has been so fundamental to career progression throughout the past century? As someone who has a long history in higher academics, I am comfortable stating that, generally speaking, our global education system from grade school through Ph.D. programs has become so woefully outdated that where you went to school, or didn’t, is a terrible predictor of future success in the industries of today and tomorrow.  We started witnessing the decoupling of formal education credentials from entrepreneurial success during the dot-com era. Steve Jobs of Apple, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Spotify founder Daniel Ek and Twitter's Jack Dorsey are just a few famous college dropouts who went on to found some of the most influential companies of their generation.  It seems, however, that the pace of innovation in emerging industries like crypto is just warp-speed faster than our educational systems can keep up with. In January 2017, the total market cap of crypto was less than $20 billion and, despite going through our second bear market, it is still worth more than $1 trillion today. Very few of the top 10 tokens from 2017 would make the top 100 today.  In those five years or so we have seen the rise and drastic fall of initial coin offerings, the emergence and explosion of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFT), a surge in the use of crypto for the metaverse, gaming and play-to-earn, the introduction of several alternative layer 1 base blockchains and layer 2 companion systems and much more.  On top of that, the very same tools the dot-com boom brought to us, such as YouTube, podcast streaming, massive online open courses (MOOC), plain old google searches and more, have enabled people, no matter where they are in the world, to keep up in real time with the breathtaking pace of innovation.  Crypto, in particular, has embraced Twitter, media like CoinDesk and podcasts as their de facto source of knowledge, not Harvard, Stanford, London Business School and the like. It just takes academic institutions too long to develop new curriculum to keep up. It takes an hour to start a podcast and a few years to develop and launch a new educational program at a university.  Read More: Autodidacts Welcome!  As content has become democratized, another phenomenon has emerged as well. Adolescents learning on their own are practically bypassing (or at least outpacing) their teachers in elementary and high school. Take Benyamin Ahmed, for example. A self-professed “13-year-old school boy from London” learned programming at home on Twitter and Discord. He got into crypto and in particular NFTs. Before even becoming a teenager one of his first NFT projects generated more than 1 million British pounds in revenue. In a twist of fate, he became the youngest guest speaker at the renowned Oxford University.  There is a way for education to not get left behind. Universities and schools need to help students get out of books and learn by doing, learn programming early and, perhaps most importantly, facilitate interdisciplinary learning from day one.  Crypto, by default, is a complex blend of economics, behavioral psychology, finance, computer science. Even history and philosophy have relevance to crypto projects and the industry overall. Educators need to bring the real world into the classroom and bring the classroom to the real world. Embrace agile learning, design thinking and multidisciplinarity. Also, universities need to go further to create more dynamic programming that evolves more rapidly, that involves industry professionals (not just Ph.D.s) and maybe invite youths like Benyamin to help universities understand how to reach that generation where they are.  See also: Liberal Arts Colleges Show the 'Inherent Interdisciplinary' Nature of Web3  Lesser-known universities such as the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS), operating in the giant shadows of globally renowned universities such as the National University of Singapore (NUS) and Nanyang Technological University (NTU), often seem to show much more agility. Led for years by their tireless blockchain professor David Lee, SUSS has had a focus on applied blockchain technology through its Node for Inclusive Fintech launching everything from a metaverse lab to the recent hosting of the GWEI Summit that brought academics, students and the crypto industry together to explore how blockchain can impact the real world. Perhaps upstart universities like SUSS can leverage their agility to compete with the entrenched institutions who have often become too “ivory tower.”  Kind of reminds me of several Web3 startups that are disrupting the old guard in every industry from logistics to energy and social media.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,Boyd Cohen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/09/27/ranking-blockchain-universities-is-answering-the-wrong-question,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a3c66a7649c48d307059e887af792abb5f325ea9-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The update, called &apos;the merge,&apos; involved transitioning the network&apos;s consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake.The Ethereum network has been running two blockchains since April 2022. The two blockchains are the original blockchain, using a proof-of-work consensus mechanism, and the &apos;beacon&apos; chain, which implements proof-of-stake. This has allowed people to stake their ether for some time now. However, they haven&apos;t been able to unstake their ether yet.This will eventually change, the first step is the two chains coming together to form one - hence &apos;merge&apos; - on the path to the next step, termed the &apos;Shanghai hard fork.&apos; This update will allow staked ether to be unstaked.If you want to learn more about consensus mechanisms, you can learn more here.What does the shift to proof-of-stake mean for Ethereum?A new business model with proof-of-stakeFirst, new ether is now distributed to those who stake their ether holdings to validator nodes on the ...",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FORKS,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4543456-ethereum-merge-how-shift-to-proof-of-stake-could-impact-investors?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/3320928.jpeg

42416169,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PuaZwt,1664311590,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Takes Investors on a Wild Ride,"Price Action  Bitcoin and ether started the day higher before falling during Tuesday afternoon trading. As traditionally bearish September comes to a close, cryptocurrency markets are hoping the record of bullish Octobers continues. Since 2014, October has been second only to February as the best month for average daily returns. Conversely, the worst month for average daily returns over the same time frame has been September.  Bitcoin’s (BTC) price rose 2% early on strong volume before reversing course. Prices began their push higher in overnight activity, between 23:00 UTC (7:00 p.m. ET) and 05:00 UTC (1:00 a.m. ET), before falling. The price of the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization at one point breached the psychologically important $20,000 mark, but it is now resting under $19,100, about where it started the week.  Ether (ETH) declined 1%, also on higher than average volume. Ether maintains a strong correlation to BTC and displayed similar trading behavior, rising sharply between 23:00 UTC and 05:00 UTC, before declining.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures performance across a basket of cryptocurrencies, rose 3.6% on the day.  Economic Calendar: Month-over-month durable goods orders decreased 0.2% in August versus expectations for a 0.9% decline. The narrower than expected decrease underlined the resiliency of the economy, despite recent rate hikes. The delayed impact of rate hikes may have accounted for the encouraging number.  New home sales in the U.S. jumped by 29% in August, reaching a five- month high of 685,000, and exceeding the consensus estimate of 500,000. Home prices, however, rose by 13.9%, down from 16% the prior month, and the lowest increase since February 2021.  For a Federal Reserve wrestling with the dilemma of taming inflation without stalling the economy too severely, the positive data could encourage the U.S. central bank to continue the current, hawkish pace of interest rate hikes.  Markets currently are pricing in an additional 75 basis point rate hike in November when the Federal Open Market Committee next meets.  Bonds: U.S. bond markets have also been showing signs of stress. Specifically, Bloomberg’s United States Government Liquidity Index has reached its worst level since 2010. “The U.S. bond market is in a very dark, bad place right now,” stated Jim Bianco of Bianco Research.  Illiquid fixed income markets could have a negative impact on other markets, equities and crypto currencies included.  U.S. Equities: Traditional equities were mixed following Monday’s decline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fell 0.4% and 0.2% respectively, while the S&P 500 rose 0.3%  Commodities: In energy markets, WTI crude rose 2.3% while European Brent crude increased by 2.7%. Natural gas fell 3%. Safe-haven asset gold rose 0.3%, while copper prices declined 0.3%.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Technical Take  Bitcoin continues to tango between bullish and bearish activity  Bitcoin and ether spent much of early Tuesday (UTC) in the green before falling. Investors apparently decided two unexpectedly strong economic indicators released just before the U.S. trading day started weren’t enough to outweigh deeper concerns about inflation and the global economy.  Bitcoin was recently trading just below $18,900, off about 1.7% over the past 24 hours. Ether was changing hands just above $1,300, off about 1.5% for the same period.  Both cryptos surged in Tuesday’s wee hours (UTC) and held through much of the day as investors embraced surprisingly good August durable goods orders and housing starts data that raised hopes the Fed could pause its current diet of steep interest rate hikes. Bitcoin’s tendency to spike about this time of the year may have also figured in Tuesday’s price increase. The rise was also surprising given cryptos’ propensity to decline with good economic news suggesting inflation is not under control.  Still, the probability the Federal Reserve will increase rates by 75 basis points declined to 66% from 73%, according to the CME FedWatch tool. The Fed has made stemming inflation its priority.  Meanwhile, at an event hosted by the French central bank Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said regulation of decentralized finance (DeFi) needs to be done “carefully and thoughtfully,” given its limited impact on the real economy. “The DeFi winter … didn’t have significant effects on the banking system and broader financial stability” due to the lack of links between them, Powell told a panel.  Despite the significant role the Ethereum blockchain plays in DeFi, ether traders showed little immediate reaction to Powell’s comments.  Will bitcoin continue its history of strong Octobers?  Since 2014, October has historically been the second-best performing month for bitcoin (average daily returns), while September has historically been the worst.  Traders looking to take advantage of this trend may have been shorting BTC throughout September, while going long BTC near the end of September and into October.  Technically, BTC returned all its prior evening and early morning gains during the afternoon. Trading volume during the 16:00 UTC (12:00 p.m. ET) exceeded its 20-day moving average, indicating conviction behind the downward move.  As BTC rose into overbought territory on its hourly chart, prices suddenly reversed course and now appear to be oversold.  BTC’s daily chart shows that it was unable to maintain Tuesday’s daily high of $20,381, which sits slightly above its average price over the most recent 20 trading days.

Nicole Sales Giles, Christie’s director of digital art sales, noted the significance of moving the entire auction process on-chain. “By incorporating regulatory tools, such as anti-money laundering and sales tax, we have built an inclusive solution where both veteran and new NFT collectors can feel secure in transacting with Christie’s 3.0.”  The 255-year-old auction house has been supporting the sales of NFTs since the digital asset boom in early 2021. Beeple’s ""EVERYDAYS: THE FIRST 5000 DAYS"" NFT was sold by the auction house for $69.3 million in February 2021, and it began to go deeper in its NFT sales when it started selling Curio Cards, an early NFT collection, in September 2021.  Other auction houses, including Sothebys, have also recently embraced NFTs and have helped to bridge the gap between fine art and digital art spaces. In October, Sotheby’s created its own NFT platform called Sotheby’s Metaverse and has released six NFT collections since its initial launch.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/27/christies-auction-house-announces-on-chain-nft-art-platform,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/366ddbf7eb5fb1a7755afd4dcf5d440e4a4ec374-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42393952,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brdEId,1664308074,'Decentralization Under Centralization': How Chinese Universities Teach Blockchain,"Oct. 24, 2019, marked the beginning of a tectonic change for blockchain education in China.  Speaking before the politburo of the Communist Party of China in Beijing on that day, President Xi Jinping said the country needs to ""seize the opportunity"" afforded by blockchain technology. These words would set forth China’s ambitious agenda to take a leading role in the global development of this emerging technology.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Education Week  The universities of China received the message loud and clear. In 2020, 14 Chinese colleges established blockchain technology undergraduate degree programs, following Chengdu University of Information Technology, which had established the country’s first College of Blockchain Technology months before Xi’s speech.  But Xi’s ambition had and continues to have an inherent contradiction. While blockchain technology is admired by the Chinese, its most popular application, cryptocurrencies, is now illegal. In the past decade, China has banned crypto transactions (2013), initial coin offerings (2017), crypto mining (incrementally from 2019-2021) and – the final blow – cryptocurrency trading, in 2021. As a result, the very idea of blockchain is different in China than anywhere else in the world.  ""When discussing blockchain, we cannot see it from a cryptocurrency perspective,"" said Jianhai Chen, associate professor in the ​​College of Computer Science at Zhejiang University. It is ranked 24th in CoinDesk’s 2022 Best Universities for Blockchain. Instead, he threads a needle to teach blockchain for legally approved uses only. “What we want to do is to use blockchain technology to empower industries and solve existing problems,” Chen said.  Read the Full List: Best Universities for Blockchain 2022  How do Chinese universities educate students in blockchain and conform to the government’s wishes? Faculty, students and employers describe a push for massive technical proficiency that leaves those excited by the transformative potential of blockchain technology frustrated, ignored and forging their own path outside of institutionalized education.  Government encouragement  The most populous nation in the world with 1.4 billion people, China counts roughly 40 million civil servants in its vast government as of December 2021, according to the National Bureau of Statistics in China. Xi’s 2019 declaration unleashed a top-down approach that led to masses of civil servants learning about blockchain all at once.  ""[Xi’s blockchain imperative] is a policy direction. Whether people understand it or not, they have started to pay high attention to it,"" said Jie Hu, professor of fintech and blockchain at the Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance (SAIF), part of the esteemed Shanghai Jiao Tong University, ranked 12th in CoinDesk’s 2022 Best Universities for Blockchain.  Over the past three years Chen said he has given hundreds of three-hour lectures about blockchain to leaders in various areas, including local governments, bank governors and faculty members in other colleges. He said the lectures have covered mostly basic themes including what is blockchain technology, why do we need blockchain technology and what are the use cases of blockchain technology.  Even as this mass education effort has progressed, government ministries have added blockchain jobs to the nation’s recognized job titles and blockchain as an elective to the computer skills expected from college graduates.  In 2020, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security announced two new blockchain occupations – blockchain technology technician and blockchain application operator – that establish criteria for what kind of blockchain skills China needs. Technicians are engaged in blockchain architecture design, working on the back end with the underlying technology, system applications, testing, deployment, operation and maintenance. Operators use blockchain technology and tools to run system applications in government, finance, medicine, education and other scenarios.  According to local news media outlet Guangzhou Daily, the government of Shenzhen in Guangdong Province held its first Blockchain Application Operator (Level 4) vocational skill level recognition exam this past July. Anyone who passed the exam received a certificate from the government as well as an education certificate issued by Tencent, the China-based multinational technology and entertainment company that distributed study materials for the exam. Certificate holders are eligible to receive government subsidies from Guangdong.  These certificates can give a leg up to residents seeking a designation called a hukou. A hukou provides access to public services such as schools, health insurance and social security. Such status can be especially difficult to attain in the densely populated major cities. But without a hukou in Shanghai, for example, a resident could live there and work for years and might not be eligible to purchase a home.  All college students in Shanghai must take a computer skills exam that includes blockchain technology and application as an elective subject. The certificates awarded to passing students give them points when applying for a hukou.  “After President Xi’s speech, local governments have introduced lots of incentive policies to encourage the development of blockchain technology,” said Hu.  Classrooms without soul  Blockchain is a technology that records data permanently, like an immutable receipt that is resistant to alteration or government interference.  There are permissionless blockchains and permissioned blockchains. The most common blockchains are permissionless, without any centralized control or gatekeeper, that records data publicly and immutably. But in China only permissioned blockchains are allowed, which means if the government does not want certain data in the public record, it cannot change it but has the right to delete the whole chain.  ""Blockchain in China is decentralization under centralization,” said Zhejiang University’s Chen. “This is blockchain with Chinese characteristics.”  Rather than debate permissioned versus permissionless blockchains, however, most educators focus on the technical aspects, the programming itself, which professors and students alike see as limiting and counterproductive.  ""If blockchain education in China only focuses on technical talents, you are training outsourced talents for the U.S.,"" said Han Tang, a recent dropout from a master’s program in fintech. Under this constraint, Tang added, China “will not cultivate any leading figures in Web3.""  As the co-founder of Tanlianjiazhi, a news organization focused on blockchain and fintech, Tang claims to be the first person to have introduced the wildly popular non-fungible token (NFT) collection CryptoPunks to China. Wanting to be a creator rather than an observer and reporter on the crypto scene, however, she applied for and was accepted into a two-year master’s program in fintech at Peking University, one of China’s premier universities. (Peking University was ranked 13th in CoinDesk’s Best Universities for Blockchain 2022.)  In mainland China, passing a standardized Postgraduate Admission Test is an admission requirement for all graduate schools. When Tang took the exam in 2020, she was among 3.41 million people registered. It was a huge effort to get into the program, but Tang dropped out after just six months because she said she found the curriculum and teaching out-of-touch with current trends.  ""The content taught in school was still about peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, while the fintech industry is already in the era of decentralized finance” (or DeFi), Tang said. Worse than being outdated, however, Tang also took issue with the narrow approach to blockchain education.  “In any top universities in China someone must be doing research on blockchain, but [in the classroom] we focus on introducing the basics to students in all majors,” said Baixiang Liu, chief technical specialist at Shanghai Blockchain Engineering Technology Research Center and a co-author of “Blockchain Technology Fundamentals and Practice.” Liu, who also works as a researcher at Fudan University, added, “We will introduce tokens to the students but at the same time make it clear that certain operations are not allowed in China.” (Fudan was ranked 28th in CoinDesk’s Best Universities for Blockchain 2022.)  Read Best Universities for Blockchain 2022: Where In the World Is the Most Research Being Produced?  In fact, there is a joke in the Chinese Web3 community that is engaged in popular blockchain applications, legal or not, such as gaming, the metaverse, non-fungible tokens and crypto: If you ask students majoring in blockchain technology what MetaMask is, they don’t recognize the name of the most popular crypto wallet.  Ignoring popular applications like crypto and transformative ideas like decentralization that were inspired by blockchain is too severe a classroom handicap to overcome, said Tang. ""For various reasons, the education in China cannot talk about the aspect of culture in Web3. Blockchain education in China pretends to cut the cultural part and only keep the technical aspect.”  She cited Vitalik Buterin's co-written research paper ”Decentralized Society: Finding Web3's Soul,” where he proposed the concept of ""Soulbound"" tokens and argued they would form the foundations of the Web3 decentralized future.  ""Vitalik is talking about how people can live better and in what way people can organize to live better. It is discussing humanistic things, not technical things,"" Tang said.  Tang opted to learn by doing. She dropped out in March 2021 to start SeeDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) dedicated to cultivating DAO talent for the Chinese-speaking world. She said her startup has also completed a Series A funding round with investors including Hong Kong's HashKey Capital and is now valued at $30 million.  Tang’s opinion is shared by other students. “For current blockchain education in China, at least, the soil of gaining knowledge is not in colleges,” said 0xaA, a fourth-year neuroscience Ph.D student and the president of the Peking University Blockchain Association.  Jobs for the masses  Several months before President Xi declared China leading the world in blockchain technology as a national goal, Chengdu University of Information Technology in Sichuan province established the College of Blockchain Technology. Unlike a top academic university such as Tsinghua University or Peking University, Chengdu University of Information Technology is considered closer to what in the U.S. would be a vocational college. The following year, 14 other schools in China similar to Chengdu announced blockchain technology undergraduate degree programs.  More than 700 freshmen started their undergraduate program in Chengdu’s brand-new college, the first of its kind in the country, and possibly the world. According to the college, its curriculum covers basic computer programming courses, blockchain-related professional courses, such as cryptography and distributed systems, and the development of consortium chains, which are permissioned blockchains, and smart contract deployment. This is blockchain education focused solely on the technical aspects for the masses.  ""In 2019, there were over 1,000 blockchain companies. Seeing the increasing demand for talents, we decided to establish this new undergraduate degree,"" said Fei Li, a professor who specializes in security of the internet of things at the college.  Indeed, the outlook for technical blockchain jobs is bright in China. As of the end of July 2022, there were more than 2,100 blockchain information services registered entities in mainland China, according to the data from the Cyberspace Administration of China. The five-year compound annual growth rate (2020-2024) of China's blockchain market is expected to reach 54.6% – fastest in the world – International Data Corporation data shows. There will be a surplus demand for blockchain talent in China, forecasts international consulting firm Gartner, which projects China's blockchain talent gap will reach more than 750,000 people.  Yifan He, CEO of Red Date Technology and the technical architect of China's state-backed Blockchain Service Network, said the demand for blockchain talent today in China is relatively small compared with its potential.  ""The current blockchain in China is like the internet in 1992, when people only thought that the internet could only be used to send emails,"" He said, ""while people's understanding of blockchain still focuses on cryptocurrency."" He predicts clear demand for permissioned, non-crypto blockchain talent in five years.  But much can change in five years, especially in the emerging tech space where one day is like a week and one week is like a year. Others in the industry question whether the growth can continue in this vein despite the legal restrictions on blockchain.  “Sometimes we have a mindset of cutting corners to catch up with the west,” said Xiao Zhang, a computer science teacher from Shandong Technology and Business University. “However, in Web3, there is no shortcut.""  Having worked as a Polkadot ambassador in China in 2020 – contributing to the blockchain’s interoperability protocol community – Zhang established the zCloak Network, a privacy-preserving computing platform. His perspective is rare, as a higher education teacher who also works on Web3 projects. ""It seems almost impossible that we will reap a harvest if we stand outside of the Web3 world only,"" Zhang said.  University students are finding ways to get inside the world of Web3 and crypto, despite the bans. Though language barriers are difficult to overcome, the students can be found engaging in western social and messaging apps such as Twitter, Discord and Telegram.  Informally, students also are reaching out to alumni and private enterprise to get a handle on what blockchain technology is in the real world. THUBA DAO, a DAO initiated by students of the Tsinghua University Student Blockchain Association, held its first Twitter ask-me-anything event in August with Uniswap Labs, the company behind Ethereum-based decentralized exchange Uniswap. That same month, THUBA DAO held a global hackathon, open to all university students, that received over 60 projects. (Tsinghua was ranked 6th in Best Universities for Blockchain 2022.)  ""Policy [in China] has an impact on the whole industry. If we can't understand tokens objectively and make proper regulation, it will actually become a bottleneck for blockchain development in China,"" said SAIF’s Hu, who also is a cofounder of an early-stage metaverse startup. But he is taking a long view of progress.  “There may still be some years to go before we see significant results, after all these resources have been rushed in,” Hu said.

The launch of the community-driven project, dubbed Urbit Virtual Machine (UVM), represents the latest step the controversial Urbit project has taken into the world of crypto, as Urbit insiders attempt to build what they call ""sound computer"" infrastructure. It also highlights how a recent surge in public interest and developer count could lead Urbit to places never envisioned or desired by its committed user base.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The blockchain is what’s known as an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), a type of cryptocurrency network built to run decentralized applications that could plug into and replicate the things built on Ethereum, the world’s second-largest blockchain.  See also: 'More Bang for Less Byte': ICOs Confront Growing Pains | (2017)  ""For better or worse, EVM is the language of DeFi,"" doplur said in an interview at the Assembly conference in Miami last weekend, referring to decentralized finance. ""There is a huge amount of capital on Ethereum, and if we want Urbit to be relevant there needs to be a way to communicate between the networks.""  Crypto courtship  The launch of UVM comes at a time when Urbit coders are actively attempting to court decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and DeFi to the platform. Its suite of applications, many of which launched in recent months, could rival centralized crypto mainstays like Discord and Slack. The recently launched Uqbar Ethereum layer 2 network gives Urbit native crypto utility.  ""While they are trying to grow adoption, I don’t think the Urbit community necessarily want 'crypto types' to invade overnight and dilute the mission, at least not until there is immunity against the meaningless charades we see in crypto,"" Michelle Lai, an early Anchorage Digital hire and Urbit enthusiast, said.  For some in Urbit, UVM’s airdrop and white paper was reminiscent of the initial coin offering boom of in 2017 – a period now remembered for its litany of unfinished projects and outright scams, when “crypto devs” could raise millions of dollars from retail investors looking to buy into projects like “decentralized Uber” or “Dentacoin.”  ""They shipped before they had a usable product,"" Lane Rettig, a core developer of crypto community Spacemesh and former Ethereum Foundation coder, said. Urbit’s message boards were lit up with people questioning whether the functionality would ever be needed, he added, though Rettig chose to withhold his own opinion on the matter.  Urbit, which was founded by controversial blogger Curtis Yarvin (aka Mencius Moldbug) and which was built primarily by the company he founded and stepped back from, Tlon, hasn’t followed the traditional model of network development favored by the Silicon Valley software industry (often summed up as “move fast and break things”).  See also: Urbit Is Web3, Weird and Wonderful and I Don't Care Who Built It  Instead, it has unfolded slowly – aiming for the grandiose aim of giving everyone a personal server from which to run any type of computer application (like email, web browsing and online payments). Initially, the janky virtual computer was accessible only by the command line. For years, essentially the only service available was a stripped-down messaging platform and weather app.  ""For anyone who has followed the project, it seems like an organic process,"" Pax Dickinson, former chief technology officer of Business Insider and founder of Urbit infrastructure builder Wexman Systems, said in an interview. To date, Urbit was built primarily by the well-funded San Fransisco-based organization Tlon, which allowed it to take shape deliberately – from its two bespoke programming languages on up – and follow a clear roadmap.  Doplur's UVM system is among the first major projects to go live on Urbit without Tlon's involvement or funding from one of its sister agencies, like the Urbit Foundation. Doplur said he started work on the project a few months ago after ""Urbit NYC Week,"" and hopes to receive financial support for his efforts ""some day.""  It's worth noting that one of crypto's great innovations is the ability to self-fund projects through token launches – solving what is sometimes called the ""cold start problem” of gaining potential users and financial runway for a new network. However, Lai and Rettig both note how one of Urbit's charms is that it has avoided the ""financialization"" of crypto so far.  ""You’ll find people who hate crypto here,"" Lai said. Assembly, the Miami conference, brought together a number of high-profile speakers from the world of crypto (including figures like Balaji Srinivasan, the former chief technology officer of crypto exchange Coinbase and DAO expert Aaron Wright) and the wider culture world (like author Walter Kirn, filmmaker Alex Lee Moyer and internet historian Katherine Dee).  For years, users of Urbit were self-filtering: Only those that could grok its peculiar argot and understand the tech ended up staying around. But the project is rapidly gaining cultural relevancy, and efforts are being made to more easily onboard users.  Airdrop caution  The new token was airdropped to 4.5 million Ethereum addresses, including all users who have an .eth wallet address as well as all Urbit “ship” holders, in an attempt to spur adoption, doplur said. The blockchain’s validation process will open this week, giving people a chance to stake their tokens and earn yield. A healthy fraction of the tokens was held in reserve to pay for later network development, including bridges to Ethereum, privacy tools and scaling products.  ""We noticed our first meme coin a few hours after launch! We are excited to see what the community comes up with,"" doplur said. $URBIT is not yet fully bridged to the wider crypto economy, and doesn’t yet have a price.  Although the $URBIT launch has yet to break into the wider crypto conversation, it is a possible sign of difficult conversations to come as Urbit continues to grow. Permissionless systems are open for anyone to add onto and use, probably in ways that a network’s first group of highly committed users never intended.  ""Nothing on Urbit needs to be sanctioned! It's open source, public infrastructure. Anything can build anything they want. In general, it's great for the system when people experiment,"" Tlon CEO Galen Wolfe-Pauly said via email. He added that “Urbit will definitely be a place where commerce happens” and tokens are to be expected.  Doplur said a more decentralized EVM chain tethered to Urbit could also encourage Ethereum developers to “refocus” on censorship resistance, amid rising concerns about potential network takeovers after Ethereum’s shift to a proof-of-stake system and the government sanctioning of Tornado Cash, the Ethereum-based cryptocurrency mixer.  Urbit’s official Twitter account said users should approach UVM with “caution.”  ""I’m not connecting my (digital wallet) MetaMask for this 'free AirDrop',"" Lai said, showing how she’s being cautious for now.  UPDATE (SEPT. 27, 2022 – 23:55 UTC): Adds context about UVM's founding.  CORRECTION (SEPT. 28, 2022 – 13:10 UTC): Corrects Josh Lehman's title in the photo caption.

Mayor Lori Lightfoot had attended the opening ceremony on FTX.US’s glitzy, 9,000 square foot office space in downtown Chicago, and touted the benefits of FTX’s presence in the Windy City – especially a pilot program sponsored by FTX that would provide supplemental income and financial education for underbanked Chicago residents.  FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried announced the Miami move in a tweet on Tuesday morning.  A representative for FTX did not immediately respond to requests for comment about FTX’s decision to move its U.S. headquarters so soon, or what would become of the Chicago pilot program.  When speaking with Bloomberg about the move on Tuesday, FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried said that establishing offices all over the world was key to the company’s mission of getting licensure for its various businesses. FTX moved its global headquarters from Hong Kong to the Bahamas in September.  “Frankly, for us, having clear licensure for our marketplaces is by far the biggest piece of this, that’s what we’ve been focusing on,” Bankman-Fried said.  Miami has become a hot spot for crypto companies in the U.S., second only to New York in terms of cities with the most investments in crypto startups. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez has made attracting crypto companies and talent a key priority for his administration, emphasizing the comparatively lax regulations and lower tax burden there.  Several companies, including crypto exchange Blockchain.com and now FTX.US, have moved their headquarters to Miami. Others, including fellow exchange eToro, have expanded their U.S. presence with offices in the city.  Last March, FTX.US purchased the naming rights to the Miami Heat arena for $135 million.  FTX.US President Brett Harrison, who was based in Chicago prior to FTX setting up an office there in June 2021, announced he would be stepping down on Tuesday.  His resignation is one of a spate of recent executive resignations from crypto companies, including MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor, and Kraken CEO Jesse Powell.

42411362,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNIdA,1664300702,Interpreting the CFTC’s Lawsuit Against Ooki DAO,"Hey folks. I’m in San Francisco covering Circle’s Converge conference this week. Around? Say hi. But in the meantime, let’s talk about the CFTC and the sudden chill it has cast over the crypto world.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  The narrative  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) sued Ooki DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization, last week. The CFTC alleged Ooki DAO was offering leveraged and margin trading products without registering as a Futures Commission Merchant (FCM), a legal requirement in the U.S.  Why it matters  The complaint is a dagger into the belief that decentralization is a defense against regulation. Admittedly, it’s not the first time we’ve seen U.S. regulators indicate that decentralization really isn’t a defense, but because of the way the CFTC has worded its complaint it seems especially concerning. The short version is that, in the CFTC’s view, every single voting participant in a DAO can and should be held individually liable for any illicit activity conducted by the DAO.  Breaking it down  If you missed this news last week, the slightly longer version of what happened is the CFTC settled charges with bZeroX and its founders Tom Bean and Kyle Kistner, alleging the company had illegally offered leveraged and margin trading products to U.S. persons without registering as a Designated Contract Market (DCM) or an FCM.  I tweeted my read-through of the case – you can catch up on that thread on the link – but basically the CFTC said bZeroX offered products the regulator should be overseeing. Bean and Kistner offered to settle, paying a (paltry) $250,000 fine and promising not to break the law or CFTC rules again.  The decentralized squiggle here is bZeroX converted from a service provided by a centralized company with two operators to a service provided by a DAO with many operators. The CFTC filed a complaint against the DAO (originally called bZx, now named Ooki), alleging basically the same things alleged against bZeroX.  My interpretation of what happened next is that the CFTC, having found a settlement with these two intrepid individuals who were unwilling to be dragged into an expensive legal fight, saw the DAO as a natural extension of the company and felt that it had to bring similar charges. What’s more, because Ooki and bZeroX literally did the same thing, the CFTC didn’t really need to stretch to find its cause of action.  “A key bZeroX objective in transferring control of the bZx Protocol (now the Ooki Protocol) to the bZx DAO (now the Ooki DAO) was to attempt to render the bZx DAO, by its decentralized nature, enforcement-proof. Put simply, the bZx Founders believed they had identified a way to violate the Act and Regulations, as well as other laws, without consequence … The bZx Founders were wrong, however. DAOs are not immune from enforcement and may not violate the law with impunity,” the complaint said.  And it’s worth noting that, despite this edition’s headline, the decentralization or lack thereof of a DAO doesn’t seem to be a concern for this action. Rather, it’s the actual activities the DAO engaged in – i.e., the same activities bZeroX engaged in – that are the source of this lawsuit.  CFTC targets voting token holders  No one seems to have any issue with the events as they occurred up to this point. Where things get hairy is in assigning liability to the DAO operators. And, in fairness to the regulators, this is a bit of a tough needle to thread.  The CFTC decided that anyone who voted as part of the DAO’s governance process should be held individually liable. That's a pretty broad net. Some of the alternative choices the CFTC had would have been to charge every token holder – which would have been even more broad and perhaps difficult to enforce – or identify which voters specifically chose to engage in the illegal actions at stake.  In turn, charging every recipient of an airdrop would have been, quite frankly, ridiculous. People get tokens all the time through airdrops for projects in which they didn’t necessarily plan to participate. It would be like the Treasury Department charging a celebrity who got dusted with Tornado Cash ether.  It would also probably be a logistical nightmare.  Identifying more specific users would be pretty difficult, too, I imagine. Plus, the CFTC could always argue that the mere act of participating in the governance process of a DAO explicitly engaged in illegal activity makes someone liable. It’s not like Ooki DAO started off engaging in only legal activity and later started getting into leveraged products. The DAO was specifically created to continue operating the unregistered FCM.  We’ve also seen regulators repeatedly go after companies and entities for allegedly illegal activity, even if the company has started taking steps to transition away from that activity. Just recently, eight state regulators sued crypto lender Nexo, which announced in February it would stop offering its yield-generating Earn interest products to U.S. users after fellow lender BlockFi settled charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and several state regulators.  So the fact the CFTC did indeed choose to go the route that it did should not be a total surprise. But, of course, it’s going to be controversial. CFTC Commissioner Summer Mersinger explained her disagreement with the CFTC’s chosen path in a dissent, but added in a footnote that merely capturing all token holders is also not ideal.  CoinDesk’s Cheyenne Ligon spoke to several lawyers about the implications of the case, who all largely agreed that while the CFTC saying decentralization doesn’t protect against regulatory action, they were surprised by the targeting of voting token holders.  The next steps, I think, are answering some of the following questions:  Who’s actually going to be held liable? Is the CFTC looking for a way to identify the Ooki DAO participants who are liable under the regulator’s interpretation?  How active is the DAO anyway?  How will Ooki DAO respond?  Does this mean the CFTC is no longer the “friendlier” regulator?  What does this mean for decentralization?  That last question, at least, I think has an easy answer: Nothing. The CFTC is saying decentralization isn’t a defense against regulatory action, something we saw before when the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Tornado Cash. I don’t think we can really read more into the case than that at this point.

42411347,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNHzU,1664299167,The DeFi Financial Crime Arms Race,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) is a vibrant and innovative ecosystem that has the potential to improve efficiency and transparency in financial markets and serve as a driving force in redefining the future of finance. Built on public permissionless blockchains, DeFi’s mission is to give anyone with an internet connection the ability to tap into financial services, which in turn promotes equal opportunity and financial democratization around the world.  However, given its open nature, DeFi is undergoing the same arms race that has plagued every nascent but innovative technology and industry: fighting criminals who want to take advantage of it.  DeFi is no stranger to financial crime. In 2021, money laundering in crypto accounted for more than $8 billion, with almost $1 billion of this being sent to DeFi protocols. While these headline numbers are concerning, let’s put them in context. It’s estimated that somewhere between 100 and 250 times that number in fiat currency is laundered each year in traditional financial markets – most of it opaque, much of it undetected, and even less acted upon by law enforcement.  Michael Karbouris is vice president and head of strategy, anti-financial crime technology at Nasdaq.  The fact that we can estimate with a much higher degree of accuracy how much money is being laundered in DeFi highlights a truth that is sometimes overlooked: DeFi is largely transparent, and a transparent market should in theory be easier to police. The ability to monitor almost every transaction is something that is still near impossible to carry out in traditional fiat markets. And yes, while privacy-oriented protocols in DeFi will likely only get more popular, the beauty of zero-knowledge proof technology is that it allows opt-in transparency while maintaining privacy through pseudo-anonymity.  When it comes to DeFi, ultimately we all want an ecosystem with integrity, one that breeds confidence for the growing crypto community. But simply looking to traditional finance (TradFi) as a model on how to achieve this is not optimal. Rather than trying to fit existing regulations tailored for TradFi markets, we should be understanding DeFi’s idiosyncrasies, focusing on the types of financial crimes that are unique to the DeFi ecosystem and that truly hurt the end user, and aligning methods of detection and prevention with crypto’s core values of decentralization and trustlessness.  The various shades of DeFi-specific financial crime  The whole point of laundering money is to make illicit income, usually generated through criminal activity, appear legal. When it comes to crypto, criminal activities such as theft and fraud can look vastly different to how they appear in traditional financial markets. This is a result of the public nature of the technology, lack of intermediaries and the pseudo-anonymity afforded by permissionless blockchains.  Theft via ransomware is a technical affair, and stopping it relies heavily on a victim’s cybersecurity hygiene. Especially during periods of mass user adoption, many unsuspecting users might be expected to be lacking in this area. Intentional fraud (such as rug pulls or admin key exploits) has unfortunately been common in DeFi and has caused billions in unnecessary losses. Some estimates believe that rug pulls account for ~40% of stolen funds in DeFi.  See also: Why DeFi Might Be Safer Than Traditional Finance | Opinion  Another category, contract exploits, are a huge contributor to stolen funds. Recent examples include the Axie Ronin bridge exploit for $650 million and the Wormhole bridge exploit of over $320 million. Funds in DeFi are usually stored in smart contracts and governed by a protocol decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). These smart contracts are typically publicly available for all to see. Because of the speed with which innovation takes place in DeFi, many protocols launch with bugs or design flaws or before they are truly battle tested. The shores of DeFi are littered with corpses of protocols that were exploited and drained of funds.  A third, more subtle category of financial crime behaviors exists exclusively on-chain. These are behaviors specific to the idiosyncrasies of the blockchain. They do not fit squarely in the realm of financial crime defined within TradFi. If you look at these behaviors closely, they are financial crimes highly specific to DeFi. For example, composability attacks are unique given the composable nature of DeFi, where individual protocol functions are made openly available for any other protocol to use and reuse.  Another example unique to DeFi is mempool front-running and sandwich attacks. Here, a bot will look for pending transactions in the mempool used to temporarily store transactions prior to a block being confirmed. The bot will simultaneously front-run and back-run the transaction by placing an order just before the trade and just after it. The net result is an unfavorable impact to the price of the asset, much like front-running in traditional markets.  We cannot hope to solve financial crime in DeFi without first understanding the idiosyncrasies of the ecosystem, and working with a community mindset that sees the value in adopting effective prevention systems aligned to these problems. Unfortunately, regulation born from TradFi, when imposed on a novel ecosystem such as DeFi, has the potential to do more harm than good.  A hotly debated example is the recent OFAC sanctions against popular mixer Tornado Cash. This is the first time OFAC has sanctioned decentralized protocol code instead of an individual, group or property. The ruling has far-reaching implications on individual due process and rights to privacy, risks stifling innovation, and while it may serve as a deterrent, it is unlikely to achieve meaningful crime prevention.  See also: Advisors Should Look Before Clients Leap Into DeFi | Opinion  How we can protect the less-transparent CeFi ecosystem  Ironically, one of the areas where DeFi loses its advantage of transparency is when funds move to a centralized exchange – effectively going off-chain. Here, regulators must rely on market participants to detect unusual activity.  Surveillance of activity on central limit order books (CLOB) helps detect suspicious market abuse activities, like insider trading, and order book manipulation like spoofing and layering. The vast majority of market abuse carried out today is not performed via DeFi on-chain and can instead be detected by the crypto exchange themselves. Crypto exchanges should monitor their CLOB with effective market surveillance technology – an approach that is well aligned with rules that already apply to regulated centralized firms.  Similar detection for money laundering and fraudulent financial crimes in centralized finance (CeFi) can be done for fiat deposit-taking accounts at centralized exchanges. Here, fiat banking transactions can be used to build a much better understanding of customer behavior and matched with on-chain activity. Firms can find anomalies in the flow of customer funds that are indicative of fraudulent activity or money laundering either on- or off-chain.  Ultimately, once funds move off-chain to a centralized exchange or other crypto service provider, the onus lies back with the centralized party to monitor for illegal behavior.  A smart technology needs smart regulation  In general, the DeFi ecosystem is filled with mostly good actors. Many DeFi protocols as well as centralized firms that are innovating in DeFi are genuinely interested in a clean market and want to avoid criminal activity. There are banks, service providers and other regulated institutions that want to partake in crypto through issuance of stablecoins, provision of institutional-grade crypto custody, and the introduction of a whole host of new and novel crypto products and services. The spectrum of possible DeFi users spans the entirety of the global economy.  How can we help DeFi grow into a safer and better environment for all? Rather than creating regulations that force industry to abstain from DeFi, or trying to fit a novel DeFi ecosystem into a traditional financial system box, it would be more beneficial for regulators to truly understand the unique risks inherent in this innovative new ecosystem and design bespoke, light-touch regulation to address it. In parallel, the crypto industry should be building better detection systems to help isolate these unique types of financial crimes and protect the protocol end users and protocols themselves.  As it rapidly evolves, DeFi would greatly benefit from a fresh approach to stamping out financial crimes – and regulators would benefit from looking at DeFi through a lens that acknowledges the core value proposition of crypto: a trustless, decentralized and pseudonymous environment. We should help individuals and institutions feel confident interacting with and investing in DeFi, and ultimately the crypto ecosystem will grow, mature and deliver on its mission as it was envisioned.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Michael Karbouris,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/09/27/the-defi-financial-crime-arms-race,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3d9222221ff944ca7c0766e67947dd4d9b5bd6a2-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As for bitcoin, he noted that its price has risen, despite a lack of ""good news.""  ""So imagine what a bit of good news like pausing interest rate [hikes] would mean to traders in the stock market and in the crypto market. Because stocks and crypto are so tightly correlated these days, it would be fantastic if opposing interest rates could just cheer everybody up,"" he said.  Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, rose more than 5% during early hours on Tuesday, nudging just above the key psychological threshold of $20,000.  Traders are analyzing bitcoin’s performance in the context of what’s happening in broader foreign-exchange markets.  Over the past five days, the British pound, Japanese yen and the Chinese yuan have plummeted significantly against the U.S. dollar.  A reversal in the dollar’s rise could come as traders “start taking their profits,” according to Goodman. This could lead to a burst in the dollar's bubble, eventually.  Read more: First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Regains $20K, Bucking the Swoon in Stocks  Goodman, who has more than two decades of trading experience, said central banks may need to pause the rise in interest rates to prevent a further “dangerous economic and market situation.”  The dollar’s strength has put pressure on countries with high loads of debt denominated in the U.S. currency.  “As the dollar rises, those debts get more and more expensive for all those countries to service,” Goodman said. “The only way that they can counter that is by raising the value of their own currencies, which means they have to raise interest rates, too.”  Read more: Decentralized Exchange Bancor Proposes Burning 1M BNT Tokens to Support Prices  Falling commodities prices could be showing early signs that “inflation in the U.S. will naturally come down,” Goodman said.  “At the moment, markets are looking for any reason to rise,” he said.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/27/there-are-no-safe-havens-when-the-dollar-is-strong-veteran-trader-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f8f513128dd5838d932aee2261cb70a4d13cdd60-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Eclipse’s $9 million seed round was co-led by Tribe Capital and Tabiya, a crypto venture capital firm started by former Binance executives. Other participants in the round included Infinity Ventures Crypto, Soma Capital, Struck Crypto and CoinList.  The platform’s earlier $6 million pre-seed round was led by Polychain Capital and included participation from Tribe Capital, Tabiya, Galileo, Polygon Ventures, The House Fund, and Accel.  Eclipse is a customizable rollup provider that is compatible with multiple layer-1 blockchains. The platform enables developers to deploy their own rollup powered by the Solana operating system, using any chain for security or data storage.  Rollups, a category of layer-2s, help blockchains scale by increasing a chain’s throughput, which allows applications to handle more transactions in a given time frame.  “We’re like a universal layer-2,” Eclipse co-founder Neel Somani told CoinDesk. “Solana, Sui and Aptos are fast, but they don’t offer enough throughput to enable on-chain anything too computationally intensive, like machine learning.”  Eclipse, Somani says, will open the door for more “proactive use cases” for crypto.

The funding comes as MPCH prepares to launch its first product, Fraction, a customizable operating platform that allows multiple users to securely manage digital assets, wallets and workflows, according to a press release.  New York-based MPCH Labs is developing products based on Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology, a cryptographic security technique where private keys are split and stored in a different location. MPCH used MPC technology to build its proprietary MPC6 engine, which lets multiple parties sign, authorize, approve and view actions within the same wallet. Fraction, built on the MPC6 engine, will launch in the fourth quarter of this year.  “Fraction was never about building a better MPC wallet,"" said MPCH co-founder Cat Le-Huy in the press release. ""Fraction was about driving crypto to succeed and enabling wider-adoption outside of the crypto-native world ... By providing resilient, secure, and extensible infrastructure around multipermissioned MPC wallets, we believe that we can play a part in unleashing the full potential of crypto.”  Banks and traditional financial institutions wanting to enter the world of digital assets are concerned about security and the custody of the assets. The concerns have created a growing debate about whether hardware security, MPC or a combination of both offer the best solution for TradFi players.  Liberty City Ventures helped incubate or nurture the growth of NPCH Labs.

In addition to being president of FTX.US, Harrison also ran FTX Stocks and FTX U.S. Derivatives.  “Over the next few months I’ll be transferring my responsibilities and moving into an advisory role at the company,” Harrison wrote in a tweet thread.  Zach Dexter, the CEO of FTX's U.S. derivatives unit, will take over Harrison's role overseeing the whole of FTX.US, according to a source familiar with the matter. Dexter was previously the CEO of LedgerX, and joined FTX in October 2021 after the completion of FTX’s acquisition of the regulated futures exchange.  Harrison's departure is one of several in a recent spate of high-profile resignations in the crypto industry. Earlier on Tuesday, the CEO of bankrupt crypto lending firm Celsius Network, Alex Mashinsky, also announced he would be stepping down. Last week, the controversial CEO of crypto exchange Kraken, Jesse Powell, announced that he would be handing over the reins to COO Dave Ripley. And in late August, Sam Trabucco, the co-CEO of Alameda Research – the trading firm founded by FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried – resigned, leaving Caroline Ellison as the sole CEO.  August also saw the resignation of MicroStrategy's longtime CEO, Michael Saylor, although he has taken on the role of executive chairman at the firm he founded, and the exit of the CEO of troubled crypto broker Genesis, Michael Moro. (Genesis is owned by Digital Currency Group, which is also the parent of CoinDesk.)  Harrison had served as president of FTX.US since May 2021, according to his LinkedIn profile. Previously he had worked for almost two years at market maker Citadel Securities and before that for 7 1/2 years as the head of trading systems technology at investment firm Jane Street.  Harrison didn't say what he else he would be doing next, but noted that “I’m remaining in the industry with the goal of removing technological barriers to full participation in and maturation of global crypto markets, both centralized and decentralized.""

42373736,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvUzLb,1664293146,"Blockchain Securities Trading Doesn’t Need More Rule Changes, EU Agency Says","Securities trading using distributed ledger technology (DLT) doesn’t require further changes to market transparency law, the European Securities and Markets Authority said in a report Tuesday – but the agency did concede its guidance will need to adapt to the Web3 era.  The European Union (EU) recently agreed to new laws to enable innovative ways to trade stocks and bonds using the blockchain, by easing requirements to use brokers and use a separate securities depositary – and the trial is set to start in March 2023.  Today the European Securities and Markets Authority said there was no need for changes to the subsidiary regulations it’s responsible for as a result of that trial – but also revealed high market interest in trying out the new rules.  “A significant number of market participants expressed interest in operating a DLT MI [market infrastructure] under the DLT Pilot,” the report said. ESMA cited interest from trading floors and settlement infrastructure, both new players and incumbents, from inside and outside the bloc.  Proponents say the new systems, allowing trading of tokenized securities could prove more transparent and efficient, helping cut out the middleman from financial-market trading – but getting the highly regulated sector to adapt might not be straightforward.  “ESMA will not amend existing requirements on post-trade transparency and could provide further guidance,” the regulator said, promising new guidelines “either before the application of the DLT Pilot, or based on first experiences of the Pilot, as appropriate.”  Existing subsidiary EU laws, known as regulatory technical standards, set out exactly how and when the details of stock and bond trades need to be published to help shine a light on what financial markets are up to.  But respondents have complained the rules need tweaking, since traditional finance norms don’t always work in crypto land. While trade in stocks, say, would need to be reported within one minute, validating a bitcoin transaction can take as much as one hour, they note.

The teams have worked together previously, as Monica and other members of Anchorage Digital were early members of the Technical Steering Committee of Diem, Aptos’ former stablecoin project under Meta. “By partnering with Aptos, we’re actually helping make sure that the next generation of layer 1 blockchains are taking these proper [security] considerations and that will only spur future growth in the industry,” said Monica.  Mo Shaikh, the co-founder and CEO of Aptos, said in a statement to CoinDesk that “Anchorage has been our partner since Day Zero, helping us make the technical and security considerations to make our launch a strong start and prioritize future growth with user experience as a core focus.”  Monica believes that during this period of market volatility, consumers have been looking for layer 1 blockchains that offer Aptos’ security. The blockchain project will be using Move for its smart contract programming language, which is purposefully built with “proofs.”  By using Move, users can inspect and look at the code, and run it through proofs that show the objectives of the smart contract.  Bear market is not hindering institutional growth  As institutional adoption continues to grow, it is apparent that services for cryptocurrencies continue to have a demand. Monica noticed an increased demand for institutional adoption of crypto investments, too: “We're led by the market; when institutional investors want to invest in something, we obviously are interested in supporting it,” said Monica.  In addition to the Aptos partnership, Anchorage announced earlier this month that it would begin to offer a Japanese yen stablecoin, adding to its U.S. digital dollar and digital euro offerings.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | APT,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/27/crypto-custody-firm-anchorage-digital-to-be-preferred-custodian-for-layer-1-blockchain-aptos-labs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f3aa60677c45d3ba07e70b84740fbcbe0b6d6c9a-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Some analysts are predicting the cryptocurrency will decouple from stocks.  Market Moves: Short-bitcoin investment products assets under management rose to $172 million last week, the highest on record, prompting some profit-taking with the first outflow in seven weeks totaling $5.1 million.  Chart of the Day: The U.S. longer-duration Treasury notes now offer 4% yield, which makes risky assets look less attractive to investors.  This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) regained ground Tuesday as equities remained weak, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closing down Monday. Some analysts are saying bitcoin has perhaps decoupled from broader financial markets that are on the downside, even if only briefly.  The U.K.'s pound recovered somewhat, as investors digested statements from the Bank of England. Bitcoin, after hitting lows of $18,500 over the weekend, is now trading above $20,000.  Over the last 24 hours, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market value is up 6%, according to CoinDesk data.  “Bitcoin’s recent bounce came a bit out of the blue and is reinforcing the decorrelation to equities we have seen very recently,” said Florian Giovannacci, head of trading at Covario AG.  “It was helped a bit by a weaker dollar, but for me, it shows the strong demand for BTC under $20k,” Giovannacci added. “This drop of correlation needs to be confirmed before speaking about decoupling.”  Unus sed leo (LEO), which is issued by iFinex, the parent company of crypto exchange Bitfinex, was up 7% on the day and is up 16% year to date. Matteo Bottacini, an analyst at Crypto Finance AG, said the year-to-date performance is “a result of great tokenomics.”  Uniswap (UNI) rallied by 17% on the day alongside gains for other altcoins.  In the news, crypto exchange FTX won the bidding war to buy the assets of bankrupt crypto broker Voyager Digital, Voyager said in a press release late Monday. FTX was bidding against Wave Financial, a digital-asset investment firm.  And, financial-services firm Galaxy Digital has teamed up with Chainlink Labs to bring crypto pricing data to blockchains.

Market Moves  Crypto Fund Inflows Totaled $8.3M Last Week: CoinShares  By Lyllah Ledesma  Digital-asset investment products witnessed inflows of $8.3 million last week, signaling investors’ appetite for digital assets continues to be tepid, according to data from CoinShares.  Short-bitcoin investment products assets under management rose to $172 million, the highest on record, prompting some profit-taking with the first outflow in seven weeks totaling $5.1 million.  Investors dipped into ethereum, which saw $7 million in inflows last week, the first week of net inflows for the token after the Ethereum blockchain’s software update called the Merge and following four weeks of outflows.  The recent launch of a short-ethereum investment product saw minor inflows of $1.1 million.  Chart of the Day  U.S. Long Bonds Offer 4% Yield  By Omkar Godbole  The U.S. longer-duration Treasury notes now offer 4% yield. That has massive implications for both traditional and crypto markets.  The 4% yield on the 10-year note makes equities less attractive. Meanwhile, investors who poured money into the dollar-pegged stablecoins early this year, may now liquidate their holdings and switch to the relatively risk-free Treasurys.  Stablecoins are risky compared with the Treasurys and may soon fall under the regulatory hammer.  Recently, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler reiterated that stablecoins need more regulation.  Meanwhile, a New York court asked Tether, the company behind the world's largest stablecoin tether (USDT) to prove 1-to-1 backing of its dollar-pegged cryptocurrency.

His remarks appear to urge some caution on those policymakers keen to rush into imposing rules in the wake of recent scandals exposed by the recent crypto crash, such as the collapse of the terraUSD (UST) algorithmic stablecoin, which used various mechanisms to help the coin maintain its peg.  “The DeFi winter … didn’t have significant effects on the banking system and broader financial stability” due to the lack of links between them, Powell told a panel.  “I think it demonstrates the weaknesses and the work that needs to be done around regulation, carefully and thoughtfully, and gives us a little bit of time,” he said. He added that it is central bankers who, as inflation risks began to materialize, may have inadvertently triggered the collapse of many DeFi initiatives.  “The monetary policy normalization that we’re seeing all over the world, all it did was reveal … significant structural issues in the DeFi system, and conflicts of interest,” Powell said. “All of those things have been revealed now that the tide has gone out.”  Powell said he favored applying the rules of conventional finance to DeFi, citing the mantra “same risks, same regulation” – but also to novel features such as replacing intermediaries with automated code, decentralized governance, and the use of unhosted crypto wallets to facilitate money laundering.  Powell also suggested he was in no rush to introduce a central bank digital currency, a digital form of public money which is under consideration in numerous jurisdictions across the world.  “We have not decided to proceed and we don't see ourselves as making that decision for some time,” Powell said, with the move requiring approval from both Congress and the executive branch. “We're evaluating both the policy issues and the technology issues and we're doing that with a very broad scope.”  His remarks follow a speech given by the European Commission’s Mairead McGuinness, who called for international coordination on applying new rules to both cryptocurrencies and DeFi.  “Decentralized finance ... challenges some of the fundamental aspects of the financial system as it currently exists,” said McGuinness, responsible for financial services at the EU’s executive arm. “The [European] Commission is monitoring the developments and risks in this fast-moving area very closely.”  Other central bankers were more frank about their skepticism.  “I don't see any redeeming value” in cryptocurrencies, said the Singapore Monetary Authority’s Ravi Menon. “Their time for reckoning has come.”  The European Central Bank’s Christine Lagarde said the collapse of terraUSD stablecoin – whose founder, Do Kwon, now appears to be the subject of an Interpol Red notice – showed the need to heap new rules on the sector.  Since emerging from the libertarian dream pushed by Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto, crypto has “been abused,” Lagarde said. “Mr. Do Kwon, who is on the run, is the other side of that enigmatic coin, which warrants the regulation that has been advocated by both Jay and Ravi.”  Kwon has denied he is on the run in a tweet sent last week, saying he was cooperating with the authorities.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | LUNA | REGULATION,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/27/us-fed-chair-powell-urges-caution-on-regulating-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7ac92cf678df75ccc53fa62b753dcf94f63a29bc-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The partnership will allow Betterment's 730,000 customers to access customized crypto investment plans based on their risk profiles and interests, starting next month. The curated crypto portfolios will be constructed from digital assets listed on Gemini, with the exchange serving as the custodian for the cryptocurrencies.  Marshall Beard, chief strategy officer at Gemini, said the service will help interested investors participate in the cryptocurrency market, where education about what cryptocurrencies are and how to invest in them is scarce.  ""Betterment is providing its users [with] education and access in a sophisticated way to allow them to access this crypto ecosystem without having to do it themselves,"" Beard told CoinDesk. ""It's breaking down that barrier of education because crypto is hard to engage with on your own.""  Jesse Proudman, vice-president of crypto investing at Betterment, said the tailored portfolio offering is geared toward investors looking to make longer-term investments in crypto.  ""By taking the burden of asset selection and the management of those assets off of clients, we allow people to step back and understand that they're investing in a sort of long-term portfolio here,"" Proudman told CoinDesk, adding, ""This is not a get-rich-quick scheme.""  Betterment's partnership with Gemini comes as the advisor gears up to launch its own cryptocurrency investment offering. In February, Betterment, acquired cryptocurrency robo-advisor startup Makara to facilitate the product launch.  The collaboration also comes as Gemini ramps up its efforts to forge agreements with various investment firms to serve as a custodian for their crypto funds.

Named the Robinhood Wallet, the Polygon-based wallet is opening its doors to the first 10,000 users who signed up for the testing period in May ahead of its public release.  Chief Technology Office Johann Kerbrat told CoinDesk the wallet will allow users to trade over 20 cryptocurrencies supported by decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator 0x, without fees. The wallet will also allow users to connect to dapps and earn yield on assets.  Robinhood has been steadily making advances in bolstering its crypto products and moving away from its original “walled garden” approach over the past year. In May, it opened its waitlist for the Web3 wallet’s beta, a month after it released its first crypto wallet to two million users.  Ahead of the wallet’s beta release, Robinhood listed USDC last week for traders. Kebrat said that part of the reason behind the listing was to coincide with the wallet’s release, since it will help onboard new users by offering a token that’s easier to trade without fears about volatility.

The initiative will improve bond markets’ efficiency on Umee’s Cosmos-, Ethereum-, Avalanche-, Near- and Solana-compatible trading platform.  Umee CEO and co-founder Brent Xu told CoinDesk that the DeFi space doesn’t yet offer a yield curve equivalent to the one that exists in traditional financial markets. To onboard the traditional finance sector into DeFi, UDX’s yield curve will help create asset specific interest rate structures.  Umee has been expanding its DeFi hub by acquiring almost $40 million in funds over the past 15 months. In June 2021, it raised $6.3 million in seed funding to begin building out its Cosmos and Ethereum bridge protocol. In December, it raised $32 million in a token sale before its mainnet launched in February.  Xu told CoinDesk its DAO structure will distribute funds through its native Cosmos SDK governance that creates loans though specific chains.  “The chain will act as a public ledger of the health of the loan in the same way that quarterly statements show the financial health of the company,” said Xu. “This provides a way to optimize the monitoring and viability of the financial health of the loan itself.""",POSITIVE,없음,ATOM | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/27/defi-hub-umee-targets-tradfi-with-institutional-lending-dao,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/72641dd356b28c5c794346916c1396d220a512d0-1331x998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

CBDCs at the wholesale level attract less attention than their headline-grabbing retail equivalent, he added.  One venture will look to improve CBDCs' liquidity management in decentralized finance (DeFi) – such as via automated market makers – which would play a role equivalent to that of investment banks that seek to sustain trading in a particular security, de Galhau said.  Another project will focus on issuing and distributing tokenized bonds on a blockchain, he said, building on previous findings about CBDCs being used to settle Web3 securities, such as the French central bank’s Project Jura.  Further details will be detailed in the coming weeks, he promised.  The European Central Bank is considering whether to issue a digital euro as soon as 2026, de Galhau said.

42373729,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvUzGZ,1664278438,Japan to Toughen Remittance Rules to Fight Money Laundering Using Crypto: Report,"The Japanese government is planning to introduce new rules for remittances directed at stopping criminals from using cryptocurrency exchanges to launder money, according to a Nikkei report.  The rules will require exchanges to share customer information – including customers' names and addresses – when they transfer crypto between platforms.  The move is intended to provide Japanese authorities additional monitoring capabilities to track money transfers by people engaged in illegal activities. Violators could face corrective orders or criminal penalties, according to the report.  Japan's Act on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds will be amended to include the new remittance rules. A draft amendment to the law will be submitted to a parliamentary session scheduled for Oct. 3 but the rules are expected to take effect in May 2023, the report said.  Japan's cryptocurrency exchanges have been in negotiations with the government about sharing customer information since last March, when Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) ordered exchanges to implement a framework to fulfill the travel rule, which encapsulates the recommended anti-money laundering norms for crypto by global standard-setter Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Exchanges have noted concerns about heavy compliance costs.  The law will also apply to stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the price of another asset – like the U.S. dollar or gold – to stabilize the price.  The report comes as the Japanese yen slides relentlessly against the dollar. The yen fell to a 24-year low of 145.90 per dollar earlier this week.  Sharp currency devaluations often have domestic investors scurrying to park money in overseas assets via cryptocurrencies.

The firm has about 20 million customers worldwide and offers exposure to about 80 crypto assets,  Revolut had previously offered crypto buying, selling and trading in the U.K under the FCA's temporary registration regime, or TRR, which was set up to allow firms to continue to operate while their applications were being reviewed.  When the deadline for approval passed at the end of March, the FCA allowed a select number of firms to remain on the TRR where it was ""strictly necessary."" As of early April, Revolut was one of five firms on TRR, along with CEX.I0, Copper Technologies, GlobalBlock and Moneybrain. None of the other four firms has subsequently been approved.  “We confirm that Revolut has been removed from the temporary register and has received full registration as a crypto-asset firm,"" an FCA spokesperson told CoinDesk via email.  Revolut didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.  “Revolut has agreed to a number of directions designed to ensure it has the systems and controls to meet the requirements of the money-laundering regulations,"" the FCA official said.  The FCA became the U.K.'s anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism-financing authority at the start of 2020. Crypto-asset firms were thereafter required to register for approval to offer their services in the U.K. More than 100 firms applied with 38 (including Revolut) approved.  In August, Revolut won authorization to offer its services across the European Economic Area via registration with the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission. The U.K. therefore represented something of a final frontier to winning regulatory approval for its crypto services in Europe.

42373723,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvUzAH,1664276996,S. Korean Authorities Look to Freeze $67M Bitcoin Tied to Terra's Do Kwon,"Authorities in South Korea have requested crypto exchanges OKX and KuCoin to freeze some 3,313 bitcoin (BTC), worth around $67 million, tied to Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon, CoinDesk Korea reported on Tuesday.  The bitcoin was transferred to digital wallets of the exchanges shortly after an arrest warrant was issued for Kwon in South Korea on Sept. 14, according to the report. Authorities accused the crypto entrepreneur of violating the country's securities laws and issued the warrant just months after the collapse of the $40 billion Terra ecosystem, which triggered a market downturn and the collapse of other major players in the industry.  While Kwon has maintained he is not on the run, South Korean authorities had asked Interpol for assistance in locating him. On Monday, Interpol put out a Red Notice, which is a request to law enforcement around the world to locate and provisionally arrest Kwon pending extradition, surrender or similar legal action.  Blockchain data analytics platform CryptoQuant says a digital wallet for the Luna Foundation Guard (a nonprofit set up in Singapore to promote Terra's growth) was ""suddenly"" created on crypto exchange Binance on Sept. 15. In the three days that followed, 3,313 BTC were transferred to KuCoin and OKX. In the months before Terra collapsed, the Luna Foundation Guard bought around $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin to beef up the reserves for its stablecoin UST.  While KuCoin has frozen some 1354 BTC ($27 million) transferred to the platform, OKX is allegedly ""ignoring the prosecution's request to freeze assets"" according to the article.  ""OKX can confirm that it has received a request from the Korean authorities, and that it is cooperating with their investigation,"" a spokesperson told CoinDesk following the publication of this article.  A spokesperson for KuCoin said it is ""willing to cooperate with any global law enforcement agencies when it comes to cases of investigations pertaining to the origin and freezing of suspected assets.""  Meanwhile, Do Kwon denied ""cashout"" allegations in a tweet.  Read more: Interpol Issues Red Notice for Do Kwon: Report  UPDATE (Sept. 28, 06:25 UTC): Adds comment from KuCoin and Do Kwon.

For instance, the native community of Bancor, an Ethereum-based decentralized exchange, is voting on a proposal to destroy a significant chunk of the protocol's endemic coin, the bancor network token (BNT), in the hope that the so-called token burn will bode well for the cryptocurrency's price.  ""DAO [decentralized autonomous organization] members have cited the fact that 'burns' have a psychological effect on market participants and the same can happen if such an experiment is allowed to be carried out,"" according to the proposal, which opened for voting for vBNT holders on Sept. 25. ""For this reason, this proposal is seeking a one-time burn of 1 million BNT when this amount has accumulated in the Bancor [version]3 vault.""  The proposal adds that the DAO will push for more token burns if the proposed measure has the desired effect on BNT's price. vBNT is the governance token issued to users who stake BNT in Bancor liquidity pools.  Token burn is a mechanism to remove a certain number of coins from circulation, thereby skewing demand-supply factors in favor of price appreciation. Early this month, the luna classic (LUNC) token surged on expectations of a community-approved plan to reduce the cryptocurrency's hyper-inflated supply. Dominant crypto exchange Binance destroys a significant chunk of its native cryptocurrency, BNB, every quarter.  The voting on Bancor's token burn proposal is set to expire on Sept. 28. At press time, 99% of votes favored destroying BNT once the total amount collected by the Bancor Vortex in the v3 vault reached 1 million.  The Bancor Vortex, launched early last year, collects a protocol-wide administration fee from liquidity providers. In version 2, the vortex collected fees in various tokens, which were then exchanged for BNT. The BNT was then used to buy and burn vBNT, ultimately reducing the circulating supply of BNT.  However, the v3 unveiled early this year simplified the process, removing the need to collect fees in different tokens and allowing the fees to be immediately swapped for BNT continuously, according to The TIE research.  At press time, the vortex vault held around 860,000 BNT tokens. The proposal estimates that the tally could rise to 1 million in the next 30 days.  The BNT token, susceptible to inflation, changed hands at 46 cents at press time, having peaked above $9 during the height of the crypto bull run in April 2021, CoinDesk data show. As of writing, BNT's circulating supply was 198.85 million.",POSITIVE,LUNC | BNB,EXCHANGE | LUNC | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/27/decentralized-exchange-bancor-proposes-burning-1-million-bnt-tokens-to-support-prices,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ef00ba19f2f8ed2abd154a14fc7b1016c4888c17-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422253,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0jR3h,1664272800,Solar-Powered Bitcoin Miner Aspen Creek Raises $8M Despite Bear Market,"A new solar powered bitcoin miner, Aspen Creek Digital Corp. (ACDC), raised $8 million in a Series A funding, led by crypto financial services company Galaxy Digital and blockchain investment firm Polychain Capital.  The miner will use the proceeds for its second Texas mining facility,which will have 30 megawatts (MW) of mining capacity and be co-located with an 87MW solar farm, the company’s CEO Alexandra DaCosta told CoinDesk. The facility is on track to be operational later this fall.  The funding comes as bitcoin miners struggle to survive the bear market caused by macroeconomic uncertainty , which has led to narrowing profit margins and a spike in energy costs. Most recently one of the largest bitcoin mining data centers, Compute North, filed for bankruptcy, citing crypto winter, supply-chain issues and trouble dealing with its biggest lender.  Additionally, investors are shying away from capital intensive crypto businesses such as bitcoin miners, making capital raises difficult. However, ACDC was able to secure the funding by using the “power first” approach, in which the company secured power and infrastructure first for its mining operations before looking to raise money – a contrast from what some other miners have done.  “We weren't the only bitcoin mining company that was looking to raise, but our model was different [than others],” DaCosta said. “A lot of the headwinds that we were seeing in the capital markets actually made our investors more interested in our story,” she noted, adding that ACDC’s approach allowed the company to control mining power costs.  “When investors saw the markets reeling from the run up in energy prices, the fall in the price of bitcoin, and how exposed a mining company can be – those dynamics actually made our story go from a PowerPoint to real life,” Da Costa added.  ACDC’s use of renewable energy and ability to sell excess power back to the grid particularly attracted Polychain Capital. “We’re excited to partner with ACDC as they build out more long-term, fixed-cost renewable energy production to enable more predictable Bitcoin mining operations, while providing the flexibility to sell excess power opportunistically into volatile energy markets,” PolychainCapital founder Olaf Carlson-Wee, said. “It’s great to witness Bitcoin’s ability to incentivize renewable power production at scale, and we think ACDC is at the forefront of these efforts,” he added.  In August, Polychain Capital also invested in a Berkeley Calif.-based company, Vespene Energy, that converts methane gas released from landfills into power for bitcoin mining.  ACDC, which was founded in January, started its operations in June at a 6 megawatt (MW) solar-powered facility in the western part of Colorado and co-located at a solar farm that has a mining capacity of 10MW. Meanwhile, Galaxy allocated some of its own miners to be hosted at ACDC’s first facility.  The mining company didn’t disclose its valuation with the new raise, but Da Costa said she is happy with the numbers, given the tough funding market. “What mattered to us was being able to raise funds to keep our project pipeline on track,” she said.  She added that rather than the valuation she was more focused on forging relationships with strategic investors who can help the company grow.  The company also has a third project in the pipeline, which will have 150MW mining capacity and be co-located with a 200MW solar farm. The facility is also located in Texas and expected to come online next summer.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/27/solar-powered-bitcoin-miner-aspen-creek-raises-8m-despite-bear-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/28ebb8a3281dcab10938c1c4c1fa2e40884b2616-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The ADA price action shows a bullish reversal possibility within a triangle pattern leading to a price jump to the trendline. Currently, the Cardano price action on the technical chart offers the case of a double bottom reversal contesting the 50-day EMA. So should you consider buying Cardano as the prices sustain above $0.43? Key Points: The Cardano prices show a bull cycle challenging the 50-day EMA.

Furthermore, the ADA price action displays a 3.13% jump leading to a bullish engulfing candle. The bullish candle helps form a morning star pattern that may shortly lead to a positive turnaround within the triangle pattern. However, the reversal rally faces opposition from the 50-day EMA while the trend in trading volume declines. Hence, the recovery rally shows an underlying weakness which may fail to exceed the 50-day EMA, leading to higher price rejection.

The top cryptocurrency by market value rose over 5% to $20,350, according to CoinDesk data. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, rose 4% to $1,390.  The uptick follows a period of uncanny resilience to turmoil in traditional markets. Bitcoin traded between $18,000 to $20,000 in the past five days even as major fiat currencies like the British pound, Japanese yen and Chinese yuan dropped sharply against the U.S. dollar.  The pound, in particular, fell to an all-time low of $1.035 on Monday as the government's plan to implement the biggest tax cuts in 50 years while boosting government borrowing and spending amid high inflation spooked investors. The Chinese yuan fell to 7 per dollar, the lowest since May 2020, triggering fears of a rout in global commodities.  If that's not enough, the S&P 500, Wall Street's benchmark index, ended Monday at its lowest level of 2022, extending the past week's 4.5% slide. The Dow dropped more than 300 points on Monday, finishing in bear market territory.  Bitcoin has historically moved more or less in lockstep with stocks. So, the cryptocurrency's latest resilience has raised hopes of its eventual evolution as a safe haven asset.  However, it may be too early to conclude that the cryptocurrency has permanently decoupled from traditional markets.  The S&P 500 futures rose 0.7% early Tuesday, perhaps helping bitcoin cross above $20,000. The dollar index, which gauges the greenback's value against major currencies, fell 0.46% to 113.58.  “The U.S. dollar is a mega bubble,"" Charlie Morris, chief investment officer at ByteTree Asset Management, said.

Currently, on the technical chart, the Ripple prices face a descending supply slope, challenging the breakout rally as it crosses the $0.50 psychological mark. So should you consider buying Ripple as the prices rest at the 200-day EMA? Key Points: The Ripple prices show a bull cycle reaching the 200-week EMA.

42422255,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0jR5h,1664262000,"Bitcoin Mining's Sustainable Electricity Mix May Be Declining, Says Cambridge University Research Organization","Cambridge University's Centre for Alternative Finance's (CCAF) latest research into bitcoin mining suggests the mix of sustainable electricity used is in decline.  The CCAF, which is part of the Cambridge Judge Business School, uses publicly available data to run a theoretical model to estimate the environmental footprint of bitcoin mining. It does this by breaking down its electricity mix and calculating its greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) emission intensity per kilowatt-hour (gCO2e/kWh).  It found that emissions intensity for 2021 was 506.71 gCO2e/kWh, compared to 491.24 in 2020. Data for this year is so far only available up to January, so no conclusions can yet be drawn for 2022 for the time being.  CCAF's bitcoin mining data tools  Since 2019, the CCAF's Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI) has provided a daily estimate of the amount of electricity used by bitcoin mining globally. Additionally, its Mining Map, rolled out in 2020, is used to visualize the geographical distribution of mining activities.  Now the CCAF has combined the two elements to estimate greenhouse gas emissions attributable to bitcoin more fully. While electricity consumption is an important factor, it does not take into account the differing electricity sources that power mining from one country to the next, and how these different countries' relative shares of the global hashrate vary over time.  The uptick in fossil fuel emission intensity in bitcoin mining from 2020 to 2021 could be attributed to a collapse in the share conducted using hydropower since the crackdown on the industry in China last year. In 2020, the CCAF found that China accounted for 65% of the world's total hashrate, with the majority of mining activity there powered by either hydropower (33.7%) or coal (40.4%). Hydropower's share in 2021, however, was down to 18.5%, with coal's reduced slightly to 38.2%.  The CCAF concludes that 37.6% of electricity used by bitcoin miners comes from sustainable sources, compared to 62.4% from fossil fuels. This figure is at odds with that provided by the Bitcoin Mining Council, which says 59% of the electricity used by the industry comes from sustainable sources.  Governments, regulators and others frequently cite the energy-intensive nature of proof-of-work bitcoin mining as one of the main flaws in the world's largest cryptocurrency, with some taking a proactive stance toward attempting to curtail it.  Earlier this month, the White House Office for Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) published a report on bitcoin mining, calling for more research so that federal agencies can minimize harm on the environment and electricity grids.  Furthermore, ether's recent ""Merge"" from a proof-of-work model to the less energy-intensive proof-of-stake, with claims that it will make it 99% more energy efficient, put further pressure on bitcoin's mining mechanism.

FTX was bidding against Wave Financial, a digital-asset investment firm.  Voyager Token (VGX) rose after the announcement, gaining 3.76% as of 04:17 UTC, trading around 76 U.S. cents.  Crypto lender Voyager Digital filed for bankruptcy in July. Industry observers had been increasing their scrutiny of Voyager’s business practices, particularly how the Canadian-listed firm said in marketing materials that investors' deposits were protected by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance.  While FDIC insurance would indeed protect bank-held cash deposits up to $250,000, it would not cover cash converted to stablecoins. According to writer Frances Coppola, Voyager’s loan book accounted for nearly half of its total assets, and nearly 60% of that loan book was composed of loans to Three Arrows, which filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy, also in July.  CoinDesk was first to report on Sept. 16 that FTX was in the lead to buy Voyager's assets.

On the last day, XLM lost more than 6% of its market value. Stellar has recorded positive price sentiment recently, owing to an update that spread optimism across the XLM community. In the latest update, Stellar users can now transfer USDC and Stellar Lumens via email. Despite the update, technical indicators have sided with the bears on the one-day chart. The buying power has fallen considerably, even though the number of buyers is greater compared to the number of sellers. In the last week, Stellar price went up close to 7%. However, at press time, the bulls look exhausted. The present support zone for XLM stands between $0.111 and $0.106, respectively. A fall from the $0.106 mark will lead the Stellar price to touch the $0.99 price mark. Broader market support will be necessary for most altcoins to recover. If buyers don&apos;t pick up momentum and XLM doesn&apos;t topple above the 20-SMA, then the altcoin is in for a further drop in price.

The price of the altcoin continues to totter near the $0.47 price mark. The bears seem to be back on the charts for XRP. Over the last 24 hours, the XRP price fell by 4.12%. On the other hand, the coin has rallied by over 30% in the past week. The technical indicators of the altcoin also started to paint bearish price action on the one-day chart. The bulls have lost steam in the past week owing to an increase in selling strength in the market. The indicators have yet to move into the excess selling zone, but the major technical outlook indicated that the buyers were leaving the market.

Cryptos Rise Even as Stocks Suffer  By James Rubin  Bitcoin and ether inched upward in Monday trading, countering equity markets that closed lower but remaining in the same narrow bands they've occupied for more than a week.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading above $19,200, a more than 2% gain over the past 24 hours. BTC has been tangoing with the $19,000 threshold for eight days, dipping and rising according to the winds of the latest economic indicators.  Ether was recently changing hands over its most recent support of $1,300, a more than 2% increase from the previous day. Most other major cryptos were largely in the green, with DOT and BSV recently up more than 6% and 5%, respectively.  ""Crypto markets are holding up quite well in the face of everything that's going on globally,"" Nauman Sheikh, managing director at Wave Financial, told CoinTV's ""First Mover"" program.  Stocks  Equity markets, from which crypto prices have drawn their lead for much of the year, closed lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and S&P 500 both falling over a percentage point and the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropping 0.6%. The declines came amid investors' heightened recessionary fears that took root following a wave of hawkish interest rate hikes and economic data pointing firmly downward. The DJIA tumbled into bear market territory, meaning it has declined at least 20% from its previous peak.  On Monday, yields for two-year U.S. Treasurys soared to 4.3%, reaching levels last seen in August 2007. Ten-year notes topped 3.9%, their highest mark since 2010. An inverted yield curve suggests that investors are placing a higher degree of risk on short-term than longer-term lending, and historically has foreshadowed recessions that affect all risk assets. Cryptocurrencies typically move in the opposite direction of yields.  Earlier in the day, markets were further roiled when the British pound fell to a historic low against the U.S. dollar before rallying. The drop occurred after the British government introduced its largest tax cuts in a half century to spur economic growth, but raising fresh inflation concerns.  Crypto news offered a mix of events, negative, neutral and positive. The search for Do Kwon intensified following Interpol's Red Notice asking law enforcement agencies worldwide to find and arrest the Terraform Labs co-founder, pending extradition, surrender or similar legal action.  Australia said it would complete its central bank digital currency by 2023 and Walmart, the world's largest retailer, announced a major non-fungible token (NFT) initiative. The Walt Disney Company separately hinted at a ramped-up metaverse presence through a recent job listing for a principal counsel specializing in non-fungible tokens and decentralized finance (DeFi).  Despite the ongoing, macroeconomic turbulence, Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at crypto fund manager Arca, took issue with ""the convenient narrative"" that ties ""digital assets' fates to macro."" In his Two Satoshis newsletter, Dorman wrote that the correlation was ""short-lived"" and applied only to bitcoin and ""a few other bellwether cryptocurrencies.""  ""The future success or failure of digital asset investments will be more closely tied to user and app growth than to dot plots,"" he wrote, adding: ""But with the Ethereum Merge in the rear-view mirror and the Federal Reserve stranglehold transparently and clearly stated, what will be the next catalyst to drive digital asset prices? To answer that, we must acknowledge how bad the data is and compare it to data points suggesting trends may reverse soon.""

Token2049 is in town, followed by the Formula 1 race. Despite the bear market for crypto, organizers say there are over 7,000 people scheduled to attend and 2,000 companies represented.  Hotel prices are up nearly 70% from last year with the highest prices per night in a decade as visitors flock back to a Singapore free of COVID-19 restrictions. The event, which features developers and executives from leading Web3 and other blockchain-related companies, underscores not only the global return to normality but also Singapore’s resurgence as a crypto hub and business hub. It also highlights the different roads that Singapore and its perennial rival, Hong Kong, which is playing catch-up, have been traveling.  Singapore re-opened its borders and dropped most COVID-19 restrictions in March 2022. Hong Kong is now only doing so this month, perhaps egged on by its loss of the title of top financial hub in Asia to Singapore.  Another loss for Hong Kong is the Token2049 conference itself. Initially, this event was a London and Hong Kong affair until it was canceled twice in Hong Kong because of pandemic restrictions.  This year’s Singapore Fintech Festival and Hong Kong Fintech Week are actually scheduled to be overlapping events. But as CoinDesk has previously reported, these might be two different events entirely.  Hong Kong Fintech week is less about fintech and more about govtech: how financial technology can help Hong Kong and its firms be more efficient for Beijing’s vision of the ""Greater Bay Area,"" the future tight integration of Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Macau, along with several regional mainland cities. Singapore’s festival, in contrast, is a much more international affair, judging by the speakers’ list.  Besides, anyone from overseas who wants to go to Hong Kong’s Fintech Week needs to arrive three days early as the current rules say no “maskless or group activities” (including restaurants and bars) for 72 hours. And there’s a required PCR test at the airport, and three more spread out during the first week.  Not much fun for conference goers.
