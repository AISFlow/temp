Early returns – for an ""onshore"" $22 million fund and its Cayman-domiciled $10 million sibling – reveal a small but deep-pocketed clientele participated in the twin funds' earliest days. Just five total investors have joined the funds since Galaxy unveiled them in late January.      The funds debuted as ETH settled in the $1,500 range, well below highs set February when the native asset of the world computer topped $2,000 for the first time ever. But Galaxy's executives, including ETH bull Mike Novogratz, are betting Ethereum's programmability will spell future investment success.      ""Bitcoin has solidified its lane as a store of value in which we continue to have conviction, while the Ethereum blockchain’s general programmability presents a distinct growth opportunity,"" Galaxy's asset management chief, Steve Kurz, told CoinDesk in January. ""We’re excited to help our clients participate in that potential upside as a complement to bitcoin.""

42433852,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP5ihh,1614979672,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Stuck Below $50K, and Blockchain Data May Show Why","Bitcoin ended the first week of March with little fanfare as the market reset after the prior week’s 21% plunge. There are more signs the global economic recovery might come faster than previously expected, and traders are speculating on what that might mean for the largest cryptocurrency.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $49,196.78 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Climbing 1.93% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $46,393.39-$49,462.13 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC trades above its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.    This week’s muted price activity in bitcoin showed in the trading volume from eight U.S.-focused exchanges CoinDesk tracks. It has been flat over the past week, roughly a third of levels seen recently.      “Bitcoin is consolidating around $50,000 after rebounding from lows earlier in the week,” Jason Lau, chief operating officer at San Francisco-based crypto exchange OKCoin, said. “Most recently, its price action has been hovering within this range, while open interest in bitcoin futures has also remained consistent.”      $50,000 also appears to be a key short-term resistance level, according to IntoTheBlock’s newsletter Friday, citing a key blockchain data metric In/out of the money around price (IOMAP).      “A large cluster of addresses (1.46 million) and volume (650,970 BTC) had been bought slightly below $50,000,” IntoTheBlock wrote in the newsletter. “This price range, which already saw high levels of trading activity, is expected to act as strong resistance short-term as investors in this price range may look to break-even on their positions at this point.”      At the same time, another large cluster of addresses and volume, bought in a range of $45,600 to $47,000 currently at the money, are likely to provide strong support, IntoTheBlock’s data shows.      “Ultimately, a break past $45,000 may mean bitcoin will retrace further, while a breakout past $50,000 may suggest it is poised for new highs,” IntoTheBlock added. “These are the levels to watch out for before being certain of the correction being over or not.”      Investors will also have to weigh macro factors including a better-than-expected February job report in the U.S., as well as surging bond yields.      Read More: How Bitcoin Could Be Affected by February’s Positive Jobs Report    Ether underperforms bitcoin, market watches July hard fork    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up a little on Friday, trading around $1,534.25 and in the green 0.11% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      At press time, ether’s price was down approximately 25% from its all-time high at $2,036.55 on Feb. 19. That’s a steeper drop-off than bitcoin 17% retreat from a record $58,332.36 on Feb. 21.      The main reason ether has been underperforming “is that high ether prices are detrimental to Ethereum's primary use case as a smart contract platform, making transactions extremely costly and resulting in activity moving to other platforms,” said OKCoin’s Lau.      As CoinDesk reported, Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 is scheduled to take effect in July – regardless of the mining industry’s discontent with the proposal – with the goal of fixing part of Ethereum’s high transaction cost problem.

42433840,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP5iRh,1614979567,"Sen. Sherrod Brown Says US Should ‘Lead the Way’ on CBDCs, Disses Diem and Bitcoin","The U.S. Federal Reserve should “lead the way” on a central bank digital currency (CBDC), said Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio).      The chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs endorsed the idea of a U.S. central bank–issued digital currency in a letter to Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Lael Brainard, who runs the Boston branch of the Fed.      “Some of our international counterparts are moving quickly to determine whether to implement a central bank digital currency,” Brown wrote, linking to a press release about a digital euro. “The United States must do the same. We cannot be left behind.”      Importantly, Brown specified the Fed should work both on token-based digital dollars as well as account-based efforts. Last year, he introduced a bill to the Senate Banking committee that would create a digitized version of the existing U.S. dollar and grant every U.S. resident financial access through so-called FedAccounts.      In this week’s letter, dated March 1 but shared on Friday, Brown suggested that a token-based dollar based on a blockchain could complement the FedAccount version.      “Both are intended to ensure that working families have the same access to the payments system as Wall Street banks and wealthy corporations,” he wrote. “The Federal Reserve’s recent publication outlining the goals for a central bank digital currency is a step in the right direction.”      He went further, writing that the Fed and the Treasury Department should “establish a concrete timetable in deciding whether to implement a CBDC.”      However, any digital dollar should address consumer protection, financial access, security and individual privacy concerns, he said.      He referenced private efforts, like the Facebook-initiated diem stablecoin project, warning that efforts by technology companies could exploit the very people they claim to want to help.      “The Fed must not stop at regulating a privately issued digital currency. It must go further and explore a publicly issued digital dollar,” Brown wrote.      The digital dollar debate exploded into the congressional scene last year, when various bills introduced in both the Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives sought to find more efficient ways of sending funds to U.S. residents.      None of these efforts went anywhere, but research by the U.S. central bank expanded last year. Brainard announced the Boston Fed was looking into a digital dollar through a joint research project with the MIT Digital Currency Initiative.      More recently, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Nominee Rohit Chopra said the Fed should accelerate its efforts to build a modernized real-time payments system, though he didn't specifically reference CBDCs.      In his letter, Brown warned that private efforts like bitcoin could undermine the dollar.      “The potential for non-sovereign crypto-assets, like bitcoin, to become more widely used as a payment mechanism, poses significant monetary policy and financial stability risks, including risk to our climate,” he wrote. “They are highly volatile and speculative, can be used for illegal activity, and consume incredible amounts of energy, driving up electricity use rates, and putting the resilience of local grids at risk.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | SPONSORED | RESEARCH,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/03/05/sen-sherrod-brown-says-us-should-lead-the-way-on-cbdcs-disses-diem-and-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2456b62a732d2cfb28b05cee9502ea0068fa4ba4-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433839,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP5iPh,1614978385,"Soaring Prices for Enjin, FLOW and Rarible Reveal Risks of 'NFT Marketplace' Tokens","A $6.6 million digital token representing an animated clip of a graffiti-covered Donald Trump lying face down in the grass. A $1 million batch of 34 “digital collectibles” known as CryptoPunks. A $69,000 dogecoin-inspired digital token representing a pixelated cat image.      The price tags for these “non-fungible tokens,” or NFTs, might seem daunting, inaccessible or downright ridiculous to the average person.      That's why some cryptocurrency traders, rather than buying NFTs directly, are buying digital tokens affiliated with the marketplaces that have popped up for trading NFTs. This way traders can bet on the NFT industry’s growth without having to go all-in on some sky-high priced digital artwork or trading card.      Investors think these tokens “can serve, in a way, as index bets on the growth of the NFT marketplaces they power,” said Alex Gedevani, research analyst at Delphi Digital.    NFT frenzy    According to Messari, a data provider for cryptocurrency markets, the 10 biggest digital tokens that are associated with NFT platforms have returned in a year-to-date price range from about 60% to 900%.      The FLOW token, of the Dapper Labs-backed Flow blockchain, which powers the digital collectibles platform NBA Top Shot, is up 79% just in the past seven days to a market capitalization of $1.1 billion, according to CoinGecko. (Last week, some 10,631 packs of basketball videos hashed to the Flow blockchain sold for a record $1.05 million.)      And in a sign of just how frenzied the trading action has become, the ENJ token, from a startup company called Enjin, shot up 50% to surpass a market valuation of $1 billion. CoinDesk reported that Enjin planned to roll out two new product offerings focused on NFTs. ENJ is listed on big cryptocurrency exchanges including Binance and FTX, and there’s even derivatives contracts that can be used to bet on the price.      The outsize price gains offer a reminder of just how speculative cryptocurrency markets have historically been, with fast profits possible alongside steep risks.      “Since NFTs are going through a hype cycle, that naturally raises the price of assets similarly associated with NFTs,” Mason Nystrom, research analyst at Messari, told CoinDesk. “We've seen this happen in previous cycles with Ethereum competitors, decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens, and so this type of market reaction is pretty common.”      Even some NFT industry executives are agog at how rapidly the token prices are zooming. They characterize the binge as partly driven by a fear of missing out, or FOMO. For instance, the WAX token, WAXP, has tripled this year to a market value of $175 million.      “It starts with the consumers or the token holders being uneducated about how the growth in the NFT ecosystem is going to benefit different blockchains, and which blockchains are going to benefit the most,” said William Quigley, co-founder of Worldwide Asset eXchange, an NFT marketplace. “So if you're not doing that kind of work, you're really just randomly throwing money based on the press releases you've read.”    Rationalizing the pump    Most NFTs are digital tokens created atop the Ethereum blockchain network under special-purpose standards known as ERC-721 or ERC-1155. Because they’re unique, their value is more subjective and their worth is in the eye of the beholder.      The platform tokens, by contrast, use the more common ERC-20 or other similar token standards on non-Ethereum blockchains. They’re more widely distributed and traded, so their fair value is determined by the market. Many of them are listed on exchanges so the pricing is more transparent.      What are they? That requires more research. They might seem like stocks in a company but they’re really more akin to in-house “utility” tokens that might benefit from increased trading volumes on a given platform, or as “governance tokens” that might offer holders a say in the rules of the marketplace and, perhaps eventually, a share of the payouts.      Read More: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?      For example, both Rarible’s RARI and WAX’s WAX tokens are governance tokens for the respective NFT trading platforms, where token holders can earn rewards from trading fees while voting for the platform’s upgrades. Enjin’s ENJ, on the other hand, is a utility token of Enjin, which requires ENJ as collateral to issue new fungible or non-fungible items on the gaming platform.      From an investor’s perspective, evaluating individual NFTs such as CryptoPunks – collectible characters with proof of ownership stored on the Ethereum blockchain – requires experience and knowledge, said Nystrom at Messari. Collectibles, sports – one has to know what one is getting into.      Investing in NFTs “requires an investor to be precisely right – similar to betting that a bitcoin payment company will succeed – rather than just directionally correct like betting bitcoin will succeed,” Nystrom added.      Read More: Single Buyer Splurges $1M in Ether on CryptoPunk Digital Collectibles      With many of these tokens being built on ERC-20 token standard, they also offer much more liquidity, and as a result, “it is much more accessible for larger capital allocators rather than NFTs,” according to Delphi’s Gedevani.    Risks rise as prices skyrocket    “It's important to be cautious as NFTs are an early-stage asset class and things are getting frothy,” Gedevani said. “There's a lot of NFT issuance that will be coming onto the market going forward.”      With the skyrocketing appreciation of many of these tokens, the pressure of any near-term sell-off is also high.      Flow, for example, has a very low circulating supply, with many investors having bought the token at a very low price.      “We'll likely see some short-term sell-off once tokens start vesting especially considering both institutional and retail investors are up many multiples since they had really low initial purchase prices – $0.1 per Flow – in some instances like the CoinList Auction,” Nystrom said.",POSITIVE,ENJ | FLOW,ENJ | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING | FLOW,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/05/soaring-prices-for-enjin-flow-and-rarible-reveal-risks-of-nft-marketplace-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/95953a71ed4ba3975c447e359512dc40b59fc60f-1500x1257.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Leuthold Group manages $1 billion but regulatory barriers prevent the firm from holding cryptocurrency.  “What I like about bitcoin is … its correlation to stocks and other assets is extraordinarily independent,” Paulsen told Reuters.  In lieu of holding the asset itself, wealth managers are clamoring for the approval of bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that would meet the legal standards required of traditional investments, according to the report.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not ruled whether mutual funds can own cryptocurrency directly, according to Robert Jenkins, global head of research at Refinitiv Lipper.  The report comes as Wall Street players (and their clients) increasingly embrace bitcoin as an asset akin to gold.  BNY Mellon announced a crypto custody service last month; Goldman Sachs announced this week it was launching a cryptocurrency trading desk.  According to Jimmy Lee, CEO of Wealth Consulting Group, financial advisors are frustrated by not being able to manage crypto for their clients.

42386111,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBRISH,1614969065,"Money Reimagined: Crypto Speculation Is a Feature, Not a Bug","Welcome to Money Reimagined.      These past two weeks have seen some very big price swings in crypto markets as investors shift their outlook on U.S. interest rates. That’s driving authorities to speak disparagingly about the speculation that goes on in bitcoin and other tokens. In this week’s column, we take apart that “speculation” word and come out with a less ominous interpretation of what it means.      In this week’s “Money Reimagined” podcast episode, Sheila Warren and I talk to Serey Chea, director general at National Bank of Cambodia, and Makoto Takemiya, co-CEO of Tokyo-based blockchain technology provider Soramitsu, about Cambodia’s “Bakong” new central bank digital currency and payments system. It’s a fascinating look at how small economies can use such technology to leapfrog their otherwise underdeveloped financial systems into something far more advanced.      Have a listen after reading the newsletter.    Speculation is not a dirty word    Don’t look now, but I’m told there’s speculationgoing on in crypto markets.      Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde and U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren all recently called bitcoin a “highly speculative asset,” with the latter adding this week that it’s “going to end badly.” Bank of Canada Deputy Governor Tim Lane, commenting on the surge in cryptocurrency prices in early February, said it was “speculative mania.”      This puts these officials in bed with economist-turned-full-time crypto troll Nouriel Roubini, whose diatribes on this industry’s danger to humanity frequently cite the “S” word.    You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    It also aligns them with hedge fund billionaire Paul Singer, who in a Jan. 28 letter to his investors singled out the bitcoin “fraud” as the biggest of all bubbles in an investing market consumed with “head-smacking craziness.”      (Below we look at Singer, the Elliott Management founder, more closely. I’m not sure this “vulture investor” is the kind of company that an anti-Wall Street crusader like Warren would want to keep.)      But I digress.      Sssssspeculation.      The word invites allusions to tulips in 17th century Netherlands. It evokes images of innocent, Mom and Pop investors duped into buying at unsustainable hyped-up prices and losing it all. It signifies emptiness. Nothingness. Hot air. Fakery.      So, while it’s worth noting that both Yellen and Lagarde, to their credit, have also acknowledged the potential in crypto’s underlying technology, let’s recognize the message their language sends: that this industry, unlike traditional finance, is not to be trusted.      The truth is, well, yes, of course there’sspeculation in crypto. I’d say it’s currently the technology’s primary use case. But I’m here to tell you that’s not a bad thing. After all, in embracing speculation, crypto is engaging the central force of American capitalism.    The impossible conspiracy    The “speculation” language here fosters the impression of a clique of “in the know” actors who hoodwink everyone else, pumping up investments of no fundamental value, all so they can dump their holdings at the peak and leave the duped holding the bag.      If that’s the case, if it’s all a “fraud” as Singer says, then crypto would be the most complex pump-and-dump scheme in history. It would mean that over the past 12 years, tens of thousands of open-source developers have somehow conspired to create a giant public record of raucous debate over Twitter, GitHub and chat rooms, all to suggest that no one is in charge of an otherwise fully orchestrated operation.      It would also be the most egalitarian fraud in history. The Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance’s latest survey of worldwide crypto usage, conducted in spring 2020, when cryptocurrencies were at their lowest levels in two years, estimated there were 101 million distinct holders of crypto assets worldwide. Bitcoin has delivered them a 15x return since then. Are they all in on the fraud, too?      Contrast that with the exclusivity of Elliott Management’s winnings. Over the years, Singer’s hedge fund has earned payouts on bonds far and above their going market prices with strategies that, while legal, function much like extortion.      In 2016, Elliott exploited a favorable ruling from a judge – not in a Buenos Aires court but in New York – to turn a 2004 bet of $117 million on a small subset of Argentina’s defaulted bonds into a $2 billion profit. For 12 years, it refused to participate in a global debt restructuring that the vast majority of creditors had accepted and, by using the judicial ruling to seize national assets, it denied Argentina access to the international capital it badly needed. The government eventually had to give in. A single U.S. hedge fund, with a few insiders behind it, had successfully demanded a ransom from 45 million Argentine hostages.      It’s in stories of rent extraction like this, not in gyrating crypto prices, that you find grand-scale manipulation in financial markets. On Wall Street, as Warren thundered after the 2008 financial crisis, they are so commonplace they are part of the system.      The power enjoyed by Wall Street’s too-big-to-fail investment banks and their hedge fund clients stems in large part from the dollar’s centrality in global debt markets and from the hold they have over government policy. That is the problem bitcoin and decentralized finance are trying to fix.    The speculation engine    So, let’s please drop the hyperbolic “fraud” language.      But let’s also give Yellen, Lagarde and Warren their due. Yes, of course, there’s speculation in crypto markets. No one could look at the price volatility and conclude otherwise.      But so what?      Speculation is the basis for a capitalist economy. Without it, we’d have central planning.      Speculation is what property developers do when they invest in up-and-coming neighborhoods. It’s what your insurer does when it promises to pay you if your house succumbs to fire. It’s what Silicon Valley’s venture capitalists do, day in, day out.      Speculation is the engine of American finance. Interest rates, that system’s foundational layer, arise from the mediation of a multitude of competing short- and long-term bond market investments, and from the arbitrage bets that straddle them, that are placed by major financial institutions. As explained by the economist and innovation theorist Carlota Perez, who spoke at CoinDesk’s Consensus conference last May, financial speculation also plays a vital role in amplifying the economy-wide waves of innovation that happen during periods of rapid technological change.      Crypto can now take both aspects of that speculation engine and apply it to a new model that’s free of rent-seeking intermediaries. It’s not clear how it will evolve, but our future financial system could well involve some combination of bitcoin as an underlying source of programmable collateral and decentralized finance (DeFi) as the governance framework for establishing credit, insurance, interest rates and payment systems.      For now, the difference between speculation in traditional markets and in crypto is that the former occurs in a more liquid, efficient environment. The arbitrage opportunities posed by price volatility tend to narrow more quickly, so prices are relatively more stable and more viable as reliable benchmarks.      In both markets, the process by which arbitrage gaps narrow is always ongoing, and it tends to be accelerated by a positive feedback loop between speculation and technology. On Wall Street, we saw this acutely in bond markets when electronic trading simultaneously boosted volumes and narrowed the bid-ask price spreads that banks charged.      In DeFi, the same is occurring only faster, with the breakneck innovation in DeFi. Speculators know that getting in on the ground floor now, before the technology evolves, will allow them to ride the future efficiency gains to profit. The more they enter, the more the incentive for innovators to perfect the technology, the more valuable the system becomes.      Speculation? Bring it on.    Wither ‘bither?’    Having just extolled the virtues of speculation in crypto, I’m going to add a caveat.      That is to say the current nature of the speculative activity, with investors hardly bothering to distinguish between assets, not only in crypto but also in broader markets, is less than ideal. The past week, in which the overall market mood shifted back and forth in response to rising U.S. bond yields and fears the Federal Reserve will move to tighten monetary policy, has left investors lumping anything other than dollars into “risk assets.” Whenever those interest rate concerns grew, everything from stocks to bonds to crypto assets fell (and rose when fears subsided.) This is a reflection of the all-encompassing dependency on the Fed’s quantitative easing policies that has developed over time.      This lack of nuance appears especially acute within crypto. It’s frustrating to see that investors looking for an outlet for their excess dollars treat digital assets such as bitcoin and ether as the same, as if the underlying technology behind Bitcoin and Ethereum is identical. The past week’s chart shows such a strong correlation that I can’t help describing a seemingly monolithic bitcoin-ether trade as “bither.”      Now, more than ever, Bitcoin and Ethereum should be differentiated. Bitcoin is establishing itself as a programmable store of a value, a reserve asset that’s described as “digital gold.” Ethereum is aspiring to be a universal protocol on which decentralized applications are built to enable new systems of value exchange and organizational structure. Their fortunes are obviously somewhat aligned, but they are very different projects.      Speculation is, as I argued, a necessary element of our financial system. But it works much more effectively when speculators make their bets based on expectations for differentiated assets. The issue may not be that there’s too much speculation in markets. It’s that the Fed made itself into the only subject of speculation that matters.    The conversation: Gladstein vs. Scott    For this week’s edition of “Coin Toss,” CoinDesk TV’s new weekly debate show moderated by Adam Levine, we stage a discussion between two people with passionate interests in human rights and financial inclusion but diametrically opposed views on bitcoin.      We pitted Brett Scott, a writer and activist who warns that cashless digital solutions hurt the poor and is highly critical of bitcoin’s deflationary qualities, among other issues, against Alex Gladstein, the Human Rights Foundation’s chief strategy officer, who is a vocal advocate of bitcoin for financial inclusion. The two went at it in a heated debate that you can watch here.      Scott said bitcoin is not money and that transactions involving it in return for goods or services are not “sales” but “counter-trades” intermediated real money, such as dollars. The lawyer Misha Guttentag said that argument was mere semantics:      After the show, Scott took up Guttentag’s request for elaboration:      Which prompted Gladstein to try to catch Scott in what he saw as an inconsistency:      But Scott was adamant:      And then it was on, with Gladstein calling Scott’s phrase that bitcoin is an “object priced in dollars,” as a “subjective definition [and] a purposefully diminutive one at that.” Scott said Gladstein couldn’t understand him because he was seeing everything through the “ideological tools of the crypto prophets,” who have a right-wing agenda that cares little for the financial inclusion and freedoms that Gladstein cherishes.      With both accusing each other of being captured by their own narrow definitions, it was never going to get resolved. So, the conversation raged for another 24 hours, drawing in a variety of figures on both sides of the Bitcoin divide.      These included Rohan Grey, the author of a widely criticized bill that proposed requiring stablecoin issuers to register as banks. He sided with Scott, tweeting this at Gladstein:      The conversation also drew in crypto fund manager Jacob Eliosoff, who shared Gladstein and Guttentag’s disdain for language games:      Things really got heated, eventually drawing in Bloomberg journalist Joe Weisenthal, who has become a big proponent of Modern Monetary Theory (the idea that, because governments control money, it’s impossible for them to run out):      In all, it was a classic Crypto Twitter melee. A lot of ego. Quite a bit of entertainment. Nothing resolved.

Institutional demand for bitcoin from investors and corporations has been a big driver of price gains over the past year: The cryptocurrency has gained 65% this year after quadrupling in 2020.      But this MicroStrategy effect might be wearing off, raising questions over what level of buying – or economic indicators – might be needed to spark a fresh rally, given the cryptocurrency's outsize gains already.      Bitcoin's price popped above $48,000 on Friday after MicroStrategy's announcement before quickly losing momentum. MicroStrategy's shares, meanwhile, were down by 11% at press time.      “In my view, bitcoin’s increasing reliance on purchase announcements for short rallies is not an entirely healthy trend,” said Hunain Naseer, senior editor at OKEx Insights, said.

42386112,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBRIR1,1614965513,"What Causes a Crypto Flash Crash? Sometimes, Business as Usual","Before last week's price crash really got underway, there was a brief crash in the price of ether on Tuesday, Feb. 22. The TradeBlock ETX, a spot reference rate for ETH, fell 15%, from about $1,765 to $1,534 in just over half an hour, before recovering almost as quickly. It was notable because it broke one of the most liquid markets in crypto.      The Feb. 22 ETH sell-off came with larger than usual volume on all four of the exchanges that are components of the ETX. One of these exchanges, Kraken, experienced a ""flash crash,"" a rapid and anomalous drop in price. Flash crashes aren't entirely uncommon in crypto – Binance experienced one on Friday when it was hit with a sudden influx of orders for Polkadot trading contracts – but Kraken's was extremely notable since it saw ETH-U.S. dollar trades as low as $700, less than half the lowest price printed on any other ETX component exchange.      An analysis of the Kraken ETH flash crash is inconclusive as to whether it was caused by a technical glitch. However, TradeBlock data shows that trading activity on Kraken wasn't much different from what two comparable ETX component exchanges saw in the lead-up to the crash, which happened at 9:18 a.m. ET (2:18 p.m. UTC). [TradeBlock is a subsidiary of CoinDesk.] The analysis shines a light on the fragmented nature of crypto market structure, where market disruptions affect even the most liquid assets, even under normal market dynamics. CoinDesk reached out to Kraken for comment, but did not receive any statement in time for publication.    What happened, tick-by-tick    The chart above tracks the ETX ether price, alongside trades printed on each of the four exchanges that make up the ETX. Right up to about 9:18 a.m. ET, all four exchanges and the ETX reference rate are moving in sync, in what looks like a fairly normal ether price dip. The increasing size of the bubbles represents larger and larger trades as traders react to the price action, one way or another. At 9:18 a.m., the Kraken market, represented in yellow, suddenly crashes severely. Its trades drop out of the ETX calculation as it continues for the next 15 minutes or so to print trades way out of line with the rest of the market.      These four exchanges represent the most liquid ETH-USD markets that are accessible to U.S. investors. Kraken's CEO has said the Kraken ETH flash crash was not the result of a technical glitch. As the following three charts will show, however, two comparable ETX component exchanges handled comparable increases in volume just fine, including the usually lower-volume ETH-USD market on Bitstamp. The ETX incorporates only executed trades, not orders.    Kraken volumes were high, not highest    The yellow, green and blue lines in the chart above show minute-by-minute volume on Bitstamp, Coinbase and Kraken. LMAX, the fourth ETX component exchange, is excluded because it represents exclusively institutional volume. The others are a mix of institutional and retail activity.      The surge in volume on Kraken that preceded its ETH flash crash was not the largest of the three exchanges, nor was it a greater outlier compared with normal ETH-USD activity on the exchange.    Kraken printed the largest trade    Kraken did, however, see the largest single ETH-USD transaction of the three, represented by a spike in the yellow line that's well above other large trades that morning. It was a 481.4 ETH trade executed at 9:08 a.m. ET, just as the ETX reference rate had slid to a hair above $1,700, and about 10 minutes before Kraken prices dove so far below the average. That could have been the culprit that dried up the order book, but it's not such an outlier that it looks conclusive. Coinbase's largest trade, seen on the blue line at 9:11 a.m. ET, was 376.7 ETH. Bitstamp's was 184.1 ETH, at 8:52 a.m. ET.    A surge in large trades    Were there other large trades? Yes. At 9:18 a.m. ET, as the Kraken ETH flash crash began, Kraken handled 13 trades in volume of 50 ETH or greater. That's significantly more large ETH trades than any other market at that time. However, it wasn't the highest count of large ETH trades on the morning of Feb. 22. At 8:52 a.m. ET, Bitstamp printed 14 transactions of 50 ETH or more. By 9:29 a.m. ET, Kraken would match that number, presumably as arbitrage traders took advantage of the still-wide spread between prices printed on Kraken and the rest of the market, as represented by the ETX.      As noted above, the ETX counts only executed trades. This is to prevent manipulation of the reference rate through order-book activities like ""spoofing,"" a kind of manipulative activity in which traders place disingenuous orders, to simulate demand. If it's order-book analysis you're looking for, Kaiko has a good breakdown of the Kraken ETH flash crash, along those lines.      Kaiko didn't find any conclusive evidence as to what caused the crash, either. Whether it was a technical glitch or a sudden run on the order book probably doesn’t matter. With price discovery taking place on multiple venues, technology risk is multiplied and liquidity is divided. Until capital is able to flow more freely into these fragmented markets, investors should expect more flash-crash events.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Galen Moore,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/05/what-causes-a-crypto-flash-crash-sometimes-business-as-usual,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8c27a09dc1f5882276476cce7d349d2a33fb9549-2560x1700.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386101,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBRIER,1614958832,Ethereum's 'EIP 1559' Fee Market Overhaul Greenlit for July,"One of the most significant and contentious alterations to the Ethereum blockchain in recent memory is now scheduled for inclusion into its codebase.      Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 will be packaged with the London hard fork this coming July regardless of the mining industry's discontent with the proposal, according to the All Core Developers call Friday. At least five other EIPs are likely to join EIP 1559 in London.      EIP 1559 flips a typical blockchain transaction on its head in order to fix numerous issues with Ethereum’s user experience. Traditionally, a user sends a gas fee to a miner for a transaction to be included in a block. That gas fee will now be sent to the network itself as a sort of “burn” called basefee with only an optional tip paid to miners. The burnt fee is algorithmically set as well, ostensibly making it easier for users to pay a fair fee.      The proposal has garnered some of the largest support to date from Ethereum application creators and users alike, given the current difficulty of selecting a correct transaction fee. Miners and mining pools, on the other hand, have been gathering in opposition against the proposal as it progressed toward mainnet.    Mining gold rush    Indeed, Ethereum mining has been a particularly lucrative business of late. Total mining revenue surpassed a record $1.3 billion in February, with some 50% coming from fees alone, according to Coin Metrics. An increase in both the price of ether and transaction fees has introduced a wave of new hash power to the network, which is more than double that of a year ago.      Minority mining pool Flexpool launched a marketing campaign against the EIP. Several minority pools joined, followed by majority pools Ethermine and SparkPool. Over 60% of the Ethereum network’s hash power is now against the proposal. F2Pool is the largest pool in favor of the EIP, with some 10% hash power.      On the call, Ethereum developers decided to pair EIP 1559 with a delay to the difficulty bomb. Also called the “Ice Age,” the bomb incrementally increases the difficulty of mining on the Ethereum network. Geth team lead Péter Szilágyi said that pairing EIP 1559 with the delay helped ensure no one would fork Ethereum at that time without having to undergo some technical hurdles.    MEV to the rescue    Mining pools have only a few options to stop EIP 1559 now that it's included, and most of these would be considered actively hostile against the network. The largest danger would be a 51% attack against Ethereum, which would censor transactions using the EIPs framework. It remains unlikely, however, given various financial incentives not to attack the network.      For example, successfully using a 51% attack against Ethereum would likely decrease the value of ether in the short term. (Or maybe not, as three 51% attacks on Ethereum Classic have shown).      Moreover, a new revenue replacement is quickly becoming available for mining networks. Called miner extracted value (MEV), miners can take advantage of their place as arbiters in how blocks are packaged to “front-run” profitable trades. MEV is currently popular among decentralized finance (DeFi) traders who bid up gas prices to secure their place in the block. Many Ethereum mining pools are currently implementing MEV software to gather this untapped source of revenue.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | ETC | MARKET | MINING | FORKS,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/03/05/ethereums-eip-1559-fee-market-overhaul-greenlit-for-july,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e1c0f6224d17e582b05602a300c6fd2e85b2bd30-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Nyan Cat sold for an eye-popping 300 ETH (roughly $600,000 at purchase) on Feb. 19. (That same 300 ETH is now worth $451,000.)      Torres told CoinDesk via email his inspiration behind the Dogecoin NFT was based on the theme of ""Luck.""      ""I wanted a bright and shiny coin for the piece, then decided to incorporate my style into the work,"" Torres said. ""I also chose a drop date with as many lucky numbers as possible, even timed down to the drop (3:33pm).""      The Dogecoin NFT ultimately found a home with buyer Mondo, whose bio on Foundation states, ""I've received 5000 ETH as a gift from my father back in early 2016 and then it all started…""      ""Memes have always held great power,"" Torres said. ""Some specific memes have been shared around the world millions of times and have become a part of our culture.""      Torres sees NFTs as a way for memelords to monetize their creations more fairly.    See also: Digital Artwork Sells for Record-Breaking $6.6M in Ether on Winklevoss-Owned Marketplace    The Nyan Dogecoin sale joins a growing trend of NFT artwork being sold on a variety of marketplaces with some pieces fetching millions.      ""Anything is worth what someone is willing to pay,"" meme artist Ryder Ripps told CoinDesk. Ripps is the self-declared creator of the popular 2010 meme graphic ""deal with it.""      According to Foundation data, Ripps' rights for the ""deal with it"" artwork sold for 15 ETH (roughly $22,500) on Thursday. The artist, however, compared NFTs to barcodes, such as those on soda bottles used to identify the item at checkout.      ""I don't think you should buy something just because it has a barcode,"" said Ripps before conceding that Torres' Nyan Cat was worth a lot.      ""These things are very culturally relevant,"" Ripps added.

Yearn tweeted Friday that it has decided to end its merger process with Cover Protocol, a peer-to-peer, decentralized insurance marketplace and that both protocols will continue to operate independently. No reason was given for the breakup.  Andre Cronje of Yearn subsequently expressed his disappointment in a now-deleted tweet, saying: ""I personally find it sad. I had very high regard, trust, and faith in the Cover team. Lesson learned. Won't trust them again.""  Yearn added that yVault depositors who have purchased Cover protection will be unaffected.  Plans for the merger were announced in November, with the aim of Cover becoming Yearn's backstop coverage provider for its vaults and offering users a reduced risk product.  Yearn suffered an exploit in one of its DAI lending pools on Feb. 5, draining $11 million.  Cover also suffered an exploit in December, when a ""white hat"" hacker tricked the protocol into minting 40 quintillion of its native tokens, which the hacker cashed out before subsequently returning them.

Prices for the quarterly perpetual-futures contracts on polkadot were trading around $33.25 right around 1:45 coordinated universal time (8:45 p.m. EST), when suddenly they tumbled 99.2%.  The contracts fell as low as $0.25 in less than a minute, before quickly bouncing back to around $33.  In just that single minute, some $18 million of the contracts changed hands on the exchange.  ""A user, who held a large position, put a single stop market order in the market, which triggered this needle,"" a Binance representative told CoinDesk in an email. ""It didn't affect any other users' positions as we are using mark price for liquidations.""  ""We will add more controls of stop market order size limits to prevent a similar recurrence,"" the representative added.  While the futures market flash crashed, the cryptocurrency held steady near 33 USDT in the spot market, Binance's data shows.  These ""coin-margined"" perpetual futures are products margined and priced using a cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin, instead of the dollar (fiat).  A stop market order is an order to buy or sell a stock at the market price once the user-decided stop price is hit.  In this case, the user was holding a large position that exceeded the total available bids in the market, according to the Binance representative.  Polkadot is a blockchain network that supports various interconnected sub-blockchains called parachains, designed to provide a higher transaction throughput than the leading Ethereum network.  The Polkadot network's DOT token is one of this year's hottest cryptocurrencies, quadrupling in price already in 2021, for a market value of more than $30 billion.

42386102,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBRIID,1614952020,How Bitcoin Could Be Affected by February’s Positive Jobs Report,"Jobs in the U.S. rose by 379,000 in February, far above the general consensus of 185,000 to 200,000 jobs, coming in much better than January or December’s report.      The U.S. added a revised 117,000 out of 105,000 expected jobs in January and lost a revised 306,000 jobs in December. In February the unemployment rate fell from 6.3% to 6.2%.    Lea este artículo en español.    The positive report could create more volatility in the U.S. Treasurys market, David Beckworth, a former international economist at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, told CoinDesk.      On Thursday, bond yields rose to 1.5% after U.S. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that the economy would see temporary inflation upon reopening. The rate climbed further to 1.61% after Friday’s jobs report came out.      Because of the market's sensitivity to interest rates outlooks, it’s possible there will be a sell-off of high-risk assets (like bitcoin) with the jobs report overshooting estimates, said Steven Kelly, a research associate at the Yale Program on Financial Stability.      It’s unlikely that the Fed will pull back on quantitative easing or raise rates in response to volatility in Treasury yields, Kelly added, but it could consider yield curve control or Operation Twist.      The Fed would have to see “material unintended consequences of QE” to pull back on its $120 billion-a-month of bond purchasing, Kelly said. For now, bitcoiners can still count on the Fed bringing more liquidity to the markets and giving investors the liquidity to invest more in riskier assets.      “Part of QE isn’t just about lower yields,” Kelly said. “It’s about encouraging the search for yield to some extent. That’s often cited as a financial stability downside of QE, but it’s also part of the point – it’s to discourage a flight to safety.”    Pandemic-hit industries returning    The largest increase in jobs came the service sectors hit hardest by COVID-19 – leisure and hospitality industries added 355,000 in the month of February.      “We have an economy that is poised to snapback,” former Federal Reserve macroeconomist Claudia Sahm said on Thursday. “This is still short of mission accomplished; 10 million jobs are still missing.”      The employment-to-population ratio, which measures the number of people employed against the total working-age population, changed little month-to-month at 57.6%, down 3.5 percentage points year-over-year. Employment declined in state and local government education, construction and mining, with local government education losing 37,000 jobs and state government education losing 32,000.      The actual jobs increase could be higher since the Bureau of Labor Statistics survey went out three weeks ago, Sahm added. Vaccinations have increased significantly since then – U.S. President Joe Biden announced this week that there would be enough vaccine supply to cover all Americans by the end of May, two months ahead of previous estimates.      While the additional jobs are not insignificant, they are unlikely to have an impact on stimulus negotiations, Sahm added. This means that somewhere between a $1.5 trillion and $1.9 trillion relief bill (depending on negotiations) is coming for Americans soon, she said.

42386103,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBRIGx,1614949200,Egyptians Are Buying Bitcoin Despite Prohibitive New Banking Laws,"Egyptian user registrations on U.K.-based cryptocurrency exchange CEX.IO rose 250% in January from the previous month.      According to the firm’s executive director, Konstantin Anissimov, bitcoin trading volumes in Egypt on CEX.IO were also up more than 400% from December to January, reflecting trends seen by other crypto platforms in the country. CEX.IO is a regulated cryptocurrency exchange with over 3 million users worldwide, according to its website.      “For Egypt, I haven't seen anything like that on our exchange,” Anissimov told CoinDesk, referring to the spike.      For peer-to-peer crypto trading platforms like LocalBitcoins and Paxful, the rise was more gradual. Public trading data shows volume on the platforms rose relatively steadily through 2020. On LocalBitcoins, new user registrations and trading volumes were up 100% between 2019 and 2020 in Egypt, according to the firm’s chief marketing officer, Jukka Blomberg.      Both in terms of new Egyptian users and trading volumes, Blomberg said January 2021 was “the best month within the last three years.”      The dramatic jumps in bitcoin transactions are all the more striking given the regulatory uncertainty on crypto use in Egypt. Crypto trading has been forbidden in the country under Islamic law since 2018. Although a religious decree is not legally binding, new amendments to Egypt’s banking laws in September 2020 prohibits the issuing, dealing or promoting of cryptocurrencies without an applicable license from the central bank of Egypt (ECB).      The ECB has yet to issue a crypto licensing framework or guidelines. Nonetheless, in late February, local media reported authorities had arrested a man from Egypt’s Menoufia Governorate for promoting the circulation of virtual digital currencies like bitcoin on social media. Trading volumes on peer-to-peer platforms LocalBitcoins and Paxful dipped in the week following the incident, though it is unclear whether the arrest was the cause for the drop.      “There are no easy ways of purchasing crypto in Egypt. So any volumes that we see of people actively buying bitcoin is even more memorable given how difficult it is to acquire it … they're buying it in this really painful way,” Hany Rashwan, Egyptian entrepreneur and founder of crypto technology platforms Amun and 21Shares, told CoinDesk.    Regulation    In 2018, Shawki Allam, the Grand Mufti (the most senior religious authority) of Egypt, declared the use of cryptocurrencies forbidden under Islamic Law, citing the volatility and anonymity that could facilitate tax evasion, money laundering, terrorist financing and other illegal activities. The law was passed in the form of a fatwa.      However, the new banking laws reflect Egypt’s desire to move towards a more digital and inclusive financial system because the laws cover both payment processors and fintech firms in great detail.      “The government has stated time and time again that financial inclusion and elevating our financial system for all Egyptians is a high priority,” Rashwan said.      Egypt has a large unbanked population. A 2018 World Bank report on financial inclusion revealed that up to 67% of the population above the age of 15 do not have bank accounts. Egypt was also one of the top five receivers of remittances globally (behind India, China, Mexico and the Philippines) receiving around $29 billion, according to a 2019 World Bank report, and unbanked adults in Egypt received domestic remittances via cash or over-the-counter services.    Read more: Nigeria’s Crypto Ban Fuels Mistrust in Government    “As a country, despite its size, despite its economy, despite its importance, it’s really underbanked, which is something that the government is actively looking to fix,” Rashwan said.      In addition to laying out regulatory requirements for fintech, the new laws define cryptocurrencies as electronically stored currencies that are not denominated in any currency issued by the authorities and are circulated over the internet. The laws also define electronic money as a monetary value that is backed by an official currency issued by a licensed entity.      The banking laws state that the issuing, trading of and promoting cryptocurrency and electronic money are prohibited, along with the “creation of operation of platforms for trading or carrying out activities related to them” without obtaining a license.      “The central bank gave itself the power of regulating and potentially establishing an Egyptian stablecoin, or essentially a central bank issued currency. I think that's very positive. They're likely doing it because they want to make remittances easier and payments in general cheaper. And this, hopefully will be the first real crypto regulations within the country from the top,” Rashwan said.    Behind the demand    The ECB prohibition clearly hasn’t stopped Egyptians from buying more crypto, and a number of factors may be driving the demand.      According to Blomberg, when a country faces economic or political turbulence, that typically drives up the demand for bitcoin. The COVID-19 pandemic has put a lot of countries under unusual economic pressures.      In certain emerging markets like Argentina and Nigeria, where high inflation and restrictions on foreign currency exchange in 2020 drove the value of local currencies downward, people turned to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin in search of a more stable asset to store their wealth.      “What we usually see across our platform is that in countries which are prone to inflation, there's a direct correlation between inflation and an increased interest in cryptocurrencies,” CEX.IO’s Anissimov said.      But inflation in Egypt has remained well below its target of 9% in the last few months according to Bloomberg. A World Bank report suggested inflation has remained low in Egypt because of subdued demand thanks to the pandemic slowing down the economy.    Read more: State of Crypto: India and Nigeria’s Crypto Crackdowns Continue Old Trends    However, World Bank data also showed Egypt’s economic growth slowed from 5.6% in 2019 to 3.5% in 2020, and is projected to drop further this year. The pandemic caused unemployment to rise to 9.6% in the second quarter of 2020 compared to 7.5% in the previous year.      According to Blomberg, it has increased the need for alternative income streams for Egyptians.      “Most of our Egyptian users are relatively young (under 34) who are looking for additional income by trading or hodling,” LocalBitcoins’ Blomberg said in an email to CoinDesk.      An Egyptian bitcoin miner told Al Monitor back in September that “thousands of Egyptians” who are unemployed or working from home are attracted to bitcoin mining and trading “since they do not require huge capitals [sic] to start”      Those who truly believe cryptocurrency is the new frontier of financial systems will always find ways to get their hands on crypto, Anissimov said.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/05/egyptians-are-buying-bitcoin-despite-prohibitive-new-banking-laws,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3fff14dbb7e666b14b6f6b7968ab094331663532-2560x1767.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The payments and remittances startup closely associated with the XRP cryptocurrency filed its response to an amended SEC complaint alleging Ripple violated federal securities laws. Ripple continued to deny each of the SEC’s claims in a paragraph-by-paragraph rebuttal reminiscent of the tactic messaging platform Kik used when it faced the SEC two years ago.      Much of the response resembled Ripple’s first answer, filed at the end of January, to the SEC’s original complaint, which the regulator brought at the end of 2020. The SEC filed an amended complaint in mid-February,      As it had in January, Ripple said it reserved the right to file a motion to dismiss the complaint at a future point.      In its new response, the San Francisco-based startup continued to argue that XRP is not a security and that it had not violated federal law in selling XRP over the past eight years. Many of the new additions to the response addressed statements the SEC added about documents the regulator believes support its case that Ripple should have known its sales may have been securities transactions.      The new response also leaned more heavily on claims that crypto trading platforms discussed whether to list XRP with the SEC in previous years. One unnamed company, referred to as “Platform A,” reportedly “evaluated XRP’s regulatory status in light of prior SEC guidance and actions.”      “Platform A met with SEC staff in the Division of Corporation Finance and Division of Trading and Markets, including at least one senior SEC staff member who previously met with Ripple on multiple occasions during investigation-related meetings in 2018, about the legal status of XRP and sought guidance on whether the SEC staff considered XRP a security,” the response said.      While Ripple did not name the platform, Coinbase is perhaps the most prominent U.S.-based crypto exchange that listed XRP in early 2019.      Ripple said the unnamed platform was not told the SEC considered XRP to be a security, and listed the asset after that conversation.      Coinbase has since suspended trading due to the ongoing SEC suit, alongside numerous other exchanges operating in the U.S. Ripple claimed that has cost XRP holders roughly $15 billion during the past few months.      The price of XRP plunged dramatically after the suit was first announced by Ripple, dropping from near 60 cents to around 27 cents. It has since breached the 60 cent level again, and was trading closer to 45 cents at press time.

Alexander Höptner, who joined the exchange in December, said Thursday he is planning on transforming the exchange and expanding business operations by adding three new services, according to a Bloomberg report.  Prior to joining the firm, Höptner worked for the German exchange Börse Stuttgart. In his new role, he plans to transform BitMEX by amending relationships with regulators and expanding business operations to spot trading and brokerage and custody services.  “I was coming from the regulated and classical world. I have a lot of touchpoints with the regulators already…Now I’m working on the crypto side and bringing the crypto side to the regulated world,” he said.  BitMEX announced Thursday the appointment of auditing veteran Stephan Lutz as its new chief financial officer. Lutz will take charge of financial growth, business expansion and profitability.  In October, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and federal prosecutors charged BitMEX with facilitating unregistered trading and other violations.  As reported by CoinDesk Wednesday, BitMEX founder and former CEO Arthur Hayes, who is currently in Singapore, could surrender to U.S. authorities next month.

""The 21-week SMA (Simple Moving Average) is the level to defend for the bulls,"" trader and technical analyst Michaël van de Poppe told CoinDesk. ""The bias remains bullish as long as the SMA support is intact.""      An SMA is an arithmetic moving average calculated by adding recent prices and dividing the tally by the number of periods. SMAs are trend-following, lagging indicators and often act as support and resistance levels.      The 21-week SMA acted as a price floor during the previous bull market, as seen below.      The cryptocurrency repeatedly found dip demand (marked by arrows) around the 21-week SMA throughout the rally from $300 to $19,783 seen in the October 2015-December 2017 period.      If history is a guide, deeper pullbacks, if any, could run out of steam around the 21-week SMA this year. The technical line is now located at $32,240, while bitcoin is changing hands near $46,500.      A continued rise in the U.S. Treasury yields could push the dollar higher, sending bitcoin toward the SMA support.      One cannot rule out that possibility as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell defied expectations on Thursday by expressing little concern regarding the recent spike in yields. That has left the doors open for a further rally in yields and an extension of last week's risk aversion trades.      The dollar strengthened, while bitcoin and stocks fell in the seven days to Feb. 28, as the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield surged to a 12-month high of 1.6% and investors priced in higher odds of an early unwinding of the Federal Reserve's stimulus.      The yield remains elevated near 1.6% at press time, and the dollar index is hovering at a three-month high of 92.00. Also, European stocks and the U.S. stock futures are flashing red.      Both bitcoin and stocks may find some relief later Friday if the U.S. nonfarm payrolls data due at 13:30 UTC paints a gloomy picture of the labor market and sends yields lower.
