Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin traded higher but was poised to notch a record ninth straight weekly loss. Prices for Terra's new LUNA tokens crashed nearly as soon as they launched.  Insights: Stepn has drawn the ire of Chinese regulators.  Technician's take: BTC's volatility could rise, especially if another price breakdown occurs.

Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $29,243  Ether (ETH): $1,805  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Stellar XLM +7.0% Smart Contract Platform Algorand ALGO +4.0% Smart Contract Platform Chainlink LINK +3.6% Computing  Biggest Losers  There are no losers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Bitcoin heads for record ninth weekly loss  Bitcoin was poised to end the week in the red, which would extend the losing streak for the largest cryptocurrency to a record nine weeks. Until recently, bitcoin had never gone through more than six weeks in a row without a positive return, in a trading history going back to the early 2010s.  So the sentiment leans grim amid light trading on a holiday weekend in the U.S. Just in May, bitcoin has descended to about $29,400 from about $37,600.  ""If it's able to break through $30K, it may make a run,"" Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, told CoinDesk in an email. ""But if it continues to be pressured down by bearish sentiment, it could fall to its next support line around $25K.""  Price crash mars Terra's 'LUNA 2' airdrop  What was billed by the badly bruised Terra project as a ""revival"" looked more like a redux over the weekend as new LUNA tokens were issued and promptly plunged in value.  A key element of Terra's plan was to deliver new LUNA tokens to holders of the project's now vastly depreciated UST stablecoins as well as to holders of the older, existing LUNA tokens. The older tokens have now been converted into ""LUNA classic"" under the trading ticker LUNC; as of press time the market capitalization for those legacy tokens was around $700 million, down from about $40 billion fewer than two months ago.  It's not entirely clear what the LUNC tokens will be used for, though, because most Terra developers are now expected to move activity over to the newly launched replacement chain – that is, if they don't get recruited by other blockchains.  The new LUNA tokens initially traded on May 28 around $17 but tumbled soon afterward and by late Sunday were changing hands around $5.28, according to the website CoinGecko.  On Twitter, some commenters complained of being confused by it all while others vowed to immediately cash out of any and all Terra-related tokens.     Markets  (Friday's prices.)  S&P 500: 4,158 +2.4%  DJIA: 33,212 +1.7%  Nasdaq: 12,131 +3.3%  Gold: $1,853 +0.03%  Insights  Stepn has drawn the ire of Chinese regulators  What do Apple, Tesla, Didi and Stepn have in common? They’ve had run-ins with China’s regulators on how they handle data.  Stepn, which bills itself as a move-to-earn game, announced Friday that it is blacklisting players with a Chinese IP address from using the app’s GPS functionality. Within the game, players earn crypto by walking, jogging or running, which requires use of the phone’s GPS receiver to track distance. Without the ability to use this, the game and the app are now useless.  China’s Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) regulates how firms handle and process the data of Chinese nationals and has been compared in structure to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This complements the country’s Data Security Law (DSL), which regulates the export of data, particularly what it defines as sensitive data, including location information.  As per the DSL and PIPL, exporting sensitive data isn’t banned, but by default it should be stored locally in China. Should there be a need to export said data, it would have to undergo a security assessment by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), which regulates web-based business and would likely need to be anonymized.  Stepn said it never did business in China, and records show it's headquartered in Australia. But like the GDPR, China’s data rules are extraterritorial. Firms can be penalized if they handle data that originated in China, even if the firm is based abroad. This would be of particular concern to companies that have Chinese nationals on their team as they could face trouble when re-entering China.  Of all the firms to be hit with compliance measures around this law, Stepn is the smallest. Apple and Tesla have both built data centers in China in order to comply with these regulations.  Ridesharing app Didi found itself in a tight spot regarding compliance with these rules.  Didi is delisting from the New York Stock Exchange after Chinese regulators expressed concern with how much data was potentially being made available to other countries. In the end, authorities blocked the app from China’s app stores and prohibited new users from signing up. Didi reached a compromise with regulators by promising a Hong Kong listing after its removal from U.S. exchanges, but the company is still waiting for regulators to give it a green light to return to business as usual.  Chinese regulators’ outsized interest in Stepn stems not only because crypto is involved but because of problems that Strava, another fitness app, created.  Strava, which doesn’t have a crypto component, is the must-have social network for athletes and fitness freaks. But researchers found that Strava sits on a treasure trove of location information about its users’ movements. By harvesting data from public achievement boards, researchers were able to find social media profiles and create a “pattern of life.”  Worse, many military personnel are avid Strava users. Thus, the app’s achievement boards and heat maps have given away the locations of military bases and the presence of U.S. soldiers in locations that weren’t previously announced.  So perhaps Chinese regulators have a point. Fitness tracking apps are known to be problematic from a privacy perspective, and for Beijing the crypto angle just makes it worse.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Faces Resistance at $33K; Support at $22K-$25K  Bitcoin (BTC) has traded below the $33,000 resistance level last week, although price action has stabilized within a tight range. That could point to an increase in volatility, similar to what occurred earlier this month.  BTC was down by about 3% over the past week and has outperformed most alternative cryptos, which suggests a lower appetite for risk among traders. Typically, in down markets, BTC declines less than alts because of its lower risk profile.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the weekly chart is the most oversold since March 2020, which preceded a strong crypto rally. This time, however, the deterioration in long-term momentum suggests limited upside in BTC.  There is growing risk of additional breakdowns in price because of negative momentum readings based on weekly and monthly price data. If a volatile down move occurs, initial support is seen at $25,000, which is around the May 9 price low. There is additional support at the 200-week moving average, currently at $22,061, which could stabilize price action.  A more conclusive downside target would be $17,673, which is roughly 78% of the prior uptrend from March 2020 to November 2021. That price level would also result in a roughly 73% peak-to-trough decline, which could signal capitulation. Bitcoin declined by 83% from its all-time high around $19,890 during the 2018 crypto bear market.

The vast majority of payments in the U.K. use this system. Newer technologies such as PayPal can also be used for many retail purchases."" (CoinDesk columnist Frances Coppola) ... ""The week of the terraUSD (UST) collapse was among the most painful weeks in crypto history – and one we’ll reckon with for a long time. It wrought havoc on the crypto market, resulting in billions of dollars in lost value. And while those in Washington, D.C., rightly debate next steps, a smart, thoughtful conversation around potential regulation is critical.""

""The price for regular gasoline in California has already risen to more than $6 a gallon, and it is virtually impossible to find gas for under $4 anywhere else. Nationwide, prices have risen by nearly 50 cents a gallon over the last month. The war in Ukraine is the most immediate cause for the jump in prices as global refiners, tanker companies and traders shun Russian exports, forcing up to three million barrels of oil a day off the market. Energy traders have also bid up oil prices in the expectation that Western governments will impose even tougher sanctions on Russia and its energy industry.

Per Bloomberg, crypto-market volume dropped 43% and 35% on the holiday in 2020 and 2021, respectively. The crypto space has been beaten down in 2022, especially following the collapse of algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST-USD) and its sister coin Luna (LUNA-USD) in recent weeks.

42421562,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXocof,1653835800,"The Bitcoin-Stock Market Decoupling Isn’t Happening Yet, but It Totally Will","For U.S.-based readers, I hope you are lucky enough to have a long holiday weekend to enjoy. If you do, remember you are given this day off because military personnel gave their lives.  I’m personally taking this long weekend to see one of my closest friends get married. So this week’s newsletter will be short, sweet and a bit off-the-wall (and mostly statistically insignificant). When I asked one of my other closest friends how I would convince y’all to read something like this he gave me some great advice.  So, please. Let me write about the Decoupling. Indulge me.  – George Kaloudis  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  The Decoupling. The latest iteration of “hopium” for bitcoiners and crypto natives. When it finally inevitably happens, it’ll be up only for Big Crypto and down only for Big Fiat.  But what it actually means is a bit funny. The Decoupling is the moment when bitcoin’s price diverges from equities and starts going up when equities go down (and vice versa). The Decoupling is the moment when bitcoin (BTC) and equities become negatively correlated to each other. Bitcoin will go to $1 million a coin and equities will spiral to zero.  It’s a bit funny because bitcoin was uncorrelated to almost all macro assets (gold, S&P 500, bonds, U.S. dollar) not too long ago. We wrote about this in our 2021 research report (page 9). Here is the chart we shared in that report with the accompanying text.  In general, macro assets remained within an uncorrelated band (-0.2 to 0.2) in 2021. This is contrasted to 2H 2020, where gold and equities were somewhat positively correlated to BTC, and the U.S. dollar (USD) was somewhat negatively correlated to BTC. Bitcoin is a unique macro asset like no other.  For the record, correlation simply means how much two measures vary together, divided by how much they usually vary individually (thank you, Noelle Acheson). We care so that we can describe the relationship between the returns of bitcoin and other assets. The correlation coefficient, the number or the “r”, referenced relates to the strength of the relationship. In the context of asset returns a correlation coefficient of:  +1.0 means when Asset A gained x%, Asset B gained x%.  0.0 means when Asset A gained x%, Asset B gained y% with an absence of a linear relationship between x and y (more below).  -1.0 means when Asset A gained x%, Asset B lost x%.  A 0.0 correlation coefficient signifies uncorrelatedness, and it’s either rather easy or rather difficult to imagine (unless you have a chaotic mind). Either all the numbers in the data sets are exactly the same, a constant, which is mathematically defined as undefined correlation, or the data set looks like utter chaos. Actually creating an arbitrary dataset with zero correlation is not easy (except for the boring orthogonal case), so I included the boring data set and an illustration of the chaotic case to drive this point home.  Being uncorrelated is awesome, but wouldn’t it be fascinating if bitcoin was negatively correlated to stocks? And then, when that happened, stocks all went on a hell-train path to zero and bitcoin went up and up forever? That’s the Decoupling.  The Decoupling would force traditional financiers to start thinking about bitcoin as a risk-off asset. Yes – less risky than stocks. The volatile digital cash that mainly acts as a vehicle for speculation now will become less risky than stocks following the Decoupling.  So, when Decoupling?  The Decoupling is also supposed to be aggressive; “Gradually, then suddenly” is one of its calling cards. Unfortunately, 2022 has smashed the dreams of an aggressive decoupling. Here are the 90-day trailing correlations in 2022 between bitcoin and the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite Index:  This clearly isn’t the Decoupling, but it does look interesting. In 2022, these stock indexes moved from a weak positive correlation to bitcoin into the positive strongly correlated band (>0.7). While not as potentially impressive as a strong negative correlation would imply, bitcoin’s return profile still resembles a macro asset we haven’t quite seen before. Just a year ago the S&P 500 and bitcoin’s correlation coefficient was negative and close to zero. Correlation moving from near-zero to strong in a year is remarkable. On top of that, this correlation was strongly negative back in 2019.  So yes, bitcoin is unique. And thus, it bears repeating: Bitcoin is unlike any other macro asset we have seen.  This all reads like a whole lot of nothing, aside from bitcoin’s uniqueness (which we already knew). But there was something quite remarkable (and statistically insignificant) I saw last Wednesday when flipping through some charts. I saw this:  There it is, all the way to the left on this chart. The first signs of the Decoupling. When Decoupling? Maybe soon (but probably not).",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | RESEARCH,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/29/the-bitcoin-stock-market-decoupling-isnt-happening-yet-but-it-totally-will,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2d0faf177048412c8dcd3757409676b4c71f22b8-7952x5304.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

DeFi plays a role in bringing all the concepts together in a space where users can own and exchange value over blockchain ecosystems. But how exactly does DeFi stand out in the metaverse story? The following pointers do tell: What is Decentralized Finance? DeFi is a phrase in many conversations involving blockchain and cryptocurrencies, yet it does not attract as much attention.

DeFi projects are becoming popular with the establishment of web 3.0 facilities that will sustain the needs of the metaverse. The new decentralized internet will ensure customer-centred strategies for social and financial outcomes in the digital and physical realms. But what is the difference between DeFi and metaverse?

Before the onset of the project, it was not possible to generate tokens from the XMR blockchain; mainly because it had no support for tokenization.

Thereby resulting in reduced traction and a hiatus when the two developers realized the challenge of building a DeFi protocol from the ground up. As a result, the two initial founders dumped the project in the final quarter of 2018.
