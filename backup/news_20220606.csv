42423186,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2X4zh,1654559534,"Canadian Crypto Trading Platform VirgoCX Raises $8M, With Growth in Sight","Canadian cryptocurrency trading platform VirgoCX has raised $7.95 million (C$10 million) in a Series A funding round that will help the firm expand globally and add products and services.  Global venture fund Draper Dragon led the financing, which also included Blockdream Ventures, Cobo Ventures, Molecular Group, Sora Ventures and How Link Investment, according to a statement Monday.  On the regulatory front, the Toronto-based company has been approved by the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) as a Restricted Dealer in crypto assets in all Canadian provinces and territories. Meanwhile, VirgoCX is one of eight registered crypto trading platforms listed by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC).  VirgoCX’s CEO Adam Cai told CoinDesk the company worked diligently to secure the proper licenses to operate in Canada, and is preparing for potential expansion into Australia, the U.K. and some parts of Europe.  “It’s just a natural progression” after garnering Canadian approvals, Cai said. “We have all the necessary infrastructure set up,” he said via phone.  The trading platform's parent company, Virgo Group, is also planning to add staking, decentralized finance (DeFi) yield farming and other services in the ""near future,"" according to its statement.  Virgo Group wants to help the NFT market by increasing liquidity, improving the user experience and lowering barriers to participation. Virgo Group seeks to launch an “NFT Web 3 Liquidity Aggregator to help users instantly complete the sale with competitive prices and a seamless experience,” according to its statement.  Cai told CoinDesk that Virgo Group will soon launch a decentralized market-maker for non-fungible tokens (NFT), in hopes of helping customers sell their NFTs promptly.

This has been the case for the last two months when the leading cryptocurrency had seen 9 consecutive weeks of red closes. Unsurprisingly, this had pained a very bearish image for the digital asset. However, it seems the tide has begun to turn as bitcoin has now ended its streak. A break above $30,000 in the early hours of Monday put BTC in its first weekly close in more than two months. Better Days Ahead For Bitcoin? While the price of bitcoin has been in recovery, it does not exactly erase more than two months of bearish trends. This first green in a long line of reds does not automatically trigger a bull trend for the digital asset. What it does, however, is show that investor sentiment is starting to turn for the better. No doubt the sellers will continue to dominate the market for the better part of the next week but an uptick in positive inflows is expected from here.

42420959,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcX6kwv,1654552551,Cell Protocol Wants to 'Democratize' Liquidity in DeFi,"Access to liquidity is a perennial problem for any market, but especially for decentralized finance (DeFi). Although the aim in crypto is to have fully interoperable networks and tools, users and assets currently are spread across different platforms – stretching capital thin.  Cell Protocol is a so-called smart automated market maker that uses bots to try to better provision liquidity. Its founder would say “more fairly,” too.  This article is part of Road to Consensus.  “We want to democratize liquidity for end users on CLOBs DEXs,” Cell Protocol strategy lead and co-founder Felix Xu said, referring to ""central limit order book decentralized exchanges."" These are a type of open crypto exchanges that apply a similar order book as you might find in traditional asset markets.  It’s a tool to “provide liquidity just like professional market makers,"" Xu explained.  Xu, along with his pseudonymous co-founder @0x5_7, believe CLOBs are the future for decentralized exchanges. Today, many DEXs use what's called an ""automated market maker"" to power trades – like the popular Ethereum-based Uniswap. But Solana-based CLOBs like Mango Markets and Serum are on the rise.  You likely ""have to be a programmer"" to make sense of the current CLOBs, @0x5_7 said. ""You have to know how to code to provide liquidity. That is blocking a lot of the DeFi users,” he said.  See also: Decentralized Exchanges Beat Centralized Counterparts for On-Chain Flows: Chainalysis  Although small for the world of DeFi – Cell only has $250,000 in total value locked (TVL) – it has big ambitions. It looks to essentially rule the feast on liquidity provisioning. Launched in March, it was the “first to market” within the world of Solana.  So it’s not surprising Cell is a finalist for Web 3 Pitch Fest, a hackathon hosted by Extreme Tech Challenge with winners to be announced at CoinDesk’s Consensus Festival.  0x5_7 – a Stanford graduate who is now based in China and requested anonymity – previously worked as an engineer at Coinbase doing blockchain integration and indexing services. Xu is a ""serial blockchain entrepreneur"" who co-founded the privacy-preserving ARPA network and Bella Protocol. (To preserve the anonymity of some of its founding members, Cell Protocol is using non-fungible token cartoon characters.)  Cell Protocol plans to expand ""horizontally and vertically"" and become a unified liquidity layer across DeFi. The next step is integrating with other DEXs on Solana including Serum, Drift and Zeta Markets as well as expanding onto other blockchains.  ""We are expanding to multiple networks and protocols,"" 0x5_7 said. ""We are like building a unified liquidity layer on top of DEXs … then we can pour liquidity and users into our DEXs.”  UPDATE (JUNE 7 – 13:10 UTC): Cell Protocol was launched in March 2022, not August 2021 as previously reported.

That’s in part why Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are exploring space. So here’s a question: In the virtual world, space is theoretically limitless, so why is land so expensive and hard to buy in the metaverse?  This article is part of Road to Consensus.  For Justin Melillo, co-founder and CEO of Mona, this contrivance doesn't make sense. “Artificial scarcity is just silly,” he said, criticizing platforms fueled by “land” speculation. In the Monaverse platform, there are no limits on land and no required fees to enter. Creators can access the platform through their web browser.  Mona is one of eight finalists in the inaugural Web 3 Pitch Fest, which is being hosted by Extreme Tech Challenge and CoinDesk and is part of the Consensus Festival in Austin, Texas. It was launched in 2021 by creators, for creators, Melillo said. He is a 3D visual artist who makes animated films, including work on “Abominable”and “The Croods 2” for DreamWorks, and immersive augmented reality and virtual reality experiences.  Before starting Mona, he worked at Magic Leap where he contributed to the creation of Mica, an artificial-intelligence virtual assistant. His cofounder and COO is also visual artist, Matt Hoerl, who holds 11 patents in the realm of virtual and augmented reality and serves as chief operating officer.  The co-founders determined that what would serve creators best is to allow creators to build and own their work but share it as part of an open, social metaverse. Mona spaces are unique 3D environments that creators build and mint on the Ethereum or Polygon blockchains. And they are interoperable across the metaverse, with portals to connect to other spaces within the Monaverse or other platforms like Decentraland and CryptoVoxels.  Since the launch, more than 3,000 creators have jumped aboard. “The metaverse doesn’t have to belong to big tech companies,” Melillo said in a statement. “It can, and will, be a place for everyone.”  See also:CoinDesk’s Metaverse Week  Visual art is not Mona’s only medium. Melillo is also excited about Mona’s inclusion as a flagship platform for Elvis On-Chain, a multi-metaverse NFT launch including exclusive spaces, events and wearables for Elvis fans. Even though the King has been dead for more than 40 years, there are hundreds of fan clubs worldwide – reported to be as high as 400 just five years ago – not to mention Baz Luhrmann’s “Elvis” biopic starring Tom Hanks currently in theaters.

42421545,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXocY9,1654550280,How Crypto Can Do Good for the World,"Human society in the 21st century is faced with numerous global-scale challenges and systemic risks. These challenges include climate change, misinformation, an insecure digital infrastructure and a lack of economic prosperity. And while solutions for some of these problems are available, they go unsolved because not enough people, groups or nation states have come together to address them in a coordinated way.  Kevin Owocki is the founder of Gitcoin.co, an Ethereum-based network for growing open source software . This article is a preview of the talk she will give on the Big Ideas stage at Consensus 2022 in Austin, Texas, this week. Register for Consensus 2022 here.  Our legacy institutions are not equipped to handle these issues, largely because individuals are focused on their own interests, and nations are focused on their own citizens, leading them down paths that help them but harm the overall system. These sorts of problems are known as “coordination failures.”  But we aren’t trapped forever in this death spiral. With the dawn of Web 3, there is an opportunity to build a better world for our generation and beyond. We can leverage the properties of Web 3 to design crypto-economic systems that are regenerative: systems that are resilient and sustainable, and align conflicting priorities toward the greater good.  Know thy enemy  The Chinese general Sun Tzu wrote that if you “know thy enemy and know thyself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.”  Humanity doesn’t face persistent global-scale problems because we lack solutions, data or ideas. Instead, systemic risks continue because humanity has failed to address them in a coordinated way. Groups often act at cross purposes, or even make enemies out of each other, when the true enemy is conflict itself.  But conflict won’t fix climate change. To fight coordination failure on the environment and other issues, we need a coordination mechanism that is truly global in nature. Luckily, we may have found one: Decentralized blockchain networks allow us to create new incentives and mechanism designs that are borderless and direct.  One way to reinforce coordination is to realign the economic incentives that support a system. By doing so, we create a systematic economic incentive for work to support that system. Five years ago, I saw an opportunity to create better incentives to help fix a specific realm suffering from coordination failure: open-source software.  Much of the open-source software that underpins our digital infrastructure was designed by, and is maintained by, software engineers who are paid little or nothing for their work. This asymmetry between value creation and value capture is why I founded Gitcoin in 2017. We wanted to provide a system to enable those building open-source software to raise money to fund their efforts. We help individuals and communities start, fund and scale open-source projects. Today, Gitcoin is a community of 312,000 developers, and we have directed $62.1 million in funding to open-source projects.  Hence, regenerative crypto economics  We believe Gitcoin can be a model for similar funding programs and eventually for what we call ""regenerative crypto economics."" Regenerative crypto-economic systems satisfy human needs, are net positive and improve the balance between needs and investment. For instance, Gitcoin helps create FOSS (free and open-source software) resources that generate productivity and wealth – with some of those unleashed resources going back into further Gitcoin funding. Some of this has to do with mechanism design and economic incentives, but nearly as important is these systems’ potential to act as a rallying point for fundraising and organizing.  DAOs for maximum positive impact  ImpactDAOs, defined as any DAO (a decentralized autonomous organization) that creates net positive benefits for the ecosystems around it, are the scalable, atomic building blocks of the regenerative crypto-cconomic movement.  Here are some examples of ImpactDAOs and the scale of positive externalities they create:  Regenerative crypto economics is being implemented today by numerous ImpactDAOs, and I dive deep into their work and impact in my new book on ImpactDAOs with co-author Ale Borda.  With ImpactDAOs and the properties of Web 3, we can design a regenerative internet of value to enable the thriving of a diverse global citizenry and to solve the numerous coordination failures that threaten humanity and earth. We can increase and ensure funding for the creation and maintenance of digital public goods like FOSS. We can program our values into our money and make public goods financially sustainable.  We can even eclipse the more prolific and more degenerative use cases of blockchain networks and ignite a positive feedback loop for their regenerative use cases. Most crucially, we can ensure that the future of the internet and the metaverse is not owned by any billionaire or tech giant.  Of course, this a double-edged sword, as value systems can vary wildly, and this tool will empower anyone who decides to use it. But by coordinating the incentives of many participants, and providing a channel for larger alliances of strength and intelligence, system designers can create economies that drive real good for the world.  Crypto for good  With cryptocurrency very much in the headlines these days, some question whether it’s actually good for the world. While the headlines love big winners, crypto’s main benefit over time won’t be to billionaire investors. Its real promise is in creating new structures that drive new behaviors.  Regenerative crypto economics is already helping us build a sustainable funding system for digital-native public goods. In the coming decades, we expect to see economies, democracies and civic groups all over the world upgraded with similar coordination mechanisms, enabling more human thriving.  It is up to us, the members of the Web 3 citizenry, to coordinate in creating a more regenerative world.

Without commenting on the details of the reported probe, a spokesperson for Binance told CoinDesk via email, ""As the industry has grown at a rapid pace, we have been working very diligently to educate and assist law enforcement and regulators in the U.S. and internationally, while also adhering to new guidelines. We will continue to meet all requirements set by regulators.""  BNB was trading down 4% after news of the report came out.  Binance is currently under investigation in the U.S. by the Justice Department, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Internal Revenue Service. Binance is the world’s biggest crypto exchange and says it’s not domiciled in any one country.  The SEC is also investigating market-making companies owned or partially owned by Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao that do business with Binance.US, a U.S.-based affiliate of the global exchange, according to a person familiar with the review, Bloomberg reported.  According to the report, one of the SEC’s focuses is on whether Binance.US is wholly independent of the global exchange and whether employees may be involved in insider trading.

42423196,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2X5Dh,1654546608,Market Wrap: Cryptos Climb Amid Lower Volatility; Sentiment Improves,"Bitcoin (BTC) was up by 4% over the past 24 hours as volatility continued to fade. The cryptocurrency has traded in a tight price range over the past month, but so far has avoided a significant dip below $30,000 since May 12.  The bitcoin dominance ratio, which compares BTC's market cap relative to the total crypto market cap, ticked higher on Monday. That suggests a lower appetite for risk among crypto traders despite short-term price bounces.  For now, bearish sentiment among crypto traders is starting to wane. The bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has stabilized over the past month, similar to what occurred in late January, which preceded a brief rise in crypto prices.  Alternative cryptos (altcoins) were mixed on Monday. For example, Helium's HNT token rallied by as much as 13% over the past 24 hours, compared with a 5% rise in Solana's SOL token. Meanwhile, The Graph's GRT token declined by 2% on Monday.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $31,386, +4.38%    ●Ether (ETH): $1,859, +2.00%    ●S&P 500 daily close: 4,121, +0.31%    ●Gold: $1,844 per troy ounce, −0.08%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 3.04%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Uptick in short liquidations  Bitcoin's current price jump is similar to what occurred last weekend. This time, however, the rise in short liquidations is less extreme.  The chart below shows a lower amount of short liquidations over the past two weeks. That suggests a majority of sellers have not capitulated, which typically occurs at an extreme price low. Instead, long liquidations have been more severe, reflecting an unwind of bullish positions on each successive price drop over the past few weeks.  Liquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position as a safety mechanism due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. That happens primarily in futures trading.  Volatility fades, for now  The chart below shows the recent decline in bitcoin's implied volatility. Option traders have been expecting fewer price swings as bitcoin's price stabilizes between $27,000 and $33,000.  Still, short-term volatility has ticked higher over the past few days, which could point to a rise in trading activity this week.  ""We have a market unwilling to move higher, establishing well-defined boundaries to the upside and downside,"" Greg Magadini, co-founder of Genesis Volatility, wrote in a blog post.  Currently, the options market places a 63% probability that BTC will trade above $28,000 next month. The most active strike price is at $30,000, where puts outnumber calls. That means traders have been seeking protection against additional price drops.

Some investors have reduced their exposure to risky assets, including cryptocurrencies, as financial markets adjust to persistently high inflation, interest-rate hikes by central banks around the globe and growing recession fears. Digital-asset investors see bitcoin, as the cryptocurrency with the longest history and largest market capitalization, as less risky than most other tokens. Bitcoin's ""dominance"" – its share of the overall industry market capitalization of – has climbed higher this year.  BTC traded range-bound between $29,000 and $32,000 last week and was changing hands at $31,259 at press time.  Ethereum funds continued their negative streak, marking nine consecutive weeks of outflows. Investors pulled out $32 million from funds that manage the second-largest cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), adding up to $357 million in outflows year to date. The outflows picked up in December 2021, and they represent a relatively small share (7%) of the total value of assets under management, the report added.  Short-bitcoin funds, which intend to profit from bitcoin's price going lower, saw $1.3 million in inflows.  Multiasset funds, which manage more than one cryptocurrency, netted $4.3 million in inflows, bringing total inflows up to $201 million since the start of the year, underlining investor demand for diversification.  Funds that manage cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin or ether didn't move significantly. Funds that manage solana (SOL) and XRP saw minimal inflows ($0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively).  The regional breakdown shows that last week's flows predominantly came from the Americas with $88 million last week. In comparison, funds listed in Europe saw just $11 million in inflows last week, continuing a trend where ""European investors have been much more bearish this year so far,"" the report added.",POSITIVE,BTC | SOL,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | SOL,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/06/06/bitcoin-funds-rake-in-new-money-as-altcoin-funds-suffer,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2aeeb0790506b6a9cf724dfa731b316c37635fb5-1400x988.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Hive said it decided “it was prudent to take some profits in ETH due to its higher volatility.”  The miner will continue to sell ether from time to time to fund the company’s long-term bitcoin (BTC) mining goals. However, Hive said it will look to replace the ether it has sold in the near future as the company is still expanding its ether mining capacity.  Hive is expected to test units of Intel’s mining rigs this month, with prototype production expected for late summer and mass production scheduled to launch this fall.  Hive is among the first miners to receive Intel’s second-generation, bitcoin-specific mining chips, which are more efficient than those of most rivals.  Hive said that it mined 273.4 bitcoins in May, about 2% higher than April, and 2,694 ether, 6.2% more than April. On a combined basis, it produced 459.2 bitcoin-equivalent in May, similar to last month’s 458.3 output.  The company also expects to have a bitcoin-equivalent hashrate of 6.2 exahash per second (EH/s) in next 12 months, up from its current capacity of 3.4 EH/s.  Hive’s shares are down about 2.8% on Monday, while bitcoin's price has risen about 5% in the last 24 hours.

42423208,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2X4jh,1654544228,The Story of DESK: How CoinDesk Built Its Social Token,"When Consensus 2022 kicks off Thursday, behind the scenes, a complex choreography of wallet identity checks and payment swaps will work to keep DESK, CoinDesk’s social token, circulating through a crowd expected to top 15,000 attendees.  “This is probably the largest crypto media experiment so far. No organization of CoinDesk’s size has done it before,” said Jenil Thakker, CEO of Coinvise, a startup that builds tokenization and community experiences for brands, including CoinDesk.  CoinDesk is rebooting DESK for this year’s Consensus – the media and events company’s first in-person conference since 2019 – in an effort to bring crypto-savvy conference-goers closer to the brand, while also getting hands-on with the tech.  Part experiment, part revamp, DESK will make its debut at the conference in Austin, Texas, Wednesday. There, it will (the organizers hope) become an airline miles-esque rewards program that Consensus attendees can earn by engaging with panels and talks, and then spend on anything from swag to drinks to non-fungible tokens (NFT).  “It’s a tokenized festival experience that’s designed to reward you for the depth of your engagement as you go throughout the festival,” said Luke Layden, CoinDesk’s program manager for DESK. “You will be rewarded for your curiosity.”  CoinDesk’s tech experiment brought on a litany of third parties to help make DESK sing. The token’s transactions will be fee-free using Biconomy, a firm that aims to simplify Web 3 for everyday users. Biconomy’s service allows third parties to pay on-chain computation, or gas, fees, on users’ behalf; in this case, CoinDesk is that third party footing the bill.  DESK will also have a dedicated marketplace for NFTs developed by NFTify; the token will exist as an in-conference payment option on Flexa’s transaction rails; and it emanates from a mint contract set up by Coinvise.  The vision for DESK  Conference cryptocurrencies aren’t entirely new. ETHDenver has for years given attendees iterations of set amounts of tokens as a form of a meal ticket. But CoinDesk’s vision for DESK is larger.  It starts with DESK’s acquisition experience. In-person conference-goers will start amassing the social token by checking in at various panels. It's sort of like a treasure hunt in which the booty gets better the more you pay attention to the map. DESK owners can turn their tokens into grub at food trucks, or swag at booths, or NFTs online.  “It’s just a matter of [the merchant thinking] ‘I want to accept crypto instead of cash,’'' said Trevor Filter, co-founder of Flexa, builder of DESK’s payments rails. “And so you just choose a different button with the point-of-sale terminal [where shoppers normally swipe a card] and then out comes the QR code for the customer to scan.”  Filter’s company will help the merchants accept DESK while still taking home cash they can use. For most cryptocurrencies, Flexa accomplishes this by swapping, say, the customer’s bitcoin for dollars that the merchant can deposit in their bank. DESK isn’t like most cryptos, however.  “Because there’s no public market or exchange that gives us a fair market value for those tokens,” Flexa has to work 'directly with CoinDesk' on the transaction, Filter said. “It’s the same that we would do with an airline miles provider, for example. This is the first time that we’ve made a conference token spendable on our network.""  He sees the project as an “experiment” with upside. If it works well, he can use DESK as a proof-of-concept for pitching hotels and airlines on the evolution of loyalty points.  Origin of DESK  It’s not the first time a crypto thingamabob called DESK has reared its head at Consensus.  Last year, CoinDesk’s COVID-19-era ZoomCon gave DESK to virtual attendees. They too could use the engage-to-earn token on swag purchases and not much else. Built on the Rinkeby testnet, DESK 1.0 was at best crypto-lite: a tease at what CoinDesk conference coins could be.  The new DESK, by contrast, is a real-life crypto token. It lives atop the Polygon mainnet. It has an initial issuance of 5 billion. It was built following the ERC-20 token standard, and its holders – there are already nearly 6,000 – can do with their DESK as they please. So long as they don’t trade DESK on exchanges; that’s against the terms of service.  “Because it’s a non-monetized social token, DESK’s value does not come from its value on secondary markets,” Layden explained. “It comes from the value that we provide.”  CoinDesk’s value proposition for DESK holders is something akin to Disney Dollars: It has value within the brand ecosystem but is valueless everywhere else. Like airline miles, it rewards committed users with an alternative means to access in-house perks. Unlike airline miles, it lives on a public blockchain where transactions are irreversible and beyond the issuer’s control.  “It’s an experiment of ours to basically eat our own dog food and see the current state of blockchain tech,” Layden said.  CoinDesk is itself looking to DESK as a big bet, Layden said. He hinted at future potential integrations on the website and beyond. For now, the focus is on Consensus.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/06/06/the-story-of-desk-how-coindesk-built-its-social-token,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3a5b4e0f8495d4759d436867fde8164460b26e73-3024x2160.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421559,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXockX,1654542314,Crypto Can Overcome Its Reputation as a Weak Link in Financial Crime. Here's How,"The crypto sector is often painted as the weakest link in the fight against financial crime. More recently, it has been accused of posing a risk to financial stability and compromising investor security with its laissez-faire attitude toward cybersecurity.  But if you take the temperature of illicit activity linked to the crypto-asset ecosphere, it throws up some sharp contradictions.  It is true that crypto remains the payment mechanism of choice for narcotics and other illicit commodities on the darknet, but as law enforcement continues to reinforce its surveillance of these hawkers, such black markets are declining.  Unregulated crypto-asset exchanges continue to serve as means for state actors to circumvent barriers in the formal financial system. U.S. courts have just unsealed a memorandum opinion outlining the alleged role of a crypto-asset exchange in the processing of some $10 million in payments barred under international sanctions.  But the growth in crypto-asset forensic technology is now making it increasingly difficult to cash out criminal funds. Ten million is minute compared with the recovered $3.6 billion linked to the Bitfinex hack. There are other established, less complex methods for laundering criminal funds at scale.  Read More: How Not to Run a Cryptocurrency Exchange  Crypto assets get a bad rap, sometimes rightly but often not. Over recent months, the sector has enhanced its reputation by enabling and supporting efforts to raise funds for Ukraine to procure nonlethal equipment and humanitarian aid – as well as for Afghanistan despite that the war-torn country’s formal financial sector has come to an effective standstill.  Safeguarding wealth  In developing nations, more people are using crypto assets to keep their wealth safe from governmental restrictions and unlawful appropriation. Web 3 components, such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), offer the prospect of supporting marginalized groups – including the victims of online sexual exploitation – by the application of cryptographic solutions that enable ownership by consent.  A burgeoning, healthy and ethical crypto-asset industry can help prevent malign activity – and maybe, just maybe, change public and governmental perceptions.  For a first step in this direction, one might look to an estimate from Chainalysis: Earlier this year, the blockchain specialists said that transactions involving illicit wallets represented just 0.15% of cryptocurrency transaction volumes last year. Yet widespread skepticism remains, and machine learning and predictive analytics are not a panacea for malign activity.  Put aside, for one moment, a series of outrageous NFT ""rug pulls"" and barely concealed market-manipulation schemes. There are reasons to suppose financial crime is less prevalent than other regulated activities and eminently detectable – and therefore preventable.  For example, blockchain analytics can go further and faster than traditional finance to unravel the perpetrators of criminality. It is not flippant to say that, were the blockchain in existence at the time, the Watergate follow-the-money scandal or Bernie Madoff’s giant Ponzi scheme might have been stopped earlier.  Law enforcement, intelligence agencies, policymakers and the private sector are part of the same critical ecosystem fighting financial crime. If the entire system works together, the crypto sector could become a force leader.  Buy-in at all levels  How can historical and ongoing concerns be assuaged? Several quick wins come to mind.  The fight against financial crime starts with the implementation of a compliance-focused culture within the crypto sector. By prioritizing compliance as a fundamental pillar of how crypto firms operate, organizations will help change perceptions among regulators, law enforcement and traditional finance.  Read More: Are Crypto Assets Securities?  But buy-in must be achieved at all levels within an organization, supported by a strong tone from the top. This partly depends on refining the image of the sector away from ""crypto bros"" and profit before ethics. Philosophical debates about decentralization will not cut the mustard with regulators.  Without such organization-wide backing for compliance, the best systems, policies and controls will be washed away, heightening the risk of illicit proceeds getting into the system. The crypto-asset industry is in a good position to advocate and promote best practices internally, with the external benefit of assuaging broader concerns.  Organizations must actively seek practical solutions to prove their commitment. The sector has the opportunity to make a moral commitment to tackling the personal and societal harms inflicted by financial crime when it is enabled by crypto-asset technology – a crypto constitution, if you will.  In its simplest form, this means cultural change implemented by training and awareness building, an informed understanding of financial crime threats and a campaign to develop industry standards.  Start with a strong cross-sector statement outlining the policy (and all-important redlines) for dealing with crypto mixers and privacy coins.  Additionally, consider the opportunities for sharing actionable intelligence with banking partners. This will require support from regulators and established public-private partnerships. Crypto-asset service providers could reciprocate by instigating a pilot project testing nonbinding disclosure of information made possible under Section 314(b) of the USA Patriot Act.  A sandbox environment for joint training with law enforcement might stipulate what should happen were an investigation to cross over into the crypto-asset domain. This approach would help to address technological challenges, internal anti-money-laundering controls and an industry response to high-harm threats such as ransomware.  Consider the inherent advantages open to crypto assets – the immutability of the blockchain, its inherent traceability and a distributed ledger that can withstand criminal efforts to double-spend legitimate coins. These built-in advantages should bode well compared with repeated traditional finance scandals. With goodwill (on all sides), such quick wins might be building blocks for that bridge of trust.

42411785,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfzXf,1654535722,How Does USDC Work?,"USD Coin (USDC) is a stablecoin launched in 2018 by Centre, which is a consortium created by Circle and Coinbase. USDC is an open source protocol, which means anyone can use it — not just Circle and their partners.  USDC along with tether (USDT) equates to more than 80% of total market capitalization for all U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins. Though USDT has the largest market capitalization among all stablecoins, USDC has its advantages and differences among its peers.  What is the point of USDC?  USDC is basically a tokenized version of the U.S. dollar (USD). It is fully redeemable, meaning you can trade it for the same amount of cash you deposited to create your account. USDC provides customers with a fast and cost-effective way to transfer value quickly anywhere in the world. Unlike some stablecoins linked to the price of a single asset or basket of assets, USDC's value is tied directly to the U.S. dollar. USDC reserves are held in segregated accounts in the United States with regulated U.S. financial institutions in the form of cash and short-duration U.S. Treasuries.  The USDC protocol was made to provide better access to cryptocurrencies to the general public. The goal behind USDC is to help the cryptocurrency sector become more user-friendly.  USDC was also developed in order to be used by businesses and individuals alike. As USDC provides an open-source smart contract, this allows other companies to develop their own blockchain products, such as wallets and exchanges. However, those who want to use the U.S. dollar as a payment or reward system for their customers, employees or partners can access these services easily through USDC's Payouts solution.  How does USDC work?  USDC was developed to be used in place of the U.S. dollar in the crypto world and make it easy to exchange and use it. As it's pegged to the U.S. dollar, you can rely on its consistent value even as the value of other cryptocurrencies fluctuate.  As a retail user, to convert your U.S. dollars or whatever fiat money you have into USDC, you'll need to do three things:  Register an account with a partner exchange that supports USDC.  Deposit fiat currency into your account with the exchange by way of wire transfer, credit card or bank account.  Buy USDC with your fiat currency.  On the other hand, you can convert your USDC into fiat currency by doing the following:  A user asks the exchange platform to convert any number of USDC tokens for fiat.  The exchange then sends a request to the USDC smart contract to convert their tokens for fiat and remove an equivalent number of tokens from circulation.  The issuer sends back your requested amount of fiat to your bank account equaling the USDC tokens minus incurred fees.  Accredited investors and businesses can get USDC directly from Circle by signing up for a Circle Account.  In contrast to other stablecoins, the team behind USDC commits to providing complete transparency and partners with financial institutions in maintaining its fiat reserves – a unique feature for a stablecoin. USDC exchanges and partners are obligated to report their U.S. dollar holdings regularly.  Read more: What's the Point of Stablecoins? Understanding Why They Exist  Difference between USDC and other stablecoins  USDC is a stablecoin that is issued by Circle. Circle and Coinbase formed the Centre Consortium as a governing body for USDC.  Among the differences between USDC and other stablecoins is that, according to Circle’s site, “USDC reserves are kept in the custody of leading U.S. financial institutions, including BlackRock and Bank of New York Mellon. Cash is held at US financial institutions; US Treasuries are held at third party custodians.”  USDC has been used as a substitute for U.S. dollars on major exchanges, such as Coinbase, Kraken, Binance, Poloniex and Gemini.  Primarily, USDC differs from other stablecoins in three general ways:  USDC has been transparent and proactive in creating safeguards in the event of a future government investigation.   USDC is fully backed by fiat collateral and not dependent on the potential future value of its use case or the value of other cryptocurrencies like some other stablecoins are.  USDC issuance is regulated pursuant to U.S. state money transmission supervision and is subject to ongoing examination of Circle and its operations.  Many regulated institutions have been hesitant to enter the crypto market because of its lack of regulation and security. As USDC is fully backed by cash and U.S. Treasuries, one of USDC's core value propositions is that a financial institution can hold it without fear of fluctuation. This is an important step forward for the crypto market, as it allows regulated institutions to begin offering crypto products without worrying about volatility risk.  Final thoughts on USDC  Purchasing USDC won't provide any investment returns for buyers because it was designed to be a stablecoin. However, the benefits of buying this cryptocurrency are more about how useful it is rather than how much money you can make from an increase in price.

Now that many industries have integrated blockchain technology, which are the latest industries jumping aboard the trend of fractionalization? How can it improve accessibility to the market of high-end collectibles? Read on to find out. Driven by fast-paced blockchain technology adoption, the concept of fractional ownership has had a recent increase in its usage and familiarity on the world scene. As a result, what was once an idea understood mainly by those operating in the stock market is now part of the vernacular of newcomers to the world of investments and crypto. The world has just begun getting used to the idea of ownership of digital assets via NFTs, but typically that ownership would pertain to only one buyer at a time. Last March, history was made when a Beeple NFT was sold for $69 million to collector MetaKoven. While attention was drawn to the price tag, it was also interesting that MetaKoven had bought several of Beeple&apos;s works before the record-breaking piece, only to divide the ownership into blockchain-based tokens then and sell them to the public. It was a prime example of fractionalizing a digital asset, and we&apos;re about to see a lot more of these types of investment opportunities on offer in the years to come.

42421551,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXocdJ,1654532673,New York Mining 'Ban' Is a Green Opportunity,"Late last week, New York’s Senate passed a moratorium impacting bitcoin mining in the state. It’s not a ban of proof-of-work mining per se, but instead a two-year freeze on starting up new bitcoin mining facilities that rely on carbon-based fuel.  That bill, having cleared two legislative bodies, will now have to be signed into law by Gov. Kathy Hochul. Whether it passes or not, mining at home or starting new industrial plants that use renewable sources of energy would still be allowed.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Although the moratorium, limited as it is, will likely discourage bitcoin miners from setting up shop in the state, it could be seen as an opportunity. During the two-year freeze, active bitcoin miners and even new businesses looking to hang their shingle can proactively go green.  New York will also study the environmental impact of proof-of-work mining during the moratorium. The bill's sponsors said they are primarily concerned with the trend of bitcoin miners reopening decommissioned carbon-based power plants, like Greenidge Generation in Dresden, New York.  See also: New York's Latest Anti-Crypto Action (Podcast)  Bitcoin mining is not a black box. The open network provides a large amount of data related to its operations. We have a decent understanding of who is mining bitcoin, and how many people use it. (According to a recent Federal Reserve survey, about 6 million Americans used crypto for payments with about 60% having annual incomes lower than $50,000.)  It’s also highly adaptable to sudden changes – for instance, after China tried to totally curtail all crypto activities in the country, many miners simply packed up their ASICs and shifted to Kazakhstan and the United States (including New York).  Although the bitcoin mining industry has become highly corporatized, and those businesses may be resistant to finding alternative energy sources, speaking optimistically it’s possible for the network to go green.  To mine bitcoin you need specialized computer chips, the bitcoin software and an energy stream. That’s why we’ve seen operations spring up in far-flung places, like miners that capture otherwise wasted energy from flared gas in, say, Siberia.  Bitcoin miners in New York should take the first move to build out renewable infrastructure or increase demand for greener utilities in the state. It’s not an alien idea: Prominent bitcoin advocates, including Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, have argued that bitcoin mining could incentivize the build-out of wind and solar farms.  Indeed, it’s not out of the question that the Bitcoin network becomes an integral part of the global renewable industry. Mining facilities could bring in revenues for energy producers and also turn on or off depending on demand. (In Texas, for instance, miners have been responsive to grid load and have dialed down during times of peak demand.)  Bitcoin’s economic prospects are at least part of the reason why so many have opposed New York’s moratorium. Sen. Jeremy Cooney (D-Rochester) opposed the bill. The crypto miner Foundry is based in his district. (Disclosure: Foundry is owned by CoinDesk parent Digital Currency Group.)  Moreover, earlier this year, chair of the Senate Environmental Conservation Committee and the author of New York's Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, Todd Kaminsky, which requires the state to get to net-zero electricity by 2040, spoke out against the bill. Likewise, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) also wrote a memorandum of opposition to an earlier draft last year.  Further, you can ban bitcoin to meet misguided environmental goals, but the activity will only shift elsewhere. Venture capitalist Nic Carter drew a comparison to the U.S. federal ban on gold  in the 20th century, which only caused a boost in production and the price of the asset. New Yorkers may not want a miner in their backyard, but if these facilities are drawing on renewables that’s clearly better than having ASICs shipped over to less sustainable regions.  See also: Middle East Oil Producers Move Into Bitcoin Mining With Crusoe Energy Stakes  True, the challenge is weighing the concerns of environmentalists like Kaminsky, politicians like Cooney and unions like the IBEW over other constituents. Some residents near Greenidge have raised concerns that the reactivated plant is warming Seneca Lake.  And then, even within the crypto industry, there are players who want to change Bitcoin at a protocol level – shifting from the energy-intensive proof-of-work algorithm to proof-of-stake. Although backed by some powerful groups, including Greenpeace, this plan is unworkable given that nobody controls Bitcoin and reaching consensus on changes to the network is hard to achieve.  Proof-of-work is energy-intensive, but it’s also precisely what gives bitcoin its value. That’s a complicated debate, but suffice it to say that although the Bitcoin network has been updated at the end of the day, whatever bitcoin is is what the community says. And so, bitcoin’s users demand proof-of-work.  But you don’t have to change the code if you can change the situation on the ground. Two years is a long time in the 13-year-old system’s history, and Bitcoin could reinvent itself. But first, it has to invest in going green because this issue is not going away.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | REGULATION,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/06/06/new-york-mining-ban-is-a-green-opportunity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c4bb8335eb1aa5293cb5fb79de45f2e617e8f441-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Now, for the first time since 2019, Consensus is live and in person, taking its Big Tent to Austin, Texas, home to a thriving artist community and known for its breakfast tacos, BBQ, music and film festivals, and for being a startup hub. What better place to dive into creative entrepreneurship than Consensus 2022 at Austin?  This guide is part of CoinDesk's Road to Consensus series.  Non-fungible tokens (NFT), the metaverse and decentralization have all exploded in possibility and adoption in recent years, accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic that drove us all behind closed doors and open laptops, promising to create an opportunity for artists and creators to bypass brokers, agents and other middlemen, find an audience and be financially rewarded. If you are a creator, here’s what to attend at Consensus 2022 to learn about the latest ideas and innovations in creative entrepreneurship.  Thursday, June 9  The can’t-miss Creator Summit at the Main Stage of the Hilton Austin is a chockablock half-day of a dozen conversations bringing creators and business people together. It kicks off at 1 p.m. local time with a welcome address by Sterling Proffer, founder of Creative Executive Officers, invited by CoinDesk to program and host the Creator Summit with the goal of showing creators, artists, musicians, platforms and fans how to utilize the benefits of blockchain technology.

End the Creator Summit on a hopeful but cautionary note with ""Building a Better Future,"" back on the Main Stage from 4:35 p.m. to 5:15 p.m. Turning the promise of Web 3 into a reality means we must consciously avoid replicating the old system on new rails.

42374439,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZVm3,1654531200,DESK Updates,"DESK is CoinDesk’s social token, launched in May 2022 and designed to reward active members of the CoinDesk community. DESK’s initial use case is as the social token at the 2022 Consensus festival. CoinDesk plans to use DESK beyond Consensus, and is currently preparing systems where DESK can act as a feedback loop between the company and its audience.  This blog is intended to serve as a ledger for transparency, recording DESK’s key milestones.  Learn more about DESK in the following CoinDesk articles:  DESK Is Back: CoinDesk Relaunches Social Token Into the Wild  What Is DESK? CoinDesk’s Social Token, Explained  Get Started With DESK: How to Set Up Your Wallet  Tokenomics  DESK is a non-monetized social token: Its goal is to activate community value and social utility - not to increase or even stabilize value beyond its own closed ecosystem.  DESK’s initial goal is to be the social fuel of Consensus 2022, but CoinDesk plans to broaden the token experience after the event. Because of this, DESK’s tokenomics are designed to be flexible with room to grow.  We have minted 5 billion DESK and plan to use these tokens to establish DESK’s foundation. That said, we’re able to burn and mint at will, allowing us to refine the tokenomics as we build out the full ecosystem.  We’ve used airline miles as a mental model for developing our engagement-centric distribution model, i.e. each audience member earns rewards proportional to the depth of their engagement.  Similar to the promotional strategy used by airlines, we’re able to inject additional value into parts of our ecosystem where engagement has elevated requirements such as buying a ticket to Consensus.  Consensus 2022 is the first step of the DESK project, and our approach to its tokenomics will evolve as we continue to explore and experiment with this element of building in Web 3.  DESK Dashboard  The DESK Dashboard on coindesk.com allows users to create an account that will serve as a portal to all things DESK. Users can join the DESK Dashboard to keep track of their DESK; join our Discord server; find DESK quests; shop the NFTify Marketplace; and more.  Collecting and Redeeming DESK  Initially, issuance and use of the DESK token will be limited to the 2022 Consensus festival taking place in Austin, Texas, June 9-12. Attendees were invited to participate in limited DESK airdrops in the weeks leading up to Consensus. During the festival, attendees can collect DESK by participating in festival activities, e.g., attending sessions, visiting specific locations and attending parties. Consensus attendees will have opportunities to trade their accumulated DESK for food, drinks and novelty items.  Find more information on collecting and redeeming DESK at Consensus here.

The capital will go towards hiring, product development and expanding offerings to publicly traded companies and institutions, according to a press release provided to CoinDesk.  Other participants in the round included BlueYard Capital, Alven, CoinShares, Avantgarde Finance, Protocol Labs and Draper Associates, among others.  The Cryptio accounting and reporting platform was set up to help financial institutions, corporations and crypto-native businesses create auditable records from fragmented decentralized finance (DeFi), custody and exchange data for the purposes of accounting, treasury and tax filings. The collected data can be connected to the customer’s traditional accounting software like Xero or QuickBooks.  Cryptio’s service includes a cross-chain blockchain data layer with a reporting layer built on top, founder and CEO Antoine Scalia told CoinDesk in an interview. The new funding will help build out the blockchain data and scale the reporting layer to work for the largest institutional investors who need to automate accounting and tax reporting in the space.  The company client list includes more than 200 crypto-native firms, including MetaMask creator Consensys, open-source liquidity protocol Aave and virtual gaming world The Sandbox.  In the near term, Cryptio plans to release a reporting module for impairment testing – an accounting procedure that checks whether an asset has drastically dropped in value. On the blockchain side, the firm will release more complicated DeFi tracking, said Scalia.  “A back-office infrastructure designed for crypto is one of the most critical yet still missing infrastructures in order to enable broader corporate adoption of token-based financial products,” said Point Nine partner Louis Coppey in the press release.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/06/cryptio-raises-10m-to-make-crypto-accounting-easier,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/490208cebadb189a273bd3bb213ca357171c13a0-5000x3750.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Regulators and lawmakers will be out in force to discuss how they’re approaching the rapidly growing cryptocurrency sector.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Austin party  The narrative  Hey folks. CoinDesk’s Consensus 2022, our first IRL event since 2019, kicks off this week. I previewed our regulatory track earlier this week, which you can read below. We also have panels discussing central bank digital currencies and discussions addressing a whole range of issues in various parts of the crypto world.  Why it matters  It’s finally here! Say hi if you’re in town, and if you see me in the hallways of the Austin Convention Center, ask me for a CoinDesk sticker.  Breaking it down  It is going to be a WEEK y'all. Regular readers of this newsletter might enjoy a few of the panels we have.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission – a regulatory agency we’ve talked about quite a bit in recent months – will start things off on Thursday, June 9, at 10:05 a.m. CT, with Chair Rostin Behnam and former Commissioner Dawn Stump discussing the regulator’s role in the sector.  Advocates for different approaches to central bank digital currencies and similar types of payment tools will likewise take the stage at the Fairmont Hotel to try and find an answer to the question, “Who should be allowed to issue digital dollars?” Hear from Dante Disparte, the chief strategy officer at stablecoin issuer Circle; Rohan Grey, an academic who advised on the ECASH Act; and Caitlin Long, the founder and CEO of Wyoming’s Custodia Bank.  On Friday, June 10, we’ll host a Q&A session with Deputy Treasury Secretary Adewale Adeyemo at 10:45 a.m. CT on the Main Stage of the Austin Convention Center. The Treasury Department has been active in crypto over the past 18 months, looking at issues ranging from ransomware payments to stablecoin regulation.  Reminder: I’m looking for questions for Mr. Adeyemo! If you have one, send it to me via email.  The “Regulation” exploration, taking place in the ACC Ballroom A on Friday, June 10 at 1 p.m. CT, will feature three panels with representatives from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, industry associations and law firms steeped in cryptocurrency issues. Panelists will discuss finding a regulatory “sweet spot” to support novel projects while still mitigating the chances of another project collapsing in a dramatic fashion and harming investors.  We’re looking for questions for this panel, too! Same deal as above – shoot me an email folks.  On the same day, at 2:30 p.m. CT, we’ll host several lawmakers on our Main Stage to discuss crypto legislation, the likelihood of any specific legislation passing and what issues Congress sees as the most vital in the cryptocurrency sector.  We’ll continue the discussion on crypto policy and borders Saturday at 4:05 p.m. CT in the Convention Center, with White House Director for Cybersecurity Carole House, Bahamas Prime Minister Philip Davis, Monetary Authority of Singapore Chief FinTech Officer Sopnendu Mohanty and European Parliament Vice President Eva Kaili.  You can get the tl;dr on other sessions through our Road to Consensus series, such as our guide on the CBDC panels.  By the way, lest you think this is all that’s going on this week: On Tuesday, June 7 at 10 a.m. ET, the Senate Homeland Security Committee will hold a hearing on ransomware and cryptocurrency, while the House Homeland Security Committee subcommittee on Intelligence and Counterterrorism will hold a hearing on terrorism and crypto Thursday, June 9, at 9 a.m. ET.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  Oh jeez, this is a busy week huh.  Elsewhere:  Cawthorn’s Crypto Wallet Reveals Undisclosed Trades Amid House Ethics Investigation: CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson took a look at what we know about U.S. Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) and his undisclosed crypto holdings and identified his wallet and trades.  New York State Senate Passes Bitcoin Mining Moratorium: The New York State Senate passed a bill that would impose a two-year moratorium on bitcoin mining powered by behind-the-meter carbon-based energy sources during a (really) late-night session.  Environmentalists Target Greenidge as They Turn Up Pressure on NY Governor to Sign Mining Moratorium Bill: The New York Assembly already passed the bill, meaning it now sits before Governor Kathy Hochul. The bill’s sponsors and advocates held a press conference to discuss it on Friday.  Outside CoinDesk:  (Hard Drive) Shoutout to whoever was running Hard Drive’s Twitter feed just at that moment.  (Bloomberg) The White House will publish a policy recommendation addressing the energy concerns around crypto mining in the coming weeks, Bloomberg reported.  (BuzzFeed News) Some folks tried to make a Goblintown NFT collection knockoff which was in turn hijacked, apparently.

I’m Bradley Keoun, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights. (Lyllah Ledesma is off.)  Price point: Bitcoin finally posts a winning week, snapping record losing streak. Friday's U.S. CPI report for May could show inflation slowing.  Market Moves: Decentralized exchanges are winning on-chain flows, Cameron Thompson reports.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) was higher Monday, after snapping a record nine-week losing streak.  As of press time bitcoin was up 6.2% over the past 24 hours, to about $31,500.  During the seven days through Sunday, the bitcoin price inched up 1.5% – barely mentionable for the notoriously volatile cryptocurrency except for the fact that it was the first weekly gain in 10 weeks. From late March through late May, a steady market erosion took bitcoin from about $48,000 to as low as $25,400.  Now analysts are wondering if the latest price bounce might mean the bottom is in.  ""The new week is off to a promising start,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email. ""It is worth paying attention to the change in the trend.""  Cardano's ADA token, Solana's SOL and Polygon's MATIC tokens were all enjoying double-digit-percentage gains on Monday.  In traditional markets, U.S. stock futures were higher along with European indexes. Traders were awaiting a European Central Bank meeting later this week where officials led by President Christine Lagarde are expected to announce an end to bond purchases and signal rate increases ahead, likely in July – part of a campaign to head off surging inflation.  The big economic data point in the U.S. this week will be the Consumer Price Index report on Friday, June 10. The CPI report could provide clues as to how the economy is responding to the Federal Reserve's campaign to slow inflation.  According to FactSet, economists estimate the CPI for May probably was probably 8.2% higher than 12 months ago, representing a decrease from April's pace of 8.3% and March's 8.5%.  Market moves  Decentralized exchanges are winning on-chain flows, Cameron Thompson reports.  Decentralized exchanges (DEX) are rising in popularity.  From April 2021 to April 2022, Web 3 users sent $224 billion in on-chain value to DEXs, outstripping centralized exchanges like Coinbase which combined for $175 billion over the same period, according to Chainalysis.  Chainalysis Economist Ethan McMahon told CoinDesk that the move from centralized exchanges (CEX) to DEXs began in 2020’s DeFi summer and carried through the NFT boom of 2021. DEXs first cleared 50% market share in September 2020, according to the report. In June 2021, the number hit its peak at 80%. Based on the latest report, the market share now stands around 55%.  If DEXs continue to increase in popularity, a regulatory crackdown might be on the way. “If [regulation] serves as a hindrance, it may actually reduce the market share,” said McMahon.

Hut 8 mined 309 bitcoins or 10 per day during May, unchanged from the previous month. The entirety of the self-mined bitcoins were deposited into custody, “consistent with Hut 8's long-standing HODL strategy,” according to a statement.  The company’s action is notable given that many of its mining peers are starting to sell some of their mined bitcoins as prices tumble and funding in capital markets becomes more difficult and expensive. Riot Blockchain (RIOT) – one of the largest publicly traded miners and also a previously confirmed hodler – recently announced a third consecutive month of bitcoin sales.  Hut 8 also concluded its bitcoin yield program in which it had loaned out 1,000 BTC to Genesis at an interest rate of 2%, and 1,000 BTC to Galaxy at 2.25%. This brings those 2,000 bitcoin back into the custody of Hut 8.  As of May 31, the company held 7,078 bitcoins in its reserves. At a price of $30,000 per coin, this has a value of $212.3 million vs. Hut 8’s market cap of $400 million (press time price of BTC is $31,500).  Also as of May 31, Hut 8’s installed operating capacity was 2.64 exahash per second (EH/s). Operations began at the company’s third mine in North Bay, Ontario on June 2, adding about 400 petahash per second (PH/s) to capacity (or 0.4 EH/s).  Shares of the miner were flat Monday morning despite a modest bounce in the price of bitcoin. Hut 8 is off about 71% year-to-date, in line with most of its mining peers.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/06/crypto-miner-hut-8-bucks-trend-by-hodling-its-mined-bitcoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a3ee88abb35a21d70b699928f016bb53e982b0b1-1100x615.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Bitcoin Mining Moratorium was authorized by the New York State Senate on June 3. However, the contentious bill was narrowly passed, with only 57 percent of the total votes in favor. It has not been fully implemented since New York Governor Kathy Hochul must sign it, which is likely this week. After the voting, State Assembly Member Anna Kelles claimed that the bill was a ban, arguing that it would &apos;restrict&apos; specific types of bitcoin mining for two years in the state. The problem is that legislators in the United States have a poor understanding of the crypto sector, mining, and related technology.

Nonetheless, they are rising in popularity.  From April 2021 to April 2022, Web 3 users sent $224 billion in on-chain value to DEXs, outstripping centralized exchanges like Coinbase, which combined for $175 billion over the same period, according to a new report from Chainalysis.  While those figures don’t speak to bottom-line trading volumes, they do highlight how DEXs offer a viable alternative to CEXs. But a transition from CEXs to DEXs raises concerns as to how this growing sector of crypto will be regulated. Decentralized exchanges are self-executing, and for better or for worse lack the human element of centralized exchanges. That means they’re harder to regulate.  Chainalysis Economist Ethan McMahon told CoinDesk that the move from CEXs to DEXs began in 2020’s DeFi Summer and carried through the non-fungible token (NFT) boom of 2021. DEXs first cleared 50% market share in September 2020, according to the report. In June 2021, this number hit its peak at 80%.  When asked about the future DEX dominance, McMahon said regulation will likely play a role in these numbers.  While decentralized exchanges are noncustodial and offer a wider range of currency pairs, according to McMahon, they aren’t as easy to use and do not offer the same regulatory assurance that centralized exchanges do. If DEXs continue to increase in popularity, a regulatory crackdown might be on the way.  “If [regulation] serves as a hindrance, it may actually reduce the market share,” McMahon said.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/06/decentralized-exchanges-beat-centralized-counterparts-for-on-chain-flows-chainalysis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e268eeb4bfab86cb4a6f0253636ae6284653c556-5184x3888.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Indian Govt Might Provide Relief to the 1% TDS According to a local media report, the Indian government might provide relief on the 1 percent tax-at-source applicable on cryptocurrency trades.

42423195,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2X5Bh,1654498800,Antsy Lithuania Latest to Anticipate EU Crypto Law With One of Its Own,"Lithuania is the latest impatient member of the European Union seeking to jump the gun by creating its own crypto licensing regime, because EU laws might come too late to safeguard the sector’s reputation, local ministers told CoinDesk.  With Brussels’ landmark law – the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA) – potentially not in force until 2025, the Baltic nation wants to do its “homework” in advance, the country’s deputy finance minister told CoinDesk. But the plans for the law, which is set to be debated in the country’s parliament, are making some companies based in Lithuania fear for their future.  The EU is in the final stages of negotiating MiCA. The single authorization regime for the bloc of 27 nations has been years coming and could transform the sector by allowing businesses to tap a market of hundreds of millions. Some countries, however, can’t wait to grab their slice of the burgeoning sector.  The European Commission, the EU's governing body, first asked for advice on how existing regulations apply to crypto in March 2018. Since then, crypto uptake has ballooned, and entire initiatives such as the Facebook-backed Libra, then renamed Diem, were born and died.  Even once lawmakers iron out their final wrinkles in the law, like how to treat Libra-like stablecoins, non-fungible tokens and decentralized finance, there will be a transition period for as long as two years before MiCA takes effect.  Read more: EU Commission Favors Ban on Large-Scale Stablecoins, Document Shows  “MiCA is kind of the biggest thing that's upcoming, it's a good decision; we support it,” Mindaugas Liutvinskas, vice minister in the Lithuanian ministry of finance, told CoinDesk in an interview. “But before we get there, it's, what? 2025, end of 2024; we still have quite a lot of time.  “What we decided to do is take practice steps, do all our homework, to strengthen our regulatory framework,” he said, calling his proposed law a “quick fix” that MiCA can then take “to the next level.”  Image problem  Liutvinskas is worried that unless he acts fast, less upstanding companies might bring down the sector’s image.  “For both the government and market participants, the worst-case scenario would be to have some sort of a bad situation, some sort of scandal in terms of money laundering or circumventing sanctions,” he said. “Reputation is an essential resource in this line of business.”  Read more: In Estonia, the Party’s Over for 'Hippie' Crypto Firms  Like regulators in Estonia, Liutvinskas says he welcomes sound companies, but not empty shells that merely register in the country but operate from elsewhere.  The main provisions of the proposed law have already been published in draft and will be presented to parliament in early summer. They include a MiCA-style requirement to hold 125,000 euros ($133,000) in capital and to have anti-money-laundering staff physically based in the country. The industry, meanwhile, is hoping that measures will be brought in on a slower timeline.  Capital  Liutvinskas has already agreed not to implement money-laundering identity checks right away, not least because it’s not clear what the EU will expect. Negotiations were thrown up in the air by what he calls “out-of-the-box thinking” from the European Parliament, which wants a tighter grip on transactions with crypto wallets not hosted by a regulated exchange.  And it’s in this area where his proposals appear to have drawn criticism from the crypto sector, which complains Lithuania is going it alone in a global market, given that in practice many jurisdictions worldwide haven't yet implemented norms set by the Financial Action Task Force, a global anti-money-laundering watchdog.  Requirements on virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to identify their customers, even for the smallest of transactions, “do not make sense,” with administrative burdens out of proportion to the risk, said Agnė Smagurauskaitė, legal counsel at CoinGate, a Lithuania-based payment and trading company.  “VASPs in other jurisdictions will not have the same obligation for data sharing which makes it close to impossible to transact with them,” she told CoinDesk in an email. And the lack of an equivalent to the banking-sector messaging service SWIFT means information may not be secure, she said.  See also: Cyprus Deputy Minister on Drafting Crypto Bill Ahead of EU Regulatory Framework  She says she supports measures to make markets more transparent and trustworthy, but not those that kill innovation or the ability to compete.  In the draft bill, “there are some points that completely destroy Lithuania's VASP market,” she said.  Tweaks  There may yet be more tweaks in the offing for a law that Liutvinskas admits isn't yet “fully cut into stone.” But other industry representatives reckon the new legislation, which could be in force by later this year, won’t do any damage to the country’s status as a crypto hub.  Companies “usually don't like” stricter rules being introduced, Kęstutis Kvainauskas, a lawyer based at consultancy Ecovis ProventusLaw, told CoinDesk, but he said that “Lithuanian requirements actually are still considered as quite liberal.”  Read more: EU Parliament Passes Privacy-Busting Crypto Rules Despite Industry Criticism  The direction of travel, toward MiCA-style rules, is inevitable, Kvainauskas believes, and maybe smaller jurisdictions are just trying to get ahead of the game.  “At the moment, I do not see other jurisdictions able to offer something similar [to what] Lithuania can offer,” with authorization offering wide access to markets across Europe, he said.  U.K. emigrants  The country might even prove an attractive home to companies fleeing places like Estonia or the U.K., where, Kvainauskas notes, the Financial Conduct Authority, the U.K.'s financial regulator, has seemed to be unwilling to extend its current temporary registration regime.  Liutvinskas might balk at the idea that companies are merely seeking the jurisdiction with the lightest rules, saying that the practice known as regulatory arbitrage “is not something that we want to have.”  But, Liutvinskas added, Lithuania is “an innovation-friendly fintech friendly jurisdiction…. We welcome all innovative businesses that have sound business models.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/06/06/antsy-lithuania-latest-to-anticipate-eu-crypto-law-with-one-of-its-own,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2e7ef419240eb80e77c4345fa848b885a51e59cb-7360x4912.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and other major cryptos trade rise slightly.  Insights: Stablecoins face increasing scrutiny.

And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading just above $30,000, up slightly from Friday but still in the doldrums. Bitcoin has been ticking a little above and below this threshold since early May, depending on the day's events as investors nervously await clear signs about the direction of inflation and the global economy.  ""BTC remains weak until it conclusively breaches the $31k to $32k range,"" Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull, wrote to CoinDesk. ""However, we continue to see some buying below $30K that is keeping the price afloat.""  Ether, the second largest crypto by market cap, was recently changing hands just above $1,800, up slightly over the same period and well within the range it's held over the last two two weeks under $2,000. Other major cryptos were about flat, although mostly on the green side with LINK and ADA among the biggest winners, rising 5% and 3%, respectively. Trading was light as is typical on most weekends.  Cryptos' weekend holding pattern veered slightly away from equity indices, which closed down on Friday with the tech-focused Nasdaq plunging 2.4% and the S&P 500 falling 1.6%. Digital assets and stocks have correlated increasingly in recent months.  On a more upbeat note, a better-than-expected U.S. jobs report on Friday, showing that nonfarm payrolls added about 390,000 jobs in May, suggested that the economy was far from ready to fold. Analysts have been concerned that the U.S. central bank's interest rate hikes will throw the U.S. economy into recession. And in a sliver of possible good news for crypto, shares of investor savant Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation ETF, which includes crypto exchange Coinbase, have risen over 15% since the second week in May. Wood's as been a noted Bitcoin advocate.  Still, crypto traders remain bearish as evidenced by last week's downturn in the Fear & Greed Index. BitBull's DiPasquale sees a greater likelihood of Bitcoin tumbling from its current perch than breaking out. ""We are expecting some directional action in the coming week or so, as Bitcoin either breaks out of the current range or breaks down to look for a lower low,"" he wrote. ""Currently, the probability of a breakdown appears higher than a break upwards.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,108 -1.6%  DJIA: 32,899 -1%  Nasdaq: 12,012 -2.4%  Gold: $1,852 +0.09%  Insights  Another Challenging Week for Stablecoins  First South Korea. Then Japan.  Stablecoin protocols finished another bumpy week of increased regulation and scrutiny.  The protocols that peg a digital asset to a fiat currency, commodity or a mathematical formula based on some group of assets have been on the defensive since the collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin (UST) token in early May. Observers of stablecoins, which are supposed to be lower risk than other digital assets, anticipated the extra attention, particularly for algorithm-based stablecoins such as UST.  On Friday, Japan's parliament passed a legal framework around stablecoins to protect investors, making the country one of the first first major economies to pass a stablecoin-specific law. The legislation, which goes into effect in a year, clarifies the definition of stablecoins as digital money that must be linked to the yen or another legal tender and guarantees holders the right to redeem them at face value. The bill does not address existing asset-backed or algorithmic stablecoins.  Only licensed banks, registered money transfer agents and trust companies can now issue stablecoins, although Japanese exchanges do not list them.  The law followed less than two weeks after a report in the Korea Times that South Korean financial authorities would introduce measures to hold crypto exchanges to greater scrutiny following the implosion of UST and the LUNA token behind it. A two-day National Assembly emergency seminar to discuss the debacle, which may have victimized about 280,000 South Koreans, considered the role of exchanges and law enforcement, among other topics.  ""We need to make exchanges play their proper role, and toward that end it is crucial for watchdogs to supervise them thoroughly,"" Rep. Sung Il-jong of the ruling People Power Party said. ""When exchanges violate rules, they should be held legally responsible to ensure that the market functions well without any troubles.""  The country's Financial Services Commission plans to build close ties with law enforcers ""to monitor any illegal acts in the industry and protect investors' rights,"" said its vice chair, Kim So-young.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Weighed Down by $34K Resistance, Support at $20K-$25K  Bitcoin (BTC) continues to face strong resistance at its 50-day moving average, which currently sits at $34,000.  The cryptocurrency has been anchored to the $30,000 price level over the past two weeks, absorbing a majority of trading volume. That could point to volatile price moves later this month.  On the daily chart, bitcoin's relative strength index (RSI) is stuck below the 50 neutral mark, which indicates slowing momentum behind the recent upswing in price. The persistent decline in momentum means BTC's six-month downtrend remains intact.  The weekly RSI is the most oversold since March 2020, which preceded an uptrend in price. This time, however, upside appears to be limited because of negative long-term momentum signals.  Still, over the short term, BTC could stabilize above the $20,000-$25,000 support zone. The 200-week moving average, currently at $22,179, is another gauge of long-term trend support.  BTC is on watch for a countertrend bullish signal, per the DeMark indicators, which could appear over the next two weeks. That could pave the way for a short-term price bounce, which would delay additional breakdowns on the chart. Upside moves could be fleeting, however, with secondary support at $17,673 providing a more stable ground for capitulation.
