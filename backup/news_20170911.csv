42427743,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3Yzh,1505163619,Tor and More: Bitcoin Market OpenBazaar Adds Features in 2.0 Beta Release,"The team behind the open-source, bitcoin-powered marketplace OpenBazaar has published the beta version of its forthcoming 2.0 release.  The launch, announced over the weekend, delivers a number of additions that developers outlined back in February. Among those is an integration with The Onion Router (Tor) network, enabling anonymous access to the marketplace network, as well as upgrades intended to boost overall up-times and access to storefronts.  It's a major development for the project, which seeks to decentralize online retailing in the way bitcoin decentralized value transfers. Back in February, Brian Hoffman, chief executive of OB1 (the startup behind the project), said that one of the goals for the 2.0 release was to make the user experience akin to popular e-commerce platforms like Etsy.  ""Our goal with OpenBazaar 2.0 is to get it to be, with the exception of using bitcoin, ... an identical experience of what you’d see on Etsy. I think the 2.0 [version] is close to that,"" he said at the time.  The new OpenBazaar is built on the InterPlanetary File System, a protocol for decentralized file storage and sharing. This means that its listings can be re-uploaded, by other users, allowing purchases to be made even when a store isn't directly connected to the internet.  While it displays real listings of goods and services offered for real bitcoins, the 2.0 version of OpenBazaar is, as advertised, still in the beta phase. In a blog post accompanying the release, the team cautioned that the system tends to overestimate fees and contains others other bugs they are working to fix.  Third-party search engines such as Duo can now be accessed in the OpenBazaar client in the new version. Previously, users had use a separate browser to use such tools, and then connect to OpenBazaar when they wanted to make purchases.  The new version also adds tools for vendors such as variants (e.g., is that sweater size small, medium or large?), inventory tracking and expanded shipping options.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in OB1, the company formed to further development of the OpenBazaar software.

42427746,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3ZFh,1505159152,'Revolutionary': Finland Central Bank Paper Heaps Praise on Bitcoin,"A research paper published by Finland's central bank has dubbed bitcoin's economic system ""revolutionary.""  In a new paper released on September 5 by the Bank of Finland, researchers from Columbia Business School revealed the results of an investigation into the ins and outs of bitcoin's infrastructure, as well as their finding that the technology constitutes a ""monopoly run by a protocol."" The paper was released by the bank's Research Unit.  Overall, the three authors – Gur Huberman, Jacob Leshno and Ciamac Moallemi – contend that this characteristic offers a degree of protection against manipulation by bad actors by virtue of the protocol-layer dynamics.  The group write:  ""Bitcoin is a monopoly run by a protocol, not by a managing organization. Familiar monopolies are run by managing organizations with discretion to determine and then change prices, offerings and rules. Monopolies are often regulated to prevent or at least mitigate their abuse of power.""  Other notable assertions featured in the paper include the argument that, because of this state of affairs, bitcoin itself ""cannot be regulated.""  ""Bitcoin cannot be regulated. There is no need to regulate it because as a system it is committed to the protocol as is and the transaction fees it charges the users are determined by the users independently of the miners’ efforts,"" the authors state.  Though the document itself states that the views enclosed don't represent the official stance of the Bank of Finland, the publication is undoubtedly a notable one given the central bank's involvement with the tech to date.  Last year, it organized a seminar on blockchain that included regulators, local academics and companies in an effort to support local research – a move spurred further along by the government as well. The city of Kouvola in Finland, for example, received €2.4m to test blockchain-powered shipping.  The paper's authors closed by advocating for deeper research by other academics.  ""[Bitcoin's] apparent functionality and usefulness should further encourage economists to study this marvelous structure,"" the three write.

42427748,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3ZJh,1505150431,Ethereum's ERC-20 Token Standard Has Been Formalized,"The standard that governs how new cryptographic tokens can be launched on top of the ethereum blockchain has been been finalized.  Revealed today  by the open-source project's developer team, the ERC-20 standard establishes a common set of rules for tokens issued via ethereum smart contracts, and currently serves as the basis for the many tokens that have been released through initial coin offerings (ICOs).  The standard has now been formalized on the ethereum GitHub page, meaning that going forward, all tokens built on ethereum should conform to the standard.  ERC-20 was previously unenforced, but it had been readily adopted by token developers since its introduction in late 2015. The standard ensures that ethereum-based tokens perform in a predictable way throughout the ecosystem, such that decentralized applications and smart contracts are interoperable across the platform, and that all tokens follow a fixed standard of security.  A token is a script running on top of the ethereum blockchain, with an associated database keeping track of ether payments. The term has gained widespread use in ICOs, most of which already use ERC-20 tokens.  The development comes as the roadmap for ethereum's next major upgrade, Metropolis, becomes clearer. Developers revealed last week that a new testnet will be launched a week from now.  Pending the success of that process, ethereum's actual upgrade could come as early as October.

42427747,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3ZDh,1505145909,BTC-e Opens User Support Tool Ahead of Bitcoin Trading Relaunch,"Cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e is beefing up support ahead of a planned trading relaunch this week.  BTC–e, which began allowing account withdrawals earlier this mont after a crackdown by U.S. authorities, announced today that it would begin accepting English and Russian-language support tickets through a new portal.  In that news update, BTC-e outlined that it would only be responding to certain queries (primarily related to withdrawals and deposits made between July 25 and August ) until it launches its new trading platform on September 15.  That the exchange would launch an expanded support functionality is perhaps a relief to some users. Signs on social media indicate some are still experiencing problems with their accounts, including some issues related to two-factor authentication. BTC-e's news update said that it would begin addressing 2FA problems ""after [users pass] the verification on the new platform.""  The move comes just over a month after BTC-e first declared its intention to relaunch, claiming that it had secured just over half of the funds it initially held.  Greek police, acting on a U.S. warrant, arrested one of the exchange's alleged operators in July, a move quickly followed by the seizure of BTC-e's web domain as well as the levying of a $110 million fine by the U.S. government. That alleged administrator, Alexander Vinnik, has meanwhile issued comments to the media declaring that he is innocent.

15989250,http://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/choose-best-bitcoin-exchange,1505145736,How To Choose The Best Bitcoin Exchange,"If you are looking to get started with digital currencies, and in particular Bitcoins, it will pay to look at exchanges. From Gemini to Luno, to Unocoin there are many to choose from, so knowing which one to turn to can be confusing. We have set up a guide for you which is designed to help break down the features that you should be looking for in your chosen exchange. Ultimately, you will be investing your funds into Bitcoin, and the exchange in which you buy them from, so it is important that you are choosing the right one for you. Our checklist has been designed to help you come to the right decision, without forgetting about anything. Although, you should always do your own research first, as exchanges will likely change based on the market itself and the exchange rate. To help get you started, these are just some things you should be considering: Where the exchange is located. It is important to know what country the exchange that you are looking at is based out of, as you may find that laws and regulations can change dramatically from country to country. It is much more advisable to buy your Bitcoin from an exchange that is based in your own country. Whether you choose an exchange that is based in your own country or not, it pays to always read the fine print carefully, as there may be some currencies that are not accepted. This is particularly important if you are looking to trade in multiple currencies. How the Bitcoins can be purchased and any exchange fees. Before you commit to any exchange, it is important to determine how you can pay for your Bitcoins, and whether this is convenient to you. There are a number of possibilities, including wire transfer, cash, credit cards and PayPal just to name a few. It is important to find one that suits you best. Pay close attention to the privacy levels as well, as some forms of payment will be more private than others. Credit cards are likely to be the least private way to purchase Bitcoins, so bear this in mind if you were considering using that as a form of payment. Different exchanges like LocalMonero will also charge different exchange fees, so it is important to look around and find an exchange where the fees are a reasonable amount, and are not overpriced compared to the rest of the market. It is also important to note that the fees can change overtime, and can vary drastically. It is worth checking to see whether your chosen exchange charges additional fees on top of Bitcoin transaction fees. How quickly will you receive your Bitcoins? Something that is very important to research prior to picking your Bitcoin exchange is how quickly you will receive your currency. Although the time frame might not bother you, it is worth knowing, so you can flag up any problems should they arise. Check to see if your exchange offers a ‘locked in’ price. This means that the price in which you buy your Bitcoins at, is the price that you will actually be charged; even if the Bitcoins take a few days to arrive, giving time for the price to change. It is best to find all of this out prior to signing up to an exchange, so you can be prepared. Anonymity? Before committing to any exchange, it is important to decide whether anonymity is important to you or not. Although complete anonymity is very difficult, there are a number of different things that you can check that will help to protect you. Make sure the exchange that you choose follow both the Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws in your own country. Although these will ultimately protect you in the long run, it does mean that some identity information will have to be sent to them before you can purchase any Bitcoins. Preventing and avoiding fraud should be at the front of your mind all the time you are making decisions about the Bitcoin exchange. We will go into more detail on how you can prevent being a victim of fraud later on. How secure is the exchange? If you are only going to research one thing, it should be how secure the exchange is. It is not something that should be overlooked at all. Firstly, check that the web address is secure. If it has HTTP it is not secure. It must have HTTPS. If it is not secure, do not consider it, as it is too much of a risk. Other factors worth checking is if the exchange offers secure log in, as well as a two-step authentication. If you are not happy with the security features of an exchange, do not sign up to the exchange. Trust your instinct, and keep your money safe. Has the exchange got a good reputation? One of the most important things that you can do when it comes to choosing an exchange is to listen to what others are saying about it. Reputation and word of mouth is one of the most reliable pieces of feedback that you can get. If you have not heard much about the exchange that you are looking, visit some internet forums and ask questions and get feedback. It is a great way to get an honest review about what to look for, and might help influence your decision. How to help prevent Bitcoin Exchanges fraud: Unfortunately anything that is done online has an element of risk attached to it, and careful measures must be taken to keep your account safe. There are some basic steps that you can follow that will help to keep you safe online, and often they stretch further than the exchange itself. Never disclose how much your investments are worth Posting how much your investments are worth will instantly prick the ears of any hackers that are out there. Do not feel that you have to disclose anything about your investments, or what you have been able to purchase with them. Never disclose where you trade Much the same advice as above. Disclosing where you trade can be very risky, and you instantly open yourself up to fraud risks. So, the bottom line is, to not discuss where you trade, especially on public social media sites and forums, such as Twitter and Facebook. Use an exchange that offers a Two Factor Authentication Finding an exchange that uses a two-step authentication is a great way to keep your accounts protected. The two-step authentication works in a very simple way, where the user will supply a username and a password, and a third party will provide a temporary security code by text, or app. This makes it very difficult for hackers to enter your account, as they will have to access to your phone; so before you commit to a Bitcoin exchange, check to see if yours is supported by the two-factor authentication. Use more than one exchange Spreading your investments across more than one exchange will help to keep them protected. Doing this will mean that if one account on an exchange got hacked, you would not lose all of your investments. Avoid using real answers in security questions When you set up an account, it is likely that you will be asked a number of different security questions, such as ‘what was your first pets name?’ or ‘What city were you born?’. Good and experienced hackers will know where to look to get this information, and it is not unlikely that you might have leaked at some point online. The easiest way to protect yourself is to use false answers, that only you know the information to. Remember that no amount of security is too much This is one of the most valuable things that you can remember when using an exchange. Research different exchanges well, as it is in your best interest that you protect your assets through as much digital security as you can. Don’t tell anyone your passwords either, and remember to only invest as many Bitcoins as you are willing to lose. Use Multi-Sig exchanges To increase security and reduce your chances of becoming hacked, pick an exchange that offers multi-sig. This means that two signatures are required, but also means that two servers would have to be hacked in order to steal your investment, adding extra security. Even if you follow all of these, it will not eliminate the risk of fraud completely, but rather make it as hard for the hackers as possible. Regardless, it is ultimately your responsibility to research your exchange well, and keep on top of all the security changes and updates.

42400398,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJSEq,1505142033,"Bitcoin Finds Bottom at $4,000 as Price Awaits Post-China Breakout","The bitcoin-US dollar exchange rate (BTC/USD) may have climbed back above $4,000, but it might be ready to push higher even though China uncertainty reigns supreme.  Following reports the country's regulators may be seeking to shut down domestic bitcoin exchanges, the bitcoin price fell to a low of $3,977 on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) this weekend. The rumor comes a week after the People's Bank of China (PBOC) banned initial coin offerings (ICO), suddenly outlawing the practice of creating and selling cryptocurrency to investors to finance startup projects.  The confusion about what might lie ahead cut short bitcoin's ascent on Friday following a repeated technical failure around $4,650 levels, and the subsequent sell-off was exacerbated by the bearish news out of China.  So far, Bloomberg and the Wall street Journal are out with the reports today, suggesting the ban will be limited to exchange-based trading and will not affect over-the-counter transactions.  Further, wires are reporting that the price of bitcoin could drop below $4,000 if China bans trading on continuous order books of the larger exchanges. China's biggest exchanges and traders across the globe are still waiting for official confirmation.  Investors aren't buying it  All in all, it's no wonder the trading is subdued this Monday morning.  However, bitcoin has been successful in defending the psychological support of $4,000 – meaning price action indicates investors do not think China would shut down bitcoin exchanges, or that if they did, it would only have a limited impact.  Furthermore, it appears any ban on exchange-based cryptocurrency trades will not extend to over-the-counter (OTC) transactions, meaning markets could still move.  As per Wall Street Journal, ""A ban on crypto exchanges won't mean the end of trading in digital currencies.""  No news is good news  It's been 72 hours since the news of a China exchange ban broke out, and we are yet to hear official confirmation or denial. The broader market sentiment remains positive, hence, no news (official confirmation or denial) will be taken as good news.  Thus, investors may start snapping up bitcoins at current levels, although in such a case the digital currency would take a big hit if China, following a prolonged silence, suddenly confirms the ban.  Daily chart  Bears may be salivating at the idea of a big sell-off following the breach of the rising trend line, although, what we have now is a symmetrical triangle pattern.  The symmetrical triangle, which can also be referred to as a coil, usually forms during a trend as a continuation pattern. The pattern contains at least two lower highs and two higher lows. Prices typically breakout in the direction of the prior trend, i.e. in BTC's case, an upside breakout will signal resumption of the rally from the June 16 low of $1,826.  One may feel tempted to bet on the direction of the breakout, however, it may be advisable to stay on the sidelines and only trade the breakout.  One reason is that the 5-day moving average and the 10-DMA moving average are now capping the upside in bitcoin. The 14-day RSI is dangerously close to being bearish.  A downside break [an end of the day close below the symmetrical triangle floor] would mean bitcoin has made a near-term top at $5,000. The subsequent move lower could be extended to $3,164 (200-day moving average).  A bullish move is seen gathering pace following a break above $4,500. The level marks the confluence of the rising trend line resistance and symmetrical triangle resistance. Fresh record highs could be seen if prices break above $4,500.

Last week, the European Commission's Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Group detailed the work being done by three startups – Signaturit, Authenteq and The Billon Group – to develop services around digital identity and payments, among other use cases.  Horizon 2020 data indicates that the EU has contributed €5,471,131 in funding to the group of startups. Of those, three startups received more than €1 million apiece, while three others received €50,000 each.  The initiative has become one of the focal points for the bloc's work with blockchain. Last month, the European Commission (the EU's executive arm) said that it was planning to create a ""Blockchains for Social Good"" competition that would operate in conjunction with Horizon 2020. Researchers in Europe have also looked to the program to fund cryptocurrency-related projects.  Earlier this year, the European Commission also began laying the foundation for a so-called Blockchain Observatory that would act as a research and outreach office for its work with the tech.

According to the reports, the ban will be limited to exchange-based trading and will not affect over-the-counter transactions. China's largest bitcoin exchanges, OKCoin, BTCChina and Huobi, told Bloomberg on Monday that they still have yet to be contacted regarding any trading ban.  Notably, Bobby Lee, CEO of China's oldest bitcoin exchange, BTCC, posted a poll on Twitter suggesting that he is not entirely convinced by the news.  The Wall Street Journal reported that they had contacted the People's Bank of China (PBoC) – the country's central bank – for comment, but it had yet to respond.  The reports notably follow a recent ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs) in China, as well as an increase in attention on anti-money laundering policies domestically. For example, the PBoC today put out a notice emphasizing its continued interest in stemming financial crimes and capital flight, two issues long alleged to be connected to its monitoring of cryptocurrency.

42400396,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJSDr,1505127607,MASTer Plan: Better Bitcoin Smart Contracts Could Go Live This Year,"The wait for more advanced bitcoin smart contracts might soon be over.  Spurred by last month's SegWit activation, bitcoin developers are reviving a plan that would see the world's most popular blockchain retooled with functionality long synonymous with ethereum and its more expressive code executions.  Known as Merkelized Abstract Syntax Trees (MAST), the concept has moved in fits and starts – Russell O'Connor, Pieter Wuille and Peter Todd put forward the idea, and Johnson Lau put together his own proposal last year – but the upgrade to SegWit makes the change not only possible, but possibly actionable soon.  So, Blockstream co-founder Mark Friedenbach is now breathing new life into the idea, putting forth a proposal this week that would have MAST deployed by way of soft fork (a backwards-compatible change to the blockchain's rule set).  Should it be enacted (and in the world of bitcoin upgrades, that's a big if), it would mean greater transaction flexibility. With it, users can require that a transaction will go through only if one of two or more things happen. For instance, a transaction could be redeemable only after a certain period of time, or only once two users give their blessing.  MAST also enables better user privacy, as it stores transaction data in a new way and doesn't reveal unused scipts to the public blockchain. And finally, it could also allow for increased scaling potential, since it enables less data to be stored on the blockchain.  Merging features  Getting to those benefits, though, means fusing together two technical features: pay-to-script-hash (P2SH) and Merkle trees.  In an email addressing bitcoin developers, Friedenbach outlines three Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), including the code, for adding two scripts that would make it possible for users to take advantage of MAST.  He explained what his proposed idea would enable, writing:  ""These two features together are enough to enable a range of applications such as tree signatures ... and a generalized MAST useful for constructing private smart contracts.""  The first BIP, ""Fast Merkle Trees,"" proposes a different Merkle tree structure than the one currently used by bitcoin to store transactions in blocks. The second BIP, arguably the most important one, describes the opcode – MERKLE-BRANCH-VERIFY – which is a script that would allow users to make new types of transactions.  ""In brief summary, MERKLE-BRANCH-VERIFY allows script authors to force redemption to use values selected from a pre-determined set committed to in the scriptPubKey, but without requiring revelation of unused elements in the set for both enhanced privacy and smaller script sizes,"" Friedenbach wrote.  The final BIP, ""Tail Call Execution Semantics,"" is a pretty complex read, but – put simply – explains a new way for bitcoin smart contracts to terminate.  The road to upgrades  Despite how complicated the technology sounds, Friedenbach said in practice it's relatively straightforward.  ""I believe that the implementation of these features is simple enough, and the use cases compelling enough that we could [roll out] these features in relatively short order, perhaps before the end of the year,"" he wrote.  Interestingly, though, he mentioned the change could be made one of two ways, by BIP 8 or BIP 9, two methods of making bitcoin upgrades which have had plenty of back-and-forth over the past year.  SegWit was originally proposed to deploy via BIP 9, which called for a certain percentage of miners to signal for the change before it could be deployed. Because miners didn't signal, SegWit stalled, and some argued BIP 9 gave miners (one group in an elaborate ecosystem) too much control over the future of bitcoin.  Because of that, some users have since rallied around BIP 8 as a better upgrading mechanism because it relies on bitcoin users and businesses rather than mining pools to enforce the change.  But Friedenbach's lack of stance regarding this upgrading mechanism raises the question: after all the drama over SegWit – which took nearly two years to activate – how will upgrades be made in the future?  The way users, companies and developers choose to go on MAST (if they decide it's the right step), might help determine that.

Arrested in Greece  in July following an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice, the Russian native is currently being held there on charges of money laundering and operating an ""unlicensed monetary service"" until he can be extradited to the U.S. Vinnik refused to allow himself to be voluntarily extradited.  In the interview with Russia Today, Vinnik said:  ""I do not consider myself guilty … The fact that I worked for BTC-e and did my job, and it's not justifiable to accuse me of it. I found out about the charge about a month after I was taken into custody. This was told to me by my Russian lawyer.""  BTC-e was raided by U.S. officials and shut down on July 25, but has since come back online and pledged to return user funds. In a statement at the time, the group claimed Vinnik was never in charge of the exchange.  Other statements hinted at what could become one of the more notable trials to emerge from the blockchain technology sector.  For example, Vinnik's wife Alexandra told Russia Today that she believes he is being framed by the U.S. because they want to use his ""intellect."" Further, she said it was ""weird"" that Vinnik would be tried in the U.S. given that he did not work or live there.  Vinnik agreed, telling the news source that he does not understand how the U.S. government can judge a Russian citizen.  The statements in this article were translated from Russian.

42400394,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJSAu,1505120430,Microsoft Plays Blockchain Matchmaker with Azure Council Creation,"Microsoft is stepping into a new role as matchmaker in its creation of the Microsoft Azure Blockchain Council.  Confirmed in new statements to CoinDesk, the council has been established to better connect those looking for distributed ledger tools with the kinds of companies that can build those tools.  Spurred by requests for proposals sent to Microsoft for blockchain services, the software giant now wants to allow its sector-specific partners to bid on those requests. In this way, Microsoft is seeking to provide startups with access to revenue opportunities, while helping to build blockchain solutions for existing clients.  While the council seems a bit like a new consortium effort, the spokesperson said it is actually more than that:  ""It's almost like a sales tool for the partners.""  In addition to competing for the requests for proposals, council members are also expected to develop proofs-of-concept that will receive support from Microsoft's blockchain engineering team.  As an increasing number of blockchain applications are being trusted with live transactions, the establishment of the council positions Microsoft's Azure cloud computing services as a way for companies to evolve past the ideation phase with emerging blockchain technology.  Who exactly is part of this effort, however, remains largely unclear.  Synechron, a financial services consulting firm that announced a blockchain accelerator programhttps://www.synechron.com/media/synechron-unveils-blockchain-accelerator-program-cloud last year, revealed itself as the first member of the council yesterday. Otherwise, Microsoft is being cautious about revealing any additional members.  ""We're going to allow the additional partners to announce their membership when they're ready, and we do expect more members to join,"" a spokesperson said.

42400380,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJRx8,1505119227,"Fully Invested, Always Long? Big Money Might Be Changing the Crypto Market","As institutional investors pile into the cryptocurrency space, they may be altering the underlying dynamics of the market itself.  By virtue of buying in, institutional investors are pushing prices up, and that's likely to continue as these investors place bets in a way that furthers an already bullish cycle many have labeled a bubble.  Bearing mountains of cash and a mindset unlike retail investors, crypto hedge funds are being directed to invest all (or most) of their cash. And without sophisticated mechanisms for shorting cryptocurrencies, retail investors have limited options and excessive risk in betting on price decreases.  Matthew Goetz, co-founder of new cryptocurrency fund BlockTower Capital, affirmed the impact of this buying pressure is likely to continue to mean the cryptocurrency market doesn't behave like those of more mature assets.  Goetz told CoinDesk:  ""As more capital comes in the space, from a market structure standpoint, whether it's funds or some other structure, that will likely be a bullish catalyst for prices.""  And Goetz, who worked for more than a decade at Goldman Sachs, has no doubt that more capital will come.  ""I think the space is going to continue to get more competitive, because people are seeing the opportunity set,"" he said.  The bullish comments were echoed by Thomas Kineshanko, co-founder of Protos Cryptocurrency Asset Management, who believes the mechanisms at play are working to push cryptocurrency prices skyward even more.  ""Given the total market cap of cryptocurrency of say $150 billion on any given day, and then you add say a billion dollars, prices are going to rise. So yes, the money coming in to the market is going to raise prices – as long as there's not any major sell-off,"" Kineshanko told CoinDesk.  Short trading challenges  But institutional investors aren't betting on major sell-offs, primarily because shorting is still an underdeveloped mechanism in the cryptocurrency market.  ""The only thing you can't do right now very efficiently [in cryptocurrency] is short assets,"" said Philipp Kallerhoff, who runs trading at Protos.  He went on to draw a direct line between these difficulties and the upward pressure on their prices, stating:  ""There's momentum and pressure on the long side.""  BlockTower's Goetz expressed similar concerns, saying that while shorting cryptocurrency is possible, it's very risky so it must be approached ""very selectively and very cautiously.""  Diving further into the claim, when investors short an asset, they're expecting to buy at a lower price in the future, but this means investors are exposed to a theoretically unlimited downside risk, since increases to the price could be boundless.  This is far different from going long, since an asset's price can only drop so much – to zero – from the price it's currently at.  With that, in today's markets it would take a great deal of nerve to short cryptocurrency.  Fully invested – or not?  Not only will institutional investors be unlikely to short cryptocurrencies, but the primary driver of staying fully invested is also pushing prices higher.  ""People don't want to pay you for holding cash,"" Protos' Kallerhoff said.  In traditional markets, hedging mechanisms – like highly liquid derivatives markets – are used to manage the risk of being fully invested. In the cryptocurrency space, investing fully in the markets would add additional upward pressure on prices.  Because cryptocurrency markets don't have many of the hedging mechanisms, cash takes on that role in risk mitigation.  ""I can't speak for other managers,"" Goetz told CoinDesk, ""but this asset class is so volatile, that in order to invest you need to invest [in] holding some amount of cash. Cash is the main risk management tool available in this space.""  Timothy Enneking, managing director at Crypto Asset Management, echoed Goetz's caution:  ""When we don't have a good feel for the direction the market is going to take in a given strategy, we usually pull a large percentage of the positions out of crypto and into fiat. Safer to wait for a sense of what's going to happen there than in crypto.""  The result is that, while not quite the Wild West, the crypto asset class still has a long way to go before it behaves in a way familiar to the mainstream.

Siluanov offered insight into the government's plans to oversee Russia's domestic cryptocurrency market during an appearance at the Moscow Financial Forum last Friday. Echoing previous statements by members of the Russian government, Siluanov said banning cryptocurrencies does not make sense and that the ministry will likely treat digital monies similarly to securities, Reuters reports.  According to Wordnews  , Siluanov said:  ""The state certainly understands that cryptocurrencies are a reality, there is no point in prohibiting them. It is possible to regulate them, so the Finance Ministry will draw up a bill by the end of the year.""  His comments add to those coming from other quarters of the Russian government, offering yet another window into what could be a completed policy move by the end of the year  Earlier this month, State Duma financial markets committee head Anatoly Aksakov said he would be forming a working group to determine how best to create legislation regulating cryptocurrencies. He, too, indicated a bill will be passed before the end of the year.  Russia's central bank also declared it was working on a regulation for digital currencies earlier this year.  While the government would be regulating them, cryptocurrencies are still risky, Siluanov said. There is an immense potential for fraud due to the nature of trading cryptocurrencies. He referred to the technology as being insecure.  Minister of Economic Development Maxim Oreshkin agreed, calling cryptocurrencies ""volatile"" and saying financial institutions may find it difficult to conduct transactions with them. Digital currencies' ability to jump or drop in value quickly in particular is of concern.  According to Lenta.ru  , he told a Russian news network that:  ""We see that the volatility that exists here is tens of percent in one direction, tens of percent in the other direction, which in fact is bad about this instrument.""  Regulating the market would prevent those rapid shifts, ensuring more security for those who trade in these currencies, he said.  Some statements in this article have been translated from Russian.
