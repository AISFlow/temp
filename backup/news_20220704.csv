The &apos;spent output profit ratio&apos; (or SOPR in short) is an indicator that tells us whether Bitcoin investors are currently selling at a profit or at a loss.

Lawmakers from the Green Party and Socialist representatives also appear to favor including self-managed crypto wallets and decentralized finance under a proposed regulation on money laundering.  Last week, the bloc provisionally agreed on new laws known as the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA) that would license crypto companies and impose identity checks on transactions. But the European Commission was keen to leave detailed money-laundering procedures for a wider overhaul that also covers sectors such as banking.  Read more: EU Agrees on Landmark Crypto Authorization Law, MiCA  An amendment to those laundering laws proposed by the Green Party’s Ernest Urtasun and Kira Marie Peter-Hansen, alongside Socialists Aurore Lalucq and Csaba Molnár, seeks to make NFT platforms – anyone who acts as an intermediary for importing, minting or trading the assets that represent proof of ownership of artworks or collectibles – “obliged entities” under EU money-laundering law, according to the document dated June 22.  That would mean that the likes of NFT marketplace OpenSea might have to assess the risk of illicit finance flowing through their systems and carry out identity checks on new customers and suspicious transactions, on par with what other entities like banks, real estate agents, art traders and other crypto providers do.  Read more: No AML Checks for Most Transfers to Unhosted Crypto Wallets, EU Policymakers Decide  Further amendments by Urtasun, Peter-Hansen, Lalucq and Dutch lawmaker Paul Tang seek to use the law to impose laundering checks on decentralized autonomous organizations and “unhosted wallets” that aren’t managed by any regulated crypto provider. An attempt to do so via MiCA and a parallel set of rules known as the Transfer of Funds regulation was largely abandoned following opposition from EU member governments.  Another change, which was proposed by Gunnar Beck of the right-wing Alternative for Germany party, seeks to protect cryptocurrencies from the effects of the law, saying cryptos “make it possible for people to diversify their portfolio and protect themselves from risks of [European Central Bank]-induced euro inflation.""

Tharman Shanmugaratnam, minister in charge of MAS, said in Parliament on Monday that the central bank may ""place limits on retail participation"" and introduce rules on the use of leverage in crypto transactions.  Shanmugaratnam had been asked by member of parliament Murali Pillai whether the MAS intended to implement further restrictions on crypto trading platforms.  ""Since 2017, MAS has consistently warned that cryptocurrencies are not suitable investments for the retail public,"" Shanmugaratnam said. ""Most cryptocurrencies are subject to sharp speculative price swings. Recent events have vividly demonstrated the risks, with prices of several cryptocurrencies falling drastically.""  In January, MAS introduced guidelines limiting how crypto firms could advertise to the public, preventing them from marketing their services in public areas or media that address the public, such as newspapers, broadcast, magazines or social media platforms.  Last month, Sopnendu Mohanty, the central bank's chief fintech officer, said MAS plans to be ""brutal and relentingly hard"" on ""bad behavior"" in the crypto industry. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mohanty said Singapore had enforced a ""painfully slow ... extremely draconian due diligence process"" for licensing crypto firms in order to protect the wider economy.

42374406,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZNKh,1656946263,First Mover Americas: BTC Struggles to Break $20K as More Lenders Face Trouble,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. I’m Lyllah Ledesma, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights.  Price Point: BTC remains below $20,000 and Argentinians are buying stablecoins more than normal as their economy minister resigned over the weekend.  Market Moves: Solana DeFi protocol Crema lost $8.8 million in an exploit on Sunday.  Price point  Bitcoin (BTC) was up 2% on the day with U.S. equity index futures and European bonds falling as investors worried about the threats of deteriorating economic growth and inflation.  Germany also reported its first monthly trade deficit in three decades as surging import prices have caused a shortfall in the export-reliant nation, according to Bloomberg.  Bitcoin is down 6% over the last seven days to about $19,400., and ether (ETH) is also down over the last seven days with a decline of about 10%. ETH’s price weakness continues as ""the Merge"" fast approaches. The Merge will see the network go to a proof-of-stake platform from proof-of-work.  Crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital filed for bankruptcy late Friday after weeks of speculation that it was functionally insolvent.  Celsius Network, an American-Israeli crypto lender, laid off 150 employees over the weekend as it battles a crisis that prompted it to halt customer withdrawals last month.  Crypto exchange Coinbase said in a report that recent selling of newly minted bitcoin by crypto miners doesn't add any significant market pressure. If all newly issued bitcoin were sold onto the market each day, it would equate to only 900 BTC of selling pressure, Coinbase said.  In South America, Martin Guzman, Argentina’s economy minister, resigned on Saturday. That caused citizens to purchase up to three times as many stablecoins over the weekend than they usually do, crypto companies in the country told CoinDesk.  Separately, a survey from Mastercard reported that over 51% of Latin Americans made at least one transaction with cryptocurrencies between March and April.  Market moves  By Shaurya Malwa  Solana-based liquidity protocol Crema Finance had more than $8.8 million worth of cryptocurrencies stolen from its platform in an attack over the weekend, developers said in a tweet.  Crema said it had suspended its smart contract after the exploit. The protocol allows liquidity providers to set specific price ranges, add single-sided liquidity and conduct range order trading. This makes for a sophisticated and decentralized trading platform.  “We've been closely working with several experienced security institutes and relevant organizations to track the hacker's fund movements,” the developers said in a tweet.  Value locked on Crema plunged to $3 million on Monday from over $12 million on Saturday following the exploit, data shows. Crema has seen trading volume of $1.34 billion since its inception in January.  The attacker started by creating a fake ""tick"" account. A tick account is ""a dedicated account that stores price tick data in CLMM,” the developers said, referring to Crema's market making protocol. After that, the attacker exploited a command by writing the data on the fake account and circumventing security measures.

Ether (ETH) rose 5% in the past 24 hours to trade above $1,100. Solana’s SOL and Cardano’s ADA each added about 4%, while XRP and BNB gained over 3.5%. Total crypto market capitalization increased 2.3%, CoinGecko data showed.  Among smaller tokens, Avalanche’s AVAX and Tron’s TRX gained over 8%, while gains among other cryptocurrencies ranged from 2% to 5%. Thorchain’s RUNE added as much as 15%, continuing a run since last month’s mainnet launch.  Equity traders remain concerned about the slowing pace of growth, which could dent chances of longer recovery. Japanese financial services giant Nomura said in a Monday note that major economies could enter recession “in the next 12 months” amid tightening monetary policies and higher costs.  “Increasing signs that the world economy is entering a synchronized growth slowdown, meaning countries can no longer rely on a rebound in exports for growth, have also prompted us to forecast multiple recessions,” Nomura analysts wrote.  The analysts said they expect Europe, the U.K., Japan, South Korea, Australia, U.S. and Canada to fall into recession. They said the U.S. could experience a “shallow but long” recession of five quarters and Europe could take a much deeper hit because of Russia's attack on Ukraine.  Last week, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated the U.S. central bank's commitment to increasing interest rates to curtail inflation, as reported. Powell said he was more concerned about the challenge posed by inflation than about the possibility of higher interest rates pushing the U.S. economy into a recession.  The Fed’s outlook and declining equity markets have weighed on crypto prices this year, alongside systemic risks from within the market. Bitcoin has lost 57% since the start of the year, and the S&P500 has lost nearly 20% during the same period.  “Overall caution is still the name of the game,” Susannah Streeter, a markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, told CoinDesk in an email. “Investors nurse wounds from a bruising first half of the year.”",NEUTRAL,ADA,ADA | ASIA | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/04/bitcoin-recovers-to-over-19k-nomura-warns-of-us-uk-recession,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d74cd302118a3dbb4273980622d850bc6d49003c-1765x1324.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Key technical points: The TRX prices attempt to cross above the 200-day EMA. The price action shows a high likelihood of a breakout rally reaching the $0.075 mark. The 24-hour trading volume of Tron is $614 Million, indicating a rise of 34%. Past Performance of TRX The TRX price action shows that increased supply inflow in June dropped the market price to the $0.055 mark. However, the sharp V-shaped reversal has kept prices above the psychological level of $0.050, leading to a sideways trend above $0.063. The sideways trend shows a possible double bottom pattern formation with the 200-day SMA acting as a dynamic neckline.

But, the prices decline today, leading to a reversal from the 200-day SMA, reflecting an increase in supply. The MACD indicator shows a bullish trend approaching the zero line, which increases the chances of the lines crossing into the positive territory. Moreover, the RSI indicator shows a gradual increase in the underlying bullishness as the RSI slope sustains above the 14-day SMA but struggles to surpass the halfway line.

Paris-based Napoleon Asset Management is licensed by French regulator Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) under the Alternative Investment Fund Manager (AIFM) directive, which gives ""passporting"" permission to market products and services across the EU.  An AIFM license doesn't include authorization of the funds themselves – only passporting for the funds to be marketed across borders within the EU.  Jersey-based CoinShares agreed to purchase the broader Napoleon Group late last year for 13.9 million euros ($14.5 million) in cash and stock. The acquisition of Napoleon Asset Management, however, was subject to approval by the AMF, which was granted on June 28.  CoinShares, which claims to be Europe's largest digital asset firm, can now offer its exchange-traded products and other investment vehicles across the EU, giving it a much-needed source of extra revenue.  In May, CoinShares reported that its first-quarter income fall by 45%, compared with a year earlier, a trend that may get worse given the sharp downturn in the crypto markets over the last month.

Some 58% of its loan book consists of loans to 3AC: And its loan book is nearly 50% of total assets: So approximately 28% of Voyager&apos;s assets are in default. And since 3AC now has creditor protection, Voyager must wait for bankruptcy courts to decide how much, if anything, can be recovered. That will take months.But the balance sheet hole doesn&apos;t explain why Voyager has suspended US dollar withdrawals. Despite its apparently healthy &apos;cash held for customers&apos; balance, it seems to be dreadfully short of cash. There is something else going on here.As always when something doesn&apos;t quite add up, I take a look at the books. In May, only a few days after Terra&apos;s collapse, Voyager released its quarterly financial update, dated 31st March. The income statement makes grim reading: Voyager is making whopping losses.

In times of market upheaval and a falling bitcoin price, margins compress across the board and force more miners to become net sellers, the note said. Given the price drop and the resulting loss of profitability, the financing environment for the mining industry has “shifted materially” since late last year, and raising capital in the public markets has become very difficult, Coinbase said.  Still, even if all newly issued bitcoin were immediately sold onto the market each day, that would equate to only 900 BTC of selling pressure, which represents just 1%-1.5% of total daily volume, it added. A healthier bitcoin derivatives market should allow miners more options in terms of potential hedging strategies, the report added.  Read more: Crypto Miners Face Margin Calls, Defaults as Debt Comes Due in Bear Market  Mining companies that expanded aggressively in recent years and leveraged their balance sheet in the process are now being forced to restructure their operations, the note said. These conditions “should present opportunities for consolidation across the mining industry in the second half of the year as less prudent miners continue to face challenges.”  While the mining market may still be far from an equilibrium hashrate, miner selling and shuttering of activities in recent months has resulted in a falling network hashrate and ultimately mining difficulty, and once these trends flatten it could signal the start of a bottoming process, based on similar trends observed in the 2018 crypto winter, the report said.

The shares rose over 9% at the open.  The deal was approved by Competition Bureau Canada, Ontario Securities Commission and other provincial regulatory boards, according to WonderFi.  In addition, WonderFi said it might purchase other crypto companies as the shakeout in the sector continues. CEO Ben Samaroo told CoinDesk he thinks other nonregulated crypto trading platforms might have similar issues as Voyager Digital, which had exposure to troubled hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and has had to limit withdrawals. As a result, WonderFi has begun looking at potential deals for nonregulated exchanges both in Canada and globally.  ""This acquisition further solidifies WonderFi as a leader amongst crypto companies in Canada, and along with our acquisition of Bitbuy, establishes a great foundation for our expansion into global markets,"" Samaroo said in a statement Monday ahead of the market open. ""Further, as we've seen over the past few weeks, the crypto market downturn has had a massive impact on the viability of unregulated crypto trading platforms and WonderFi's value proposition as one of the few regulated crypto businesses makes us well positioned to continue our growth.""  The purchase follows a 20% staff reduction at both WonderFi and Bitbuy, a crypto trading platform WonderFi acquired in January. The job cuts were made to streamline costs and deliver shared services across compliance, customer service, product engineering and executive functions.  WonderFi houses central finance, decentralized finance (DeFi) and play-to-earn gaming and non-fungible tokens (GameFi) businesses under one umbrella.

42374401,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZNFf,1656922992,Solana DeFi Protocol Crema Loses $8.8M in Exploit,"Solana-based liquidity protocol Crema Finance had more than $8.78 million worth of cryptocurrencies stolen from its platform in an attack over the weekend, developers said in a tweet.  Crema said it had suspended its smart contract after the exploit. The protocol allows liquidity providers to set specific price ranges, add single-sided liquidity and conduct range order trading. This makes for a sophisticated and decentralized trading platform.  “We've been closely working with several experienced security institutes and relevant organizations to track the hacker's fund movements,” the developers said in a tweet.  Value locked on Crema plunged to $3 million on Monday from over $12 million on Saturday following the exploit, data shows. Crema has seen trading volumes of $1.34 billion since its inception in January.  The attacker started by creating a fake tick account. A tick account is ""a dedicated account that stores price tick data in CLMM,” the developers said, referring to Crema's market making protocol. After that, the attacker exploited a command by writing the data on the fake account and circumventing security measures.  The attacker then used a flash loan to manipulate the prices of assets on liquidity pools. This, along with the false data entries, allowed the attacker to claim “a huge fee amount out from the pool.”  Flash loans allow traders to borrow unsecured loans from lenders by relying on smart contracts instead of third parties.  The stolen funds were swapped to 69422.9 solana (SOL) and 6,497,738 USD coin (USDC). The Solana-based USDC was then bridged to the Ethereum network via Wormhole and swapped to 6,064 ether (ETH). These funds amount to over $8.5 million at current prices.  The attacker’s Ethereum address, 0x8021b2962dB803b73Aa874030B0B42c202E8458F as flagged by blockchain scanning tool Etherscan, had not moved the stolen funds or converted to other coins at writing time, the data show.",NEGATIVE,ETH | SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SOL | TRADING | ZRX,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/07/04/solana-defi-protocol-crema-loses-88m-in-exploit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b5b8c59bab3bd6d2b8d153fc6f5b9480bff4d923-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Undoubtedly, millions of users are eager to understand and invest in this vast industry. The massive attention is, however, attracting multiple regulatory interventions which compel the use of KYC procedures. Without a clear framework, such policies end up affecting the digital asset economy. The following article, therefore, hopes to give an insight into how KYC may limit cryptocurrency mass adoption. What is KYC? Know Your Customer, commonly known as KYC, refers to processes that analyze a user&apos;s identity. This procedure allows financial institutions and digital asset platforms to examine a customer&apos;s background as they extend their services. Generally, users have to submit their personal data to access a crypto platform&apos;s services. KYC serves as a safety mechanism that eliminates bad actors from committing any financial crime. Such crimes may include activities like money laundering, illegal trafficking, terrorist financing, and many more. How KYC Limits Cryptocurrency Mass Adoption KYC may affect the acceptance rate of digital currencies in the following ways: 1. Impersonation A number of crypto-based projects may ask for private user-data to access their products. Once this information falls into the wrong hands, cases of impersonation may begin to spread.

Three major crypto exchanges said consumers were looking to hedge against a potential devaluation of the Argentine peso (ARS), whose buying power has plummeted over the past year as inflation skyrockets.  Following Guzman’s resignation, the peso depreciated about 15% against the stablecoins DAI and tether (USDT) on several leading local exchanges' platforms. Both stablecoins rose from ARS 245 on Friday to ARS 280 over the weekend. (Following the appointment of Silvina Batakis to replace Guzman as the new minister of economy late Sunday, tether quotations on Argentine exchanges rose to ARS 303 per coin.)  “Whenever there is one of these news stories in Argentina, because of the 24/7 nature of crypto, it is the first market where Argentina starts to look for a price for the U.S. dollar. This drives volumes up,” Sebastian Serrano, CEO of the Argentina-based crypto exchange Ripio, told CoinDesk.  Guzmán’s resignation is part of the latest fallout from a fight between Argentine President Alberto Fernandez and Vice President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner over the economic direction of the country, where inflation spiked 60% in May compared with the same month last year.  In addition, Argentina's central bank is running out of foreign currency reserves, which is hindering imports, among other consequences.  Read more: Why Argentines Are Turning From Dollars to Stablecoins Like DAI  Argentine exchange Buenbit recorded a 300% increase in trading on Sunday compared with the same day in previous weeks, the company told CoinDesk. It said “many people” used their DAI as collateral to obtain loans in Argentine pesos and purchase more DAI as protection against a potential peso devaluation.  Various local media reports did not rule out the possibility that the government might announce a foreign exchange holiday on Monday to calm markets.  Due to the lack of price references for the U.S. dollar over the weekend, most Argentine exchanges increased the spreads between bid and ask prices to 18%, when in general they are around 2%.  Pablo Sabbatella, founder of the crypto education platform DefyEducation, which focuses on Latin America, tweeted on Sunday, “Exchanges added a giant spread so that people don't trade and they [the exchanges] hedge against tomorrow's opening price.”  “Due to demand and without a reference replacement price, prices rose and spreads widened,” tweeted Andrés Vilella Weisz, head of trading and strategy at the Argentina-based crypto exchange Lemon Cash, adding that after Guzman's resignation the demand for crypto dollars was strong.
