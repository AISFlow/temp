42397419,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb9LvR,1395438876,"US Class Action Lawyer: Mt. Gox Wallet Discovery ""Highly Suspect""","Bankrupt Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox released a new press statement earlier today (21st March) confirming 20th March reports that it had uncovered an 'old-format' bitcoin wallet containing some 200,000 bitcoins ($115.8m at press time) presumed lost in the run-up to its insolvency.  The statement indicated that the company discovered the funds on 7th March and promptly informed the necessary authorities of the recovery.  However, Chris Dore, a partner at Edelson law firm, isn't exactly buying Mt. Gox's version of the events.  Dore, whose firm represents the US class action against the insolvent exchange, suggested that the announcement is closely tied to matters it is currently investigating.  Dore summed up his opinion on the news, telling CoinDesk:  ""Their statement that they found [these bitcoins] in a random wallet and failed to tell anyone for two weeks is highly suspect.""  Instead, Dore indicated he believes that the funds may be connected to his firm's ongoing investigation of 180,000 bitcoins that were said to have been moving through the blockchain on or around 7th March.  ""We believe we were on the right trail. It appeared that these 180,000, 200,000 bitcoins were being tumbled, that they were being broken down and reconstituted, so our goal was to find this out.""  Dore suggested that the announcement may have been a move by Mt. Gox to make it harder for information to be uncovered about the funds.  Added Dore: ""If it's a coincidence, it's a $120m coincidence. We frankly just don't buy it.""  Investigating the funds  In an interview, Dore elaborated on court proceedings held yesterday, noting that during the day's events his legal team had asked for restrictions on Mt. Gox's assets to be relaxed, a request the judge approved. Dore said that his team asked for certain third parties to be able to move the funds.  Explained Dore:  ""We're not fully disclosing what we know or why we were asking that, but essentially it was an effort to try and trace bitcoins that were being moved around and that we believe were associated with this initial group of 180,000 [bitcoins].""  The correlation between the events, Dore suggested, raises questions about Mt. Gox and its conduct.  ""The idea that they found it in a wallet and they were breaking it down into hundreds of thousands of smaller wallets, it raises a lot of questions about their honesty and whether they're being forthright about what they have.""  Dore was not able to fully elaborate on his suspicions regarding the movement of the funds.  Said Dore: ""Our hope was, if they could continue to move, we could track where they would end up.""  What the finding means  Dore also addressed another lingering question, just what exactly does the discovery of the funds mean for former exchange users given that these parties are not creditors.  However, that may be up for dispute. Dore indicated that his firm could still make the case that his clients should be treated with this legal distinction.  ""In our view, any assets are impactful on our settlement, because [these are] the assets, the fiat currency [and] the bitcoins of our class members. We will do everything in our power to get those returns.""  The next scheduled hearing is expected to take place on 1st April. Then, Mt. Gox will attempt to shield its US assets until the conclusion of its bankruptcy proceedings in Japan.

42397413,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb9LrV,1395436532,Report Claims Colombia's Central Bank May Enact Bitcoin Ban,"The Superintendencia Financiera de Colombia (SFC) may be close to outlawing bitcoin transactions in the South American country, a report from a major nationally distributed newspaper claims.  El Tiempo reported on 20th March that the SFC, in conjunction with Banco central de Colombia, Colombia's central bank, and the Ministerio de Hacienda y Crédito Público, the executive body responsible for budgetary concerns, is preparing to issue a document outlining the government's stance on bitcoin and bitcoin-related activities.  According to El Tiempo, the SFC is set release the circular outlining the ban as soon as Tuesday of next week  The Colombian government is expected to cite a lack of effective market protections as one of the core reasons for the measures when it publishes the document, the report suggests. Additionally, the media outlet alleges that bitcoin is viewed by the Colombian government as a threat to the country's financial system.  However, there remains disagreement among South American bitcoin community members as to whether the restrictions will go as far as the report suggests, with some optimistic that the measure will simply amount to a stern warning.  Government opposition to digital currencies  An informal translation of the report  indicates that senior Colombian officials such as Finance Minister Mauricio Cardenas have been working in recent weeks and months on an overarching policy for bitcoin. Research from the US Law Library of Congress, corroborated by BitLegal, indicates this would be the first time the country has spoken publicly about digital currencies.  El Tiempo quoted Cardenas during a recent speech before the country's national legislature in which he touted the strengths of the Colombian peso compared to digital currencies.  ""Our currency is reliable, safe and generates no risk, while other forms of money [like Bitcoin] do not have the same level of support and guarantees,"" he remarked.  A source connected to the Colombian Ministry of Finance told El Tiempo that the ban may very well focus on Bitcoin handling activities rather than outright purchase by consumers.  ""With bitcoin no illegal recruitment, because ultimately what you are doing is buying a product. But when others are offered to collect money from others to invest in that currency, there is already an illegal recruitment, and this brings many risks.""  Colombia's central bank has also reportedly weighed against bitcoin, saying that it is not a real currency and therefore receives no institutional backing.  The Colombian Ministry of Finance nor the Superintendency of Finance have responded to press inquiries.  Community reaction  Sebastian Serrano, CEO of Latin American-focused payment gateway BitPagos, suggested that the initial reports may not be as ominous as they sound.  Speaking to CoinDesk, he said:  ""What we know so far is that the government is going to issue a warning similar to the one issued by the Central Bank of China. Most likely not making bitcoin illegal but just restricting financial institutions from trading Bitcoin in attempt to stop speculation over the currency and avoid the effects of a crash.""  Serrano added that while the news certainly isn't encouraging for the local Colombian ecosystem, the extent of any damage won't be known until the report is released on Tuesday.  Ulf Kuhn, founder of Chile-based telemarketing business Telemarketing Facil, indicated that he was unsure of what exactly to make of the report.  ""First they say bitcoin and EVERY transaction is illegal. Then they say that offering investing services for bitcoins is illegal. Then they say they worked together with banks, but it's just a financial department statement.""  Carlos Mesa, of local bitcoin advocacy group Bitcoin Colombia, took to reddit to discuss the news, suggesting more details would be forthcoming after he had an internal meeting with the SFC.  More central banks weigh in worldwide  While the Colombian government has not released its official document outlining the details of a ban, such a move would add to a growing chorus of governments and central banks worldwide that have moved against the Bitcoin.  Earlier this month, the Bank of Mexico banned domestic banks from handling bitcoin. The Mexican central bank cited its risks to the general public but did not directly outlaw consumer purchases of the cryptocurrency.  Other central banks, including those from Russia, Hungary, Cyprus and the Philippines, have issued warnings about bitcoin but have not moved to ban it, despite sometimes harsh rhetoric.  If as extensive as the report suggests, Colombia's policies would be among the most restrictive enacted worldwide.

42397427,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb9LzN,1395434404,Apple Approves bitWallet iOS App With BTC Sending Function Blocked,"Apple has approved a bitcoin wallet app for the iPhone and iPad, though not without a key restriction: App users will not be able to send BTC.  bitWallet  , made by a company called Sollico, is now available in the Apple App Store. The listing is notable given the struggles of high-profile bitcoin wallet providers such as Coinbase and Blockchain to have their apps remain in the store. Both companies saw their apps removed in events that outraged the wider bitcoin community.  A company representative from Sollico says it submitted the wallet to Apple under the notion that it might be approved if sending capabilities were prohibited:  ""We assumed Apple’s objection is primarily sending bitcoins directly from the app, so we decided to submit the full-featured wallet app, but disable sending bitcoins.""  The prescence of bitWallet's app suggests that Apple may be willing to allow bitcoin apps that cannot send or receive bitcoins directly. The app focuses on mobile security as well as privacy protection for bitcoin storage.  As it stands, bitWallet is a lone App Store option available on iOS for wallets.  bitWallet Features  Although the lack of a send function is an inconvenience, users can transfer funds via other methods with a wallet's private key.  According the Sollico:  ""As long as you have the private key, you can use any client to send your bitcoins - using Blockchain.info is easiest.""  BitWallet goes to lengths to ensure bitcoin wallet privacy on the iPhone. The app guards against the threat of memory scraping by clearing all sensitive information when the app is running in the background. Private keys remain encrypted.  bitWallet's Watchlist feature allows users to track blockchain address transactions. The wallet uses Blockchain.info to retrieve data, and the company says it plans to bring on other sources of ledger information in the future for redundancy purposes.  Another company called Pheeva is planning to distribute a fully functional as a workaround to Apple's bitcoin ban. A members-only private distribution method, cooperatives are commonly used in organizations to distribute internal company-only iOS app.  The bitWallet developers say that the approval process took Apple about three weeks, which is longer than usual.  Apple's stance on bitcoin  Apple has taken a harsh stance against bitcoin apps since last December. That's when when the company required messaging app Gliph to remove its bitcoin ""attachment"" sending feature. The Cupertino company most recently asked e-commerce app Fancy to remove bitcoin payments from its iOS app.  Popular wallet Coinbase had its iOS app pulled last November.  Likewise, in February, Apple removed the Blockchain.info iOS wallet from the App Store. This caused consternation among some users, with one particularly angry Blockchain.info mobile wallet user shooting his iPhone, destroying it.  Despite Apple's behavior towards bitcoin, bitWallet's developers remain optimistic. They say that the plan is to submit another version of the app with sending functionality soon.  Sollico says that it plans to be very clear about the functions of its wallet when it submits future versions of bitWallet to Apple.  ""Once again, we will be totally upfront with Apple about what the app can and cannot do,"" the company added.  It remains unclear when or if Apple will ever allow bitcoin transfers to flow freely from within iOS apps.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/21/apple-approves-bitwallet-ios-app-with-btc-sending-function-blocked,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a9aedfe4bea66e65f92b9e24559e017c27789310-2341x1273.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397416,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb9LqW,1395431538,DirectPool Aims To Prevent 51% Attack with Community-First Mining Pool Approach,"There's no shortage of mining pools in the digital currency community, but a new mining pool named DirectPool has just launched with a notable mission to give back to the bitcoin community and redistribute the network's computing power.  DirectPool bills itself as being a ""next-generation mining pool"", with its focus on preventing any one existing pool from gaining more than 50% of the network's hashing power. DirectPool hopes to work with miners and industry leaders alike to actively contribute to the stable growth of the bitcoin community.  Josh Harris, DirectPool's Media Director, spoke with CoinDesk about the motivations for starting DirectPool, and explained that the idea was conceived as a response to mining pools like Ghash.io, which recently gained nearly 50% of the network's hashpower:    ""When we saw pools getting closer to 51% of the network power, we were really surprised to see the community reaction, and how miners voluntarily distributed themselves to other pools.      The problem was, there weren't many reliable and efficient alternatives to the larger mining pools.""    Harris explained that DirectPool's team of developers have been working diligently to program a stable and user-friendly mining pool that is open to the public, and following its launch earlier this week, registration is now enabled on DirectPool's website.  A ""community mining pool""  DirectPool is working closely with industry organizations like the Bitcoin Business Alliancehttp://bitcoinbusinessalliance.com/home.html (BBA) to actively engage with the entire bitcoin community, and the mining pool plans to help fund bitcoin startups and offer donations to charities through the generosity of its miners.  Said Harris:  ""We haven't seen any other mining pool that is dedicated to helping the bitcoin community. We will be pooling donations from our miners to donate to charities and help offer funds to startups in the crypto community through our partnership with the BBA.""  In addition to engaging with the entire digital currency community, Harris explained that DirectPool also wants its miners to interact with each other and ultimately help decide which charities receive donations or which startups get funded from the community donations.  Preventing a 51% attack  DirectPool was initially founded with the hope to further redistribute the relative network hashing power that is shared amongst the large mining pools like Ghash.io and BTC Guild, Harris said. A ""51% attack"" could theoretically allow an entity that gained more than 50% of bitcoin's total network hashpower to double-spend bitcoins, reverse transactions and prevent block confirmations.  Harris told CoinDesk that while nobody knows for certain what the implications of a 51% attack would be, DirectPool hopes to prevent the situation from ever unfolding:    ""We haven't seen what could really happen if one pool amassed more than 50% of the computing power. Although it's hypothetical, it's unsettling to think what would happen if one of the major pools somehow went down, and where all of its miners would move to.      We wanted to create a mining pool that matches the services of the larger pools while helping to distribute the hashing power even more.""    A warm response  In the few days that DirectPool has been open to the public, Harris says that a respectable amount of miners have already registered, and that there have already been donations coming in from generous miners.  DirectPool plans to offer Litecoin mining in the next couple of weeks, and is currently set up for merge mining of Namecoin so that miners have options when receiving their rewards.

42374530,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvlGrZ,1395424983,Financial Faux Pas Highlight the Need for Decentralised Currencies,"The failure of Mt. Gox attracted a lot of media attention on the world of digital currencies; it quickly became the most popular argument used and abused by bitcoin detractors. Though much of the criticism wasn't misplaced, the ""we told you so"" gloating was.  First of all, Mt. Gox is not and was not the future of bitcoin. To the contrary, it will go down as a good example of what not to do.  Its failure does not have much to do with any inherent weaknesses attributed to digital currencies. The company was mismanaged and it was clearly in over its head. It would have been run into the ground even if it was a traditional financial institution and it would not be the first time.  Banks issue non-performing loans, credit card companies get scammed, insurers get defrauded – all this happens on a regular basis. When any of them happen to be run by incompetent people, they go under.  In case the ripple effect of their collapse is too big for the economy to take, governments get involved – usually with heaps of taxpayer money. So why all the focus on bitcoin?  Your money is safe, unless the government wants it  ""Money invested in banks, stocks, bonds or commodities is safer than money invested in speculative assets."" This is another argument used by bitcoin critics, and it usually happens to be true. However, bank deposits aren't entirely safe.  Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne recently gave the HMRC the power to access private bank accounts to look for money that might be owed in taxes. The rule will only apply to Britons who have been asked to pay their taxes multiple times and who owe more than £1,000.  Debt collectors can seize money straight from the accounts, but they have to leave at least £5,000 in the targeted account.  While the move may surprise some Brits, many countries (including France and the US) have similar laws on the books and they routinely enforce them.  Civil rights advocates don't like the idea, as they believe it is an encroachment on liberties and privacy. They also question the legality of such plans, as they effectively allow the executive branch to ""raid"" accounts and seize people's money. They believe this is something for the judiciary to decide, as some tax debt could be disputed.  Richard Murphy, director of Tax Research UK, told the Huffington Post that the two issues need to be separated:  ""One is about people not paying tax debt. Measures to help recover this are reasonable, including the power to take assets. The other is taking payment when the debt is disputed. That is unacceptable.""  Acceptable or not, the HMRC now has the power to do so. If the debt is disputed, the taxpayer will be able to appeal, but by then the money will probably be seized. Once it is seized, the taxpayer will have 14 days to contact tax authorities and arrange a payment plan, or the taxman will keep the money.  Tax havens aren't what they used to be  There is a bit of a problem though. Tax dodgers tend to be aware of what they are doing and they go to great lengths to hide their money. This includes stashing it somewhere warm, with plenty of sunshine, in an offshore account. However, this is no longer as safe as it used to be.  A year ago the IMF agreed to help out Cyprus with a €10bn package, but in return it asked the government to do something that did not go down well with thousands of depositors.  The government was strong armed into imposing a one-time levy of 6.7% on deposits up to €100,000 and 9.9% on larger deposits.  That wasn't the end of it. The Central Bank of Cyprus then went to impose a levy of up to 47.5% on uninsured deposits. Account holders were supposed to compensated by bank stock equivalent to the levied amount, but in reality there was not much interest in holding stocks in a basket case banking sector.  Still, the big depositors in Cyprus (mostly Russian nouveau riche) should consider themselves lucky. In the early nineties many banks in Eastern Europe collapsed, leaving depositors to pursue compensation from the government. Some got bonds years after the fact, others got nothing. Depositors in Argentina, Yugoslavia, Zimbabwe and many other countries were exposed to hyperinflation, which ate up their life savings in no time.  However, the Cyprus levy did not do much to deter tax dodgers looking for untouchable offshore accounts. The Tax Justice Network estimates $21 – $32tn of hidden and stolen wealth stashed largely tax havens around the world. The bitcoin market cap stands at about $7.2bn.  So why exactly would anyone use digital currencies to dodge taxes, when it can clearly be done without them?  Digital currencies are not the answer  In some circles, digital currencies are viewed as a way of keeping the government out of the whole process, but this view is based on ideology rather than fact.  We would like to claim otherwise, but that would be disingenuous. Ideology and economics don't tend to mix well, much to the detriment of many totalitarian regimes and advocates of various utopian ideas.  For example, gold bugs came out of the woodwork following the 2008 financial crisis, but most of them have been silenced over the past year or two. The reason is simple: their predictions didn't pan out and people who invested in stocks over the last couple of years are now much better off than those who mixed ideology with economics and invested in gold.  Besides, if fear of big government is driving people to invest in gold or digital currencies, they might want to take a history lesson and read Roosevelt's Executive Order 6102, which criminalized the possession of monetary gold by citizens and non-governmental institutions.  The Roosevelt administration had good reason to do so and it acted in the interests of the people, during the worst economic crisis of the 20th century. If a totalitarian government turns against its people, strings of digits that rely on electricity the internet to make any sense won't help. A few cans of beans or any item that can be bartered would be more helpful than all the bitcoins out there.  Digital currencies should not be viewed as a hedge, nor are they a viable alternative to traditional long-term investments or even national currencies backed by central banks.  They can, however, complement national currencies, reduce transaction fees, make microtransactions possible and change the way content is monetized. It is their efficiency makes them interesting and potentially very useful. They should derive their value from their efficiency and their ability to save value rather than store it.  As for bad apples, it's the government's job to weed them out whether they run dodgy bitcoin exchanges or dodgy investment firms.

The exchange indicated the transactions will display as ""affiliate payment"" or ""refund affiliate payment"" on credit card statements. It added that funds can be sent to cards in any country and that on some cards such transactions would not be possible due to restrictions imposed by banks.  Added BTC-e:  ""Some credit cards that do not allow [you] to have a positive balance cannot be funded. If payout to your card is not possible, then we will immediately notify you and refund the money back to your account.""  Renewed activity  The news follows what appears to be an increasingly active period of experimentation from the major exchange in regards to its offerings, notably following the insolvency of its one-time major competitor Mt. Gox.  On 28th February  , it cut withdrawal fees via some of its third-party services in a move that increased the ease with which some customers would be able to move funds out of the exchange.  The moves also come in the wake of increasing attention from the mainstream media and warnings from major investors about the exchange's practices.

42397425,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb9M2K,1395417004,BTC Price Declines Following False Report of Bitcoin Ban in China,"Updated 15:00 GMT: Updated with commentary from co-founder of BitAngelsClub Eric Gu.  A false report published on a financial news feed run by Chinese microblogging site Sina Weibo was responsible for the sharp decline in bitcoin prices across China's biggest exchanges today (21st March).  At 10:22 am GMT, Sina's financial live feed issued a now-retracted news report indicating that China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), would move to halt all bitcoin transactions in the country effective 15th April.  If true, the news would have interrupted a period of improved relations between the burgeoning bitcoin ecosystem and the nation's lawmakers, but coincided with the PBOC's temporary ban on QR codes issued last week.  Read the initial news statement from Sina:  ""It is rumored that on March 18th the PBOC had issued a notice calling for all bitcoin transactions to be halted by April 15th. As of today the PBOC has not confirmed nor denied the statement.""  The story was later retracted by the news site following clarification from Chinese regulators, in a release issued more than an hour later at 11:48 GMT on 21st March.  Read a translation of the updated post:  ""Regarding the PBOC statement issued on 3/18 requesting all bitcoin transactions to be halted before 4/15, those close to the regulatory body told Sina Finance on Friday, the PBOC did issue a document, but it was not to ban/halt bitcoin transactions, instead to strengthen regulatory oversight of bitcoin transactions, circulation and redemptions.""    The PBOC later took to the Weibo platform and Twitter to clarify the news.    ""The report by certain media that 'PBOC has issued a document as of 3/18, requesting all bitcoin transactions be halted by 4/15' is in error. The attitude of the PBOC towards bitcoin has been clearly stated by the [5th December] document issued by the PBOC and five other agencies.""  The company acknowledged the damage its report caused, noting that it ""quickly caused panic in the bitcoin community"", and that ""bitcoin's domestic prices [were] likely to fall significantly"" as a result of its error.  CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index indicates that the price of bitcoin was down 2%, or roughly $12 on the news, though prices were impacted more severely on China-based bitcoin exchanges.  Price decline  Sina indicated that its report caused the price of bitcoin to fall 5%, dropping from 3,691 yuan ($592.99) to 3,400 yuan ($546.24), though a closer look at bitcoin price data across the major China-based exchanges shows the damage was far worse for certain investors.  Data from Bitcoincharts suggests the price of bitcoin on BTC China hit a low of 3,301 yuan at 11:00am GMT, dropping from 3,568 in just 30 minutes.  BitcoinWisdom shows that China-based exchange OKCoin experienced a more aggressive fall in price, crashing from around 3,600 yuan to 3,100 and below from 10:30am GMT to 11:00am GMT.  BitcoinWisdom's Huobi data shows a similar decline on this exchange, from roughly 3,600 yuan to a low of approximately 3,200 yuan within the same time window.  Community reaction  Community members reactions ranged from begrudgingly bemused to irate, with some reddit users falling into the former camp given the fact that China's stance on digital currencies has seemingly changed frequently over the last few months.  Others suggested that the digital currency's susceptibility to such negative news is a weakness that will hinder adoption.  Reaction in China's bitcoin business community leaned more toward outrage at the news organization's seemingly negligent reporting.  VC investor and CoinDesk contributor Rui Ma took to Twitter to clarify the news, and voice her frustrations about the actions of the social media giant.    Total BS: Sina finance had news 18:22 on #Bitcoin trxn banned by 4/15 by PBOC. THEN IT'S DELETED after panic. %$#@?! http://t.co/hZeeIQpezd      — Rui Ma (@ruima) March 21, 2014    Eric Gu, co-founder of BitAnglesClub, an international incubator focused on digital currencies, chose to view the events with a hint of optimism. Though, he acknowledged that they are evidence of the fragile state of China's market.  ""The fact that [the] Chinese central bank swiftly came out off working hour to dismiss the rumor indicated that [it] has no plan to shutdown bitcoin exchanges any time soon.""  At press time, the price the price of bitcoin on BTC China had recovered to a low of 3,519 ($565.36 at press time), though this was down from an opening low of 3,654 yuan, suggesting that the damage from the report was still impacting the market.

42374543,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvlHAR,1395414257,Money-Spinners: This Week's Bitcoin ATM News,"Take out your smartphones and get those palms warmed up for a scanning, because it’s time for CoinDesk’s weekly bitcoin ATM roundup.  Each day, the army of bitcoin ATMs across the globe grows in number, and firepower. The many users feeding their fiat into these machines are not only receiving bitcoin, but helping to build the economy of the future.  In this week's bitcoin ATM news roundup, Jon Southurst tracks down the latest models to touch down.  California  Robocoin launched its first two-way bitcoin ATM in Mountain View, California, on Thursday at the 500 Startups 'Bitcoinference' – a half-day 'unconference' of bitcoin startups in one of the world's tech capitals.  Robocoin CEO Jordan Kelley again promoted his machine's security and compliance features as its biggest selling points, saying: ""Our Robocoin Operator shares our vision of bringing bitcoin to the world the right way.""  Singapore  CoinRepublic, in association with Canada's Bitcoiniacs, is launching Asia's first Robocoin two-way ATM, allowing users to both buy and sell bitcoin. CoinRepublic is in the process of registering the service for local KYC (know your customer) compliance.  This is Singapore's seventh bitcoin machine, and fourth different brand of such, which is probably the current world record. It's significant, especially, for an independent country only 276 square miles (716.1 sq/km) in area.  Taiwan  Taiwan's regulators said earlier this year they would not allow Robocoin machines and, true to their word, they haven't yet.  Instead there is a new Lamassu vending machine being installed in a cafe to dispense bitcoins to an eager public.  Dubai  Sources say there are 400 bitcoin ATMs sitting ready to go online in Dubai. Given Dubai's ability to deliver on hyperbolic promises over the past 20 years, it would be wise to believe that claim even before the machines are installed, functioning, and filmed.  — Sergey Yusupov (@uniqbiun) March 18, 2014  Till then, there is this report for you to make up your own minds.  Malaysia  Singapore company Numoni, which already has two machines up and running in its home country, will launch the first bitcoin vending machine in Malaysia on Friday, according to a news report.  The article also mentions that Numoni has launched a machine in Indonesia, but sources there say it is instead coming soon, along with plans for other brands.  The Netherlands  Finally, an intriguing story from Holland. After receiving word via reddit that the Bitcoin Boulevard event in the Hague needed an ATM at short notice, Bitcoin Suisse AG decided to help out.  As recently reported on CoinDesk, Bitcoin Boulevard is the new unofficial title of two popular canal-side streets in the Hague. All nine restaurants and an art gallery on the stretch recently decided to start accepting bitcoin and adopt the new title from the 20th March.  However, someone realised that if the idea was to be encouraging people to start using bitcoin, customers would need an ATM to buy some. Quickly, the call was put out and Bitcoin Suisse took up the challenge, later saying on reddit:  ""After changing our Lamassu ATMs from CHF to EUR, packing our gear, and a death defying Jaguar race across Europe to [the Hague], we set up a bitcoin ATM in the Eten bij Werelds restaurant.""  Now thanks to Bitcoin Suisse, Holland joins Malaysia and Taiwan in having its first chance to spend some cryptocurrency purchased through a bitcoin ATM.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/21/money-spinners-this-weeks-bitcoin-atm-news,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/37d26ba8e3d93b487fcf0b0eb1a5ce14493cfa9f-2448x2333.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Gox has released a new press release confirming that it found an old-format bitcoin wallet on 7th March containing 199,999.99 BTC ($113.9m at press time).  Mt. Gox further confirmed it reported the finding to its bankruptcy counsels as required by its civil rehabilitation proceedings.  The release states:  ""A hearing took place on March 8 where a detailed explanation of the situation was made to counsels. Immediately on Monday (March 10), counsels reported the existence of the 200,000 BTC to the Court and the Supervisor.""  The exchange revealed it now has a total amount of 202,000 BTC, a figure which includes the 200,000 BTC recently found, as well as an additional 2,000 BTC ($1.1m) in funds.  Mt. Gox confirms money movement  The release, penned by CEO Mark Karpeles, indicated that the wallets were moved from online wallets to offline storage from 14th March to 15th March. Further, he confirmed that the courts were aware of this activity.  ""These bitcoin movements (including the change in the manner in which these bitcoins were stored) has been reported to the Court and the Supervisor by counsels.""  The confirmation would suggest reports that Mt. Gox funds have been moving through the blockchain were valid, though the dates of the movement do not coincide.  Missing bitcoin figures revised  Mt. Gox indicated that with the finding, the amount of bitcoins it reported as lost or stolen needs to be revised, suggesting that this wallet, and the funds therein, were factored into the original estimate.  Said the statement:  ""Taking into account the existence of the 200,000 BTC, the total number of bitcoins which have disappeared is therefore estimated to be approximately 650,000 BTC.""

42397432,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb9M4I,1395400296,"Bitcoinference California: Women in Bitcoin, VCs, and the 'Unconference'","One hundred and fifty people attended Bitcoinference, a half-day event devoted to cryptocurrencies, on Thursday (March 20th) in Mountain View, California.  The sellout event, held at the offices of incubator 500 Startups, consisted of a keynote speech, two panel sessions, a networking session and an 'unconference' portion – the latter melding a traditional event agenda with increased attendee social interaction.  Several speakers during the formal session of the event expressed concern about negative news related to bitcoin in recent weeks. But it was perhaps Zeroblock co-founder Dan Held that expressed the best sense of cautious optimism for the remainder of the year:  ""2014 is when you're going to see the amateurs get shaken out of the market and the people with really good dev teams start taking over the process.""  Keynote address  500 Startups partner Sean Percival kicked the event off with an attention-grabbing stunt. Attendees were told to look underneath their seats, where they found envelops containing paper wallets – most worth $5-worth of bitcoin.  After that, the first guest on the agenda was Dan Held, a Product Manager at Blockchain.info. Held's Zeroblock mobile app was purchased by Blockchain.info late last year in an all-bitcoin acquisition.  Sean Percival hosted a Q&A session with Held, who predicted that bitcoin's price over the course of this year would rocket:  ""I'm pretty optimistic about the price – to the moon,"" Held said, with a joke more often associated with dogecoin.  Held also brought up Zeroblock's recent recent acquisition of market visualization provider RTBTC. Zeroblock is planning to bring additional cyrptocurrencies to RTBTC's charting and trading at some point down the line, he said.  Women in bitcoin  Next up was a discussion moderated by TechZulu co-founder Amanda Coolong and titled the ""51% Attack Panel: Changing the Ratio for Women in Bitcoin"". The session featured bitcoin investor Arianna Simpson, BitGive Executive Director Connie Gallippi and Spelunk.in founder Pinguino Kolb.  The majority of the panel said that their experiences as women within the bitcoin sphere had been generally positive. Arianna Simpson, though, talked about how it has been a bit of bumpy road personally, something that she described in a blog post back in January.  Bitcoin for now is a predominantly male pursuit, but mass adoption will change that, they said. What has happened with technologies such as social networking is a good example of women bringing technology to critical mass. Furthermore, said Kolb""  ""[Bitcoin] is fun. It's the internet of money.""  The global scope of bitcoin is what really excited Gallippi. Her company BitGive charitably donates bitcoin for public health and environmental issues.  ""For profit or nonprofit, it blows open a whole global marketplace,"" she said.  Bitcoin investment  An investors' forum was next up on the schedule. Called ""Mining VC Panel: Fundraising for Bitcoin Companies"", the panel consisted of Boost VC CEO Adam Draper, angel investor Brock Pierce and Freestyle's Principle Joyce Kim.  The VC panel was moderated by Dave McClure, founding partner of 500 Startups.  It was interesting to hear the perspectives from different angles of bitcoin investment: a fund (Kim), an accelerator (Draper) and an angel (Pierce).  Joyce Kim, who runs a seed fund called Freestyle Capital, told the audience that whether it is bitcoin or some other technology, startups need to have good leaders in order to thrive:  ""You need great founders to take anything anywhere.""  Brock Pierce said that he has invested in 12 crytpocurrency startups already this year. His investment portfolio consists mainly of bitcoin and altcoin companies, he said, and he sees good things ahead in terms of the regulatory environment, saying:  ""The US has been more positive than I expected.""  Adam Draper of Boost VC reiterated his recent commitment to funding 100 bitcoin startups over the next three years. At over 30 startups per year, Boost will have to cast a wide net.  Draper sees exciting prospects ahead in altcoins, such as dogecoin, which he described as ""fascinating"".  Dave McClure quipped that dogecoin might be bitcoin's best advertising strategy:  ""Dogecoin is the best marketing for bitcoin ever.""  The 'unconference'  After the more formal sessions, Bitcoinference broke into 'unconference' mode. Anyone interested in hosting a session was welcome – with a board set up for three time slots in three different rooms.  The sessions were fairly informal and niche in nature.  The unconference portion turned the idea of the passive conference-goer on its head. The first portion of Bitcoinference was noticably short on Q&A time, and this unusual session gave attendees ample time to network and share ideas in a informal setting.  ""The unconference is the ideal format for an emerging industry like bitcoin"", Sean Percival told CoinDesk, adding:  ""Several attendees stopped me to tell me that [unconference] was the best networking and knowledge sharing they've ever experienced at a bitcoin event.""  Some of the popular unconference sessions included ""Startup Opportunities Beyond BTC"" and ""Dogecoin to the Moon!"".  About 500 Startups  500 Startups  occupies an entire 12th-floor building space in downtown Mountain View.  The company has accelerated over 200 startups in the past year, according to Percival, and recently announced that it will begin accepting bitcoin startups into the program.  Percival will be running 500's upcoming incubator class, with a small number of bitcoin startups taking part.  A former MySpace executive who has worked on marketing projects for Blockchain.info, Percival says that 500 Startups plans to accelerate 10 to 20 bitcoin startups per year going forward.  The startups they select must have a solid track record of working on projects within the cryptocurrency community, Percival told CoinDesk.  Bitcoinference was held in conjunction with 500 Startups' Commercism conference – a full day event focused on exploring ecommerce topics. Commercism is being held today, March 21st, at the Microsoft Conference Center in Mountain View.",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | TRADING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/21/bitcoinference-california-women-in-bitcoin-vcs-and-the-unconference,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/09f789596b9b3492754a98e556df55feab499b63-1206x682.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397415,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb9LsU,1395379376,Spondoolies-Tech Promises More Power-Efficient Mining,"An Israeli company launched a bitcoin mining system this week that promises to eventually double existing power efficiencies. Spondoolies-Tech is touting mining rigs that will offer up to 2.1 TH/sec per kilowatt of energy today by the summer.  The company has designed an ASIC chip that it says can achieve a similar performance to the design currently used by ASIC mining manufacturers such as Cointerra. The difference, says Spondoolies-Tech cofounder Guy Corem, is the process node; Cointerra uses a 28nm (nanometer) ASIC chip design, whereas Spondoolies-Tech uses a 40nm design.  The process node in a computer chip is the resolution of the components on the chip. Smaller numbers mean a higher resolution, and hence more microscopic transistors in a certain area. This has two benefits: it increases the speed that the transistors can operate at, and it also lowers the power consumption.  So how does Corem claim to have matched Cointerra with a larger process node? Using smarter code, and better physical design, he explained.  ""I have a non-standard implementation of SHA-256 [the cryptographic software algorithm used by the Bitcoin protocol], as well as a very good physical implementation of the engine on the ASIC,"" said Corem.  One thing he claims to have done is reduce the 'toggle rate' of the chips - meaning the number of times that the tiny electrical components have to switch electrical state.  The company started taking orders this week for its SP-10 unit, codenamed 'Dawson'. It is targeting consumers with the device, which provides 1.4 TH/sec of computing power for 1.2kW of energy. That equates to 1.17 GH/watt.  This compares to 0.95 GH/Watt based on the published specification of Cointerra's latest TerraMiner IV. Although CoinDesk reported last month that the Cointerra unit had fallen short of that performance figure. Based on reported performance in the field, the true figure would be more like 0.8 GH/Watt.  The SP-10 sells for $4,995, while the TerraMiner – which doesn't ship its next units until June – costs $5,999.  All of this makes Spondoolies-Tech an appealing unit, at least in theory. The company opened its store on Wednesday, and appears to be enjoying early successes.  When CoinDesk spoke to Corem last week, he said that he expects to sell around 20 of these units in March, and around 2-300 of them in April, with more coming in May, based on deliveries of chips from TSMC subsidiary Global Unichip. Based on those numbers, he's done very well, as after his first day he is now displaying a May shipment date.  Spondoolies-Tech has raised over $5.5m in funding. This came from two Israeli venture capital firms: Genesis Partners, and BRM. $1m came from a group of angel investors.  This will help it to develop and promote its second unit, the SP-30, codenamed Yukon, which promises a bigger power-performance jump. This will deliver 5.4 TH/sec of computing power using 2.4Kw, the firm says. On the site, it publicizes a 2.1 TH/kW (2.1 GH/Watt) performance figure for the box, which is scheduled to ship in August.  The power boost there comes from the process node improvement; that $11,995 unit will contain 30 28nm chips, compared to 192 40nm chips in the SP-10.  Counterintuitively, these boxes are being targeted at consumers, but they're designed for datacentres; they're provided in a 1.25u rack-mountable server format.  ""Later on, we will serve to vendors like CloudHashing, or whoever wants this very dense miner. Then we will develop special software for the datacentre,"" Corem said.  For now, though, he's focusing on making the box consumer friendly, with a user interface designed for newcomers.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2014/03/21/spondoolies-tech-promises-more-power-efficient-mining,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a118f8cb94ecb71b7b1edc74c0fc758833cd9ac9-1000x666.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
