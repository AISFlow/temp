42377156,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zDkz,1397682987,"Dogecoin Founder, Enthusiasts Set For San Francisco Convention","Dogecoin creator Jackson Palmer is set to headline 'Dogecon SF' in San Francisco, an upcoming gathering presented by Follow The Coin in partnership with Palmer and the Dogecoin Foundation.  The 25th April event will celebrate the short but dramatic history of the altcoin. Beginning at 4pm, Dogecon SF will feature food, fun, panel discussions and opportunities to win some dogecoin. Entry is free, although donations are encouraged.  Palmer told CoinDesk that the evening of all things shibe embodies everything positive about the dogecoin community:  “Dogecoin is based, at its core, around a passionate community of users who are a fine example of how generosity and light-heartedness can prevail on the often mean-spirited internet. Dogecon is an extension of that community drive, and my hope is that it'll bring together shibes for a night of crypto-education, discussion and a heap of fun.”  An event for every shibe  A number of speakers are set to appear at the convention, billed as the largest dogecoin gathering yet.  Litecoin creator Charlie Lee will join Palmer for a ""fireside chat"". Dogetipbot co-founder David Dvorak and Doge4Water creator Eric Nakagawa will lead a panel discussion focusing on the community’s charity efforts.  Andreas Antonopoulos, the bitcoin evangelist and author of the forthcoming book 'Mastering Bitcoin', will lead a talk entitled 'Currency As A Language: Understanding value in a world of thousands of currency publishers'.  Following the panels, Dogecon SF will break into full-on party mode, with games and events that offer free dogecoins to lucky winners. Said Palmer:  “We'll have pizza, beer, a DJ and even a best dressed content where I'll award the finest dressed shibe with a whopping 100k DOGE.”  San Francisco's Adam’s Grub Truck will serve refreshments.  Convention highlights dogecoin community  Palmer told CoinDesk that he hopes people who don’t know much about digital currencies attend Dogecon SF, and that one of the successes of dogecoin has been its attraction for those previously unfamiliar with the concept.  “We're attracting and bringing in an entirely new demographic of users who mostly haven't dealt with cryptocurrency before. All cryptocurrencies need to start reaching a wider circle of users, if they ever expect to see mass adoption.”  Dogecoin enthusiasts have grown steadily in number since the digital currency’s launch. This list includes reddit CEO Yishan Wong.  Earlier this month, a gathering of shibes was held at Meltdown Comics in Los Angeles.

However, the company has added a new page to their website for ""market making"" as clarified by founder and CEO Barry Silbert over Twitter:    FYI, we did NOT launch a digital currency exchange today. Just added a new web page for our bitcoin ""market making"" https://t.co/PoeNmfN2ZS      — Barry Silbert (@barrysilbert) April 16, 2014        New York-based SecondMarket previously confirmed that it will launch a professional-level bitcoin exchange service for institutional traders (including banks, hedge funds, brokers and bitcoin companies) later this year.  That effort is still ongoing, and will be separate from the SecondMarket brand acccording to Barry Silbert:  ""This is not the digital exchange effort, which will be launched separate from SecondMarket under a different name,"" he said.  SecondMarket, a registered broker-dealer that has experience offering unique asset classes and alternative investments, is already targeting investors interested in trading a minimum of 25 BTC per trade for its market making service.  Notably, however, that level of bitcoin trading is in a market that has seen bitcoin exchanges struggle to fill orders, according to investors familiar with institution-level BTC trading.  25 BTC minimum  According to recent CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index values, 25 BTC is worth more than $12,000.  SecondMarket, as a result, is targeting investors who seek to move large amounts of bitcoin, a market that only a few companies are currently able to provide.  For example, companies such as itBit, Vaurum and most recently CoinMKT have intentions of reaching the financial world with bitcoin investment platforms.  SecondMarket made an announcement that it would get into the bitcoin exchange business earlier this year, and this is a new landing page to attract accredited investors through its website.  According to information posted on the SecondMarket site, aspiring exchange customers must first complete a compliance application and speak with one of the exchange's representatives before trading.  Bitcoin Investment Trust  SecondMarket also offers a product called the Bitcoin Investment Trust, which founder Barry Silbert says already holds 100,000 bitcoins. Silbert has long been bullish on the long-term prospects of bitcoin, and his connections to the financial world give SecondMarket a degree of credibility in the digital currency industry.    Big milestone today for Bitcoin Investment Trust -- now holds over 100,000 bitcoin http://t.co/nBzlaGupy4 cc @BitcoinTrust      — Barry Silbert (@barrysilbert) April 10, 2014    Silbert recently told CoinDesk that 15% of institutional investors were already bitcoin believers.  Adam Draper, founder of Boost VC, which invests in bitcoin companies, shared his thoughts on the launch with CoinDesk:  ""I think that Barry Silbert is one of the lead pioneers and innovators in the Bitcoin space. He is really sticking his neck out for mass adoption of bitcoin and I love it.""  With hedge funds such as Pantera Capital going all-bitcoin, and the support of Fortress Investments and others, interest from Wall Street seems to be on the rise.  Bankers and investment professionals are also expected to mingle with bitcoin professionals at Money 2020 later on this year, an annual event that will attract thousands in the finance industry.

UK-based users are now able to sell products on the website for bitcoin as an option in CeX's shopping cart.  The cart informs users that they will receive the BTC equivalent fair value at the time a good is sold:  ""Your actual bitcoin payout will be determined at the time of payment processing, after we have received and tested your goods.""  Selling items for bitcoin  The decision for CeX to take bitcoin for used goods follows a recent trend in the bitcoin industry.  A few companies now allow users to sell old products for bitcoin. It's an easy onramp for bitcoin newcomers to get some digital currency for products that they no longer want.  CeX's trade-in model is similar to that of MintSpare, a startup that accepts electronics in exchange for bitcoin. Another company called Glyde also pays out its customers in bitcoin for used products.  However, Glyde functions like a marketplace: a seller's item must be matched with a buyer that wants the product. Also, MintSpare and Glyde are both US-based and focus on that particular market.  About CeX  Founded in London in 1992, CeX has stores in the US, UK, Spain, Ireland, India and Australia.  According to the company's website, it has 243 physical UK retail locations.

42377165,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zDxZ,1397671906,New Colorado Marijuana Vending Machines Will Accept Bitcoin,"Marijuana vending machines have long been rumored to debut en masse in certain US states, but the first machine that can be accessed directly by consumers was finally unveiled at an invite-only event in Colorado last week.  Billed as the first marijuana vending machine in America, the ZaZZZ unit is perhaps more accurately described as the first machine that will not be placed behind a sales counter. It offers a number of novel compliance features, including a driver's license reader and a camera that captures video of users.  ZaZZZ machines also have another notable feature: they accept only a limited number of payment options including the ZaZZZ Card, cash, and perhaps most notably, bitcoin.  Stephen Shearin, COO of American Green – the makers of ZaZZZ – spoke to CoinDesk about why bitcoin is the right fit for his brand. He said:  ""It’s quick, it’s efficient, it’s trackable.”  How the machines work  ZaZZZ indicates that its machines will serve as an ancillary service for dispensaries, appealing to those who want to make purchases quickly or who might otherwise be shy about buying marijuana.    #zazzz we will be starting a new web series talking about all the products that will go in the machine! pic.twitter.com/YgyJiE1jy3      — Herbal Elements (@HerbalColorado) April 16, 2014    Shearin explained that customers paying with bitcoins will find a transaction system nearly identical to that at merchants who accept bitcoin:  ""It's exactly like [using your] bitcoin wallet to pay anywhere else.""  Once customers have selected their product, they move to the payment stage – where they can then opt to pay in bitcoin. The vending machine produces a QR Code which the customer can then scan with their smartphone.  Once the machine accepts the bitcoins, the customer takes their product and the transaction is completed.  Two growing markets meet  Medical marijuana has been legal in Colorado since Amendment 20 passed in 2000. The policy was followed in 2012 by Amendment 64, which allows for the personal use of marijuana by all adults aged at least 21 in the state.  However, while the policy is not new, the retail infrastructure to support the change has been slow to roll out. For instance, the first marijuana stores only opened on 1st January of this year.  The relationship between bitcoin and marijuana in Colorado began with the use of the digital currency by dispensaries who, at the time, were unable to find financial partners.  Some observers see the legal obstacles facing marijuana as similar to those experienced by bitcoin.  According to Shearin, the use of bitcoin allows businesses in the cannabis industry a way to improve margins that are already tight after taxes and the cost of regulatory compliance. He explained:  ""Providing a payment facility that has a super-low cost to it, like bitcoin, is an effective way to provide these guys – dispensaries and dispensary owners – with a means of doing their business that is more efficient than other facilities that charge a higher fee.""  Shearin went on to say that the grassroots nature of the digital currency movement, as well as its value-oriented benefits for customers like low transaction fees, made implementing bitcoin a clear choice.

42377169,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zE1L,1397669437,Is Bitcoin Over the Hill?,"Is bitcoin getting the same attention it once was?  Some are suggesting that the digital currency is losing its lustre, as enthusiasm wanes. But, how can we measure that, and whose enthusiasm are we talking about exactly?  The technology industry can be a fickle and fashion-led business. Research firm Gartner even has a name for it: the hype cycle. The cycle is a line graph charted on two axes, with visibility on the vertical, and maturity on the horizontal.  It starts with a technology trigger (that would be Satoshi's invention of the distributed consensus network model that supports bitcoin): the technology's visibility rises, quickly shooting to unsustainable levels, as it begins appearing more in the media, and on PowerPoint slides everywhere.  Soon after, the technology fails to meet those inflated expectations. Experiments fail, and failures shake out. Visibility slumps. After this readjustment, the world realises that there is a way forward, but that it's more practical. Having shaken off the unsustainable expectations, people begin to see how the technology could benefit them.  Finally, the technology reaches the plateau of productivity. Visibility will never be as high as it was at the peak of excitement in the early days, but that's no bad thing. Exuberance has been replaced by evidence, and the technology is accepted.  The hype cycle shows up a lot with enterprise technology markets, which are abuzz with fashions, but it may also apply to bitcoin. One recent post on the Bitcoin Talk forum sounded irreconcilably gloomy:  ""The truth is that the general bitcoin community is growing tired. Tired of falling prices. Tired of scandals like Mt. Gox. Tired of rigs they invested in not paying off like they hoped. Tired of maintaining those rigs.""  It later attacked mining companies for scamming users and lambasted the altcoin community for tarnishing bitcoin's credibility:  ""Crap coin after crap coin which honestly just makes the whole industry look like a joke. Potcoin. Dogecoin. It makes the technology look like a circus for morons yet more coins come out every day and are backed by exchanges that represent the industry.""  Has bitcoin started the inexorable descent into the trough of disillusionment? If so, how can we tell?  Over the hill?  Visibility is often tied to media coverage.  Jerry Brito  , who directs the technology policy program at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, says that the story angles have changed, reducing the options for juicy media coverage.  ""At one point, bitcoin and virtual currencies were a novel and interesting story. The sexier angles including Silk Road were there. Since the novelty has warn off and the bad actors are being driven out of the ecosystem, they have lost interest.""  When you're heading down into the trough of disillusionment, a technology's failures – such as Mt Gox's collapse – are centre stage. It's easy to write apocalyptic stories during this period. But, when the rate of embarrassing public implosions slows, these sexy headlines are harder to find.  Quantifying the amount of mainstream media coverage is beyond CoinDesk's scope, but we can quantify Google searches, and they're down. Querying trends on bitcoin as a topic, rather than search term, shows a strong spike in interest last April, followed by an even stronger increase at the end of last year.  Someone on Quora suggested price as an alternative metric for tracking enthusiasm around bitcoin. The price fluctuations seem broadly correlated with Google search trends for bitcoin.  The price increased around the same time that the search volume rose last April. The searches tracked the price again at the end of the year. Sure enough, when the price fell in January, searches plummeted – and continue to fall. They seem to not just track the price, but react violently to it.  Which community?  All of these might be ways to measure the level of enthusiasm for bitcoin, but we may be missing something. One of the most telling things about the 'waning enthusiasm' Bitcoin Talk post is how the commenter references the bitcoin community.  That may be oversimplistic.  Long-time bitcoin entrepreneur Erik Voorhees, who last year sold SatoshiDice, points out that bitcoin has many voices:  ""There are many groups, I'd probably categorize as follows: developers/tech enthusiasts, entrepreneurs, investors, observers (including the media), 'hardcore bitcoiners' and 'softcore bitcoiners'. The former are those for whom bitcoin is a lifestyle. The latter are just those who enjoy using bitcoin sometimes.""  Referring to the ""bitcoin community"" is like referring to the web community, agrees Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle.  He focuses on one of bitcoin's sub-communities that seems resolutely committed to bitcoin: people looking to build longer-term investments and services from it:  ""I'm actually seeing the opposite of this thread – increasing levels of interest from business leaders, government, other entrepreneurs, investors.""  Many in that community, including Allaire, are building the foundations for online services and investments designed for longevity. Barry Silbert announced yesterday that he has 100,000 bitcoins in his investment trust, for example.  Venture capital firms are investing more, rather than less, in bitcoin, tripling the 2014 run rate over the total 2013 investment rate in short order, thanks to a flurry of investments.  But these are informed individuals, playing a long-term game. Bitcoin has been visible to these types for a long time. Many non-bitcoin users still haven't heard of the digital currency – or think that it's dead, following the collapse of Mt Gox. Are bitcoin advocates educating them quickly enough?  ""By no means does the general public understand bitcoin, but they are surely closer to understanding than they were a year ago,"" says Curtis Fenimore, a bitcoin activist who has been busy trying to spread the word.  Ultimately, media coverage of bitcoin, and sentiment about it on the forums, will fluctuate wildly, because both the mainstream media, and some of the people using it, are fickle.  Voorhees suggests that there are two broad types of enthusiasm:  ""On one hand, you have the deep, long-run, 'I've dedicated my life to bitcoin'-type enthusiasm. On the other hand, you have more fleeting, superficial 'excitement of the moment'-type enthusiasm.""  You can measure the first by counting new bitcoin ventures and investments, he suggests, while the Google searches and mainstream media headlines denote the second.  Dilettantes, dabblers and those wanting to make a fast buck will run hot and cold when it comes to bitcoin, as positive and negative events occur. Mainstream media outlets will feed the fire while the headlines are there. People will say it's dead, while others will predict the overthrow of the banking system. These are the normal activities that we come to expect as a disruptive currency moves along the path to maturity.  But, that's the point. It isn't so much the technology itself that reaches excessive highs and lows as it rolls relentlessly through the Gartner hype cycle; it's the public opinion that fluctuates around it.

42377163,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zDq1,1397665129,US Federal Reserve Official Says He's Interested in Bitcoin Technology,"A representative of the US Federal Reserve spoke out about bitcoin today at a town hall meeting at North Dakota State University, Reuters reports.  Addressing the audience, Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Narayana Kocherlakota indicated he is interested in bitcoin's underlying technology, but not its use as a currency.  Kocherlakota also responded to the suggestion that bitcoin could ever become a legitimate competitor to the US dollar, stating:  ""That's where I think the interest of it is, myself, as opposed to a new currency that's going to drive the US dollar out of circulation.""  The development notably follows Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen's statements on the subject during an address to the Senate Banking Committee in February.  During that meeting  , Yellen noted that the Fed ""doesn't have authority to supervise or regulate bitcoin"" in response to concerned questions by US Senator Joe Manchin.  About the Federal Reserve  As the central banking system for the United States, the Federal Reserve issues the nation's coin and paper currency, though separate bureaus handle subsequent work.  Yellen became one of the first members of the agency to address bitcoin in February following the initial bankruptcy filing of Mt. Gox. During that address, she indicated that she saw bitcoin regulation as a matter for Congress, but downplayed the idea that the digital currency could in some way be regulated.  Said Yellen  :  ""It’s not so easy to regulate bitcoin because there is no central issuer or network operator to regulate.""  The Fed has most recently sparked controversy with its quantitative easing program that aimed at bolstering the US economy following the 2008 financial crisis.  About Kocherlakota  A graduate of the University of Chicago, Kocherlaokta became the president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis in October 2009.  There, he oversaw the operations of the bank, including supervision, regulation and payment services, according to his Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis bio. Kocherlakota was also named one of the top 100 Global Thinkers by Foreign Policy magazine in 2012.

42377152,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zDhD,1397658919,Linguistic Researchers Name Nick Szabo as Author of Bitcoin Whitepaper,"A group of forensic linguistics experts from Aston University believe the real creator of bitcoin is former law professor Nick Szabo.  This is not the first time Szabo has been outed as the ‘real’ Satoshi Nakamoto. Last December researcher Skye Grey analyzed the now infamous bitcoin whitepaper and came to the same conclusion.  Linguistic analysis is a technique often employed by criminal investigators and intelligence agencies, among other organisations. While it is not a foolproof method, in many cases it is the only means of gathering vital intelligence from documents.  So why are different researchers pointing to the same conclusion?  Linguistic traits and ticks  The Aston University Centre for Forensic Linguistics, based in Birmingham, UK, unleashed 40 final-year students on Satoshi’s bitcoin whitepaper.  The team, headed by lecturer Dr Jack Grieve, compared the paper to the writing of 11 other individuals that have been named as Satoshi Nakamoto at one point in time.  The list of ‘suspects’ included; Dorian S Nakamoto; Vili Lehdonvirta; Michael Clea; Shinichi Mochizuki; Gavin Andresen; Nick Szabo; Jed McCaleb; Dustin D Trammel; Hal Finney; Wei Dai; Neal King, Vladimir Oksman and Charles Bry.  The team concluded that Szabo is the primary author of the bitcoin paper and, therefore, the probable creator of bitcoin.  Dr Grieve explained:  “The number of linguistic similarities between Szabo’s writing and the bitcoin whitepaper is uncanny, none of the other possible authors were anywhere near as good of a match.""  He continued: “We are pretty confident that out of the primary suspects Nick Szabo is the main author of the paper, though we can’t rule out the possibility that others contributed. Our study adds to the weight of evidence pointing towards Nick Szabo.""  The team found that Szabo was by far the closest match, with a large number of distinct linguistic traits appearing in the bitcoin paper and in Szabo’s blogs and other writings.  The phrases included: “trusted third parties”, “for our purposes”, “need for ...”, “chain of ...” among others. The bitcoin paper also includes commas before ‘and’ and ‘but’, plenty of hyphenation, ‘-ly’ adverbs, pronouns ‘we’ and ‘our’ in a paper supposedly written by a single author.  Furthermore, the researchers found that the bitcoin whitepaper was drafted using Latex, an open-source document preparation system. Latex is also used by Szabo for all his publications.  Skye Grey's analysis  Researcher Skye Grey came to eerily similar conclusions in his analysis of the bitcoin whitepaper published last year.  Grey found that that both Szabo and the author of the whitepaper tended to use the expression “trusted third party” repeatedly. The expression “for our purposes” was also singled out, along with “it should be noted”.  Grey went a step further. He pointed out that most of the unusual wording found in the bitcoin whitepaper can also be found in “recurring occurrences”. He concluded that the use of American English in the whitepaper may have been a deliberate attempt to obscure its origins.  Grey concluded:  ""However, the bitcoin paper may have had several authors, Nick being merely the main one.""  He also pointed out that the author was very familiar with concepts similar to bitcoin and that he referenced Wei Dai’s b-money, hashcash and other concepts. Oddly enough, Szabo’s bit gold was not mentioned despite the fact that bitcoin was clearly influenced by the concept.  In an interview with TechCrunch, Grey said he is in contact with two persons who are running their independent analysis of the whitepaper to confirm his claims.  He also pointed out that Satoshi did not cite any of Szabo’s work, that Szabo deliberately post-dated his bit gold articles to look posterior to bitcoin shortly after the announcement of bitcoin.  Grey states that only 0.1% of cryptography researchers could have produced the text.  Aston University appears confident  Aston University students and Dr Grieve appear to be quite confident in their findings. Dr Grieve raised a few questions that we also raised by Grey:  “The case looks pretty clear-cut. Szabo is an expert in law, finance, cryptography and computer science. He created ‘bit gold’, a precursor to bitcoin, and was looking for collaborators in 2008. Did Nick Szabo create bitcoin? We’re not sure, but we think he probably wrote the paper so it’s certainly worth a closer look.”  The last sentence is particularly interesting. The fact that Szabo authored or co-authored the paper does not mean he created bitcoin alone. The fact that Szabo may have been involved does not mean he developed the protocol or produced the entire paper.  One theory many bitcoin enthusiasts are familiar with is that Satoshi Nakamoto is merely a pseudonym for a group of developers. But why would Szabo effectively ghost-write the paper for someone else?  Unlike most cryptographers out there, Szabo has a background in law. He was a law professor at George Washington University and he coined the phrase 'smart contracts'. Szabo is also a blogger and an expert in the field of digital contracts and digital currency.  As Dr Grieve and Grey concluded, there is a good chance the document was co-authored by a group of developers. If this was the case, Szabo would have been the perfect candidate to make sense of it, edit it and prepare it for publishing.  Although circumstantial evidence is starting to add up, the realm of speculation has its pitfalls: identifying the real Satoshi was never going to be easy.  Newsweek learned this lesson the hard way when it named Dorian S Nakamoto as the creator of bitcoin. Even before Newsweek's report, there were various media outlets and individuals investigating more than a dozen different candidates, or suspects.  However, identifying the real Satoshi proved to be an elusive goal.

42377162,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zDsX,1397647463,Video: Inside the Offshore Vault Where Gold Trades for Bitcoin,"On the tiny and semi-independent island of Guernsey there is a new type of bitcoin exchange, one that trades 'digital gold’ for the real thing.  Around 60,000 people live there, around 70 miles off the south coast of England. Although closely linked to the United Kingdom, its direct relationship with the Crown, instead of the government, means that it is virtually autonomous, particularly with regards to financial issues and tax.  The island is home to Bullion Bitcoinhttps://bullionbitcoin.com/, a unique exchange that trades bitcoin for physical gold. Launched earlier this year, the company says it wants to aid the easy transmission of gold while providing a solid store of value for bitcoin.

42377153,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zDfx,1397645240,Mt. Gox Officially Files for Liquidation,"Mt. Gox today filed for liquidation in a Tokyo court, abandoning its plans for civil rehabilitation and giving its creditors even less hope of recouping their losses, according to a Wall Street Journal report.  The filing is one step further than the bankruptcy protection the failed bitcoin exchange had applied for on 28th February. The difficulty of the procedure was cited as a reason, together with dwindling hopes of a resurrection.  The filing document, posted on Mt. Gox's website, said:    ""During the following 1 month and a half, an investigation has proceeded with regard to the past factual elements related to the disappearance of bitcoins and missing funds which were the cause of said application, but it is expected that said investigation will still require some time and at this time, there are no prospects for the restart of the business.      Further, MtGox Co., Ltd. is continuing the negotiations with sponsor candidates but the concrete selection process has not yet started.""    Inconvenience  ""The dismissal of the application for commencement of a civil rehabilitation procedure will create great inconvenience and concerns to our creditors for which we apologize,"" the document concluded.  If approved, a trustee will take control of Mt. Gox's remaining assets from CEO Mark Karpeles. The news was hardly unexpected, but may still surprise some who had remained hopeful of a rescue and partial restoration as recently as yesterday.  Mt. Gox confirmed it had recovered 200,000 BTC in 'old format' wallets a month ago, but has not made any more progress towards finding the rest of the 850,000 it declared were missing in its 28th February Japanese bankruptcy filing. It also claimed $63.6m in debts.  Further US action  Today's liquidation application could be related to Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles' reluctance to travel to the US, either to testify in the class action against his company or further defend its case for bankruptcy protection.  Though he has not been charged with any criminal offence in the US or his current home country of Japan, Karpeles was reportedly concerned he might be detained in the US as part of investigations into Mt. Gox's collapse and even its prior connections to users of the Silk Road Marketplace.  The latter issue has already seen the two-month house arrest and indictment of Charlie Shrem, who ran another of bitcoin's early exchanges, Bitinstant.  The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) seized a total $5m last year from accounts belonging to Mt. Gox's US subsidiary Mutum Sigillum LLC, over that company's failure to register with FinCEN as a money transmitter.  According to Karpeles, the DHS still holds the funds. The two separate seizures were often given as a reason for Mt. Gox's constant US dollar withdrawal delays, which continued right up until it ceased operations in February this year.  The WSJ reported that, although the DHS said it does not have any ongoing discussions with anyone from Mt. Gox, one of its investigators was still attempting to contact one of Mt. Gox's former employees in Japan in March.

42377136,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zBU5,1397636027,Coinfloor to Become First 'Publicly Auditable' Bitcoin Exchange,"UK-based bitcoin exchange Coinfloor announced a slew of new updates today, including an over-the-counter (OTC) market for large, institutional bitcoin traders and a ""proof of solvency"" audit process.  Coinfloor is now also offering 0% commission for all clients for 60 days. The service updates notably follow the exchange's re-opening of user registration on 27th March, which had been delayed since November.  Perhaps most notable of the announcements was the opening of the OTC market, which Coinfloor suggested would pave the way for institutional investors to begin exploring bitcoin.  Said Coinfloor CEO Mark Lamb:  ""In speaking to a number of equities exchanges, we found the appetite for new products remarkably positive. Brokers, proprietary traders and the rest of the financial community are curious and excited about the opportunities that Bitcoin presents.""  The announcement is notable as it indicates that a similar strategy to the one pioneered by SecondMarket and Bitcoin Investment Trust CEO Barry Silbert is also finding success overseas. Silbert discussed his vision for opening up bitcoin investing to the general public widely earlier this year, and his plan involved finding an acting market maker and using an OTC exchange.  Lamb indicated that Coinfloor has also partnered with a regulated firm to provide this support.  Emphasizing liquidity  Speaking broadly about the past failures of bitcoin exchanges, Coinfloor discussed that auditing is necessary, as bitcoin businesses are essentially third parties that must be granted trust.  Part of this process will be making Coinfloor ""publicly auditable"", thereby allowing users to validate the company's records and compare them to the bitcoin ledger.  Read the announcement:  ""For the first time, the company will permit access to its books to reassure users that client funds are safe – and that the company is not only solvent but wholly reliable as a trusted partner.""  OTC markets and 0% commissions  First unveiled during France's TradeTech conference last week, Coinfloor said its OTC market aims to bring added liquidity to its exchange.  Further, it urged others in the industry to follow its lead, explaining:  ""With a market cap greater than $5bn, but a 24-hour global trade volume of less than $100m, bitcoin markets need to make concerted efforts to facilitate a much higher level of liquidity in order for the currency to succeed.""  Coinfloor also reduced trade commissions for a limited time, revealing it will waive all trade commissions to all interested parties through 15th June.  Bitcoin in the UK  To date, Coinfloor is the only UK-based bitcoin exchange, though others are reported to be in development.  Still, despite being the new home of the Bitcoin Foundation, the UK has struggled somewhat to build a strong community of bitcoin businesses, though notable projects include ZipZap and a real-time bitcoin price tag.  One factor for this was the 20% value-added tax (VAT) formerly imposed by the HMRC, the UK's tax authority, on all trading. This VAT was later removed with help from members of what would later become the UK Digital Currency Association, which officially launched on 24th March.
