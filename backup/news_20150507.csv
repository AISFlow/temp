Based in Mexico, Entrepids specializes in helping businesses establish an omnichannel e-commerce presence, offering Google Analytics integration, website design and support and training to regional clients including US electronics giant Best Buy Mexico and upscale Mexican department store chain El Palacio de Hierro.  BitPagos  CEO Sebastian Serrano indicated that, as part of the partnership, Entrepids will play a role in helping encourage its merchants to sign up for its service.  Serrano told CoinDesk:  ""From this point, the next phase is to go after these larger clients to integrate our platform into their system, but this makes it very, very easy. We have done the big part of all the technology integration so it's going to be super easy for clients to add bitcoin payments.""  Serrano acknowledged that while the Entrepids partnership marks his firm's first major technology provider partnership, such a path seems to be a larger focus for US-based processors, which have integrated with platforms like CardinalCommerce and Shopify.  Serrano went on to explain that BitPagos intends to take a balanced approach, one that targets both small merchants as well as larger online retailers in Latin America.  ""It's important to push for bitcoin in these kinds of deals so that we start having an impact on overall e-commerce. But, we need people to be able to pay the local restaurant and taxi driver, too,"" he said.

42398354,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTJNh,1431023444,Connecticut Bill Seeks Additional Requirements for Bitcoin MSBs,"The Connecticut House of Representatives has passed a bill that would give the state's top financial regulator new powers to oversee parts of the local digital currency industry.  If signed into law, Substitute House Bill No. 6800 would require a company seeking a money transmission license from the Connecticut Banking Department to specify that it plans to offer digital currency services. State regulators would then be empowered to assess whether or not to reject that applicant’s request based on the potential risks to consumers.  The bill states:  “The bill allows the commissioner to deny a money transmission license to an otherwise qualified applicant who will or may engage in business involving virtual currency if the commissioner believes it would be an undue risk of financial loss to consumers, considering the applicant's proposed business model.”  Passed unanimously in the House on 6th May, the bill now moves to the Senate for approval. If approved and signed by Connecticut Governor Dannel P Malloy, the bill would also put in place new laws regarding payday loans, mortgages and consumer credit reporting.  Different bond requirements  The proposed law outlines how license applicants may face additional hurdles should they opt to serve the digital currency market.  “The bill allows the commissioner to place additional requirements, restrictions, or conditions on the license of an applicant involved with virtual currency,” the bill states.  These stipulations could include “different surety bond requirements than ordinarily apply to money transmitters”. The bond posted by a company seeking a money transmission license would have to reflect the price fluctuations in the digital currency market, according to the bill, which reads:  “For applicants and licensees who will or may engage in the business of transmitting monetary value in the form of virtual currency, such bond shall be in a principal sum as determined by the commissioner and shall be calculated reasonably to address the current and prospective volatility of the market in such currency or currencies.”  The proposed law also identifies ‘virtual currencies’ as digital units of exchange in both centralized and decentralized systems. Units used exclusively for gambling and consumer reward points that cannot be redeemed for fiat currencies would not fall under this definition.

42398364,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTJWY,1431019838,Swedish Digital Currency Exchange Cryex Raises $10 Million,"Sweden-based digital currency exchange Cryex has raised $10m from investors including White Star Capital and Northzone Ventures.  According to its website, launched 4th May, the Stockholm-based company seeks to bridge the gap between traditional financial markets and blockchain technology with a soon-to-be launched exchange product.  Though details are scarce, this general focus was further addressed by Simon Nathanson, chairman of Cryex Clearing AB, in statements regarding the round.  Nathanson said:  “Cryex has a unique model to clearing and settlement and has all the necessary components in place; financial-grade architecture and technology partners, a seasoned team and a number of high-profile strategic investors from the financial sector.”  Eric Martineau-Fortin, managing partner at White Star Capital, voiced his enthusiasm for the company's coming market entrance, which he said he hopes will attract ""financial institutions into the digital currency ecosystem"".  A company statement indicated Cryex has filed a regulation application with the Swedish Finansinspektionen (SFSA), Sweden's government agency responsible for regulation and overseeing the country's financial market.  Notably, Northzone Ventures has previously invested in mobile payments firm iZettle, though neither it nor White Star Capital has a history of financial technology investments.  The SFSA did not respond to requests for comment at the time of press.

42398335,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTIEr,1431010812,"ItBit Nets $25 Million, Launches NYDFS-Approved Bitcoin Exchange","New York bitcoin exchange itBit has closed $25m in Series A fundraising.  The round drew support from a pool of new and existing sources including RRE Ventures, Liberty City Ventures and investor Jay W Jordan II. Raptor Capital Management chairman James Pallotta also participated in the round.  ItBit  further confirmed the addition of three new members to its board of directors: former Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation chairperson Sheila Bair; former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley; and former Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) chairman Robert Herz.  The three directors had previously been tied to itBit through its banking license application filed in February, though last month the company declined to confirm their participation.  Perhaps most notably, however, itBit revealed that it has received a trust company charter from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). According to separate statements from the NYDFS, itBit is the first company of its kind to receive a trust company charter.  In a statement, itBit co-founder and CEO Charles Cascarilla said that the approval gives the bitcoin exchange broad access to US-based customers, adding:  ""Regulatory approval from the NYDFS allows us to serve as a custodian for our clients' assets and expand our services to US customers – the largest market of bitcoin traders in the world – and allows us to do so with the highest standard of care afforded by any bitcoin company.""  ItBit said that customer funds denominated in US dollars will be held in FDIC-insured accounts, though the company declined to name its banking partner.  Charter review complete  In its own remarks, the NYDFS revealed itBit applied for a charter under the agency's digital currency business process in February of this year, after which it was subjected to what it characterized as a ""rigorous review"" of its compliance and cybersecurity standards.  As a result, itBit has emerged as one of the more well-regulated US bitcoin exchanges, a point also emphasized by the agency.  The NYDFS explained:  ""As a chartered limited purpose trust company with fiduciary powers under the banking law, itBit can begin operating immediately and is subject to ongoing supervision by the NYDFS.""  Superintendent Benjamin M Lawsky remarked in a statement that bitcoin and similar implementations ""could ultimately hold real promise"" as financial technologies, but echoed past comments by stating that regulations are needed to protect customers.  All-star board  The addition of Bair, Bradley and Herz grants itBit added financial and political heft as it looks to grow its market share in the budding US bitcoin market.  Bradley, for example, previously acted as New Jersey Senator from 1979 to 1997 – serving on the Senate Finance Committee – and later ran for president during the 2000 Democratic primaries.  In a statement, Bradley voiced his support for bitcoin, starting: ""Bitcoin has the potential to transform the world of finance as we know it today.""  Bair served as FDIC chair from 2006 to 2011, a period that included the 2008 financial panic and subsequent economic crisis. She has since served on the board for several companies and organizations, such as Spanish banking giant Banco Santander which she joined in 2014.  Herz, a former partner for PricewaterhouseCooper, was appointed FASB chair in 2002.

42398325,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTI42,1430997578,Isle of Man Trials First Government-Run Blockchain Project,"UPDATE (7th May 18:52 BST): Comment added from Brian Donegan, head of operations for digital development and e-business at the Department of Economic Development and Nick Williamson, CEO of Pythia.      The Isle of Man's Department of Economic Development today announced plans to trial the first government-run blockchain project.  Using proof-of-stake protocol Credits, developed by local startup Pythia, the department will create a registry of digital currency companies operating on the island.  Brian Donegan, head of operations for digital development and e-business at the Department of Economic Developmenthttps://www.gov.im/about-the-government/departments/economic-development/, told CoinDesk the project marked a step towards the use of blockchain technology within government, though he stressed it remained an ""experimental technical trial"".  ""What we’re actually looking at is a major initiative on the back of the work the Isle of Man has been doing around cryptocurrencies ... We’re the first to do this but we’ll be assessing it as we go.""  Crypto-businesses who come to the island will still require approval from the Financial Supervision Commission, the department’s regulator.  However, Donegan said it was ""entirely possible"" the Commission would implement a trial of its own.  ""We would anticipate that at a later date that the Financial Supervision Commission will do their own dedicated register ... it’s entirely possible they might want to have their own blockchain.""  Credits  Nick Williamson, CEO of Pythia, the startup behind Credits, told CoinDesk the move highlighted the ""wider use"" of blockchain technology outside digital currencies. He added:  ""There has been a lot of talk over the past four to five years about such a thing being able to happen in the future, but we need to show the potential and show it can be a frictionless endeavour. I think this a good first step.""  The Department for Economic Development will use a customised proof-of-stake model on the Credits protocol to secure its registry.  Williamson explained the network will be manned by three ""validating"" nodes within the department, though anyone can download its client.  ""Whenever any two of those nodes agree on a block, then that block will be part of the blockchain. Anybody who connects to the network can audit and download the blockchain. It will be interesting to see how many do connect once it's up and running,"" he said.  The benefit of using Credit's consensus model, against bitcoin's proof-of-work for example, is that you ""only pay for the transactions that actually happen"", rather than the upkeep of the network, Williamson added.  Regulation  Including Pythia, there are 25 digital currency businesses currently based on the Isle of Man.  April saw the introduction of anti-money laundering (AML) laws that require all these firms to collect ID information and report suspicious activity to authorities.  The Financial Supervision Commission will oversee AML matters after the legislation receives Royal Assent in the UK, which Donegan hopes to happen ""in the next couple of months"".  He added:  ""The Isle of Man is adamant in its forthcoming regulations that it wants to protect the consumer and keep crime out. It's very keen to use as many mechanisms, tests and technical trials that will assist that long-term objective.""  While murmurs of government involvement in Central America and Hong Kong have surfaced, the Isle of Man is the first nation to pin its colours to bitcoin’s mast.  The Department of Economic Development's trial is set to start privately next week, with a public release expected later this month.
