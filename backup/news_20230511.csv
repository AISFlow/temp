Justin Sun Eying Meme Coins In a tweet on May 11, Sun, known for being a crypto whale, actively holding and transferring colossal sums of coins in the past, said he would begin actively trading meme coins and promising projects straight from his public cryptocurrency address. However, as a disclaimer, all profits will be donated to charity. I've decided to begin actively trading meme coins and promising projects through my public address. Please note, I will personally bear all potential losses from these trades, and any profits made will be donated entirely to charity. — H.E. Justin Sun 孙宇晨 (@justinsuntron) May 11, 2023 He also added that though he might decide to buy certain coins and get exposure to a promising meme coin project, the said coin or project, regardless of its potential, may not be listed on Huobi or Poloniex. These are some of the early and most liquid cryptocurrency exchanges listing hundreds of tokens that Sun occupies an influential executive seat. Related Reading: Why Justin Sun’s Stablecoin USDD Is Struggling To Maintain Its Dollar Peg It is still unclear which project Sun has an eye on. At the same time, it could not be determined which of his crypto addresses the co-founder will use when trading meme coins. Although Sun might be the co-founder of Tron, he has not shied from engaging in other projects deployed on public networks like Ethereum and others. Tron Co-founder Warned By Binance Following a warning from Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, the world’s largest exchange by client count and trading volumes, Sun reversed a $56 million transfer he had made in early May. There were concerns that Sun was planning a token grab of SUI, the native currency of the Sui Network. Our team told Justin, if he uses any of these to grab the LaunchPool Sui token, we will ""take action against it"". SMH. Binance LaunchPool are meant as air drops for our retail users, not just for a few whales. On the bright side, blockchains are transparent… https://t.co/8Xs1oXjfVd — CZ 🔶 Binance (@cz_binance) May 1, 2023 WhaleAlert flagged Sun’s bulk $56 million transfer in TUSD. Before Zhao said, Binance would take action if he block-bought SUI from the Binance Launchpool. The exchange clarified that it wanted a fair airdrop to include active retailers and not “just a few crypto whales.” Through the Launchpool, users can stake their crypto assets like SUI, providing liquidity, before receiving staking rewards. Sun later apologized for the huge transfer, saying it was in error. The real intention, he clarified, was in the market-making of TUSD, a stablecoin. The Tron founder said: Regrettably, some of our team members were not fully aware of the intended purpose for these funds and inadvertently used a portion of them to participate in exchange campaigns. Upon realizing this error, we immediately contacted the exchange team and arranged for a full refund of the funds. Related Reading: TRX Surges Over 600% Following Justin Sun’s Deal With FTX It is not immediately clear how Sun will proceed in trading and how the community will react to his purchases once he starts picking out worthy meme coin projects. Even so, what’s clear is that his addresses, like those of other influential crypto founders like Ethereum’s co-founder Vitalik Buterin, will be actively tracked and copied.

Milady is the latest entrant in this space, and its self-organized meme coin, LADYS, is based on an anime avatar non-fungible token (NFT) collection. In just 24 hours, the value of Milady’s LADYS coin surged by an astonishing 5,250% and reached a trading price of $0.0000001528. Related Reading: Winner Takes All: Bitcoin And DXY Compete For Global Financial Dominance Milady Crypto Holders Beware? However, The surge in the value of Milady’s LADYS coin has been accompanied by a concerning rumor. It has been suggested that wallets holding Milady coins will be placed on the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) blacklist. This list maintained by the US Treasury Department identifies individuals and organizations subject to economic sanctions and other restrictions. The reasons behind this rumor are unclear, and it is important to note that any official sources have not confirmed it. However, such a move by the US government could have serious implications for anyone holding Milady coins. Being placed on the OFAC blacklist could make it difficult for individuals to conduct financial transactions or access certain services. It is unclear why such sanctions would target Milady. While using cryptocurrencies for illicit purposes has been a concern for regulators, there is no evidence to suggest that Milady or its LADYS coin is being used for anything illegal. Additionally, the idea that wallets holding a particular cryptocurrency would be targeted for sanctions is unusual. Despite the concerning rumor that wallets holding Milady coins may be placed on the OFAC blacklist, the cryptocurrency continues to experience a powerful uptrend and post significant gains. Milady’s LADYS coin has surged by over 71.5% within the last 24 hours. Despite the rumors, this remarkable growth indicates that investors and traders still show confidence in the cryptocurrency. Will LADYS Coin Follow The Footsteps Of DOGE And SHIBA INU For 100x Growth? In the world of cryptocurrency, the rise of meme-based coins has been nothing short of phenomenal. Coins like DOGE and SHIBA INU have skyrocketed in value, delivering massive returns to early investors. Some wonder whether Milady’s LADYS coin could be the next big thing in the meme coin world. According to Crypto Koryo, a popular cryptocurrency analyst, Milady’s LADYS coin has followed the same formula as other successful meme coins. The project’s Twitter and Telegram accounts were created on May 6th, and just two days later, the LADYS token went live. On the same day, the project posted its first tweet. However, what caught Crypto Koryo’s attention was that Milady’s team quickly reached out to several big influencers on Twitter. These influencers, including GevCrypto, AlmiraCrypto, and GiveAwayHost, have a combined following of over 2 million people. While these followers may be fake or bought, they are still enough to give Milady’s LADYS coin visibility and exposure to a large audience. The success of meme coins like DOGE and SHIBA INU has shown that social media hype and speculation can drive massive price increases quickly. However, as Crypto Koryo points out, the future of Milady’s LADYS coin is far from certain. While the coin has grown significantly, it could just as easily crash and burn depending on various factors. Compared to its nearest competitor PEPE coin, LADYS coin is currently leading the meme coin frenzy. While Milady’s LADYS has experienced significant growth, PEPE coin has suffered a decline of over 28% since yesterday.

42420447,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpwHF,1683840248,Bitcoin Prices Retrace as Traders With Varying Time Horizons Jockey for Position,"Bitcoin prices tumbled in Thursday trading, as markets seemed to discount the sort of encouraging inflation and employment data that has juiced prices repeatedly in recent months.  For now, investors seem more concerned about banking and other macroeconomic uncertainties.  On Thursday Producer prices (PPI) rose 0.2% month-over-month, beating consensus expectations of a 0.3% increase. Initial jobless claims in the U.S. rose to 264,000 for the week ending May 6, the highest since October, and surpassing expectations of 245,000.  In the current economic environment, weaker jobs data has generally been a boon for risk-on asset prices, suggesting that the hot jobs market is cooling and that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) may be able to end its hotly criticized streak of interest rate hikes. Concerns about high employment as a stimulus for strong economic growth and inflation have at times weighed heavily on asset markets  Despite this seemingly positive economic news, short-term sentiment in crypto markets has shown signs of uncertainty.  CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Trend Indicator has moved from “uptrend” to “neutral” as bullish sentiment has begun to wane. Part of BTI’s methodology involves the comparison of moving averages (MA), and their proximity to each other, specifically as one crosses above or below the other.  For instance, BTC’s recent price action shows that its two-day moving average has crossed below the 10-day moving average. The same holds true for BTC’s five- and 20-day moving averages, highlighting the recent downtrend in bitcoin markets. This development has contributed to the indicator’s shift to neutral.  The downtrend coincides with an uptick in short-term holders in losing positions sending coins to exchanges.  Rising coin flows to exchanges are usually bearish, as they suggest investors are looking to liquidate the assets. Short-term means that investors have held their BTC for less than 155 days.  Short-term bitcoin holders have transferred 14,800 BTC to exchanges, while long-term holders have sent 523. Meanwhile, the volume of BTC sent to exchanges by long-term holders in losing positions has declined.  As is often the case, the sentiment of investors with shorter and longer term horizons have diverged. At the moment, the bearish sentiment of short-term holders appears to be driving the overall market narrative.  The other group worth monitoring, however, is whales (i.e. unique entities holding more than 1,000 BTC).  In the aggregate, whales are removing coins from exchanges. This trend suggests bullishness. However, among whales with at least 100,000 bitcoin, their overall supply increased 2.5% between March and May, but has been declining since May 1.  All told, the recent combination of factors has increased uncertainty in markets. While long- term holders appear to have strong conviction, the activity of short-term holders warrants monitoring, particularly those with large overall positions.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/11/bitcoin-prices-retrace-as-traders-with-varying-time-horizons-jockey-for-position,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/db4898fd5b4fe240959b2076a0b58bdd5b94df70-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

He will act as the chief technology officer (CTO) of Twitter. Elon Musk Stepping Down As Twitter CEO In a Tweet on late May 11, the technology billionaire said Twitter has since hired a CEO whom she will take over in six weeks. Excited to announce that I’ve hired a new CEO for X/Twitter. She will be starting in ~6 weeks! My role will transition to being exec chair & CTO, overseeing product, software & sysops. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 11, 2023 Meanwhile, DOGE, like the rest of the crypto market, is down 32% from its April 2023 peak and likely to slide even lower following this announcement. Related Reading: Dogecoin Limps In A Bearish Market: What Traders Should Watch Out For Musk is an ardent supporter of cryptocurrencies and has specifically expressed his admiration for DOGE, the meme token. In numerous instances, DOGE prices have rallied following comments from Musk, mostly posted on Twitter. Like most meme coins, some argue that DOGE has no fundamental value, with supporters keen on riding the coin’s bullish and bearish cycles. During the last bull cycle, DOGE rallied to over $0.70, peaking when Elon Musk appeared on Saturday Night Live (SNL) show saying he was the “Doge master.” Over the past few months, DOGE has crashed by over 85%, slumping to $0.05 in Q4 2022. However, this didn’t prevent Elon Musk from tweeting about the project. In April, DOGE prices rocketed when Twitter, the company Musk presently leads, temporarily changed its logo to the Shiba Inu dog associated with the meme project. In response, DOGE spiked, adding as much as $4 billion, surging from around $0.07 to $0.10. Musk said he delivered on his promise by temporarily replacing the blue bird logo representing Twitter with Shiba Inu.

42420440,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpw8z,1683838830,Bitcoin Edges Below $27K as Latest Bank Crisis Fails to Trigger Price Increase,"Bitcoin (BTC) edged below $27,000 as the latest banking debacle failed to trigger the sort of price surge that has occurred in recent weeks amid multiple U.S. bank failures.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at around $26,950, down over 3% in the past 24 hours. BTC had been hovering above $27,000 Thursday morning before dropping below the threshold around 1 p.m. ET. BTC has been trending downward for much of the past week as investors look for a new price catalyst. Bitcoin fell below $27,000 on Wednesday for the first time since March, regained the threshold before falling again.  In an email to CoinDesk, Vineeth Bhuvanagiri, the managing director of Emurgo Fintech, the founding entity of the Cardano blockchain, noted that investors remain concerned about low liquidity, which is why “seemingly slight selloffs tend to have an outsize impact on price.”  Meanwhile, an outflow of deposits at PacWest Bancorp (PACW) that sent the Los Angeles-based bank’s stock price down 22% on Thursday did not spur “strong demand for cryptos as this time, Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange Oanda, wrote in a Thursday note.  “Banking contagion fears still remain low as some banks like Western Alliance show deposits are rising,” Moya said.  Emurgo’s Bhuvanagir suggested that a major macro shock such as “a lack of resolution on the debt ceiling that triggers a default” could send bitcoin’s price reeling, although he added that BTC appears to be “in an accumulation phase, meaning that “dips get gobbled up quickly.”  In an interview with CoinDesk, Greg Cipolaro, global head of research at bitcoin-focused investment firm NYDIG, compared the market’s tenor to that during the debt ceiling crisis of 2011, “sensing a little bit of the same,” Cipolaro said.  “It's a little bit of calm before the storm right now,” he said. “As we get into the negotiations in the end, the ceiling will ultimately be raised. There may be quite a bit of market volatility around that.”  “It might be that bitcoin, as a non-sovereign issued store of value, is seen as a valid investment option for those seeking to insulate themselves from the machinations of politicians and monetary policy setters,” he wrote in a note published on April 21.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, followed a similar trend, dropping over 3.5% to hover around $1,788 Thursday. ETH dropped below $1,800 for the first time since late April, according to CoinDesk data. Layer 2 blockchain Polygon’s MATIC token slid over 4% to trade at around $.84 cents.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which measures the overall crypto market’s performance, was down 3.7% for the day.  Equity markets were mixed, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropping by 0.1% and 0.6%, respectively. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was up 0.1% for the day.

12545175,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=531306,1683835746,Cardano May Sink To This Level As Bears Keep Gaining Leverage,"Over the past few days, the price of Cardano has been in a downward trend. This has led to the strengthening of bearish sentiment. In the last 24 hours, ADA experienced a dip of approximately 4.2%. Over the past week, the altcoin depreciated by close to 10%. These price fluctuations have raised concerns about investors’ interest in Cardano. The same is reflected in the low buying strength and accumulation observed on the charts. Cardano finds itself trapped within a range, lacking a clear price direction, gradually eroding buyer confidence. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rebounds From $27,100 After Spike In Bearish Sentiment The bears have gained strength, causing an important support level to be breached and subsequently transforming into a resistance level for the altcoin. For Cardano to regain its previous price ceiling, buyers must reenter the market. Furthermore, the broader market conditions, including Bitcoin’s consolidation around the $27,000 zone, have prevented many major altcoins, including Cardano, from surpassing their immediate resistance levels. For ADA to overcome its nearest resistance, it relies heavily on the market’s overall strength. There has been a decline in market capitalization, further emphasizing the increase in selling strength. Cardano Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, the price of ADA stood at $0.35, and it is approaching a significant local support level that has played a crucial role in the past. The closest support line is $0.34, while the overhead price ceiling is $0.36. The altcoin’s ability to reclaim the resistance level largely depends on the bulls’ ability to defend the price above the immediate support level. If the current level experiences a decline, the coin is likely to first drop to $0.34, and if the selling pressure persists, it may further decline to $0.33. It’s worth noting that the volume of Cardano traded during the last session has decreased, indicating a decline in buying strength. Technical Analysis Since ADA dropped below the $0.38 price level, its buying strength has failed to rebound. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is below the 40-mark, indicating that ADA is nearing oversold territory on the daily chart. Furthermore, the asset’s price has fallen below the 20-Simple Moving Average line, which suggests that sellers have taken control of the market’s price momentum. ADA has generated sell signals based on various indicators, suggesting a possible decline in price. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, which reveals price momentum and reversals, displayed red histograms associated with sell signals for the altcoin. Furthermore, the Directional Movement Index (DMI), responsible for indicating price direction, showed a negative trend with the -DI line (orange) positioned above the +DI line (blue). This implies a bearish sentiment in the market.

Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee that oversees the SEC, sent a letter this week to SEC Chair Gary Gensler complaining that an earlier April 26 request had been rebuffed. The letters, also signed by Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.), coincided with recent hearings – including one on May 10 – in which Republican lawmakers criticized the agency for trying to hold the crypto industry to existing securities regulations.  “While you have stated that digital asset intermediaries such as exchanges should ‘come in and register,’ you have refused to establish rules with which digital asset trading platforms and other intermediaries can comply,” the lawmakers wrote in the April letter, which asked for a list of companies that have met with SEC officials to discuss registration.  McHenry’s committee will likely be instrumental in any legislation that may emerge this year on the U.S. oversight of digital assets, and a draft resolution the committee published this week suggests that the SEC has been doing an inadequate job and needs to await direction from Congress.  “Chair Gensler will respond to members of Congress directly, rather than through the media,” an agency spokesperson said.  The May 9 follow-up letter from McHenry and Huizenga noted that SEC staff complained of ""how overly burdensome the committee's requests have been."" The lawmakers narrowed this request and others, offering a new deadline of May 19.

12543639,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4603203-cipher-dont-look-up?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1683831534,Cipher: Don't Look Up,"Summary Cipher has a fast-growing, low-cost mining operation that it believes is the best-in-class. More than 80% of its capacity is in one site that has particularly low electricity prices, which might make it the most profitable Bitcoin mining operation in the US. With only 28 employees and a small management team, it is focused and dedicated to their plans. Cipher's competitive advantage is also its biggest threat; if it loses it, it could lose everything. Cipher Mining Inc. ( CIFR ) is building mining capacity at an impressive rate; it has signed an outstanding Power Purchase Agreement ((PPA)) with Luminant that gives it a competitive advantage over all the miners I follow except Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) and guarantees a profitable Bitcoin (BTC-USD) operation at all Bitcoin prices for the last three years. The PPA has the flexibility to allow Cipher to sell the electricity purchased under the agreement back to the grid when the cost of electricity makes that more profitable than mining Bitcoin. Last quarter selling electricity, it added $150k in profits to the bottom line. Cipher has signed an equally impressive deal with Canaan (CAN) for 11,000 new miners that will be energized in Q3 and implied in the recent earnings call that this is part of an extended agreement giving Cipher preferential purchase prices and payment terms. Management is delivering growth while minimizing debt and dilution, trying to build a true industry leader. Listening to the recent earnings call, it was clear that they believe they are already industry leaders and are pursuing the right path. They do not see any hurdles and are pressing on with energy and speed. They have their heads down, working hard, following the plan. If they look up, they might see some negatives on the horizon, potentially severely disrupting their plans. This is the third article I have written on Bitcoin miners in recent weeks. They have experienced a boom in price that started in December and continues. Initially, Cipher was leading the pack, but as you can see from the dashboard below, they have more recently fallen back. This article will explain the reason for the initial growth and present an argument for the slowdown. Mining Companies Performance (May 10th) (Author Database) In the latest earnings call , I was looking for information about two things (Q1 2023, May 9th) How is the capacity build-up going? What is happening with the Luminant legal case? Cipher Capacity Build Cipher is growing fast; they are doing a great job (slide 7 of the Q1 2023 earnings call presentation ) Cipher capacity (Q1 2023 earnings) 7.2EH/s makes Cipher a real player in this market. Riot Platforms quotes a current figure of 9.8 and a target of 11. I listened with interest to hear how well the build-out was going; I heard the management say ""best in class"" enough times for me to start counting when they said it. I was impressed by the quoted Bitcoin mining performance, 45 in two days (May 7 th and 8 th ), and by the low-cost production and energy prices paid. The purchase of 11,000 mining rigs from Canaan was intriguing, and I liked how operations were funded by selling Bitcoin mined. However, they did not mention, nor were they asked about, a legal case that could potentially bring this particular company down. Cipher is in dispute with Luminant Luminant, a subsidiary of Vistra Energy ( VST ), provides electricity to Odessa, one of Cipher's 4 mining sites. The electricity is supplied through a Power Purchase Agreement that is an excellent deal for Cipher. It provides very low-cost energy and allows Cipher to sell energy back to the grid when the price of electricity is higher than the value of Bitcoins mined. Cipher management believes it gives them a significant competitive advantage over their competitors. From the research I have done, they are probably right. The PPA has delivered an average cost per kWh of 2.7c ( slide 3 of earnings call presentation) compared with Riot at 2.9 c and Hut 8 Mining Corp. ( HUT ) at 3.4c. Of the 16 miners I track, 9 publish their energy cost, and these are the three lowest figures. The Odessa site is crucial to the success of Cipher. They have four mines; Odessa is wholly owned, and they have a JV in which they are a minority shareholder in the other three. Cipher Mining Sites (Q1 2023 Slides) In the earnings call, we heard the Odessa site (based in Texas) has continued its build-out and reached 5.0 EH/s capacity, meaning Odessa represents 84% of Cipher's mining capacity. Cipher own 49% of their other locations as part of a JV with WindHQ. In the earnings call, we heard that Cipher ordered 11,000 more miners for Odessa and expects to have them installed by Q3. Management did not mention the legal dispute with Luminant in the Q1 earnings call. The FY 2022 report ( from P60 10K 2022 ) described the issue as not material. In my view, it is potentially very material. Luminant legal case (FY 2022 10K notes) In this case, Luminant is asking for the repayment of $6.7 million they claim was paid to Cipher in error. Cipher said in the FY 2022 report We wholly dispute the claims made by Luminant and we intend to contest the case vigorously The industry has a precedent case, which is the cause of my concern. Hut 8 encountered a similar problem with the electricity supplier to one of its sites supplied by Devon Energy ( DVN ) subsidiary Vista. (I covered the case in my recent article ( The Bitcoin Miners Are Flying, But Where Is Hut 8 Going? ). Hut also contested the claim vigorously; in the end, Vista turned off the electricity supply! The case has still not been resolved, but the entire site remains without electricity, and the nearly 8,000 mining rigs that should be running are in storage. Hut does not expect to be able to re-energize the area and is looking for new homes for the miners (and a new PPA to provide power). If Luminant cuts the power, as happened to Hut, Cipher will lose 84% of its mining capacity as well as the PPA, the source of its competitive advantage, valued on the balance sheet at $71 million ( Derivative line items slide 13 ), and it could be in going concern territory. Luminant has not paid the money due to Cipher under the PPA (page 60, item 3 10k FY 2022 ) which implies they take the dispute far more seriously and have the right to terminate this contract. (page 4 FY 2022 10K ) The agreement also provides for certain curtailment events pursuant to which Luminant has a right to curtail the electrical power delivered in each contractual year. Subject to certain early termination exceptions, the agreement provides for a subsequent automatic annual renewal, unless either party provides written notice to the other party of its intent to terminate the agreement at least six months prior to the expiration of then current term The risk seems overwhelming, and management reported it as not a material issue. Having over 80% of their mining rigs in a single site in Texas presents another issue. In December 2022, a storm in Texas damaged a building and took 17,000 Riot Platforms mining rigs offline. Riot, the market leader and operator of multiple sites, has sufficient capacity to cope with this level of disturbance; I am not sure that is true of Cipher. Cipher bought 11,000 miners from Canaan. Cipher said in the earnings call that the 11,000 miners are the lowest cost and best payment conditions they have ever had; they also said it was the best deal they have ever heard of in the industry! In the call, we heard how the CEO had taken a multiple-week trip to Asia, to build a better relationship with one of the miner manufacturers. They mentioned having discussions with Bitmain , MicroBT, and Canaan. The CEO discussed the sales pitch they presented; Cipher believes that as a market leader, it has superior finances and the ability to be a leading long-term customer. Canaan is the less well-known of the three. Its Avalon mining rig has a reputation for working well in high temperatures (useful for Texas) and is known to be reliable. It is not considered as powerful or profitable as Bitmain's Antminer or MicroBT's WhatsMiner . It is challenging to get precise information on the mining profitability of the different miners as it is a source of competitive advantage for miners and manufacturers As far as I know, the two actual market-leading miners (in terms of capex) Riot and Marathon Digital Holdings ( MARA ) are not following Cipher and buying from Canaan. They are buying from Bitmain and MicroBT. It does make me wonder if the fantastic deal that Cipher signed was not one that Bitmain and MicroBT were prepared to sign. This deal may lead to Cipher having inferior mining performance per rig relative to the market leaders they aspire to be. Executive Pay I think too many SPAC deals have padded managers' pockets at the investors' expense. I have avoided several companies on this issue alone. The CEO of Cipher, Tyler Page, previously worked for Bitfury as head of business development. Bitfury started in Holland in 2019 as a Bitcoin miner; they are now an investment company and have invested in several companies across the crypto landscape. Bitfury owns 5% of Hut 8 and 81% of Cipher. Page was at Bitfury for eight months before becoming the founding CEO of Cipher. Page received $103 million in pay and awards in the first two years of Cipher's operation. The proxy statement where this information comes from, explained it was needed to keep him at the business. (As a comparison the CEO of RIOT received a total of $43 million for the same period) Payment to officers (Proxy page 28) The amount of money is significant, but the majority is performance-related restricted stock, so shareholders should benefit if Page gets the total amount. Best in Class: Groupthink? I often listen to earnings calls live; you can get extra information from how the management answers questions and reads out their prepared statements. After this call, I came away convinced that the administration believed they were already the best-in-class mining company. They said the phrase more times than I can remember. I heard no dissent or disagreement, nobody considering they were anything but the best-in-class. The managers already believe they are the best Bitcoin mining investment and cannot understand why the market is not agreeing, and the share price is not increasing at the same rate as others. It reminded me of the Hollywood film in which the characters were so concerned about making money from the asteroid that they forgot it was heading to Earth. Cipher Finances Cipher debt and cash over time (Author Database) Cipher has zero debt but has now spent most of the cash raised in the SPAC transaction. In April, Cipher mined and sold 406 Bitcoins to fund its operations, leaving 427 Bitcoins held. During the last quarter, Cipher reported the following cash movements. Cash use (Earnings Q1 2023) It is a low-cost operation with only 28 employees (compared to 489 at RIOT). However, with a reported $3.9 million of cash and approximately $12 million of BTC its short-term assets are only $16 million, less than the spend in Q1 2023. Cipher did say that it intends to continue funding its growth and operation using the Bitcoin it produces, and even though it has a large ATM shelf prospectus in place ($250 million), it does not intend to issue new shares. It looks like a tight balancing act; I expect that any significant disruption will force Cipher to take on debt or to go to the markets. Conclusion Cipher has grown its capacity quickly and signed excellent agreements, making it a low-cost operator with a potentially sustainable cost advantage due to its PPA. It has grown its capacity with very few employees compared to its peers. Cipher is short on cash and spends the bitcoins it produces to fund operations, so I believe that any drop in production will likely mean a trip to the ATM shelf registration. The PPA with Luminant is its greatest asset and its greatest threat. At the moment, for me, it seems too risky to buy into Cipher.

42420428,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpvxd,1683831093,"Polychain Snubs Lucrative Crypto Arbitrage, Prepares to Trade $6M of ROOK Token on Uniswap","What do you do with millions of dollars ROOK tokens destined to become valueless in just over two months? If you’re Polychain Capital you’ve got two options: dump them on the open market or deploy them via crypto’s savviest arbitrage trade, where they may well net you millions of dollars more.  Polychain is preparing to forgo the gambler’s play – which in an ideal scenario could pay out $8.7 million, according to CoinDesk’s analysis of on-chain data – by seemingly liquidating its $6 million position via decentralized finance (DeFi) exchanges.  The crypto hedge fund moved 100,000 ROOK tokens to a fresh wallet on Wednesday, raising the possibility that it may soon cash in on its long-dormant trove of the erstwhile governance token. (ROOK recently shed its governing rights and became instead a sort of redemption voucher for holders to claim their share of the ROOK project’s treasury.) Hours ago it approved those tokens for sale on Uniswap.  The on-chain moves radically change the calculus driving one of the wildest arbitrage plays in today’s decentralized finance markets. While speculative traders are playing million-dollar musical chairs with intrinsically valueless meme tokens, another set of actors have been methodically draining a portion of ROOK’s treasury with redemption tokens set to become goose eggs on July 12.  Some of those activist investors had hoped Polychain would simply forget to redeem its tokens, leaving more pie for other holders to claim. “Hate to see it,” said one observer of Polychain’s emergence from hibernation this week.  Polychain did not immediately comment.  Polychain invests in Rook  Polychain acquired its ROOK bag for investing a “seven-figure sum” in the DeFi liquidations startup KeeperDAO during the heady days of DeFi summer 2020. The project has since changed its name and product, shed its governing DAO and neutered its governance token, which has rallied over 350% since late March because of activist investors who successfully lobbied for a “rage quit” that would return value to disenchanted holders.  ROOK is now trading for $59 a pop, making Polychain’s current trove – if sold on the open market – worth around $5.9 million. On Thursday Polychain geared up to sell, rather than redeem.  In doing so, Polychain, one of the oldest and richest crypto hedge funds, seemingly thumbed its nose at a slightly risky arbitrage trade that could end up paying millions of dollars more. It is forgoing the opportunity to redeem its ROOK tokens via the “rage quit” smart contract, where it could at most yield $8.7 million. That’s because those ROOK tokens give it the right to a guaranteed slice of ROOK’s treasury, plus the possibility of even more upside if other ROOK holders forget to do the same.  On the open market Polychain might sell its ROOK for more, but the token needs to keep rallying to $87. And it’s got only two months left to get there.  Highly profitable trading strategy  Until mid-July, holders of the ROOK token can exchange their former governance tokens with a smart contract that returns an equivalent number of pROOK tokens, plus $40.76 in USD coin (USDC) per ROOK. Once the date passes, the smart contract will divide up the unclaimed USDC proportionally across all holders of pROOK.  Speculators are putting a 50% premium on the price of ROOK – likely on the belief that a good number of holders will, for whatever reason, forget to redeem their tokens. If redemptions stopped today, each pROOK would be worth roughly $94.32, according to CoinDesk estimates. That’s a massive payout considering those holders already collected $40.76 per their tokens.  Polychain is the fourth-largest holder of ROOK tokens, however. Its whale-sized bag would blow a massive hole in pROOK’s upside and nearly halve its current projected payout. Still, $47.14 in extra cash on top of the $40.76 would still put ROOK’s redemption value well above current market rate.  Activist investoooors  Conceived by activist investors who control half ROOK’s treasury, the redemption method is the product of an agreement between Rook Labs and its community to end their right to govern the project, which builds tools to collect MEV – a trading strategy resembling a riskless arbitrage – on the Ethereum blockchain. The community’s ROOK governance tokens became tickets to a proportional share of $25 million of ROOK’s treasury.  ROOK’s redemption smart contract currently holds $17 million USDC after paying out $7.6 million to 78 different wallet addresses. The top current redeemer – an address with the ENS domain solanabeachresearch.eth – has converted nearly 26,000 ROOK tokens into $1.1 million in USDC. If redemptions stopped today (assuming Polychain does not redeem) that wallet would get $2.44 million for its pROOK. If Polychain acts, it would get $1.22 million.  Polychain’s own payout would be orders of magnitude bigger. If it redeems its ROOK tokens by July 12, it gets a base payout of $4.07 million of USDC from the redemption smart contract. It would later get an additional $4.7 million of USDC for its pROOK – assuming, of course, that no one else redeems.",NEGATIVE,USDC,MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | UNI | USDC,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/05/11/polychain-snubs-lucrative-crypto-arbitrage-prepares-to-trade-6m-of-rook-token-on-uniswap,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/32ea24302cf13f31e03de38bfa9e5f7349991f33-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The recent volatility seen in the markets is a testament to the intensity of this battle. It is becoming increasingly clear that the outcome of this showdown will have significant implications for both assets and the financial world. Related Reading: BONE Token Dominates India Exchange Poll, Outshining Rivals Like PEPE And FLOKI How Bitcoin Plans To Take On The Dollar According to JJ the Janitor, an analyst at Jarvis Labs, any decline in the dollar’s value is good for Bitcoin, and vice versa. This means that the two assets are competing for the same market share, and whichever one comes out on top will dictate the market’s direction for the rest of 2023. As JJ the Janitor notes, DXY has held above the crucial line of support at 100.80 since April 15. This has created market tension, as BTC and DXY have been consolidating in tightly compressed ranges. However, this month-long structure will break sooner or later, and both assets will enter into price discovery – one to the upside, the other to the downside. One notable thing about DXY, according to JJ the Janitor, is that since it peaked during March’s banking crisis, it has been unable to sustain any technical momentum. As a result, it has now registered six lower highs since March’s peak of 105.90, a strong confirmation that it is indeed stuck in a downtrend. For JJ, if the dollar’s yearly low fails to hold upon retest, and if that failure sends DXY crashing below 100 without relief, it would create an ideal set-up for Bitcoin to make a series of higher highs this summer. This would be good news for BTC investors, who have eagerly anticipated a market breakout. Furthermore, The market structure of the DXY is beginning to resemble a pattern that Bitcoin displayed in the spring of 2022, according to JJ the Janitor. Moreover, JJ compared the current market structure of DXY to a chart pattern that BTC displayed last spring, which ultimately led to a collapse in the market. BTC Faces Risk Of Collapse Similar To Last Year’s Death Spiral? As JJ notes, just after the death spiral of LUNA and UST last year, Bitcoin appeared to be holding up surprisingly well while altcoins were collapsing. However, this resilience was short-lived, as BTC ultimately succumbed to a “head and shoulders” chart pattern and collapsed after the death spiral of LUNA caused CeFi exchanges like Celsius and BlockFi to go under. As seen above, DXY shows a similar head and shoulders pattern below resistance, which could signal a potentially disastrous outcome for the asset. This pattern is a bearish technical indicator that suggests a potential reversal of the current trend. However, there is a scenario in which the dollar could regain strength and spoil Bitcoin’s hope for new highs this summer. JJ the Janitor, suggests that if DXY were to move above the May high at 102.53 and then reconquer its 50-day and 100-day moving averages, it would be a clear signal for the market to go “risk-off.” This would be a sign of strength for the dollar and could result in Bitcoin crashing into another retest of its 200-day moving average. At the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin is hovering around $27,100, just below its 50-day moving average, indicating a notable decline of over 3.5% in the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency’s market volatility has increased liquidations of both short and long positions, with Coinglass data indicating a peak of $174 million in the last 24 hours.

Data by crypto intelligence firm Nansen shows that “smart money” wallets – crypto accounts of individual traders or institutions who are known for their profitable moves – have decreased their PEPE stash by $3 million in the past 24 hours, Nansen data shows.  The total amount of PEPE held by smart money has almost halved since late April, per Nansen.  PEPE, a new token based on the “Pepe the frog” meme, has skyrocketed in popularity since it debuted about a month ago, attracting swarms of traders to gamble on its price. The token reached a staggering $1.8 billion market capitalization last Friday within a few weeks, with some early investors pocketing millions of dollars in profit after buying PEPE for a pittance.  However, the token’s price has dropped 66% since hitting an all-time high on May 5, with its market cap falling below $600 million, according to Coinmarketcap.  During the price decline, blockchain data showed that three large PEPE investors had been buying up the token in bulk, raising hopes that a bump in price might be nearing.  Still, the number of tokens held by smart money wallets has been dropping fast, showing no signs that top performing traders are anticipating a bounce.  Smart money balance currently stands at 6.9 trillion PEPE, down from more than 13.5 trillion near the end of April, according to Nansen data. The number of smart money accounts holding PEPE has fallen to 111 from a peak of 135 on May 4.  One example of an early investor appearing to ditch PEPE is pseudonymous crypto trader “vxv.eth.” The wallet has accumulated 1.3 trillion tokens since its initial purchase on April 17, Nansen data shows.

Get ready for “Dencun.”  The name is a portmanteau of two simultaneous upgrades happening on the two main layers of the blockchain. The execution layer, where all protocol rules reside, will undergo the “Cancun” upgrade, while on the consensus layer, which makes sure that blocks are validated, it’s known as “Deneb.”  So developers are cleverly referring to the whole thing as “Dencun” – just like they Brangelina-d the simultaneous Shanghai and Capella upgrades into “Shapella”.  At the heart of Dencun is EIP 4844, more commonly known as “proto-danksharding.” The proposal aims to scale the blockchain by increasing space for “blobs” of data. The changes are also expected to reduce fees for layer 2 rollups.  Ahead of Shapella, developers decided that EIP 4844 would be pushed to the next upgrade, given it was too big of a task to include with staked ETH withdrawals.  On an official call Thursday, Ethereum developers delved into the technical details of EIP 4844.  Tim Beiko, the protocol support lead at the Ethereum Foundation, who conducts these bi-monthly meetings, opened the meeting with, “I'll assume that, by default, we sort of keep this scope for Cancun and if anybody wants to change it going forward, just put something in the agenda.” (Dencun doesn’t exactly roll off the tongue, and the developers themselves sometimes just say “Cancun.”)  The developers didn’t discuss the timing of the Dencun upgrade on Thursday, though they have said in the past that their aim is to push it live in the second half of 2023.  Dencun is also expected to include a few other technical upgrades known as EIPs 6780, 6475 and 1153.  As for the full scope of what Dencun will look like? That’s to be determined over the next few weeks. The developers are testing out other EIPs before they solidify what other proposals will make it into the next big hard fork.

42420463,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpy0b,1683827873,What’s the Reality of Crypto in Crime?,"In hindsight, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) naming veteran cybersecurity expert Eun Young Choi in the winter of 2022 as the first director of the agency’s National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET) may have been the first harbinger of the U.S. government’s recent and decidedly-antagonist approach to the industry this year. The NCET enforcement team, which is now making a beeline for cyber and money laundering crimes in crypto, was tasked with ensuring users stay safe “as the technology surrounding digital assets grows and evolves,” as Choi, who previously worked as a federal prosecutor at the Southern District of New York, said at the time.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Little did anyone know exactly what type of crimes would be revealed as the financial tide flowed out of crypto exposing all those who were “swimming naked” (as Warren Buffett likes to say). Instead of major headline-drawing scandals like FTX and 3AC, Choi’s department seems primarily focused on relatively smaller issues like social media scammers, darknet misuse and online fraudsters – activity that’s rarely discussed openly, but which exists as a sort of background hum for anyone spending time on Crypto Twitter and Discord. (Paul Dylan-Ennis, a frequent contributor to CoinDesk, calls this crypto’s “trash moat,” which seems to fill in anywhere crypto is discussed online.)  See also: How Big Is Crypto Crime, Really?  While scams like these often only damage a single victim at a time, it can still be big money. NCET, along with other agencies, booked upwards of $112,000,000 from busting six such U.S.-based scams. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) estimates $3.31 billion was stolen from people in 2022 through investment fraud, with crypto-related scams accounting for more than a third (~$2.57 billion) of that figure. Worse than just money lost, the proliferation of confidence games – which require bad actors to cultivate long-term relationships and build trust with their marks – has tainted crypto’s reputation.  Any conversation about crypto and crime needs to disclose that, according to the folks with the data, less than 1% of total crypto transactions can be tied to illicit use – at least that’s what Chainalysis reports. It’s a notable point, and one that industry advocates won’t let you forget. Most people using crypto are trading, with growing adoption in “inflation-weary” countries like Turkey and Argentina, Reuters reported. But as much as people want to believe Chainalysis has a God’s eye view into crypto and crime, it’s more likely the figure it cites is a conservative estimate based on the limited number of blockchain addresses it can actually tie to known individuals.  See also: Don't Blame Bitcoin for Ransomware | Opinion  In fact, at a conference hosted by the Financial Times, Choi said recently that “We [the NCET] are seeing cryptocurrency and digital assets really touch every aspect of criminal activity we investigate.” This includes things like ransomware exploits, confidence games and even sanctions-evasion, Choi said, according to Decrypt.  Considering the U.S. Treasury Department has said it’s not all that concerned about blockchain being used to, say, evade the economic blockade on Russia, and that an immutable ledger of transactions (i.e. a blockchain) genuinely is a horrible tool for crime, maybe this should be taken with a grain of salt. Afterall, Choi’s agency was founded to study crypto-related crime, so it shouldn’t be too surprising it’s finding crypto-related crime – but the statement is a reality check.  All this is worth talking about because there’s often a disconnect between the promises made about crypto and the reality on the ground. The statistic may be “only 1% of crypto use is illegal,” but anecdotal experience would say otherwise. I know people who have been SIM-swapped and rug-pulled and bought drugs with bitcoin – and chances are you do too. Choi said part of the reason people fall victim to crypto fraud is because of the haze of misinformation around the technology – like the “FOMO” and hype, but also, possibly, the pretense blockchain is not used for crime.  Still, the very reason crypto attracts scammers and hype-men is why the technology is so necessary. Crypto, being open-source, is open to abuse. Bitcoin is powerful because it’s “money for your enemies,” and if it wasn’t, it wouldn’t be revolutionary. I’m of the mind that it’s a good thing that companies like Chainalysis shattered the illusion that bitcoin is private in any way, because it brings expectations closer to reality. Likewise, it's hardly a bad thing that in a world with police officers, at least some of them direct their attention to surveilling the chain. It’s open, it’s public, it’s bound to happen.

42420451,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpxpF,1683827168,The White House’s Bitcoin Mining Tax Undermines Itself,"In its bid to marginalize the domestic crypto industry, the White House has unleashed financial regulators, deputized the bank sector, and generally harassed crypto firms here. On top of that, it is now trying to push through a de facto ban of mining in the U.S. with the Digital Asset Mining Energy (DAME) excise tax. The proposed levy would add 30% to electricity costs for miners, which would be enough to turn their economics upside down and force them to leave these shores.  CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter is partner at Castle Island Ventures, a public blockchain-focused venture fund based in Cambridge, Mass. He is also the co-founder of Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics startup.  The tax sets an extremely dangerous precedent, as it singles out an industry that lawfully purchases electricity, holding the electricity buyers responsible for the carbon emissions of the underlying generation. This makes no sense. It’s not bitcoin miners’ responsibility to decarbonize the electricity they purchase – that falls to the architects of the grid. If the Biden admin can’t get the grid to be sufficiently green, it should focus on that rather than punishing an industry that buys less than a single percentage point of the electricity produced in the U.S. in a given year. Additionally, the proposed tax may not even be legal. Appellate attorney W. Aaron Daniel has argued convincingly that Bitcoin mining is protected speech under the First Amendment, and that a mining ban singles miners out unfairly, as New York State has done already.  Other industries don’t get held responsible for grid emissions this way, just politically disfavored ones like Bitcoin miners. If this precedent is set, any politically disfavored energy consumer will potentially be in the crosshairs. I could easily imagine the next DAME tax targeting data-centers running AI models that aren’t sufficiently woke, or data centers running servers for uncensored social media. And in a future, possible Trump Administration, who’s to say he wouldn’t use a similar approach to cut off the electricity supply of abortion clinics, leftist universities, Disney World, the NY Times, or any other industries or corporations he dislikes? In this country, resources like electricity should be available to all, not used as a political cudgel to attack specific industries.  Regarding the tax itself, it doesn’t even achieve its stated objectives. In fact, it directly achieves the opposite of what its architects envision.  The objectives of the tax are as follows:  It would in theory raise $3.5b in revenue over 10 years  It would get miners to “pay their fair share” of costs imposed on local communities and the environment  But the tax would actually do the following:  It would directly increase the emissions associated with Bitcoin mining, by pushing miners out of the (relatively low-carbon intensity) U.S., into dirtier jurisdictions  It wouldn’t raise money, as mining in the U.S. would be uneconomical, and miners would simply choose to leave  It would directly empower America’s adversaries, like Russia, China, Venezuela, and Iran – by making (state-sanctioned) mining operations more profitable there  It would eliminate the ability of Bitcoin miners to help monetize the renewable buildout in the U.S., and rule them out from assisting with grid stabilization programs that they actively participate in.  Firstly, and most important, taxing mining in the U.S. does not mean less Bitcoin mining overall. Bitcoin mining is a highly competitive industry, and miners are incentivized to bring capacity online as long as the economics are favorable. China’s Bitcoin mining ban in 2021 did not result in any less Bitcoin mining – the miners simply left China (for the most part) and set up shop elsewhere (including the U.S). Hashrate dipped temporarily after the ban, then came roaring back to a level double the pre-ban amount. The mighty U.S. government is impotent in this case. It cannot persuade the miners to trash their ASICs. It will just mine somewhere else.  In fact, many miners who were using abundant hydro power in the Yunnan or Sichuan provinces moved to Kazakhstan, which has a highly fossil-fueled power grid. Today, the U.S. composes roughly 30-40% of global Bitcoin mining (the best data we have comes from Cambridge University, but it’s somewhat dated and imprecise). The most popular other countries are, in rough order, China (yes, despite the ban, there’s about 17% of hashrate in China), Russia, Canada, Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Paraguay, Norway and Venezuela. We also know that Bitcoin mining directly finances the governments of Russia, Iran, Venezuela and North Korea. These regimes use Bitcoin mining for sanctions evasion, to turn their mineral wealth into cash. Attacking domestic miners in the U.S. hashrate simply means that other miners are more profitable on net, because their share of the pie is bigger.  Read more: Nic Carter - There's No Such Thing as High Fees on Bitcoin  Supporting the state coffers of these direct adversaries should hardly be a goal of the Biden administration, but that’s what the DAME tax would do.  The authors of this tax – I’m told the ringleader is Heather Bouchey of the White House Council of Economic Advisors – acknowledge that miners can freely move abroad, undermining their policy. But they seem to be laboring under the naïve delusion that governments globally will impose similar levies on Bitcoin miners. This is wishful thinking in the extreme. The Biden Admin claims that “China banned such activity completely in 2021,” but we know there is still meaningful Bitcoin mining in China. And the Biden Admin, which has fewer friends abroad by the day, can hardly expect other jurisdictions to move in lockstep with them. The U.S.’s loss is Russia’s, Iran’s, China’s, and Venezuela’s gain. Additionally, the Biden admin has repeatedly called for more transparency in terms of miner emissions and energy impact – they have clear access to this data if miners are based here in the U.S., but virtually no insight if these miners are domiciled in China or Russia.  And if you look at the emissions profile of these alternative domiciles for miners, they are almost all (with the exceptions of Paraguay Norway, and possibly Canada) characterized by a higher carbon intensity of generation than the U.S. American generation, in the aggregate, is 379 g/CO2e, versus 544 g/CO2e for China, 742 g/CO2e for Kazakhstan, 360g/CO2e for Russia, 623 g/CO2e for Indonesia, and 493 g/CO2e for Venezuela.  These numbers are only indicative, as in practice, mining in the U.S. is generally cleaner than the generic grid at the country level. There is considerable mining for instance in West Texas, which has copious amounts of wind and solar, for which there is insufficient transmission. Other hotspots of mining in the U.S. include hydro-powered mining in upstate New York, hydro in the Appalachians, natural gas/nuclear in Ohio and PA, and stranded flare gas in Wyoming, Montana, and the Dakotas. (Mining with otherwise-flared gas is actually carbon-negative overall).  As for the purported “costs” imposed by Bitcoin miners on local communities, that argument is highly dubious. Bitcoin miners are just data-centers. They don’t produce pollutants or toxic waste. Generally, miners locate themselves out of the way in rural areas where electricity is cheap. Due to the laws of physics, electricity doesn’t travel well, so miners consuming energy in rural West Texas are not depriving someone in Dallas of power.  The net effect of the presence of Bitcoin miners on a modern grid is to cut off the tails of the price distribution: they scoop up cheap (or even negatively priced power) when no one is buying it – helping utilities better monetize – and they turn off when power is expensive, giving power back to households during grid scarcity events. Miners actively participate in “demand response” or “controllable load” programs in grids that have them, helping stabilize grids as they have a unique ability to react quickly to changing grid conditions and dial up and down their consumption as needed. During the grid strain last winter and in summer 2022 in Texas, miners dialed down their consumption, so energy could flow back to ordinary households. It’s no wonder that Texas governor Greg Abbott has praised miners for their benevolent presence on the ERCOT grid.  The Administration’s attitude, as revealed by the DAME tax, exposes its technologically regressive, de-growth agenda  Such is the flexibility of mining from a location perspective that a number of miners, like Iris Energy or Terawulf, are able to make the exclusive use of renewables part of their corporate mandate – something that virtually no other industry can match. And there are some miners like Aspen Creek that explicitly support the buildout of new, additional renewables as part of their mission. Any solar or wind installation it helps finance will provide decarbonized power to ordinary households too. This is hardly something the Biden Admin can complain about.  More generally, the Administration’s attitude, as revealed by the DAME tax, exposes its technologically regressive, de-growth agenda. Biden officials aren’t satisfied with Bitcoin miners using clean power, preferring to try and ban the industry entirely.  Bitcoin miners have the prospect to help stabilize increasingly renewable grids and even economically support new wind and solar installations. They can create a new model of location-agnostic datacenters that are co-located with renewable generation, rather than relying on the old hub and spoke model that requires costly transmission. Bitcoin miners are pioneering the model of bringing demand to the source of generation, but other industries will follow, like green hydrogen, fertilizer production, and eventually, other forms of compute.  Additionally, if the Biden Admin wants to carry out their “electrify everything” plan, which is a necessary component of decarbonization, it will need multiples more generation than we have today. Someone will have to pay for this. How, then, is a novel source of demand for electricity, especially renewables, considered a bad thing?  The Biden Administration’s rejection of a buyer of energy that is location-agnostic, interruptible, and uniquely suited to purchasing new renewable sources of power is totally at odds with its own stated objectives for the transformation of the grid. As for the tax, it doesn’t achieve any of its stated aims, and empowers America’s enemies. Clear-eyed policymakers should reject it outright.

42420468,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpy4j,1683826746,Bitcoin Mining Earnings Wrap: Marathon Shares Underperform After New SEC Subpoena,"Shares of Marathon Digital (MARA) fell about 12% on Thursday, underperforming other bitcoin mining peers, despite reporting better-than-expected first quarter results.  The company, one of the largest publicly-traded bitcoin miners, said in a filing on Wednesday that it received another subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is looking into related-party transactions, among other things, that may have violated federal securities law.  Marathon said it will also be increasingly vertically integrating across the bitcoin mining tech stack, “all the way from the mining pool down to the ASIC [application-specific integrated circuits],” CEO Fred Thiel said in a call with investors on Thursday. Marathon is the only major miner to run its own pool.  The miner has so far pursued an asset-light strategy, in which it doesn’t own facilities and infrastructure and operates a lean team. Marathon is not “abandoning” this strategy, Thiel said. It will maintain its “agility” as it diversifies. It will take a more active role in developing facilities, building out technology and innovating in business models.  Marathon's shares are down on a day when most of the crypto-linked stocks are down as bitcoin price fell about 2%.  Several bitcoin miners posted their first-quarter earnings in the past 24 hours, with Marathon and CleanSpark (CLSK) slightly exceeding analyst expectations and some others setting their sights on new operational targets for the year.  Riot Platforms (RIOT) topped analyst estimates, reporting adjusted EPS of $0.04 versus analyst estimates for a loss of $0.14, according to FactSet.  The Texas miner did miss its target for 12.5 exahash/second (EH/s) of computing power, or hashrate, though this wasn't a large surprise as the company in February said 17,000 of its mining rigs were offline due to damage from a winter storm.  Meanwhile, Stronghold Digital Mining (SDIG) reported a net loss of $0.65 per share, roughly the same as last year in the same period, $0.66. Its revenue declined by about 25% to $17.3 million relative to the previous quarter.  Stronghold is accelerating its hashrate guidance, expecting to reach 4 EH/s by the end of the third quarter, as opposed to year-end. The miner is also looking into a new revenue stream, selling ash that can be used as fertiliser or be put back into land to help regrow vegetation. Stronghold burns coal refuse to generate the electricity that powers its mining machines, and sells some of that back to the grid.  Halving talk  Some miners started talking about the next halving event; in about a year from now, the reward for successfully mining a bitcoin block will be cut in half.  CleanSpark (CLSK) said that it has acquired all machines to reach its previously stated year-end target for 16 EH/s of computing power. Crucially, these are mostly Bitmain Antminer XPs which are will likely make the firm ""one of the most efficient"" such that they can take ""optimal advantage of halving next year,"" said CEO Zach Bradford.  CleanSpark (CLSK) reported a net loss of $0.23 per share from continuing operations, better than the average analyst estimate loss of $0.32 according to FactSet data. The per share loss is roughly half of what it reported in the previous quarter, but worse than the $0.05 profit per share in the same period the year before. CleanSpark uses a fiscal year, so the three months ended March 31 were its second quarter for 2023.  CleanSpark reiterated its target to reach 16 EH/s of computing power.  Despite disappointing earnings and its fair share of operational difficulties, the CEO of Canadian Hut 8 Mining (HUT) Jaime Leverton reassured investors. The miner's gigantic stack of bitcoin, at 9,133 BTC at the end of Q1, as well as its diversification into high-performance computing hosting, ""positively"" distinguish the firm ""from pureplay digital asset miners"" who will have greater exposure to increased competition in the space after the halving, Leverton said.  Hut 8's revenue from high-performance computing was about a quarter of the total in the first quarter, however its mining revenue was depressed in the quarter due to operational issues.

A head and shoulders should be taken seriously if it is completed $BTC pic.twitter.com/n5ZiLasmUC — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) May 11, 2023 A head and shoulders pattern in technical analysis is a chart pattern formation of a digital asset that predicts a potential price reversal in market trends. A typical head and shoulders pattern could be seen on a price chart as a baseline with three peaks, where the highest peak (Head) is in the middle of two shoulders with lower peaks of almost the same heights. On establishing this definition, the head and shoulder pattern which is potentially forming for Bitcoin on the daily time frame indicates a bearish reversal of the asset as the second shoulder is seen to potentially form on the daily timeframe. If and when it forms successfully could mean a massive and continued decline in the price of the alpha cryptocurrency. The key areas surrounding the second shoulder formation are decisive levels for bulls and bears to gear into action. So unless Bitcoin bulls swing into action and save price, a successful formation of the second shoulder could occur, sending sell signal opportunities to crypto traders. BTC Price Analysis On The Daily Timeframe At the time of writing, data reports from Coinmarketcap show BTC trading at $27,381, which is a 3% drop in price in the last 24 hours. The market capitalization of the alpha cryptocurrency is also experiencing a 2.91% decline. However, the April Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, released yesterday, brought renewed hopes and positive sentiments back to the crypto markets as it stood at 4.9% lower than the expected 5.0%.

The IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) division is supporting Ukrainian investigators by providing blockchain analysis tools. The IRS donated licenses from crypto investigations company Chainalysis to the Ukraine. Approximately 50 Ukrainian law enforcement officers participated in virtual training, with in-person training still to come.  ""These trainings help participants hone their digital investigative skills to trace the source of blockchain funds and unmask cryptocurrency transactions with cryptocurrency forensic tools,” IRS-CI Chief Jim Lee said in the announcement. “Sharing tools not only safeguards the U.S. financial system, but the global economy.”  Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the countries have used cryptocurrencies to fuel war efforts, evade sanctions and support humanitarian efforts. Evidence indicates that crypto isn't playing a big role in Russia's war effort. Still, U.S. lawmakers remain concerned that Russian oligarchs could be using crypto to circumvent U.S. and European economic sanctions.

""The training is timely and provides a strong impetus for more effective work by the Cyber Police in this area.""  IRS-CI is responsible for conducting financial crime investigations, including tax fraud. Recently, the IRS filed claims worth nearly $44 billion against the estate of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and its affiliated entities. The U.S. Department of Justice is also conducting an inquiry into whether Binance allowed Russian customers to access the exchange in violation of U.S. sanctions related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

42420455,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpxtN,1683825640,Coinbase’s SEC Complaint Draws Allies Depicting U.S. Regulator as Crypto Bully,"Crypto insiders are tying themselves to Coinbase (COIN) as the company seeks to blow up the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) “come in and register” crusade aimed at the digital assets sector.  In a series of “amicus” briefs filed this week, several crypto groups are joining the U.S.-based exchange as they collectively insist the SEC is deliberately wrecking the young industry with an insistence that there’s nothing distinct or special about crypto that warrants different treatment under securities laws. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit granted the various groups' petition to join the case on Thursday.  “The digital-assets industry is stuck in limbo, simultaneously told to ‘come in and register’ yet having no effective means of doing so,” said a brief from Paradigm, a firm that invests in digital assets businesses. “It is no surprise that the SEC’s actions have crippled a nascent industry and sown confusion among countless firms unable to conform to the SEC’s view of the law or challenge that view in court.”  The filings – a means by which outside parties can offer support for legal arguments – are piling support on Coinbase’s request more than two weeks ago to force the SEC to respond to an earlier 2022 petition that the agency provide rules clarifying crypto’s place in securities regulation. While SEC Chair Gary Gensler has made it clear that the agency has no intention of tailoring specific rules for crypto, the regulator has to respond by May 13 in the legal dispute.  Meanwhile, even the U.S. Chamber of Commerce – the broadest of organizations that lobby on behalf of U.S. business interests – has offered criticism for the behavior of the SEC.  “Nobody knows for certain which digital assets, if any, are ‘securities’ under federal law,” the Chamber argued in its brief. “That is no small question. It has immense implications for every person involved in the $1 trillion digital-asset economy, and it is the threshold regulatory question from which all others flow.”  The Crypto Council for Innovation – an industry advocacy group – also contends “the SEC’s aggressive stance towards those seeking to comply impairs investors’ ability to differentiate the good organizations from the bad as they are all painted with the same brush by the SEC.”  The legal fight between the SEC and Coinbase – one of many the regulator is waging in the crypto space – may soon be amplified. The agency has warned Coinbase it’s going to be targeted with an enforcement action for violating securities laws.  SEC Chair Gensler continues to repeat his invitation to crypto trading platforms and token efforts to come into the agency and properly register. He released another video last month that cautioned investors about crypto, accusing much of the industry of openly flouting securities laws.  The ramping up of SEC lawsuits and court actions make it increasingly likely that judicial rulings will steer the course of crypto oversight in the U.S.  UPDATE (May 11, 2023, 17:54 UTC): Adds federal court decision to accept the briefs.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/05/11/coinbases-sec-complaint-draws-allies-depicting-us-regulator-as-crypto-bully,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/32d9fcec8e42e86e754c63e49f2f67c6a6788d7b-2879x1525.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It will support Cookbook’s mission to streamline developers’ work to build out Web3 and reduce development costs for hundreds of companies, the company says.  ""With this investment, we're excited to continue building the most comprehensive platform for web3 developers, aggregating everything they need to launch their production apps,"" Cookbook CEO Tyler Sehr said in a press release.  The funds will also contribute to the platform’s initiatives to co-create free educational content for Web3 builders with developer communities.  That educational initiative will complement Cookbook’s existing offerings, including its platform which gives developers tools to sift through thousands of open-source smart contract templates and access documentation about how to operate those contracts. Those tools allow developers to secure, “battle-tested” codes that support the projects they’re building, Tagus Capital General Partner Leon Mirochnik said in a press release.  Cookbook has served more than 1,500 developers who have accessed more than 3,000 smart contracts through the platform. Its services are increasingly useful for developers as more smart contracts of varying quality flood the web, the company said.  “The increased interest in digital assets in the last 3 years has led to a chaotic upsurge in the number of smart contracts created by thousands of developer communities around the world, but the industry still lacks a robust infrastructure for finding battle-tested open-source smart contracts templates, "" Mirochnik said.

The top digital token dropped 3.5% to $27.20K as of shortly before 1:00 p.m. ET, after topping $28.30K just a day before as U.S. CPI data signaled slowing inflation and thus more room for the Federal Reserve to pause its interest-rate hikes.

42420467,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpy5l,1683821449,CoinDesk Turns 10 – 2020: The Rise of the Meme Economy,"Chris Torres liked to doodle. He was good at it. Maybe he could use that skill for charity? In 2011, when the Tōhoku earthquake ravaged Japan, the Red Cross needed donations. So Torres, then 25, went on a livestream and created real-time sketches; he donated tips to the Red Cross.  The chatroom was small and this wasn’t lucrative; over a week he raised $100. And on the final day, Torres asked the chatroom what they wanted him to draw. They tossed out some random words. Cat! Rainbow! Breakfast pastry! So Torres doodled a cat. Later that night he couldn’t sleep -- the cat stuck in his craw. He fleshed out the drawing and worked through the night. At 5 a.m. he posted it to Twitter, Tumbler, and Reddit and went back to bed.  This feature is part of our CoinDesk Turns 10 series looking back at seminal stories from crypto history.  The next morning, Torres woke up to start his new job as a secretary for an insurance company… and then he checked his email. Hundreds of messages. His drawing, the Nyan Cat, had gone viral. A few days later someone posted it to YouTube; the video has now been seen 205 million times. For many, the Nyan Cat is one of the most iconic images online -- as ubiquitous to the internet as the face of George Washington is to history books.  As for Torres? He toiled in obscurity. For nearly a decade he worked a nine-to-five job -- at one point earning minimum wage -- and was then laid off at the start of COVID.  Enter crypto.  In early 2021, out of work, stuck at home, and with plenty of time on his hands, Torres experimented with NFTs. In February 2021, he sold an NFT of the Nyan Cat for 300 ETH, worth roughly $590,000 at the time. To those just skimming the headlines, the sale signaled that the crypto bull run had gone too far, that the space had lost its collective mind. To Torres, the sale was an overdue recognition of ownership. “It really wasn’t until Web3 that I was able to sustain myself,” says Torres, who now works full-time as an artist and helps other meme-creators monetize their work.  Some view the sale of the Nyan Cat NFT as the birth of crypto’s “meme economy.” Others trace it to Dogecoin. Whatever the origins, Web3 injected energy and money into memes, and memes injected energy and money into Web3. In 2021, this exploded. The price of the original memecoin, Dogecoin, soared from less than a penny to over 75 cents, briefly notching a market cap of over $90 billion. A new breed of yolo-ing “investors,” guided more by Tik-Tok than financial advisors, threw money at meme copycats like Shibacoin. Old-school memes like Grumpy Cat, Disaster Girl, and Harambe sold for eye-popping prices. Memes were the new stocks.  I just love that it made investing more accessible to people. For the first time, this was something related to culture  “It was fun and hilarious and uplifting,” says Gary Lachance, the longtime champion of Dogecoin. “Every day I was just laughing harder and harder.” Lachance, one of the most likable people in the crypto space, throws decentralized global events like the “Doge Disco Project,” where people around the world are encouraged to show “proof of partying.”  And people partied. Just how ubiquitous was Doge in 2021? Here’s one extremely scientific datapoint. Another Doge-enthusiast, Julia Love, happened to read my CoinDesk profile of Dogecoin and Lachance. She was intrigued. So she reached out to him. At first, she thought he was “full of it.” Then after he spoke earnestly about “Doge consciousness” for an astonishingly long time, she was charmed. “Nobody does that,” she says with a laugh. “Usually it’s just me.” They first became friends. Now they’re romantic partners.  The meme-economy spread love, the meme-economy spread money. And the memes injected rocket fuel into the last bull run. Some of the memes (like Doge) are obvious, some are more subtle. “Michael Saylor’s laser eyes, that’s a meme,” says Amanda Cassatt, founder of Serotonin. And that meme had impact. “One of the factors that brought us out of the last bear market was the institutional endorsement of MicroStrategy putting bitcoin on the balance sheet,” says Cassatt. The laser eyes were a symbol of this strategy, and that symbol was mirrored and mimicked and spread like the catchiest of memes. (As the bull run sputtered, the laser eye meme would tilt towards ridicule.)  Read more: David Z. Morris - CoinDesk Turns 10: How The DAO Hack Changed Ethereum and Crypto  It’s likely none of this would have happened without COVID. “Everyone was at home on their screens,” says Torres. “This helped with the awareness of NFTs.”  Meanwhile, a new breed of investors shouted “yolo” in the Reddit forums of Wall Street Bets, gleefully making money on “meme stocks” like AMC and GameStop. For them, investing was a thrilling mix of community, social media and gambling. It was even empowering. Why should suits and hedge funds get to make all the money? Wall Street Bets is a “very similar dynamic” to the crypto memes, says Magdalena Kala, founder of Double Down, a VC shop, in that they both had the same philosophy of “we are going to collectively make something pop.”  Then there was the macro environment -- ultra-low interest rates, a stimulus check bonanza, easy money from the booming stock market. Cassatt notes that in traditional finance, in this kind of low-rate environment, it’s very typical, even logical, for investors to choose “risk on” assets like tech stocks. That same psychology holds in crypto. People who made money holding bitcoin or Ethereum saw the “risk on” potential for even riskier bets on meme-coins. So why not seek juicier returns?  All of these factors help explain the rise of meme-assets. But there’s something deeper at play: the secret sauce of the memes themselves.  The new pop art  Memes were part of the earliest days of crypto. Early bitcoiners posted “Pepe the frog” in forums, and text-based memes like “digital gold,” “magic internet money,” and “HODL” were a kind of shorthand for the early adopters. “They’re so wholesome and nerdy, and they’re a way of saying that it’s okay to be in this really nerdy crowd,” says Linda Xie, co-founder of Scalar Capital.  Memes and crypto were a natural fit. “Crypto people are almost by definition extremely online,” says Kala, adding that the “crypto community has never taken itself too seriously,” which makes for a “cultural alignment.”  But memes predate crypto, they predate the internet, and they’ve been around since before any of us were born. “Memes have been part of culture going back to Egyptian times,” says Torres. “The hieroglyphics had memes on them.” Julia Love considers the World War II posters of women working at factories (flexing a bicep saying “We can do it!”) a type of meme.  I think people were searching for something to connect to, and to feel like they had purpose  The word “meme” was coined in 1976 by Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist, to describe an idea (or “entity”) that could be easily copied by others. “‘Meme’ comes from the [Greek] word mimesis, which just means to mimic or mirror,” says Cassatt. The way groups of people communicate with each other, she says, is by “mirroring things back to each other,” and this usually takes the form of “packages of visual and verbal.”  Cassatt sees memes as a “Darwinian evolution” of these visual and verbal packages, and “the more memetic they are, the more they spread.” (She views the stories in the Bible as a meme.) By “Darwinian,” she means survival of the viral-iest: the ones that slingshot around the world are the most engaging; the ones that are boring are left to die. And, to Cassatt, it makes perfect sense that memes have gained prominence, as “we’re in an increasingly virtual world.”  This “Darwinian evolution” could even explain the sneaky power of memes. “Memes are the new pop art,” says Ben Lashes, the world’s first “meme agent” who helps creators monetize their work. When a meme goes viral, says Lashes, almost by definition, that’s proof of artistic merit. “Anyone can make a meme and it doesn’t go anywhere. It gets one like from your grandma,” says Lashes. But the memes that we share with our friends? “They have risen up because the collective out there has this emotional, visceral reaction to it.”  Back in the heyday of 2021, Lachance told me that he considered the Doge to be the “modern Mona Lisa.” I took this as a joke. But Lashes is now making a sober and thoughtful case for memes as art -- modern-day Warhol. He notes that the first Grumpy Cat photo was shared by someone who had never posted before. They weren’t an influencer. They had no platform. They simply posted a photo that said “Meet Grumpy Cat;” overnight it had thousands of upvotes. “There’s this X factor when you see something, and it makes you react. It forces you to react. There’s no other choice in your soul than to react,” says Lashes, adding that there’s a “magic element to it.” This is the essence of art.  Read more: Jeff Wilser - CoinDesk Turns 10: The Legacy of Mt. Gox – Why Bitcoin’s Greatest Hack Still Matters  So if memes are a valid form of art, then why is it wrong or laughable for the artists -- the meme creators -- to get paid? Or why is it shameful to collect art? It’s true that $590,000 is a lot of money for a pixelated cat. It’s also true that the Nyan Cat has brought joy, or at least moments of levity, to hundreds of millions of people. You could argue that Torres is still underpaid. “Art doesn’t have to always be serious,” says Lashes. “Art can be fun and should be fun.”  Lashes works to get these artists paid. A former musician and frontman for the band The Lashes, for over a decade, he has helped meme-creators get compensated. Consider the “Disaster Girl” meme, featuring Zoë Roth, who was four years old when the photo was taken and is now in her twenties. Lashes describes the Disaster Girl meme as “one of the most epic photos of all time,” but Roth received nothing. She sold it as an NFT in 2021 and it helped pay for her college; she just graduated with a degree in political science.  The Disaster Girl meme, and others like it, have the power to transcend verbal language -- whether you’re in San Francisco or Bangladesh, you’ll get the joke. That helps strengthen communities that are dispersed around the globe, and, as Xie says, “It’s always a search for community in this culture.”  That community was needed in the depths of COVID. “I think people were searching for something to connect to, and to feel like they had purpose,” says Julia Love, who, during COVID, raised a six-year-old daughter while working from home. She found her tribe with weekly Zoom parties for the DDP, or “Doge Disco Party,” where she’d create elaborate outfits and “get really silly,” like the time she and her daughter dressed up as robots and “did the robot” for an hour.  But let’s speak plainly. Some liked Dogecoin for the dances, but more -- many more -- liked it as a way to make money. The meme-economy expanded the scope of what you could invest in. Before memes and NFTs, the main way to invest in crypto was to purchase bitcoin, Ethereum, or other cryptocurrencies. That was intoxicating for many, a turn-off for others.  Memes felt different. Less intimidating. More fun. “I just love that it made investing more accessible to people,” says Xie. “For the first time, this was something related to culture.” Suddenly art-lovers saw something for them on the menu. “I know a ton of people who did so well investing in NFT art and collectibles, and they couldn’t care less about DeFi, bitcoin, and Ethereum” says Xie, adding that the meme-economy ushered a more diverse, more inclusive group of people into the space.  For example, Xie cites the inclusivity of the “Crypto Coven” NFT community (she personally invested in it), which is packed with playful memes about witches. “It’s almost all women, and the community was really welcoming,” says Xie. Or for another vibey community that’s fueled by memes, Kala points to the popularity of, ahem, “CryptoDickButts.”  But does investing in CryptoDickButts really count as “investing”? We’re using that word quite loosely, and somewhere Warren Buffett is convulsing. Even Kala is quick to make a distinction between “investing” and “speculating,” and considers memes to be the latter, as “you’re buying into the story and not much else.”  And she’s fine with that. Assuming you are not risking more than you can afford to lose, should speculation be mocked? Kala argues that the expected value of buying into a memecoin is “much higher than playing the lottery,” yet society doesn’t “judge boomers for buying lottery tickets.”  Read more: Michael J. Casey - CoinDesk Turns 10: What We Learned From Reporting a Decade of Crypto History  The meme-economy made it fun for younger people to think about finance. “I would argue that with memes, it’s a continued progression towards finance as a hobby,” says Kala, who considers it a form of entertainment. “Now entertainment is not just watching a movie on Netflix or going to a concert,” she says, but also includes “gambling or investing as a shared experience.”  Kala says that like the Redditors of WallStreetBets, the meme-buyers were mostly “retail traders” -- regular people with small-ish accounts, as opposed to big institutions like hedge funds. “A much higher proportion of people are just there for the joke,” says Kala. “They’re there for the entertainment, for yolo, for the number going up.” Contrast that with bitcoin, which now has institutional investors like MicroStrategy and Cathie Wood’s Ark Investments. Not so with crypto memes. The value of the memes is only propped up by a shared belief in a story, and as Kala says, “It’s a casino. Everyone knows that at some point the music is going to stop.”  Think about casinos. If you’ve spent enough time in Vegas, you’ll recognize that inflection point, often around 4 a.m., when the vibes shift from tipsy and fun to drunken and dark. Same with the meme-economy casino. “It was a bit too much of a frenzy,” says Xie. “When you have NFTs going for insane amounts of money to participate in the community, it’s antithetical to the space as a whole.” She has sour memories of NFT parties where people parked their lambos as a flaunting of wealth, and says “it drew in the wrong crowd for the wrong reasons.”  The meme-economy made it fun for younger people to think about finance  The early memes felt organic and goofy and fun -- like Torres drawing a rainbow cat. Then came the grift. Lashes says that once people realized there was money in memes, hucksters would send him DMs claiming to be the meme’s creator, asking him to help them monetize. (Lashes says his group performs due-diligence to prevent this.) “There were a lot of scams and rug pulls,” says Kala. Digital rocks sold for over $1 million. “It’s literally just a rock,” says Xie. “This wasn’t fully based on silly internet culture.”  So the music of the casino, of course, eventually stopped. It had to. If you put $100 in Dogecoin in May 2021 at the peak of its hype -- when the “CEO of Dogecoin,” Elon Musk, hosted SNL -- you would now have only $10. NFT sales slumped by 83% in 2022.  Then again, the silly internet culture is hard to kill. Memes are resilient. Julia Love and Gary Lachance, the Dogecouple, have been crisscrossing the country in a “Dogeclaren” that Love won at a crypto conference, and they’re currently in Japan for a pilgrimage to meet the actual 17-year-old shiba inu that inspired the Doge. (And, while Lachance doesn’t care much about price or speculation, it’s also true that the value of Dogecoin has risen 40% since October). New memecoin PEPE has (at least temporarily) caught fire. And there are even early experiments with AI-generated memecoins. (God help us.)  And not everyone agrees that the meme-economy went too far or became “too much.” Lachance seems almost startled by the idea, arguing that the rise of Dogecoin makes “way more sense than the warfare-currencies dominating the world.”  Lachance says this on a Zoom with Julia Love at his side -- he literally found Love through Doge. Why can’t Doge bring love to others?  “Ideally, Doge becomes the future of all trade and commerce in the world,” says Lachance, not a trace of humor in his voice. He gives a final visual: Imagine going to an authoritarian nation, looking at the currency, and instead of seeing the face of a dictator you see the curious smile of the Doge. Lachance chuckles. So is that too far? Too much? For Lachance, “We’re far, far away from too much.”",POSITIVE,ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | ETH | TRADING,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/05/11/coindesk-turns-10-2020-the-rise-of-the-meme-economy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/327fa83a51306d04bf608888656bfa4e5d0fab56-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42420464,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpy1d,1683821354,Pudgy Penguins NFTs: Everything You Need to Know About the Adorable Animal Project,"Project name: Pudgy Penguins  Project type: PFP (profile picture)  Original mint date: July 2021  Original mint price: .3 ETH (approximately $600 at the time)  Floor price on OpenSea: 5.99 ETH as of 5/22/2023  Highest sale to date: Pudgy Penguin #6873, which sold for 400 ETH in August 2022  Where can I buy Pudgy Penguins? Pudgy Penguins can be purchased on the Pudgy Penguin Marketplace and many secondary marketplaces, including OpenSea, Blur and LooksRare.  Runs on: Ethereum  What are Pudgy Penguins?  Pudgy Penguins is a collection of 8,888 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) featuring cute, chubby cartoon penguins that embody “love, empathy, & compassion.” The penguins feature rarity traits such as different shirts, hats, glasses and backgrounds. Pudgy Penguin holders, who refer to themselves as “The Huddle” and “Pengus,” receive exclusive access to experiences, events, intellectual property (IP) licensing opportunities and other perks.  While the overall vibe put forth by the project is to create a positive, collaborative community, the project has faced controversies along the way. The avatar or profile picture project (PFP), which launched in 2021, changed hands after the community voted to oust the projects’ founders in January 2022. Holders claimed that the founding team failed to fulfill many of their promises to the community, such as launching a children's book and a metaverse game. Following the vote, the project was scooped up by entrepreneur Luca Netz for $2.5 million in April 2022.  Since Netz took over Pudgy Penguins, he has expanded the reach of the project with deals to license Pudgy Penguins NFTs to be made into physical toys. The project saw a Christmastime rally in 2022. Recently, the project has gotten a $9 million infusion in a seed funding round led by 1kx to create an IP brand based on the flightless bird images.  Penguin expansion projects  Lil Pudgy NFTs: These smaller offshoot versions of the Pengus are a collection of 22,222 NFTs released in December 2021. Pudgy Penguin NFT holders were able to generate a free Lil Pudgy per NFT. In January 2023, they became cross-chain in a partnership with LayerZero, enabling them to travel between Polygon, BNB Smart Chain and Arbitrum.  Pudgy Rods: A collection of fishing rods also known as “rogs” in the community due to a misspelling. The free-to-claim NFTs for Penguin holders were originally pictured as eggs wrapped in red ribbons and then were revealed to be fishing rods in December 2021. The reveal was generally considered a flop and is seen as a turning point in the lore of the brand that led to the ousting of the founders.  Pudgy Toys: On May 18 2023, Netz announced the release of physical toys based on the Pudgy Penguins IP called Pudgy Toys, calling them ""the first mass-market product licensed directly from the community,"" in a blog post. The toys also give buyers entry to ""Pudgy World"" and aims to simplify Web3 onboarding by supplying a wallet, Soulbound NFT and Tradeable NFTs just by registering with an e-mail address. According to listings on the Pudgy Toys' Amazon page, most toys will ship in June.  What is the project’s utility and IP rights?  Beyond joining a passionate community, called “the huddle,” and its corresponding Discord, owning a Pudgy Penguin NFT allows access to holder-only events, meet-ups and activities, such as parties at NFT.NYC.  Holders have IP licensing opportunities and are granted rights to create commercial projects using the imagery of the Pudgy Penguin NFTs they own, provided the annual revenue is under $500,000. Holders are asked to submit a form to alert the team about any commercial projects and if anyone exceeds the $500,000 gross revenue, they must alert the team within 15 days of crossing that threshold.  What do we know about the team?  As touched on earlier, the current owner of the project is Netz Capital, led by Luca Netz, but the project’s founders were pseudonymous Twitter users ColeThereum and Mr. Tubby, who launched the project with the help of a freelance artist named Mingo.  The unraveling of the initial team came after doubts about the founders were raised and concerns grew over undelivered promises from the project’s initial roadmap. These rumblings came to a head after two events: First, the disappointing “Rog” NFT reveal and then an explosive Twitter thread from user 9x9x9x, which revealed the founders had allegedly drained funds from the project.  Following these events, the community voted to oust ColeThereum and Mr. Tubby and find a new, better home for the IP. After a few months, Netz Capital bought Pudgy Penguins and the IP associated with the brand for $2.5 million in ETH.

42420456,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpxrJ,1683819629,"Bitcoin’s High Fees Brought Back Bull Market-Level Mining Revenue, But Not for Long","Bitcoin (BTC) miners, battered by the brutal crypto winter of 2022, are racking up record revenue as transaction fees on the network have soared to their highest levels in two years.  A miner's revenue is made up of two components: block rewards, currently set at 6.25 BTC ($175,000), and transaction fees, which vary based on network demand. Traditionally, or at least since 2017, fees have been lower than rewards.  However, in recent days, some bitcoin miners are getting paid more to process transactions on the blockchain than they’re rewarded for creating new bitcoin, partly due to the Ordinals protocol.  Ordinals allow for the inscription of non-fungible tokens and the creation of bitcoin-backed fungible tokens, known as BRC-20s. These tokens have been used to create meme coins that have seen massive jumps in value in the past week or so.  On Tuesday, the transaction fees on bitcoin represented 75% of the current block reward, currently at 6.25 BTC, as opposed to the usual 2%-5%, said Tim Rainey, treasurer at Greenidge Generation Holdings (GREE). “This is approximately equivalent to the increase in mining revenue if the bitcoin price surged from the current $28,000 level to $50,000,” he said.  The bitcoin price last was around $50,000 levels back in 2021’s bull market, when miners were bringing in record levels of margins. However, the margins vaporized very quickly, in 2022, after bitcoin collapsed, energy costs surged and capital markets essentially stopped providing new funding.  “The last two days (Sunday and Monday) have consecutively been Cipher's highest revenue days ever. We mined roughly 21 bitcoin on Sunday and roughly 24 bitcoin on Monday,” the firm’s CEO Tyler Page told CoinDesk.  Read more: Pump the BRCs: The Promise and Peril of Bitcoin-backed Tokens  It is a welcome reprieve for an industry that saw major firms like Core Scientific (CORZ) and Compute North entering bankruptcy proceedings due to a continued bear market.  Short-term expectations  However, the unexpected revenue bump may not last long as users are already looking elsewhere for their transactions due to high fees.  This trend is expected to last only another week or so, according to TeraWulf (WULF) Chief Strategy Officer Kerri Langlais.  For example, use of the Lightning Network, a layer 2 solution for transaction processing, as well as stablecoins in some regions, have seen an uptick in transactions. Meanwhile, the spike in profitability isn’t enough to incentivize miners to dust off their older mining computers to decongest the network, according to TheMinerMag Head of Research Wolfie Zhao.  Read more: Litecoin Transactions Hit Record High as Bitcoin Fees Surge Amid BRC-20 Frenzy  “The hype [around Ordinals] may not be sustainable” and fees have already fallen 60%-70% from their peak, but it is possible that as use cases increase demand for block space, so will fees, according to Charles Chong, senior manager of business development at Foundry, which operates the world’s largest mining pool and is owned by CoinDesk’s parent company, Digital Currency Group.  Ethan Vera, chief operations officer at mining services firm Luxor Technologies, said that even if the hype wears off, “a higher base demand on the mempool is established resulting in higher transaction fees for miners.” Mempools are essentially waiting rooms for bitcoin transactions.  Mining pools to the test  The sudden surging fees have also put the mining pools to the test as their revenue composition has changed drastically.  About 17%-25% of their revenue contribution in May came from transaction fees, as opposed to the range of 1%-3% that was the case for the rest of 2023, according to TheMinerMag’s Zhao.  This unexpected change is resulting in pools needing to hold more bitcoin reserves, according to Foundry’s Chong. “For FPPS [full pay per share] pools, this means they need to hold more BTC reserve as the pool luck component is exacerbated by the high fees, meaning if a pool is unlucky during this period, it will incur a larger loss paying miners the fees that it did not collect,” he said.  FFPS pools, the method Foundry USA also uses for payouts, share the transaction fees with the miners according to how much hash rate they contribute, based on an estimated average transaction fee for a given time period. This means the pool should have to keep more bitcoin in reserve in case it gets unlucky and doesn't win enough blocks with enough revenue to meet user payouts, explained Colin Harper, head of content and research at Luxor.  At the same time, congestion and rapid changes in the mempool are challenging pools’ technology as they have to “quickly adapt order the transactions and maximize fee reward to the customers,” Chong added.  The way ahead  One possible silver lining of this short-lived phenomenon is that it gives a glimpse of the future of bitcoin miners, when the bitcoin network will eventually stop giving out block rewards sometime around 2140, at which point miners will only be bringing in transaction fees.  “While it is ultimately up to the market to determine the sustainability of this new application [Ordinals], we view this as a positive long-term development for the security budget of Bitcoin as block rewards will eventually cease and miners will entirely rely on transaction fees for compensation,” wrote investment bank Stifel GMP’s analyst Bill Papanastasiou in a research report.  The transaction fees debacle also shows the importance of miners for the integrity of the whole network.  “Without mining there is no BTC,” and miners will be well compensated for in the future as the uses of bitcoin grow, said TeraWulf’s Langlais.

This recent report shows the IRS filed dues of $44 billion in taxes associated with FTX and its subsidiaries. The disclosure revealed the agency filed the tax bill under administrative claims, prioritizing them over the creditors’ claims in the bankruptcy case. Will Court Prioritize IRS Claims Over Creditors? A filing by the IRS claiming billions of dollars in tax owed by Alameda Research has been circulating online. The filing shows the IRS is claiming over $20.4 billion in unpaid partnership and payroll taxes from Alameda Research alone under administrative priority. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Blasts Above $28,000 Following 4.9% April CPI Report The IRS filed 45 claims worth $44 billion in unpaid taxes from the now-bankrupt FTX exchange and its sister companies. However, the tax filing category under administrative priority has drawn more attention than the amount after circulating the Internet. A section of the US Bankruptcy Code states that claims under administrative expenses receive priority distribution. That means administrative claims have the highest priority among creditor claims in a bankruptcy case. The IRS tax bill under administrative claims means the court will likely consider them during funds distribution before other unsecured FTX creditors. However, the dispute is still in motion, and the court is yet to determine how the filing affects the situation. Nonetheless, the current situation sparked people’s curiosity. A partner at General Catalyst, Nick Van Eck, is curious about how to calculate the amount and where the funds will come from. But while reactions across the internet continue to emerge, the IRS remained silent without providing any details regarding the matter.

42420459,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpxwT,1683818837,"Binance’s VC Arm, With Over 200 Investments, Focuses on 'Explosive' Potential for Web3","Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange in terms of trading volume, may have found itself in the crosshairs of the U.S. regulators, but its venture capital (VC) arm, Binance Labs, continues to invest across the Web3 ecosystem.  Despite the looming U.S. regulatory uncertainties and a continued bear market, Binance Labs has been able to grow its assets to $9 billion at the end of the first quarter from $7.5 billion last August. The VC arm expanded because it believes Web3 is still in its early stages and that blockchain technology has yet to see an “explosive” use case outside of financial instruments, Yibo Ling, the chief business officer of Binance Labs, said during an interview with CoinDesk.  “We are very much long-term investors in this space. We're not a fly by night – come in, and try to get a quick hit and move on because our core business is obviously long on the entire industry,” Ling said. He also added that his firm looked for investment opportunities that haven’t been rocked by market conditions or potential regulations.  The VC’s parent company, Binance, has found itself in the target of U.S regulators following a lawsuit from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) this year. Like many other crypto firms, heightened scrutiny for the centralized crypto exchange coincides with an extended bear market and follows the collapse of centralized exchange rival FTX.  The move by the regulators and policymakers has spooked many industry veterans and investors alike. Some observers have even called it a ""war on crypto,"" while industry giants like Coinbase have hit back against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), arguing that the markets regulator is providing insufficient regulatory guidance for companies operating in the crypto sector.  FTX: A head scratcher  Binance rival FTX had an epic collapse late last year. At one point Binance agreed to bail the company out, but that deal fell apart in a day amid the fast-moving disaster. A cascade of events following that, eventually led to the current gloomy market environment.  Companies that FTX’s own VC division invested in were left in an awkward position after the collapse.  “We were always surprised by the level of investment that [FTX] made in their VC arm, as well as their marketing,” said Ling. “We’re obviously much bigger than they are, and we were looking at how they were spending money and how we were spending money and we were just scratching our heads on how they had the resources available to do what they did,” he added.  Centralized exchanges faced increased scrutiny in the wake of the FTX, particularly about potential liquidity concerns. However, Ling said he hasn’t heard concerns from portfolio companies if Binance Labs could see any notable disruptions of its own.  “There’s no way to draw a line between the two points of where we’re at, and where [FTX is] at,” he said.  10x returns  Binance Labs has over 200 portfolio companies from over 25 countries and 50 of those projects were incubated through Binance programs. Some of the portfolio companies include Ethereum sidechain Polygon, security firm CertiK, infrastructure provider Polyhedra Network and South Korean game developer GOMBLE.  To keep growing its investments, the VC firm is currently deploying funding from a $500 million fund it announced last summer, which included Binance, DST Global Partners, Breyer Capital and Whampoa Group as its limited partners (LPs). Returns are “well in excess of 10x at the moment,” said Ling.  The venture capital arm invests across all Web3 verticals and all investment stages, though there’s a “very strong preference” for early-stage bets on seed and Series A-stage companies that could benefit the most from the operational support of the broader Binance ecosystem.  Asked what crypto sectors will have the strongest positions coming out of the bear market, Ling highlighted decentralized finance (DeFi) and infrastructure projects that make it easier for developers and users to make the transition from Web2 to Web3.  One area of interest is the path between Web2 and Web3 gaming, where even legacy studios are looking for ways to add blockchain technology to their ecosystems, Ling noted.  Sticking with Binance Labs’ long-term vision, Ling thinks the industry still has a long way to go and the sector has barely scratched the surface.  “We’re still very much in the early days in Web3, which makes it equal parts exciting and frustrating because there’s a lot to be done,” he explained.

42420453,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpxoD,1683817468,"BlockFi Customers Can Be Repaid $300M Held in Custodial Accounts, Judge Says","BlockFi custodial wallet users can be returned nearly $300 million, as a New Jersey judge ruled on Thursday May 11 that assets sitting in the wallets belong to clients rather than the estate of the bankrupt crypto lender.  Bankruptcy Judge Michael Kaplan ruled against repaying a further $375 million in funds that clients tried to withdraw from BlockFi’s interest-bearing accounts, known as BIA, after the company froze funds last year, as ripples from the collapse of FTX spread through the crypto ecosystem.  “The court finds that all digital assets held by the debtors in custodial omnibus wallets are indeed client property, and not property of the bankruptcy estates, subject, of course, to possible avoidance and clawback rights,” Kaplan said, but had less happy news for BIA customers.  “No transfer request by customers between the BIA and the custodial wallet accounts initiated after 8.15 pm on November 10, 2022 were effectuated and completed,” Kaplan said, despite the crypto company's user front-end appearing to confirm that they had successfully shifted funds.  “BIA account holders deposited their assets into these accounts with the full knowledge that they were undertaking certain risks in exchange for the chance of greater returns,” he said, but custodial wallet holders “did not share this risk or return and should not have their ownership of non estate property diluted by those who took on such risks.”  Under bankruptcy law, funds which are deemed to belong to customers can be returned immediately, rather than being divided up among creditors of the company’s estate.  In this case reimbursement was held up by a dispute over the status of funds held in BIA which customers tried to liquidate after Nov. 10, when BlockFi paused transfers, and Nov. 18, when it made corresponding changes in the app.  At a hearing held Monday, Deborah Kovsky-Apap of law firm Troutman Pepper argued that her clients – who all attempted to transfer BIA holdings in that interim period – should be included in any repayment.  It’s “not fair to be able to ignore the plain language of the terms of service” that promises transactions will happen instantly, Kovsky-Apap said, adding that BlockFi was effectively trying to discriminate in treatment among customers who were all in the same situation.  Michael B. Slade, representing BlockFi, said that no sale of the assets had been completed, even though those clients received email confirmation that it had, as the user interface had been “deliberately divorced” from underlying transactions.  BlockFi filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Nov. 28, 2022, a few weeks after FTX, from which the crypto lender had sought a bailout in June.

12538269,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=531237,1683817204,"Uniswap (UNI) Surges After A Bumpy Ride, Is Bearish Run Over?","Uniswap (UNI) has been experiencing downward movement due to general market sentiment. The downtrend started on April 19, dropping from $6 to $5. However, the price rises gradually, indicating that the bulls are building momentum. This slight increase has left traders wondering if the bearish trend is over and whether things might start getting better for Uniswap (UNI). Signs of Bullish Sentiment As UNI Surges Notably, UNI is up today by 3.27% at a high of $5.12 within the last 24-hour trading session. The 24-hour trading volume is also up by over 97.72% at $68 million, signifying that the UNI market is experiencing high activity. This data shows that the bulls build strong momentum with positive market sentiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Blasts Above $28,000 Following 4.9% April CPI Report Moreover, the token still holds the 22nd position on the CoinMarketCap ranking with a market cap of $2.9 billion. According to CFGI.io, the market sentiment towards Uniswap (UNI) is bullish. The indicator confirms the bullish sentiment with a 61 reading, meaning investors are greedy. This further shows that investors are optimistic about the future potential, and the recent increase in price may be sustainable. UNI Technical Analysis Even with the increasing price and trading volume, the technical indicators for UNI remained contradictory, with some pointing towards a potential bear market. UNI is currently trading below its 50-day & 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) and has formed a Death Cross, a bearish sign. The Death Cross contributed to the price drop as it caused traders and investors to sell their holdings or take short positions. The SMA indicator suggests that both the long-term and short-term trend is bearish. But, the price might reverse if the bulls hold their long positions. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), with a reading of 40.20, suggests that the asset is not in the overbought or oversold regions but in a neutral range. This indicates that there’s no significant buying or selling pressure and UNI might experience some level of consolidation or a positive price change. Related Reading: Bitcoin Funding Rates On BitMEX Turn Deep Red, Here’s Why This Is Bullish The MACD indicator suggests a bearish trend, with the MACD currently below the signal line. The histogram also confirms the bearish momentum as it is trading below zero. UNI is trading at $5.14 at the time of writing. The bears are trying to break through the first support level of $4.746, a level several times. However, if the bulls build strong momentum and break above the significant resistance level of $5.731, it might trigger a bullish trend. The next support and resistance level will be $3.358 and $7.651. Uniswap’s price can also lose most of its gains if the bears break the support levels successfully.

Unique ownership  The most significant advantage of NFTs in the music industry is the ability to grant unique ownership of digital content. With NFTs, artists can issue limited edition digital albums that have unique ownership and can be sold for a premium price. This enables fans to own exclusive digital content and gives artists an additional revenue stream. As a result, musicians may start to produce music that is more geared towards creating one-of-a-kind pieces that fans will want to own and collect.  Royalty payments  The traditional music industry model has seen artists receive a small portion of the revenue generated from music sales. However, with NFTs, the ownership of music is made clear on a blockchain network, allowing for transparent royalty payments. This means that artists can receive a larger portion of revenue generated from music sales, which in turn will result in a change in the way music albums are published. Artists may choose to release music albums through NFTs to ensure that they receive a fair share of the revenue generated from music sales.  Tokenization of music  NFTs enable the tokenization of music, which means that the music can be divided into smaller, more manageable parts. This enables artists to monetize specific parts of their music, such as the rights to use a specific beat, the lyrics of a song, or even a single guitar riff. This means that artists can sell their music in smaller parts, which can be more accessible to fans.  Fan interaction  NFTs provide artists with the ability to interact with fans in ways that were previously impossible. With NFTs, artists can release exclusive digital content to fans, such as backstage footage or recordings of live performances. This allows fans to feel more connected to the artist and creates a sense of exclusivity, which can result in increased fan engagement. Because of this, artists may start focusing on creating digital content that can be shared exclusively with fans.  Digital collectibles  NFTs allow music albums to be released as digital collectibles. This creates a new way for fans to own music and creates a sense of exclusivity, which can increase fan engagement. The unique ownership of NFTs means that they can be sold as a rare higher priced item, which creates a new revenue stream for artists. This will result in artists aiming to create unique digital content that can be sold as collectibles.  Protection of intellectual property  NFTs enable artists to protect their intellectual property, which has been a challenge in the music industry. With NFTs, the ownership of music is made clear on a blockchain network, which makes it difficult for others to copy or plagiarize music. This provides artists with greater protection of their intellectual property and enables them to control the distribution of their music. With artists being able to create music with greater freedom, knowing that their intellectual property is protected they may write music in a completely different way.  Music as an investment?  As NFTs continue to revolutionize the music industry, financial advisors should be thinking about ways to potentially invest in music albums for their clients in the future.  The tokenization of music and the ability to create unique digital content means that music albums can now be viewed as an asset class, providing a new investment opportunity for clients.  Investing in NFTs that represent ownership of music albums can provide clients with exposure to a unique asset class that is not correlated with traditional investments. This can help to diversify their investment portfolios and reduce risk.  Financial advisors can work with their clients to identify high-quality music albums that are likely to appreciate in value and generate potential revenue streams. They can also work with music industry experts and analysts to identify emerging artists and music trends that may represent investment opportunities. This can be particularly relevant for clients who have a passion for music and may be interested in investing in emerging artists.  However, investing in music albums through NFTs does come with risks. The value of music albums and NFTs can be volatile and can fluctuate based on the popularity of the music and the artist. Furthermore, the lack of regulatory oversight in the NFT market can make it difficult for financial advisors to assess the risks associated with NFT investments.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,DJ Windle,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/05/11/music-albums-as-an-asset-class,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fd252db4117ea8708a8e4539ce1e31724eff95d7-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

12536945,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=531215,1683813631,"Bitcoin Rebounds From $27,100 After Spike In Bearish Sentiment","Data shows the Bitcoin sentiment had turned quite bearish just before the asset’s price had rebounded up from the $27,100 level. Bitcoin Recovers Shortly After FUD Takes Over Market According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, investors showed high levels of fear around the time of the local bottom during the past day. The relevant indicator here is the “social volume,” which measures the total number of social media text documents that mention a given topic like cryptocurrency or Bitcoin. These social media text documents include a variety of sources, like Reddit, Twitter, Telegram, and other forums. The social volume only tracks how many such documents mention the term at least once. So this means that even if a post contains the keyword several times, its contribution to the social volume will still be only one unit. The significance of the social volume is that it tells us about the amount of discussion that certain topics are getting from social media participants at the moment. In the context of the current topic, social media is used to know the degree of the bearish and bullish sentiments in the market. Here is a chart that shows the trend in these social volumes for Bitcoin over the last week: Looks like the bearish sentiment has seen a sharp surge recently | Source: Santiment on Twitter To separate the social volume for discussions that imply a bullish mentality, terms such as “buy, bottom, bullish” have been chosen, while keywords like “sell, top, bearish” are the ones selected for pinpointing a bearish sentiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply Is Moving From American Holders To Asian Wallets: Glassnode As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin social volume for the bearish sentiment seems to have observed a large spike during the past day. This surge in the indicator had come after BTC had plunged from above $28,000 to around $27,100. This suggests that the BTC investors had turned very fearful during this panic selloff. A similar level of bearish sentiment was also observed only a couple of days back, as the chart highlights. The turn in market mentality back then had also come following a decline (this time from the $29,000 mark to the low $27,000 levels), and interestingly, it had coincided with the local bottom in the price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Funding Rates On BitMEX Turn Deep Red, Here’s Why This Is Bullish The spike this time has also occurred simultaneously with the possible local bottom formation at $27,100, as the price of the cryptocurrency has recovered a little bit since then. Historically, whenever the market has held an opinion too unbalanced in any particular direction, the price has tended to move opposite to this opinion of the masses. Because of this, in times when the market has seen large amounts of greed, a local top has generally become more probable. Naturally, the same goes for local bottoms as well, since they have usually formed when FUD has taken over the minds of the investors. The recent spike appears to have been an example of this pattern, and so far, it looks like the latest bearish sentiment spike may also be the same.

The three filings included the Roundhill Ether Strategy ETF , Direxion Ether Strategy ETF and the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF . All three funds aim to provide investors exposure to Ethereum by investing in Ether futures contracts. It should be noted that all three funds do not directly invest in the cryptocurrency itself and do not take direct holding of the digital asset. The three funds look to trade in a similar format to the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ), although that ETF focuses on Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) rather than Ethereum.

Wormhole proposed the integration to the Threshold community in mid-April, saying its objective was to help threshold bitcoin (tBTC) become the dominant bitcoin representative token in on-chain DeFi ecosystems. That agreement won strong community support and was fully approved on April 29 after a governance vote.  tBTC is a Bitcoin-backed token that allows users to access the Ethereum and cross-chain DeFi ecosystem. Each tBTC token is fully backed by 1 bitcoin held in reserve.  The Wormhole integration will allow tBTC to be transferred to both Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains, such as Arbitrum, Optimism and Polygon, and non-EVM chains like Solana, Aptos, Sui, and Cosmos.  Using bitcoin on other networks previously required users to rely on centralized bridges, which increased risks for token holders. Bridges are blockchain-based tools that allow the transfer of tokens between different networks – a mechanism that opened up massive security risks and fell victim to billions of dollars worth of exploits in 2022.  The Wormhole bridging plan relies upon a new method for bridging ERC-20 tokens that allows the efficient deployment of capital to Ethereum sidechains.  Instead of creating wrapped tokens for each chain, which soak up valuable liquidity that could be used elsewhere, tBTC will be minted on Ethereum.  A canonical token – i.e. one that is native to an ecosystem rather than wrapped – will then be deployed for each new chain. This way, the tBTC supply remains intact and risk is corralled in local ecosystems.  “Wrapped Bitcoin has historically had a problem of centralization risk that has prevented strong, safe adoption of BTC in on-chain DeFi,” explained Wormhole Core Contributor Robinson Burkey in a note to CoinDesk.  It is also expected that the collaboration will involve the Threshold DAO launching a cross-chain liquidity bootstrapping operation with the potential to attract up to 26,000 BTC of deposits, a representative told CoinDesk over Telegram message.  Experienced liquidity providers will seed tBTC liquidity in important ecosystems in exchange for the option to purchase approximately $20 million worth of Threshold’s native t (T) tokens at or above the spot price.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | APT | ARB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/11/threshold-network-goes-live-with-wormhole-to-bridge-bitcoin-to-20-blockchains,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b6f3fdb241f6ebb1524148b0bfedefe5be5e0b7c-5333x3000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

12535540,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=531226,1683810020,Chiliz (CHZ) Price Nosedives Indicating A Strong Bearish Sentiment,"Chiliz(CHZ) is trading in the red today, down by over 4% in the last 24 hours. This trend broadly reflects the global crypto market cap, down by 0.57% in 24 hours. However, despite the price drop, Chiliz’s trading volume is up by 39% at press time, which could influence its price action soon. CHZ traded at $0.1011 on January 1, 2023, before it moved to $0.1202 on January 10. Since then, it has experienced extreme price volatility, peaking at $0.1577 on February 8 for the first time in 2023. However, the bears have prevailed on its price, returning it to $0.1075 today. CHZ Price Prediction CHZ is in a downtrend momentum, forming a fourth consecutive red candle. It has dropped below its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), a bearish sentiment for the short and long term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Blasts Above $28,000 Following 4.9% April CPI Report Also, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 28.15, firmly in the oversold region below 30. It implies that the bears are in control of their price movement. The RSI is still moving downwards, suggesting further price decline for the asset in the short term. However, since the asset is oversold, a retracement is likely if it can rally from its closest support level. CHZ’s Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is below its signal line and showing negative values. It also reflects the prevalent bearish trend. Also, the histogram bars are at full strength and bearish. CHZ is rapidly approaching the $0.108 support level and a drop below this will send the asset’s price into free fall to record lower lows. Related Reading: Bitcoin Funding Rates On BitMEX Turn Deep Red, Here’s Why This Is Bullish The bears at the $0.11685719 resistance level are active and resisting a rally for the asset. But CHZ is already in the oversold region and will probably reach a point of consolidation soon.

The funding round valued the firm at $250 million and was led by Blockchange Ventures with the participation of firms including Rubik Ventures, Node Capital and FalconX, according to an emailed announcement on Thursday.  Odsy Foundation, a Zug, Switzerland-based organization working to promote the network's adoption, said its goal is to ""decentralize access control in Web3,"" to mitigate the requirement for users to have multiple wallets to access different networks and applications, thereby removing an obstacle to wider adoption.  ""Just as each internet account requires a log-in, each blockchain requires a different wallet – and the tracking and maintenance of different wallets present a significant challenge and headache for users,"" Blockchange Ventures general partner Ken Seiff said. ""This challenge will only grow as the number of blockchain networks multiply.""  Odsy's decentralized wallets (dWallets) are designed to provide access to different Web3 protocols and platforms through ""transferable signing mechanisms"" on the Odsy Network with the ability to sign transactions on ""practically any other blockchain.""  Among the firms building on Odsy is dWallet Labs, a firm providing blockchain security for other Odsy-based projects, which raised $5 million in August in a round led by Node Capital and CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group.

The company, which is U.S.-qualified through its entity Aegis Trust, said in a press release on Thursday that the initiative is aimed at supporting the growth of women-led crypto companies and promoting gender parity in a historically male-dominated space. Qualifying companies can receive six months of free custody services, worth a total of $28,000, regardless of their size or stage of development.  ""This frees up resources to allow these companies to focus on growth and building innovative products and services without worrying about the expenses associated with custody services,"" the company said in a statement.  Serra Wei, CEO and founder of Aegis Custody, was inspired to provide end-to-end custody and security services to other women after reflecting on the challenges she faced in Web3. ""As a female founder, I am acutely aware of the lack of community and support for female-led crypto companies in the industry,"" said Wei.  She told CoinDesk that other initiatives, like CoinDesk discounting tickets for women at its annual Consensus conference, highlighted the need for continued efforts to bring more women into Web3. ""It's evident that there's a significant lack of women in the industry, but we can bring about change by leveling the playing field,"" she said.  ""Women in the crypto industry often face an uphill battle to receive the same level of support and respect as their male counterparts,"" she continued. ""These obstacles can be incredibly discouraging and demotivating, making it even harder for women to succeed in the industry.""  She said that those interested in onboarding more women into Web3 should focus on ""donating services, time or knowledge.""  ""In the long run, supporting women-led businesses and fostering a culture of collaboration can help to create a stronger and more resilient crypto industry,"" she said.  The Web3 digital asset custodian has been expanding its offerings in recent months, announcing a $25 million insurance policy for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) held by institutional investors, hedge funds and exchanges. The custodian covers over 4,000 cryptocurrencies, NFTs and blockchain-based tokens, and also offers services like staking, DeFi governance, KYC and AML.

The token made its debut on the decentralized exchange Uniswap on May 4, and within just 48 hours, it was listed on CoinW and Toobit. This lightning-fast listing process is in stark contrast to PepeCoin (PEPE), which took three weeks to list on its first centralized exchange. In fact, following its listings on various exchanges, SPONGE came incredibly close to reaching a $100 million market cap, and was ranked in the top 275 cryptocurrencies by market cap, according to CoinMarketCap data. One impressive feat that SPONGE achieved was its trading volume on Uniswap. Within just four days of its launch, its 24-hour trading volume exceeded $100 million, outpacing the trading volume of PEPE by a significant margin. This made SPONGE the most-traded coin on Uniswap, excluding wrapped Ethereum. With such impressive numbers, many are wondering if SPONGE will be able to surpass the success of its meme coin rival, Pepe Coin. BTCUSD retreating from crucial $27,500 level.

In recent months, these tokens have gained immense popularity among traders and investors, with many hoping to strike it rich with the next big meme currency. The success of meme coins like SPONGE and Pepe Coin is a reminder that the crypto market is not solely driven by technology and fundamental analysis. Rather, it is a reflection of human behavior and sentiment, which can be just as unpredictable and volatile as the market itself. As the meme coin mania continues to sweep the crypto market, it will be interesting to see which tokens rise to the top and which fall by the wayside. -Featured image from Business 2 Community",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | ICO | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/sponge-lists-on-2-major-exchanges/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

Revenue fell 13% from the previous quarter, missing analyst expectations of C$21.2 million. The Toronto-based company reported earnings per share (EPS) of C$0.47 compared with forecasts for a loss of C$0.15 on FactSet.  While the crypto mining industry is starting to emerge from a brutal crypto winter that saw major names like Compute North and Core Scientific (CORZ) file for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, Hut 8 had to turn off about 8,000 machines in its Ontario facility due to a dispute with its energy provider in mid-November. Since then, it has managed to bring only about 1,000 back online.  On top of that, its facility at Drumheller, Alberta is operating at just 15% capacity due to electrical problems that have damaged the equipment. The site likely accounts for about 0.9 EH/s of Hut 8’s total 2.6 EH/s of computing power.  Hut 8 stock was little changed in pre-market trading on the Nasdaq, down 0.55% at $1.82 at the time of writing. The shares have more than doubled in price in 2023, but remain lower by 34% on a year-over-year basis.  Hut 8 is in the process of a merging with U.S. Bitcoin Corp.

However, XRP investors have yet another damper to digest today. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said during the Dubai Fintech Summit that he expects a ruling in the legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by the end of the third quarter of 2023. In a previous statement in January at the World Economic Forum, Garlinghouse still expressed his optimism that a ruling will come in the first half of 2023 (by the end of the second quarter). Ripple CEO Lowers His Expectations For A Verdict During the interview at the Dubai Fintech Summit, the Ripple CEO emphasized the protracted nature of the legal battle with the SEC, stressing that the case has been ongoing for two and a half years. While this is a long time, Garlinghouse pointed to a silver lining: So it has certainly been frustrating and slow, But the good news is we are at the end of that journey. While others in the crypto might be beginning their journey, the silver lining is that Ripple is now at the end. Furthermore, Garlinghouse revealed that he “expects a resolution in the next two or six months.” The Ripple CEO conceded Judge Analisa Torres has additional deliberation time, as she has extensive information to process and make a decision based on it. Related Reading: Whales Move Significant Chunk Of XRP Tokens As Price Trends Sideways Ultimately, Garlinghouse indicated that, like everyone else, he can only guess how long Judge will need to make her decision: A federal judge can operate on whatever timeline, in this case, she would like, but I am optimistic we can see a resolution, I believe, before the end of Q3. XRP Price Holds Key Support The XRP price is following the current market sentiment today and is slightly in the red today, down -0.34% over the last 24 hours. At press time, XRP was trading at $0.4253, holding above key support at $0.4131. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Ripple Plunges to $0.42: Can Bulls Save the Day? The support is key because a break to the downside would knock the XRP price back down the trading range from early November 2022 to mid-March 2023. XRP had spent over four months in this trading range before an impulsive move higher on March 21. If XRP closes below $0.4131 on the 1-day chart, it would be an extremely bearish signal. On the upside, XRP first faces the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.4353 again. The indicator is often referred to as the “bull boundary” and is accordingly of great importance to subsequently break through resistance at $0.4402 and regaining bullish momentum.

Blockchain analytics firm Glassnode's long-term holder net position change indicator, which tracks the 30-day change in the net amount of BTC entering or exiting exchange wallets that tend to hold coins for over six months, flipped positive in early April and has surged in the past four weeks.  The feature image shows net accumulation is currently happening at the fastest pace since October 2021. That indicates that investors view bitcoin's recent weakness as a typical bull market breather.  ""Long-term BTC holders are adding to their positions, implying that investors view the recent pause in price movement as an opportunity to acquire more,"" Q9 Capital, a crypto investment platform, said in an email, referring to the surge in the net position change metric.  Glassnode defines long-term holders as wallets holding onto their coins for at least 155 days without selling or moving them.  Bitcoin crossed above $31,000 on April 14, hitting the highest since June 2022, per CoinDesk data. Since then, the cryptocurrency's price has dropped by 12% to $27,500, while Nasdaq has risen by over 2% since mid-April. The Nasdaq-to-S&P 500 ratio, which bitcoin has closely followed in the past, has also increased by over 2% during that time period.  The divergence is a cause of concern for bitcoin bulls, according to Matrixport's Research and Strategy Head Markus Thielen.  ""Based on the relationship with tech stocks (Nasdaq), Bitcoin should now have been above $30,000, and the fact that this is not the case should caution any short-term traders,"" Thielen said in a note to clients. ""This decoupling could start a more significant divergence between the two.""  ""Many equity investors have expected that a U.S. recession was imminent, only to be disappointed as tech stocks continue to rally. Those shorts need to be covered.

42410790,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdhFU3,1683801603,"EU Could Veto Large Stablecoins During MiCA Approval Process, Regulator Signals","Central banks should veto large stablecoins if they have fears they could upend monetary policy, the chair of the European Banking Authority (EBA) has said, citing fears that the use of permissionless blockchains could prove financially unsound.  EBA Chairperson José Manuel Campa will in the coming months be setting out the detailed rules to implement the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA), a landmark framework that will require stablecoin issuers to gain a license and hold suitable reserves.  “Central banks should have the power to veto the widespread introduction of so-called stablecoins” if they affect public policy goals, including financial stability or monetary policy, Campa said at an event hosted by think tank OMFIF on Thursday. Campa's agency will also be responsible for directly supervising major issuers under MiCA.  MiCA lets central banks intervene on proposals to issue new stablecoins, referred to in MiCA as asset-referenced tokens. It also requires issuance to cease if the tokens become widely used with over 1 million transactions per day. Different rules apply for stablecoins tied to the value of a single fiat currency, known as e-money tokens.  Campa said he could see a future where stablecoins will “become even more relevant” as a means of payment, just as private payment systems now complement central bank money – but stressed they would have to comply with “sensible guardrails,” including respecting anti-money laundering laws.  In answer to a further question from former U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Timothy Massad, Campa also appeared to share concerns voiced by the U.S. central bank, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency that stablecoins on decentralized, permissionless blockchains could prove unsafe or unsound.  EU stablecoin issuers “have to ask for permission… you have to put forward your project and that project has to be assessed, particularly for the concerns that have been put forward by the U.S. regulators,” Campa said, adding that scrutiny would be greater on more ambitious projects.  “All issuers will be subject to a robust authorization and also supervisory framework going forward,” Campa said, including of prudential governance, conduct of business and redemption arrangements, with the largest issuers facing “enhanced stress testing” of their reserves.  MiCA is set to receive final sign-off from finance ministers next week, and its provisions will likely take effect around July 2024. Major players such as Circle and Unstoppable Finance have already announced their intention to issue stablecoins under MiCA.

12530414,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=531152,1683795655,"Whales Keep Buying Bitcoin, What They Might Know That You Don’t","The Bitcoin price took a major hit yesterday despite a positive surprise in the US Consumer Price Index (CPI), following a rumor that the US government sold 9,800 BTC related to Silk Road. Since then, the market has struggled to recover from the shock. However, one group of investors is showing no fear: whales. The big investors with a lot of money are considered one of the most reliable indicators of when is a good time to buy Bitcoin. On-Chain analyst Axel Adler stated, “BTC Accumulation and Distribution – no changes. Large players continue to buy BTC from smaller players.” The chart below shows that investors with more than 5,000 BTC have been buying large amounts (alongside smaller investors <10 BTC) over the last 30 and 90 days, while all other cohorts have been shedding BTC. What Do Bitcoin Whales Know? Of course, it can only be speculated what the Bitcoin whales know that others do not. But the fact is that Bitcoin saw an upward trend yesterday after the CPI release, until the fake news (manipulation?) about the US government selling Bitcoin broke. But, yesterday’s CPI print could have significantly more implications than are apparent at first glance. For some time now, the market has been betting on an early pivot by the U.S. central bank (Fed). The market is currently betting on three interest rate cuts by the end of the year (3x 25 bps to 4.25-4.50%). Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Blasts Above $28,000 Following 4.9% April CPI Report While the U.S. banking crisis reinforces this bet, whales may have been calling the Fed’s bluff for some time. As NewsBTC editorial director and technical analyst Tony Spilotro recently pointed out via Twitter, the Fed (and the masses) are relying on lagging indicators. Remember: CPI is a lagging indicator. The stock market is a leading indicator. — Tony ""The Bull"" (@tonythebullBTC) May 10, 2023 Charlie Bilello, chief market strategist at Creative Planning, stressed on Twitter that the consumer price index in the U.S. has declined from a high of 9.1% in June last year to 4.9% in April. According to the renowned analyst, the reason for this decrease is the lower inflation rates in heating oil, gasoline, used cars, gas supply, medical care, clothing, new cars, food at home and electricity. Inflation rates in transportation, out-of-home food and lodging have increased since last June, but declines in the other major components have offset those increases. The fact that the U.S. core inflation index (excluding food/energy) still stands at 5.5% year-over-year is primarily due to shelter CPI (+8.1% year-over-year), according to Bilello: Why was Shelter CPI still moving higher while actual rent inflation has been moving lower for some time? Shelter CPI is a lagging indicator that wildly understated true housing inflation in 2021 & first half of 2022. As Biello added, after 25 consecutive increases (on an annual basis), the shelter CPI showed its first decline in April, from 8.2% in March (the highest level since 1982) to 8.1% in April. If shelter inflation finally peaks, it will have a big impact on the overall CPI, as shelter accounts for more than one-third of the index. Deflation Coming Fast? This opinion is echoed by Fundstrat’s head of research, Thomas Lee. In an interview, Lee said that inflation will come down faster than most people think and that will make the Fed’s pause more comfortable for investors because it will lead to a soft landing. Related Reading: Bitcoin Funding Rates On BitMEX Turn Deep Red, Here’s Why This Is Bullish For Lee, this is one of the key implications of yesterday’s April CPI report. Carl Quintanilla of Fundstrat added: 40% of the CPI basket (by weight) is in outright deflation. This is a huge development. Housing and Food are not ‘deflating’ even though real-time measures show this. That would add another 50% or so when they do. For Bitcoin, a rapid drop in inflation rates and a soft landing as predicted by Lee could be extremely bullish. Whales could use this phase to accumulate while retail investors are selling out of fear of a looming recession with high inflation. At press time, the Bitcoin price traded at 27,550, back in the lower range.

42410801,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdhFrC,1683794448,"Developers Deploy Uniswap Contracts on Bitcoin as BRC20-Based SHIB, PEPE Gain Popularity","A group of developers have deployed Uniswap’s smart contracts onto the Bitcoin network to capitalize on the rise of BRC-20 tokens and develop the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.  Called Trustless Market, the protocol has racked up daily volumes of $500,000, attracted over 2,000 users, and lets liquidity providers earn a 2% cut on all swaps conducted on the network.  Although most of these tokens are meme coins, instead of tokens that may be used in a sophisticated DeFi application built on Bitcoin, it still counts as a start.  “We want to make Bitcoin as generalized as possible — usable for far more than just a currency,” said @punk3700, one of the developers at Trustless Market, in a Twitter message. “We started first with Art, then AI, and DeFi is the natural next area to add.”  “It's still super early. Feels like Uniswap in 2018. But it's fun,” @punk3700 said.  DeFi relies on automated smart contracts to provide financial services, such as lending and borrowing, to users. Nearly $47 billion worth of tokens are locked on such protocols, DefiLlama data shows.  Bitcoin’s usage in DeFi applications was so far limited to tokenized representations of bitcoin on other chains, such as Ethereum or Solana. However, the recent introduction of “Bitcoin Recent for Comment” token standards allows developers to issue tokens – and DeFi applications – natively on Bitcoin – which has spurred a collection of digital artwork and meme tokens built on Bitcoin in recent weeks.  Data from OrdSpace, which tracks BRC-20 data, shows over 11,000 tokens issued on Bitcoin are available on the open market as of Monday with a cumulative market capitalization of $500 million, down from a $1.5 billion figure earlier this week.  So far, tokens of Ordinals marketplace Ordi (ORDI) are the most valued BRC-20 tokens with a market capitalization of $400 million and 8,300 unique ordi token holders. Ordi is said to be the first BRC-20 token deployed on Bitcoin, which may also be aiding its value proposition among holders.  Pepe tokens (PEPE) on Bitcoin – different from the ones issued on Ethereum – are the third-largest BRC-20 issuance, albeit with a relatively tinier $17 million market capitalization. There’s also Bitcoin’s own shiba inu (SHIB) iteration at a $3.7 million capitalization – a mere smidge compared to the original SHIB on Ethereum, which boasts a $5.5 billion capitalization.  As such, Trustless Market is one of the few protocols in a rising cohort that seeks to develop the Bitcoin ecosystem – a move that has sent transactional fees spiking.  Bitcoin users paid over $17.42 million in fees over the past 24 hours, marking the second highest day ever in gas fees, analytics tool DefiLlama tweeted Thursday.  But the likes of @punk3700 say that the fee problem is a stepping stone to fuel adoption in the long term.  “I think that's a good problem to have actually!” @punk3700 said. “Always think the use cases/utilities are going to come first. The infrastructure upgrade will then follow.”",POSITIVE,SHIB | PEPE,BTC | MARKET | SHIB | UNI | PEPE,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/11/developers-deploy-uniswap-contracts-on-bitcoin-as-brc20-based-shib-pepe-gain-popularity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/37775596a1aaefe587b561f092c0abbb2ce188cb-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410782,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdhF3b,1683793692,Bitcoin Miner Marathon First-Quarter Earnings Beat Estimates as SEC Extends Probe,"Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), one of the largest publicly traded crypto miners in North America, reported a narrower-than-forecast first-quarter loss per share as a rising bitcoin price and increased production helped lift the Las Vegas-based company back toward profitability.  The company also said it received another subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is looking into related-party transactions, among other things, that may have violated federal securities law. The company said it is cooperating with the investigation.  Marathon posted a net loss of $0.05 per share compared with an average estimate of $0.08 according to FactSet data. The loss narrowed from the previous quarter, when it was $3.14, as well as the same period in 2022, when it was $0.12, according to a Wednesday filing. Revenue rose to $51.1 million from $28.4 million in the previous three months. The figure was little changed from the year-earlier period. Analysts had forecast revenue of $48.8 million for the quarter.  After facing construction and operational hurdles last year, including the bankruptcy of one of its hosting partners – Compute North, Marathon has increased production. The firm’s operational hashrate increased 64% quarter on quarter to 11.5 exahash/second (EH/s), with bitcoin production hitting a record of BTC 2,195 ($80 million) in the quarter. The price of bitcoin surged more than 70% in the first quarter.  “After weathering a tumultuous 2022 that tested the resilience of our entire industry, this year is off to a strong start as we grew our hashrate, reduced our cost to mine, and improved our balance sheet during the first quarter,” Chairman and CEO Fred Thiel said in the statement.  Marathon shares fell more than 2% in pre-market Nasdaq trading on Thursday.  The SEC subpoena follows an earlier one regarding the issuance of 6 million shares of common stock related to its Hardin, Montana facility.  The company is working on expanding its operations into the Middle East. This week, it announced a joint venture with an investment firm backed by Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund for a 200 megawatt (MW) immersion-cooled facility in the emirate.  Along with other miners, Marathon sold almost all of its mined bitcoin in February, ending a long-time strategy to hold onto its production.  It has also worked to reduce debt levels, which were among the highest of publicly traded miners. In March, it terminated a credit facility with Silvergate Bank after earlier paying $30 million to the now-defunct bank.

The pair could start a decent increase if it clears the $0.380 resistance zone. Cardano’s ADA Price Extends Decline This past week, Cardano’s price made a couple of attempts to clear the $0.400 resistance. However, the bulls failed and the price reacted to the downside below the $0.388 support. The price declined below the $0.380 and $0.365 support levels. Finally, it tested the $0.355 support.

After a significant drop in the crypto market traders are hunting for profits by focussing on jokes instead of fundamental plays, which has contributed toward extremely large gas fees on the Ethereum blockchain.  Last week saw trading volume on meme coins jump to $2.3 billion, more than six times higher than the week prior, and the highest level since May 2021, Coinbase said in the newsletter.  The newsletter noted that the ongoing meme coin mania was led by the rise of PEPE, which has grown nearly 55,000% since its issuance in mid-April – running to a $1.8 billion market capitalization in just under three weeks to become one of the fastest-growing tokens of all time.  Read more: Crypto Whales Accumulate Millions in Pepecoin as Trading Volume Shifts to Binance  It also tracked the growth of Bitcoin-based meme coins following the introduction of the Bitcoin Request for Comment (BRC-20) token standard, which allows developers to issue tokens directly on the Bitcoin blockchain.  However, most of these tokens turned out to be meme coins and reached a cumulative market capitalization of $1.8 billion earlier this week.  Pepe meme's use by political groups  However, the newsletter riled up some Crypto Twitter community members by pointing out that the Pepe the Frog meme that serves as the mascot for pepecoin has been used in racist ways on the internet.  “The token is based on the Pepe the Frog meme, which first surfaced on the internet nearly 20 years ago as a comic-strip character,” the Coinbase newsletter said. “Over time it has been co-opted as a hate symbol by alt-right groups, according to the Anti-Defamation League.”  Although the newsletter has a disclaimer that distances its author and does “not necessarily reflect the views of Coinbase or its employees,” the sentence became the centerpiece of Crypto Twitter commentary.  The Anti-Defamation League notes that although the meme has proliferated on controversial internet forums 4chan and 8chan, both of which are associated with alt-right politics, ""the majority of uses of Pepe the Frog have been, and continue to be, non-bigoted,"" it states on the ADL website.  Pepe community fumes  “$pepe is not a hate symbol!,” tweeted one @Pauly0x, a prominent PEPE supporter.  “I will be closing my personal and business accounts with @Coinbase and moving them to @Gemini. #PEPE IS NOT A SYMBOL OF HATE,” tweeted @OG_Kenobi_Hello, another PEPE supporter.  “The $pepe movement is about love, equity, & a protest against VC-backed entities/influencers that have been criminally taking advantage of the web3 community for the past 2 years,” @OG_Kenobi_Hello further added.

Despite a strong push from the bulls to drive the coin’s price higher from the $320-$325 region, the bears took over and sent the price tumbling down. Now, BNB is looking to find support around the $300 mark as the market remains volatile. As one of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, Binance Coin has been a favorite among traders and investors alike. However, the recent price action has left many wondering about the coin’s future prospects. While some analysts remain optimistic about the coin’s long-term potential, others are cautious and suggest that the current market conditions could lead to further downside for Binance Coin. Binance Coin Price Analysis Binance Coin’s price on CoinMarketCap stands at $312.46, with a slight dip of 0.29% in the past 24 hours. Unfortunately, this trend has persisted over the last seven days, with a decline of 4.35%, leaving investors anxious about the future direction of Binance Coin’s value. Source: CoinMarketCap Binance Coin’s value has been fluctuating between the $320 and $340 price points since its surge to $350 in mid-April. However, over the past few days, the lower trendline support has been breached by the coin’s price, indicating a bearish trend in the market. This breach was followed by a swift drop from $324 to $311, resulting in a loss of 4.39% in just 32 hours. Related Reading: Render (RNDR) Poised To Weather Market Storm With Solid AI Prospects The current market conditions suggest that bears are in control of the Binance Coin’s price, which is a cause for concern for investors. The $309 and $301 price levels have been significant support cushions since February. Binance Coin’s price movement analysis shows that the market remains volatile and unpredictable, leaving investors uncertain about the future direction of the coin’s value. How BNB Bulls Are Reacting Despite the recent bearish trend in the market, there is still hope for Binance Coin bulls to take control of the market and drive the coin’s value higher. The first step towards a bullish trend is to reclaim the $320 price point, which has acted as a resistance level in recent weeks. If bulls manage to push the price above this level, the next resistance point would be at $340.

12520328,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4602798-ethereum-the-frog-meme-moment?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1683767055,Ethereum: The Frog Meme Moment,"Summary The PEPE token launched on Ethereum in mid-April. PEPE is a ""memecoin"" that has already sucked in over 100k unique wallet addresses. Ethereum transaction fees have spiked as a result and lower value chain activity has once again been priced out of the market. Larger impacts could include migration to scaling chains or alternative Layer 1 ecosystems. There is a new coin on the Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) network that is causing quite a bit of chaos within crypto. PEPE (PEPE-USD) is the latest ""memecoin"" to go wild and has mooned more than 4,000% since its launch in mid-April. This new coin claims to be the heir apparent to previous notable meme coins like Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) or SHIBA INU ( SHIB-USD ). From the PEPE website : the most memeable memecoin in existence. The dogs have had their day, it’s time for Pepe to take reign. The roadmap is vague. The tokenomics are non-existent. The performance of PEPE is either a cycle top indicator, an exit liquidity attempt of some sort, or a sign that crypto market players are bored; possibly a mix of all three. PEPE Activity There are 420.69 trillion PEPE coins in existence and the indiscriminate buying launched PEPE to a $1.7 billion market cap high on May 5th. In less than a month after having launched the coin, PEPE has already surpassed 144k unique wallet address holders and 848k transactions: PEPE Holder Trend (Dune Analytics/wuligy) Even when accounting for the high likelihood of wash trading, PEPE volume has transacted well over $1 billion in ""real volume"" according to data from Messari. This surge in PEPE chasing has had consequences on the Ethereum blockchain. The Impact on Ethereum Regardless of what ultimately happens with this new joke crypto coin, the reason PEPE is significant is because of what has happened to Ethereum gas since the coin's launch last month: Daily Median ETH Gas (Dune Analytics/hildobby) In the weeks leading up to the PEPE launch, the median gas price on Ethereum generally oscillated between 20-40 gwei. That average spiked to 142 gwei on May 5th and has remained above 100 gwei since. In dollar terms, this has created an environment where token swaps on the main layer are now five times more expensive than they were in mid-April: Avg tx fees (Messari) On April 15th, the average transaction fee on Ethereum was $5.66. On May 5th, the average transaction fee hit $27.61. This means swapping from one ERC-20 token on chain to another can cost as much as $60 per transaction. These higher fees on Ethereum's main layer are one of the core reasons why alternative Layer 1 smart contract chains exist. Cardano ( ADA-USD ), Solana ( SOL-USD ), and Cosmos ( ATOM-USD ) had bull moments in 2021 in part because the NFT craze made building DeFi protocols on Ethereum so cost prohibitive for smaller value transactions. This is detrimental for most users. Alternative Chain Activity For Ethereum, the proliferation of layer 2 scaling chains was already a big driver of Ethereum ecosystem growth in 2022. If base layer transactions fees remain elevated on Ethereum, it could impact the broader crypto environment a couple different ways. First, it could push more of the activity to layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum ( ARB-USD ) or Optimism ( OP-USD ). DAU Trend (Token Terminal) So far, that usage hasn't been impacted to a significant degree by the PEPE meme lords. Arbitrum usage is still trending higher though we haven't seen a noticeable spike in the weekly DAUs trend from Optimism or Polygon's ( MATIC-USD ) proof of stake chain. These networks still require Ethereum for security and as the average transaction fees on Ethereum rise, the cost to secure the scaling chains will rise as well. L2 Fees % of Total (L2fees.info) What we have seen is the cost to secure those chains as a percentage of total Ethereum fees has trended down from over 6% in April to under 4% in May. The more that percentage goes down, the more attractive it becomes to use scaling chains rather than the base layer. The other possibility crypto investors should consider is that high Ethereum fees could once again push users to other Layer 1 ecosystems entirely. So far, we're seeing a surge in DAUs this month in several alternative chains: Average DAUs April May Change Solana ( SOL-USD ) 125,087 255,992 104.7% Flow ( FLOW-USD ) 31,908 114,446 258.7% FantomCoin ( FTM-USD ) 42,261 59,302 40.3% Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ) 39,640 41,136 3.8% Cosmos Hub ( ATOM-USD ) 18,003 24,581 36.5% MultiversX ( EGLD-USD ) 14,916 14,016 -6.0% Source: Token Terminal Two notable stand outs since the launch of PEPE appear to be Solana and Flow. Solana has seen daily active users double in May over April and Flow has seen more than triple the DAUs over the prior month. Additional considerations But beyond just making scaling chains and alternative chains more attractive for everyday usage, one of the other things to consider from this spike in Ethereum transaction fees is the impact this kind of activity has on total ETH supply: ETH Supply (Ultrasound.money) Nearly 202k ETH has been burned since ""The Merge"" last September. 120k of that 202k ETH has been burned in the last 30 days and 64K of it has come in the last week alone. This fee burn mechanism is a result of EIP-1559 . The end result of this is ETH has become a deflationary crypto asset. Data by YCharts In the longer term, less supply of ETH could increase the price of the coin should the chain's level of activity remain constant or rise. Though it's too early to tell if that will indeed be the case. Risks Ethereum continues to be one of the most widely used blockchains in the entire crypto industry. But there is still quite a bit of regulatory uncertainty surrounding how it is viewed in the eyes of US regulators. The CFTC says it's a commodity. The SEC has hinted that it is a security. Ethereum is quickly becoming one of the battlefronts for US regulators that are fighting over jurisdictional authority. The idea that silly meme coins like PEPE can create such a large ripple effect that is theoretically detrimental to other utility of the chain is definitely something crypto investors should consider. Summary Much like Ordinals on Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) which is going through a very similar transaction fee event, the PEPE moment for Ethereum is showing again how quickly fees can make the network unusable on the base layer for most people. We saw a similar thing happen during the NFT craze of late 2021 and early 2022. For Ethereum, there is a possible feedback loop where ETH's price actually keeps going higher as more supply is burned. In my view, concerns about the sustainability of that are valid.",NEUTRAL,ETH | SOL | PEPE,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SOL | TRADING | PEPE,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4602798-ethereum-the-frog-meme-moment?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/12520328.jpeg

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  All Eyes on Ether as Bitcoin Pushes Down?  Good Morning Asia,  Crypto is starting the trading day in Asia fairly flat after a promising U.S. Consumer Price Index pushed bitcoin above $28,000.  Bitcoin is now trading at $27,618, according to CoinDesk market data, which makes it effectively flat. Ether is down 0.4% to $1,838.  Katie Stockton, Founder and Managing Partner of Fairlead Strategies, said during a recent appearance on CoinDesk TV that overall the crypto market likes the lower CPI numbers but don’t expect price appreciation yet.  “From a technical perspective, the market does seem to like it, we're seeing a positive reaction. But really, the action is somewhat insignificant in terms of where both bitcoin and Ether have traded up late,” she said. “They recently broke down below their 50-day moving averages.""  Stockton expects Bitcoin to pull back to its base breakout point of about $25,200. However, she still sees an upward trend in the intermediate term.  This lower price point should serve as a nice entry point for new investors, she argues.  Stockton also sees a short-term setback for Ether as it too, has moved out its 50-day moving average. However, she predicts Ether might outperform bitcoin in the short term.  ""We anticipate a downside for Ether, regardless of today's activity, with a support level around $1,755,” she said. “This could provide a natural point for stabilization as oversold conditions may yield a rebound.""

Inflation hedge? Gold alternative?  Bitcoin has yet to find a new foundation that drives the price from its weeks-long range roughly between $25,000 and $30,000, Brent Xu, CEO and co-founder of Web3 bond-market platform Umee, said on CoinDesk TV’s “All About Bitcoin” program.  “Bitcoin is trying to find its next narrative,” Xu said.  Bitcoin’s price seesawing on Wednesday encapsulated its vulnerability to events in recent weeks. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose on a mildly favorable Consumer Price Index (CPI) that showed inflation rising a less-than-expected 4.9% in April. But BTC sank around midday on internet rumors of a $320 million U.S. government bitcoin sell-off before rebounding as markets shrugged off the hearsay.  Xu noted that the price run-ups tied to a mini-run of U.S. bank failures in April and earlier this month had failed to spur long-lasting price momentum.  “We saw a bunch of banks get destroyed, and there's this narrative building that bitcoin will be a new banking system,” he said. “Unfortunately, that narrative is still not fully substantiated.Bitcoin is oscillating during the existing market cycles, and we haven't reached that bullish momentum cycle yet.  He added: That is likely to happen next year. For the rest of this year, we're gonna see some more price oscillation.”  Xu believes that the steady decline in inflation from a peak of 9.1% last June will allow the U.S. central bank to reconsider the steady diet of hawkish interest rate increases that Federal Reserve critics blame for the near banking meltdown and other economic ills. “There's a likelihood that we're going to see some potential cuts,” Xu said, adding that some analysts foresee interest rate cuts totaling 75 basis points (bps) in the months ahead.  “They need to take a long hard look at what all these interest rates hikes have been doing, and just the possibility of a deeper recession into the near future,” he said.  Xu said that liquidity would be important for crypto markets to thrive. Market makers Jane Street and Jump Crypto recently abandoned crypto trading in the U.S. and other firms focused or with at least a deep interest in crypto have also been scaling back their activities or threatening to move them overseas.  But Xu said that “these markets will find a way to exist, if not within U.S. borders,” and added that “there will be institutional liquidity that comes in.”  “It’s just building the right narrative. The next narrative needs to be a major innovation, like the Shanghai Shapella upgrade, or some sort of new L-2 (layer 2), or some major improvement to the bitcoin blockchain. And when we see those, we'll see more liquidity and action coming (into markets).”  Important events.  9:30 a.m. HKT/SGT(1:30 UTC) Chinese Consumer Price Index (YoY/April)  7:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(11:00 UTC) Bank of England Monetary Policy Report  8:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(12:30 UTC) United States Producer Price Index ex Food & Energy (YoY/April)  CoinDesk TV  In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:  Bitcoin Inches Higher After April Inflation Report; Congress's Joint Crypto Regulation Hearing  Bitcoin (BTC) was inching higher after the annual U.S. inflation rate slowed to 4.9% in April from 5.0% in March, versus economist forecasts for 5.0%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
