42397270,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaoC8j,1382634011,Software firm buys Africa's largest bitcoin exchange,"South Africa-based bitcoin software firm Switchless has purchased the largest bitcoin exchange on the continent for an undisclosed sum.  Switchless  , which is based in Stellenbosch, snapped up BitX less than a year after the exchange was founded. According to Switchless director Marcus Swanepoel, his company bought the exchange, which is also based in Stellenbosch, for its team in what he described as an ""aqui-hire"" deal.  BitX’s team consists of three people, one of whom is former Google engineer Timothy Stranex, who co-founded the firm in February. The team brings Switchless’s total staff to eight.  Swanepoel is secretive about the exact nature of his firm's business, other than to say it develops bitcoin software for financial institutions. One of its investors is incubator FireID, which is also based in Stellenbosch.  ""It relates to exchange type of software, and ways to keep your bitcoins safe, like wallets,"" says Swanepoel of his product. ""The strategy of the firm is to continue investing in building that out to other financial institutions."" BitX says on its website that it is powered by Switchless enterprise bitcoin software.  Given BitX’s position as the best-known exchange for bitcoins in Africa, the firm's trading volume (around 10 BTC each day, according to Swanepoel) is surprisingly low. But Swanepoel puts that down to the unique nature of bitcoin trading in the African market. He said:    ""There are a lot of other exchanges going on in Africa that aren't necessarily done online. There are people meeting up in Zimbabwe.      To size the overall market is pretty difficult, and obviously it won't be as big as Germany and the US, because it is just starting up.""    While volumes are low at present, Swanepoel believes that it could take off and grow dramatically in a short time period. One thing that may help here is the relatively large number of ""un-banked"" people on the continent.  ""The big problem in Africa is moving money across borders, and we don't see that being solved very quickly, but at least it could be a lot cheaper and more efficient than it is at this stage,"" Swanepoel said, adding that bitcoin could play a big part in solving the global remittance problem. There are two issues: people moving money within Africa, and foreign workers trying to send money home.  Safaricom’s M-PESA digital cash system has already garnered over 14 million active users, and Switchless hopes that bitcoin will also gain traction in the country because it offers similar advantages.  Many people in Africa don't have a computer connected to broadband Internet. In fact, data aggregated by Credit Suisse suggests that PC penetration per capita in the Middle East and Africa is projected to reach just 7%, compared to 50% in Western Europe.  However, mobile penetration forecasts are far higher, with a 114% projected penetration rate for mobile subscribers in the Middle East and Africa.  When rates exceed 100%, it means that there are more mobile subscriptions than people, which sounds counterintuitive but which is becoming fairly common in many countries, thanks to a combination of more than one device per person, and business-focused, machine-to-machine connections.  Most of these phones will be feature phones, however; smart phone subscription rates will be a measly 9% in the region, compared to 100% in Western Europe.  Those figures include the Middle East. The African continent alone will see a 63% penetration rate for mobile-cellular across the African continent this year, according to the ITU.  Even phones without a data plan can still be used to send mobile cash, however, thanks to SMS-based messaging (such services are already supported in North America). However, BitX isn't catering to this market, and will be unlikely to do so in the short term, said Swanepoel.  ""BitX will run as it is right now, although we will have some clients that come into the mobile space at some stage,” he concluded.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/10/24/software-firm-buys-africas-largest-bitcoin-exchange,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/594e8e83f46925b9de76f233129c0a76794dcbd1-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397272,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaoC9i,1382625009,Swedish bank freezes customer's account after she sells 5 BTC,"Swedbank recently froze a customer's account after it found out about her selling five bitcoins on a digital currency marketplace.  The customer, who asked not to be named, said the Swedish bank froze her account a few days after she sold her bitcoins on LocalBitcoins.com.  ""I sold the bitcoins on 4th September 2013. I could see that the money had been deposited into my bank account. When I checked my account a few days later I could see that it was blocked and I couldn’t do any transactions on my account,"" she explained.  The customer went on to say she was particularly frustrated that the bank didn't try to contact her before freezing her account.  On 11th September, her account was still blocked, so she wrote to Swedbank to ask for an explanation. The bank responded a week later asking about the transaction she had made on LocalBitcoins.com.  ""Then a guy from the bank called me. He didn’t say it in so many words, but in between the lines he advised me against doing business in bitcoins because of its anonymity. After his call I felt a bit like a criminal,"" she said.  The bank reopened her account 15 days after they imposed the freeze.  A spokesperson from Swedbank said:    ""At present it is not prohibited for our customers to shop with bitcoins. However, each case is being considered individually.      Swedbank monitors the development regarding bitcoin as a recognized/approved currency.""    The customer doesn't think there is currently a very big appetite for bitcoin in Sweden. She said most people she speaks to about digital currency have heard about bitcoin, but that's as far as their knowledge and interest goes. ""Sometimes I get the feeling that it’s only me and my family who are bitcoin fans.""  She could be right – there are only a handful of people located in Sweden who are currently selling bitcoins on LocalBitcoins.com. However, Frank Schuil, CEO of Swedish exchange Safello, told CoinDesk earlier this week that ""innovation is embraced rather than rejected"" in the country so he believes bitcoin could yet flourish in Sweden.

42397284,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaoCIZ,1382618284,"How ""dumb mistakes"" can lead to costly bitcoin losses","It's great that bitcoin gives you the power to ""be your own bank"", with almost zero fees and full control over your finances. But even banks discover sometimes such power can backfire. Nothing can stop human error, technical glitches, human nature or a combination of all three from wreaking havoc on the balance sheet.  But bitcoin is also like a pocketful of cash. Like that time you shelled out $100 instead of $10, or two bills instead of one, a simple concentration lapse can see exponentially more bitcoin leave your wallet than you'd intended, never to be seen again.  The difference between bitcoin and cash, though, is that much larger amounts may be at stake. Cash transactions tend to be smaller, while (reputedly safer) credit cards and bank transfers handle larger ones. Bitcoin allows you not only to transfer a million dollars in a heartbeat, it gives you a chance to send it to the wrong place. Or nowhere at all.  Bitcoin regrets, in hindsight  Reddit has a thread on ""The dumbest mistake you've made with bitcoin"", full of stories about people who mined hundreds or more BTC in the early days only to trash the file or blow their potential fortune on frivolous purchases. SatoshiDice also plays a large role in causing regret, as do payments for still-unshipped mining hardware made when 1 BTC was $5.  Then there are all the usual caveats surrounding online wallets and escrow systems, and the level of trust you should place in them.  Coders, NASA scientists and traders understand the brutality typographical errors can unleash on a project. Bitcoin is equally unforgiving with its mostly anonymous, non-reversible transactions and decentralized structure. If teams sending rockets to Mars can slip up, what hope is there for the average bitcoin software developer or spender?  To your horror, you realize you forgot to toggle from BTC to mBTC before you sent the amount; fat-fingered an extra zero; or copy-pasted a completely different address string to the one you wanted. Perhaps someone just sent you a large payment directly to an address you no longer control or a paper wallet you misplaced somehow. Or you released software that pays out a 10 BTC transaction fee for each payment processed.  Power users and developers create their own raw transactions in bitcoin's Script language to create more esoteric transactions allowed by the protocol but not featured in most software wallets, such as escrow payments. This involves manually typing all transaction details into a command line, and all the associated risks.  Some solutions are appearing, like wallet software Electrum's raw transaction graphic front-end and brainwallet.org's web-based transaction builder. The latter assumes you trust an online service more than your ability to type error-free Script, and with both you'll still need to enter keys and transaction fees with care.  Manually assigning transaction fees also produces the occasional but inevitable expensive BTC blunder for software developers and a few others, as it did with this unfortunate account. Once confirmed, the transaction fee is distributed to multiple unknown miners who will never be able to provide a personal thank you for the generosity.  There's no customer support line to reach for. Sometimes, the most effective course of action is to broadcast news of the mistake as wide as possible on online forums and new aggregators, in the hope someone benevolent will come to your aid.  That's what happened in the case above, where a fellow reader contacted powerful mining pool BTC Guild. BTC Guild tracked and reimbursed a portion of the mistake, but 75% of the originator's total was shared out and 'lost' to the network.  The Bitcoin Talk forum and reddit are filled with stories of woe. An unknown but unlucky user sent out over 100 BTC in transaction fees over a 24-hour period in September.  The large spikes visible on this blockchain.info transaction fee chart likely resulted from human error. It should be noted that, as well as community sympathy, there is also a suspicion some large erroneous-looking transactions could be coinwashing (aka money-laundering) efforts in disguise.  Measures to prevent error  Mike Hearn, developer at the Bitcoin Foundation, says most loss-causing errors are the result of users not backing up locally-stored wallet files at the right time, and by misusing paper wallets. The excess fee issue, he says, is only a problem for software developers.  ""Right now the times when you need to make fresh backups aren't always obvious. I'm hoping that wallet authors will get better at pushing users to make backups as well – the Android app already does push users in the right direction, but I'd rather like to see automatic backups be made by default. Basically I think we can push users in the right direction much more strongly than is presently done,"" he said.  [post-quote]  ""Misusing paper wallets is related to that. Not all wallet software is designed to support paper wallets. People who don't understand this have managed to delete money before, by importing a private key that was exported, making a partial payment, then destroying the wallet – not realizing that the change didn't go back to the same key they imported.""  Many users may not be aware of the need for frequent wallet file backups. At present, wallets create private and public keys on demand, meaning regular backups are necessary to prevent loss. There is also the problem of maintaining multiple wallets on several devices.  The solution to this, due for future implementation, is 'hierarchical deterministic' (HD) wallets. This kind of wallet generates all keys from a single seed, meaning it can be backed up to hard copy just once and then retained. HD wallets also allow multiple devices to host the same wallet, staying in sync with each other.  As mentioned here previously, the bitcoin development team also hopes to add human-memorable address aliases and a messaging function to transactions. Messaging would allow users to include a refund address with transactions to make it easier for recipients to send them.  Be careful (and sometimes magnanimous)  ASICminer  CEO 'friedcat' was lauded in September 2013 for returning 200 BTC mistakenly sent to the company. He said the only thought to cross his mind was to refund the amount, as it shouldn't belong to anyone else. He also believes bitcoin software could do more to save users from themselves.  ""We shouldn't rely on voluntary refunds, especially in this irreversible transaction based currency. The software should give warnings and options to cancel the transaction before sending it to the network,"" he said.  As bitcoin grows far beyond the boundaries of its online communities, there's every chance recipients of mistaken largesse won't feel the need to reimburse as friedcat did. Sympathy towards the careless will drop. The sheer volume of future errors will make them less likely to be corrected, even in part.  Before computers had graphical user interfaces that popped up to warn you every time you clicked something meaningful, command lines would follow every mistyped directive without even a beep, even if it meant erasing vital system directories.  For now, bitcoin can be like those command lines and the best protection against your own bank becoming your own financial crisis is you.  Keep all your paper wallets in a safe place and backup your local wallet file regularly. Double check the recipient address and if the amount is enough to make you cry if lost, check it again. Check to make sure an insignificant amount doesn't become significant while you're distracted.  It's probably a good idea not to drink before playing SatoshiDice, too.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2013/10/24/how-dumb-mistakes-can-lead-to-costly-bitcoin-losses,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9134585356bb1d8116cb93f749e94c54efd20237-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397278,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaoCEd,1382606437,"Coinbase launches iOS app to buy, sell and send bitcoin","Bitcoin digital wallet and payment processor Coinbase has launched a mobile app platform for its services on Apple iOS devices. The app is now available in the Apple App Store for free and enables users to buy, sell and send bitcoins, plus manage their wallet.  Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam says that the company's new app is another tool that allows people to more easily spend bitcoin.  ""This was one more step in our mission to make bitcoin easier to use. Now that I have the iOS app, I use it to pay back my friends when I'm out and about since it's so much easier than other ways to do it,"" he said.  Coinbase has full US bank integration with bitcoin. Users can easily get verified with a bank account and phone number, then it is possible to move money in and out of BTC, and can have fiat in their bank account within a few days.  The Coinbase mobile app launch is just one of a number of announcements from the company in the past few months.  In July, the company announced instant bitcoin transactions for its verified customers. That followed with the creation of its SMS interface, allowing users to send bitcoin via text message. The company also recently said that it would waive for businesses any fees on the first $1m in transactions.  Ehrsam says one of Coinbase's big advantages is that it has special incentives to encourage its users to spend as well as introduce new people to the idea of bitcoin.  ""Every time you send someone new bitcoin and they end up buying or selling at least one bitcoin, you each get $5, so it turns the app into a great way to introduce new people to bitcoin,"" he explained.  Coinbase has raised over $6m in Series A funding this year from a group of investors that include Union Square Ventures, Ribbit Capital and others. Since its founding two years ago, it has gone through the Y Combinator incubator program to now being a six-person company located in San Francisco.  The Coinbase app is only the second application with bitcoin features approved in the Apple App Store. The other is Gliph, a messaging app that allows users to attach bitcoins to recipients. Gliph recently raised $200,000 from a group of investors that included Boost VC.  In addition to consumer-based bitcoin services, Coinbase's payment processing API is being used for a number of established companies and startups like Gliph.
