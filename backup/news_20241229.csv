BlockDAG Network launches its innovative $1M USDT New Year’s Raffle, while Ethereum gears up for a potential surge to $12,000. Ethereum’s appeal grows with its scalability improvements and the expansion of decentralized finance (DeFi), while BlockDAG captures the spotlight by mixing crypto bonuses with enticing raffle wins. BlockDAG’s strong presale performance coupled with solid buyer trust provides immediate opportunities and hints at long-term growth.

BlockDAG makes participation a breeze with three ticket tiers suited to different budgets. The Bronze Ticket, at an accessible 125 USDT, could net you as much as $250,000 USDT. To boost your chances, consider the Silver Ticket at 250 USDT, balancing cost with potential returns.

BlockDAG’s journey in the crypto market has been noteworthy, with presale batch 26 amassing $173.5 million and selling over 17.5 billion BDAG coins—a stunning 2240% growth since its inception. Ethereum’s Price Ascent: Analysts Eye $12,000 Target Ethereum is on the cusp of a significant rise, with predictions aiming for $12,000 in the coming market cycle. This optimism is fueled by Ethereum’s continued tech advancements, especially sharding, which aims to boost network efficiency and speed by splitting the blockchain into smaller segments. Additionally, Layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism are reducing network congestion and lowering costs, enhancing Ethereum’s allure. As Ethereum solidifies its lead with growing DeFi and NFT adoption, it must navigate challenges like emerging competitors and potential regulatory changes. XRP’s Price Forecast for 2025: Valuing 1,000 Tokens Anticipation for XRP’s 2025 price is high, spurred by Ripple’s growing adoption and impressive market performance last year. With its price around $3, XRP’s value has nearly quintupled in 2024. Analysts are optimistic, predicting a rise to $5–$7 by mid-2025, potentially boosting the value of 1,000 XRP tokens to $5,000–$7,000. However, the volatile nature of the crypto market calls for cautious optimism. Factors like global regulatory changes and Ripple’s strategies will heavily influence XRP’s trajectory, though its role in cross-border payments and possible integration with central bank digital currencies strengthen its long-term viability. Final Thoughts As 2025 dawns, the crypto sector brims with both potential profits and exciting prospects. BlockDAG’s $1M USDT New Year’s Raffle offers both immediate gratification and the potential for crypto growth, making it one of the best crypto projects for all participants. With Ethereum’s technological strides and XRP’s promising price outlook, the diverse paths of cryptocurrencies are poised to influence the future financial landscape.

Prince Elon (ELONPRIN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONPRIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Prince Elon can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Prince Elon could become the next viral memecoin. Prince Elon launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Prince Elon on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Prince Elon by entering its contract address – 7rAsmWGTtPFY9RFnhd9biard7PrWtw5ZigowwfmaXUQ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONPRIN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/new-solana-memecoin-prince-elon-elonprin-will-surge-13000-ahead-of-exchange-listing-as-shib-doge-and-bonk-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
38285978,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323250,1735515000,Japanese Regulator Wants to Change Its Classification of Crypto,"The classification of crypto could change in Japan after the nation’s top financial regulator announced plans to start viewing tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) as “financial assets.” Per the Japanese news outlet CoinPost and an official Financial Services Agency (FSA) document , the regulator unveiled its position in its requests for tax reform in the fiscal year 2025. Classification of Crypto Set to Change in Japan? The FSA wrote that it wants to start considering cryptoassets as “financial assets” that “the general public can invest in.” Trading volumes on Japan’s bitFlyer crypto exchange over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) Currently, Japanese law classifies cryptoassets as “payment instruments” under the terms of the Payment Services Act. The switch to a more “investment”-focused definition would represent something of a legitimization for crypto. But such a change would seemingly be dependant on the stability of the crypto industry. And while the document stops short of calling for crypto tax reform, CoinPost wrote that it suggests “a possibility” that Japan’s controversial crypto tax rules “will be reviewed.” Costly climate disasters created a crisis for Japan's insurance industry. Firms resorted to collusion to cope. Read The Big Take https://t.co/tofX548z0v — Bloomberg Green (@climate) December 29, 2024 Ruling Party on Same Page? The move comes days after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) made similar claims in its own tax policy recommendations for FY2025. The LDP wants the crypto industry to incorporate “regulations on accountability and investor protection” that are “equivalent to those in place for stock investment in listed companies.” This would allow the law to start viewing “certain cryptoassets” as “financial products” commonly used in “the general public’s portfolios.” CoinPost wrote that the tone of the FSA’s document suggests that it is “endorsing [the LDP’s]” stance. The FSA, media outlets this year claimed, is readying a “fundamental review” of the way it regulates crypto. However, the FSA’s move appears to suggest it thinks the Payment Services Act offers insufficient protection to crypto investors. Inflation in Japan's capital accelerates, keeps rate hike prospects intact https://t.co/kPji7EHgz9 pic.twitter.com/cbDtZk2VdW — Reuters (@Reuters) December 27, 2024 Differing Views on Tax Reform There is another wrinkle for Japanese crypto traders. While the LDP appears keen to scrap Japan’s current crypto tax system, the FSA seems to have different ideas. Under the current system, crypto traders must declare their profits as “other income” on yearly tax declarations. That means high earners can pay up to 55% tax on their earnings. The LDP favors abolishing this system in favor of a capital gains tax on crypto earnings. The FSA, however, seems instead keen to place crypto “within a more comprehensive framework of income tax integration,” CoinPost explained. There does, though, appear to be a consensus about the need to change the legal classification of crypto in Japan. This is particularly relevant as Japanese companies like Metaplanet and Remixpoint begin to ramp up their Bitcoin-buying strategies.

CoinMarketCap data reveals that the total market cap for memecoins was $120.14 billion on Dec. 1. It peaked at $137.06 billion on Dec. 9 before plunging to a low of $92.67 billion on Dec. 23, marking a 32.38% decline within the month. As of now, memecoins’ market capitalization stands at $98.72 billion, down 18% from its value at the start of December. Pepe and Exchange Listings Propel Early December Surge Pepe (PEPE), the third-largest memecoin by market capitalization, mirrored the broader market’s fluctuations. According to Cointelegraph Markets Pro, Pepe’s price climbed to $0.000026 on Dec. 9 before dropping to $0.000017 by Dec. 20. On Dec. 4, Binance.US listed Pepe, driving the token to an all-time high and surpassing Uniswap’s token (UNI) in market capitalization by Dec. 7.

38283167,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=667993,1735513232,XRP Price Prediction: Fibonacci And Elliott Wave Analysis Suggests $15 By May 2025,"Egrag Crypto, a well-known crypto analyst on the social media platform X, recently shared an optimistic price prediction for XRP. According to the analyst, technical analysis of the XRP price on the weekly timeframe suggests that XRP is on track to reach a price target of $15 by May 5, 2025. Related Reading: CME Gap Threatens Bitcoin With Potential Drop To $77,000 – Analyst The analysis, which is rooted in Fibonacci levels and Elliott Wave theory, offers a long-term bullish outlook for the altcoin despite its recent decline over the past week. This is because the XRP price has been on a decline since the past seven days alongside the rest of the crypto market. Fibonacci And Elliott Wave Analysis For XRP According to Egrag Crypto, the Fibonacci 1.618 level indicates that May 5, 2025, could be a pivotal date for XRP’s price trajectory in the long term. His technical analysis uses auto-Fib time zones and trend-based Fibonacci on the weekly XRP timeframe price chart. Interestingly, this timeline aligns closely with the general sentiment surrounding XRP, as many crypto participants are currently looking forward to a surge in the first half of 2025. As such, the analyst also noted that it remains uncertain whether the predicted surge to $15 will occur before or after this predicted date. Speaking of price timeline, the $15 target is based on actual calculations and the Elliot Wave theory. According to the analyst, XRP is currently in Wave 4, which is the second corrective phase in the Elliot Wave theory. Once this phase is completed, Wave 5 is expected to be the next major move. Wave 5 is traditionally known for being the third impulse wave that pushes the asset’s price to new highs. To estimate the magnitude of Wave 5, the analyst examined the performance of the previous impulse waves 1 and 3. Notably, Waves 1 and 3 were highlighted by price increases of 63.39% and 570%, respectively. Using these figures, Egrag Crypto applied a common Elliott Wave principle that suggests Wave 5 often equals 61.8% of the combined gains of Waves 1 and 3. By applying this school of thought and punching in the numbers, Wave 5 is expected to result in an approximate price increase of around 391% for XRP. In terms of a price target, this translates to a price range around $15. Is A Long-Term Bullish Trajectory Still Valid For XRP? Despite XRP’s current decline over the past seven days, mirroring a broader market downturn, this technical analysis provides a counterpoint to the short-term bearish outlook. Particularly, XRP has been on a decline since it peaked at $2.82 on December 3. Related Reading: XRP Forms Bullish Flag Pattern: What’s Next For The Altcoin?

38283155,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=115759,1735513200,Ripple Rival Stellar Flashes Buy Signal as this Hidden Altcoin Trends Upwards,"As 2025 approaches, a notable change in the crypto environment sees Ripple (XRP) and Stellar (XLM), two key altcoins in the digital asset arena, ready for major developments that might reshape the market’s trajectory. In the midst of this evolving storyline, a disruptive entity, RCO Finance (RCOF), rises as a strong competitor, presenting a new take on decentralized finance (DeFi) through a combination of inventive features and progressive technology. Stellar Vs Ripple: Rivalry Intensifies As XLM Gears Up For Price Rally Recent examination by cryptocurrency specialist Ali Martinez reveals a positive signal for Stellar, suggesting a possible price turnaround after a significant correction driven by Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). The analyst recently pointed out that the Tom Demark (TD) sequential indicator has indicated a buy on XLM’s daily chart, implying that if the $0.33 support level remains intact, a price recovery could be forthcoming. At present, Stellar is priced at $0.37, slightly above this important level. Even with significant losses across different periods—4% in 24 hours, 8% in a week, and 23% in 14 days—Stellar continues to hold nearly 200% gains year-to-date. Conversely, Ripple’s XRP has shown greater strength, experiencing smaller declines of 2% and 4% during comparable times, while achieving an impressive monthly increase of roughly 60% that has brought one of the biggest altcoins in the market nearer to its all-time peaks. Although Stellar has lagged behind Ripple in recent months, the buy signal from the TD sequential indicator may create an opportunity for a comeback, enabling Stellar to narrow the gap with its rival. Moreover, market specialist CW has observed a bullish flag formation for Ripple’s competitor Stellar, predicting a possible target price of $0.82 after a breakout—close to its historical high of $0.87 achieved almost seven years prior. With the increasing positivity regarding Stellar and Ripple, RCO Finance is grabbing attention. Currently in its presale stage, RCO Finance has already secured close to $10 million, garnering interest for its unique strategy in DeFi. Now in the fourth phase of its presale, RCOF is set for considerable expansion, with estimates indicating a rise of almost 200%, anticipating the RCOF price to hit $0.214. So, what distinguishes RCO Finance from well-known entities such as Ripple and Stellar? AI Magic Unleashed To begin with, RCO Finance utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to offer an extensive range of financial products, making both traditional and decentralized finance accessible to all. The platform provides services like staking, yield farming, lending, and token swapping, all within a safe environment. A distinctive aspect of RCO Finance is its Robo Advisor powered by AI. This instrument functions as an automated investment manager, evaluating vast market information to provide customized investment strategies suited to each user’s financial objectives and risk preferences. Additionally, RCO Finance provides support for more than 120,000 digital assets spanning 12,500 asset classes, such as stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and derivatives. This wide access enables regular investors to diversify their portfolios, representing a major change from conventional models that frequently leave retail investors out of high-liquidity assets. RCO Finance’s Bullish Surge Post-Exchange Debut – Get Ready! RCO Finance also prioritizes user privacy by functioning on a Know-Your-Customer (KYC)-free platform, allowing for anonymous transactions. The governance framework promotes community involvement, enabling token holders to impact significant platform modifications and nurturing a feeling of ownership. As RCO Finance gets ready to debut on major exchanges, experts anticipate a spike in its price, possibly hitting between $0.40 and $0.50 soon after its launch. This offers a rare chance for initial investors to take advantage of the present positive market sentiment. Conclusion In summary, although Stellar and Ripple seek to strengthen their stance in the challenging blockchain payment landscape, RCO Finance is poised to challenge the existing norms with its groundbreaking solutions. With the market undergoing its bullish cycle led by Ripple and XRP’s performance, RCO Finance offers fascinating prospects for investors looking for expansion in the ever-changing realm of cryptocurrency.

38282744,https://crypto.news/?p=14323102,1735512247,Crypto VC funding set to surge: PitchBook predicts $18b in venture capital for 2025,"PitchBook analyst Robert Le expects crypto VC funding to be “much much stronger” in 2025 compared to 2024. “We’re going to see $18 billion or more in venture capital dollars that’s going to be invested into crypto,” Le told CNBC’s Jordan Smith. That’s a 50% increase from 2024, but still less than the roughly $30 billion “that was invested in 2021 and 2022,” he added. 2023 and 2024 recap Le described 2023 as a challenging year for crypto funding due to the collapse of FTX, erosion of trust, and higher interest rates. However, 2024 started strong with positive momentum driven by spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, or ETFs getting approved. Despite a slowdown mid-year, “we’re probably going to end [2024] at somewhere between $11 [billion] and $12 billion of invested capital, which is still 10 to 20% more than 2023,” he said. You might also like: Polymarket odds of Trump approving strategic Bitcoin reserves fall to 27% 2025 Funding Expectations Le’s projection of $18 billion or more in crypto VC funding is a 50% increase compared to 2024. Several factors bode well for the sector, he says. They include: Generalist investors are regaining interest, signaling potential large-scale investments. Crypto-native funds have significant dry powder but require generalist participation for substantial growth. Financial institutions will play a pivotal role by leveraging their trusted relationships with regulators. Shifting focus Le anticipates a shift in focus toward application-layer investments, moving beyond infrastructure projects. Examples include: Decentralized applications (dApps) targeting non-crypto users with better risk management. Use cases leveraging crypto infrastructure for non-crypto sectors such as mobility and energy data. The analogy of AWS serving as a base for companies like Uber and Airbnb highlights the need for robust applications atop crypto infrastructure to realize its full potential, Le argues. The benefit of ‘nothing’ Le emphasized the importance of regulatory clarity for the crypto industry’s growth. He expressed cautious optimism about the U.S. regulatory environment in 2025, noting: A shift in SEC leadership under the incoming Trump administration could result in fewer enforcement actions. Legislative progress, such as stablecoin bills or crypto-specific rules, would be beneficial but is not guaranteed. Even a lack of new regulatory actions could be an improvement over the past two years of uncertainty. Le concluded that a stable regulatory environment, coupled with growing institutional involvement and application-focused investments, could set the stage for significant advancements in the crypto sector in 2025. But even if the next presidential administration and incoming lawmakers “do nothing,” Le says, “that is already an improvement.” For the full interview, see below.

38282699,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634590,1735511882,Will corporate ownership of Bitcoin lead to its centralization and loss of freedom?,"As large corporations accumulate more Bitcoin, there is a risk of centralization, market manipulation, and increased government regulation that could undermine the original principles of decentralization and freedom in the future . In recent years, we have seen huge attention from large corporations towards Bitcoin, the celebrated currency for years as decentralized and peer-to-peer. It was the currency’s ability to function outside of central banks, governments, and large financial institutions that attracted people toward Bitcoin. Bitcoin was designed to be a decentralized digital currency owned and used by anyone anywhere in the world without the help of an intermediary. The increasing interest and participation of major corporations in the Bitcoin ecosystem raise concerns about its future in terms of decentralization and freedom. Rising corporate influence on Bitcoin Now, many giant corporations include Bitcoin on their balance sheets. According to CoinGecko companies like MicroStrategy hold over 444,262 Bitcoins, while Marathon Digital holds over 26,842. Marathon Digital is a Bitcoin mining company and owns 40,435 Bitcoins. Even Tesla holds 11,509 bitcoins. In addition, Galaxy Digital holding companies with over 15,449 Bitcoins, Coinbase holds over 9,183 Bitcoins, Bitcoin mining companies like CleanSpark hold around 6,154 Bitcoins, and Hut 8 also holds 9,102 Bitcoins and many more. This rising corporate involvement is an indicator of how Bitcoin is gaining importance in business strategies-whether as a store of value, hedge against inflation, or financial diversification tool. These companies can hold a big portion of the total supply since they acquire Bitcoin. For the simple fact that the total supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million, there’s the likelihood that a few companies own a large portion of Bitcoin that could significantly alter what the original intention of Bitcoin is-to be decentralized to everyone. Bitcoin becoming centralized This means that one of the most important concerns with this increase in corporate ownership is the potential centralization of Bitcoin. Companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Marathon Digital Holdings are buying ever more Bitcoin, and their reserves may eventually comprise a significant percentage of the overall supply. This may give these companies significant market power, which could lead to price manipulation and increased market volatility. If a few entities control large amounts of Bitcoin, they can buy or sell at will, which affects the price and causes fluctuations. Instead of Bitcoin as an open source currency that is free to be traded by any user and is almost a new tool for market control, it could be the means of giving power to a small group of corporate interests. Some corporations not only hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset but also engage actively in the mining process. Domination on Bitcoin mining It requires large quantities of cheap energy, the larger corporations can thus be able to invest heftily in mining, meaning they have the capacity of controlling a large proportion of the network’s mining power. This may have a result of centralization, which was initially what decentralization and accessibility aimed to achieve. The issue of mining centralization has been a long-term worry within the Bitcoin community. Early on, Bitcoin mining was an activity that someone with the right hardware could undertake. This, however, changed quite quickly as mining became challenging and its rewards attractive to professionalize the activity in question. Today, most mining is dominated by big companies that have the requisite resources to invest in more powerful, specialized equipment or secure cheap energy. Consequently, this centralization of power in mining leads to decisions that go into place on the Bitcoin network, as changes to protocol and even the general direction of future development. Staking may centralize Bitcoin control There are even more firms starting to participate in Bitcoin staking, even though Bitcoin does not use a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm. Some newer platforms support staking of users’ Bitcoin and reward the stakes held by users. If such services become more widespread and dominated by a few large corporate players, then centralization of control over the Bitcoin network will continue. This would allow these companies to decide how Bitcoin is used and to make money from the network, thereby having more control over the entire system. As more companies get involved, it becomes a serious concern for the future freedom of Bitcoin. Threat of Increased Regulatory Control This also increases the possibility of having greater regulatory pressure. Such enormous sums of Bitcoin held by corporations would mean an easy opportunity for governments to bring in strict regulations upon this asset. Such regulations could undermine the decentralized character of Bitcoin by forcing corporate holders to comply with state mandates in the form of KYC and AML requirements . This would make a scenario where Bitcoin is not an asset free from the governmental oversight but one with regulation, which may defeat the very core values for decentralization and freedom. The future of Bitcoin is becoming increasingly intertwined with the interests of large corporations. As the Bitcoin network keeps changing, so too will the community, regulators, and corporations realize that rising concentration of Bitcoin ownership means a lot to it. The potential for centralization, whether through corporate ownership or mining, could shift Bitcoin away from its original mission. If the power over Bitcoin remains in just a few people’s pockets, the dream of financial freedom might go down in flames. Therefore, continued decentralization must be addressed to maintain what Bitcoin was originally brought forth to become a resource for personal freedom and free access rather than corporative manipulation.

What started as a meme in the crypto world has transformed into a multi-billion dollar phenomenon, drawing in investors from all walks of life. But let’s be real, some meme coins seem to be fading out, and others are absolutely blowing up. One of those “blowing up” coins right now is BTFD Coin . While SPX6900 may have had its moment, it’s clear that the ongoing viral meme coin presale of BTFD is making waves like no other. Now, why is BTFD Coin grabbing so much attention? Well, it’s not just your average meme coin. BTFD is bringing something new to the table, like its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, referral program, staking rewards, and a mind-blowing 90% APY on staking. All of these features are creating a perfect storm of hype and potential returns. As SPX6900 seems to have run out of steam, BTFD is clearly picking up the pace, and investors are already seeing gains. In this article, we’re going to take a deeper look at BTFD Coin and SPX6900, examining why the former is taking the meme coin world by storm and why the latter is starting to look like old news. BTFD Coin: Taking Meme Coins to the Next Level BTFD Coin is the meme coin everyone’s talking about, and if you haven’t been paying attention, now’s the time to start. The ongoing viral meme coin presale has already raised over $4.6 million and sold more than 60 billion coins to over 7000 holders. And guess what? The presale isn’t even close to being over yet. In fact, we’re only in Stage 13, and the price has already skyrocketed from $0.000004 to $0.000142 per coin. That’s a staggering increase, but analysts are predicting it could hit $0.0006 by the end of the presale. So, yeah, the hype is real. So what makes BTFD Coin so unique compared to other meme coins like SPX6900? It’s the complete ecosystem BTFD is building. First off, BTFD has a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that went live in Stage 10 of the presale. Sure, the beta version of the game doesn’t offer rewards yet, but it’s already a glimpse of what’s coming. When the game is fully live, players will be able to earn rewards while having fun. It’s an innovative approach that’s bringing more utility to the meme coin space. But it doesn’t stop there. BTFD Coin also offers a 90% APY on staking, which is a total game-changer. Staking went live on December 2, and now investors can put their BTFD coins to work and earn passive income. With staking offering a 90% APY, that means your BTFD holdings can grow significantly while you just sit back and watch it happen. No wonder the presale is so popular! Another attractive feature is the BTFD Coin referral program. This allows early investors to earn rewards for bringing new people into the community. It’s a win-win situation that’s helping to spread the word and bring even more attention to the project. And of course, there’s the Bulls Squad —a community of dedicated supporters who are given exclusive updates, rewards, and special access. This gives investors a sense of belonging and makes them feel like they’re part of something bigger. SPX6900: Is It Already Yesterday’s News? SPX6900 had its time in the spotlight, no doubt about it. But lately, it seems like the presale has lost steam. While meme coins like BTFD Coin are racing ahead with innovative features and an engaged community, SPX6900’s presale numbers just aren’t showing the same level of excitement. Sure, it still has some loyal followers, but it’s not drawing the kind of attention that BTFD is. Why is that? Well, the biggest issue here is that SPX6900 doesn’t seem to offer much in terms of long-term value or utility. While meme coins were originally created as jokes, BTFD Coin has taken things to the next level by building an ecosystem that goes beyond just being a meme. With features like the Play-to-Earn game, staking rewards, and referral programs, BTFD is creating a much more compelling reason for people to invest. SPX6900, on the other hand, doesn’t seem to have the same kind of strategy for future growth. And without that, it’s starting to look like an old news story. When you compare the presale performance, it’s clear that SPX6900 is lagging behind. Investors are looking for projects with potential, and BTFD Coin is delivering on that front, while SPX6900 is left scrambling to keep up. In a world where investors are always searching for the next big thing, BTFD Coin has proven that it’s more than just hype—it’s a legitimate opportunity to make serious gains. While SPX6900 might have had its chance, it’s safe to say that its moment has passed. The Ongoing Viral Meme Coin Presale: Why BTFD Is the One to Watch So why is BTFD Coin’s ongoing viral meme coin presale such a big deal? It’s simple: the potential for massive gains. As mentioned, the presale price has already risen from $0.000004 to $0.000142 per coin, and analysts are predicting it could hit $0.0006 before the presale ends. With four stages still remaining, that’s a huge opportunity for anyone who’s looking to invest. Let’s break this down with an investment example. By investing $25,000 in BTFD coins during Stage 13 at the current price of $0.000142 per coin, you would receive approximately 176,056,338 coins. However, by applying the BIG50 bonus code, you’ll receive 50% more coins, bringing your total to 264,084,507 coins. When the presale concludes and the price increases to $0.0006 per coin, your investment without the BIG50 code would be worth around $105,633.80. With the BIG50 bonus, your investment would grow to a value of approximately $158,450.70, offering an additional $52,816.90 in potential earnings. This presents a great opportunity to enhance your investment as the presale progresses. But the real beauty of the BTFD Coin presale lies in its potential beyond the presale. With its Play-to-Earn game, 90% APY on staking , and referral program, the value of BTFD Coin is only going to increase as the project continues to grow. Analysts are predicting a bright future for BTFD, and early investors are already seeing the benefits. Now is the time to get in on this ongoing viral meme coin presale before it’s too late. BTFD Coin is moving fast, and with analysts predicting a surge in price, you’ll want to be on the winning side of this one. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out on the BTFD Coin Presale BTFD Coin is a meme coin with real potential, and the ongoing viral meme coin presale is the perfect opportunity to get in early. With features like a Play-to-Earn game, staking rewards, and an engaging referral program, BTFD Coin is setting itself up for long-term success. Meanwhile, SPX6900 seems to be fading into the background, with its presale losing steam and investors looking elsewhere for the next big thing. If you want to be part of the next big wave in the meme coin space, now’s the time to act. With over $4.6 million raised in the presale and the price already on the rise, there’s no better time to jump in. Don’t let this opportunity slip away—join the BTFD Coin presale today and make the most of this wealth-generation opportunity before it’s too late!

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE.

38281751,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376155,1735510203,Crypto Scammers Bait Thieves with Public Seed Phrases in New Scheme: Kaspersky,"A new crypto scam appears to be flipping the script on thieves. By publicly sharing seed phrases, scammers set up bait wallets that entangle opportunists in a deceptive scheme designed to exploit their attempts to steal funds. According to cybersecurity firm Kaspersky’s latest findings, scammers post crypto wallet seed phrases on YouTube comments using newly created accounts. Initial Bait The scheme begins with a comment under a finance-related video from someone claiming to need help transferring USDT, a stablecoin, to another wallet. They reveal their full seed phrase, essentially sharing the key to their wallet, which seems suspicious at first glance. This act of sharing a seed phrase is a red flag, as it is the gateway to accessing and controlling the funds in a wallet. Kaspersky revealed that the comment looks something like this: “I have a question. I have USDT stored in my wallet, and I have the seed phrase. How to transfer my funds to another wallet?” Upon further investigation, Kaspersky said that similar comments were posted from newly created accounts, each containing identical recovery phrases and requests for assistance. The scam assumes that an unscrupulous person, rather than offering help, might take advantage of the situation. With access to the seed phrase, they can open the wallet, which might contain a significant sum of cryptocurrency – in this case, the equivalent of $8,000 in USDT. However, the scammers have set a trap. The wallet is actually a multi-signature one, requiring multiple approvals to authorize transactions. When a thief attempts to transfer USDT, they discover that the wallet lacks enough TRX to cover the transaction fee. When the thief tries to send TRX from their own wallet, the tokens are rerouted to a completely different wallet. This clever setup ensures that even the most opportunistic thief cannot easily steal the funds. Trap For The Greedy Kaspersky’s investigation reveals that the scam primarily targets other criminals, tricking them into becoming the victims. By impersonating inexperienced crypto users, the scammers deceive thieves into attempting to steal funds that they ultimately cannot access. “So, the scammers are impersonating beginners who foolishly share access to their cryptowallets, tricking equally naive thieves – who end up becoming the victims. In this scenario, the scammers are something like digital Robin Hoods, as the scheme primarily targets other crooked individuals.” The post Crypto Scammers Bait Thieves with Public Seed Phrases in New Scheme: Kaspersky appeared first on CryptoPotato .",NEGATIVE,TRX | USDT,TRX | USDT,,0,0,Crypto Potato,https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-scammers-bait-thieves-with-public-seed-phrases-in-new-scheme-kaspersky/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/38281751.jpeg

Cardano’s $1 Dream Crushed? 4.3 Billion ADA Wall Blocks the Way Cardano is struggling to reach the $1 mark due to a large sell wall of 4.3 billion ADA, purchased at an average price of $1.03, according to IntoTheBlock data. Approximately 309,450 addresses holding ADA in the $0.947 to $1.09 range are currently at a loss, which could impede any potential price increases. Currently, Cardano (ADA) is trading around $0.92, down 9.4% over the past week amid ongoing selling pressure in the crypto market. If the price drops further, support is anticipated between $0.659 and $0.834, as 238,860 addresses that bought within this range are likely to step in and buy again. XLM Plunges 16%: Can It Recover? Key Support Level at Risk Stellar (XLM) is currently trading at $0.38, reflecting a 7.9% drop in the past week. However, recent analysis indicates that it might be set for a price increase, according to market analysts. They spotted a potential buy signal on XLM’s daily chart. Nevertheless, there’s a key factor to watch. XLM needs to maintain the $0.33 support to attract more buyers and stabilize the market. A drop below this level could indicate a downward trend, complicating recovery. This uncertainty has led many XLM investors to explore other investment opportunities.

The European regulators have not expressly stated if USDT meets the new compliance guidelines. MiCA Uncertainty Surrounds USDT However, Coinbase, the U.S. leading crypto exchange, delisted USDT from its European services earlier this month in an anticipatory move. Coinbase cited the MiCA regulatory compliance guidelines as the reason for the delisting. Other major exchanges, such as Binance and Crypto.com, have continued to offer USDT to its users in Europe. This has generated speculation about the true status of one of the world’s dominant stablecoins. With no clear policy statement from the regulators on MiCA and USDT, market participants have been left guessing. The statement from a MiCA Crypto Alliance’s Technical Committee member did little to provide any clear stance. Juan Ignacio Ibañez, while commenting on the situation, maintained that no regulator has proclaimed USDT non-compliant. Ibañez, however, stated that the absence of a clear proclamation does not imply that USDT is compliant. Tether’s Strategic Moves Amid Uncertainty Analysts have warned that Tether’s refusal to comply with the MiCA regulations might affect Europe’s market . Notably, users in the region could experience major disruptions and weaken Europe’s status as a hub for crypto innovation. Additionally, an official ban on USDT might result in soaring costs for traders and impact market liquidity. Interestingly, a financial analyst, Jacob King, observed that Tether had not minted new coins in over two weeks. King believes the impact of this and an official ban could cause significant disruptions. Amid the uncertainty, Tether has invested in European stablecoin company StablR. StablR, licensed in Malta, issues Euro and U.S. dollar stablecoins. The move by Tether suggests a strategic development to maintain a foothold in the EU market. What Lies Ahead for Tether? Meanwhile, Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s CEO, has justified the company’s operational practices, noting that they have not violated any known guidelines. Ardoino emphasized the company remains focused on network collaborations and USDT’s practical uses in the market. The next few hours might unfold new developments and clarify MiCA and the USDT episode.

38280744,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99507,1735507934,Cardano Price Slumps 5% Amid $1.6 Billion Wider Crypto Outflows,"Cardano (ADA) price has plunged 5% in the last 24 hours following a downward trend in sentiments and on-chain factors. This follows a wider market correction that saw over $1.6 billion wiped out of the ecosystem. Sharp declines have lowered trader momentum against previous bullish projections after Bitcoin (BTC) moved past $90K. Cardano slipped the highest among the top 10 crypto assets by market cap over the past 48 hours. The community dubbed ETH killer trades at $0.86, falling 4.7%, with its market cap slightly above $30.4 billion. ADA has decreased 18% in the last seven days, extending losses after previous gains. Despite reduced retail and institutional upward movements, the asset has held on to monthly gains picked up after the United States Presidential elections. Crypto users share conflicting opinions about the wider market’s recovery pace going into the new year. Cardano Foundation’s X Account Hack Spiked Fears Cardano’s downtrend heightened after the hack of the foundation’s X (formerly Twitter) account. The account was compromised on Dec 8 with the bad actors promoting a fake token as well as other false claims. A major point was the fake ADAsol token, which claimed to have ceased support for ADA. The scam token generated $500,000 before it slumped 99%. Malicious actors also claimed to have been slammed by a lawsuit by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Users were advised not to interact with links from the page following the incident. “ The Cardano Foundation regrets to inform our community that we have been served with a lawsuit by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on December 8, 2024. In light of this unexpected legal action, we have made the difficult decision to immediately cease all support toward the ADA token to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements,” the hackers wrote. A Slow Ecosystem The last 48 hours shown multiple crypto assets losing gains recorded in previous weeks. A glance at decentralized finance (DeFi) numbers also shows a similar downward trajectory. The total value locked (TVL) on Cardano plunged 21% from an all-time high of $708 million. As platforms lost numbers, overall transactions plunged, leading to the status quo. The crypto ecosystem has seen about $1.6 billion in liquidations since the last dip. Daily trading volumes are also in the red zone, although slight institutional numbers were recorded. Cardano funds recorded $5.2 million in institutional flows last week.",NEGATIVE,ADA | BTC,ADA | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/cardano-price-slumps-5-amid-1-6-billion-wider-crypto-outflows/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png
38280663,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=667956,1735507852,Chainlink Whales Accumulate $77 Million LINK Amid Price Correction – Details,"Amid a general market retracement, prominent altcoin Chainlink has recorded a 29.89% price decline from its local market top at $30.31. LINK currently hovers around $21 having failed to move past $26 despite recent uptrends. During this price fall, LINK whales have adopted an accumulation approach signaling confidence in the altcoin’s long-term profitability. Related Reading: Chainlink Price Could Crash 30% To $15 — Here’s How Chainlink Whales Acquire 3.58 Million LINK In 3 Days Following a strong bullish performance in early December, the crypto market has undergone a significant correction in the past two weeks attributed to several factors including a flash crash price and potential reductions of Fed rate cuts in 2025. As this corrective market persists, blockchain analytics company Santiment has reported an accumulation spree by LINK whales holding between 1 million-10 million LINK. In an X post on December 28, Santiment states that these large LINK holders have purchased 3.58 million LINK valued at $76.9 million over the past three days. Generally, significant levels of whale accumulation are indicated as bullish signals as these large token holders are confident of future gains. In the case of a price decline such as this, these massive accumulation levels reflect the belief that LINK is currently undervalued with a potential market rebound on the horizon. Related Reading: Chainlink And AAVE Surge After Trump’s Crypto Project Invests In Both Key Resistance Levels For LINK While high levels of whale accumulation are one sign of an impending price rally, analysis platform More Crypto Online has shared another positive insight on the LINK market. According to a recent X post, these market analysts state Chainlink still maintains an uptrend on larger time frames despite’s recent correction with its major support level set at $17.65. Based on the Elliott Wave Theory, If the LINK’s price holds above this level, the altcoin is predicted to rise to $69 in line with the expected third wave of the current market cycle. However, for confirmation of a price uptrend, Chainlink must break through resistance levels at $25.10 and $28.30. A decisive five-wave move above these levels would solidify the bullish case and suggest further price appreciation. In Elliott Wave theory, the five-wave structure is a reliable pattern indicating a strong trend continuation, making the breakthrough of these resistance levels pivotal for the ongoing rally. At the time of writing, Chainlink trades at $21.90 reflecting a 1.44% gain in the past 24 hours. However, the asset’s daily trading volume is down by 12.55% and valued at $726.44 million. With a market cap of $13.96 billion, LINK is ranked as the 13th largest cryptocurrency.

38280657,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634567,1735507259,EU’s stablecoin rules hint at political a power play with Tether against America,"The European Union could be playing a dangerous game with Tether, the world’s largest stablecoin, and it looks less like financial regulation and more like a calculated political jab. Under the new Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) rules , set to take full effect tomorrow, the EU has made it crystal clear that Tether’s $102 billion worth of U.S. Treasuries aren’t good enough for their taste. Instead, they’re demanding that stablecoin issuers back their tokens with at least 60% reserves held in fiat within EU-regulated banks. If that isn’t a loud and flashy rejection of American financial dominance, what is? MiCA rules: Control disguised as compliance MiCA’s framework claims to be about safety, security, and trust. Stablecoin issuers need to jump through hoops like obtaining licenses, ensuring reserves match tokens, and complying with consumer protection measures. All fair enough, right? Except this isn’t about fair play—it’s about control. Let’s be real. By ignoring Tether’s U.S. Treasuries as valid collateral, the EU is effectively saying it doesn’t trust the backbone of the American financial system. Those Treasuries represent some of the most stable assets in the world. But no, the EU wants euros, and it wants them in its banks. It’s not hard to see the politics at play here. Tether hasn’t been officially labeled non-compliant—yet. But with no clear guidance, exchanges like Coinbase are already delisting USDT in anticipation. Binance and Crypto.com are holding out for now, but we all know now that the clock is ticking. If Tether can’t meet these requirements fast, its removal from European platforms could be devastating for crypto liquidity. The EU’s quiet rebellion By demanding a 60% reserve in EU fiat held within its borders, the bloc is effectively rejecting U.S. debt as a trustworthy backing. This is about moving the balance of power. The EU has been desperate to carve out a bigger slice of the global financial system for years, and stablecoins are their latest target. The implications are massive. If Tether decides the cost of compliance is too high and exits the EU market, other stablecoin issuers will likely face the same choice. USDC, for instance, might have gotten ahead of the curve by securing compliance, but it’s no secret that similar regulations could follow elsewhere. Without USDT, liquidity fragmentation becomes a real problem. Markets will slow down, fees will rise, and efficiency will take a hit. The irony? The EU’s power play would backfire spectacularly. By pushing USDT out, they’re also risking their own relevance in the global crypto market. The U.S., under the crypto-friendly Trump administration, is about to become a haven for innovation, pulling talent and capital away from Europe. If that happens, the EU might have won the battle but it’d have lost the war.",NEGATIVE,USDT | USDC,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | USDT | USDC,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/eus-stablecoin-rules-hint-at-political-a-power-play-with-tether-against-america/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38280657.jpeg

Total funds from whales have topped a six-month high, spiking sell pressure this week. XRP price has plunged 3% today and 5% over the week, with traders flagging low sentiments. New CryptoQuant data shows over 2.6 billion XRP were deposited on Binance in the last 30 days. This change in dynamics continues as the asset records a sharp decline after soaring to levels not seen in months above a $140 billion market cap. The increased amount of XRP on centralized exchanges ignited major sell-offs, which became the highest whale value since April 2024. Cryptowhale movements to centralized exchanges tend to crash the prices of most assets due to the size of holdings. Exchange flows determine the strength and weakness of the bull cycle, showing trader sentiment. This becomes a bearish phase based on the ease of sale out of exchanges. “ This is the highest amount of XRP deposited by large holders since April 2024, showing a noticeable increase in activity among whales. The large inflows suggest that big XRP holders are actively transferring XRP over the network, and interact with Binance as an exchange. Whale deposits can often signal potential shifts in strategy, as these players have significant amounts of assets at their disposal.” What’s Next For XRP? XRP has lost a significant chunk of gains in the past few weeks after flipping Tether as the third-largest coin by market cap. This led to positive projections as bulls set sights on an all-time high. Recent headwinds have lowered traders’ expectations, although bulls set sights on gains amid institutional activities. Institutional traders are drawn to XRP because of its cross-border payment potential as global crypto adoption soars. Furthermore, Ripple has made significant strides to boost XRP and advance payments globally. This year, Ripple launched RLUSD, joining the stablecoin space with partnerships with multiple exchanges. The company also announced a collaboration to roll out the premier tokenized money fund on the XRP Ledger. Aside from global partnerships, XRP is expected to soar based on a surge in other top assets. Bitcoin’s latest drive above $100K and upward movement since the U.S. elections has sparked altcoins.

This is because ELONPRIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Prince Elon can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Prince Elon could become the next viral memecoin. Prince Elon launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Prince Elon on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Prince Elon by entering its contract address – 7rAsmWGTtPFY9RFnhd9biard7PrWtw5ZigowwfmaXUQ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONPRIN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/solana-memecoin-prince-elon-elonprin-will-surge-13000-before-exchange-listing-as-shib-doge-and-bonk-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Optimistic investors now face the reality that Dogecoin’s $1 race will take much longer than expected. Conversely, WallitIQ (WLTQ) , the presale altcoin currently shaking the market, is waxing stronger. Leading analysts now predict the altcoin will cross the $1 mark ahead of Dogecoin in the next three weeks. Dogecoin Price Declines, Pushes $1 Dream Further Away The Dogecoin price has headed south following the current market downtrend. A steady drop in on-chain activities and trading volumes reflects reduced investor interest and engagement, significantly weakening the Dogecoin price. Additionally, with less interest rate cuts than anticipated, a wave of selling-off surges across the crypto market. However, the FOMO created by the bull run following Trump’s election win has begun to die off, resulting in the Dogecoin price’s ongoing correction. Yet, amid this chaos, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) altcoin retains its promise of crossing the $1 mark in three weeks. Currently selling at $0.0243 , WallitIQ (WLTQ) will surge 4,015%, bringing in gains for investors attentive enough to discern its potential. With a 42% gain recorded across its previous presale stage and an imminent 71% surge, the market is confident that the WallitIQ (WLTQ) altcoin will see unprecedented growth. In addition, investors who buy WallitIQ (WLTQ) can now compete for a share of its 20% tokenomics allocated for rewarding early adopters. With their eyes on a 180% APY, investors who buy the altcoin continue to stake it in WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) liquidity pools. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Disrupts The Market With Impressive Presale Run, Set To Cross $1 In 3 Weeks WallitIQ (WLTQ) is set to outpace the Dogecoin price in the next three weeks as leading analysts compare the AI altcoin’s fundamentals to Dogecoin. Unlike Dogecoin, which depends on its community sentiment and celebrity endorsements, its revolutionary DeFi wallet, record-breaking presale, and unlimited potential underpin WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) success and massive projections. WallitIQ (WLTQ) has raised over $5 million in its ongoing presale, priced at a mere $0.0243 . The presale is seeing overwhelming support, especially as crypto powerhouses fail to deliver their promise of massive profits. Hence, even Dogecoin price watchers and investors are diversifying massively, buying WallitIQ (WLTQ) altcoins in huge tranches of $10,000 and more. WallitIQ (WLTQ), the homonymous DeFi wallet behind the altcoin, is a major factor in the altcoin’s success. Its artificial intelligence and machine learning integration are driving rapid adoption as traders and investors hope to gain the best experience using the DeFi wallet when it launches. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) Scan & Pay QR feature , which simplifies DeFi transactions, is one of its most discussed features. Users can simply scan a receiver’s QR code, and the transaction will be completed in seconds, limiting the possibility of sending funds to the wrong wallet address. WallitIQ (WLTQ) also offers a Fully DeFi mode, which allows users to trade their cryptocurrencies in a truly decentralized, peer-to-peer environment. Unarguably, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is the most promising altcoin in the market right now. This powerful altcoin is swiftly taking over the crypto wallet and AI market, enabling investors to trade more than 1,000 cryptocurrencies directly within their wallets. Its smart contract audit by SolidProof , a revered smart contract auditing firm, also strongly fuels the presale’s success. Investors who linger will struggle to keep pace with WallitIQ (WLTQ) as this presale altcoin delivers life-changing 4,015% gains to profit-takers. Conclusion The shifting dynamics of the crypto market underscore the volatility that investors must navigate as the Dogecoin price $1 milestone becomes increasingly elusive. However, the emerging WallitIQ (WLTQ) $0.0243 altcoin offers a compelling narrative of rapid growth. Seasoned and new investors are reconsidering their strategies, competing for the fortunes this altcoin will bring. So gear up; buy the WallitIQ (WLTQ) altcoin now at $0.0243 and position for generational wealth in 2025 and beyond.

38279816,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=314528,1735506026,"Trader Predicts ‘Aggressive’ Upside Rally for Bitcoin, Unveils ‘Realistic’ Bull Market Price Target for BTC","A crypto strategist known for making timely Bitcoin and altcoin calls is outlining a potential path for BTC to end the current bull market with a bang. Pseudonymous analyst Credible Crypto tells his 65,900 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin appears to be in the fifth and final leg of its secular bull market that began about six years ago. The trader practices the Elliott Wave theory, which states that a bullish asset tends to witness five-wave rallies with wave five acting as the final leg up prior to a correction. According to Credible, Bitcoin could witness a parabolic surge in the coming months to complete its fifth and final wave. “So we’re in the final leg of the final leg, in my opinion, of the cycle that started back here in 2018 at $3,000 Bitcoin. Within this final fifth wave, again the idea is that if this final fifth leg up has started, which at this point it seems like it has, it should be rather aggressive… The idea is that this fifth wave should generally be a blow-off top.” Source: Credible Crypto/YouTube The trader is also unveiling his bull market price targets for Bitcoin, predicting that BTC could realistically surge by nearly 60% from current levels before transitioning to a new trend. “We could see this move up very aggressively. And the longer that we take down here to move up, that means the higher we’re going to go. So again, I previously said above $100,000… $150,000 is realistic based on what we’ve seen so far. But we could push up to $200,000. We could even push up to $250,000 with my absolute max for this cycle being $300,000. I don’t think we’ll get close to $300,000 but we could see $200,000 to $220,000. It all just depends on how aggressively we move up and the amount of time we take to move up. The longer that we take to finish off this move, the higher we’re going to go.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $95,075.

38279715,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634574,1735505405,"Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve plan could drive Bitcoin to $150K-$400K in 2025, says Blockware","Bitcoin’s price could rise from $150,000 to $400,000 by 2025, with a potential 400% increase from its current price of $94,981, according to Blockware Solutions. This depends on factors like Donald Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve plan, Federal Reserve policies, and corporate adoption. If these align, Bitcoin could see a 58% rise to $150,000 or soar to $400,000 in the most optimistic scenario. Bitcoin’s price in 2025 might skyrocket, but Blockware says it could rise between $150,000 and $400,000, depending on important factors such as Donald Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve plan, the Federal Reserve’s policies, and corporate adoption. According to Blockware Solutions, a leading crypto mining firm, Bitcoin’s price may increase moderately or rise dramatically, depending on how these factors evolve. Blockware’s report outlines three possible scenarios for Bitcoin’s price in 2025. Blockware’s scenarios for Bitcoin The worst-case scenario suggests that Bitcoin could rise to $150,000, a 58% increase from its current price of $94,981. This would happen if Trump does not create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the Federal Reserve maintains high interest rates, making traditional investments more attractive. In a more positive scenario, Bitcoin could be at $225,000. The base case for this estimate assumes that the U.S. government will successfully create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates as expected, and corporate adoption of Bitcoin continues at the current rate. The most optimistic scenario, or bull case, puts the price of Bitcoin at $400,000. For this to occur, three key factors must fall into place. Key Factors; Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve, Fed Policies, and Corporate Adoption First, the Federal Reserve would have to implement a more accommodative monetary policy, making traditional assets less appealing and encouraging investment in riskier assets like Bitcoin. Second, adoption at the corporate level has to speed up, when the giants like Amazon, Apple, or Tesla announce their intention to carry Bitcoin on their balance sheet. The third step is that the U.S. government will need to hold Bitcoin within its reserve and buy additional quantities to increase its store. This will require some major policy shift, integrating Bitcoin into the U.S. traditional financial system. Corporate adoption is crucial for Bitcoin’s future price. Companies such as Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla could increase the price of Bitcoin if they decide to integrate it into their financial strategies. However, recent events, such as Microsoft shareholders rejecting a proposal to add Bitcoin to the company’s balance sheet, indicate that corporate adoption remains uncertain. Without major corporate investment, it will be tough for Bitcoin to hit those higher price points, like $400,000. Government policies, especially Trump’s proposed Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, are important for Bitcoin’s rally. A national Bitcoin reserve by the U.S. government may add legitimacy to Bitcoin and attract even more institutional investment. Nevertheless, some analysts believe that in 2025, the U.S. government will not be able to build up its reserves meaningfully in Bitcoin, and thus its growth may be constrained. The Federal Reserve’s interest rate policies will, therefore, greatly influence Bitcoin’s price. If the Fed continues raising interest rates or maintains the high-interest rates, this may push Bitcoin away from investors, who expect higher returns on their investment. On the other hand, if the Fed is lowering interest rates, the environment for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general becomes more propitious as investors seek assets with more growth. The price of Bitcoin will be influenced by long-term holders, which are people who have held their Bitcoin for more than 155 days. These holders will either sell large amounts of Bitcoin and flood the market, thereby pushing the price down, or continue holding their assets, which may stabilize the price and push it higher. As Bitcoin’s price in 2025 will greatly be a function of government policies, corporate adoption, and macroeconomic conditions that all play into each other. A bearish case would estimate to around $150,000; the base case has it at $225,000, and there’s always the bull case which would take it as high as $400,000.

Here’s why the price of the world’s largest and oldest crypto is headed above the oft-discussed $1,000,000 threshold. $1 Million BTC Could Be On The Horizon, According To Pippen While some pundits are warning of more pain in the crypto market as the United States Federal Reserve signaled fewer rate cuts for next year while clarifying that it prohibits state holdings of BTC and doesn’t seek a change in the law to do so, Scottie Pippen remains incredibly bullish about the price of Bitcoin. In a recent post on X, the former NBA star noted that investors are not late just because Bitcoin soared past the long-coveted $100K mark. According to him, the top crypto is primed to hit a staggering $1 million per coin. “I think I’m early to Bitcoin because it’s $1.7 Trillion Market Cap out of a total $900 Trillion in global assets. Next stop, $1 MILLION $BTC.” https://twitter.com/ScottiePippen/status/1873130534718849452 While Pippen might not seem like a key figure in the cryptosphere, his previous Bitcoin forecast was bizarrely precise. As ZyCrypto reported previously, the six-time NBA Champion claimed that the pseudonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto visited him in a dream and told him that BTC would surge above $84,000 on Nov. 5. BTC ended up reaching the $84K mark on Nov. 11, indicating that Pippen’s prognosis was just slightly off. At $1 million, Bitcoin would be a $24 trillion asset class, making it eight times bigger than Apple, the world’s largest company by market capitalization, and roughly 1.6 times bigger than gold’s market cap. Similar $1 Million BTC Price Targets $1 million per Bitcoin is obviously a lofty target. However, for years, this price has been forecasted by popular analysts across the traditional finance and crypto industry. ARK Invest Cathie Wood, for instance, maintains her prediction that the price of BTC will rocket to $1 million by 2030, noting that major investment banks such as Morgan Stanley, Merryl Lynch, and Bank of America will likely enter the Bitcoin space. Moreover, Bitwise Invest’s head of alpha strategies, Jeff Park, recently forecasted that the Bitcoin price could hit $1 million in 2025 if the U.S. establishes a strategic national Bitcoin reserve. “That’s the only math in which Bitcoin can hit $1mm+ in 2025 when it happens,” Park postulated.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/nba-legend-scottie-pippen-says-1-million-is-the-next-stop-for-btc-price/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

This year, the whale sold 49,000 Ethereum, worth $172 million, leaving only a small portion of its holdings. The liquidation has sparked speculation in the Ethereum market. Traders and investors are uncertain about how the continued sell-off will affect Ethereum’s price and market trends. What’s Happening with the Ethereum Whale? This whale’s sell-off, which has averaged around $3,528 per Ethereum, has been a major event. The bulk of the whale’s liquidation is nearly complete, with only 7,594 Ethereum remaining. Depending on market conditions, this is valued between $25 million and $72 million. This selling behavior is often associated with price drops as the increased supply creates downward pressure. Traders are becoming anxious about the possibility of a price crash. Ethereum Faces Market Pressure as Price Consolidates As Ethereum settles around $3,390, the whale’s liquidation has added to the strain on the price trajectory. This key level is just above strong support from the 200-day and 100-day exponential moving averages (EMAs). Traders are watching these thresholds closely to see if Ethereum would dip below certain thresholds, particularly at the $3,219 and $3,000 mark levels. If this happens, it could usher in a bearish trend. Simultaneously, Ethereum has struggled to break the psychological $4,000 resistance mark. The sell-offs have contributed to immediate price drops and underscored the broader challenge, including insufficient trading volume and lack of momentum. A Chance for Market Stability Yet, this story is not all bearish. The nearing conclusion of the whale’s liquidation could ease some downward pressure, opening the door for a more stable market. Ethereum could regain investor confidence as the selling pressure eases, especially if prices rise above the whale’s average selling price of $3,528. A successful retest of this level could trigger a bullish rebound, suggesting the worst may be over. However, if the price drops, traders may face more uncertainty, and Ethereum’s market could struggle to gain momentum. At this critical juncture, the market is watching closely to see whether Ethereum will break through its resistance levels or continue to consolidate. The end of the whale’s sell-off could be the thing that helps Ethereum take a new direction.

38278938,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=27353,1735504111,Bitcoin Price Dips Below $94K Amid Consolidation and Bearish Signals,"Bitcoin’s price dropped below the $94,000 mark on Dec. 29, down from its all-time high of approximately $108,000 reached on Dec. 17, 2024. Data from CoinMarketCap shows Bitcoin has declined 1.29% over the last 24 hours and 2.67% in the past week. BTC is trading below its 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) and approaching its 50-day EMA, consolidating between $92,000 and $99,000 after November and December’s historic bull rally. Despite this, Bitcoin remains above its 200-day EMA, a crucial support level, since October 2024. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 42, signaling that the asset is neither overbought nor oversold. Taker-Buy-Sell-Ratio Drops, USDT Dominance Rises The Bitcoin Taker-Buy-Sell-Ratio, a metric that reflects market sentiment, currently stands at 0.92. A value below 1 suggests bears dominate the market, while a value above 1 indicates bullish control. TradingView contributor “The ForexX Mindset” warned of a possible market dump that could push BTC’s price to around $81,500. The analyst pointed to rising USDT market dominance as a signal that investors are moving to safer assets. Technical analyst Aksel Kibar echoed this sentiment, predicting a correction to $80,000 based on a classic head-and-shoulders chart pattern. Perpetual Futures Funding Rates Remain Positive Despite bearish on-chain signals, BTC perpetual futures funding rates remain positive, indicating long traders maintain control and are willing to pay short traders to hold their positions. Long-Term Outlook Hinges on U.S. Policies The long-term trajectory of Bitcoin’s price depends on the Trump administration’s regulatory approach and the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy in 2025. Crypto mining firm Blockware has set a wide-ranging price forecast of $150,000–$400,000 for BTC in the new year, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding these factors.",NEGATIVE,BTC | USDT,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/bitcoin-price-dips-below-94k-amid-consolidation-and-bearish-signals/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Bitcoin’s dominance continues to decline after recently reaching its peak, and we are seeing an influx into smaller projects. Numerous large-cap altcoins have witnessed incredible gains in November as investors prepare for the altcoin season. The altcoin market has seen a resurgence as investors search for the next profit-making machine. While Bitcoin (BTC) trades around the $93,000 range, altcoins, such as Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE), saw massive gains. Join us as we explore the altcoin market and investigate the hottest projects expected to rocket in 2025. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE) is the largest memecoin by market cap and is the 7th largest crypto with a market cap exceeding $59.13 billion. Elon Musk, the world’s richest man with a net worth exceeding $350 billion, is the CEO of Tesla, owner of social media platform X (formerly Twitter), and one of the president-elect’s most prominent supporters and has long endorsed Dogecoin . Musk recently joined the Trump campaign and was integral to Trump’s victory, and his involvement with the republican party could see DOGE run to new highs in the coming months. DOGE’s surge stepped into overdrive after Donald Trump released a statement revealing that Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. According to Trump, DOGE will pave the way for his administration to “dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditure, and restructure Federal Agencies – Essential to the “Save America” Movement.” DOGE is expected to surge after DeFi Technologies introduced Valour Dogecoin (DOGE) ETP on Sweden’s Spotlight Stock Market. The ETP will allow retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to DOGE without directly owning the asset. Solana (SOL) Solana (SOL) is one of the hottest altcoins this year, with gains exceeding 81% in the past year. The Solana network is the go-to platform for memecoin developments thanks to its ability to handle high TPS at low transaction fees. The power of the Solana blockchain and the network’s robust and active community make it the ideal space for memecoin development. Solana (SOL) has become a formidable player in the crypto space, and now it is targeting a considerable part of Ethereum’s (ETH) market share. SOL reached a new ATH of $263.70 on November 23 as Solana ETF regulatory filings surged after Gary Gensler confirmed his departure from the SEC. SOL lost some ground since reaching its ATH and is now the 6th largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $91.87 billion, currently trading for $191.53. Ripple (XRP) Ripple’s XRP has gained massively over the past month and is now the fourth-largest crypto with a market capitalization exceeding $122 billion. Ripple (XRP) has witnessed a spectacular gain in value after news of Gary Gensler’s planned exit surfaced. Ripple Labs has been embroiled in a highly publicized legal battle with the securities agency for which Ripple paid a hefty price. In 2020, the regulator sued Ripple for its supposed breach of securities laws, resulting in many exchanges, such as Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp, and Gemini, choosing to delist XRP. Ripple finally found some relief after a partial victory in 2023 ended the SEC’s 3-year-long crusade against the company. The Southern District of New York Court delivered a partial victory to Ripple in its matter with the SEC after Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple’s XRP token is “not necessarily a security on its face.” Ripple received some further bullish news after Chris Giancarlo, former chair of the CFTC, predicted the SEC would drop its case against the company. The price of XRP surged further after WisdomTree filed an S-1 application for a spot XRP ETF. Husky Inu (HINU) to Thrive With renewed optimism and interest in the crypto market since Donald Trump’s election win, crypto projects are expected to surge as the president-elect plans to implement pro-crypto policy. Husky Inu (HINU), the latest memecoin sensation from the Solana network, will surely reap the rewards of industry news. Husky Inu recently launched the presale of its native token, HINU , with tremendous success, and the two are on a mission to conquer the memecoin industry through a robust and supportive community with innovative features and enhanced rewards. Since going live, the presale has generated over $680,000, with numbers expected to rise rapidly as the crypto market explodes. Husky Inu is working on some exciting things, including an Earn App and a Decentralized Exchange. The Earn App will reward users with HINU tokens for engaging with the project, and the Decentralized Exchange will facilitate decentralized trading to improve utility and value for HINU holders. Husky Inu boasts several unique features that set it apart from traditional investment opportunities, including a capped token supply, a deflationary mechanism, speedy transactions, and charity voting. Husky Inu is close to hitting its fundraising target, so investors are urged to hurry before missing the opportunity to take a stake in this exciting project.

38278840,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53384,1735503326,Just a Chill Guy Old News? BTFD Ongoing Viral Meme Coin Presale With BIG50 Bonus Is Multiplying Gains Like A Champ,"The world of meme coins has always been a wild ride, but there’s something about the way BTFD Coin (BTFD) has captured the crypto community’s attention that’s setting it apart from the pack. Let’s face it, meme coins aren’t just jokes anymore. They’ve evolved into serious opportunities for investors looking to catch a ride on something big. Whether you’re new to crypto or you’ve been around for a while, you’ve probably heard about BTFD’s ongoing viral meme coin presale. The thing is, the hype is real—like, really real. With a gaming ecosystem, staking rewards, and an active referral program, BTFD Coin is paving the way for meme coins to reach the next level of success. This presale is turning heads and could very well be the ticket to multiplying your gains. Meanwhile, some meme coins, like Just a Chill Guy (JACG), are starting to show signs of slowing down. Sure, it had its moments of fame, but its presale isn’t seeing the kind of explosive growth that BTFD is enjoying. Why is that? Well, BTFD Coin has managed to captivate a much broader audience with its innovative approach and attention-grabbing rewards, and that’s why it deserves a closer look. In this article, we’ll dive into why the BTFD presale is causing so much buzz and why Just a Chill Guy may have missed the boat. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Revolutionizing Crypto If you’re familiar with meme coins, you know they’ve become a staple in the crypto community, making headlines for their wild price fluctuations and crazy success stories. But not all meme coins are created equal, and that’s where BTFD Coin shines. In its ongoing viral meme coin presale, BTFD has caught the attention of investors and crypto enthusiasts alike with its stellar presale performance and innovative features. First off, let’s talk about BTFD Coin’s presale. It started at a minuscule $0.000004 per coin, but today, as of Stage 13, the price has risen to $0.000142. That’s great growth from the beginning! And the best part? The presale is far from over. The BTFD Coin presale has raised over $4.6 million, with over 60 billion coins sold to more than 7000 holders. The presale has already reached over half its journey, and with four stages still to go, the hype is only getting bigger. So, what’s driving all this excitement? One key factor is the Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that’s being built into the BTFD ecosystem . The beta version of the game launched in Stage 10, and while you can’t earn rewards just yet, the fact that it’s live already gives a sneak peek into what’s coming. The P2E game will allow users to earn rewards while having fun, giving them a new way to engage with the BTFD Coin ecosystem. But it doesn’t stop there. BTFD Coin also offers a 90% Annual Percentage Yield (APY) on staking. That’s huge. Investors can put their coins to work and watch their holdings grow with minimal effort. On top of that, the referral program offers another way to earn, rewarding users who bring new investors into the fold. So if you’re sitting on the sidelines, now is the time to hop in and make the most of the ongoing viral meme coin presale while it’s still hot. The Bulls Squad is another cool feature that helps foster community engagement. Investors who get involved can become part of an exclusive group that receives special updates, rewards, and more. In short, BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme coin—it’s building an entire ecosystem that blends entertainment, rewards, and community. Analysts are predicting that the price could go as high as $0.0006 by the end of the presale, meaning there’s still a ton of upside potential if you get in now. Just a Chill Guy: A Meme Coin That’s Running Out of Steam Now, let’s talk about Just a Chill Guy (JACG), another meme coin that had a fair bit of buzz when it first launched. Sure, it has its fanbase, and it’s still hanging around, but let’s be real—the presale numbers just don’t compare to BTFD Coin’s meteoric rise. While Just a Chill Guy has had its moments in the spotlight, it seems like the momentum is slowing down as BTFD Coin steals the show. JACG’s presale has struggled to capture the level of excitement that BTFD Coin has generated. The presale hasn’t seen the same kind of explosive growth, and it hasn’t managed to secure the same kind of attention from investors looking for something fresh and exciting. With BTFD offering a much more compelling value proposition with staking rewards, its P2E game, and its strong community support, JACG just doesn’t hold the same appeal. Another factor that sets BTFD Coin apart is its focus on long-term growth. While meme coins can often be one-hit wonders, BTFD Coin is built to last. Its emphasis on a diverse ecosystem of rewards, including staking and the play-to-earn game, gives it a level of stability and sustainability that other meme coins, like Just a Chill Guy, lack. So, is Just a Chill Guy old news? Well, it’s fair to say that it’s presale isn’t generating the same level of excitement it once did, and as new projects like BTFD Coin continue to rise, it’s looking more and more like Just a Chill Guy’s moment has passed. Investors are always on the lookout for new opportunities, and the ongoing viral meme coin presale for BTFD Coin is definitely catching their attention. The Ongoing Viral Meme Coin Presale: Why You Should Get in on BTFD Now There’s a good reason the BTFD Coin presale has been so successful—it’s providing real value. Meme coins are no longer just for meme lovers. Investors are starting to see them as legitimate opportunities, and BTFD Coin is leading the charge. With the price already rising from $0.000004 to $0.000142, and analysts predicting that it could reach $0.0006 by the end of the presale, the upside potential is massive. So, what’s the best way to get in on the action?

In this article, we’ll take a closer look at BTFD Coin and how it stacks up against Goatseus Maximus. While both projects have their unique charm, BTFD Coin’s robust features and potential for growth make it the one to watch. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Game Changer BTFD Coin is making headlines for its innovative features designed to engage the community while offering real financial incentives. One of the most exciting aspects is the recently launched Play2Earn game , which went live in beta during Stage 10 of the presale. Although rewards aren’t being earned just yet, the anticipation is palpable. Imagine earning tokens while playing a game—talk about a win-win situation! But that’s not all. BTFD Coin also offers an incredible 90% APY on staking, which officially launched on December 2. This means you can earn returns simply by holding onto your tokens. For those looking to grow their investments passively, this is a game-changer. The referral program is another fantastic feature, encouraging community members to bring in new investors. With over 6,700 Bulls already on board, the sense of camaraderie and excitement is growing by the day. Analysts are optimistic about BTFD Coin’s price trajectory. Having raised more than $4.6 million and hitting the $1 million mark in under ten days, the presale is on fire. If you invest $25,000 at the current Stage 13 price of $0.0000142, you’ll acquire around 390 million $BTFD coins. When BTFD lists at $0.0006, your investment could soar to about $234,000! That’s nearly a 836% return, showcasing just how lucrative this ongoing viral meme coin presale this week truly is. In short, BTFD Coin combines fun and profit, creating a unique investment opportunity that shouldn’t be missed. With its P2E game, high staking rewards, and a vibrant community, it’s a top contender in the meme coin arena. Goatseus Maximus: The Quirky Contender Now, let’s dive into Goatseus Maximus. This meme coin has its own unique flair and has gained traction among certain circles. It taps into humor and creativity, similar to BTFD Coin, but it lacks some of the robust financial mechanics that make BTFD appealing. Goatseus Maximus relies heavily on its community-driven initiatives, focusing on social media campaigns and meme-based marketing to keep holders engaged. While Goatseus Maximus has managed to carve out a niche, it hasn’t rolled out significant financial incentives like high APY staking or a P2E game. This could limit its growth potential as investors look for quick returns. The community is indeed loyal, but will it be enough to sustain long-term interest? Analysts have a mixed view of Goatseus Maximus. It’s charming and entertaining, but it may not provide the financial upside that BTFD Coin promises. If you’re wondering whether Goatseus Maximus can still offer value, it’s time to weigh your options. While it’s certainly fun and engaging, it’s hard to ignore the more substantial prospects presented by BTFD Coin. As the crypto market evolves, the ongoing viral meme coin presale this week highlights the stark differences between these two contenders. In conclusion, Goatseus Maximus is a quirky option with a dedicated fanbase, but it may not be the best bet for those looking to capitalize on the potential for quick returns.

38278127,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376482,1735502533,"Access Control Vulnerabilities Cause $1.7B in Losses Across CeFi, DeFi, and Gaming","Access control vulnerabilities have emerged as the leading cause of crypto hack losses in 2024, accounting for a whopping 75% of total damages across decentralized finance (DeFi), centralized finance (CeFi), and gaming/metaverse sectors, excluding phishing attacks. According to Hacken, this marks a significant increase from 50% in 2023, with losses tied to unauthorized access and private key theft surging to $1.7 billion, up from less than $1 billion the previous year. In contrast, exploits targeting smart contract vulnerabilities contributed just 14% of total losses. Access Control Exploits Surge in 2024 Hacken’s report revealed that access control attacks were particularly pervasive across all categories of Web3 in 2024, with CeFi, DeFi, and gaming/metaverse projects being severely impacted. In CeFi, major incidents at DMM Exchange and WazirX resulted in combined losses exceeding $500 million. The DeFi sector also suffered from compromised smart contract management, as seen in the Radiant Capital hack, which caused $55 million in losses. The gaming/metaverse space faced significant damage too, exemplified by the $290 million PlayDapp exploit. At the core of these attacks was private key compromise, stemming from weak key management practices, social engineering, and insecure backup methods. To safeguard against these threats, Hacken outlined that businesses must implement advanced multisig management, automated incident response, and adhere to the Cryptocurrency Security Standard (CCSS) to ensure stronger private key security and reduce operational vulnerabilities across Web3. DeFi Losses Drop But Gaming and Metaverse Still Struggling The DeFi sector saw a notable reduction in total losses in 2024 compared to the previous year. While DeFi-related losses in 2023 climbed $787 million, the 2024 figure saw a 40% reduction which can largely be attributed to improved security measures across the sector, most notably within decentralized bridges. In 2024, DeFi witnessed the improvement of cross-chain operability, which played a crucial role in mitigating bridge exploits. As bridges have historically been top targets for hackers, the reduction in losses – $338 million in 2023 compared to just $114 million in 2024 – demonstrated the growing effectiveness of new security protocols. The report pointed to tools like Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and Zero-Knowledge (ZK) cryptography which have become essential for bridge developers, improving security and making attacks less impactful. These advancements have significantly reduced the frequency and severity of exploits targeting cross-chain bridges. The same can’t be said for the gaming and metaverse sectors experienced significant losses. In 2024, this cohort of Web 3 recorded $389 million in losses which accounted for nearly 20% of all crypto hacks. A large portion of these losses stemmed from access control vulnerabilities. Three major incidents were responsible for $358 million of the total losses which made up more than 80% of the gaming and metaverse hacks for the year. The concentration of these losses in Q1 emphasized the difficulty these projects face in securing access management, particularly on newer platforms like Blast, which also encountered multiple rug pulls.

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/homosexual-pepe-homopepe-solana-memecoin-to-surge-18000-before-exchange-listing-while-shib-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

38278165,https://finbold.com/?p=223955,1735502461,Analysts predict Bitcoin’s price for 2025,"Bitcoin ( BTC ) has had one of its best-performing years in 2024, finally reaching the coveted six-figure valuation with a segment of the market anticipating continued growth in the coming months. The asset’s rise has been driven by multiple factors, with the approval of the spot exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) in the United States serving as a major catalyst early in the year. Most recently, Bitcoin surged to a record high of $108,000, fueled by post-election optimism following Donald Trump’s victory. His stance on pro- cryptocurrency policies has led many to expect further market gains. As of press time, Bitcoin is trading at $93,450, reflecting a 121% rally year-to-date. Bitcoin YTD price chart. Source: Finbold Looking ahead to the new year, several key factors could support Bitcoin’s upward momentum. A significant one will be watching whether Trump follows through on his promises to the cryptocurrency space. The president-elect has supported the idea of a Bitcoin reserve, though details about the government’s potential holdings and the reserve’s purpose remain unclear. Any new developments in this area will likely play a pivotal role in shaping Bitcoin’s price movements. Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 With this in mind, several analysts and institutions have offered projections for the maiden cryptocurrency price 2025. Top on the list is banking giant Standard Chartered , which projects Bitcoin is likely to trade at $200,000 by the end of 2025, a price target that would put the asset’s market cap near the $4 trillion mark. Geoff Kendrick, the bank’s Global Head of Digital Assets Research, said institutional investors would drive the $200,000 valuation, with inflows maintaining or surpassing 2024’s pace. Analysts at VanEck also have a cautiously optimistic outlook for Bitcoin in 2025, projecting a record high of $180,000. However, they anticipate significant volatility throughout the year. In a December 13 report , analysts Matthew Sigel and Patrick Bush stated that Bitcoin will likely experience a 30% price drop after reaching new highs early in the year. Following this, the market will likely undergo a period of consolidation in the summer before a final price surge toward the end of 2025. “We believe the crypto bull market will persist through 2025, reaching its first peak in the first quarter. At the cycle’s apex, we project Bitcoin to be valued at around $180,000,” the analysts noted. At the same time, Deepwater Asset Management expert Gene Munster also foresees Bitcoin surging past the $100,000 mark. The analyst stated that “ripe market and regulatory conditions will send Bitcoin to new highs in 2025, with likely pullbacks occurring before its peak.” Impact of Bitcoin reserve on BTC price On the other hand, some experts have shared the possible impact of a Bitcoin reserve on the cryptocurrency’s price in 2025. For instance, Jeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise Asset Management, has forecasted a potential Bitcoin price of $1 million in 2025. However, he places the chances of this milestone at under 10%. Park attributes this slim probability to the possibility of the U.S. government establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve, which he believes is a key factor for such a dramatic price surge. Here is a simple illustration of how probability math works– Bottom right looks most probable to me, ie. 2.5% chance. pic.twitter.com/KCsqHGnFMu — Jeff Park (@dgt10011) December 26, 2024 Elsewhere, Bitcoin’s price could soar to $500,000 if the national reserve is established, according to Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer of Bitwise Asset Management. Hougan also forecasted that Bitcoin could reach $200,000 in 2025, driven by growing demand for the digital asset. “If we do get a Bitcoin strategic reserve where the government is buying Bitcoin … $200,000 bitcoin is going to be looking quaint. You’re going to be looking at $300,000, $400,000, $500,000 bitcoin. It’s just too big a story, because governments all around the world are going to have to do it,” Hougan said. On the dissenting part, Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz is skeptical that a Bitcoin reserve will happen soon. However, if the US government moves toward mainstream cryptocurrency adoption, he expects Bitcoin’s price to surge to $500,000, with other countries likely following suit. While price projections vary, ranging from cautious optimism to bold forecasts, institutional interest and regulatory developments, such as the creation of a Bitcoin reserve, are likely to influence the market.

In the last 24 hours, the network has experienced a remarkable 40% increase in the value of significant transactions, surpassing $23 billion.

Should external catalysts align, the incremental upward movement could serve as a catalyst for more aggressive price action. Some optimistic predictions are valid. Dogecoin has surprised the market with huge gains. Skepticism remains necessary. Many experts caution against using previous performance to predict future success.

On the one hand, past price trends and the growing activity of whales support the legitimacy of such bold forecasts. For this to be accomplished, we need a perfect storm of favorable circumstances, including broad adoption, a strong bull market, and the undivided attention of prominent investors like Elon Musk.

In an interview with The Business Times, MAS managing director Chia Der Jiun says stablecoins have immense potential provided that regulations are in place to keep the crypto assets from straying from their linked value. “Stablecoins have features that provide more value stability, with the potential to become a widely used payment instrument. MAS sees good potential in stablecoins provided they are well-regulated to have a high degree of value stability. To this end, MAS finalized a regulatory approach for stablecoins, focusing on regulating the value stability risk of single-currency stablecoins.” The MAS says it’s looking to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins in an effort to protect users and consumers. “We are working on the necessary legislative amendments to the PS (Payment Services) Act to implement the stablecoins framework. Only stablecoin issuers that fulfill all requirements under the framework can apply for their stablecoins to be regulated by MAS as ‘MAS-regulated stablecoins.’ This will allow the market to differentiate these stablecoins from other types that are not regulated for their value stability.” The MAS also says that issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) – a stablecoin pegged to a nation’s currency issued by its reserve bank – is currently not needed at this time as cashless payments in the country are already efficient. “MAS has assessed that the case for issuing a retail Singapore dollar CBDC in Singapore is not compelling at this juncture, as electronic payments in Singapore are quite pervasive, seamless and efficient.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Here’s What to Expect from DOGE Price Rally appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Dogecoin trades without major variations as the rally remains between $0.33 and $0.31 for over a week. This indicates a major drop in volatility, due to which a major shift in the trader’s attention has been recorded away from the token. Despite this, the token has driven huge interest in the whales more than market participants, as they have been quietly accumulating over 90 million DOGE in the past few days. This accumulation indicates the whales are trying for a huge DOGE breakout by mounting a buying spree. Interestingly, these accumulations by the whales do not appear to hold the token for a long time, as they could initiate a significant pullback soon. As per the data from Coinglass, a huge cluster of liquidation leverage has been accumulated at $0.42 & later at $0.49 The data suggests more than $70 billion has been leveraged between $0.41 and $0.43, which turned into a strong resistance level. Therefore, it appears that the whales are seeking high-liquidation areas to swiftly execute short trades around these levels. If the price manages to sustain and secure above these levels, then the token could encounter another resistance between $0.485 and $0.5 where more than $50 billion has been accumulated. What’s next? Will the DOGE price ever reach $0.5? The historical DOGE price chart suggests the token is repeating its previous trend but the technicals display a diverse trend, which is concerning. Although the price is deviating similarly as before, the MACD suggests a drop in the buying pressure. On the other hand, the token’s accumulation seems to have lowered with a slight rise in the distribution levels. Hence, this suggests a potential drop in the coming days, just below $0.3, that may attract a huge liquidation pushing the price towards the higher targets. Previously, when the Dogecoin price triggered a breakout in 2021, the market turned bullish and initiated a bull run. Therefore, watching whether history repeats and the potential impact of the breakout over the market would be interesting.",NEGATIVE,DOGE,ALTCOIN | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/are-dogecoin-whales-setting-a-trap-above-0-4-heres-what-to-expect-from-doge-price-rally/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Hedera’s enterprise-grade solutions and strong backing make it a worthy addition to the Best Altcoins with 1000X Potential. 5. Litecoin: The Digital Silver Litecoin has long been known as Bitcoin’s “younger sibling,” but it stands tall with its focus on speed and affordability. Recent upgrades, like the introduction of the MimbleWimbleExtension Block (MWEB) for enhanced privacy, have reinvigorated interest in Litecoin. Litecoin’s reliability, longevity, and continuous innovation make it a strong contender for significant gains. 6. Filecoin: Revolutionising Decentralised Storage Filecoin is tackling the global demand for secure, decentralised data storage. Its platform incentivises users to provide storage space, creating a distributed network that’s more secure and cost-effective than traditional cloud storage. Recent advancements in its ecosystem have drawn both developers and enterprises to explore its potential. Filecoin’s pioneering approach to decentralised storage solutions places it among the Best Altcoins with 1000X Potential .

38277033,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634550,1735500050,Experts warn of AI risks escalating in 2025,"The AI sector was on the top in 2024, pushing Nvidia forward and raising the company’s shares to 183% to briefly pass Apple as the most valuable company in the world. Experts and analysts are now discussing what will be in store for AI in 2025, and it’s not all cheery. From groundbreaking technologies to energy crises, 2025 may bring along dramatic shifts in the AI landscape. Parapsychologist Athos Salome from Brazil, otherwise known as the “Living Nostradamus,” foresees a global event that will demonstrate that AI has unchecked autonomy in areas such as cybersecurity and transportation. Let’s say Salome has a pretty eerie track record with her predictions, including the COVID-19 pandemic and Queen Elizabeth’s death. Meanwhile, Stanford researchers predict 2025 will see a leap forward not to human-directed AI agents but to AI agents that arise independently without human input. However, James Zou, a Stanford professor, has a more rational vision of an ‘AI plus human’ partnership aimed at improving reliability and performance. He said, “I’m particularly excited about the potential of hybrid collaborative teams where a human leads a group of diverse AI agents.” AI will leave us held hostage by the electricity crisis In TheStreet Pro post, hedge fund veteran Doug Kass warns that energy shortfalls are coming because AI data centers are straining power grids . As natural gas prices, utility costs, and public reaction to AI increase, Kass warns about AI-related taxes worth a lot of money. According to Kass, “Nvidia’s ‘day in the sun’ abruptly ends, and the share price falls to between $50-$75 in a matter of days” due to the lack of a “killer app” or lucrative applications of generative AI. Therefore, consumers will be pressured to “help corporations cut costs.” He says this transitional result will benefit tech integrators and harm Microsoft’s and other hyperscalers’ shares, such as Amazon and Meta.

Currently, the Oceania country has a record of 1,359 Bitcoin ATMs operating in its jurisdiction. This figure represents almost 3.5% of all crypto ATMs in the world. It also brings the country closer to Europe’s BTC ATM total, with the possibility of surpassing the continent’s record in no time. Australia now comes third, after North American countries, the United States, and Canada. Surprisingly, this comes amidst the unfavorable crypto market conditions in the US. North America Holds 90% of Bitcoin ATMs The US boasts 31,568 Bitcoin ATMs, and Canada has about 3,114. Notably, the number of Bitcoin ATM in the US represents about 81.3% of the global count. At the same time, Canada’s total market is 7.8%. Hence, the North American market houses up to 90% of the total Bitcoin ATM holdings. Europe is left with about 4%, and so is Oceania. Meanwhile, Asia has one of the smallest percentage, boasting of only 0.9%. Brazil in South America also recorded a slight surge in the number of Bitcoin ATMs earlier in December. Bitcoin ATM Scams on the Rise As the number of BTC ATMs increases globally, so does the volume of Bitcoin ATM-related scams. Two weeks ago, Bitcoin ATM provider Byte Federal revealed a serious data breach that may have exposed the personal information of 58,000 customers. Though the incident occurred on September 30, the company did not discover until November 18, nearly two months later. The perpetrator exploited a vulnerability in the popular developer platform GitLab to access Byte Federal’s network without permission. Once in, they stole sensitive information, which includes customers’ names, addresses, phone numbers, Social Security numbers, government-issued IDs, transaction details, and even user photographs. US Authorities Advise Bitcoin ATM Users to Maintain Caution Authorities are looking for such attackers and have warned the crypto community to remain vigilant. In September, the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sounded the alarm on a sharp rise in BTC ATM scams . It linked the fraudulent activities to the tenfold rise in the number of these machines since 2020. “Neither Bitcoin nor the ATM will protect your money. No cryptocurrency will. There’s no such thing as a government Bitcoin account or digital wallet,” the FTC emphasized.

This article delves into these lesser-known digital assets that could yield significant returns. Uncover which coins are set to make remarkable strides and why they might be the next big opportunity in the crypto market. Graphite Token (@G): Powering the Blockchain That Could Topple Ethereum and Solana Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) have had their time in the spotlight. Now, Graphite Token (@G) is here, bringing with it the power of the Graphite L1 blockchain designed to make crypto simpler, faster, and more rewarding for everyone. Could this be the next big thing to follow Ethereum’s legendary 4,000X growth? The secret to life-changing crypto profits lies in spotting the next hidden gem before the crowd. History shows that early adopters of projects with real utility reap massive rewards: Solana started at $0.04 and skyrocketed to nearly $300 — a staggering +7,500%. Ethereum launched below $1 and climbed to around $4,000 — an insane +400,000%. The secret to their growth? Utility. The more people use them, the more valuable their tokens become. But times have changed, and these blockchains aren’t cutting it anymore. Discover SOL and ETH Challenger for 4,000X Profit Potential What’s Wrong with Ethereum and Solana? Older blockchains face growing challenges like rising fees, complexity, regulatory uncertainty, and questions about reliability. Take Solana, which occasionally experiences network outages, or Ethereum, which saw a significant reduction in its burn rate in 2024. Between unpredictable gas costs, unsatisfactory speed, and unreliable service, users are starting to look elsewhere. The dominance of the “old guard” is fading. What Graphite Brings to the Table Graphite is built to address the challenges of older blockchains with a set of practical features. Direct Rewards for Entry-Point Nodes Graphite has something no other blockchain offers. It lets entry-point nodes earn 50% of transaction fees passing through their nodes, so literally anyone contributing to its operations can earn a share. Transparent, Trust-Based Interactions Graphite’s reputation-based system introduces a Trust Score, a measure of user credibility similar to a credit rating in TradFi. This approach enhances transparency while keeping user privacy within the network where interactions are built on trust. Fair Fees, Fast Speed, and High Scalability Powered by the PoA Polymer 2.0 Algorithm, Graphite keeps fees plain and as low as possible by minimizing computational and energy costs. The network processes up to 1,400 transactions per second with confirmation times under 10 seconds, delivering a perfect balance of speed, cost-efficiency, and reliability. Security as a Top Priority Graphite enforces a one user - one account policy to safeguard its network against fraud and scams. Additionally, it offers an optional KYC verification procedure with three tiers of off-chain checks powered by ZKP to ensure compliance while protecting user data. With transaction filters, users can choose to interact only with accounts that meet specific KYC levels, adding an extra layer of security. Is This Your Chance to Get in Early? The Graphite blockchain is secure, transparent, scalable, and cost-efficient, making it the go-to choice for developers and users alike. With its practical approach and early adoption potential, Graphite is a project worth watching. For those looking to get in early, Graphite offers an opportunity to be part of a blockchain that’s designed for long-term growth and usability. Will it deliver 4,000X gains? Time will tell, but the foundation is strong. This could be your shot at 4,000X profits — Don’t miss out! OM: MANTRA - A Security-Focused Blockchain Bridging Institutions to Web3 OM: MANTRA is a new blockchain that puts security first. It meets real-world regulatory requirements, making it suitable for institutions and developers. Built using the Cosmos SDK, it's compatible with IBC and supports CosmWasm.

It offers built-in modules, SDKs, and APIs to create, trade, and manage regulatory-compliant real-world assets. The user experience is improved to help non-native users and institutions move into Web3. With its permissionless blockchain for permissioned applications, MANTRA aims to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized world. Polkadot (DOT): Connecting Blockchains for Seamless Transactions Polkadot is a decentralized protocol and cryptocurrency known as DOT. It enables secure communication between different blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin without intermediaries. This allows value and data to be shared smoothly across chains. Using parachains, Polkadot enhances speed and scalability, handling more transactions than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The DOT token is used for governance and staking within the network. Holders can take part in the protocol's development and transaction verification. Created by Gavin Wood, a co-founder of Ethereum, and maintained by the Web3 Foundation, Polkadot aims to make blockchains more interconnected and efficient.

It handles a high number of orders per second, with a transaction finality of 380ms. The platform seeks security backed by large institutions and is built with a deep commitment to security. By focusing on trading, Sei offers exchanges an infrastructure tailored to their needs, potentially enhancing their performance in the blockchain market. Introducing Aptos: A Scalable and Safe Layer-One Blockchain Aptos is a new layer-one blockchain designed to be scalable, safe, and reliable. It aims to solve the problems of high transaction fees and network congestion seen in some existing blockchains like Ethereum before its Proof-of-Stake transition. Developed by Aptos Labs, founded by core contributors from Diem (a Meta initiative), it uses a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Aptos focuses on scalability and uses the Move programming language for its smart contracts, highlighting safety and flexibility. It supports a broad range of Web3 applications. As interest in scalable blockchain solutions grows, Aptos presents technology that addresses key challenges in the crypto space. Conclusion While coins like OM, DOT, SEI, and APT show potential, they may offer less immediate gains. In contrast, Graphite Token (@G) stands out as a unique opportunity. It powers the Graphite L1 blockchain, which aims to make crypto simpler and faster. Graphite addresses issues like high fees and network outages seen in older blockchains. It offers fair transaction costs and a Trust Score system based on reputation. Its reward model lets entry-point nodes earn 50% of transaction fees. With strong security from Polymer 2.0 and optional KYC verification, Graphite seeks to set new standards for reliability. For early adopters, it presents a chance to benefit from a project designed for lasting utility and growth. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

Bitcoin (BTC) continues to show its staying power, Ethereum (ETH) remains a leader with its real-world applications, XRP is making waves with its cross-border payment capabilities, and Chainlink (LINK) has carved out a niche by providing essential infrastructure for decentralized systems. If you’re considering stepping into crypto—whether for the first time or as a seasoned trader—it’s worth exploring why these assets are generating so much attention. Plus, navigating the market with secure and user-friendly platforms can make all the difference when it comes to simplifying the buying process. Mass Adoption Could Drive Bitcoin (BTC) Price Higher Bitcoin has cemented its status as the premier cryptocurrency, with its unmatched scarcity and institutional appeal driving sustained interest. As the original digital asset, Bitcoin’s fixed supply and halving cycles have established it as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, akin to digital gold. The rise of institutional adoption, including Bitcoin ETFs, has further legitimized its place in the global financial system, while macroeconomic shifts continue to enhance its appeal as a decentralized store of value. With proposals like the U.S. Bitcoin Reserve gaining traction, Bitcoin is increasingly positioned not just as a speculative asset but as a strategic cornerstone for investors and nations. In a market where trust and utility are paramount, Bitcoin remains unrivaled—its scarcity, resilience, and growing adoption reinforcing its status as the cryptocurrency to hold in 2025 . Ethereum (ETH) Anticipates Uptrend Boosted by Widespread Utility Ethereum (ETH) stands as a cornerstone of the blockchain ecosystem, offering unparalleled utility. As the leading platform for decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and decentralized finance (DeFi), Ethereum continues to evolve through groundbreaking upgrades like Dencun and the upcoming Pectra, which enhance scalability, efficiency, and user experience. Institutional adoption is accelerating, with Ethereum ETFs gaining traction, and regulatory clarity around staking could further solidify its position as a yield-generating asset. Additionally, macroeconomic factors, including lower interest rates and global blockchain activity growth, are poised to enhance its appeal. Despite rising competition, Ethereum’s dominance in DeFi and NFTs, coupled with its vast developer community, ensures its continued relevance. With its robust ecosystem and forward-looking technological advancements, Ethereum stands out as a cryptocurrency to hold in 2025. XRP Could Benefit from SEC Lawsuit Resolution XRP has carved out a niche in the global payments space. Ripple’s efforts to transform cross-border transactions with its fast and affordable network have made XRP an important tool in the financial world. One thing that could be a real game-changer is the potential resolution of Ripple's legal battle with the SEC . If that uncertainty gets cleared up, it could pave the way for more institutional adoption and give investors a much-needed confidence boost. Ripple's plans to roll out RLUSD, a stablecoin tied to the dollar, show how committed they are to growing the XRP ecosystem. Additionally, the prospect of XRP-focused ETFs could introduce significant capital inflows and mainstream access, reinforcing its market position. This could make XRP an even more appealing cryptocurrency to hold in 2025 . Expansion of Chainlink (LINK) Ecosystem Could Fuel Its Price Growth Chainlink (LINK) is the leading decentralized oracle network that enables smart contracts to securely interact with real-world data, a function vital for blockchain’s integration into traditional finance and decentralized applications. The recent developments like the Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) and the expansion of the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) are set to enhance scalability and cross-chain connectivity, attracting widespread adoption. Partnerships with major financial institutions like Swift and DTCC underscore Chainlink's growing role in tokenizing real-world assets, further solidifying its market relevance. With continuous technological innovations and a growing ecosystem, Chainlink plays a key role in the blockchain's future. Its utility, scalability, and institutional integration position LINK as a must-hold cryptocurrency for 2025. How to Buy BTC, ETH, XRP, or LINK?

They’ve built massive fan bases and made headlines, but an analyst has cast doubt on their chances of reaching the $1 milestone by early 2025. While these meme coins may struggle to deliver such gains, PropiChain , an emerging altcoin is stealing the show with its innovative features and real-world potential. And yes, this altcoin could hit $1 long before Dogecoin or Shiba Inu even come close. So, what makes PropoChain stand out? Let’s dive in. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu: The Limitations of Meme Coins Dogecoin has had an incredible journey. What started as a meme has turned into a top cryptocurrency used for tipping, online payments, and even buying Tesla merch. But here’s the issue: Dogecoin doesn’t have much to offer beyond its hype. With a massive circulating supply and no game-changing technology to back it up, hitting $1 is a tough sell anytime soon. Similarly, Shiba Inu, another meme-inspired cryptocurrency, has faced challenges despite its efforts to build utility through the Shibarium layer-2 network and token-burning mechanisms. Analysts argue that these developments, while commendable, may not be sufficient to drive the coin to a $1 valuation due to its massive token supply and market saturation. Here’s where PropiChain enters the picture. This innovative altcoin isn’t about memes or viral trends; it’s about delivering real value and utility. Its advanced features and practical applications in the blockchain ecosystem makes it a strong contender to achieve significant price milestones sooner. PropiChain’s Tokenomics and Presale Appeal to Investors Right now, PropiChain is in stage 2 of its presale, with tokens priced at just $0.011. That’s an incredible deal for a coin that’s already making waves in the crypto world. To put this in perspective, if you invest $1,000 in PropiChain today, you’d get around 90,909 tokens. If (or when) the token hits $1, that initial investment could grow to $90,909. That’s the kind of return every crypto investor dreams about. And it’s not just the presale price that’s exciting; PropiChain recently got listed on CoinMarketCap , boosting its visibility and credibility. On top of that, the platform passed a security audit , so investors can trust the safety of their funds. PropiChain: Revolutionizing the Crypto Space with Unique Features So, what sets PropiChain apart from meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The answer lies in its innovative features and real-world applications. Take fractional ownership, for example. This feature allows you to invest in high-value real estate assets without needing a fortune. You can own a fraction of these assets, making wealth-building more accessible to everyone. Then there’s PropiChain’s focus on the metaverse. Imagine owning virtual properties or trading digital assets in a secure, decentralized environment. PropiChain is making that possible, and with the metaverse rapidly growing, this is a market with immense potential. And let’s not forget the platform’s AI-driven algorithms, which optimize asset allocation and ensure smarter investment decisions. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a crypto newbie, these tools can help you get the most out of your portfolio. Unlike Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, which rely on community-driven hype, PropiChain is solving real problems and opening new doors for investors. Conclusion PropiChain’s strong tokenomics, focus on security, and practical applications make it a standout in a crowded market. And the timing couldn’t be better. With tokens priced at $0.011 during the presale, early investors stand to gain the most. Even a modest investment now could yield life-changing returns as the project grows. While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have their appeal, it is clear they’re facing significant hurdles to reaching $1 anytime soon. PropiChain, on the other hand, has all the ingredients to get there faster: innovation, utility, and a growing community of believers. Now is the perfect time to get in.

New Year Buzz Favors ARB and Lightchain AI for 30x Potential,"As the New Year approaches, the cryptocurrency market is buzzing with discussions about potential high performers in 2024. Filecoin (FIL), once a favorite for decentralized storage, is now under scrutiny as analysts debate whether it can regain its $150+ valuation. While Filecoin’s future hinges on adoption and market dynamics, rising stars like Arbitrum (ARB) and Lightchain AI are capturing investor attention with their 30x growth potential. Arbitrum, known for its efficient Layer-2 scaling solution, continues to gain traction in the Ethereum ecosystem. Meanwhile, Lightchain AI stands out with its innovative integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain, offering scalable solutions for industries like logistics, healthcare, and finance. As FIL strives for a comeback, the spotlight shifts to these emerging tokens, making 2024 a critical year for investors seeking transformative opportunities in the crypto space. In this article, we will dive deeper into the factors that could impact Filecoin’s price in 2024 and what potential investors should consider before making a decision. Evolution of Filecoin’s Price Filecoin (FIL) has gone through a wild ride since ͏it first shot up in fame, with its cost reaching over $150 then falling due to market drops. First praised as a decentralized way for safe and quick data keeping, Filecoin’s worth has been changed by varying use rates and wider market feelings. The coin’s cost change shows its past hope and the tough job of keeping up speed in a more busy blockchain world. As 2024 starts analysts are watching if FIL can get back to its old peaks Main things such as better use, network improvements, and team-ups will have a big part in its comeback. While its chance stays, new rivals with fresh ideas, like Lightchain AI and Arbitrum are grabbing the interest of investors. For Filecoin to get back to $150 or more it needs to prove its worth in the changing crypto world. New Year Buzz Around Emerging Tokens As the New Year begins, the cryptocurrency market is abuzz with excitement surrounding emerging tokens poised for exponential growth. Among the most talked-about projects are Arbitrum (ARB) and Lightchain AI , both offering unique value propositions that set them apart in a competitive landscape. Arbitrum, a leading Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, continues to attract attention with its efficient transaction speeds and cost-effective infrastructure, making it a vital tool for developers. On the other hand, Lightchain AI is gaining momentum by merging artificial intelligence with blockchain technology to address real-world challenges across industries like healthcare and logistics. These tokens exemplify the market’s shift toward utility-driven projects with high scalability and transformative potential. With analysts predicting 30x returns, ARB and Lightchain AI are quickly becoming favorites among investors looking to capitalize on the next wave of crypto innovation. Factors to Consider for FIL’s Price in 2024 Several factors will play a critical role in determining whether Filecoin (FIL) can regain its $150+ valuation in 2024. First, the adoption rate of decentralized storage solutions will be a key driver. Filecoin’s ability to attract enterprises and developers to leverage its network for secure and scalable data storage will heavily influence its demand. Second, technological upgrades and enhancements to the network, aimed at improving performance and usability, could reignite interest among investors and users. Third, broader market conditions, such as regulatory clarity and a potential crypto bull run, could create a favorable environment for FIL’s price recovery. However, competition from emerging projects like Lightchain AI and Arbitrum, which offer innovative solutions and scalability, poses a challenge. For FIL to reclaim its former glory, it must reaffirm its utility and differentiate itself in a rapidly evolving blockchain ecosystem. Lightchain AI and Arbitrum Which Is a Better Investment? When comparing Lightchain AI and Arbitrum as investment opportunities, both projects offer unique advantages tailored to different aspects of blockchain innovation. Arbitrum has solidified its position as a leading Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, providing developers with faster transaction speeds and reduced costs. This makes it a go-to choice for dApp builders and institutions looking to optimize Ethereum-based solutions. On the other hand, Lightchain AI stands out with its groundbreaking integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology, addressing real-world challenges in industries like healthcare, logistics, and finance. Its focus on AI-powered solutions through the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) offers unparalleled scalability and utility. While Arbitrum appeals to those prioritizing scalability within Ethereum, Lightchain AI’s presale price and transformative potential make it a compelling choice for investors seeking diversification and exponential growth in emerging markets. So, take presale advantages, along with the potential for transformative scalability and market demand, into account before making an informed decision between these two promising projects.

Prince Elon (ELONPRIN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONPRIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Prince Elon can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Prince Elon could become the next viral memecoin. Prince Elon launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Prince Elon on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Prince Elon by entering its contract address – 7rAsmWGTtPFY9RFnhd9biard7PrWtw5ZigowwfmaXUQ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONPRIN.

XRP: A Fast, Low-Cost Cryptocurrency for Borderless Transactions XRP is a cryptocurrency supported by the XRP Ledger, designed for fast, low-cost, and borderless transactions. It operates on a decentralized system without a central authority, making it secure and resistant to censorship. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was launched with an initial 100 billion supply, with 80 billion gifted to Ripple for further development. Ripple uses XRP to improve network liquidity and support the ecosystem, controlling supply release through escrow. XRP aims to facilitate seamless payment transfers across various currencies. In the current market cycle, XRP's potential lies in its ability to offer quick and affordable cross-border payments, making it an attractive option in the evolving digital economy. PEPE Coin: A Deflationary Memecoin Inspired by Pepe the Frog PEPE is a deflationary memecoin launched on the Ethereum blockchain as a tribute to the Pepe the Frog internet meme created by Matt Furie. Aiming to capitalize on the popularity of meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, PEPE features a no-tax policy and lacks utility, positioning itself purely as a memecoin. In late April to May 2023, PEPE experienced a significant surge, with its market capitalization reaching $1.6 billion, attracting a strong community. While it has induced interest in memecoins, the coin's future potential in the market depends on factors such as the upcoming Bitcoin halving cycle and market sentiment. Its attractiveness in the current market cycle is uncertain but remains a point of interest for investors. Conclusion With the 2024 bull run in full swing, XRP and PEPE show less short-term potential than Catzilla.

Balaji was found dead in his San Francisco home on December 14, with the San Francisco medical examiner's office ruling the cause of death a suicide. But Balaji's mother has publicly disputed that conclusion. In a tweet, she revealed the disturbing details, claiming that her son's apartment had been ransacked, that there were signs of a struggle in the bathroom and that bloodstains suggested he had been beaten before his death. Musk also contributed to the controversy surrounding the incident, saying, “It doesn’t appear to be a suicide.” Despite these claims, authorities reportedly closed the case, labeling it a suicide. The controversy surrounding Balaji’s death has also affected the cryptocurrency market. A memecoin named after Suchir Balaji surged over 280% in the hours following Musk’s comments. The token’s current market cap stands at $16.1 million, revealing the crypto market’s sensitivity to viral news and social media influence. Related News: Whales Clash Over This Altcoin - Two Buy Huge Wallets, One Sells Big However, in the face of such a sad event, creating a memecoin for the situation seems cruel. It should also be noted that memecoins have no intrinsic value and their prices can be reset at any time. Suchir Balaji left OpenAI earlier this year and publicly criticized the organization, accusing it of potentially violating US copyright laws in the development of its ChatGPT chatbot. Musk’s contentious history with OpenAI adds another layer to the story. In March, Musk filed a lawsuit against the organization and its CEO Sam Altman, accusing them of violating an original agreement to develop AI for the benefit of humanity, not for profit. Musk has also criticized OpenAI’s close ties to Microsoft, claiming that the partnership undermines the company’s mission of openness and public interest. *This is not investment advice.

(Bitcoin Price Analysis)","Bitcoin’s price has failed to continue its upward momentum, since dropping below the $100K resistance level. This has led to a lot of uncertainty surrounding the future price action. Technical Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The Daily Chart On the daily chart, the price has been consolidating below $100K, after briefly breaking it to the upside a couple of weeks ago and recording a new all-time high. A few days ago, the market failed to break the $100K level and was rejected to the downside. As a result, the $90K support level is likely the target in the short term. The reaction to this area will determine the short-term price action for BTC. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour timeframe demonstrates a clearer picture of the sideways price action. The market was initially making higher highs and lows inside an ascending channel. Yet, it has since broken the pattern to the downside and retested it twice. With the RSI also showing values below 50%, indicating bearish momentum, the market is likely to drop toward the $90K level before a potential bullish continuation. Source: TradingView Sentiment Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) Open Interest The Bitcoin futures market sentiment has been offering valuable insight over the last few years, helping analysts predict potential volatility in the short term. This chart presents the open interest metric, which measures the total number of open perpetual futures contracts on derivatives exchanges. As the chart demonstrates, the open interest values have been at all-time highs, even though the market has dropped below the $100K level and stopped trending. This can indicate potential volatility in the short-term, caused by liquidation cascades. As a result, investors should be careful when investing in Bitcoin at the moment.

38275848,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376603,1735497928,Calm Before the Storm for XRP? Price Consolidates Above $2 (Ripple Price Analysis),"Ripple is currently experiencing a phase of low volatility, with its price fluctuating within the pivotal $2-$3 range. This consolidation period suggests market indecision, with a breakout likely to define XRP’s next mid-term trend. XRP Price Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Ripple’s price has recently been confined within the $2-$3 range, characterized by low volatility and muted trading activity. This consolidation reflects a cautious market state as participants await a definitive breakout to signal the next directional move. Currently, the cryptocurrency is anchored at the $2 support zone, a level bolstered by historical significance as a prior swing high and a concentration of demand. It is acting as a crucial barrier, halting further downside movement and keeping Ripple within its consolidation range. Adding to the bullish outlook, the RSI indicator has stabilized near 50, indicating equilibrium between buyers and sellers. This positioning creates a foundation for bullish momentum, with the potential for a breakout above the $3 resistance. If this materializes, Ripple could embark on a mid-term upward trend. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, Ripple has been fluctuating within a descending wedge pattern, a formation typically associated with bullish breakouts. The price is testing the wedge’s lower boundary near the critical $2 support zone, where heightened buying activity is expected. This zone is further reinforced by the significant 0.5 ($2)-0.618 ($1.9) Fibonacci retracement levels, underscoring its importance as a robust support area. In the mid-term, the cryptocurrency is expected to sustain its consolidation within the wedge while holding above these key Fibonacci levels. A bullish breakout above the wedge’s upper boundary could propel the price toward the $3 resistance, setting the stage for further advances. Conversely, failure to hold the $2 support may result in a bearish breakdown, potentially driving the price toward the $1.5 threshold, representing the next critical support level.

Solana (SOL) Solana is a blockchain platform built for speed. It aims to support decentralized applications, much like Ethereum and Cardano. What makes Solana stand out is its focus on faster transactions. It offers flexible development options in many programming languages. At the core of Solana's ecosystem is SOL, its own cryptocurrency. SOL is used to make transactions, run custom programs, and reward those who support the network. Solana avoids some common solutions like sharding or second-layer add-ons to achieve scalability. Instead, it uses a high-capacity network to handle many transactions at once. This approach may attract developers and users who need a fast and efficient platform. In today's market, where speed and scalability are important, SOL shows potential. Compared to other coins, Solana's unique technology offers advantages in handling high-activity services without slowing down. PEPE (PEPE) PEPE is a new cryptocurrency that started as a tribute to Pepe the Frog, a meme created by Matt Furie in the early 2000s. Launched on Ethereum, PEPE is a deflationary memecoin that caught the crypto community's attention. In April and May 2023, its value skyrocketed, with its market cap reaching $1.6 billion at one point. Early investors saw huge gains, and PEPE gained a strong following. Its rise sparked a ""memecoin season,"" with other meme coins experiencing wild price swings. PEPE aims to join popular meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. It has a simple approach: no taxes, no complicated features, just meme fun. The team plans to get listed on major exchanges and take over the meme world. In the current market cycle, PEPE's growth shows the power of community and viral trends. While memecoins are risky due to volatility and lack of utility, PEPE's popularity may attract investors looking for the next big thing. As the crypto world waits for the next Bitcoin halving, some believe coins like PEPE could see more gains. Whether PEPE is an attractive investment depends on one's risk appetite and belief in meme magic. Ethena (ENA) Imagine a world where your money isn't tied to a bank but flows freely on the internet. That's the vision behind Ethena. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, Ethena is creating a synthetic dollar—a digital currency that mirrors the value of the U.S. dollar without relying on traditional banking systems. Alongside this, they're introducing the ""Internet Bond,"" a global, dollar-based savings tool accessible to anyone with an internet connection. It's a step toward making finance more inclusive and decentralized. In today's crypto market, Ethena offers something fresh. With growing interest in decentralized finance (DeFi), a bank-free digital dollar is timely. Unlike some stablecoins that depend on banks or reserves, Ethena's approach is purely crypto-native. This could mean fewer risks associated with bank failures or regulatory changes. As the crypto market evolves, Ethena's innovative technology and mission make it an intriguing option for those interested in the future of digital money. Moo Deng (MOODENG) Moo Deng, the adorable pygmy hippopotamus from Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Thailand, captured hearts worldwide when images and videos of her playful antics went viral in September 2024. Known for her cute chubby appearance and energetic personality, she quickly became an internet sensation, spreading joy and smiles across the globe.

Compared to other meme coins, Moon Deng not only brings fun but also leverages the robustness of Solana, positioning itself well amidst current market trends.

XYZ is currently undervalued, and with major listings on the way, presale participants stand to secure life-changing gains. >>>2025 Could Be Your Best Year Yet! Make All Your Wishes Come True with the XYZ winning team! Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin (BTC) emerged in 2009 as the first cryptocurrency, introducing the world to blockchain technology. Created by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin was designed to be a decentralized digital currency, enabling peer-to-peer transactions without the need for banks or central authorities. Instead of physical coins, Bitcoin operates on a distributed ledger across many network nodes. Miners verify transactions by solving complex puzzles in a process called mining, earning new bitcoins as a reward. This system not only facilitates secure transactions but also aims to prevent fraud. As of October 2023, Bitcoin remains a dominant force in the cryptocurrency market. Its limited supply of 21 million coins and the halving event, which reduces miners' rewards by half every four years, contribute to its scarcity. This can affect mining profitability but also adds to Bitcoin's appeal as a deflationary asset. In the current market cycle, Bitcoin continues to attract interest amid global economic uncertainties. Compared to newer coins, it is often seen as a store of value, like digital gold. While the market is volatile, Bitcoin's pioneering technology and widespread adoption keep it at the forefront of the crypto world. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum, introduced by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and launched in 2015, has been a trailblazer in the blockchain world. Pioneering the use of smart contracts, it has fostered a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. Ethereum's network enables the creation of ERC-20 tokens, widely used for governance, utility, and value storage across various applications. The transition to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism with the Merge in 2022 marked a significant milestone, enhancing energy efficiency and paving the way for future scalability solutions like sharding. These developments aim to increase transaction speeds and reduce costs, reinforcing Ethereum's commitment to decentralization and technological advancement. Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum, remains central to the network's functionality. It facilitates transactions, rewards stakers, and serves as a tradable asset and collateral within the ecosystem. Based on historical price movements and Bitcoin halving cycles, some predictions estimate that Ethereum's price could reach a yearly low of $2,700.31 in 2025 and potentially climb to $6,580.53 next year. While these figures offer insights into possible trends, the cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. Ethereum's continuous innovation and key role in DeFi make it a noteworthy contender in the current market cycle. As the blockchain landscape evolves, Ethereum's focus on scalability and efficiency may enhance its appeal compared to other cryptocurrencies. XRP (XRP) XRP is a digital currency aiming to revolutionize how we transfer money. Supported by the XRP Ledger, it offers fast, low-cost, and secure transactions without the need for a bank account. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP began with 100 billion coins. Ripple, the company that champions XRP's development, was gifted 80 billion of these coins. They use XRP to enhance liquidity and support the growing ecosystem. The name XRP comes from ""ripple credits,"" highlighting its mission to enable seamless payments across different currencies. In today's market, XRP's potential is drawing attention. Its technology allows for quick and affordable cross-border transactions, setting it apart from other cryptocurrencies. While Bitcoin and Ethereum have their strengths, XRP's focus on speedy settlements and low fees makes it attractive for everyday use. Market trends show a growing demand for practical digital currencies that solve real-world problems. With its partnerships with financial institutions and commitment to improving global payments, XRP is positioned as a strong contender in the evolving landscape of digital finance. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin started as a lighthearted joke in 2013, featuring a Shiba Inu dog from a popular internet meme. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it was meant to be a fun alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin has no maximum limit, and 10,000 new coins are mined every minute. This makes it plentiful and easily accessible. In 2021, Dogecoin's value skyrocketed, reaching over $50 billion in market cap and joining the top ten cryptocurrencies. This surge was driven by social media buzz and high-profile endorsements, especially from Elon Musk. Dogecoin's rise shows the power of community and how online trends can impact financial markets. While it started as a meme, its growing popularity suggests it could play a bigger role in the crypto world. Compared to other coins, Dogecoin's abundant supply and active community make it unique. In the current market cycle, its potential depends on continued support and interest from users and influencers. Conclusion BTC, ETH, XRP, and DOGE are solid choices, but with the 2024 bull run, XYZ stands out as a sports memecoin aiming for massive growth and community engagement.

Solana avoids some common solutions like sharding or second-layer add-ons to achieve scalability. Instead, it uses a high-capacity network to handle many transactions at once. This approach may attract developers and users who need a fast and efficient platform. In today's market, where speed and scalability are important, SOL shows potential. Compared to other coins, Solana's unique technology offers advantages in handling high-activity services without slowing down. Avalanche (AVAX) Avalanche's AVAX is making waves in the crypto world. This eco-friendly Layer-1 blockchain offers low fees and lightning-fast transactions. It processes up to 4,500 transactions per second, outpacing many rivals. Its unique customizable Subnets let users create their own blockchains. By combining classical and Nakamoto consensus methods, Avalanche achieves transaction finality in less than two seconds. Its three interoperable chains—X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain—handle various operations from transactions to smart contracts. In today's market, AVAX looks promising. The native token, AVAX, is more than just a coin; it's essential for transaction fees, staking, and operating Subnets. This strong utility gives it an edge over many other tokens. With a focus on speed, scalability, and sustainability, AVAX stands out as the market values efficiency and eco-friendliness. Its advanced technology and practical uses position Avalanche as a potential leader in the next wave of blockchain development. Conclusion While SOL and AVAX show strength, XYZVerse's innovative sports-themed memecoin aims for unprecedented growth, potentially making it a standout in the 2024 bull market.

38275400,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=667952,1735497033,Bitcoin On A Rebound? Here Are Key Levels To Watch,"In an exciting development, Bitcoin may finally be undergoing a market rebound according to a recent prediction by crypto analyst Ali Martinez. However, the premier cryptocurrency finds itself in a critical price zone, which holds significant implications for both bullish and bearish market outcomes. Related Reading: Galaxy Research Reveals Bitcoin, Ether And Dogecoin Price Projections In 2025 Crypto Forecast Bitcoin Must Stay Above $93,400 To Retain Bullish Drive In an X video post on December 28, Martinez stated that Bitcoin may be preparing for a price recovery according to certain market indicators. Firstly, the analyst stated BTC was forming a bullish divergence against its relative strength index, This is a classic bullish signal that indicates weakening downward momentum and a potential price reversal is on the horizon. Furthermore, there are 14 million worth of potential liquidations at $95,300. Martinez believed that market makers would target this price zone which represents a significant concentration of leveraged trading positions. Market makers often attempt to eliminate these leveraged positions leading to an increased market liquidity and volatility, on which they can capitalize to make trades at favorable prices. Another market development that supports Bitcoin’s potential rebound is an increase in long traders on the Binance exchange from 53.12% to 64.04%. This indicates that more Binance traders, who Martinez claims have a solid track record, are predicting Bitcoin to soon experience a price rise. Since Martinez’s video post, Bitcoin has moved above $94,800, which the analyst described as a key resistance level to the projected rebound. Bitcoin is now expected to rise further to $95,600 with a potential to trade as high as $98,373 in the short term. However, the market expert cautions that Bitcoin is at a crucial juncture, with any drop below the key support level of $93,400 likely to spark a further decline to $84,000 or even $70,000. This would represent a potential 25% drop from its current price. Related Reading: Crypto Market Remains Greedy Despite Bitcoin Price Crash To $94,000, Is A Recovery Coming? BTC Price Overview At press time, Bitcoin trades at $95,173 following a price gain of 0.93% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, the asset’s trading volume is down by 53.76% and is now valued at $24.76 billion. The premier cryptocurrency has experienced a rather bearish end to 2024 but market optimism remains rather high. Analysts have continuously described 20-30% corrections as part of the bull market setting the stage for stronger price rallies. With 2025 fast approaching, a price surge above the $100,000 resistance remains key to inducing another uptrend with lofty projected targets as high as $350,000 in the new year.

Join the Dogen Army today and conquer the crypto world!🚀 Ethereum: A Leading Proof-of-Stake Blockchain with Growing Potential Ethereum is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain known for smart contracts and a wide range of decentralized applications. It supports decentralized finance and uses Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon to improve transaction efficiency. Ethereum introduced ERC-20 tokens, which are used across various applications, but transactions still require ETH for gas fees. Since its launch in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum has evolved, transitioning to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge in 2022. The upcoming sharding phase aims to enhance scalability and reduce costs. Ether (ETH) remains central, facilitating transactions and rewarding stakers. Based on historical price movements and BTC halving cycles, Ethereum's price predictions suggest potential growth. These developments may make Ethereum attractive in the current market cycle. Bitcoin: The Pioneer Cryptocurrency and Its Potential Today Bitcoin (BTC) is the first cryptocurrency, introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto to enable electronic cash transactions without central authorities. It operates on blockchain technology, a distributed ledger across network nodes, removing intermediaries like banks. Transactions are verified through mining, where miners solve complex puzzles to validate them and earn bitcoins. The supply is capped at 21 million bitcoins. Every four years, a ""halving"" reduces miners' rewards by half, affecting mining profitability. Bitcoin's decentralized nature and limited supply contribute to its potential. In the current market cycle, Bitcoin continues to attract interest as a digital asset with unique features. Conclusion While established coins like ETH and BTC show limited short-term potential, DOGEN appeals to those seeking luxury and success. Expected 700% growth by presale's end and potential thousand-fold returns, DOGEN mirrors tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat. Building a community of alpha leaders, it offers real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

38275376,https://crypto.news/?p=14323097,1735496943,"Solana struggles to break the $250 level, this SOL alternative plans 3,800% price rise","Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solana’s ATH of $263 faded in December, but Remittix offers frustrated investors a new opportunity. Table of Contents Remittix: changing the face of crypto, the face of finance Solana Solana price flounders after crypto rally Conclusion November saw an appreciable crypto rally, and the Solana price breached $263 for its ATH. Sadly, it was short-lived, and December saw the crypto rally flutter away, and the markets took a pounding. Sol advocates are hoping for a Solana price above $250, but right now, the token is not even above $200. Fortunately, frustrated investors have another option: the new PayFi token Remittix. Read more: Ethereum whales are accumulating Shiba Inu and Remittix – here’s why Remittix: changing the face of crypto, the face of finance It’s not an understatement to say cryptocurrency changed how the world looks at money. But crypto has not seen widespread adoption yet, thanks to it not being accepted as a transactional medium by the mainstream. It is not a bold statement to say that Remittix is changing all that, and bringing crypto transactions to the mainstream. Thanks to Remittix’s ingenious protocols, Remittix allows its holders to make crypto-to-fiat payments in over 30 fiat currencies. Before Remittix, cross-border payments took time, were expensive, and required paperwork, if not even foreign exchange agents. A lengthy and costly affair. With Remittix, a near-instant direct-to-bank deposit can be made in a crypto transaction at a fraction of the cost. This is an absolute game-changer in the world of finance, and will open up the global economy to all players everywhere. From an investment point of view, the benefits of Remittix are obvious, and will form an existential threat to tokens like Stellar and XRP and right now, the ongoing Remittix presale is the hottest crypto investment opportunity of the year certainly a better option than Solana. Solana Solana price flounders after crypto rally November was beautiful for long-suffering Solana investors when the Solana price finally hit a new ATH and seemed to reach $300. But the joy was short-lived as a brutal December knocked Solana back to under $180. What knocked Solana back so much? Solana was oversold during the crypto rally, and the Solana price was artificially pumped. The inverse is also true. Right now, the Solana price is artificially low. Profit-taking and market sentiment can drive a crypto rally to artificially low points. Thus, it may not all be bad news for the Solana price, as Coincodex is predicting the token to hit 4500 by August 2025. In TradFi, a 2.5x return in eight months is enormous and unheard of, but as tokens like Remittix have proven, TradFi is old news, and 2.5x is small potatoes in the crypto world, not when presale tokens regularly beat 100x returns after their presales ended. The tokens are traded on the open market. Solana is a great project and will always inch upwards, but investors who are not interested in inches but in miles can look at investing in tokens like Remittix instead. Conclusion A crypto rally is a great place to make great gains, but a crypto rally will end and a market correction can see someone lose their shirt. The low Solana price proves this, as anyone who brought in above $190 is now squirming. The smart investor looks beyond the crypto rally for tokens with great long-term value, and right now, the industry-defining Remittix is making a case for the go-to token of the year. Remittix is now available at $0.0163 directly from their website, making now a better time to buy before the price rises to $0.0167!

TRON (TRX): A Decentralized Platform Empowering Content Creators TRON (TRX) is a decentralized blockchain platform launched in 2017 by the Tron Foundation. Initially based on Ethereum, TRX moved to its own network in 2018. TRON aims to give content creators full ownership rights and rewards by allowing consumers to compensate creators directly, bypassing intermediaries like YouTube and Facebook. The platform supports smart contracts, various blockchain systems, and decentralized applications (dApps). It uses a transaction model similar to Bitcoin's, with transactions recorded on a public ledger. TRON offers developers a way to create dApps and share content without significant transaction fees. Its focus on empowering creators and providing decentralized internet services may be of interest in the current market cycle. Solana's SOL: A High-Speed Platform for Decentralized Applications Solana is a blockchain platform designed for scalability and speed, offering a foundation for decentralized applications alongside competitors like Ethereum and Cardano. Its architecture enables faster transactions and flexible development across multiple programming languages. SOL, the native cryptocurrency of Solana, is central to its ecosystem, facilitating transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding network participants. The coin holds value by underpinning the operation of the Solana network, allowing users access to a suite of projects. Unlike some platforms, Solana avoids sharding or second-layer solutions, aiming to attract developers and investors with its high-capacity network capable of hosting high-activity products and services. In the current market cycle, Solana's technology continues to garner attention for its scalability and efficiency. Bitcoin: The Pioneer Cryptocurrency and Its Potential Today Bitcoin (BTC) is the first cryptocurrency, introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto to enable electronic cash transactions without central authorities. It operates on blockchain technology, a distributed ledger across network nodes, removing intermediaries like banks. Transactions are verified through mining, where miners solve complex puzzles to validate them and earn bitcoins. The supply is capped at 21 million bitcoins.

In the current market cycle, Bitcoin continues to attract interest as a digital asset with unique features. Conclusion TRX, Solana, and BTC have limited short-term potential. DOGEN, however, is designed for those seeking the best in life, embodying luxury and success. Expected to grow 700% by presale end, with potential for huge returns, it follows successful tokens like BONK and Popcat. Building a community of leaders, DOGEN offers real benefits like exclusive campaigns and perks for early adopters.

Uphold Just Sparked Reactions","Uphold, a well-known crypto trading platform, recently announced a significant development involving RLUSD, Ripple’s USD-backed stablecoin, set to commence on January 1, 2025. Uphold’s official X account posted “1.1.25, RLUSD,” captioning Ripple’s logo. This cryptic post has generated considerable interest across the cryptocurrency community, with many wondering what the exchange has planned for the New Year, RLUSD, and XRP. The RLUSD Stablecoin RLUSD, approved by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), is designed with trust and transparency at its core. The stablecoin is backed 1:1 by U.S. Dollar reserves and cash equivalents, with monthly audits conducted by third-party firms. Built on enterprise-grade security protocols and subjected to rigorous independent audits, RLUSD aims to provide a secure and regulated alternative in the stablecoin market. The stablecoin brings many advantages to the XRP ecosystem, and could significantly benefit XRP. What Is Uphold Planning for RLUSD? Uphold was one of the initial launch partners for RLUSD, and in January, the stablecoin will become a key feature of its Rewards Center program. With this integration, Uphold users can earn rewards for buying and holding RLUSD. Current users who have unlocked all three levels of the Rewards Center will receive exclusive 24-hour early access to RLUSD before its official rollout. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Rewards Center is designed to engage users through monthly activities, including app visits, asset deposits, and trading. Once RLUSD is incorporated, users will unlock benefits such as 5% rewards on RLUSD holdings, early access to new tokens, and access to exclusive crypto market insights. This initiative marks a major step forward for RLUSD, positioning it as a contender in the competitive stablecoin landscape. XRP Community Excitement Community responses highlight the excitement surrounding RLUSD’s potential. One commenter on X predicted that RLUSD will take over from USDT and become the new stablecoin standard. Another noted the anticipated benefits of the Rewards Center, stating, “Earn 5% on RLUSD starting January 1, 2025. Uphold isn’t just a digital asset broker. They’re a neobank! Why be anywhere else?” The move also comes at a time of growing scrutiny of stablecoins like Tether (USDT). This stablecoin has faced questions regarding its reserve transparency with some experts suggesting USDT has created a bubble that threatens the stability of Bitcoin and Ethereum. RLUSD’s regulatory compliance and frequent audits could make it a strong competitor in the market. Also, USDT’s downfall could allow XRP to surpass BTC and ETH and take control of the market.

Dogen, Shiba Inu, and Dogecoin are emerging as top contenders. Investors are eyeing these meme coins for their potential to create wealth. Which one might turn ordinary people into millionaires by 2025? This exploration will shed light on the possibilities and help identify the next breakout star. DOGEN Rejoys Big Moment: Trump’s Victory Will Send It to the Moon Guess who is going to join Elon Musk’s moon mission soon? DOGEN, the boldest meme coin for alpha males, is gearing up for take-off as Trump's victory in the recent US election has the entire market euphoric about the prospects of cryptocurrencies, especially meme coins. Donald and Elon are Best Buddies for Meme Coins Donald Trump’s love for crypto is no secret — he’s promised to make the U.S. the global crypto leader in his campaign. And joining him is none other than Elon Musk, the ultimate Dogecoin (DOGE) fan who’s backed the crypto movement and even aligned with Republicans earlier this year. With these two icons fueling the fire, meme coins are set for a wild ride! DOGE Soars 130% in Just One Week! DOGEN will be the Next Star with 500% Surge Following the US election results, Dogecoin (DOGE) has been on a steady rise: from $0.15 to $0.39 in just one week. DOGEN follows the same upward trend, starting at $0.0003 and now trading at $0.0013, a staggering 333% leap.

Flex Hard, Earn Big – DOGEN is Your Power Move! Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency inspired by Dogecoin but operates on the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing its compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous developer Ryoshi, SHIB began with a supply of 1 quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. Buterin's donation of SHIB to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and the burning of 40% of the total supply increased SHIB's visibility. SHIB's integration with Ethereum allows for projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and plans for a future NFT platform and DAO-based governance system. These developments suggest potential for broader utility in the crypto space, making SHIB appear attractive in the current market cycle. Dogecoin: From Meme to Major Cryptocurrency Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency that began in 2013 as a light-hearted alternative to traditional coins, featuring a Shiba Inu dog as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a capped supply, Dogecoin has no maximum limit, and 10,000 new coins are mined every minute. In 2021, its value soared, boosted by social media and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk, making it one of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The coin's abundant supply and active community have made it popular for small transactions and tipping online. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin continues to draw interest due to its strong community support and high visibility in the crypto space. Conclusion SHIB and DOGE have less short-term potential. DOGEN is designed for those who seek luxury and success. Expected 700% growth by presale's end, with potential thousand-fold returns this altcoin season. Following successful tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, DOGEN aims for record-breaking success. Building a community of leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

Even some forecasts hypothesize that if this bullish growth continues, Dogecoin could increase to approximately $1.40, a paradigm shift for the token and its community. Rexas Finance nears $33M presale target: Early investors eye massive gains RXS, currently in Stage 10 of its presale, is selling for $0.150 and is expected to rise to $0.175 at the next stage. That’s a potential staggering increase for early investors. https://twitter.com/rexasfinance/status/1870473818646671546 Rexas Finance has already raised over $31 million of its target $33 million and sold close to 372 million tokens out of the 380 million available, with listings on platforms such as CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. The project has also undergone extensive auditing by Certik to ensure transparency and security for investors. With RXS’s focus on real-world assets and strong presale performance, it becomes a very alluring project to bet upon. Rexas Finance: Could this be your 18,540% ROI opportunity? Predictably, excitement about Rexas Finance is high, especially as the consensus is for some mind-blowing price prediction of up to 18,540%. The growing excitement around RWAs in the cryptocurrency space drives this projection for the token based on its distinct value proposition. With its increasing intersection with traditional finance, blockchain technology will benefit from projects such as Rexas Finance. Considering this, investors are keenly waiting to see how RXS will perform post-presale and whether it can keep up the momentum once it is in exchanges. At the current presale price of $0.150, there is an excellent opportunity for those who want to ride the growth wave. Conclusion Based on the current analysis, Dogecoin is poised for a $1.40 all-time high (ATH). Still, a Dogecoin competitor token that Rexas Finance deals with focuses on real-world assets (RWA) based on its current momentum, where it is completing its presale stages before its schedule. It is poised for a whopping 18540% increase. Turning a few low investments amounts to thousands of dollars. With the next presale stage priced at $ 0.175, savvy investors are advised to visit Rexas Finance’s website and buy into the presale before it skyrockets to the next stage.

The project’s recently launched presale has generated over $680,000 since going live. The altcoin market has had a terrific run in 2024, with memecoins, particularly, seeing explosive returns. One of the newest memecoins gracing the crypto stage is Shiba Inu’s best friend, Husky Inu (HINU). Husky Inu’s (HINU) Popularity Soars The top dogs of the memecoin world have welcomed a new member to the pack: Husky Inu (HINU). The project was created to bring more value and utility to its holders by leveraging the power of the ever-popular Solana blockchain. Husky Inu and its native token, HINU, are trying to conquer the memecoin industry to build a solid and supportive community boasting innovative features and enhanced rewards. Husky Inu recently launched the presale for its HINU token with immense success. Since the HINU presale went live, the project has raised over $680,000, with numbers rapidly growing. Given what the project is planning, Husky Inu’s presale success is no surprise. The project has big things in the works, with plans to launch its Earn App and Decentralized Exchange. Husky Inu’s Earn App will reward users with HINU tokens for engaging with the project and completing simple tasks such as liking, reposting, and sharing content. The project’s DEX will facilitate decentralized trading, improving the utility and value for HINU holders. Why All the Hype Around HINU? Husky Inu prioritizes a reliable token ecosystem through a well-set-out distribution model and a capped max supply. The project has capped its total supply to 100 billion tokens and boasts a unique deflationary supply element. The deflationary aspect means that 50% of all platform fees collected from the upcoming Husky Inu Exchange and DEX will be used to buy and then burn $HINU tokens and, in such a way, reduce the circulating HINU supply. How Can I Join the HINU Presale? Follow the steps below to get your hands on $HINU today: Step 1: Connect a Wallet The presale widget can be found on the top of Husky Inu’s webpage. To get started, users can connect their wallets using various options. Should you encounter any issues or cannot connect, please contact Husky Inu’s official Telegram Channel. Step 2: Select a Network After connecting your wallet, users can join the $HINU presale on the Solana chain. You can purchase $HINU tokens using native currency or with BTC, ETH, BNB, LTC, DOGE, TRX, DASH, BCH, or USDT on Ethereum Tron chains. Step 3: Buy Tokens After completing the first two steps, you can move on to step 3. Specify the amount of BTC, ETH, BNB, LTC, USDT, DOGE, TRX, DASH, or BCH you would like to trade for $HINU, and then approve the transaction in your wallet. Remember that you will not receive tokens immediately during the presale but can claim them once it has concluded.

Bloomberg reports that Elisa Rossi has filed a complaint with the San Francisco Superior Court accusing her ex-husband Stephen Akridge of stealing millions of dollars worth of staking rewards gained from her Solana tokens. Staking rewards are similar to interest earned from a bank deposit. Crypto holders who participate in the staking process lock their assets for a certain period to validate blockchain transactions and earn more tokens as a reward. The complaint says the dispute started after Akridge and Rossi filed for divorce in February 2023. Rossi alleges that from early March to mid-May, Akridge operated and controlled the accounts in issue and received all of the SOL token commissions. Rossi says that Akridge, who served as principal engineer at Solana and is now the CEO of California-based cybersecurity company Cyber Grant, “took advantage of the significant disparity in expertise in cryptocurrencies and blockchain that he possessed.” The value of the tokens in dispute is blacked out in the suit but Rossi says a significant sum is involved. She is seeking damages for claims and contends that Akridge engaged in breach of contract, unjust enrichment and fraud.

38274164,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376510,1735494582,South Korea Experiences Dramatic Rise in Crypto Adoption: 610K New Investors in Nov,"South Korea has experienced a dramatic surge in cryptocurrency adoption. In fact, a new report suggests that more than 15.5 million citizens now hold digital assets which represents roughly 30% of the country’s population. By November 2024, the number of crypto investors had increased by 610,000 compared to October amidst a broader trend of growing market participation. South Korea’s Crypto Market Doubles in Value This surge is closely tied to heightened market activity following US President-elect Donald Trump’s pro-crypto policy announcements, which sparked optimism among investors. The latest report by the Bank of Korea highlighted that, by the end of November, total crypto holdings in South Korea reached 102.6 trillion KRW (worth $69 billion), nearly doubling from the previous month’s 58 trillion KRW (worth $39 billion). The average crypto holdings per person also saw a significant rise, climbing from 3.87 million KRW (worth $2,655) in October to 6.58 million KRW (worth $4,400) in November. This spike in investor engagement is mirrored by a surge in trading volumes, which reached daily averages of $10.2 billion in November, rivaling the combined volumes of South Korea’s main stock markets. In a statement, Rep. Lim Gwang-Hyun noted, “The virtual asset transaction volume is rapidly increasing to a level comparable to that of the stock market. We need to make thorough preparations at the government-wide level to establish sound market transactions that enhance the stability of the virtual asset market and protect the rights and interests of users.” This accelerating pace of cryptocurrency adoption in South Korea has been driven by favorable market conditions as well as growing investor confidence. However, while this rapid growth presents opportunities, it also highlights the need for strong regulatory measures to safeguard investors and ensure market stability, an aspect that South Korean leaders are currently struggling with. Delays in Crypto Taxation It is important to note that South Korea’s long-delayed cryptocurrency tax was postponed once again, now set to take effect in 2027, as announced by the Democratic Party (DP), the largest faction in the National Assembly. This is the third delay since the initiative was first introduced in 2021, with the original deadline for implementation scheduled for January 2022. The DP announced the latest delay on December 1, following tense discussions with the People Power Party (PPP). The former stressed that more time was needed to build a comprehensive framework for the tax and ensure effective regulation of digital assets. Meanwhile, critics argue that small crypto traders may be negatively affected by this delay.

The price found out a strong support and has triggered a rebound but is yet to validate a flip. As a result, some of the market participants remain uncertain about the next price action. But in the wider perspective, the ETH price appears to be more explosive, offering the last opportunity to enter a long trade as it seems to be due for a 100% upswing. Many crypto veterans and analysts believe the ETH price is pretty undervalued at its current price. The token is trading within a bullish pattern in the long term and has been displaying a bullish divergence. This bullish signal is noteworthy and shouldn’t be overlooked. Therefore, the ETH price appears to be primed to go 2x in the coming year, as five upward waves seem to have begun. The weekly chart of Ethereum displays the price trading within an ascending triangle with a huge possibility of going long. As the price has constantly failed to break the resistance at $4000, the levels seem to have become rigid. Hence, a rise from these levels could trigger a massive explosion, elevating the levels beyond the current ATH. However, the timeframe for the breakout remains slightly extended as the buying volume is yet to accumulate. Considering the technicals, the RSI remains incremental while the base & conversion line of the Ichimoku cloud underwent a bullish crossover. This indicates the price may face another rejection at $4000 but the pullback could be restricted above $2500 as the bulls could be holding a significant dominance over the rally. The rebound that may occur then may help the Ethereum (ETH) price to pierce through the $4000 resistance and sustain that it has been failing to do for over a couple of years. However, the rise above these levels may trigger a strong upswing, which may lead the second-largest token towards new highs in 2025.",POSITIVE,ETH,ALTCOIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/ethereum-price-prediction-eth-about-to-explode-may-form-a-new-ath-in-q1-2025/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Rexas Finance combines blockchain unique features with DeFi and real estate tokenization, offering promising returns. Table of Contents Rexas Finance: The Cardano alternative to transform $350 into $70,000 Conclusion One renowned cryptocurrency that innovatively uses blockchain technology is Cardano. However, its slow pace has caused investors to embrace cryptocurrencies with more promise. Rexas Finance (RXS) , a unique blockchain-based platform meant to transform decentralized finance (DeFi) and real estate tokenization, is one exciting choice. Combining modern technologies with practical applications, Rexas Finance offers an unmatched chance to earn excellent returns. You might also like: Rexas Finance poised to be future of RWA tokenization: Fourth presale stage ends earlier than predicted Rexas Finance: The Cardano alternative to transform $350 into $70,000 Although Cardano has been a consistent pick for many investors, its broader blockchain uses have slowed its development compared to niche-oriented initiatives like Rexas Finance. Rexas Finance has positioned itself as a high-growth alternative by focusing on addressing particular practical issues, such as real estate tokenization. Rexas Finance is a better option for investors looking for significant returns because of creative technology, outstanding presale performance, and a committed community. Rexas Finance presents a convincing chance for people trying to optimize their short-term gains that Cardano cannot equal. Leading DeFi invention, Rexas Finance provides a platform combining blockchain technology with actual asset tokenization. It helps investors get honest, open, and quick financial services. By tokenizing physical assets like real estate, Rexas Finance creates new opportunities for investors to profit from usually exclusive markets. Rexas Finance is a unique factor in the real estate and cryptocurrency markets since asset ownership is becoming more democratic. The platform’s goal is simple yet powerful: to use blockchain technology to offer flawless financial solutions. This forward-looking strategy has positioned Rexas Finance to rule the DeFi market and draw significant interest from institutional and retail investors. Reaching stage 11 of its presale, Rexas Finance prices its tokens at $0.175. The presale has been explosive, raising over $33.1 million and selling over 380 million tokens. This result shows investors’ confidence and emphasizes Rexas Finance as a project with great expansion possibilities. Outstanding fundraising on the platform is merely one measure of its possibilities. Already on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, Rexas Finance has increased its profile in the crypto industry. An audit by Certik confirms that the platform satisfies the highest security and openness criteria, verifying its legitimacy. In addition to its real estate focus, Rexas Finance offers advanced DeFi functionalities, including staking, lending, and borrowing. These characteristics allow users to earn and interact with the platform’s ecosystem in different ways. This combination of DeFi and tangible asset tokens distinguishes Rexas Finance from many cryptocurrencies as it lays the groundwork for the next stage of advancement on the blockchain. Rexas Finance has started a $1 million giveaway to involve its expanding community further. This project will reward twenty participants with $50,000 worth of RXS tokens each, generating buzz about it and drawing fresh capital. Such initiatives create a devoted user base and improve the project’s visibility, guaranteeing its ongoing development and success. Investing in the RXS presale offers a chance to get tokens before the price increases. To guarantee a safe transaction and avoid fraud, visit the official Rexas Finance page. Link a wallet — such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet — to the platform and buy RXS with defined tokens, such as Ethereum or USDT. Once the tokens have been purchased, save them in the wallet and monitor the presale stages to stay current on price adjustments and developments. With the present presale price of $0.175, a $350 investment will get around 2,000 RXS tokens. Within 12 weeks of its initial release, analysts estimate RXS might hit $35. This estimate shows a possible 200x return, transforming a small $350 into $70,000. Such fast expansion is rare in the crypto market, so Rexas Finance is a unique and interesting chance. Rexas Finance’s creative platform, excellent presale performance, and mounting community support drive the expected price explosion. Demand for RXS tokens is projected to explode as more investors see the initiative’s promise, raising its value. Conclusion Rexas Finance offers a one-of-a-kind prospect for those looking for phenomenal expansion. Its emphasis on tokenizing actual assets and transforming DeFi sets it ahead in the cryptocurrency scene.

38273656,https://finbold.com/?p=223852,1735493418,This historical trend sets Dogecoin’s path to $4,"Dogecoin’s ( DOGE ) price action appears to be following a consistent historical pattern, suggesting a potential surge of about 1,150% if the formation plays out. Specifically, Dogecoin has historically broken out of prolonged descending triangles, followed by explosive rallies. This pattern suggests the meme coin’s next target could be at least $4, according to cryptocurrency trading expert Ali Martinez, who shared the insights on December 28. DOGE price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Ali_charts From 2014 to 2017, Dogecoin consolidated within a descending triangle for 165 weeks before a breakout drove it higher. A similar pattern occurred from 2017 to 2021, where a 154-week triangle concluded with another breakout, resulting in a rally of over 16,000%. Now, Dogecoin appears poised for its next major move. The current setup spans 183 weeks, with a descending triangle nearing completion. If this fractal repeats, Dogecoin could experience another meteoric rise, potentially reaching $4 at the minimum, with a high target of $23. If DOGE reaches $23, it would likely achieve a market cap of over $3 trillion. While this valuation is ambitious if realized, Dogecoin would become the most valuable digital asset, provided other cryptocurrencies show minimal growth. If this pattern holds in the short term, the immediate key target for DOGE is the $0.50 resistance level. DOGE’s path to double-digit target At the same time, another trading expert, Javon Marks, suggested in a December 28 X post that Dogecoin might be set to reach as high as $20 based on historical performance. According to Marks, Dogecoin’s bull cycles have consistently become larger: the 2017 rally saw a 90-fold growth, while the 2021 phase saw returns of 306-fold. Therefore, if this momentum continues, DOGE could hit $20 in the current bull cycle. DOGE price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Despite the bullish technical outlook , Dogecoin is attempting to recover after a recent downturn, following the general trend in the cryptocurrency market. While technical indicators point to a double-digit valuation, DOGE’s immediate target is to breach the $1 mark . This goal seemed plausible given the current rally, sparked by the post-election optimism following Donald Trump’s election and his close association with Dogecoin promoter and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk . Achieving these levels would require Dogecoin to attract massive market interest, increased mainstream adoption, integration into payment systems, and greater utility beyond speculative trading. DOGE price analysis At press time, Dogecoin was trading at $0.3171, with daily losses of about 1.2%. On the weekly chart, DOGE has dropped 4.68%. DOGE seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold From the current valuation, Dogecoin appears to be positioned for potential long-term gains, supported by its technical setup. This is backed by the fact that DOGE is trading above the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMA), breaking the $0.50 resistance as a key target in the near term.

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/homosexual-pepe-homopepe-solana-memecoin-to-surge-18000-before-exchange-listing-while-shiba-inu-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Meme coins lose momentum as traders shift to Rollblock, with a $7.7M presale and 100x rally potential in 2025. Table of Contents Rollblock replicates memecoin gains with 330% price jump Dogecoin whales liquidate positions after disappointing price action Shiba Inu faces selling pressure as whale unloads 2.15 Trillion tokens Rollblock kicks off GameFi Era after dethroning meme coins Meme coins may have resurfaced during Q4’s bull market but they are losing momentum again before the end of this year. As traders liquidate their DOGE and SHIB positions, they are moving towards more explosive altcoins like Rollblock. Rollblock’s GameFi project has already raised more than $7.7 million in its presale, which is making analysts optimistic about a massive 100x rally on its official launch day. Can Rollblock outshine DOGE and SHIB in 2025? Spoiler alert: market experts are saying yes! You might also like: Rollblock vs Dogecoin vs Cardano: A quest for crypto with higher growth potential in 2025 Rollblock replicates memecoin gains with 330% price jump Rollblock is a new DeFi altcoin that is tapping into the $500 billion per annum global gambling market. Although there is an abundance of iGambling platforms, none of them offer gold standard security to users. Since Rollblock has launched a new GameFi platform with 7,000+ AI-powered games and an Ethereum-backed security system, analysts are already expecting Rollblock to capture a huge market share of the gambling industry by Q1 2025. Despite the downfall of the GameFi market in recent years, Rollblock is marking a massive revolution with its unique project. On Rollblock, users can sign up with a valid email address, make a deposit with any of the 20+ compatible cryptocurrencies and start playing exciting games on Rollblock’s gaming library. Since Rollblock has recently gotten a license from the Anjouan E-gaming Authority, every game on the platform is completely regulated and secure. Aside from security, Rollblock is also offering several kinds of rewards to its loyal community of investors. With the revenue sharing model, traders can earn weekly staking rewards with up to 30% APYs. By becoming a VIP-tier investor during Rollblock’s presale, traders can also get exclusive tiered bonuses based on their RBLK holdings. Given Rollblock’s commitment to reviving trust in the GameFi space, analysts expect Rollblock to record up to 880% gains before the end of its presale stages. For now, RBLK tokens are selling for just $0.043 which is the lowest price it will ever be moving forward from today. Dogecoin whales liquidate positions after disappointing price action Dogecoin’s price has been stuck in the red zone for the past eight days because of a massive liquidation spree. Despite Dogecoin’s significant post-election gains, investors are beginning to lose interest in the meme coin. If Dogecoin continues to face high selling pressure, new altcoins like Rollblock could easily surpass Dogecoin’s gains in Q1 of 2025. Dogecoin is currently trading for $0.363 after a 15.78% intraday decrease. As Dogecoin whales sell their holdings on DEXs, the sudden increase in Dogecoin’s supply has caused a bearish crossover between the 20-EMA and 200-EMA trendlines. Even if Dogecoin attracts new investors during the dip and surges towards a critical Fib level at $0.3732, analysts believe it is still unlikely for Dogecoin’s price to retest the $0.40 level in the next few weeks. Shiba Inu faces selling pressure as whale unloads 2.15 Trillion tokens Shiba Inu is facing massive selling pressure as on-chain data reveals that a Shiba Inu whale holding 2.15 trillion has liquidated their assets. Since Shiba Inu’s price action has remained underwhelming for the past nine days, analysts predict retail traders to start booking profits as well. Shiba Inu is currently trading for $0.00002403 after an intraday increase of 16.22%. Shiba Inu has also fallen below a critical support at $0.00002450 which typically suggests steeper declines in price. As Shiba Inu’s RSI falls into the oversold territory on the SHIB/USDT daily chart, analysts expect Shiba Inu’s price to crash towards the S1 support at $0.00001847 before the start of 2025. Rollblock kicks off GameFi Era after dethroning meme coins Since Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are recording substantial losses, all attention seems to be on Rollblock’s viral GameFi project. As more traders invest in Rollblock during its presale, analysts are projecting a massive demand-induced 100x rally on the token’s official launch day.

For those looking to ride the next big wave in the crypto world, XYZVerse offers a golden opportunity to get in early and potentially secure life-changing gains. Don’t miss out on what could be the most exciting meme coin success story of the new year. PEPE PEPE is a new cryptocurrency that started as a tribute to Pepe the Frog, a meme created by Matt Furie in the early 2000s. Launched on Ethereum, PEPE is a deflationary meme coin that caught the crypto community’s attention. In April and May 2023, its value skyrocketed, with its market cap reaching $1.6 billion at one point. Early investors saw huge gains, and PEPE gained a strong following. Its rise sparked a “meme coin season,” with other meme coins experiencing wild price swings. PEPE aims to join popular meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. It has a simple approach: no taxes, no complicated features, just meme fun. The team plans to get listed on major exchanges and take over the meme world. In the current market cycle, PEPE’s growth shows the power of community and viral trends. While meme coins are risky due to volatility and lack of utility, PEPE’s popularity may attract investors looking for the next big thing. As the crypto world waits for the next Bitcoin halving, some believe coins like PEPE could see more gains. Whether PEPE is an attractive investment depends on one’s risk appetite and belief in meme magic. Shiba Inu Shiba Inu (SHIB) began as a playful nod to Dogecoin but has quickly made a name for itself in the crypto world. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous “Ryoshi,” SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This choice amplifies its compatibility and potential within Ethereum’s extensive ecosystem. Starting with a quadrillion tokens, half were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. His move to donate a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burn 40% of the total supply not only boosted SHIB’s credibility but also garnered global attention. What sets SHIB apart is its ambition beyond being a meme. Its integration with Ethereum allows for projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange where users can trade and stake tokens. Plans are underway for a future NFT platform and a governance system driven by its community. In the current market cycle, SHIB stands out due to its growing utility and active development. While the crypto market is known for its ups and downs, SHIB’s connection to Ethereum and its expanding applications make it a noteworthy contender among emerging cryptocurrencies. Conclusion While PEPE and SHIB are notable, XYZVerse stands out by uniting sports fans in a meme coin aiming for 20,000% growth through a unique, community-driven ecosystem.

Facing a key level, the trend is still looking bullish on the daily timeframe. The recent monthly drawdown caused a notable decrease in the market, but CRV managed to hold above the $0.69 level last week – providing a sizeable discount for the bulls. They took advantage of it and pushed the price back up with a strong close above the $0.8 level. Volatility enhanced this week and the price surged consistently until it tapped the key $1 level on Wednesday. This key level posed a threat to the bulls and the price dropped. Resurging from $0.89 yesterday, the price is once again facing resistance at the mentioned key level. But looking at the latest move, CRV appeared to be staging a new rally following the recent bounce back. A break above this level could fuel a bigger rally in the next few days, although the current monthly high is another major obstacle to overcome before the mega rally takes place. Failure to scale through could result in a drop capable of correcting the price lower before locating a solid level for a fresh increase. But from the look of things, the bulls are more likely to have an upper hand. CRV’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview The main resistance to watch for a major break-up is $1.3 – the current monthly high. From there, the $1.7 and $2 levels would be higher resistance levels for a test. The $0.88 level is considered close support, followed by the holding $0.69 level – standing as the monthly low. Losing these levels could trigger a broader correction to $577 and $0.47.

Elsewhere, the new MemeFi altcoin Yeti Ouro (YETIO) is aiming for $1 in 2025 as play-to-earn gaming continues to surge. Ethereum Price To Hit $4,000 And Solana Price To $1,000 In a bull rally where most altcoins have impressed, Ethereum price has failed to match up with its rivals including Solana, XRP, and Cardano, which have all surged in the November rally. Ether has dipped around 10% since December began, but according to analysts, it could hit $4,000 before the year ends. Despite the dip, Ether has remained bullish on the derivatives market, with traders still bullish that the top altcoin can break past $3,500 before pushing past $4,000. ETH contracts are currently trading at a neutral range, down from around 18% at the start of the month. Meanwhile, Solana has had a much better year than Ethereum. Solana price hit a new all-time high of $263.5 a month ago, but since then, has been on a decline, aligning with a broader dip in most asset prices, including the industry benchmark, gold. SOL recently broke out of a downward channel, which indicates it could be on course for a bullish reversal. The token found strong support at the 0.786 Fibonacci level and is now targeting $254.4 as the next target. After this, the next target is $345.8, with $1,000 as the ultimate target for SOL holders. Yeti Ouro Aims For $1 In 2025 Yeti Ouro, an Ethereum-based altcoin that merges the excitement of crypto with the adrenaline of gaming, continues to attract attention from crypto investors as it eyes $1 in 2025. Yeti Ouro recently completed the first stage of its sold out presale, selling 100 million tokens to raise $1.2 million. In the ongoing second stage, investors have snapped up over 15 million tokens, taking presale over the $1.46 million mark. Yeti Ouro is built around Yeti Go, a play-to-earn (P2E) game developed by avid gamers in partnership with a prestigious gaming company whose portfolio includes Spiderman, Call of Duty and other iconic titles. On Yeti Go, players compete in a thrilling racing track for the prize, which is rewarded in YETIO tokens. To win, the players must dodge hazards and obstacles and fight off attacks from fellow players. To gain an edge, they can attack their rivals with weapons purchased on the in-game marketplace with YETIO. The tokens can also be staked to unlock exclusive rewards or used to make payments on the in-game marketplace. Yeti Ouro has capped the total token supply to one billion YETIO, with 50% allocated to the presale and 5% to the token-burning mechanism, which reduces the supply and props up the price.

38272792,https://nulltx.com/?p=137192,1735491689,"DOGECOIN PRICE ANALYSIS & PREDICTION (December 29) – Doge Traps In Consolidation Amid Low Volatility, Potential Break?","The past week’s trading has been dicey as Doge failed to initiate a major move due to serious volatility drops across the market. It showed signs of strength in the past hours but remains trapped in consolidation. Since last week, Dogecoin has stayed well above the $0.3 level following a sharp rejection at $0.26, held as a monthly low. This brought a temporal halt in the correction with no sign of a major recovery. However, the recent volatility drop has subjected trading to a consolidation mode, indicating indecisiveness in the market. As seen on the daily chart, the leading meme coin is struggling with volatility and has yet to signal its next major move, although it is showing signs of strength on the daily chart. The consolidation, which led the market into a little-to-no movement since the start of this week might end soon if buying volume increases. While last week’s rejection suggests exhaustion in the correction, a breakdown could bring an extension until it finds a solid ground level. Nonetheless, it is important to note that the monthly correctional phase is still very much intact on the daily chart. A major move from the current trading level would determine where the price is headed next. DOGE’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Losing grip above $0.3, the price may roll back to the $0.262 support. A breakdown from there could send the price to a low of $0.22 and $0.18. Resuming bullish, Doge must retake the immediate $0.365 resistance along with the monthly $0.48 high. A break above this high could sprout a surge to $0.6 before reaching the key $1 level by the end of this bull run.

For buyers, it’s critical to understand these trends to spot the best long-term crypto options. Recently, the Avalanche price prediction anticipates it reaching $56 by the end of 2024. Meanwhile, the Fantom price is currently at a pivotal support range of $0.741–$0.7906. On another note, the advanced layer-1 blockchain, BlockDAG, has successfully raised $173.5 million in its active presale, aiming high. This milestone is supported by a robust community of over 170,000 active users, reflecting strong trust in this burgeoning project. This analysis aims to assess the future potential of Avalanche, Fantom, and BlockDAG as contenders for the best long-term crypto. Can Avalanche Hit $56 by Late 2024? Recent forecasts suggest Avalanche might reach $56.87 by late 2024. Predictions for 2025 see its price fluctuating between $66.22 and $84.78, averaging at $69.49. Looking forward to 2030, expectations climb, with forecasts ranging from $416.79 to $530.07, averaging at $512.69. AVAX faced significant volatility in 2024, experiencing a sharp decline after an early surge. Its ecosystem, known for robust decentralized application development, shows potential for growth. Despite this, Avalanche’s future price movement remains a subject of speculation. Fantom’s Market Position: Near a Turning Point? Fantom’s price is teetering near a crucial range between $0.741 and $0.79906, at a decisive moment. Staying above this level could push its price towards $1.10–$1.20, and possibly up to $2.00. Historically, this zone has triggered price rallies. However, falling below could see it drop to between $0.5237 and $0.5574. With a neutral RSI and subdued trading volumes, the market’s uncertainty persists, though the trendline supports a potentially positive trajectory.

38272791,https://nulltx.com/?p=137164,1735491614,BlockDAG Ignites Hollywood Buzz with Keynote 3 – Insights on Shiba Inu Technical Analysis & Stellar Prices,"The excitement around cryptocurrency is palpable as Shiba Inu’s technical analysis shows mixed signals in the meme coin’s price trends, and Stellar (XLM) price target predictions indicate potential for significant growth. As the anticipation for BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 in 2025 grows, the buzz within the community is undeniable. Rumored to be crafted by a Hollywood director, this keynote promises a visually stunning presentation of BlockDAG’s cutting-edge DAG technology. For those scouting for the best crypto coin to buy, BlockDAG (BDAG) remains at the forefront of the crypto sphere. This trio of developments—BlockDAG’s Hollywood-style keynote, the intrigue surrounding Shiba Inu’s market movements, and Stellar’s optimistic path—presents an enticing story for crypto followers and purchasers. Shiba Inu Technical Analysis: Turnaround or Further Downturn? Shiba Inu (SHIB) is at a crucial juncture, with its price dynamics showing signs of both a bullish recovery and bearish pressures. Over the last week, SHIB has experienced intense selling pressure, with its market cap dropping sharply by 20% from $15 billion to $12.5 billion. This decline has brought SHIB to vital support levels, leading to diverse interpretations of its immediate future. However, the Shiba Inu technical analysis also points to a notable rebound in the RSI, which surged from 16.9 to 44 in just three days, hinting at possible stabilization, although other indicators suggest caution. Is Stellar (XLM) Price Target Reachable? Currently priced at $0.3514, Stellar (XLM) is nearing a critical juncture in its price trajectory. Despite today’s 1.40% drop, the cryptocurrency is close to a crucial support level at $0.33. Experts believe this level is essential for price stability, with potential declines if it fails. Yet, a bounce back from this point could pave the way for Stellar to hit higher resistance levels at $0.37 and $0.50. The long-term Stellar (XLM) price target of $2 could be achievable if these support levels hold and market conditions favor an upswing. BlockDAG’s Star-Studded Keynote 3 Unites Hollywood and Blockchain BlockDAG is set to dazzle the crypto scene with its eagerly awaited Keynote 3, rumored to be directed by a famous Hollywood filmmaker. This fusion of cinematic artistry and blockchain technology is poised to captivate audiences and showcase BlockDAG’s modern edge. This event will highlight BlockDAG’s sophisticated Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology and its compatibility with Ethereum, positioning it as a leading topic among Layer 1 initiatives. For anyone looking for the best crypto coin to buy, BlockDAG’s distinctive strategy and burgeoning popularity are persuasive reasons to pay attention. Like its predecessors, Keynote 3 aims to boost the ongoing momentum of BlockDAG’s presale, which has already accumulated over $173.5 million and 17.6 billion BDAG coins acquired by enthusiastic supporters. Participants in the early stages have realized a staggering 2240% ROI, attracting both larger entities and individual participants eager to join this pioneering venture. The excitement surrounding Keynote 3 is set to escalate interest in BlockDAG, potentially accelerating its presale success. With Keynote 3 at the convergence of blockchain excellence and Hollywood flair, BlockDAG is reshaping perceptions of crypto ventures while affirming its status as a top contender for substantial returns. Final Say The crypto market is buzzing with excitement as BlockDAG, Shiba Inu, and Stellar (XLM) grab the limelight. Shiba Inu’s technical analysis indicates a mix of hurdles and growth opportunities, while optimistic signs suggest the $2 Stellar (XLM) price target is within sight. Yet, BlockDAG captures the spotlight, transforming the crypto market with a Hollywood-produced Keynote 3. Having raised over $173.5 million in its presale and delivering a 2240% ROI, BlockDAG is rapidly emerging as a trailblazer in blockchain innovation. As Keynote 3 blends high-caliber filmmaking with breakthrough tech, BlockDAG stakes its claim as the best crypto coin to buy for those seeking both novelty and potential.

Whether it’s BlockDAG’s scalability, Ethereum’s DeFi dominance, Avalanche’s speed, or XRP’s regulatory momentum, these assets offer compelling reasons to consider them for a strong 2025 portfolio. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): 2024 Success Sets the Stage for 2025’s Bull Run BlockDAG (BDAG) is redefining blockchain technology with a simplified yet powerful approach to scalability and efficiency. Its innovative Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure allows the network to process 10 blocks per second, targeting 100+ in the future. By enhancing mining efficiency and reducing block wastage, BlockDAG promises to deliver an equitable and decentralised ecosystem. In 2024, BlockDAG achieved several milestones, including raising $173.5M during its presale, launching an alpha testnet, and completing the foundational phase of its DAG-based blockchain. These achievements laid the groundwork for its highly anticipated 2025 mainnet launch, creating a surge of excitement among its 170K+ strong community. With plans including more DeFi tools, exchange listings, and advanced mining setups , the 2025 mainnet promises to unlock unparalleled opportunities and a huge coin value surge. The BDAG coin’s impressive 2240% price surge, rising from $0.001 to $0.0234, coupled with analysts projecting it to reach $1, highlights the growing confidence in BlockDAG’s potential. With the presale rapidly nearing its $600M cap, BlockDAG is solidifying its position as one of the best cryptos to join now for 2025’s bull run. 2. Ethereum (ETH): A Strong Bet for Growth as Demand Surges Ethereum (ETH) continues to stand out as one of the best cryptos to join now for 2025 bull run, with its current price at $3,337. Its transition to proof-of-stake and ongoing scalability improvements have solidified its position as the backbone of decentralised finance (DeFi). Recent whale activity, with $5.7 billion worth of ETH accumulated, and record-breaking inflows into Ethereum ETFs demonstrate growing confidence from both retail and institutional investors. Coupled with ETH burning mechanisms reducing supply, Ethereum is well-positioned for substantial growth as demand for its ecosystem increases. 3. Avalanche (AVAX): Speed & Scalability Fuel Its Potential With its current price at $36.57, Avalanche (AVAX) is gaining momentum as a leading blockchain platform for speed and scalability. Recent advancements, including the Avalanche9000 upgrade and significant partnerships, have strengthened its position in decentralised finance (DeFi). The platform’s ability to support high-speed transactions and tokenised assets highlights its growth potential. As adoption rises and institutional interest grows, Avalanche is positioned to shine in the upcoming 2025 bull run, making it a top pick among the best cryptos to join now for 2025 bull run. 4. XRP (XRP): Regulatory Clarity & Technological Growth XRP, Ripple Labs' flagship cryptocurrency, is making waves as one of the best cryptos to join now for 2025 bull run. Its recent 350% price surge to $2.89 reflects optimism about a more favorable regulatory landscape following the U.S. presidential election. The launch of RLUSD, a stablecoin approved by New York regulators, has further solidified XRP's utility in cross-border payments. With the possibility of the SEC lawsuit being dropped and increased institutional adoption on the horizon, XRP is positioned for significant growth as crypto markets head toward 2025. Which is the Best Crypto To Join Before 2025’s Bull Run? As the best cryptos to join now for 2025 bull run, these four projects each bring something exceptional to the table, but BlockDAG (BDAG) stands apart for its unmatched potential. With a 2240% price surge, $173.5M raised so far, and analysts projecting it could reach $1, BDAG offers a rare opportunity to join a growing ecosystem before its 2025 mainnet launch. Ethereum (ETH) leads in DeFi innovation, Avalanche (AVAX) excels in speed and scalability, and XRP (XRP) benefits from growing regulatory clarity. However, BlockDAG’s momentum and coin presale success make it the top pick for traders seeking maximum profits. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

38272692,https://nulltx.com/?p=137189,1735491457,FXGuys: The Top Whale Pick for December 2024,"As Litecoin Faces Resistance, This Altcoin Emerges as the Top Whale Pick for December 2024 As 2024 nears its end, Litecoin (LTC), once a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency market, is grappling with significant resistance levels. While Litecoin has long been a favourite among traders, its recent performance has left investors seeking alternative options with better growth potential. Enter FXGuys , a rising star in the DeFi space that has captured the attention of whales and crypto analysts alike. This article explores why FXGuys, powered by its $FXG token, is emerging as the best DeFi token and how its innovative features like Trade2Earn, staking, and the Trader Funding Program are positioning it as the Top PropFi Project for December 2024. Litecoin’s Struggles Open Doors for New Contenders Litecoin has long been known for its speed and affordability compared to Bitcoin, but its recent inability to break past critical resistance levels has frustrated traders. Many whales—large-scale investors known for their influence on the market—are now shifting focus to promising altcoins that offer greater utility and growth potential. This market shift creates an opportunity for emerging projects like FXGuys to step into the spotlight. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE FXGuys: A Whale Magnet in the Making 1.

This decentralized model aligns with the crypto community’s ethos of anonymity and freedom, making FXGuys a top choice for privacy-focused investors. 3. Staking Opportunities for Passive Income Beyond trading, FXGuys appeals to passive investors through its lucrative staking options. Users can earn consistent rewards by holding and staking $FXG tokens, making it an ideal investment for short-term and long-term strategies.

What’s Next for FXGuys in 2024? 1. Enhanced Platform Features FXGuys plans to roll out advanced trading tools and cross-chain compatibility, further solidifying its position as a Top PropFi Project. 2. Strategic Partnerships Collaborations with other DeFi platforms and blockchain projects will enhance FXGuys’ visibility and adoption. 3.

38272862,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634529,1735491453,Two major AI chip giants prepare for the worse ahead of Trump’s tariffs,"Nvidia and AMD are strategizing ahead of Trump’s tariffs against trade partners, including China, Mexico, and Canada, pushing America toward a trade war. According to a recent report by The Street, Nvidia and AMD are speeding up the launch of their new GPUs, hoping to get them out in time for President Trump’s inauguration on January 20th. The aim is to spare the higher costs that could stem from a 60% tariff on Chinese imports. In turn, the production expenses and consumer prices of GPUs would go up significantly. Trump will officially announce his plans in a few weeks. However, his plans have already begun impacting how American tech does business. Tech companies are trying to hedge their risk from heavy tariffs promised on trade partners such as China, Canada, and Mexico. In his first term, Trump’s tariffs engendered a trade war, and companies are no longer looking to see if history will repeat itself. Nvidia and AMD are particularly vulnerable, relying on Chinese firms for chip assembly and testing. Tech blog Wccftech and a Chinese news site confirm that partners are ramping up production of add-in boards for Nvidia and AMD. They hope such acceleration will lock in profits before tariffs make GPUs even pricier. Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 may go from $1,799 to $2,500, impacting Silicon Valley’s AI boom These GPUs are key to the AI revolution, a sector already under pressure because of potential supply chain constraints. Nvidia’s flagship GPUs, which aren’t cheap to begin with, will become even more expensive due to anticipated tariffs. According to Wccftech, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 may go from $1,799 to $2,500. Price hikes like this could radically alter the GPU market, increasing second-hand GPU demand and potentially opening the door for rivals. Leading tech companies like Google and Amazon are also exploring in-house AI chips to reduce reliance on Nvidia and AMD. AI and the tech industry are preparing for the worst Nvidia and AMD aren’t the only ones preparing for the worst . Dell and HP have also urged suppliers to step up production. Microsoft is also following the same strategy. Meanwhile, China suggests it may retaliate by scrutinizing U.S. tech firms. The looming tariffs could disrupt supply chains, increase costs, and change Silicon Valley’s AI boom. Nvidia and AMD’s strategic pivot is just one of many moves by tech giants to prepare for what could be a bumpy economic turn.

Currently priced at $0.0011 during its fifth presale phase, DOGEN is poised to appreciate 18% to $0.0013 as it transitions to Stage 6. By the end of the presale, the token is projected to deliver an impressive 600% gain compared to its initial price, offering early investors a substantial upside.

With a roadmap designed for sustainability and innovation, DOGEN integrates a variety of community rewards and utility-driven features. These include airdrop rewards, staking options for passive income, and a multi-level referral program that incentivizes network expansion. Further bolstering its appeal is the upcoming DogeTap app, which will enhance DOGEN’s functionality and utility, transitioning it from a simple meme coin to a practical and versatile asset within the Solana ecosystem. Why DOGEN deserves a spot If DOGEN maintains its current momentum and executes on its strategic milestones, it has the potential to become a cornerstone of the Solana network. The combination of projected 600% presale gains, community-oriented initiatives, and unique utility-driven applications makes DOGEN a strong candidate for sustained growth. Whether someone is an investor looking for rapid gains or long-term stability, DOGEN is shaping up to be one of the most promising opportunities in the crypto market. Solana’s SOL: The ultimate high-speed blockchain for decentralized applications Solana has established itself as one of the fastest and most scalable blockchain platforms, offering a powerful foundation for decentralized applications and standing tall alongside major players like Ethereum and Cardano. Built with cutting-edge architecture, Solana enables lightning-fast transactions and flexible development across multiple programming languages, making it a favorite for developers and innovators alike. At the heart of this ecosystem lies SOL, Solana’s native cryptocurrency, which serves as the backbone of the network. SOL powers transactions, supports the execution of custom programs, and rewards participants for maintaining the network’s operations. This utility makes SOL an essential asset for accessing Solana’s expansive suite of decentralized projects. Ethereum: A leading proof-of-stake blockchain with growing potential Ethereum is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain known for smart contracts and a wide range of decentralized applications. It supports decentralized finance and uses Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon to improve transaction efficiency. Ethereum introduced ERC-20 tokens, which are used across various applications, but transactions still require ETH for gas fees. Since its launch in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum has evolved, transitioning to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge in 2022. The upcoming sharding phase aims to enhance scalability and reduce costs. Ether (ETH) remains central, facilitating transactions and rewarding stakers. Based on historical price movements and BTC halving cycles, Ethereum’s price predictions suggest potential growth. These developments may make Ethereum attractive in the current market cycle. Bitcoin: The pioneer cryptocurrency and its potential today Bitcoin (BTC) is the first cryptocurrency, introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto to enable electronic cash transactions without central authorities. It operates on blockchain technology, a distributed ledger across network nodes, removing intermediaries like banks. Transactions are verified through mining, where miners solve complex puzzles to validate them and earn bitcoins. The supply is capped at 21 million bitcoins. Every four years, a “halving” reduces miners’ rewards by half, affecting mining profitability. Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and limited supply contribute to its potential. In the current market cycle, Bitcoin continues to attract interest as a digital asset with unique features. Dogecoin: From meme to major cryptocurrency Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency that began in 2013 as a light-hearted alternative to traditional coins, featuring a Shiba Inu dog as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a capped supply, Dogecoin has no maximum limit, and 10,000 new coins are mined every minute. In 2021, its value soared, boosted by social media and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk, making it one of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The coin’s abundant supply and active community have made it popular for small transactions and tipping online. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin continues to draw interest due to its strong community support and high visibility in the crypto space. Conclusion While established coins like SOL, ETH, BTC, and DOGE may see limited short-term growth, DOGEN stands out for those seeking luxury and success. With expected 700% growth by the end of presale and potential for massive returns, DOGEN is building a community of leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

With these additions, the program now boasts 15 participating credit organizations. Revolutionizing Currency: The Digital Ruble Emerges The digital ruble marks a new era for Russian currency. This new currency initiative would function as a third form of the national currency, complementing physical cash and traditional non-cash money. This innovative system first began its pilot phase in August 2023, featuring 12 credit organizations. The program has expanded to include major players like VTB, Alfa-Bank, and Gazprombank, alongside Sberbank and others. This broad participation signals growing confidence in the initiative. By July 2025, the central bank expects all major banks to integrate digital ruble functionalities into their offerings. Customers can open digital ruble accounts, conduct transfers, and incorporate digital currency into their transactions. Smaller banks will follow this lead, ensuring nationwide coverage in the years ahead. Navigating Challenges on the Road to 2025 The journey toward full implementation is not without hurdles. To date, 22 banks have signed agreements with the CBR and are upgrading their systems to meet the program’s rigorous requirements. The central bank has emphasized compliance, warning financial institutions failing to meet the July 2025 deadline will face penalties. This directive highlights the central bank’s commitment to ensuring a seamless and timely rollout of the digital ruble. The pilot program’s early testing has already shown promising results. From its initial phas,e with 600 participants, the program expanded to 9,000 participants by October 2024. This rapid growth reflects the program’s scalability and readiness to accommodate widespread adoption, laying a solid foundation for its rollout. The Broader Vision: Equal Access for All The CBR’s ultimate goal is inclusivity by making the CBDC as accessible as cash and non-cash options. The central bank aims to create a seamless financial experience for individuals and businesses. This equitable approach fosters trust and ensures that digital currency becomes a cornerstone of everyday transactions. As the digital ruble pilot progresses, it positions Russia as a pioneer in the global race to adopt Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC). With Sberbank and other major players on board, Russia’s digital ruble initiative is poised to redefine the future of money.

Delegate Representatives were also launched, enabling token holders to delegate the voting powers. The second phase, scheduled for 2025 under CIP-1694, will complete the governance system.

However, the meme coin appears to have stabilized just above the $0.3 mark. Interestingly, this price level might only serve as a springboard for the price of Dogecoin to new highs, according to a prominent crypto analyst on the social media platform X. The expert believes that the value of the meme coin could skyrocket to as high as $23. Is DOGE Price Gearing For A 7,500% Rally? In a new post on the X platform, crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that the Dogecoin price might be primed for a bullish breakout. This projection is based on the return of a price pattern (fractals) in the DOGE weekly chart, with the pundit suggesting that the token could rally to a new all-time high of $23. Related Reading: Galaxy Research Reveals Bitcoin, Ether And Dogecoin Price Projections In 2025 Crypto Forecast For clarity, fractals are repeating patterns in price charts that can help predict future price movements for a particular cryptocurrency. As shown in the chart below, the Dogecoin price has been in a recurring descending triangle pattern on the weekly timeframe since as far back as 2014. This bullish fractal has occurred multiple times in the past, with the Dogecoin price embarking on a positive run after breaking out of the consolidation range. Martinez highlighted that the price of DOGE broke out of the fractal in 2017, reaching a then-all-time high of $0.01877. Similarly, the Dogecoin price broke out of the descending triangle in 2021, skyrocketing to the current all-time high of $0.7 during the previous bull cycle. Most recently, the meme coin has just broken out of this historical fractal. With the current setup on the weekly chart, the price of DOGE looks set for a bullish explosion in the coming year. According to Martinez, the largest meme coin could travel as high as the $23 mark over the next few months, representing a 7,500% rally from the current price point. Dogecoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of DOGE sits just above the $0.32 mark, reflecting a 2.5% increase in the past day. Nevertheless, this positive single-day performance has not been enough to move the meme coin into profit on the weekly timeframe.

38271524,https://nulltx.com/?p=137040,1735488969,BNB Price Prediction: Can Binance Coin Hit $1K while JetBolt Enters the Scene,"The final week of the year’s crypto news highlights major developments surrounding Binance Coin (BNB) and the next-gen altcoin, JetBolt (JBOLT). BNB experienced a modest 3% uptick over the past week, partially driven by its recent listing on the Revolut platform. Could the potential increased adoption stemming from BNB’s recent listing on the platform be the boost it needs to reach a massive $1,000 price surge? On the other hand, the young altcoin JetBolt, with its zero-gas-tech feature, electrifies the crypto scene with a blazing entrance—selling over 200 million tokens since its presale began. Can JetBolt continue its current momentum until the new year? Let’s find out the answers in this article as we assess JetBolt and BNB. BNB Price Forecast: Is $1,000 Within Reach for Binance Coin? Binance Coin (BNB) registered a slight gain of 3% over the past week, coinciding with the coin’s recent listing on Revolut, a crypto trading platform with over 40 million global users. With the platform’s extensive user base and the potential for increased adoption, is BNB close to a $1,000 price surge? Not quite yet. BNB’s weekly price chart on the CoinMarketCap website shows its price traded below the $700 mark in the final week of December 2024 As of this writing, BNB is trading at approximately $694. Despite Revolut adding BNB to its list of crypto trading options, Binance’s utility token is still on a downtrend. While BNB’s price chart shows moderate activity, there have been no dramatic shifts, and the coin has been noticeably struggling to maintain a stronghold above the critical $700 level. According to the latest technical analysis from NewsBTC published on TradingView, BNB must break through the $705 resistance and push past the $735 mark before a major move, like a potential $1,000 price jump, can take shape. JetBolt Presale Soars with 200M JBOLT Tokens Sold, Here’s Why While BNB’s journey to the $1,000 mark stalls, JetBolt’s (JBOLT) rising stardom caught the attention of large buyers seeking hot next-gen altcoins. A new altcoin in its presale phase, JetBolt’s milestone of selling over 200 million tokens reflects the growing enthusiasm and interest of large buyers. The narrative behind JetBolt’s fiery presale performance highlights its impressive and game-changing features. Zero-gas technology is one of JetBolt’s most remarkable features. This high-tech feature enables crypto users to carry out transactions without paying the usual hefty gas fees. Moreover, JetBolt simplifies staking, making it both effortless and enjoyable. Stakers can unlock bonus rewards by connecting with friends on the platform, fostering a more interactive and rewarding crypto-staking experience. Additionally, JetBolt’s artificial intelligence-driven crypto insights tool might pique the interest of crypto natives who want the convenience of knowing the latest blockchain market trends and exploring the top trending coins. As JetBolt’s presale is in full swing, this young token is turning up the excitement with exclusive perks for early adopters. Buyers can snag up to 25% extra tokens when purchasing Alpha Boxes or JetBolt (JBOLT) tokens in batches, adding a layer of irresistible appeal to this already electrifying event. Key Takeaways — BNB Races Toward $1,000 as JetBolt Presale Skyrockets BNB may have been flashing green in the charts over the past few days. However, its $1,000 price target seems out of reach yet, as BNB hasn’t gone up to the resistance level at $705. On the other hand, JetBolt’s blazing presale phase, coupled with its intriguing and revolutionary features like zero-gas technology, helps cement its status as one of the best new altcoins to watch in 2025.

38271678,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53381,1735488019,"Trader Who Called Shiba Inu’s Life-Changing Rally Resurfaces with a 24050% Prediction, But Not for SHIB","The trader who predicted the surge of Shiba Inu in the 2021 bull run has resurfaced again with an explosive altcoin that will perform as Shiba Inu did in the last bull run and even overtake Shiba Inu in terms of market cap. The token is Rexas Finance(RXS), which has been making waves with its presale stages completed before their schedule and its innovative model of real-world assets (RWAs) tokenization. The trader predicts that RXS will surge to a whopping 24050% within a few weeks after the newly elected president of the US, Donald Trump, gets sworn in. Currently, in stage 10 of its presale, where one RXS goes for 0.150, and this stage is almost selling out, and the next stage is priced at $0.175. Rexas Finance Presale Surges: A Gateway to Double-Digit Growth by 2025 Rexas Finance launched in September 2024 and has rapidly turned into a radical development in asset tokenization. This platform looks to democratize access to high-value investments (by tokenizing real-world assets like real estate, commodities, fine art, etc). While lowering entry barriers, this approach also increases transparency and liquidity in asset trading. It is a transformative concept of tokenizing real-world assets. By applying blockchain tech, Rexas Finance allows investors to purchase fractional ownership of valuable assets. The presale of Rexas Finance has been simply phenomenal. Currently, RXS tokens are at $0.150 at the beginning of stage 10, and the next level is at $0.175. The presale has raised over $31 million of the $33 million mark, with over 372 380 million total tokens sold. An enormous demand results from an upsurge in investor confidence in the project, thus expecting heavy returns. https://twitter.com/rexasfinance/status/1870473818646671546 The success of the presale shows that RXS is still on investors’ radar as an opportunity for investment. As an early investor, projections suggest that the token could grow to double digits by early 2025. This project bolsters such predictions by offering innovative features and firmly believing in integrating traditional finance with blockchain. Rexas Finance: A Bold 24,050% Growth Prediction Backed by Market Visionaries Rexas Finance’s recent prediction is also being touted by the trader who correctly predicted Shiba Inu’s explosive ascent. Now, this trader has aimed RXS towards a 24,050% increase in value. Although such predictions can be taken with a grain of salt, they show the potential many see in Rexas Finance as it bounced on the crypto market. This prediction is consistent with the surge in cryptocurrencies focused on real-world applications and asset-backed tokens. Projects like Rexas Finance will also empower more investors wishing to explore beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum as they seek a more transformative investment option in the digital asset space. Conclusion Rexas Finance is a shift in how we think of and engage with investments linked to real-world assets. Its approach to tokenization is unique, while its presale performance is impressive, making it a top-notch opportunity for seasoned and new investors. The bold prediction of a 24,050% increase seems an easy reach based on the project’s momentum.

38271677,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53388,1735487676,"Whale Insider: XRP Is Gearing Up for Mega Pump, 100x-1000x Gains Are Coming","XRP has recently shown why it is one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies in the market. The digital asset outperformed most major cryptocurrencies with a surge of almost 300% in November, crossing $2 for the first time since 2018 and hitting a multi-year high of $2.86. This resurgence has sparked optimism among investors and enthusiasts about XRP’s future, with market trends and regulatory developments fueling this optimism. Whale Insider, a well-known crypto commentator, recently emphasized the potential of XRP in a post on X. According to the analyst (@WhaleInsider), XRP is gearing up for a mega pump. He also drew attention to meme coins on its blockchain. The increasing activity on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and broader market trends support the view that the ecosystem is undergoing significant expansion. Whale Insider predicts a 100x to 1,000x increase for the digital asset. The Rise of Meme Coins on XRP A notable trend in the XRP ecosystem is the influx of meme coins on the XRPL. These tokens have drawn attention to the blockchain, and as more projects adopt the XRPL for token creation, its overall utility and visibility have increased. This growing interest in meme coins could lead to greater adoption and liquidity for XRP, potentially benefiting its valuation and market standing. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Regulatory Developments That Could Push the Asset Another key factor influencing XRP’s trajectory is the evolving regulatory landscape in the U.S. The announcement that Gary Gensler, the current Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), will resign on January 20, 2025, marks a turning point for the crypto industry. President-elect Donald Trump’s nomination of Paul Atkins, a crypto-friendly nominee, as Gensler’s successor has raised hopes of a more favorable regulatory environment for digital assets. The ongoing SEC lawsuit against Ripple has been a significant obstacle for XRP. A shift in leadership at the SEC, coupled with speculation that the new administration might end the Ripple lawsuit and other similar cases, has led to increased optimism in the market. Many believe this could remove a major barrier to XRP’s growth, enabling the asset to regain its position as a leading cryptocurrency. Can XRP Rise By 100x Or 1,000x XRP is currently trading at $2.19, and a 100x surge would send the asset to $219, breaking into triple-digit territory. A 1,000x surge would put XRP at an astonishing $2,190, a price most assets can only dream of. XRP is in a good position to capitalize on the current bull cycle, and it will be intriguing to watch its trajectory over the next few months.

Prince Elon (ELONPRIN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONPRIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Prince Elon can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Prince Elon could become the next viral memecoin. Prince Elon launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Prince Elon on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Prince Elon by entering its contract address – 7rAsmWGTtPFY9RFnhd9biard7PrWtw5ZigowwfmaXUQ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONPRIN.

38270766,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99492,1735487044,“XRP Trading Is on Fire” Asserts Billion-Dollar Crypto Brokerage Firm’s Executive,"XRP continued its sluggish trading trend as the weekend approached, dampening hopes of a Santa Claus rally this December amid a broader crypto market pullback led by Bitcoin. However, it’s worth noting that the crypto asset experienced a historic surge last month, skyrocketing over 470% in November and reaching $2.89, a level not seen in nearly seven years. This price spike followed two major developments including Donald Trump’s re-election victory and renewed optimism stemming from Ripple’s significant legal win against the SEC in its long-standing securities lawsuit over XRP. Market participants are also hopeful for more crypto-friendly regulations under the Trump administration, further fueling XRP’s momentum . That said, the ripple effects of these positive developments extend beyond market sentiment, manifesting in a surge of institutional participation within the XRP ecosystem. FalconX, a billion-dollar crypto prime brokerage, has reported an extraordinary increase in XRP trading volume. Austin Reid, FalconX’s Global Head of Revenue and Business, highlighted this momentum in a recent tweet, stating, “XRP trading is on fire. We’ve seen 10x growth in volume at FalconX between the first and second halves of Q4. This isn’t just retail action—institutions are driving the momentum.” Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse amplified the excitement by retweeting Reid’s statement, further fueling interest and engagement within the XRP community. Notably, Reid’s assertion highlights a significant shift in the cryptocurrency market, particularly the increasing participation of institutional investors in XRP trading. Traditionally regarded as a utility-driven digital asset, particularly for facilitating cross-border payments, a vision championed by Ripple, XRP is now garnering broader recognition. Ripple’s recent advancements, including the launch of the RLUSD stablecoin earlier this month, are poised to significantly bolster its ecosystem. Notably, through RLUSD Ripple Payments, which has already facilitated over $70 billion in payment volume and boasts near-global coverage across over 90 payout markets, stands to see substantial growth. FalconX’s revelation of a tenfold increase in XRP trading volumes during Q4 this year underscores a significant transition in market dynamics. In the first week of this month, XRP, now the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, achieved a groundbreaking milestone with its trading volume surpassing the combined trading volume of Ethereum and Bitcoin, for the first time ever. Additionally, by partnering with banks and payment systems worldwide, Ripple has showcased XRP’s potential as a transformative solution for international settlements. Adding to the momentum speculation surrounding the possibility of a spot XRP ETF and Ripple’s rumored IPO following a favorable resolution of its legal battles with the SEC have further bolstered market sentiment. These developments are drawing institutional attention, as XRP is increasingly seen as more than just a speculative asset, but a cornerstone for real-world applications in global finance. At press time, XRP was trading at $2.16 reflecting a 0.90% drop over the past 24 hours.",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/xrp-trading-is-on-fire-asserts-billion-dollar-crypto-brokerage-firms-executive/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png
38270452,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=106043,1735486793,Here’s XRP Price if It Reclaims Its Ratio of Bitcoin Market Cap Before SEC Lawsuit,"XRP price has the potential to reach a two-digit figure if XRP recaptures the percentage of Bitcoin market cap it held in 2018 before the SEC lawsuit. Amid a broader market pullback from the Federal Reserve's hawkish stance on the economy, XRP has suffered a huge blow. The altcoin's price collapsed from a top of $2.72 on Dec. 17 to a floor of $1.96 on Dec. 20, marking a massive 28% decline within four days.XRP recovered from the $1.96 low as a result of the robust support at this level, a region that previously acted as resistance. Despite the rebound, XRP price is still 25% down from the $2.72 peak, currently hovering around $2.16 at press time. XRP Price Underperforms While Bitcoin ThrivesAt this price, XRP's market cap stands at $132 billion, according to data from TradingView. It bears mentioning that XRP hit an all-time high market valuation of $165 billion on Dec. 3, when its price soared to the seven-year high of $2.9. Before now, the peak valuation stood at $128.5 billion in January 2018.However, despite this cycle's valuation being greater than the 2017/2018 valuation, it captures a much lower chunk of Bitcoin's market cap. For context, in January 2018, when XRP's market cap hit $128.5 billion, Bitcoin had a valuation of $260.05 billion. This indicates that XRP captured 49.4% of BTC's market cap at the time.This ratio continued to decline considerably as XRP price faced turbulence over the years, while Bitcoin thrived. Further, the SEC lawsuit, which began in December 2020, exacerbated XRP's underperformance, resulting in the asset missing out on the 2020/2021 bull run. Amid this sustained underperformance , the ratio of XRP's market cap to Bitcoin's valuation has plummeted considerably. For instance, at the start of this year, on Jan. 1, XRP only had 3.9% of Bitcoin's market cap. Notably, at the time, XRP's valuation stood at $33 billion, while Bitcoin had a market cap of $838 billion.What if XRP Reclaimed Ratio of BTC Market Cap?Interestingly, following the November rally, XRP's market cap has skyrocketed to new heights. Now, with a market valuation of $132 billion, XRP captures about 6.8% of Bitcoin's market cap, which now sits at $1.93 trillion. This is still way below the 49.4% ratio from 2018.Nonetheless, market experts believe XRP price will only surge further from here, especially after the ongoing correction ends. If XRP reclaimed the 49.4% Bitcoin market cap ratio, the implications would be massive for prices.For context, 49.4% of the current Bitcoin valuation is $953 billion. Should XRP reach a market cap of $953 billion, its price would skyrocket to $16.6, considering the circulating supply of 57.25 billion tokens. Such a price would mark a 621% increase from the current XRP price. Interestingly, market expert EGRAG had previously projected this price target for XRP. In October, EGRAG leveraged a Linear Regression principle to set three XRP price targets, including $16.",NEGATIVE,BTC | XRP,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/29/heres-xrp-price-if-it-reclaims-its-ratio-of-bitcoin-market-cap-before-sec-lawsuit/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heres-xrp-price-if-it-reclaims-its-ratio-of-bitcoin-market-cap-before-sec-lawsuit,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

While most altcoins are currently navigating volatile tides, only a few top altcoins like Sui (SUI) and Tron (TRX) are able to register some decent profit in the broader crypto market. Notably, Sui token has attracted a lot of attention after delivering over 600% gain in the past few weeks. However, as the bull run appears to be stalling, savvy investors are beginning to look in another direction. In the presale market, for instance, Lunex Network (LNEX) is drawing enormous attention, having delivered roughly 300% in presale gain. Lunex Network’s 300% Price Surge Attracts Growing Interest; Can It Go Any Further? Beyond the rapid presale progression which have drawn a significant number of users to the network, Lunex Network (LNEX) also stands out for its innovative approach to decentralized finance (DeFi). Essentially, this DeFi protocol streamlines the processes involved in cross-chain crypto transactions, allowing users to instantly spot trade over 50,000 crypto assets across multiple isolated blockchains, all at a low cost and completely anonymously. Lunex Network particularly eliminated the need for users to provide sensitive data or connect third-party Defi wallets such as MetaMask and Trust Wallet. Asides fostering a secure trading environment for users, it also establishes the platform’s commitment to full transparency. Meanwhile, Lunex Network also offers a non-custodial B2B payment gateway that allows businesses to accept cryptocurrencies as a form of payment method. This institutional-focus, coupled with other notable features like its unique revenue share model, instant access to 65+ RPC nodes for Web3 development, a portfolio tracker and other subscription-based advance features positions Lunex network as a market disruptor. This explains how it is able to raise over $5.5 million in revenue within a short period, coupled with a 300% price pump from an initial price of $0.0012 to $0.0049. Sui Price Trajectory Presents Mores Profit Potential- Analyst Sui (SUI) network has continued to witness an influx of new investors since the start of its parabolic run earlier in September. Having surged by over 600% from 0.70 region to reach a yearly peak price and all-time high of $4.93, SUI token has established itself as a profitable altcoin. However, following a noticeable drop in bullish momentum across the crypto market, SUI price trajectory has been subjected to a major fluctuation as it struggles to stay above the crucial resistance level around $4.50. Currently trading within a weekly range of $3.70 and $4.39, SUI price reflects about 18% gain in the past week and nearly 29% in the past month. Although it has managed to maintain a generally bullish outlook, the recent volatility in the market casts a shadow of doubt on SUI token’s potential to cross the $5 price market anytime soon. Regardless, market analysts remain optimistic about a potential price breakout. Popular crypto analyst Mags particularly forecast a not-so-conservative price target between $14 and $19, thereby steering optimism among token holders. Tron Loses Steam Amid Market Correction, But Retains Bullish Sentiment Following the same path as Sui, the Tron (TRX) token has equally made an impressive run in the past few weeks. Notably, Tron price reached a yearly peak of $0.44 which also doubles as its ATH price. However, unlike SUI token, TRX price has suffered a more fatal impact as a result of recent volatility, declining by almost half of its peak price to currently trade within a weekly price range of $0.23 and $0.26. While this noticeable retracement is considered a minor setback, many analysts believe it is an essential correction to continue on the uptrend. According to a recent X post by Andrew Griffiths, TRX coin seems to be going for a breakout. Based on his chart analysis, TRX price could soon see up to 17% markup price growth if it is able to break out of the resistance zone around $0.30. Meanwhile, Tron technical analysis on TradingView, including 30, 50, and 200-day EMAs reflects a strong buy signal. Can Lunex Network Outpace SUI and Tron In Terms of Market Dominance? Both Sui and Tron have established themselves as formidable forces in the DeFi market, and it will take more than a strong presale performance from Lunex network to lead these innovative players. Regardless, Lunex Network’s multidimensional focus on retail and institutional players offers a major leverage. As it continues to attract more participants from both the crypto market and corporate world, Lunex Network stands a chance to tuple top altcoins like SUI and TRX tokens.

38270223,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=314502,1735486211,"Here’s Where Bitcoin and Solana Will Peak in Current Market Cycle, According to InvestAnswers","A closely followed crypto analyst is predicting where the price of Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Solana ( SOL ) will peak during the current market cycle. In a new video update, the host of InvestAnswers tells his 552,000 YouTube subscribers that he’s expecting the top crypto asset by market cap to soar by at least 43% from current levels before the bull market expires. “I’ve upped my Bitcoin price target to $136,000 from $120,000 with a super bull target of $154,000… Bitcoin is a peculiar animal – it’s all based on demand and supply. If the demand continues as it does, yes, these targets are very easily achievable, which is hard to believe. If you [were to] ask me this in 2023, I’d say ‘Whoa that’s bullish.’ Also, I do believe the spot ETFs (exchange-traded funds) will continue to add at least another $48 billion in 2025. That’s how much they added in 2024.” According to the analyst, the crypto king should peak sometime in Q3 or Q4 next year, based on historical patterns. “In 2015-2017, we peaked 518 days after the halving and in 2019 to 2021, we peaked 546 days after the halving, so taking an average of these, it’ll take us somewhere to [the] August to October time frame.” Bitcoin is trading for $94,882 at time of writing, a fractional increase during the last 24 hours. Moving on to Ethereum ( ETH ) rival Solana, the crypto strategist unveils his conservative and bullish targets for the layer-1 protocol. “I’ve got two targets [for Solana] just like I do with Bitcoin. I’ve got my conservative sandbag target at $332 and my bull target at $361. Could it go to $500? Yes, it could very easily, especially with ETFs and all the adoption that’s happening. All it takes is for somebody to really understand fundamental analysis and they’ll see that this chain is darn cheap.” Solana is trading for $193.42 at time of writing, a 5.18% gain during the last 24 hours.

38271675,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53376,1735486166,Expert States Two Reasons Why It’s Time For XRP to Shine,"A recent market analysis from IBM blockchain award recipient and Benzinga crypto advisory board member Armando Pantoja suggests XRP is positioned for significant price appreciation, despite current market skepticism. Pantoja’s assessment comes at a crucial time when XRP has experienced a period of price consolidation following its substantial gain of almost 300% in November. Market sentiment has grown increasingly uncertain as trading activity on major exchanges indicates rising selling pressure. Stop doubting $XRP : XRP shocked the world in 2017, rising from $0.003 to $3.31 something critics said could ""never happen"". It surged 110,000%, turning $1,000 into $1.1 million in just 1 year. Now the lawsuits soon over + Trump is coming. It's time to shine #XRP pic.twitter.com/gXxtnG8nGJ — Armando Pantoja (@_TallGuyTycoon) December 28, 2024 Data from CryptoQuant reveals an uptick in XRP holdings on Binance, with reserves increasing from 2.79 billion to 2.93 billion tokens between December 16 and today. This accumulation typically signals preparation for potential sales. The cryptocurrency’s current valuation stands at $2.19, representing an increase of approximately 15% from its price of $1.9 at the start of December, outperforming many other major digital assets that spent this period consolidating or falling. However, this modest growth follows a period of exceptional performance, leading some investors to question whether the asset’s upward momentum has been depleted. XRP’s History Shows Its Potential Historical precedent forms a cornerstone of Pantoja’s optimistic outlook. Pantoja noted that during the 2017-2018 bull market cycle, XRP demonstrated remarkable price action, appreciating from $0.003 to an all-time high of $3.31. This extraordinary surge represents an increase of over 110,000%. Pantoja also highlighted the transformative power of this surge, drawing attention to how a modest $1,000 investment turned into holdings worth approximately $1.1 million in under a year. Many other analysts believe XRP can repeat this performance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Factors That Could Push XRP to New Heights Several key catalysts could drive XRP’s next growth phase. However, Pantoja highlighted two crucial factors: 1) Donald Trump taking office as U.S. president in 2025. 2) the anticipated resolution of the legal battle between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple. With new SEC leadership expected to assume office in January 2025, the crypto world expects an end to the protracted lawsuit. This leadership transition could bring regulatory clarity to the XRP market, which could boost the value of the digital asset. This positive outlook negates earlier market skepticism, including concerns voiced by prominent figures such as Raoul Pal, who previously cautioned investors to avoid XRP so they don’t miss out on opportunities in other assets. However, with the bullish sentiment surrounding XRP and recent performance, sceptics may stop doubting its potential.

38269851,https://nulltx.com/?p=137143,1735485349,BTFD Coin’s 50% Bonus: Your Second Chance After Missing Neiro’s ICO Success,"So, you’ve heard the stories about Neiro’s ICO, right? Investors who got in early on this blockchain project are now sitting pretty as the coin rises and gains traction in the market. At launch, it was priced at mere fractions of a dollar, and since then, it’s been on an upward trajectory, attracting the attention of the crypto world. But if you missed that opportunity, don’t stress. There’s a new chance for you to grab a piece of the action— this time with BTFD Coin , which is offering a festive 50% bonus during its Stage 7 Price Rollback! All you have to do is use the BIG50 code when participating in the BTFD Coin presale today, and get 50% more coins in your wallet. This move is reminiscent of the savvy moves made during the 1973 oil crisis—investors swooped in when the market hit rock bottom, only to watch their investments soar. Now, you can take a leaf out of their book and secure a sweet deal with BTFD Coin. The Missed Neiro ICO: Some Main Insights Adopted by the same woman who once owned Kabosu (the iconic dog behind the Doge meme), Neiro carries forward the true spirit of meme coins and internet culture. What started as a tragic tale of abandonment, with Neiro being sent to a stray dog shelter after being rugged by the original developers, has blossomed into a community-powered success story. The coin’s comeback story caught the attention of Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin, who interacted with Neiro’s community in an unprecedented way. On August 4th, 2024, at exactly 11:59:59pm UTC, during the precise moment of the New Moon, Vitalik acknowledged Neiro’s unique place in the meme coin world. A few days later, in response to an X (formerly Twitter) post run by the Neiro community, Vitalik confirmed that he had made a generous donation of over $500k to an animal welfare fund, marking the second time ever that he’s engaged with a meme coin (the first being his support for SHIB back in 2021). Today, Neiro is 100% community-owned and managed, a true testament to the power of decentralisation and collective action. This isn’t just another meme token—it’s a movement. And with a strong commitment to giving back, Neiro has already made a donation to the shelter that once cared for its namesake, with more charitable initiatives lined up for the future. Neiro’s journey mirrors that of many investors: it’s a story of redemption, survival, and growth. While Neiro’s ICO raised millions and sparked significant interest, if you missed your chance to get in on the action during the presale, there’s no need to worry. BTFD Coin offers a fresh opportunity to seize the moment with an exciting presale discount, and it’s one you won’t want to miss! BTFD Coin: A 50% Bonus You Won’t Want to Miss While you may have missed Neiro’s ICO, now’s the perfect time to consider BTFD Coin—especially with its Stage 7 Price Rollback. This isn’t just a random discount, it’s a strategic move that could pay off big time. The Stage 7 rollback offers investors a chance to buy at 50% more coins—meaning you can get $BTFD tokens at a steal with the BIG50 bonus code. Just like savvy investors who saw the opportunities during the 1973 oil crisis, you have the chance to buy the dip and watch your investment grow. Back then, when the oil market collapsed, sharp investors bought up assets at a fraction of the price, later seeing their investments skyrocket. The same opportunity presents itself with BTFD Coin today, allowing you to get in early before prices climb. BTFD Coin isn’t just about memes, though—it’s a project with real utility. With features like its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, where users can convert in-game coins to $BTFD tokens, and staking that offers an impressive 90% average APY, this project stands out. If you’re not just looking for a meme coin but a community-focused, high-potential token, BTFD Coin is the way to go. Investment Example: Let’s Put Things in Perspective Let’s break it down: if you invest $6,000 in BTFD Coin at the discounted Stage 7 price of $0.000013 per token, you would be looking at purchasing 93,750,000 $BTFD tokens. Fast forward to the price increase after the presale—if it hits the expected post-presale price of $0.0006, your investment would be worth $56,250. That’s a 9.4x return—impressive, right? As BTFD Coin’s ecosystem grows, with features like staking and P2E, these returns could be even higher. How to Buy BTFD Coin at the Discounted Price So, you’re ready to jump on the BTFD Coin bandwagon at a major discount? Here’s how you can snag your discounted tokens during the presale: Go to the Presale Page: Head over to BTFD Coin’s presale page to get started. Connect Your Wallet: Choose your preferred wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.) and connect it to the presale page. Enter the Bonus Code: Enter the code BIG50 in the bonus code.

Use the BIG50 code today to secure your bonus tokens and position yourself for major returns. Don’t let another meme coin pass you by.

38269914,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634510,1735485299,Bitcoin ATMs increase hit 29-month streak in Australia,"Bitcoin automated teller machines (ATMs) in Australia have been increasing, maintaining a 29-month streak. According to reports, the figure is presently challenging Europe, one of the places with the highest number of Bitcoin ATMs. According to the crypto ATM tracking platform Coin ATM Radar, Australia has witnessed a net positive addition of new Bitcoin ATMs in the last 29 months. According to the platform, the country now has 1,359 Bitcoin ATMs, which represents 3.5% of the ATMs globally. Although the number looks small, it puts Australia in the top 3 in global Bitcoin ATMs held by countries. The number is close to that of Europe, with the data tracker putting the number of Bitcoin ATMs in Europe at around 1,660. If Australia surpasses this number, it will become the third country with the most Bitcoin ATM networks, with the United States and Canada occupying the top two spots. United States lead in Bitcoin ATM ownership According to the report , Australia has about eight crypto ATM operators in charge of the machines. Coinflip leads the charge with about 50% of the total, while Localcoin ranks in second place with about 36% of the machines. Crypto Link, at 6%, ByteFederal Australia, at 2.7%, and Bitrocket, at 2%, make up the top five list. The United States leads other countries in the number of Bitcoin ATMs. The country has had to battle with several regulatory issues in its crypto market, leaving users seeking clarity. That, however, did not stop the country from dominating the Bitcoin ATM market. Presently, the country has 31,516 Bitcoin ATMs. The figure means the United States has about 81.3% of its Bitcoin ATMs globally. Canada, which has made fairly limited noise in the crypto industry, ranks second. The country has about 3,027 Bitcoin ATMs, representing 7.8% of the entire Bitcoin ATM market. The United States and Canada have a cumulative 34,543 total Bitcoin ATMs, putting North America around 90% of the total, according to continents. Europe and Oceania share 4% of the total number, with Australia at 3.5%. Asia boasts 0.9% of the total, while Africa was nowhere on the list. In total, the number of Bitcoin ATMs in the world is 38, 753. Regulators issue warnings over increase in scams on Bitcoin ATMs With the rise of Bitcoin ATM machines, there has been an increase in the cases of scammers using the machines. The United States Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) recently warned users about the rise in bad actors using machines to carry out their criminal activities. The body highlighted that the criminals were using the anonymity and speed of the machines to their advantage. The FTC noted that users should be wary of criminals impersonating firms to ask for Bitcoin via ATM machines, noting that no reputable firm will do that. The body also said users should be careful when making transactions and refrain from sending funds to users with hidden identities. United States lawmakers have also previously sent letters to ATM providers about the rising number of scams targeting Bitcoin ATM users in the country. They asked them to investigate fraudulent activities targeting people, especially elderly ones. In the letter, one of the authors, Senator Elizabeth Warren, cited the $65 million loss to Bitcoin ATM scams, calling it alarming. The Senators mentioned that the reason why the criminals are targeting older people is because they are unlikely to report such losses. They also cited a report of a business owner who removed a Bitcoin ATM, claiming that only scammers were using it. A New York Times report also revealed the same thing, noting that the scams targeted older Americans.

But financial markets don’t get this tailwind every year. This year, the Nasdaq Composite and Bitcoin’s price rallied on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, but a Grinch of a pullback in the latter half of the week threatens to steal the Santa rally. Santa Claus No Show For Stocks, Crypto Bitcoin’s price was down over 2% for the 7-day period by lunchtime on Sunday in San Francisco. That’s despite edging up 0.8% for the elapsing daily window with markedly declining 24-hour trade volume. Meanwhile, Ethereum managed to pull a 1.5% daily candle out of the slow week, mostly on some market price gains on Friday and Saturday. Santa wasn’t completely absent, however, for BNB (with an 11.5% 7D candle), Solana (+8%), and Toncoin (+11%). But Fantom (FTM), Ethena (ENA), and Ondo (ONDO) saw steep selloffs for the week after having too much egg nog earlier in December. Everything from Nvidia shares to Ethereum tokens was cooling off Saturday from the last 60 days’ exuberant rallies in both blockchain cryptos and tech stocks. How The Grinch Stole Bitcoin’s Christmas So why aren’t crypto assets and equities in the usual holiday spirit this year? Valuations were already steep going into the holidays. The ebullient Trump bump since Nov. 5 sent markets flying high in the hopes of four good years ahead for cryptocurrency and US businesses. Moreover, there’s been a Bitcoin miner selloff amid rising energy prices all year. The Bitcoin miner sales gathered pace this December into the holiday season. The tech stock slump may also be dragging down the average exchange rate of major cryptocurrencies. The BTC Pearson 30-day correlation to Nasdaq stocks has been rising since July to in sync over 70% of the time. But just like baseball, in financial markets, it isn’t over until it’s over, and there are still three days left in the year to see which way markets move next.

Ethereum ( ETH ) was trading at $3,400 on Dec. 29, down by over 17.2% from its highest level this month. This retreat occurred as Ethereum continued to see strong fundamentals. Data by SoSoValue shows that the daily inflows jumped by $47.7 million on Friday. The funds have had inflows in the last four consecutive days with two days of outflows over the last 25 days. The cumulative net inflows of these ETFs has moved to over $2.68 billion, bringing the total net assets to over $12.1 billion. The BlackRock Ethereum ETF has had the most inflows, which brought its total assets to $3.58 billion. Grayscale, Fidelity, and Bitwise also offer ETH funds.

ETH staking volume | Source: IntoTheBlock Staking is a process where Ethereum holders delegate their tokens to secure the network. They are in turn paid using its fees, which have been in a slow uptrend in the past few years. According to TokenTerminal , Ethereum generated over $2.4 billion in 2024, making it the second most profitable network in the industry after Tether. Some analysts are optimistic that Ethereum price could bounce back in the near term. In an X post, TMV , a highly followed pundit, predicted that the coin would rebound after completing the fourth section of the Elliot wave, a unique pattern that identifies five stages that assets go through. The fourth wave is usually bearish, while the fifth tends to be bullish. Ethereum price analysis ETH price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that ETH price has retreated after finding substantial resistance at $4,000, the extreme overshoot of the Murrey Math Lines. The coin has moved slightly below the strong pivot reverse point at $3,437. It has also remained above the 100-day moving average, while the accumulation/distribution indicator has risen — a sign that investors are buying. Therefore, technicals, including the Elliot Wave pattern, could bounce back in the coming weeks. If this happens, the next target will be $3,750, the ultimate resistance point of the Murrey Math Lines.

38269103,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99488,1735483629,"Shiba Inu Whales Offload Over 600 Billion SHIB, Eye Key Support Zone for Re-Entry","Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) impressive surge to $0.000033 earlier this month has been eclipsed by a sharp price correction over the past week. At press time on Friday, SHIB was trading at $0.00002191, reflecting a 2% drop in the last week and nearly 20% over the past seven days. A broader cryptocurrency market downturn and substantial sell-offs by SHIB whales largely drive this decline. On Thursday, the blockchain analytics platform Spot Onchain revealed that a prominent SHIB whale made a massive deposit of 399.99 billion SHIB tokens valued at $9.69 million to Gemini. This whale, who initially purchased 15.2 trillion SHIB for just 10 ETH in 2020, has now reaped an estimated profit of $107.7 million, retaining 2 trillion SHIB tokens worth approximately $48.54 million. Notably, last month, the same whale offloaded 100 billion SHIB tokens valued at $2.81 million after eight months of inactivity. Adding to the selloff pressure, Lookonchain, another analytics firm, reported a separate whale that sold 250 billion SHIB ($6.05 million) this week, bringing its total profits to $109 million. Notably, such significant sell-offs have contributed to SHIB’s price downturn, though analysts suggest whales may be preparing for re-entry at a lower price point, anticipating key support levels. A prominent SHIB community analyst, Oscar Ramos, addressed the recent sell-offs in a YouTube video, describing the market conditions as a “bloodbath.” However, Ramos encouraged long-term holders to remain steadfast. “Whales love to cash out on SHIB profits, but this is when dollar-cost averaging comes into play,” Ramos said . “Selling at a loss due to fear does more harm than good. Historically, these corrections are often followed by significant rebounds.” While Ramos acknowledged the short-term volatility, he emphasized the need for patience. “SHIB is building its ecosystem with strategic partnerships. This is not the time to panic but to look at the bigger picture,” he added. And true to Ramo’ assurances, the SHIB community has something to celebrate Amidst the sell-offs. On Thursday, Shytoshi Kusama , the lead developer for Shiba Inu, announced a groundbreaking partnership with Chainlink. The collaboration introduces cross-chain interoperability to the Shiba Inu ecosystem through Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Token (CCT) standard, making SHIB assets available on 12 blockchains. “This is HUGE news for the SHIBARMY and SHIB, BONE, AND LEASH. Expect much more from this partnershib” Kusama tweeted . The partnership also introduces the integration of Chainlink Data Streams, aimed at improving market data accuracy and enabling advanced decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. This feature has the potential to significantly enhance SHIB’s appeal to both institutional and retail investors.

Crypto scams have surged in France, leaving thousands financially and emotionally devastated. Fraudsters are finding new ways around even the most intense regulatory measures, including advanced technologies like AI to make their schemes more convincing. The allure of cryptocurrencies often blinds investors to the dangers; caution is called for. Crypto Scams: A Growing Threat Recent figures demonstrate the incredible rise in crypto fraud within France: 3.2% of the population reported having been scammed in 2024, from just 1.2% in 2021. Victims of fictitious loans report average losses of €19,000, while fraudulent savings accounts cost individuals up to €69,000. The notorious “OmegaPro” case saw investigators recover €268 million in criminal assets. Fraudsters often pretend to be celebrities, public figures, or financial experts to make victims do their bidding. Fraudsters use AI to make the story sound plausible, hence turning a mere scam into an authentic one. The consequence is enormous losses in potential revenue and a lack of faith in the crypto markets. How Regulators Are Pushing Back The regulators have started to clamp down harder on crypto fraudsters in France: Blacklisted 5,000 unauthorized entities since 2022 Spotted and blocked 350 fraud websites. Some campaigns have been run to make investors aware of the risks, but the scammers are constantly finding ways to adapt. Among fraudsters’ current favorites, so-called “square” fraud involves re-contacting past victims with promises of help in recovering lost money before further exploiting them. How to Protect Yourself: Investors Beware The French Financial Markets Authority has given some lucid advice on how individuals can look after themselves. Among this advice is checking any investment entity or platform against official registers. Be wary of promises of quick or exorbitant returns. Never give out sensitive information to sources that are unverified. Report immediately to the authorities any suspicious activities. As the AMF warns, “If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.” Vigilance and education are the strongest tools against these ever-evolving scams.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,BTC Pulse,https://btc-pulse.com/crypto-scams-5000-entities-banned-france-innovating/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png

Sui According to DeFi Llama , Sui tokens worth over $138 million will be unlocked on Tuesday, These tokens are part of the monthly unlocks that will happen until September 2069, when the total supply will reach 10 billion. The four-hour chart shows that the SUI price peaked at $4.9536 this month and then dropped to the current $4.2. While it has moved below the 50-day moving average, it has also formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern, pointing to a potential rebound in the coming days.

TRON (TRX): A Decentralized Platform for Content Creators TRON (TRX) is a blockchain-based platform launched in 2017 by the Tron Foundation. It aims to give full ownership rights to digital content creators. Originally, TRX tokens were ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum but moved to their own network in 2018. The platform connects content creators directly with consumers, removing intermediaries like YouTube or Facebook. TRON supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), using a transaction model similar to Bitcoin’s UTXO. Developers can create dApps on TRON as an alternative to Ethereum. The platform’s low transaction fees and focus on decentralization make it attractive. In the current market cycle, TRON’s potential to empower creators may appeal to users and investors. Cardano (ADA): A Scalable and Sustainable Blockchain Platform Cardano is a flexible blockchain platform designed for smart contracts, enabling the development of decentralized finance apps, tokens, and games. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, allows users to store value, make payments, and stake on the network. Cardano uses the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, which is more energy-efficient than proof-of-work models. The blockchain is divided into two layers: the Settlement Layer for transactions and the Computing Layer for smart contracts. This design enhances transaction speeds, potentially up to a million per second. Cardano’s technology offers efficiency and scalability. In the current market cycle, ADA’s features make it an attractive option for users and developers. ConclusKion Although TRX and ADA may offer less short-term potential, Catzilla stands out as a promising meme coin aiming to bring financial freedom to all. With triple utility—governance features, loyalty rewards, and passive staking options—Catzilla unites crypto enthusiasts, meme fans, and anime lovers in a community-driven effort to challenge established systems and reach new heights.

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE.

But even more interesting is Lunex Network’s DEX platform which is beginning to draw more attention. Lunex Network’s versatile approach to DeFi attracts institutional investors Beyond its presale success, Lunex Network has been drawing attention largely because of its unique approach to solving DeFi challenges. The new platform particularly streamlines the crypto transaction process, shifting from the typical cumbersome method. As such, users can send any base cryptocurrency in their portfolio and have it remitted in other cryptocurrencies. Not only does this save time, but it also fast track the processing time. While it allows users to send over 50,000 crypto assets across multiple isolated blockchains, Lunex Network further ensures that users get the cheapest rate possible for all their transactions which are completely executed anonymously. Additionally, Lunex network provides passive revenue for token holders; the platform allocates a portion of the revenue generated from the exchange to buy back tokens in the open market and redistribute among eligible participants. Furthermore, Lunex Network caters to all categories of users, including institutional players. As such, it offers advanced services like a B2B merchant payment gateway that allows businesses to accept crypto payment and instantly convert to fiat. Similarly, developers can access over 65 plus RPC nodes for web3 development. While these attributes establish the platform as a versatile one, they contribute significantly to its growing success. Ripple token faces major resistance below the $2.20 price level Following a noticeable rally in the past few weeks, Ripple price is now facing a major resistance below $2.20. The top altcoin has been trading within a weekly price range of $2.18 and $2.15, which reflects less than 1% decline in the past week. While the minor retracement can be attributed to the broader market sluggish momentum, XRP price still maintains a generally bullish price trajectory. Notably, XRP monthly chart reflects roughly 50% gain, which contributes significantly to its over 240% year-to-date price gain. As market analysts and token holders anticipate a breakout past the crucial level, top analysts like Andrew Griffiths hold a very bullish stance on a potential price breakout. In a recent X post, Andrew noted that XRP price could go up anytime soon if the current support level above $2.16 is not breached. Corroborating this claim, XRP token’s technical analysis , including 30, 50, and 200-day EMAs point at a strong buy, which further suggest an imminent breakout. XRP vs. LNEX: Which can deliver more return in q1 2025? Both Ripple and Lunex Network have demonstrated exceptional prowess during the ongoing bull cycle. While it is too early to determine which one will outperform the other, it is important to highlight both project’s strengths that are capable of driving growth. For XRP, Ripple Lab’s recent clearance by the SEC means more expansion plans that could attract more users. Lunex Network, on the other hand, is leveraging advanced institutional features to tap into a broader market. As such, both altcoins are set for exponential growth in the coming year with major growth projections speculated for the first quarter of 2025.

In his latest newsletter, published Tuesday, Balchunas outlined a projected timeline for approvals, shaped by shifting SEC policies and evolving market dynamics. “We expect a wave of cryptocurrency ETFs next year, albeit not all at once.” Balchunas noted . “First out is likely the BTC and ETH combo ETFs, then prob Litecoin (because its fork of BTC = commodity), then HBAR (because its not labeled security), and then XRP/Solana (which have been labeled securities in pending lawsuits),” added Balchunas. The analyst further reflected on the SEC’s ongoing stance toward crypto regulation, particularly its handling of XRP and Solana, with both tokens embroiled in legal battles over their classification as securities. The SEC’s case against Ripple, initiated in December 2020, directly targets XRP, while Solana has also been labeled an unregistered security in the agency’s lawsuits against Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken. Balchunas explained that these legal issues will delay the approval of XRP and Solana ETFs, stating, “ Even then, complex legal issues around these tokens and others relating to their status as securities may need to be resolved.” However, in contrast, Litecoin and Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) may face fewer hurdles. He noted that Litecoin, a Bitcoin fork, is more likely to be viewed by regulators as a commodity rather than a security. Similarly, HBAR has not been labeled a security by the SEC, which improves its odds for approval. Balchunas pointed out that “new issuer Canary is the only filer for a Litecoin or HBAR ETF,” though he acknowledged the uncertainty around investor demand for these funds. Balchunas has also speculated on the potential emergence of more unconventional ETFs. Last month, he noted , “ 12/31 feels like a good over/under date for Doge filing,” suggesting that even a Dogecoin ETF could materialize before the year ends. That said, the broader crypto ETF landscape is also evolving. Ethereum ETFs approved by the SEC as commodity-based funds offer potential issuers a model to challenge the security status of other tokens. However, analysts warn that progress on new crypto ETFs remains unlikely under the current SEC leadership. As ETFStore President Nate Geraci remarked earlier this month, “ There will be no movement on spot crypto ETF applications until new management comes in .” Meanwhile, the timeline for Solana ETFs is particularly contentious. Earlier this month, the SEC rejected two of five pending Solana ETF applications, prompting predictions that further action will wait until the expected leadership changes in 2025.",NEUTRAL,XRP | HBAR,LTC | REGULATION | SOL | XRP | HBAR,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bloomberg-analyst-predicts-timeline-for-approval-of-xrp-litecoin-and-solana-spot-etfs/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

38268184,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99484,1735481368,Dogecoin About To Explode? Billionaire Elon Musk Says ‘Its Time’ To Start Using DOGE In Big Way,"Dogecoin has had a knockout year, from smashing a three-year record price to becoming the namesake of the newly elected Donald Trump’s initiative, the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.). And now Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, looks determined to take the Shiba Inu-inspired meme coin to the moon. Musk believes that perhaps the time has come to begin using Dogecoin in a big way. T.I.T.S. University Accepting Dogecoin As Tuition Finally Coming? Katherine Boyle, General Partner at Andreessen Horowitz, recently revived the idea of starting a new university: Texas Institute of Technology & Science. Musk commented on Boyle’s post: “Maybe it is time!” Maybe it is time! — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 28, 2024 As you may recall, in 2021, Musk floated the idea of establishing the Texas Institute of Technology & Science, with the TITS acronym, saying it would have “epic merch.” Then-MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor reacted to the idea, stating: “I hope you teach your students that: Bitcoin Offers Outstanding Benefits, Seriously.” At the time, the self-proclaimed Dogefather claimed that the university would accept Dogecoin solely for tuition and that people who owned pet dogs would receive discounts. If TITS becomes a reality, it would spur a huge real-life use case for the OG meme coin and propel its mainstream adoption to a whole other level. DOGE TO $1? In other related news, President-elect Trump tapped Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a new U.S. department that shares a name with Dogecoin, much to the excitement of DOGE holders. The Department of Government Efficiency plans to reduce U.S. government spending and streamline regulations. Meanwhile, Trader Tardigrade, a market pattern analyst, mentioned in an X post that Dogecoin’s Rate of Change (ROC) indicator is signaling a potential parabolic surge in the coming weeks. According to Tardigrade, the present DOGE ROC is similar to the action witnessed weeks before the 2021 historic rally. “If history repeats, a significant surge could be ahead,” the analyst posited. In other words, DOGE could break the $1 threshold and beyond if the meme coin repeats the 2021 trend.",POSITIVE,DOGE,DOGE | SHIB | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/dogecoin-about-to-explode-billionaire-elon-musk-says-its-time-to-start-using-doge-in-big-way/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png
38268201,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634495,1735481272,DeFi has 3 options if IRS rules remain – Alex Thorn,"The IRS’s new rules classify DeFi platforms as brokers and mandate KYC and transaction reporting. DeFi services must choose between compliance, blocking U.S. users, or fully decentralizing. Each path carries risks and could significantly impact the future of decentralized finance. The IRS recently introduced reporting regulations that could the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. The regulations classify DeFi platforms and front-ends as brokers that will have to report intricate transactions and user information. The IRS final reporting rule, issued on December 27, 2024, expands the definition of “a broker” to include DeFi front-end platforms. It goes without saying that platforms such as Uniswap, which allows users to buy and sell digital assets through smart contracts, must eventually conform to KYC regulations and report user transaction data. These regulations pose very serious challenges to DeFi applications because most of them were founded on the principles of decentralization and privacy. Such regulation might stifle innovation and send platforms offshore, opposing what is essentially the crypto world’s basic ethos. With the deadlines approaching, the industry needs to decide how to adapt to these rules. Alex Thorn, the head of research at Galaxy Digital, has mentioned three possible paths in case the IRS rules are not reversed. Option 1: Compliance with the IRS’ rules The first option for the DeFi platforms is to comply with the new IRS rules. This will involve introducing KYC protocols, gathering user data, and then reporting transactions to the IRS. Yet, compliance is easier said than done. Many DeFi platforms operate through decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) or with non-upgradeable smart contracts, it’s rather hard to implement such changes. Compliance would also exclude users who value privacy and decentralization. Furthermore, the added administrative and technical overhead might make operations infeasible for smaller projects. However, for platforms that are willing to make these concessions, compliance provides a means of continuing to serve U.S. users and operating within the law. Option 2: Block U.S. users The other alternative is to entirely shut out U.S. users. Some DeFi applications have resorted to shutting down their websites or even deactivating features for users in the United States. This measure has helped platforms dodge regulations, but it also limits exposure to potential users. The global DeFi ecosystem would be further fragmented as platforms focus on areas where regulations are relatively easier to follow. The risk, though is that many in the United States crypto community will be excluded, which will slow wider adoption of DeFi. Option 3: Deep decentralization Thorne’s third option is for protocols to give up revenue generation and smart contract upgrades in exchange for full decentralization. In this model, the DeFi applications would lose any front-end interfaces or the influence of centralized teams. All operations would be done with immutable smart contracts and community-oriented governance. By becoming “highly decentralized,” platforms would likely be able to avoid being a “broker” as they could not collect information about their users or command the transaction. This approach follows the tenets of decentralization, but it also poses its own problems. Innovation might be constrained, friendliness for users may decrease, and the ability to monetize would be hampered. It estimates the new rules will hit an additional 875 DeFi operators, as well as approximately 2.6 million U.S.-based taxpayers. Industry critics have argued against such rules as “abysmally heavy.” They have even launched actions about illegal imposition. Critics fear that the IRS may shift DeFi innovation outside the United States and ultimately hurt the U.S. crypto industry. The Blockchain Association branded the rules a “privacy violation” and voiced the concern that it may deter developers from advancing the DeFi space. The public can comment on this proposed rule until October 30, 2025. The agency has also tentatively scheduled a public hearing for November 7, 2025. These compliance deadlines should not pass without the industry preparing DeFi platforms for the change in operations. Three options, as represented by Thorn, are the difficult choices facing the DeFi industry. Compliance may bring legitimacy at a high cost to decentralization and privacy. Blocking U.S. users would shield platforms from regulatory risks but could limit their growth potential. Deep decentralization could keep the principles of DeFi intact, but usability and innovation would have to be sacrificed. The new IRS rules have put DeFi at a crossroads. Companies must choose to comply, block U.S. users, or go fully decentralized.

Investors eye Lightchain AI, blending AI and blockchain, as it gains momentum post-Dogecoin surge with its $0.003 presale. Table of Contents Dogecoin and the rise of meme coins Can Lightchain AI rise above the meme coin craze? Can we say for certain that Lightchain AI will succeed? In the wake of Dogecoin ’s remarkable market explosion, investors are actively seeking the next big opportunity in the cryptocurrency space. Lightchain AI has emerged as a promising contender, offering a unique combination of artificial intelligence and blockchain unique features. Unlike Dogecoin, which gained traction primarily as a meme coin, Lightchain AI focuses on solving real-world problems through its advanced features such as the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM). These technologies enable scalable, intelligent applications across industries, making it more than just a speculative asset. As Lightchain AI continues to gain momentum, its current presale , priced at $0.003, presents an early entry point for investors looking to capitalize on a token with the potential for substantial growth in both value and utility. Dogecoin and the rise of meme coins Dogecoin’s rise is a good example of how funny coins can get big notice and see fast growth. First started as a laugh, Dogecoin got a huge group of fans thanks to its fun style and strong community help. It turned into one of the best-known digital currencies, mostly pushed by social media buzz and the support of famous people, especially from folks like Elon Musk. While Dogecoin has had a big jump, it has gotten some complaints for not having basic uses and tech progress. This made folks curious about other meme coins, but they usually run into the same issues. Even with the buzz around meme coins, their lasting power and real worth are still unknown. Now, buyers ask: can meme coins keep doing well or will projects with better tech growth, like Lightchain AI, take the spotlight in crypto’s future? You might also like: Lightchain AI among the most talked-about token of the next bull run Can Lightchain AI rise above the meme coin craze? While meme coins like Dogecoin have demonstrated the power of community-driven growth, Lightchain AI offers something fundamentally different: real-world utility through artificial intelligence integration with blockchain technology. Meme coins, which rely on social media hype and celebrity endorsements, Lightchain AI is built on its groundbreaking Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM). These features enable decentralized, AI-driven applications that solve complex problems in industries like healthcare, finance, and supply chain. As the cryptocurrency market matures, investors are increasingly looking for projects that offer long-term value and scalable solutions. With its unique blend of AI and blockchain, Lightchain AI is positioned to rise above the meme coin craze, offering both innovation and utility that could make it a major player in the next phase of cryptocurrency growth. Can we say for certain that Lightchain AI will succeed? As with any investment, there are no guarantees of success. However, Lightchain AI’s cutting-edge technology and strong team make it well-positioned to thrive in the growing cryptocurrency market. The project has already garnered significant interest from investors and partnerships with major players in various industries. Furthermore, Lightchain AI has a clear roadmap for development and expansion, indicating a dedicated effort towards achieving long-term sustainability and growth. Lightchain AI has the potential to become a major player in the crypto space, but only time will tell if it lives up to its promise.

38267996,https://crypto.news/?p=14323011,1735481111,Bitcoin sits at key price ahead of a potential ‘January effect’,"Bitcoin price has moved into a technical correction and found support at the 50-day moving average. Bitcoin ( BTC ) retreated to $94,830, down by over 12% from its highest level this month as the Santa Claus rally failed to materialize. The retreat happened in a low-volume environment, as many investors and traders remained in the Christmas season mode. According to CoinGecko , Bitcoin’s volume of $22 billion on Sunday, Dec. 29 was down from $41 billion a day earlier. Its volume on Friday was $45 billion, higher than $33 billion on Thursday. Bitcoin tends to have daily volume of over $100 billion in normal market conditions. Bitcoin lost its momentum after the Federal Reserve delivered a highly hawkish monetary policy meeting earlier this month. It slashed interest rates by 0.25%, while its dot plot pointed to just two cuts. The Fed had hinted that it would deliver as many as four cuts in 2025. Bitcoin has also struggled as doubts about a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve fell and ETF inflows retreated. Polymarket odds of Donald Trump creating these reserves in the first 100 days have dropped to 29%, down from the November high of 60%. You might also like: US will not approve strategic Bitcoin reserve: CryptoQuant CEO Meanwhile, ETF inflows have been sluggish in the past few days. Data by SoSoValue shows that Bitcoin ETFs have shed assets in 6 of the last seven market days. These funds have accumulated net assets of $35.6 billion since inception. Will BTC have a January effect? The so-called Santa Claus rally, where assets rally ahead of Dec. 25, did not come to fruition. Therefore, Bitcoin investors hope that it will achieve a so-called January effect — a theory that suggests most financial assets (i.e., stocks and crypto) rally in the first month of the year as participants create their portfolios. History suggests that Bitcoin does not necessarily have strong gains in January. As shown below, BTC was positive six times since 2023. It rose by just 0.62% in this year’s January and 39% a year earlier. February is usually a strong month for Bitcoin; it moved in the red just two times. Bitcoin performance per month | Source: CoinGlass Bitcoin price is at a crucial support The daily chart shows that Bitcoin is at a crucial support level, which could point to more gains in the coming weeks. It has found support at the 50-day moving average. Also, the coin has failed to move below the ascending trendline that connects the lowest swings since Nov. 17. The risk, however, is that the coin has formed a rising broadening wedge pattern, a popular bearish sign. Therefore, a drop below its lower side may point to more downside, potentially to $73,777, its March high.

What Role Does 1Fuel Ecosystem Play in Cross-Chain Finance?,"Tron and Avalanche are looking to attract more users to their network with more innovations. This could spur positive price actions for their tokens. 1Fuel , a new crypto solution, is also looking to capture many DeFi users with its simpler approach to cross-chain transactions. This could make 1Fuel popular amongst users and set it up for high adoption. Experts have dubbed 1Fuel the next big thing in crypto , making the ongoing presale a smart investment to consider. 1Fuel set to revolutionize cross-chain finance Cross-chain transactions on existing platforms have been complex. Users have had to hold multiple wallets and pay higher fees to swap or transact with different crypto assets on different networks. However, 1Fuel is bringing a new dawn. The innovative crypto wallet will make the process easier while handling the complexities in the background. With 1Fuel , users will enjoy lower fees and faster transactions. There will be no complexities, giving room for people with little DeFi knowledge to thrive. The crypto solution is built to serve everyone, and the ecosystem will have different opportunities for every participant. Traders, liquidity providers, stakers, and token holders will have incentives and rewards in the 1Fuel ecosystem. The 1Fuel functionality will also extend beyond cross-chain finance. It will touch on asset storage and security, data protection and privacy, portfolio management, as well as peer-to-peer exchange. 1Fuel is determined to serve users in every way possible, and this will make it a project of high importance. The 1Fuel token is in line to be the next big thing in crypto, and its presale is a medium for investors to enjoy a possibly high return. Tron eyes higher adoption and improved market value Tron is looking to entice more users with better efficiency and helpful innovations. The Tron network is already known for being swift and affordable for stablecoin transfers, and it’s looking to build on that to improve. Analysts believe this spells good news for Tron investors, as the token is expected to rise with the network’s growth. The Tron token currently trades at $0.25 after falling more than 43% from its all-time high of $0.44 on December 4th. However, Tron is expected to rally back towards $0.40 in Q1, but it must first break the resistance at $0.30. While Tron isn’t most investors’ top crypto investment option , it could still yield a fair return, especially with more innovation in the network. Avalanche aims to drive positive price action with network improvement Avalanche is one of the top DeFi platforms in the crypto space. However, the Avalanche token is currently performing poorly. The altcoin has dipped by about 11% in the past month, and the projection doesn’t look promising at the moment. Market observers are, however, convinced that developers’ actions could see Avalanche pump. This theory could be tested as early as the coming weeks, as Avalanche just launched a new upgrade on its mainnet. The Avalanche9000 upgrade is meant to reduce deployment costs by 99.9% for L1 blockchains. This could drive more users to Avalanche and consequently spur an upward price movement for the Avalanche token. The new upgrade will also give developers full control over staking and enable customizable permissions. This will make the network more attractive and position the Avalanche token for a possible rally. Hence, it’s a top crypto investment option . Conclusion Avalanche and Tron could drive good price action by improving their networks. However, they’re likely to still be behind 1Fuel , due to its advanced features. The new crypto project looks well-positioned to take over the market, and joining the presale could be very rewarding.

Amid this technological transformation, a new player has entered the scene: Nova X , a platform that merges gaming, shopping, and blockchain into what it calls the Digital Arcade Universe . But is Nova X truly the next step forward, or just another fleeting trend? Nova X is not just another gaming platform—it’s a multi-industry ecosystem that reimagines what gaming could be. At its core is the Digital Arcade Universe , an online space that offers players the chance to engage in interactive games, earn in-game rewards called Nova Gems , and redeem these for real-world value. What sets Nova X apart is its approach to blending gaming with online shopping and blockchain technology. Players can convert their earned Coupon X —a secondary reward currency—into real-life products, services, or even subscriptions on its Nova X Marketplace . This integration could appeal to a wide audience, from casual gamers to deal-savvy shoppers. Nova X’s potential lies in the industries it bridges. Gaming alone is a $200 billion industry, while online shopping has surpassed $5 trillion globally, and blockchain continues to disrupt sectors with its transparency and security. If Nova X can capture even 1% of these massive markets, it stands to position itself as a major force in the tech and entertainment world. While the vision is ambitious, critics question the scalability of the platform. Can Nova X deliver on its promises of blending three industries seamlessly? And more importantly, will it attract a large enough player base to make the ecosystem sustainable? Early adoption will likely be key, as well as building trust in its blockchain-backed systems. Nova X isn’t just about playing games—it’s about creating a lifestyle. Whether it becomes the next big thing depends on its execution and how well it can unite its audience around its ambitious goals.

The recent RLUSD stablecoin launch has led many insiders to predict astonishing cycle targets for Ripple, on the back of massive inflows and incredible hype. The bullish factors continue to stack up to make Ripple an enticing proposition for the remainder of this bull run. Ripple (XRP) Stablecoin Launch Sees A Flurry Of Interest Ripple has surprised even the most ardent members of the Ripple Army with the strength of its recent market moves as Ripple has rallied by 427% in the last six months. This has sent the Ripple price up to $2.17 and secured Ripple at number four in the CoinMarketCap crypto top 5 index. Only Bitcoin and Ethereum are currently trading with larger market caps than Ripple, which has a total value of $147.3 billion. Ripple recently launched the dollar-backed RLUSD stablecoin, which is now live on global crypto exchanges. RLUSD is fully collateralized by dollar deposits and will expand Ripple’s offering across other blockchain and DeFi platforms. This launch has gone a long way to restore institutional investors’ confidence in the Ripple ecosystem and could see Ripple reach up to $20 at the peak of this bull run. There are also rumors circulating that Ripple will be granted its dedicated spot ETF fund in the US, which would further accelerate Ripple’s dominance. Rollblock (RBLK) Bringing Trust Back To Online Gaming Rollblock (RBLK) looks set to dominate in its own sphere of crypto gaming, thanks to its impressive GambleFi offering that has the potential to disrupt the $450 billion online gaming sector. It ensures that no manipulation can take place on its platform thanks to the way it secures all transactions using the Ethereum blockchain. RLBK gamers no longer have to blindly trust that the casino will do the right thing. Instead, gamers can verify that everything is fully above board and as it should be with only a couple of clicks. Rollblock has been making consistent new highs since its inception this year but has recently seen a flurry of new investors step up to make an allocation. Currently in stage 9 and offering RBLK tokens for an early-stage discount of just $0.044, the Rollblock presale offers investors a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get in on the ground floor of this hugely promising game-changer for the P2E space. RBLK has incredibly bullish tokenomics and will see its supply trend lower over time thanks to the revenue share mechanism that uses the platform’s profits to burn masses of RBLK tokens each week. It also enables community members to earn generous staking yields on their tokens. Small Cap Rollblock Looks Likely To Outperform Big Players As Ripple looks set to increase its dominance in Web3 payments, Rollblock (RBLK) has emerged as a similarly disruptive project that offers an incredible risk-reward ratio at this point in its development.

XRP established and resilient XRP has been an important player in the coin market known for mak͏ing quick and cheap payments across borders. Its cost guesses now differ among experts, mainly based on the results of court fights and its use in the money field. Law changes have a big part in forming XRP’s cost. Good decisions in current law matters might cause a large rise in price, with experts expecting between $1.50 to $3 in the near to middle term Also, Ripple’s many links with money groups around the world keep making XRP more useful and popular.

By fusing blockchain with artificial intelligence, it’s creating a platform that’s not just smart but scalable, sustainable, and seriously useful. With tokens priced at just $0.003 during presale, investors are buzzing about its breakout potential. Ready to hop on board? Why Lightchain AI is the talk of the town Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) Think of it as AI on steroids. The AIVM lets developers plug AI-powered apps directly into blockchain ecosystems, making it a game-changer for industries like healthcare, finance, and logistics. Proof of Intelligence (PoI) Why mine coins when someone can mine brainpower? PoI rewards nodes for doing AI computations, giving machine learning and predictive analytics a major boost. Transparent AI Framework No shady black-box AI here. Lightchain AI keeps all decision-making open and audit-friendly, earning trust the smart way. Decentralized Governance Integration AI meets democracy. Lightchain AI blends decentralized governance with AI for community-led, smarter decision-making. Scalability and Efficiency Big brain, big power. The platform handles high transaction volumes and AI tasks like a pro, making it perfect for industries that demand both. Privacy and Security Paranoid about data breaches? That’s one of the areas Lightchain AI is good at. It prioritizes privacy and security, making it a natural fit for sensitive fields like healthcare and finance. Community Engagement No lone wolves here. Lightchain AI thrives on global collaboration, inviting developers from all over to build, improve, and innovate. Lightchain AI isn’t just keeping up with the future — it’s inventing it. Lightchain AI vs. XRP investment outlook XRP has established itself as a mature player in the market, with regulatory clarity and strong institutional partnerships positioning it as a stable investment option. Once its legal issues are resolved, XRP holds significant upside potential. However, its reliance on traditional systems and limited innovation could pose challenges to its long-term appeal, especially in a rapidly evolving market. On the other hand, Lightchain AI is a rising star that combines AI and blockchain to create a cutting-edge platform with vast scalability and utility. This positions it as a high-growth opportunity, especially for investors willing to take calculated risks at its early-stage pricing.

38267364,https://nulltx.com/?p=137091,1735479643,Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Consolidates in Symmetrical Triangle as Market Waits for the Next Shift,"Dogecoin’s current consolidation within a symmetrical triangle pattern means its price could go either way. This is stirring indecision among investors. The market is always moving, and people always talk about the best cryptocurrency to invest in. Can DOGE maintain its stability, or do newer altcoins like 1Fuel (OFT) offer better growth potential? As Dogecoin retains the number one meme-coin legacy, 1Fuel is gaining traction with cutting-edge features and seamless cross-chain functionality. During 1Fuel’s ongoing presale alone, early investors could see returns of 500% or more! Could this be the shift the market is waiting for? Dogecoin’s price movement: What’s happening? DOGE is currently in a consolidation phase. This is the pattern that often occurs before the price either goes up or down. This technical setup creates tension between buyers and sellers. No one knows for sure if Dogecoin will rise or fall. DOGE is sitting comfortably at $0.31, a position that reflects its resilience despite broader market fluctuations. Analysts indicate that DOGE’s increased volume and growing market sentiment are key triggers for a price breakout. Unlike 1Fuel that offers real-world uses like cross-chain compatibility off the bat, Dogecoin’s utility remains largely tied to social hype and speculative trading. DOGE may be attractive to short-term traders while 1Fuel could appeal to investors looking for seamless crypto transfers without managing multiple wallets. What’s driving DOGE and 1Fuel trends? For a pioneer memecoin like DOGE, there are several factors that keep it relevant even to this day. First, Dogecoin has some serious whale activity in play. These are large holders with wallets of up to 250 million DOGE. Dogecoin’s meme status and multiple endorsements from different celebrities are some of the things that keep it at the top of crypto conversations. The token often has symmetrical triangles that signal large price swings. Experienced traders have the flexibility to go long or short based on their market analysis. 1Fuel, on the other hand, is a new altcoin making waves with over $850k done in its ongoing presale stage. This token makes it seamless to transfer across different blockchains, eliminating the need for multiple wallets. All these are at the lowest possible fees. 1Fuel holders can enjoy staking rewards of up to 30% APR. This means you can earn passive income just by holding 1Fuel, turning your investment into a continuous revenue stream. DOGE vs. 1Fuel—Which is better for long-term investment? For which token is the best cryptocurrency to invest in, we believe that depends on each investor. Dogecoin’s longevity and mainstream recognition are an asset. However, it lacks advanced features like smart contracts or cross-chain capabilities. This makes it open to competition from utility-driven tokens like 1Fuel. On the plus side for DOGE, it’s starting to get accepted by major brands for payments. Adding its active community backed by Elon Musk, Dogecoin is a top contender for the best cryptocurrencies to buy today. But if you’re an investor looking for functional features and scalability. 1Fuel is your go-to coin. Conclusion Dogecoin’s possible breakout up or down keeps investors asking about its long-term competitiveness. Meanwhile, 1Fuel is coming in from another angle, focusing on cross-chain compatibility, efficiency, and scalability. If you’re looking for fast gains, DOGE remains attractive. However, if you’re looking for tokens that solve actual problems, 1Fuel’s focus on solving blockchain inefficiencies positions it as one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy.

38267371,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634496,1735479444,Exposed: Hackers now using LinkedIn to scam crypto users,"Hackers have now started to use the popular application LinkedIn to scam unsuspecting cryptocurrency users. With the hackers now migrating their tactics and illegal activities to LinkedIn, it adds to a list of sophisticated attacks across several platforms with the singular aim of stealing people’s digital assets. According to Web3 security expert Taylor Monahan (Tayvano) on X, hackers are reportedly using specialized social media-based propaganda to distribute malware. After the malware does its job, the victims typically lose control of their devices, after which the criminals carry out their attacks. Monahan gave a detailed explanation of how the attackers work and how users can be safe. Web3 security analyst details go to avoid hackers According to Monahan’s post on X, the hackers begin their illegal operations by opening fake LinkedIn profiles that appear credible. The next step is to impersonate popular platforms, posing as recruiters. The hackers initiate conversations with their victims and try to keep the conversations going to build trust. 🚨 Heads up all—some dudes have a slick, new way of dropping some nasty malware. Feels infostealer-y on the surface but…its not.🫠 It'll really, deeply rekt you. Pls share this w/ your friends, devs, and multisig signers. Everyone needs to be careful + stay skeptical. 🙏 pic.twitter.com/KRRWGL3GDo — Tay 💖 (@tayvano_) December 28, 2024 After building trust with their victims, the hackers bamboozle them with mouth-watering employment opportunities. The tactic often achieves its purpose, especially among users seeking active employment. Monahan noted that it also works with those not seeking employment because everybody is looking for ways to increase their income stream. To further prove to their victims that the job opportunities are indeed legal, they employ the aid of several tools. For instance, they use the Willo Video interviewing platform, one that is frequently used by most crypto firms when interviewing candidates for positions. Victims are also provided with job details and descriptions, which increases the depth of the deception. The victims are required to record and send their responses on the platform. However, the hackers proceed without actually using the platform’s video features, citing different technical issues to keep the con going. After this stage, the hackers begin their scam, sending their victims a link containing harmful instructions. Once they follow the instructions, their devices are compromised, helping the hackers gain access. Monahan warns the crypto community about social engineering scheme According to Monahan, once a user clicks the link, they automatically cede control to the hackers irrespective of the device they use. “If you follow their instructions, you are fcked. They vary depending on whether you are on Mac/Windows/Linux. But once you do it, Chrome will prompt you to update/restart to “fix the issue.” It’s not fixing the issue. It’s fully fcking you,” Monahan said. It is still unclear the spread of the hack or how much they have recouped, but the incident is closely related to the ones that have occurred in the past. The popular one involved employees of the popular Japanese crypto firm Ginco. The wallet software firm lost about $305 million to hackers via the same social engineering attacks. The breach was investigated by several bodies including the Federal Bureau of Investigations ( FBI ) and Japan’s National Police Agency. While LinkedIn has taken several measures to remove fake accounts, the issue has remained. The platform claimed that about 80 million fake profiles were removed in 2024. Its automated system, which checks accounts at every step, blocked most of the accounts after creation.

The firm projects a “bear case” scenario where Bitcoin reaches $150,000—a 58% increase from its current $94,981 price—if critical events fail to materialize. Bear Case Puts Bitcoin at $150K by 2025 This scenario assumes that former President Donald Trump, if re-elected, does not implement his proposed Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. While the industry is optimistic that Trump could take executive action early in his term to make Bitcoin a reserve asset, uncertainty remains. Blockware also warns that aggressive Bitcoin selling by long-term holders and Federal Reserve policies reversing interest rate cuts could limit Bitcoin’s growth potential. Jack Mallers, CEO of Strike, expressed hope that Trump would take decisive steps to formalize Bitcoin as a national asset, though the timeline for such action remains unclear. Bull Case Eyes $400K With Strategic Bitcoin Reserve On the higher end of the spectrum, Blockware outlines a “bull case” where Bitcoin’s price could soar to $400,000 by 2025. This outcome depends on three key factors aligning favorably: a more dovish Federal Reserve policy, accelerated corporate adoption of Bitcoin, and the US government actively building its Bitcoin reserves. Corporate adoption plays a critical role in this projection. Blockware notes that if one of the “Magnificent 7” tech giants—Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, or Tesla—adds Bitcoin to its balance sheet, it could catalyze broader adoption and price momentum. However, hurdles remain. For example, Microsoft shareholders recently voted against a resolution to adopt Bitcoin during the company’s annual meeting on Dec. 10. The report also emphasizes that the US government would need to move beyond simply safeguarding its current Bitcoin holdings. While the government possesses approximately 183,850 BTC, valued at $17.36 billion, it would need to actively acquire more Bitcoin to realize the $400,000 target. Galaxy Digital’s Alex Thorn casts doubt on such a scenario. In a Dec. 27 report, Thorn stated that the US government is unlikely to purchase Bitcoin in 2025 , though discussions about a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve may progress.

However, investors are hoping that the BTC price will gift them one final rally before the close of 2024, and the latest on-chain signals suggest so. Can Increased Buying Pressure Push Bitcoin Price Back Toward $100,000? In a December 28th post on the X platform, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared an exciting on-chain observation that could influence the Bitcoin price action before the end of 2024. This relevant on-chain indicator here is the “taker buy/sell ratio,” which tracks the taker buy and taker sell volumes for a specific cryptocurrency. Related Reading: A 20%-30% Correction Is ‘The Most Bullish Thing’ That Could Happen To Bitcoin – Analyst When the value of the taker buy/sell ratio is greater than one, it implies that the taker buy volume is higher than the taker sell volume. This phenomenon is usually considered a bullish signal, which suggests the willingness of investors to pay a higher price for a specific asset (Bitcoin, in this scenario). On the flip side, if the ratio’s value is less than 1, it suggests that more sellers are willing to sell their assets at a lower price. Typically, this means that the selling pressure is overwhelming the buyers in a particular crypto market while reflecting a bearish sentiment amongst investors. Martinez shared in the post on X that the Bitcoin taker buy/sell ratio on the OKX exchange witnessed a notable spike to as high as 2.3 on Saturday, December 28. This piece of data suggests a surge in buying activity on the centralized trading platform. Ultimately, this on-chain signal could be bullish for the flagship cryptocurrency, as the increased buying pressure could infuse some upward momentum in the Bitcoin price. As of this writing, the price of BTC sits just beneath the $95,000 mark, reflecting a 0.6% increase in the past day. BTC Continues To Flow Out Of Exchanges A pseudonymous analyst on the CryptoQuant platform revealed that the amount of BTC flowing into exchanges has hit a multi-year. This is consistent with the low Netflow-to-Reserve ratio, which tracks the difference between exchange netflows and exchange reserves. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Ending 2024 On A High Note? Analysts Say This Level Is Key A negative Netflow-to-Reserve ratio highlights that Bitcoin investors are choosing to keep their assets rather than sell for profits.

Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, it operates on the XRP Ledger—a system without a central authority. This means transactions are secure, irreversible, and don’t need a bank to settle. With its origins in “ripple credits,” XRP aims to facilitate seamless payments between different currencies. Out of the 100 billion XRP initially created, 80 billion were gifted to a company called Ripple. Ripple, formerly known as OpenCoin Inc., uses XRP to support the network and improve liquidity. In today’s market, XRP stands out for its speed and low transaction costs. Ripple has placed 55 billion XRP in escrow to control the supply, ensuring a steady release into the market. This approach helps maintain stability and trust among users. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, XRP’s ability to handle transactions quickly makes it attractive for global payments. As the demand for efficient and borderless financial solutions grows, XRP’s technology positions it as a strong player in the digital currency space. Its focus on bridging different currencies could play a key role in the future of international money transfers.

Prince Elon (ELONPRIN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONPRIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Prince Elon can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Prince Elon could become the next viral memecoin. Prince Elon launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Prince Elon on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Prince Elon by entering its contract address – 7rAsmWGTtPFY9RFnhd9biard7PrWtw5ZigowwfmaXUQ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

There’s a false—and, I would argue, dangerous—belief that in DeFi, strong UX can’t be achieved without some degree of centralization. It’s understandable why some believe this; centralized platforms like Coinbase and Binance are known for their intuitive and accessible interfaces for everyday users. Yet, centralized systems often fall short in areas like transparency and security. You might also like: Composability is the only way DeFi will survive—and thrive | Opinion It’s tempting for DeFi projects, who have by now heard countless times that UX is the missing piece for web3 adoption, to prioritize accessibility over transparency and security for the sake of attracting users. But those lower security standards are likely to come back to bite them someday. Whether true or exaggerated, the message that UX is the final piece to web3’s success pushes too many DeFi developers to think they have to sacrifice decentralization, which would go against DeFi’s very nature and raison d’être . That view is flawed. Decentralization cannot—and doesn’t need to be—sacrificed for a smoother user experience. DeFi can—and must—have both. A reminder of what happens when we sacrifice decentralization Centralized entities in crypto have repeatedly shown their limits. Scandals like the collapse of Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and Celsius demonstrated how centralized entities fail to deliver the reliability and transparency users expect—and can have disastrous consequences. As we saw with the FTX downfall , centralization enabled greater opacity, which hid the reckless decision-making from the public’s view and sent shockwaves through the industry when billions in user assets vanished. FTX users were blind to the risks until it was too late. That’s not the case with decentralized protocols, whose transparency holds them accountable. All transactions are visible on-chain, giving users insights and assurances that don’t exist in their centralized counterparts. DeFi protocols such as Aave, which have been in operation for almost a decade (since 2017), show the viability of decentralized solutions. That doesn’t mean decentralized systems are foolproof—events like Terra’s collapse in 2022 showed that decentralization doesn’t guarantee success. But at least when decentralized protocols fail, they fail with transparency. Users have some degree of visibility and the agency to hold those systems accountable when something does look amiss. Decentralization isn’t incompatible with UX Given the importance of decentralization in DeFi, it’s clear that it cannot be sacrificed for better UX. It also doesn’t have to be. We’re already seeing proof of that. Smart contract improvements, Layer-2 solutions, and intuitive wallet designs are transforming DeFi UX without requiring projects to sacrifice decentralization, as we’ve seen with Uniswap’s wallet and Unichain L2. The obvious challenge of achieving strong UX in DeFi is the industry’s still young age. Centralized apps, which are often web2 structures with crypto features layered on top, naturally offer a smoother experience today because developers have decades of web2 UX experience to build on. That’s not the case with decentralized frameworks, which come with unique scalability, fragmentation, and compliance difficulties. Those challenges are being actively tackled and solved. What are we measuring DeFi up against? How we determine good versus bad UX is also an important consideration, especially when so many critique DeFi for being too complex. Is that not the case, though, for TradFi? Managing multiple accounts across different exchanges or trying to move assets from one brokerage to another are not smooth experiences. DeFi aims to simplify these processes through greater interoperability while introducing the added benefits of transparency, trustlessness, and user control. Its UX may not yet be on par with web2 interfaces, but it’s getting closer. As tools and protocols continue to mature, so will the user experience. It can’t be this or that. We need both The future of finance shouldn’t involve choosing between centralized convenience and decentralized security. We need to demand both, especially as we recognize the failures of centralized entities and the need for greater transparency. The UX gap in DeFi is shrinking. Even if it isn’t closed tomorrow or the day after, there will come a day when users don’t need to choose between an easy-to-use platform and security.

Analysts that the token could mimic the Solana frame as it was launched at $0.50 and rose over $260 at some point. As of now, RXS is trading at $0.175 and this is almost 6x the initial price of $0.03. Analysts suggest the token could surge by 17,100% in the coming months, capturing investor attention. Solana The Foundation of Scalability and Speed Solana (SOL) has now fully positioned itself as one of the leading blockchains in the crypto sphere. Solana which boasts of a high speed of transactions, as well as cost, has contributed significantly to decentralized finance and the minting of non-fungible tokens. In 2023, Solana’s price rose from $19 to an all-time high of $263, representing a staggering 1,200% increase. The blockchain’s growing adoption among developers and investors fueled this growth, with its Total Value Locked (TVL) reaching $8.2 billion. However, as Solana’s ecosystem matures, traders are shifting focus to newer opportunities that promise exponential returns, such as Rexas Finance. Rexas Finance Revolutionizing Real-World Asset Tokenization Rexas Finance is now gaining much attention for implementing a very practical concept that is related to the Tokenization of Real World assets (RWA). It provides an opportunity for tokenization of the various forms of property like real estate, artwork, and other forms of property and share it with the general public. This addresses a critical gap in traditional finance by improving liquidity and reducing entry barriers for small investors. The project’s tools, such as the Rexas Token Builder and Rexas Estate, enable individuals to create tokens and participate in fractional ownership of premium assets. This innovation places Rexas Finance in a strategic place in the RWA sector a market that is expected to be more than $ 16 trillion in 2030. Strong Market Momentum and Security Foundations Rexas Finance has demonstrated robust investor confidence during its ongoing presale, which is now in Stage 11. The token’s value has been increasing from $0.03 to $0.175, with $32.8 million raised, and 378+ million tokens sold. This performance indicates that there is increasing confidence in the long-term prospects of the project. ⭐️ Milestone Alert! ⭐️Rexas Finance has successfully raised $32.8 Million! 🚀Thank you for your support! 👍Buy Now: https://t.co/tNJAsvAL8G #rexas $RXS #RexasFinance #crypto pic.twitter.com/6MSUkUxyMq — Rexas Finance (@rexasfinance) December 23, 2024 To ensure security, Rexas Finance has completed an audit by CertiK, a leading blockchain security firm. This verification assures investors of the platform’s reliability and transparency. Additionally, RXS has been listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, enhancing its visibility among global traders. More people have been drawn to the project due to community-based activities such as the $1 million token giveaway. Twenty participants will receive $50,000 worth of RXS each to increase their awareness and usage in the crypto market. RXS Projected to Outpace Solana’s Growth Cryptocurrency analysts believe that RXS might have the same or better valuation as Solana in the next bull run. Solana rose 42,000% in four years, while RXS will jump 17,100% within four months because it is one of the few projects designed for tokenizing real assets. However, the excellent and constantly expanding ecosystem of Rexas Finance, including DeFi systems, the AI utility for creating NFTs as well as the enhancement yield boost system will be the ideal premise for the next phase. The token’s early-stage price point offers a lucrative entry for investors aiming to capitalize on its upward trajectory. However, as the crypto market directs its focus towards the next altcoin season, Rexas Finance stands out among the leading projects. With the combination of innovation, security, and the increasing rate of usage profile it may become the next Solana-like project. In the dynamic business environment of cryptocurrencies, RXS can become a suitable investment target for those investors who seek high growth rates.

38266127,https://finbold.com/?p=223802,1735476770,"Expert warns Bitcoin’s ‘party is over’, expect a crash to $18,000","As Bitcoin ( BTC ) struggles to reclaim the $100,000 resistance , a market expert is warning that the asset’s momentum above this level might have ended for now, and investors should anticipate a massive crash. Notably, after hitting a record high of over $108,000, Bitcoin has faced sustained sell-offs, leaving the leading digital asset at risk of dropping below $90,000. In this case, BTC has been ‘smacked down’ by psychological resistance at the six-figure spot, triggering what could be the start of a significant correction, according to cryptocurrency analyst MFHoz in an X post on December 28. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/MFHoz The expert acknowledged that Bitcoin briefly surpassed its ascending triangle formation—typically a bullish pattern— that led to an all-time high before sharply reversing. This rejection signals a possible breakdown toward lower price zones, with a projected freefall to the $18,000 to $20,000 region. “Bitcoin got smacked down hard at $100,000—psychological resistance held strong. The party’s over, and the crash is coming. It’s heading straight down to $18,000–$20,000,” the expert said. Key support levels to watch lie around the $60,000 range, but the overall trajectory indicates a potential descent beyond that, possibly mirroring Bitcoin’s steep corrections in past cycles. It’s worth noting that Bitcoin’s inability to reclaim the $100,000 spot has resulted in a series of projections cautioning about a possible sustained price downturn. One of the warnings emanated from legendary trading expert Peter Brandt, who shared a similar bearish outlook in an X post on December 29. According to Brandt, Bitcoin appears to be following the ‘Hump Slump Bump Dump Pump’ pattern. This formation mirrors Bitcoin’s cyclical boom-and-bust tendencies, and the latest price action seems to fit the mold. His analysis shows Bitcoin climbing steadily (the Hump), followed by a correction (the Slump), only to rally into a sharp peak (the Bump). Now, Bitcoin appears to be teetering at the ‘Dump’ phase, with price levels hovering around the $95,000 spot. If this pattern plays out entirely, a key support of around $88,605 is critical to watch. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: Peter Brandt What next for Bitcoin’s price? Despite the current bearish technical sentiment, the long-term outlook suggests Bitcoin is likely destined for more gains, backed by several fundamentals. With Donald Trump’s second presidency upcoming, analysts project Bitcoin could soar higher amid the potential rollout of friendly cryptocurrency regulations. To this end, pseudonymous crypto analyst Thescalpingpro predicts Bitcoin could replicate its early 2024 rally in the first quarter of 2025. In Q1 2024, Bitcoin surged past $60,000 after a strong uptrend from late 2023. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: Thescalpingpro With Q1 2025 approaching, the analyst highlighted similar patterns, suggesting that Bitcoin’s current consolidation could lead to a breakout between $135,000 and $150,000. After initially rallying on Trump’s election, Bitcoin seems poised to end the year on a bearish note as the asset has been battered across the holiday season, witnessing notable capital outflows that also impacted related products such as the spot exchange-traded funds ( ETF ). The outflow’s severity was highlighted by the fact that BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF saw its largest single-day outflow on December 24, with $188.7 million withdrawn. This negative sentiment has persisted despite what can be considered bullish news dominating the sector. For instance, Bitcoin has failed to react to the news that Russia is leveraging the asset to conduct trade amid economic sanctions. However, some analysts believe the current correction is healthy for the markets . Bitcoin price analysis Bitcoin was trading at $94,920 by press time, making modest gains of about 0.33% in the last 24 hours. BTC is down over 2% in the red on the weekly timeframe. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold As things stand, Bitcoin’s chances of pushing further toward the $100,000 level hinge on reclaiming near-term resistance zones such as $95,000 and $97,000. On the other hand, breaching the $92,000 support could spell more trouble for the digital asset, with analysts projecting that falling below this mark could lead to a crash to $60,000.

In a new strategy session, Pal takes a look at Sui against XRP ( SUI /XRP) and suggests that the trading pair is in a long-term ascending channel and has already touched the bottom range, implying that a move to the upper level is now in play. “Another interesting chart that I quite like is XRP [which] has been super strong, but really, what we’ve seen is the upward trend of SUI outperformance. We hit the bottom of the trend channel and we’re likely to outperform XRP going forward again in that ongoing relative outperformance. That’s not to say XRP goes down, I’m just giving you the perspective of these cross-rates to understand the nuance of markets.” Source: Raoul Pal/YouTube The Real Vision CEO says that something similar is happening on the SUI/SOL chart. According to Pal, SUI/SOL has completed an inverse head and shoulders on the weekly chart and is in the midst of confirming a breakout after printing the second shoulder. “The other thing that I look at is I look at the cross rates between various cryptos to try and pick the strongest one. I’ve already shown that Solana is very strong, and to expect it to keep going higher. But when I compare SUI against Solana, it’s starting to break out from this inverse head and shoulders pattern, which suggests to me, that I would switch more assets from Solana into Sui. That’s not saying Solana is going to go down. In fact, I think Solana does extremely well and you should be overweighted there because it is a second cycle, more proven protocol while SUI is newer and riskier. But It looks like the alpha is going to come from the new token, the new performer of SUI.” Source: Raoul Pal/YouTube At time of writing, SUI is trading at $4.18.

Analysts are predicting XRP could reach $10, but RXS’s growth potential has sparked projections of a rise to $17.5. XRP Targets $10 Amid Positive Market Momentum This shows that Ripple’s XRP is still trading at 2.35 USDT having established itself well above the 2.17 USDT support level. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that XRP has risen by 5% in the last 24 hours due to the boosting of the bulls and the whales. Furthermore, data from markets shows that large holders bought more than 80 million XRP since December 17 in a clear show of faith in the currency. According to analysts, the recovery above the 2.60 USDT resistance may open the way for further advance to 3 USDT. However, if the general market conditions continue to be conducive, XRP is highly likely to revisit the 2018 all-time high of $3.55 in terms of the USDT pair. Some of the stock market analysts have also projected that the price of the token could rockets to $10 by 2025 based on moves such as; Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin and possible approval of XRP-based ETFs.

Real-World Asset Tokenization Fuels RXS Growth Rexas Finance has oriented itself toward tokenizing real-world assets, which makes it unique in the sphere of blockchain startups. The platform means it gives the investors the ability to invest in a small portion of the share they want which they could not afford to buy the whole share. This strategy has attracted some interest because of the globalization of markets and the application of Blockchain technology that increases the fluidity of operations. Key tools within the Rexas ecosystem include the Rexas Token Builder, which simplifies asset tokenization, and the Rexas Launchpad, a decentralized platform for funding token projects. The company’s real estate module, Rexas Estate, enables co-ownership of properties, providing passive income to investors. By bridging traditional finance and decentralized solutions, Rexas Finance has positioned itself as a leader in blockchain innovation.

Siqi Chen, CEO of startup finance platform Runway, announced the donation after the charity meme coin, named after his daughter Mira, soared to an all-time high market capitalization of $80 million. Chen’s Pledge The girl’s diagnosis inspired Chen to post a plea on X earlier in the week, asking for donations to support the Hankinson Lab at the University of Colorado, a research facility specializing in rare brain tumors. The post gained widespread attention, prompting a Pump.fun user to create the MIRA token. The cryptocurrency gained immediate traction, reaching an all-time high market capitalization of $80 million. One notable supporter, an X user named Waddles, purchased and transferred 50% of the MIRA supply to Chen, instantly making his stake in the coin worth millions. Waddles shared his motivation on X, explaining that he hoped to rally the Solana community to support a meaningful cause during the holiday season. He also expressed his happiness that things had worked out as they did and hoped that the funds would contribute to finding a cure for those with the condition. In a December 26 update , Chen expressed his gratitude, calling it “the most memorable day on the internet” in his 30 years online. The tech executive then outlined a strategy to liquidate the funds responsibly. He revealed his plans to sell $1,000 worth of MIRA every 10 minutes indefinitely, promising to give 24 hours notice if the schedule changed. “100% of every penny we’ve made from this, across every kitkat/meme coin, including LP fees, will be going directly to rare disease research,” Chen said. Despite some traders profiting from the coin without contributing to charity, he emphasized the initiative’s overall positive impact. Initially aiming to raise $200,000, he confirmed they would exceed this goal significantly, ultimately donating at least $1 million to rare disease research. The Charity Meme Coin Since the announcement, MIRA has declined in value, stabilizing at a market capitalization of approximately $14 million at the time of writing. Another token, “kitkat,” named after the young girl’s dog, briefly reached a $3 million market cap before falling to around $111,000. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin previously highlighted charity-driven meme coins as a “positive-sum” innovation within the meme coin trend. In a March blog post, he expressed optimism that such tokens could evolve into meaningful projects, benefiting the crypto ecosystem and society while challenging the perception that these assets are useless or perpetuate harmful stereotypes.

38265838,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323238,1735476046,Can Bitcoin Hit 13M in 21 Years – Michael Saylor Prediction,"Michael Saylor, a prominent Bitcoin advocate and co-founder of MicroStrategy, has made a headline-grabbing prediction: Bitcoin could reach $13 million per coin by 2045. This bold forecast underscores Bitcoin’s growing significance as a global asset, sparking discussions about its potential to reshape traditional finance and challenge traditional investment models. Speaking in a recent interview with Altcoin Daily, Saylor outlined his rationale, emphasizing Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins, scarcity-driven value, and unparalleled long-term potential. His forecast has ignited debates across the financial and crypto worlds, with many reflecting on Bitcoin’s historical performance and its role as a hedge against economic uncertainty. Saylor’s Vision for Bitcoin in 2045 In his conversation with Altcoin Daily, Saylor described Bitcoin as the “world’s first perfect monetary asset.” Unlike traditional investments like gold, real estate, or stocks, Bitcoin’s supply is capped, creating a level of scarcity that no other asset can replicate. Saylor argues that this scarcity is the foundation of Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. For context, fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar have lost significant purchasing power over the last century. Saylor used this example to highlight Bitcoin’s resilience, especially as global fiat currencies face inflationary pressures. With its finite supply, Bitcoin offers a hedge against these risks, cementing its position as a store of value. This scarcity-driven model, coupled with growing concerns about fiat currency devaluation, strengthens Bitcoin’s position as a hedge against inflation. Unprecedented Growth Potential Saylor’s optimism stems from Bitcoin’s performance over the past decade. Growing at an average annual rate of 60%, Bitcoin has far outpaced traditional benchmarks like the S&P 500, which has averaged 15% annual growth. This extraordinary growth, according to Saylor, could lead to a massive shift in global wealth—estimated at $500 trillion—moving away from traditional assets like equities, bonds, and real estate into Bitcoin. Despite periodic price corrections, Saylor views these fluctuations as part of Bitcoin’s maturation process. A bold forecast, but even if #Bitcoin doesn't hit $13M in 21 years, the key takeaway is its long-term value proposition https://t.co/54RmO2JVWM — Crypto with Ankit (@Cryptowithankit) December 28, 2024 He predicts Bitcoin’s price could climb from $55,000 in 2024 to $13 million by 2045 , with its market capitalization soaring from $2 trillion to $280 trillion. This trajectory implies an annual return of approximately 29% over the next 21 years, a feat unmatched by any traditional asset class. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: BTC Nearing Key Levels Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $94,975, reflecting a 0.44% increase over the past 24 hours, with a trading volume of $22.35 billion. The price remains confined below a key downward trendline resistance at $95,550, which also aligns with the 50-day EMA. A breakout above this level could push Bitcoin toward the next resistance levels at $98,330 and $100,250, marking critical milestones for bullish momentum. On the downside, immediate support is found at $92,150. A breach of this level could confirm a double-bottom breakdown, opening the door for further declines toward $90,404 and $88,761. The RSI sits at 44, indicating neutral-to-bearish momentum and leaving room for short-term price fluctuations. Key Levels to Watch: Resistance Levels: $95,550, $98,330, and $100,250. Support Levels: $92,150, $90,404, and $88,761. Indicators: RSI at 44 reflects neutral momentum; the 50-day EMA acts as resistance at $95,550.

38266801,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53350,1735475455,Skipped Litecoin’s Train to Wealth? Qubetics Is the New Crypto Opportunity You’ve Been Waiting For!,"The cryptocurrency market has had its fair share of legends, and Litecoin is one of them. Known as the “silver to Bitcoin’s gold,” Litecoin made its mark as one of the first altcoins to bring faster transaction times and lower fees to the blockchain space. Those who got in early saw massive returns as Litecoin cemented itself as a staple in the crypto world. But let’s face it—if you’re only hearing about Litecoin’s success now, the boat has already sailed for those early, explosive gains. That’s where Qubetics ($TICS) steps in. As a revolutionary web3 aggregator focused on Real World Asset Tokenisation (RWA), Qubetics is creating a buzz that’s hard to ignore. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy in December 2024, this might just be your second chance at securing life-changing returns. Qubetics ($TICS): Turning Real-World Assets Into Opportunities Qubetics isn’t just another cryptocurrency; it’s a game-changer with real-world applications. Unlike Litecoin, which focuses on being a faster, cheaper alternative to Bitcoin, Qubetics dives into tokenising real-world assets. Imagine turning your property, intellectual property, or even artwork into blockchain-based tokens that can be traded, sold, or invested in globally. That’s the future Qubetics is building. Currently in Presale Phase 14, $TICS tokens are priced at just $0.037. The presale has already raised over $8 million, with more than 382 million tokens sold and a community of over 12,200 holders. What makes this presale even more exciting is the 10% price increase with every phase, culminating in a final-phase price hike of 20%. By the end of the presale, $TICS is projected to hit $0.25—a jaw-dropping 900% ROI for those who get in early. Beyond the numbers, Qubetics is about empowering individuals and businesses. A small business owner can tokenize their equipment to secure funding, or an artist can sell tokenized shares of their digital creations while retaining ownership. This isn’t just another speculative investment—it’s a project designed to make a tangible impact. Litecoin: The First Altcoin Innovator Litecoin has always been about speed and efficiency. Launched in 2011 by Charlie Lee, it was one of the first altcoins to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance. With faster block generation times and a unique hashing algorithm, Litecoin became a go-to option for transactions that needed to be quicker and cheaper. Over the years, Litecoin has earned its place as a reliable and widely adopted cryptocurrency. It’s been used for everything from e-commerce to remittances, proving its value as a digital currency. However, its growth trajectory has matured, and while it remains a solid investment, the kind of exponential gains that early adopters enjoyed are unlikely to repeat. If you’re looking for the next big opportunity—one that combines innovation with ground-floor entry potential—Litecoin’s days of offering those kinds of returns may be behind it. That’s where Qubetics comes in, offering something fresh and even more revolutionary. Real-Life Scenarios: How Qubetics Makes a Difference Qubetics isn’t just about investing in a token—it’s about investing in a future where blockchain technology solves real-world problems. A restaurateur in Chicago could use Qubetics to tokenize their business, raising funds for expansion while keeping ownership intact. A single mother in Texas might tokenize her family’s land to pay for her child’s education. Even a nonprofit in Kenya could tokenize donations, creating transparency and building trust with global donors. These scenarios aren’t just hypothetical—they’re the real-world impact that Qubetics is designed to deliver. By turning tangible assets into digital tokens, Qubetics democratizes access to funding and investment opportunities, empowering people from all walks of life. Conclusion Litecoin paved the way for faster, more efficient transactions in the blockchain space, earning its place as a crypto pioneer. But its days of delivering life-changing gains are largely behind it. For those who missed out on Litecoin’s early success, Qubetics offers a fresh opportunity to be part of something just as revolutionary—and potentially even more impactful. With its focus on Real World Asset Tokenisation, a thriving presale, and unparalleled growth potential, Qubetics is shaping up to be the next big thing in crypto. Don’t let this chance slip through your fingers. Secure your $TICS tokens today and join a project that’s not just changing lives, but also redefining what’s possible in the world of blockchain. The future is here—are you ready to invest in Best Cryptos in 2024 ?

SOL traded at $183 on December 23, 2024, with increasing market pessimism risking a further drop. Attempts to rally have encountered resistance near the $220 price level, pushing the price lower. The decreased buying pressure fueled bearish sentiment, with technical indicators suggesting possible downside risks. On-chain activity also dropped, with Solana’s network revenue plunging by 24% since December 1, highlighting reduced usage and a 35% price drop over the past month. FXGuys dominates Solana with its innovative Trade2Earn program, rewarding all executed trades and boosting user engagement. Unlike Solana’s struggles with resistance levels, reduced revenue, and bearish sentiment, FXGuys offers staking rewards and immense growth potential, increasing investor confidence. Ethereum faces whale sell-offs as FXGuys shines with Trade2Earn Ethereum recently plunged below $3,200. ETH was valued at $3,316 on December 23, 2024, down 15.04% in the past week. The sharp dip is attributed to large-scale sales by ETH whales and the Ethereum Foundation, resulting in massive selling pressure. Whale transactions, including one that transferred 49,910 ETH to Binance , increased panic in the ETH market. Furthermore, the Ethereum Foundation sold 100 ETH at $4,000, maintaining its strategy of selling during market peaks to fund network developments. Analysts say the next strong support has formed at $2,800. If selling pressure continues, more price losses may follow, but stabilization may cause recovery.

38265436,https://coinpedia.org/?p=399484,1735475294,Cardano Price Analysis: Is ADA Preparing for Another Giant Drop in 2025?,"The post Cardano Price Analysis: Is ADA Preparing for Another Giant Drop in 2025? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto markets are heading towards the end of the year, which is expected largely to be bullish. However, the broader market trends and top cryptos like Cardano demonstrate a sluggish trend with fewer possibilities of a bullish rebound. The ADA bulls are trying to validate a decent ascending trend, but the overall trend remains under a bearish influence as the rally is constantly printing lower highs and lows. In such a scenario where the price may close the yearly trade under the crucial resistance, will Cardano reclaim $1 in Q1 2025 & mark new highs? The daily chart of ADA suggests the price is undergoing an inverse v-shape pattern that could drag the levels back to their initial position at around $0.4. The volume has plunged to the ground, suggesting a massive drop in the volatility that could raise serious concerns over the upcoming price action in 2025. In the bull run, over? Will ADA’s price fail to follow the market trend as it did before? The historical chart of the ADA price rally suggests that the token has room to revamp a strong bull run, provided it initiates a strong rebound from the current levels. After failing to rise above the resistance zone between $1.29 and $1.5, the price plunged but is holding above the trend reversal zone between $0.78 and $0.85, acting as a strong support zone. However, the price trades above the bearish zone as it has broken the multi-year descending trend line, which indicates a flip could be fast approaching. The Gaussian channel has turned bullish after being bearish for a couple of months, indicating a momental shift in the trend. Besides, the MACD suggests a drop in the buying pressure and the MACD & signal line are heading for a bearish crossover. Meanwhile, the levels remain within the positive range, suggesting a quick rebound soon after the bearish crossover, keeping the bullish hopes alive. Therefore, the Cardano (ADA) price rally may still go long in 2025 if the token manages to trade above the support zone until the year-end. This could help the price reclaim $1 in the first few days of 2025 and maintain a healthy upswing thereafter.",NEGATIVE,ADA,ADA | ALTCOIN | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/cardano-price-analysis-is-ada-preparing-for-another-giant-drop-in-2025/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
38265347,https://crypto.news/?p=14322989,1735475058,AI predicts this new altcoin to mimic XRP and Solana’s success,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. The crypto market shows volatility, but XRP, Solana, and Rollblock’s GameFi project are set for major gains in 2025. Table of Contents Rollblock poised for 880% gains by changing GameFi industry XRP to record massive rally after RLUSD release Solana expected to surge towards $300 price target Rollblock could replicate SOL and XRP gains in early 2025 The crypto market has seen several fluctuations over the past few weeks but three tokens are showing significant potential for gains in 2025. XRP ’s price is expected to record another wave of its ongoing rally after Ripple launches its highly anticipated stablecoin RLUSD and Solana could retest its recent all-time high price level before surging towards the $200 zone. Meanwhile, Rollblock’s new low cap crypto is making waves with its revolutionary GameFi project that has Ethereum-backed security, AI-powered games and massive staking rewards. You might also like: Rollblock vs Dogecoin vs Cardano: A quest for crypto with higher growth potential in 2025 Rollblock poised for 880% gains by changing GameFi industry Rollblock ’s new GameFi protocol is completely changing the global gambling market which is already valued at $500 billion per annum. Since Rollblock combines the best features of decentralized and centralized gaming on its Web3-based ecosystem, analysts expect Rollblock’s native RBLK token to become the leading DeFi altcoin by early 2025. Since Rollblock is gaining investor confidence with its Ethereum-backed GameFi ecosystem, even ChatGPT is predicting the RBLK token to deliver up to 880% returns to early investors. These bullish predictions are fueled by Rollblock’s massive gaming library that already features 7,000+ AI-powered games that are based on the latest web3 technology. To make things even better, Rollblock’s smart contract has already been audited by SolidProof to always ensure user security and privacy. When users place a bet on any game on Rollblock, their financial information and bet is automatically encrypted on Ethereum’s immutable blockchain. Since it is impossible to alter bets after they have been placed, Rollblock’s GameFi project is offering the most provably fair odds in the entire online gambling market. Aside from incorporating fun and excitement with big gains, Rollblock also has a revenue sharing model that shares up to 30% of the platform’s revenue with long-term token holders. Every week, Rollblock repurchases RBLK at market price and distributes 40% of these as staking rewards with the highest APYs in the market. The remaining 60% of RBLK are burned forever to ensure that the token’s price remains deflationary over time. XRP to record massive rally after RLUSD release XRP’s price has rallied by 48.15% over the last 30 days after it took the entire market by surprise. During the previous rally, XRP broke out of a bullish triangle pattern which had been forming for the last six years. Since XRP’s developer Ripple has just launched a new stablecoin to compete with USDT, analysts expect XRP’s price to rally because of broader ecosystem growth. XRP is currently trading for $2.19. Given XRP’s bullish technical indicators, the 49.15% rise in XRP’s trading volume can be attributed to high buying activity. Since XRP’s all-time high price of $3.30 isn’t too far anymore, even ChatGPT expects XRP to breach this level and test the $4.20 price target in early 2025. Solana expected to surge towards $300 price target Solana has been stuck in a corrective period after reaching a new all-time high price of $264 in November 2024. Solana is currently consolidating within a descending channel below the $198 level but analysts are optimistic about a bullish continuation. According to ChatGPT, Solana needs to break above the $236 resistance to continue its upward momentum toward an even bigger all-time high price point. Solana is currently trading for $194.57. Solana’s RSI has also recovered to the neutral level which means increased buying activity could trigger a massive rally in the next few weeks. Since Solana’s Momentum indicator is already flashing bullish signals, analysts believe Solana could test its R1 resistance at $283.24 in early 2025. Rollblock could replicate SOL and XRP gains in early 2025 While Solana and XRP investors are still guessing on future price movements, Rollblock’s native RBLK token is already poised for a massive 100x rally on its official launch day in early 2025. Since RBLK tokens are currently selling for a low price of just $0.044 each, now could be the ideal time to invest in Rollblock’s GameFi revolution before it replicates Solana and XRP’s explosive price trend.

38270451,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=106806,1735474984,Here’s Dogecoin Price if DOGE Reaches Ethereum or Tether Market Cap,"Dogecoin could surge tremendously to new all-time high targets if DOGE equals the market cap of Ethereum or Tether. Dogecoin investors have remained optimistic about DOGE’s potential despite the asset’s recent underperformance. This confidence is reflected in recent stats shared by leading India-based crypto exchange CoinSwitch. As reported yesterday, CoinSwitch ranked Dogecoin as the most-held token on its platform, with 8% of the exchange’s 20 million users holding the token. Most of these users are anticipating a potential surge for Dogecoin, as observed in the 2020/2021 bull run when DOGE surged by more than 3,000%. Dogecoin Price If It Equals Ethereum or Tether Valuations Amid this speculation, some investors wonder how high Dogecoin's price could reach if it equals the market cap of established cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) and Tether (USDT). For context, Dogecoin’s market cap of $46.4 billion places it as the seventh-biggest cryptocurrency in the world. It is currently priced at $0.3148 per token, reflecting a slight increase of 0.55%. However, the asset has witnessed a double-digit loss of 12.4% in the past seven days. It has a circulating supply of 147,385,346,384 (147.38 billion) tokens in the hours leading up to press time. Dogecoin Price at Ethereum Market Cap At the time of writing, Ethereum ranks as the second-largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $401.28 billion. To reach Ethereum’s market cap, Dogecoin must soar by 764.82% from its current valuation of $46.4 billion. If Dogecoin achieves this feat, its price will rise to $2.7224 per token, assuming DOGE maintains its circulating supply of 147.38 billion tokens. Therefore, if its market cap reaches that of Ethereum, Dogecoin will be worth $2.7224 per token. This will mark a new all-time high (ATH) for the firstborn memecoin, surpassing the previous value of $0.7376 by 269.08%. Price of Dogecoin at Tether Market Cap Tether (USDT) remains the world’s largest stablecoin and the third-biggest cryptocurrency globally. At the time of writing, it has a market cap of $138.76 billion. To hit that cap, Dogecoin will have to soar 199.05% from its current valuation. Should this materialize, Dogecoin will trade at $0.9414, marking a new all-time high for the token. This speculation assumes that Dogecoin’s circulating supply of 147.38 million tokens remains fairly stable. Can Dogecoin Rise to $0.9414 or $2.7224? The possibility of Dogecoin hitting targets like $0.9414 or $2.7224 depends on several factors, including a favorable market condition, increased adoption, and continuous endorsements from notable figures like Elon Musk. Dogecoin has continuously shown that it has the capacity to register jaw-dropping rallies, as seen last month when it soared over 200% in less than a month. In the meantime, top market observers believe Dogecoin could clinch these targets in the next few years. According to experts at Changelly, Dogecoin could trade at a maximum target of $0.9480 by October 2029. Additionally, they expect DOGE’s price to reach $2.77 three years later. Even though this analysis looks enticing, it is imperative to approach crypto investing with caution due to the unpredictable nature of the broader market.",POSITIVE,DOGE | ETH | USDT,DOGE | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/29/heres-dogecoin-price-if-doge-reaches-ethereum-or-tether-market-cap/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heres-dogecoin-price-if-doge-reaches-ethereum-or-tether-market-cap,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

38265837,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323233,1735474650,Solana Still Eyes $200 – After 4.6% Increase Today,"Solana (SOL) has surged 4.6% over the past 24 hours, trading at $196.06, as it inches closer to reclaiming the $200 milestone. This upward momentum has reignited investor interest, fueled by speculation around a proposed Solana Futures ETF and a broader recovery in the cryptocurrency market. With a trading volume of $2.33 billion and a market cap of $94.04 billion, Solana continues to solidify its position as one of the top-performing blockchain networks. Solana Futures ETF: A Game-Changer? Volatility Shares LLC has filed a proposal with the SEC for a Solana Futures ETF, offering leverage options of 1x, 2x, and -1x. If approved, this ETF would allow investors to trade Solana with both upward and downward exposure, providing new ways to profit from price movements. Solana ETF Registration Statement | Source: Volatility Shares The inclusion of a -1x inverse product is particularly noteworthy, enabling investors to hedge against price declines. Volatility Shares has already established itself in the ETF space with Ethereum futures ETFs and hybrid products. This Solana filing, though speculative, signals growing demand for regulated crypto investment products and could set the stage for a spot Solana ETF in the future. Solana Technical Outlook: Momentum Builds Solana’s price has broken out of a symmetrical triangle near $196.10, signaling bullish momentum. Immediate resistance lies at $201.75, and if this level is surpassed, the next targets are $211.55 and $218.86. On the downside, support is found at $193.24, with additional levels at $182.53 and $174.97. The RSI stands at 58.72, reflecting a strong yet balanced upward trend without overbought conditions. The 50-day EMA at $193.24 has transitioned into a support level, reinforcing the breakout’s strength. Broader Market Impact The proposed Solana Futures ETF could have far-reaching implications, attracting institutional interest and legitimizing Solana as an investment-grade asset. Analysts suggest this move could also pave the way for spot ETFs, giving investors direct exposure to Solana’s market performance. This is wild. Solana futures ETF filing bf Solana futures even exist! Oh and let’s do a 2x while we’re. Hard core.. and prob good sign Solana futures on way which arguable bodes well for spot odds. And this was supposed to be a quiet week! https://t.co/YiwauQfaji — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 28, 2024 As the crypto sector evolves, products like the Solana ETF highlight the growing intersection of traditional finance and digital assets. Solana’s robust blockchain infrastructure, known for its speed and low fees, adds to its appeal as a top-tier cryptocurrency poised for further growth. $BEST Wallet Raises Nearly $6M: Limited Time to Buy Best Wallet continues to make waves in the Web3 space, supporting thousands of cryptocurrencies across 50+ major blockchains, including Bitcoin and Ethereum.

According to pseudonymous trader Daan Crypto Trades, the total market capitalization of all altcoins excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum—tracked as TOTAL3—must surpass its 2021 all-time high of $1.13 trillion before true market exuberance can set in. TOTAL3 Must Break 2021 High: Experts As of Dec. 28, TOTAL3 sits at approximately $962.78 billion, reflecting a remarkable 91.45% increase since the start of 2024. However, Daan suggests the market will remain volatile and range-bound between $840 billion and $1.1 trillion until the decisive breakout occurs. Should TOTAL3 dip below $800 billion, Daan warns of potential market caution. This cautious sentiment is shared by other market observers, who note increased volatility due to shorter-term trading behaviors among participants. Syncracy Capital co-founder Daniel Cheung attributes the slower pace of altcoin breakouts to a shift in trading strategies, with many participants now closely monitoring hourly charts and leveraging positions. Altcoin Market Amid Bitcoin Dominance While Bitcoin continues to dominate with nearly 60% market share, its recent price stagnation has prompted traders to consider altcoin market as a more attractive investment opportunity. According to CoinMarketCap, notable gainers among the top 100 cryptocurrencies over the past week include Bitget Token (BGB), which surged 80.65%, Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL), up 42.30%, and Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), with a 31.63% rise. The shift in sentiment has spurred traders like pseudonymous user Dyme to advocate for reallocating focus toward altcoins. “Altcoins, at this juncture, offer a far more optimal risk/reward profile than Bitcoin does,” Dyme noted in a recent X post. They further emphasized that the window for accumulating Bitcoin at favorable levels has likely closed for the foreseeable future. A breach of the 2021 high could ignite a frenzy of activity, signaling the long-awaited “euphoria” phase. Until then, however, the market appears destined for a period of heightened volatility and cautious optimism.

This platform allows strategic investors to access varied assets such as stocks, forex, and ETFs to realize more rewarding investment returns than simply trading cryptocurrencies. Now is the time for wise investors to evaluate this exciting opportunity, given the increasing momentum around the DTX Exchange presale, which is currently selling at an affordable $0.14 per DTX token but is expected to hit $0.16 by the next phase. Revolutionizing Crypto Trading with Integrated Stocks, Forex, and Tokenized ETFs for a Seamless Investment Experience DTX Exchange is a first-mover crypto-native platform that integrates different options for trading all under a single roof. Unlike the conventional exchanges that solely deal with cryptocurrencies, DTX merges stocks, forex, and over 100,000 currency pairs into its system, creating a platform for trading shares and currencies. The idea is to expand investment options and improve user interaction by eliminating multiple platforms. Therefore, the upcoming launch of tokenized ETFs on the DTX Exchange must be followed. These ETFs will target users from countries where trading in conventional ETFs is limited, an idea that opens up a larger market (of customers). Consequently, individual and corporate investors seeking regulated channels to deal with online assets are expected to find such features appealing. DTX is determined to satisfy market needs and attract more clients by integrating this new trading opportunity. DTX has earned an impressive cash flow totaling $10.6 million during an ongoing presale phase. The interest for this is exceptionally high, given that over 300 thousand wallets are now operational. The starting point for the price was $0.02 per token when it was first launched, and it is expected to get to $0.16 in no time. The prospect of a large gain has caused investors to become excited in particular. According to analysts, DTX is expected to have an astonishing 100 times upsurge upon becoming listed at significant cryptocurrency exchanges only after launch. This hope comes from the VulcanX blockchain technology, which has an advanced technology environment that ensures there are no delays during transactions with speeds reaching up to one hundred thousand per second (TPS). This suggests that DTX Exchange can compete with all others within this sector based on its profitability and performance efficiencies. Pioneering User-Centered Innovations with High Leverage, Community-Driven Features, and Enhanced Asset Security What sets DTX Exchange apart from its rivals is a set of user-centered functionalities targeted at increasing security and gains. Users are granted access to trade using up to 1,000x leverage, a move that makes it possible for even small amounts of money to be traded with great ease through them, hence turning a $100 investment into $100,000 trading power. Besides, the DTX token holders who vote can control what new products and functions come up on the site. This fosters engagement with the community and makes sure clients’ opinions matter in the way that the platform will evolve. Large-scale investors can also take advantage of such a program for profit sharing which would give them more reasons to put money into DTX tokens. This means that with its capability to securely hold any kind of assets traded through it, The Phoenix Wallet acts as another form of securing users’ control over their belongings hence enhancing safety standards for DTX. Conclusion On the horizon of 2025, DTX Exchange shines as an innovational beacon in cryptocurrency. With an imminent ETF trading platform launch and an ongoing presale that already boasts of significant investment, there is no better moment than now when one should think about stashing money into some DTXs. The combination of advanced technology, diverse asset offerings, and community-driven governance makes DTX Exchange an intriguing opportunity for new and seasoned investors. With predictions of substantial growth on the horizon and a unique position in the market as a hybrid trading platform, DTX Exchange is poised to participate in and potentially redefine the future of digital asset trading. Investors should act quickly; with the current presale price at just $0.14 before it rises to $0.16 in the next stage, this may be your last chance to buy into what could be one of 2025’s biggest breakout stars—DTX Exchange!

38264692,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=667970,1735473648,Metrics Reveal Cardano Whale Accumulation – Is ADA Poised For A Rally?,"Cardano (ADA) has faced a challenging period, experiencing a sharp 42% correction since early December, when it reached a multi-year high of $1.32. The retracement reflects broader market uncertainties and profit-taking by investors following its impressive rally. However, recent on-chain metrics point to an intriguing shift in market dynamics: a surge in whale accumulation. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Bought Over 90 Million DOGE In 48H – Details Top analyst Ali Martinez highlighted key data revealing that major investors have purchased over 20 million ADA in the past 48 hours. This significant activity adds to an ongoing trend of large-scale accumulation by whales, signaling growing confidence in Cardano’s long-term potential. The renewed interest from big players comes as Cardano continues to expand its ecosystem with robust development initiatives and partnerships. This accumulation phase could mark a turning point for ADA, as whale activity often precedes market recoveries and future price rallies. While the market remains cautious, Cardano’s underlying metrics suggest resilience despite the recent downturn. Investors and analysts are now closely watching these developments to gauge whether this accumulation trend will help ADA regain momentum and climb back toward its previous highs. With whale interest intensifying, Cardano could be gearing up for a notable rebound in the coming weeks. Cardano Whales Keep Buying Cardano’s recent price correction has not deterred long-term investors, particularly whales, who seem to be seizing the opportunity to accumulate. This sharp uptick in accumulation suggests that large-scale investors are positioning themselves for a potential price breakout in the near future. Historically, significant whale activity has often preceded major market moves, and this case appears no different. The accumulation trend highlights growing confidence among influential players in Cardano’s ecosystem, even as the market has seen recent turbulence. Analysts speculate that whales could be anticipating upcoming developments or improvements within the Cardano blockchain that may fuel renewed interest and price growth. This trend aligns with broader market dynamics, where smart money often takes advantage of suppressed prices to establish positions before momentum shifts. As a result, the activity of these large holders is being closely monitored by market participants who view it as a critical indicator of ADA’s potential direction. Related Reading: A 20%-30% Correction Is ‘The Most Bullish Thing’ That Could Happen To Bitcoin – Analyst While short-term fluctuations persist, the underlying metrics paint a bullish picture for Cardano. If whale accumulation continues, it could serve as a catalyst for ADA to reclaim key resistance levels and potentially break out of its prolonged correction phase. ADA Holding Key Levels Cardano is currently trading above the $0.85 support level despite growing selling pressure in recent sessions. This key level has acted as a critical demand zone, preventing further declines and providing a foundation for potential recovery. However, ADA remains at a crossroads, as its next moves could set the tone for its price trajectory in the coming weeks. If Cardano can reclaim the psychologically significant $1 mark with conviction, analysts predict a strong rally could follow. Such a move would likely pave the way for ADA to challenge its yearly high at $1.32, set during its impressive run in early December. Breaking above this resistance could signal a broader market reversal and renew bullish momentum for the cryptocurrency. However, risks still loom on the downside. Failure to hold current support levels could expose ADA to a deeper retracement, potentially revisiting lower demand zones around $0.75. This scenario would reflect increased bearish sentiment, highlighting the ongoing battle between bulls and bears.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Despite Solana’s volatility and Ripple’s impressive recovery, one coin is set to 38x your $350 investment in 54 days. Table of Contents Rexas Finance: The high ROI token The path to a 38x price rally Choosing Rexas Finance over Solana and XRP Conclusion In recent weeks, Solana (SOL) has demonstrated notable volatility. At $192.24 right now, the token has appreciated 5.38% during the past 24 hours, suggesting a temporary rebound. Nonetheless, a 25.04% drop in the last month shows Solana’s volatile price movement on a more significant time scale. Ripple (XRP) has shown an incredible recovery, with its price of about $2.25. XRP is rising by 3.10% over the previous 24 hours, which helps to explain an impressive 55.36% rise over the past month. Though these gains and swings abound, forget SOL and XRP; this coin will 38x your $350 investment into $13300 in 54 days.

Just $0.175 during its presale stage 11, Rexas Finance has shown incredible speed. With almost $33.29 million raised to date and a 6x increase over its presale price, the cryptocurrency shows great investor trust. Analysts say Rexas Finance will provide an amazing 38x return in 54 days, transforming a $350 investment into $13,300. By bridging the digital and physical worlds, Rexas Finance helps consumers effortlessly tokenize real-world assets. Without technological knowledge, its ecosystem lets people and companies build tokenized representations of physical objects, including real estate, art, and goods. Tools like the Rexas Token Builder and the Rexas Launchpad simplify asset tokenization and make it globally accessible. With unmatched utility and scalability, this creative solution makes Rexas Finance a major participant in the fast-expanding real-world asset (RWA) tokenizing industry. The Certik audit of Rexas Finance gives the project a notable degree of credibility and trust. Renowned blockchain security company Certik has a certificate of certification that ensures investors are aware of the dependability and safety of Rexas Finance’s ecosystem. This audit distinguishes Rexas Finance in a market where security issues typically discourage potential investors by confirming its reputation as a reliable and safe platform. Based on its $1 million giveaway program, Rexas Finance has attracted a rapidly expanding following. With around 643,000 entries so far, the campaign is paying 20 winners $50,000 worth of RXS apiece, significantly increasing the token’s awareness and attractiveness. This program emphasizes the project’s kindness and dedication to creating a devoted and involved user base. The path to a 38x price rally Rexas Finance’s unique value proposition, strong ecosystem, and general investor excitement support its exponential development potential. One of the most profitable investment prospects in the present market, analysts estimate the token might cause a 38x price surge in only 54 days. For early adopters, a $350 investment in Rexas Finance, currently at $0.175, may turn into $13,300 in life-changing profits. The coin’s strong presale performance and capacity to meet real-world needs through creative tokenization solutions support this amazing prognosis. Choosing Rexas Finance over Solana and XRP Although Solana and XRP are now somewhat well-known in the crypto scene, their development potential is less than Rexas Finance’s. Solana’s volatile pricing patterns and XRP’s reliance on legal successes make them less consistent investing choices. Driven by its creative approach to real-world asset tokenizing and expanding its community of supporters, Rexas Finance has a clear road map for exponential development. Moreover, Rexas Finance’s reasonable presale price of $0.175 provides a reasonable starting point for investors trying to optimize their gains. Its ability to produce a 38x rise in just 54 days distinguishes it as a high-reward possibility in the current market environment. Conclusion Rexas Finance offers an unmatched opportunity for investors looking to profit from the next big thing in the crypto market. Priced at $0.175 and expected to yield a 38x return in 54 days, the token can turn small investments into enormous riches. Rexas Finance is positioned to challenge the crypto market with its creative approach to real-world asset tokenization, outstanding presale performance, Certik-audited security, and active community involvement.

38264664,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634486,1735473410,Google to shift its focus to Gemini in 2025,"Google is planning to shift its focus to Gemini in 2025, with its CEO Sundar Pichai noting that it will be a “critical” year. According to the CEO, the company is expecting to face increased competition in the face of regulatory hurdles that will pose enough challenges for firms in the industry. He also expects rapid improvements in the artificial intelligence industry going into the new year. According to CNBC , the Google CEO and other top executives talked about plans for the new year, especially what it has in store for the new year. The 2025 strategy meeting was attended by all employees, with some of them attending virtually. According to Pichai, 2025 is a year where the stakes will be high, noting that there will be several disruptive moments in the year. Google CEO discusses plans for Gemini in 2025 Google CEO Sundar Pichai also talked about getting the maximum benefits from the technology, noting that they can use it to solve real user problems. “I think it’s really important we internalize the urgency of this moment and need to move faster as a company. The stakes are high. These are disruptive moments,” he said. Google has dominated the search engine business. However, generative AI has shaken things up, forcing the company to step up in the face of competition. OpenAI started to enjoy adoption in 2022, propelling the company to a $157 billion valuation, thanks to investors like Microsoft. The company also announced in July that it will launch its search engine soon. Google is also stepping up, especially with the launch of its AI model Gemini . The app provides users with many functions, especially access to the company’s chatbot. Pichai sees Gemini as the next big thing, because it is close to the half-billion mark, a milestone that 15 other Google apps have hit in the past. Pichai said Gemini is currently gaining momentum, noting that Google only needs to work hard to close the gap in 2025. “With the Gemini app, there is strong momentum, particularly over the last few months,” he said. “But we have some work to do in 2025 to close the gap and establish a leadership position there as well.” Similarly, he feels all of that will be possible if they can scale the Gemini app to help users in 2025. Pichai wants to focus on making better products During the meeting, Pichai showed the attendees a list of large language models, where Gemini 1.5 led others. The list also included OpenAI’s ChatGPT and others. He mentioned that he expects rivals to challenge them and vice versa. Pichai also said he feels the company will be state-of-the-art, but concedes that they might have to play catch-up at some point. He explained that the company needs to focus on making better products instead of being the first. “In history, you don’t always need to be first but you have to execute well and be the best in class as a product, I think that’s what 2025 is all about,” he said. During the question session, an employee asked about what the company intends to do to rival other platforms in the AI space. Pichai passed the question to DeepMind co-founder Demis Hassabis who said they had plans to turbocharge the Gemini app. He said the market has been warming up to it, noting that they have recorded an influx of users since it launched in February. He also added the products are supposed to evolve over the next two years. Another employee asked how the company intends to scale its AI products without charging consumers $200 a month like other platforms. Hassabis said the company is not prepared to charge extravagantly for subscriptions, noting that a $20 per month charge will be good value if consumers intend to use the Gemini service. However, he said that there are no plans for that yet.

38265201,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53378,1735473044,Top 3 Coins You Should Monitor Closely If You Like Dogecoin (DOGE),"With its humorous origins, community-driven expansion, and ability to carve out a niche in the cryptocurrency market, Dogecoin (DOGE) has captivated the crypto space. Many other coins are becoming popular for those who value DOGE’s appeal and possibilities, as they combine community spirit with different uses. Among them are must-watch tokens Rexas Finance (RXS), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE), which offer creativity, interaction, and the chance for big rewards. Rising Star: Rexas Finance (RXS). One innovative concept that combines accessibility and creativity is Rexas Finance. Unlike many meme-based coins, Rexas Finance focuses on Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization, offering actual value. By allowing fractional ownership of classic assets, including real estate, commodities, and collectibles, Rexas Finance democratizes investment possibilities and closes the distance between blockchain and traditional finance. Priced at $0.15 now in Stage 10 of its presale, RXS is likely to rise to $0.175 in the next stage. Rexas Finance has now raised an amazing $32,811,794 after 99.45% of the presale aim was met, and over 377 million tokens were sold. The success of the presale shows how strongly investors believe the idea has a bright future.Thanks to important characteristics such as the Rexas Token Builder for asset tokenization, the Rexas Launchpad for safe fundraising, and Rexas GenAI for AI-driven NFT creation, Rexas Finance is more than simply another cryptocurrency initiative. Among DOGE-inspired investors, RXS distinguishes itself with its large ecosystem and CertiK-audited security, which guarantees its position for long-term development. Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Expanding Ecosystem Meme Coin Shiba Inu has demonstrated qualities beyond mere DOGE competition. Priced around $0.00002109, SHIB is still a reasonable choice for anyone looking to join its growing ecosystem. Often called the “Shib Army,” the Shiba Inu community has driven the token’s appeal. Beyond its comic beginnings, SHIB has grown more valuable with tools like ShibaSwap, which allows for decentralized trading and staking. Moreover, the project’s periodical token burning is meant to raise scarcity and long-term value. Although SHIB’s enormous 589 trillion token circulating count seems daunting, its low price allows investors to gather large quantities, which attracts individuals motivated by DOGE’s community-driven approach. SHIB has great potential for expansion even as it develops its ecosystem. Pepe (PEPE), The Recently Popular Meme Pepe has become quickly known as a powerful meme coin because of its entertaining branding and general community acceptance. With a market value of $7.28 billion and trading at $0.00001731, PEPE is a reasonably priced and attractive substitute for investors seeking high growth potential. Pepe stands out for its active community and dedication to remaining culturally relevant in the meme coin market. Its meme coin roots are evident in its huge 420 trillion token circulation; nonetheless, its strong market activity and liquidity are demonstrated by its active trading volume of more than $2.24 billion. Although buzz and community still primarily drive PEPE, its market momentum and rising popularity make it a coin worth monitoring. PEPE will most likely appeal to investors enthralled by DOGE’s lively character in their portfolio. Why You Should Pay Attention to These Coins These three coins—Rexas Finance (RXS), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE)—offer different advantages for Dogecoin fans while preserving the community-driven energy that made DOGE popular. With its innovative real-world application and presale momentum, Rexas Finance distinguishes itself from other companies. It provides investors with a steady growth path supported by a strong ecosystem. As Shiba Inu’s ecosystem and community support continue to expand, it is positioned as a long-term rival in the cryptocurrency space. Though younger, Pepe positions itself in the meme coin market using its cultural appeal and great trading activity. Each token has unique qualities that fit the Dogecoin philosophy and offer a range of possible developments. Whether you are interested in meme culture, strong communities, or resilient ecosystems, these three currencies should be on your radar. Conclusion Finding tokens that balance community energy with utility becomes increasingly important as the cryptocurrency market develops. Combining unique use cases with the meme-driven appeal that has lately attracted the market, Rexas Finance, Shiba Inu, and Pepe create a triple threat. These three coins are worth monitoring for individuals who love DOGE and are searching for the next great opportunity.

He is pushing for a significant change to a membership-based organization (MBO) to address ongoing challenges within the ecosystem. Hoskinson’s main issue with the foundation is its non-membership governance model , which he claims undermines community participation and oversight. This lack of community involvement, according to him, has created tensions and hindered the blockchain's growth. On December 28, he reiterated these concerns, suggesting an MBO would give users more control over decision-making and solve long-standing issues like social coordination, advocacy for developers, liquidity , and exchange listings. He believes a transition to an MBO would bring practical benefits, such as better oversight of payments and creating a unified entity for development contracts. “The organization should be an MBO. It would solve so many issues people have been complaining about for years,” Hoskinson stated. Earlier this month, he also urged the foundation to move to a jurisdiction where community members could elect its board, opposing the current model in which the Swiss government appoints board members, excluding the Cardano community. Hoskinson’s frustrations extend to resource management. He has highlighted Intersect, a community-led initiative, as a promising alternative but noted its limited funding and reliance on volunteers . Unlike the foundation, which has significant resources, Intersect faces an uphill battle to meet community expectations. Additionally, Hoskinson criticized the foundation for launching Pragma, another entity, instead of supporting Intersect or other community initiatives. He emphasized that the foundation should prioritize empowering existing community-led projects rather than creating competing organizations. This dispute adds to a series of disagreements between Hoskinson and the foundation, including budget allocation and differing opinions on the newly proposed Cardano constitution. While the foundation has expressed support for the constitution, it has hesitated to approve budgets, citing a need for detailed reviews. Hoskinson remains firm that an MBO is essential for the ecosystem's long-term success . He stated that if the foundation cannot adopt this model, it should at least refrain from obstructing community-driven efforts to create one. “If they don’t want to do that, then at least don’t get in the way of Intersect and the budget for the community to build one themselves,” he concluded.",NEGATIVE,없음,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/charles-hoskinson-pushes-for-community-control-in-cardano-governance-shake-up,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/38264269.jpeg

38264057,https://coinpedia.org/?p=399475,1735472269,XRP Price Poised for 100x Rally: Peter Brandt Highlights Bullish Wedge Pattern,"The post XRP Price Poised for 100x Rally: Peter Brandt Highlights Bullish Wedge Pattern appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Veteran trader Peter Brandt, in a recent X post has shared two charts that may hint at XRP’s next potential moves. Notably, Brandt shared a weekly chart that shows a bullish wedge pattern. If validated, the pattern will show price growth into 2025. However, the daily chart suggests a correction from the local top level of $2.728000. Here are two views of $XRPUSD a weekly chart and a daily chart Strong opinions, weakly held A chart is not an opinion and an opinion is not necessarily a position – this is a concept hard to understand by rookies pic.twitter.com/SvaT5hojLW — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 27, 2024 Previously, Peter Brandt had shared that the XRP/USD pair currently seems to be forming a Half Mast Flag. If this pattern completes, Brandt had suggested that the “distance to upside should equal advance into tip of flag.” He noted that that the potential upside could match the previous advance into the tip of the flag, as is typical for this formation. While it often signals a significant price move after a drop, it does not always ensure upward momentum. Credible Crypto’s Bullish Insights Recently, Credible Crypto, a crypto analyst and trader in a latest Youtube video shared that XRP has one of the most bullish market structures in crypto based on the charts. XRP is one of the few coins right now that is printing a very clear bullish impulsive structure on lower time frames, on higher time frames, on every time frame. And very easily cleanly identifiable,” he noted. “That’s kind of what we’re seeing here on XRP – is that very clean price action that shows impulsive price movement,” he added further. The analyst regularly applies the Elliott Wave theory in his technical analysis, and has noted that XRP could explode by up to 1,295% from the current level. Notably, in technical analysis, the Elliott Wave theory suggests that a bullish asset witnesses a five-wave rally before a correction occurs in a three-wave pattern. Credible believes that XRP is preparing for an upward impulse, potentially reaching $4+ and new all-time highs. He suggests this could be part of a larger third-wave move that may ultimately push XRP to $5+. As the final fifth wave progresses, Credible anticipates XRP could reach a blow-off top of $20 to $30. XRP To Hit Double Digits? “By the time we’re gearing up for this final fifth wave, I would imagine that we would have hit double digits at that point. And this fifth wave will take us to the blow-off top or the final top of $20 to $30,” he noted. Notably, XRP witnessed a notable rally in December as it reached a peak of $2.72 on December 3. However, the XRP price has declined steadily due to increased volatility this holiday season. While a brief rally followed the launch of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin but it was not enough to take XRP to newer heights. XRP is currently 36.3% below its all-time high from early 2018, failing to set a new record in December despite earlier momentum. Nevertheless, the fully diluted valuation (FDV) has climbed to $216.24 billion, reinforcing confidence in XRP’s long-term potential.",POSITIVE,XRP,ALTCOIN | MARKET | TRADING | XRP | ZRX,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-poised-for-100x-rally-peter-brandt-highlights-bullish-wedge-pattern/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

The Latin American nation’s buy of an additional 1 BTC on Dec. 29, its total reserves have risen to 6,000.77 BTC, worth $569.3 million. Its listing now joins the roster of top Bitcoin-holding countries such as the United States, China, the United Kingdom, Ukraine, and Bhutan. Great Returns on Investment El Salvador’s Bitcoin journey began in September 2021, when it became the first country to adopt BTC as legal tender. Its first purchase of 200 BTC at the time set the stage for a series of consistent investments under President Nayib Bukele’s administration. To date, the country has seen an impressive 108.02% return on its Bitcoin holdings, with an average acquisition cost of $45,450 per BTC. IMF Deal Spurs Faster Buying If the continued tension with the International Monetary Fund over its Bitcoin policies is any indication, it would appear that El Salvador has continued to double down on its crypto strategy. A $1.4 billion financing agreement with the IMF didn’t stop the country from buying $1 million worth of BTC on one day. The government could accelerate its rate of Bitcoin purchases going forward. Chivo Wallet to Be Retired El Salvador’s Chivo wallet, launched as a government-backed cryptocurrency wallet, is reportedly going to be either sold or phased out, said Herbert. Private sector wallets are expected to fill the gap, which will continue to provide support for BTC transactions in the country. Challenges Ahead and Opportunities While important, the IMF deal is not final and marks the end of four years of hard-won negotiations. The IMF has cautioned that Bitcoin is a risk to El Salvador’s financial stability and has leaned on the country to scale back its crypto ambitions. But El Salvador remains all-in on its BTC game, believing the cryptocurrency a core asset in its future finances.

38263959,https://coinpedia.org/?p=399472,1735472005,XRP News: Open Interest Drops $1B as Price Struggles to Break Resistance,"The post XRP News: Open Interest Drops $1B as Price Struggles to Break Resistance appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP has been consolidating under key resistance for over a month. This has left investors frustrated as the altcoin struggles to gain upward momentum. This extended inactivity has taken a toll on traders’ confidence, with many stepping back as the altcoin has failed to display significant price growth. XRP Open Interest Drops By $1B Recently, the Open Interest in XRP Futures dropped by a massive $1 billion in the past 24 hours. Just a day before, the Open Interest had surged to $2.9 billion over expectations of a rally. However, as the expectations of an imminent rally faded away, traders began withdrawing their funds. This sudden withdrawal reflects the growing bearish sentiment among the XRP enthusiasts. Also, the declining Open Interest depicts the growing uncertainty over XRP’s ability to break through its current resistance levels. Adding to these concerns, is XRP’s macro momentum as well which is showing signs of weakness. XRP To Remain Stagnant? The Price DAA Divergence is currently flashing a sell signal, indicating declining participation and stagnant price movements. This bearish indicator suggests that traders may begin to secure profits, which could lead to further drawdown in the price. The reduced participation from the investors could hold obstruct the altcoin’s recovery, keeping it stuck in a consolidation phase until stronger market signals emerge. While XRP’s price has dropped by 20% over the past month, but it has managed to hold above the $2.00 support level. However, it still remains under the crucial resistance level of $2.73. XRP could continue declining and could risk losing its $2.00 support level if the bearish factors continue to exist. This could further weaken investor confidence and add to the selling pressure aggravting the situation. Analysts Bullish On XRP On the contrary, if the broader market conditions appear bullish, XRP could breach the $2.73 resistance and aim for its all-time high of $3.31. Analysts are bullish on XRP’s future as recently, analyst Dark Defender took to X to share that XRP is currently in a correction phase, similar to a 4-hour time frame, which is expected to complete within ±10 days on the daily chart. He noted that a bull flag pattern was identified on the weekly chart in early December, with a target of $8.67. However, the analyst notes that before reaching this target, XRP must complete its correction. He quotes the support levels to be $2.03, $2.11, $2.13, and $2.17, while resistance levels are $2.22, $2.42, and $2.69. The analyst believes that XRP is expected to continue targets very soon after completing the correction.

This shows a steady increase in sustainable energy adoption since April 2021. Woocharts calculates this metric using the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance's definition of sustainability and takes into account energy sources such as wind, solar, hydro, and nuclear power. Exceeding 50% clean energy usage is a milestone. Tesla, which has 11,509 BTC as of the third quarter of 2024, first adopted Bitcoin as a payment method after purchasing $1.5 billion worth of the cryptocurrency in 2021. However, the company later suspended Bitcoin payments, citing concerns about the cryptocurrency’s high energy consumption. Related News: Former CFTC Chairman Chris Giancarlo Speaks About Bitcoin and Ethereum Tesla CEO Elon Musk has stated that the company will reconsider Bitcoin payments if mining operations reach around 50% clean energy usage: “Tesla only sold ~10% of assets to confirm that BTC can be easily liquidated without moving the market.

From Toncoin’s resilience amid bearish momentum to Sui’s remarkable recent growth and innovative ideas of Remittix in the $190 trillion cross-border payments industry, each of these initiatives is creating waves. Which of these top crypto coins, though, is most likely to see an exponential increase in 2025? Promising technical signs, positive community attitude, and game-changing ideas all point to large possible rewards. Read on to learn why these top crypto coins might be the next big thing and what distinguishes every one of them from the others. Toncoin (TON): A Strong Contender Among Top Altcoins for 2025 Though it has been consolidating between $5.14 and $6.14, the Toncoin price has demonstrated a clear rise over the past week of more than 7%. This Toncoin price movement points to a time of stability within the oscillations of the larger market. On a monthly analysis of the Toncoin price chart, nevertheless, a bearish trend shows as the value of the altcoin dropped by more than 10% last month. Notwithstanding these swings, the Toncoin community’s general attitude is still quite positive since many investors see great future possibilities for the altcoin. Renowned analyst Ali has underlined that Toncoin could be about to have a notable comeback given the present funding rates, hence it is one of the promising altcoins to watch. The Toncoin price chart technically is giving conflicting indications. TradingView reports that although the Momentum Oscillator suggests a cautious view with sale indications, both the MACD and Moving Averages point to purchase signals . For investors seeking long-term gains, Toncoin is still among the top altcoins to hold even if it is about 30% away from its all-time high (ATH) of $8.24. Bullish Sentiment Builds For Sui (SUI) Amid Consolidation The Sui price had a notable drop of more than 9% over the past week, having shown notable consolidation between $4.94 and $4.05. After the Sui coin hit a new all-time high (ATH) on December 16, 2024, investor attention stayed strong despite this brief retreat. But as bearish market pressure has pulled down the Sui price from that top by almost 16%, some holders are already buying the dips. Meanwhile, the Sui price chart for the past month presents a far more optimistic picture with a strong trend with an amazing 20% growth in value. Notwithstanding these swings, the general attitude of the community about the Sui coin is still very bullish. Technically, the Sui price chart is pointing to possible investing prospects. Both the Momentum Oscillator and Moving Averages show purchase signs , implying further rallies for the altcoin. With its recent performance and bullish sentiment, Sui is fast rising among the promising altcoins to watch. Analyst Mags has also shown optimism, saying SUI might rally to a minimum of $40 in this cycle.

Remittix is positioned to lead the fast-growing PayFi market with its emphasis on enhancing the speed and simplicity of international transactions, making it the best crypto investment of the year. Remittix (RTX) Is Set To Outpace Toncoin (TON) and Sui (SUI) Although Toncoin (TON) and Sui (SUI) have great promise in 2025, Remittix (RTX) is the best crypto investment choice for smart investors wishing to profit in the direction of cross-border transactions.

Notably, its price has shot up 1,882% since trading at lows of $0.02381 on November 19, 2024. Given predictions for cryptocurrencies in the coming months, with AI agent tokens a hot trend, AIXBT could target a new all-time high. The token just reached the ATH of $0.48 and the next target will be $1. But could iDEGEN outpace this Virtuals Protocol ecosystem token? iDEGEN price prediction iDEGEN is another AI agent token that has created waves since its launch in late Nov. The unique aspect of this project is its design that allowed a blank slate AI to get degen-trained, completely without the guardrails that have encumbered other AI agents and traditional AI-powered crypto. iDEGEN thus owes everything it has learned and posts every 60 minutes to degen knowledge on X. Integration with Telegram has only fuelled interest, with the token IDGN attracting the broader crypto investor community. Keen to exploit the dynamic pricing model, early buyers have poured over $10 million into the iDEGEN presale. As noted, price follows a dynamic pricing model. In this case, it rises or falls depending on what happens in a five-minute interval. It’s what has pushed IDGN’s price up by 277% in the past week and a staggering 101,700% since its debut just over a month ago. The current price is $0.118 – likely a bargain if AI agents go parabolic. Presale market data shows traders have scooped over 1.12 billion IDGN so far. With listing on crypto exchange platforms coming on January 1, the price level to watch may be the coveted $1. Learn more about iDEGEN or how to buy the AI agent token here .

The market capitalization for meme-based tokens started the month strong at $120.14 billion and surged to a peak of $137.06 billion on December 9. However, a sharp downturn followed, with the total valuation plummeting to $92.67 billion by December 23—a staggering 32.38% decline. Roller Coaster for Memecoins By late December, the market had only slightly recovered, standing at $98.42 billion, which marked an 18% drop from its position at the start of the month. This volatility highlighted a slowdown in momentum for memecoins, despite pockets of investor enthusiasm. Among the key players, Pepe stood out with its erratic performance. Once valued at $0.000026 on December 9, the token saw its price tumble to $0.000017 by December 20. While the token experienced significant gains earlier in the year, its December dip mirrored the larger trend affecting the memecoin ecosystem. The Rise of Pepe and Traders’ Windfalls Despite December’s market contraction, meme tokens like Pepe had their moments of glory. The third-largest memecoin by market capitalization received a boost from high-profile exchange listings, including Binance.US and Coinbase, which spurred temporary rallies. Notably, Binance.US added the token to its offerings on December 4, sending PEPE’s market cap soaring to over $11 billion and briefly outpacing Uniswap’s market cap. This surge provided lucrative opportunities for traders who bet early on Pepe. In one remarkable case from April, an investor turned a $3,000 purchase into a jaw-dropping $46 million in just one month, reflecting Pepe’s meteoric rise. December also saw the reawakening of a dormant wallet holding Pepe. The trader, who had invested a mere $27 in the token over 600 days ago, transferred approximately $52 million worth of Pepe tokens to a new address. This transaction represented an astonishing 1.9 million-fold return on investment, underscoring the high-stakes potential of the memecoin market. As the memecoin craze cools, analysts speculate that the sharp fluctuations in demand and market cap may deter cautious investors while continuing to attract those seeking quick, high-risk rewards. Whether memecoins regain their momentum in the new year remains an open question.

38263150,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634461,1735470000,"Can Lightchain AI Achieve 100x Growth? As TON & PEPE Coin Price Dwindles, Analysts Say Likely","As Toncoin (TON) and PEPE coin prices continue to dwindle, market analysts are turning their attention to Lightchain AI , a blockchain platform merging artificial intelligence with decentralized innovation. With features like the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), Lightchain AI is redefining scalability, privacy, and decentralized governance. Analysts believe the platform’s groundbreaking technology, coupled with the momentum of its Lightchain AI Presale , positions it for potential 100x growth. As traditional meme coins lose steam, Lightchain AI is emerging as a top contender for exponential market success. The Case for Lightchain AI- Catalysts for 100x Growth Lightchain AI is set for big growth as experts see up to 100 times returns by 2025. Its new Proof of Intelligence (PoI) way gives rewards ͏to nodes for doing AI work, which makes the network safer and better. The Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) helps run AI jobs on the blockchain easily, drawing in builders to make smart decentralized apps. At this time, LCAI is in the presale stage, giving tokens at $0.004 which has caught a lot of eye from investors. The plan for the project includes a testnet drop in January 2025, then a mainnet start in March 2025 aiming for full use of PoI and AIVM. With uses in health care, money matters, and shipping, Lightchain AI deals with real issues, making it a big change-maker in the blockchain area. Its green design and shared control make it more appealing to eco-friendly investors and builders. As more people use it across various fields, LCAI could turn into a leading asset for long-term money put down. Challenges for TON and PEPE Coin- A Dwindling Momentum Toncoin (TON) and Pepe Coin (PEPE) have recently faced significant challenges, leading to declining momentum in their markets. Toncoin’s price has been under pressure due to a substantial drop in its burn rate, which fell by 85% from September to December 2024. This decrease has led to increased inflation, with the annual rate rising to 0.31%, the highest since August. Additionally, the Total Value Locked (TVL) in Toncoin’s DeFi protocols has declined from $760 million to $275 million, indicating reduced investor confidence. Pepe Coin has also experienced a downturn, with its price dropping by 16.14% over a recent seven-day period. This decline is attributed to waning investor interest and the inherent volatility of meme-based cryptocurrencies. The lack of substantial utility and increasing competition from emerging tokens have further contributed to PEPE’s diminishing appeal. These factors highlight the challenges both TON and PEPE face in maintaining market momentum amid evolving investor sentiments and market dynamics. Why Lightchain AI Could Outpace the Competition Lightchain AI is rapidly emerging as a formidable contender in the cryptocurrency arena, poised to outpace established players like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe Coin (PEPE). Its innovative integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology offers tangible utility beyond the meme-driven appeal of its competitors. Key Features Proof of Intelligence (PoI) is an innovative consensus mechanism designed to reward nodes for performing valuable AI computations, such as model training and optimization, which enhances both network security and scalability. Additionally, the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) serves as a dedicated computational layer optimized specifically for AI tasks. It supports real-time applications and ensures interoperability with popular AI frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. Tokenomics The total supply of LCAI tokens is capped at 10 billion. Of this, 40% (4 billion LCAI) is allocated for presale, providing early supporters an opportunity to fund platform development. Additionally, 5% (500 million LCAI) is reserved for marketing and partnerships to promote the platform and build strategic alliances. The treasury holds 6.5% (650 million LCAI) for future development and community initiatives, while 5% (500 million LCAI) is allocated to the core team with vesting schedules in place to ensure long-term commitment. Roadmap Phase 1 focuses on prototype development, including the creation of PoI and AIVM, establishing a governance framework, and launching community engagement initiatives. In Phase 2, the testnet is deployed, performance is optimized, and feedback from early users is integrated to refine the system. Finally, Phase 3 marks the mainnet launch, with full activation of PoI and AIVM, onboarding of validator and contributor nodes, and the expansion of partnerships to drive ecosystem growth. Analysts are optimistic about Lightchain AI’s potential, citing its technological advancements and strategic roadmap as catalysts for significant growth, potentially achease in value. In contrast, tokens like TON and PEPE have experienced price declines, prompting investors to seek more robust and utility-driven projects like Lightchain AI. By focusing on real-world applications and sustainable ecosystem development, Lightchain AI is well-positioned to surpass its competition and deliver substantial returns to its investors.

38262416,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634438,1735468586,Crypto.com refuses to fund user’s XRP wallet citing EU’s new rule,"Crypto.com has reportedly started enforcing the European Union’s Travel Rule, blocking a user from making an XRP deposit. The EU rule, Regulation (EU) 2023/1113, which is also known as the Travel Rule is expected to take effect across the continent from December 30. The Travel Rule was introduced as one of the broader strategies to check incidents of money laundering and keep industry participants safe. The regulation also promotes transparency by mandating crypto exchanges collect information from transactions. Users are expected to provide details such as the names of users involved in transfers and the origin and destination of funds. However, users were taken aback when a user cried out that Crypto.com had already begun enforcing the rule before the deadline. The development has also forced users to question privacy and user rights concerns. Crypto.com enforces Travel Rule restrictions early According to reports, Crypto.com kicked off the rule, at least regarding XRP transfers. Alpha Lions Academy CEO Edoardo Farina shared the development in an X post. The prominent crypto personality noted that users are now required to provide additional information regarding their transactions before XRP is credited to their account. NOT YOUR KEYS, NOT YOUR CRYPTO 🚨 Europe’s “Travel Rule” for crypto exchanges takes effect on December 30, 2024, but @cryptocom is already taking action. They’re now refusing to credit $XRP deposits unless you provide: 1️⃣ The beneficiary’s name 2️⃣ The origin of the funds pic.twitter.com/FT3tTaYFsG — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) December 27, 2024 Farina highlighted that the development is frustrating, noting that the rule was supposed to take effect on December 31. “Despite the ‘Travel Rule’ not taking effect until December 30, Crypto.com refused to credit my funds automatically,” Farina said. He also asked why the requirements were necessary since he carried out the transactions in his home country, noting that it was only mandatory for cross-border transactions. The crypto personality’s comments are in line with several practices of some centralized exchanges regarding rules and regulations. While some of them carry out enforcement prematurely, others overreach their enforcement. One instance came when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) first initiated its lawsuit against Ripple and ordered platforms to delist the token. While some waited for users to sell their holdings for other tokens, others delisted the tokens ahead of schedule, leaving users out to dry. Broader criticisms face centralized exchanges Criticisms and controversies of this nature have trailed centralized exchanges in the broader crypto market. A recent one was Coinbase was criticized by the crypto community for blocking and restricting users’ accounts without prior warnings. Although the exchange reserved the right to carry out such actions without notice, the restrictions targeted most of their earliest users, prompting concerns. With centralized exchanges conforming to compliance measures set out by regulators, there has been an argument over their actions in relation to those of their decentralized counterparts. Users argue that decentralized exchange activities align with the ethos of what the crypto industry stands for, while others feel it provides the perfect breeding ground for illegal activities. Crypto.com’s early implementation of the EU’s Travel Rule also shows the increased oversight of regulators in the crypto industry. While the changes are only implemented in the EU, it is only a matter of time before they are implemented worldwide. With the official implementation days away, there will be debates arguing for and against enforcement. Meanwhile, the United States is set to enjoy a booming crypto industry, thanks to the emergence of Donald Trump as the president in its recent election. After years of struggling with regulatory issues, the crypto market in the United States is set to shine. Analysts already expect the United States to take the lead in the global crypto market, a move that Trump said he wants to facilitate.

With several years of operation behind them, landmark wins against SEC regulators in US court, and even Wall Street ETFs for two of them, the crypto assets on this list are less risky for investors than ever before. That doesn’t mean buying these digital assets is without risk any more than buying stocks like Apple or Amazon is without risk. But gone are the days when educated investors must scratch their heads looking at the staggering reports about these currencies’ price gains and wonder if it could be real. They’re currently caught up in the bullish part of a multi-year boom and bust cycle. That means their exchange rates against the dollar have been rising for months and could continue to increase until all market demand has been exhausted. Then, prices are likely to correct again for the remainder of this market cycle. Four Big Cryptos That Beat Wall Street Below is each asset, with a note about how it beat returns from tech stocks in the Nasdaq Composite this year. For reference, the NASDAQ, a broad benchmark for the performance of US tech stocks, gained 33% for the year ending Thursday, Dec. 26. Meanwhile, the four cryptocurrencies featured here gained accordingly: Bitcoin: 126% Ethereum: 49% Solana: 75% Ripple: 247% Over its history, the Nasdaq has taken as long as ten years or more to return this kind of gains to the market value of its stocks. These crypto assets did it in just one year, and it’s by far not the first time they’ve performed this well in a year. 1. Bitcoin (BTC) Yearly Performance 2024: +126% Bitcoin is the original and first-in-class cryptocurrency. It invented the entire segment with its 2009 debut. On Thursday, the Bitcoin economy’s total market capitalization exceeded $1.9 trillion. For the year through Dec. 26, Bitcoin rose 126% over its average Jan. 1 price on crypto exchanges. It is the most traded and most liquid cryptocurrency, as well as the most established, with a hands-off approach by US regulators and several ETF (exchange-traded fund) products available on Wall Street for regulated investors to buy at less risk than using crypto exchanges or self-custody to purchase and secure. In addition to its ongoing unique value proposition, Bitcoin beat the Nasdaq this year for three more proximate reasons: The Wall Street ETF approval for Bitcoin by the SEC on Jan. 10 The four-year BTC supply halving on Apr. 20 The reelection of former President Donald Trump on Nov. 5 Bitcoin’s unique value proposition is its highly secure maintenance of a preciously scarce supply of unique, serialized digital notes on its network. Economists who understand how it works compare Bitcoin to digital gold, which you can send to anyone in the world as easy as it is to send an email. 2. Ethereum (ETH) Yearly Performance 2024: +49% Inspired by the ideas and design behind Bitcoin, Ethereum was the first blockchain smart contract platform to scale to a mass market of users. Smart contracts are like currency on Bitcoin’s network, but they can do more than basic accounting. The idea is powerful, and the possibilities are endless: Smart contracts or decentralized finance (DeFi) networks like Ethereum host programmable money. Imagine you could write a note on a $100 dollar bill that says the first person to meet the requirements on this note gets to have the $100 dollar bill. Furthermore, you could just leave that note posted on a cork board in an office park, and it wouldn’t go anywhere until someone actually did whatever the note requires (for example, leave a note in its place with the solution to a complex problem that would cost you more than $100 to solve yourself). This technology is still new, but it promises to revolutionize finance, law, accounting, insurance, and supply chain management in some way that is comparable to how the Internet revolutionized publishing and retail commerce. Ethereum beat the Nasdaq this year because of: The Wall Street ETF approval for Ether by the SEC on Jul. 22. The Federal Reserve’s pivot to cutting interest rates lower on Sept. 18 The reelection of former President Donald Trump on Nov. 5 Blockchain insights and analytics team CryptoQuant recently noted that key metrics for Ethereum presage a persistently bullish market outlook for ETH tokens for the time being. 3. Solana (SOL) Yearly Performance 2024: +75% Inspired by the success of Ethereum, Solana is another smart contract DeFi platform built with a second-mover advantage of greater network speed and lower fees. While Ether remains the leading DeFi cryptocurrency by market cap, Solana has made enormous strides to close the gap. It still has a ways to go, with some $90 billion in market capitalization Thursday compared to Ethereum’s $400 billion market cap. But cryptocurrency market watchers are eyeing these two closely to gauge the future of the blockchain economy and crypto exchange markets. Solana lagged Bitcoin for ROI growth this year over Jan. 1’s average crypto exchange price, but it bested Ethereum by a pretty margin. Furthermore, it clobbered one of the best years for growth in Nasdaq, with 33% gains for the year ending Thursday, Dec. 26. Solana beat the Nasdaq this year because of: High network throughput and low fees compared to DeFi competitors The Federal Reserve’s pivot to low interest rates and Trump’s reelection The outstanding success of Solana meme coins against its competitors Some of the top Solana memes that stood out this year include Bonk, Pudgy Penguins, Dogwifhat, Fartcoin, Popcat, Gigachad, Goatseus Maximus, and Baby Doge Coin. But beginning crypto investors who don’t know their way around memes are probably safer with the base layer SOL tokens. 4. Ripple (XRP) Yearly Performance 2024: +247% One of the earliest altcoins inspired by Bitcoin, Ripple’s XRP is a decentralized, automated platform for large cross-border payments between financial institutions. Ripple’s XRP tokens are the leading earner on this short list for the year because of pent-up demand as the market is hopeful for a resolution to the SEC lawsuit. The US Securities and Exchange Commission sued Ripple over allegations of selling unregistered securities (those being the XRP tokens for its decentralized payment network). Three US court rulings in Ripple’s favor last year and another this most recent November set the stage for XRP’s over-indexing performance among leading cryptos this year. Ripple beat the Nasdaq because of: Several decisive wins against the SEC in court and hype around potential resolution The Fed’s low rate pivot and Donald Trump’s reelection Ripple’s aggressive push for business partnerships around the world Recent technical analysis of XRP’s price indicates the bull run will continue as long as average exchange rates stay above this key support level.

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/homosexual-pepe-homopepe-solana-memecoin-to-explode-18000-before-exchange-listing-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

In a new CNBC interview, the Fundstrat co-founder and managing partner says the current macroeconomic backdrop will sustain stock market rallies next year. Lee also says he sees investors waiting on the wings to start piling into the S&P 500 in 2025. “I think there [are] a lot more tailwinds building for markets in 2025 than have existed in 2024 mainly because now we’re not worrying about the Fed worrying about inflation and bringing a halt to the economy. We have an election that’s behind us, and now we have a lot of cash on the sidelines and I think companies finally having more courage – what we call animal spirits – and a willingness to start to do mergers and other things like capital markets that help stocks next year.” In October, Lee said that $6 trillion worth of capital that’s been sitting on the sidelines could fuel further stock market surges. He also noted that recession fears have kept many investors from diving into the equity market. “It feels like investors are under-invested in stocks. I think there’s people who’ve dreaded 2024 thinking this is the year we slip into a recession, and instead, and we’re seeing it with earnings, companies have been really resilient.” As of Friday’s close, the S&P 500 traded at 5,970 points.

With its innovative watch-to-earn protocol, Script Network aims to redefine how users engage with streaming platforms by incentivizing viewers with SCPT tokens. SCPT Price Analysis and Prediction As of December 27, 2024, SCPT is trading at $0.0087, reflecting a slight decrease of 2.34% over the past 24 hours. Despite this, the token has maintained steady growth since its mainnet launch in October 2024, driven by platform adoption and strategic initiatives. Notably, Script Network's recent 72 million token burn program is set to reduce supply significantly over the next two years. This move aims to enhance SCPT's scarcity and long-term value, aligning with the token's growing utility within the Script ecosystem. Analyst predictions for SCPT vary: CoinCodex forecasts a modest price increase to $0.0122 by early 2025. Bitnation projects a more bullish trajectory, estimating SCPT could reach $0.0235 by the end of 2024. With over 600,000 active users and live availability on 300 million devices, Script Network is positioning itself as a leader in Web3 entertainment, making SCPT a token to watch. PENGU Price Prediction PENGU, the native token of Pengu Finance, has also been drawing attention due to its innovative staking and gaming features. Currently priced at $0.032, PENGU has experienced a notable surge in interest, fueled by the growth of its NFT staking platform. Analysts predict moderate growth for PENGU: CoinCodex estimates a price of $0.039 by January 2025. Bitnation forecasts a year-end target of $0.045, citing the increasing adoption of Pengu's gaming ecosystem. MOVE Price Prediction MOVE, the governance token of MoveFi, a decentralized finance protocol for fitness enthusiasts, is gaining traction for its unique move-to-earn model. MOVE is trading at $0.015, showing steady adoption among fitness-conscious crypto users. Analyst predictions include: CoinCodex suggests a slight rise to $0.018 within the next month. Bitnation is more optimistic, projecting a price of $0.025 by the end of 2024. Final Thoughts With SCPT leading the charge in blockchain-based entertainment, alongside the growing potential of PENGU and MOVE in their respective niches, these tokens represent compelling opportunities for traders and investors alike. However, as always, the highly volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets necessitates careful research and risk assessment. For SCPT, the ongoing adoption of Script Network's ecosystem and its ambitious burn program could prove pivotal in shaping the token's future performance.

Is It Set to Outshine XRP & Tron’s Crypto Dominance?,"XRP, Tron, and Web3Bay are transforming the crypto world with their distinct advancements. XRP’s impressive 20% rise to $2 signals a positive market reaction to potential regulatory changes, highlighted by rumors of SEC Chairman Gensler’s impending resignation. Tron maintains its leadership with an impressive Q3 revenue of $577 million and a growing user base. Web3Bay , however, surpasses both with its innovative concept for decentralized e-commerce. Eliminating middlemen and granting users governance through 3BAY tokens, Web3Bay showcases the future of Web3 commerce. Its presale, promising an astounding 6430% ROI for early backers, establishes Web3Bay not just as a cryptocurrency player but as a pioneering ecosystem set to lead. XRP’s Remarkable Price Jump Amid Regulatory Changes XRP has recently seen a significant price jump, with a 20% increase positioning it around $2. This surge stems from speculation around SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s potential resignation, which could lead to a more favorable regulatory environment for XRP and the wider crypto market. This change in regulatory atmosphere has renewed interest in Ripple’s native token as a prime candidate for the next market upswing. Additionally, Robinhood has broadened its crypto offerings to include XRP, enhancing its market presence and attracting more retail investors. Ripple’s ongoing partnerships and its expanding application in cross-border payments further solidify XRP’s real-world utility. Rising on-chain activities within the XRP Ledger are also bolstering positive market sentiment. Analysts suggest that surpassing the $2.5 resistance could lead to further gains, potentially nearing the $3 threshold. Tron’s Exceptional Market Achievement & Growth Tron is currently experiencing robust market momentum, recently reaching a high of $0.1914, supported by increased trading volumes and a revival in investor interest following Bitcoin’s upturn. With over 271 million accounts and 50 million weekly transactions, Tron’s growing ecosystem underscores its escalating adoption and influence. Financially, Tron has exceeded other leading blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, with a record $577 million in Q3 2024 revenues. This highlights Tron’s ability to sustain income through its decentralized finance and application platforms, continually attracting developers and users. Analysts foresee further growth for TRX, with predictions suggesting it might soon approach $0.20. Why Web3Bay Might Be the Top Crypto Venture This Year Web3Bay is redefining e-commerce by shifting away from traditional intermediary-reliant frameworks to a user-empowered decentralized marketplace. This reformation not only saves money but also allows users to influence the platform’s direction through governance rights associated with 3BAY tokens. For early investors, Web3Bay’s presale presents an exciting opportunity, starting at just $0.003 per token. With a planned 28-stage price increase, culminating at $0.1959, early backers could see a return of 6430%, with some analysts forecasting up to a 40,000% ROI, positioning it as an attractive investment prior to 2025. Web3Bay is not just participating in the Web3 evolution; it is spearheading it. As blockchain becomes fundamental to various sectors, Web3Bay is ideally placed to capitalize on this shift. Investing in Web3Bay could be akin to investing in a future rival to giants like Amazon, but with the added advantage of influencing its development. Key Insights As XRP gains from prospective regulatory changes and Tron benefits from its ecosystem expansion and high revenues, Web3Bay leads by transforming e-commerce with blockchain technology. Unlike traditional models, Web3Bay offers users complete control over their data and transactions, removing expensive intermediaries. The 3BAY token goes beyond basic utility by providing governance rights, exclusive rewards, and a chance to shape the platform’s future. Its presale, starting at a mere $0.003 per token, opens up a potential ROI of 6430%, making it one of the most enticing opportunities in the crypto space.

Despite this impressive achievement, the price of ADA has been steadily falling, causing concern among investors. At the same time, DTX Exchange is making significant strides in the crypto market, attracting attention with its innovative features. In this article, we will discuss the reasons behind ADA’s price decline, the rise of DTX Exchange, and what these developments mean for investors. Cardano’s Price Dip: A Prime Buy Opportunity Amid Market Caution Cardano (ADA) has been losing value steadily since early December, dropping to a low of $0.86 for the month. This decline has made ADA investors worried about the start of the new year. However, some signs show there might be a good chance to buy Cardano for those who think long-term. A Chance to Buy Cardano Cardano’s MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) ratio suggests it might be a good time to buy. Right now, the MVRV ratio is between -13% and -26%, which has been a good range for buying ADA in the past. When the MVRV ratio is in this range, the price of Cardano often goes up again, giving investors a chance to make a profit. Cardano’s Price Drop: Seizing the Buy Opportunity Amid Network Concerns Buying Cardano now could lead to good returns, especially since the cryptocurrency has bounced back in similar situations before. Even though people are cautious right now, the MVRV ratio shows that ADA might be priced lower than its true value, making it a smart choice for investors who plan to hold it for a while. Challenges for Cardano However, there are some problems. The Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio for Cardano is at its highest level in 22 months, which is a bad sign. A high NVT ratio means that the value of the network is much higher than the amount of activity happening on it. This shows that people are not using Cardano as much, and investors are less interested. This difference means that even though Cardano’s price is high, it’s not being used much in real life. Investors should think about this when deciding if Cardano will go up in the short term or grow in the long term. DTX Exchange: A Comprehensive Trading Platform In contrast to investing solely in Cardano, DTX Exchange offers a versatile platform for managing a wide range of assets. DTX Exchange is the first crypto-native platform to provide trading for stocks, forex, ETFs, and over 100,000 currency pairs. This means you don’t need to switch between different platforms to manage your investments—you can handle everything in one place with DTX Exchange. This comprehensive service is powered by the VulcanX blockchain, which is built to work seamlessly with traditional assets like stocks and forex. The VulcanX blockchain has already launched its testnet and is expected to handle over 100,000 transactions per second (TPS), ensuring fast and efficient trading. DTX Exchange: The Future of Mixed Trading Platforms Many utility tokens are mostly owned by big investment firms. When regular traders join the market, these large investors often sell their tokens, which makes the prices go down. Also, some projects release their tokens slowly, which can make your share smaller over time. But DTX Exchange is different. When DTX fully launches on platforms like Uniswap, Binance, and Bybit, its price is expected to be $0.20. Right now, it’s only $0.14. This means early buyers could see their investment grow by up to 80% when it lists. Those who joined in earlier rounds have already seen their investments increase by 500%. DTX Exchange has already raised over $10.7 million, and its presale stage 7 has just started with more than 300,000 wallet addresses participating.

38261135,https://thecoinrise.com/alex-thorn-suggests-possible-paths-for-defi-over-new-broker-rule/,1735466043,Alex Thorn Suggests Possible Paths for DeFi Over New Broker Rule,"The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has thrown the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry into turmoil with its recently finalized reporting rule that designates DeFi front-ends as brokerages . Issued on December 27, 2024, the rule mandates these platforms to comply with broker reporting requirements, a move that has sparked outcry across the crypto sector. Limited Options for DeFi Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy Digital, has identified three potential paths forward for DeFi platforms under this regulation. According to Thorn, these platforms can either comply and function as brokerages, block access for U.S. users, or adopt extreme decentralization by forgoing upgrades and revenue generation. Thorn emphasized that only highly decentralized platforms—those without front-end interfaces, non-upgradeable smart contracts, and no fee collection mechanisms—could potentially avoid the “broker” designation. “Said another way, extremely decentralized applications are not in a position to know and thus could not comply with broker reporting requirements,” he noted. Industry Pushback and Legal Action The announcement by IRS has ignited fierce opposition from the crypto industry, with executives and advocacy groups labeling the rule as overreach. Bill Hughes, an attorney for blockchain software firm Consensys, criticized the IRS for releasing the rule at the tail end of the year during the holiday season. “This rule has been ready to go for a while. They dump it…as if we wouldn’t notice or make an absolute ruckus over it,” Hughes stated. On the same day the rule was published, a coalition of crypto advocacy groups—including the Texas Blockchain Council, Blockchain Association, and DeFi Education Fund—filed a lawsuit against the IRS. The lawsuit alleges that the rule represents unconstitutional overreach by the Department of the Treasury and the IRS. Industry leaders have also called on Congress to step in and block the rule, arguing that it could stifle innovation and drive DeFi platforms away from U.S. markets. If implemented, the reporting requirements will take effect in 2027, giving platforms some time to adjust or push back.

38262525,https://invezz.com/?p=2408412,1735465140,Meme coin mania: top 3 cryptos that dominated 2024,"The cryptocurrency market, a space known for its constant evolution, continues to introduce new digital assets at a rapid pace. Among these, meme-based cryptocurrencies have experienced a surge in popularity, driven by their strong connections to internet culture and social media trends. Despite their often volatile nature, meme coins have successfully captured the attention of investors worldwide. For those willing to navigate the inherent risks, here’s a look at three noteworthy meme coins that stood out in 2024. The rise of meme coins: beyond the joke Meme coins represent a unique category in the crypto space, drawing inspiration directly from internet memes and social media phenomena. Their value isn’t rooted in traditional utility but rather in their association with viral culture. These coins are known for their price volatility and their popularity is often fueled by viral internet trends and endorsements from influential figures like Elon Musk, whose tweets can often have an outsized impact on their market capitalization. Dogecoin: the original meme coin pioneer Emerging in 2013, Dogecoin was created as a playful tribute to the popular Shiba Inu dog meme. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin has no limit on the number of coins that can be generated. It operates using a proof-of-work consensus algorithm, where miners use computational power to solve complex math problems, validate transactions, and earn Dogecoin rewards. While Dogecoin gained mainstream attention in early 2021 following celebrity endorsements, its value remains highly volatile. Primarily used for online tipping and microtransactions, Dogecoin can also be traded for other cryptocurrencies or traditional fiat currencies. Shiba Inu: the Dogecoin rival Introduced in August 2020, Shiba Inu (SHIB) was developed as a direct competitor to Dogecoin. It is a cryptocurrency operating on the Ethereum blockchain using a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm, where validators are chosen based on the number of SHIB tokens they hold, rather than computing power. Created anonymously by an individual or group known as “Ryoshi,” SHIB aimed to build a decentralized community of token holders who could exchange tokens and participate in governance decisions. Like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu’s value has been subject to significant volatility, and its primary use case has been speculative trading, as opposed to acting as a payment method. Pepe coin: the frog’s memetic leap Pepe Coin is a more recent addition to the meme coin landscape, taking its inspiration from the well-known “Pepe the Frog” meme. The project boasts a circulating supply of 420 trillion tokens, with over 90% securely locked in liquidity pools. Since its launch, Pepe Coin has witnessed a significant surge in market capitalization, and has rapidly grown in popularity. Investing in meme coins is known to be highly risky, but Pepe Coin stands out as a token that managed to capture the zeitgeist.

38260259,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/is-restaking-bitcoin-a-low-risk-path-to-compound-interest,1735464137,Is Restaking Bitcoin A Low-Risk Path to Compound Interest?,"Source: Midjourney Any time you see a new opportunity to make money at no or low risk to yourself, it’s wise to be wary. However, that isn’t the same thing as immediately dismissing it. Sometimes there are lower-risk investments, just as there are high-risk investments. Putting all your money into the stock of a startup, even if it does have a “revolutionary business model,” is a higher-risk investment. Sure, you might win big and be one of those savvy visionaries who got in on the ground floor. Statistics say, however, that you are likely going to stay on the ground floor and watch your investment crash. This is why we diversify, which allows us to be able to jump on these high-risk, high-reward deals, but only when a relatively small amount of the portfolio. Where does crypto land in this spectrum of risky investments? That is a difficult question because while many insane meme coins will spike and crash this week alone, that doesn’t represent the crypto market. The last few years have shown that even in spite of a few fads and rough patches, the market itself continues to grow in value and momentum. Nowhere is this clearer than with Bitcoin, the original token that started it all and becomes even more of a legend each year? Following the longer-term trend, Bitcoin’s story is beyond incredible. Will this pattern continue? It’s impossible to say, even if the long-term trend has been very good. What we have a better idea of is that Bitcoin will likely continue to be valuable in the market, and that is enough to create some opportunities. While people can choose to stake their Bitcoin and earn returns via staking rewards, the real question is whether or not they should double down and restake those returns, or cash out and diversify. There are cases to be made for both. A lot of it has to do with what exactly is staked and re-staked. If the staking is done on a general crypto platform with the normal set of features, the odds of a good return may be less than ideal. However, if the staking is tied to something value-added, something that can generate what is called a “positively reinforcing cycle,” it might be worth doing. Let’s discuss the basics of Bitcoin staking, the pros and cons, and the possibility that Bitcoin Validated Services (BVS), as designed by the SatLayer platform, might be able to generate the positively reinforcing cycle ideal for restakers. Restaking Pros and Cons Let’s first explain restaking at its most basic. An investor can stake their crypto to a particular platform, which then uses the frozen assets to build up stability in the platform and the token, while also helping to show the strength of support the platform has. The more assets staked on a platform, the more stable and secure that platform can be. The staked currency helps to generate returns that are then rewarded to the key members of the platform: the stakers, validators, and key participants who might supply a service. These rewards are crucial because they incentivize the actors to play their roles well and accomplish the goals of the platform. The incentives essentially motivate the ability to trust the players to perform with good intentions. When it goes well, everyone does their job well and everyone gets rewarded. The stakers who earn returns then have an important choice: do they cash out or double down, restaking their rewards into the same system in hopes of earning compound earnings? For a staker, there is no clear answer on whether or not it is best to either cash out or restake. They can review past performance gain some insight into the volatility of the token and reward themselves. They can look at what type of returns they might get by investing the returns on something different. Or they can better understand where the rewards are coming from and decide based on that. While the first two choices can offer some insight, it’s the third that offer the biggest understanding of what actions they should take. Simply put, restaking on a normal platform, unless it is incredibly stable, is a high risk. Instead of diversifying, the staker believes strongly that the current positive situation will only continue. However, this is mostly guesswork. But what if the assets being staked weren’t just stable, but were actively creating value? This could reduce the risk of restaking if the value-creating activities are beneficial and have a strong chance of building up the crypto economy. And this is where the idea of Bitcoin Validated Services (BVS) comes in. A BVS is a quickly evolving entity by which a platform can create (through smart contracts) attractive rewards for restakers who will provide support for the platform. They do this by taking a portion of their stake and delegating to an operator. The operators use the staked Bitcoin as collateral to create stability on the platform, and actively perform their duties to help manage the platform itself. They ensure the platform operates efficiently, and securely, and this attracts more users. Because the operators are incentivized to support the platform with their staked Bitcoin, the BVS ensures they are immediately secured in a way that native tokens can never provide. There is no more “security ramp-up” as a native token gains value. Those tokens mean security right away, which gives the platform a much better chance at success, and which means that the operators gain a generous reward. The reward is then turned around and restaked, increasing the overall return as long as Bitcoin continues to build. The “positively reinforced cycle” occurs at this point, and is what turns restaking into less of a gamble and more of an official tool for creating consistent wealth. Stakers want returns, so they delegate their stake to operators. Operators want returns, so they behave well and do their job, earning their and the stakers returns. The platforms benefit from the bolstered security and assets, growing and attracting a larger audience. The audience uses the platform and enjoys it, boosting growth and bringing the process full circle as it attracts new stakers. What Now? While restaking may normally be seen as a risky proposition, when positively reinforced cycles can be created, it’s quite a bit less guesswork to see that things are going well. There are no guarantees in life, but seeing the BVS at work shows that there is a bit of method to the madness. Building up a cycle that adds value at each step, and using a token that continues to grow in value worlds above its contemporaries, is potentially the best way to ensure that restaking rewards are brought back in for continued boosting, continuing this positive cycle for these bold restakers.

In a recent interview, Giancarlo specifically highlighted the shift from traditional value storage to blockchain-based systems in financial institutions when explaining why Bitcoin’s appeal continues to grow. “We’ve reached a stage where we can move beyond storing information on the internet and store value,” Giancarlo said. “Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies represent protocols that enable this transition to the internet of value.” He said Bitcoin’s rarity is a key differentiator from fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, which continues to lose value due to increasing pressure. Giancarlo made comparisons by noting that while the average American home price has nearly doubled in five years, its value in Bitcoin has drastically decreased, demonstrating Bitcoin’s strength as an appreciating asset. Related News: Cardano (ADA) Founder Charles Hoskinson Talks About Ripple (XRP) Giancarlo also pointed to global adoption trends, noting that countries like El Salvador have benefited significantly from adopting Bitcoin. The country, which made Bitcoin its official currency in 2021, has seen the value of its reserves triple in just two years. With Bitcoin’s rise coinciding with expectations of a more positive crypto regulation in the U.S., Giancarlo believes the technology underlying cryptocurrencies will play a transformative role. “Banks went bankrupt, but the internet hasn’t gone bankrupt in 40 years,” Giancarlo said, adding that blockchain technology could make processes like property transfers instantaneous by eliminating middlemen. *This is not investment advice.

38260811,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53273,1735462858,"XRP Fails to Rally Despite HSBC Partnership, But This Popular DeFi Altcoin Is Surging After Christmas","The gigantic partnership between Ripple (XRP) and the financial giant HSBC has created headlines in the cryptocurrency space. However, this billion-dollar collaboration has failed to impact the XRP price, which has been consolidating in a pattern. From the peak formed on 3 December, the XRP price has dropped 26%, suggesting a shift in market sentiments. In the post-Christmas rally, the market favored low-cap utility altcoins like DTX Exchange (DTX), a decentralized hybrid trading platform disrupting the trillion-dollar trading sector. Market experts predict DTX Exchange is potentially heading towards a blockbuster listing in the first quarter of 2025. XRP Price Forms Historic Pattern Amid Correction Despite the ongoing bull run and investors basking in gains, Ripple’s results are not so rosy amidst the market correction. Ripple has decreased 6.03% over the last week, although monthly gains still remain intact. The XRP price has formed a wedge formation which is usually a signal of continuity; nevertheless, some investors are griping about the negative conditions of the market. Courtesy: TradingView The XRP price has local resistance near the upper trendline of the wedge pattern, which has been tested twice since its formation. The lower trendline has continuously worked as support. XRP price is still trading above the 50-period moving average, which is positive because it signals the short-term price direction. The digital asset custody market is expected to grow over the years, and HSBC’s expanding involvement strengthens this outlook. Analysts believe this growing institutional support could drive XRP’s price to $5. By focusing on tokenized securities and custody solutions, Ripple (XRP) and HSBC are well-positioned to benefit from the rising institutional interest in digital assets. Bulls have not favored the XRP price in the short term despite important events such as the HSBC partnership and the recent launch of the RLUSD stablecoin. DTX Exchange (DTX): Pioneering In The Hybrid Technology The DTX Exchange (DTX) isn’t just another crypto project; DTX plots to overturn traditional trading through its hybrid exchange platform. DTX Exchange is building a unified trading experience through the best of both centralized and decentralized exchanges. DTX Exchange’s technical foundation relies on smart contracts.

38260234,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=667965,1735462812,"Bitcoin Whale Moves 8,000 BTC Aged 5-7 Years – What Happened Last Time","Bitcoin continues to grapple with the psychological $100,000 milestone, failing to break above this critical resistance after a retrace from all-time highs. This prolonged stagnation has sparked discussions about a potential correction or deeper retrace as the market awaits confirmation of Bitcoin’s next major move. Both analysts and investors are closely monitoring the situation, eager to discern whether the cryptocurrency will rally to new heights or succumb to selling pressure. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Bought Over 90 Million DOGE In 48H – Details Adding fuel to these concerns, renowned analyst Maartunn recently highlighted alarming on-chain activity. Over 8,000 BTC, aged between five and seven years, have moved on-chain, raising questions about long-term holders’ intentions. Historically, such movements have often preceded market shifts, with increased selling pressure signaling potential weakness. The activity from these seasoned wallets could reflect fading confidence or profit-taking, keeping Bitcoin subdued under the $100K threshold. While bulls and bears remain locked in a battle for dominance, this significant metric underscores the growing uncertainty. As Bitcoin’s trajectory hangs in the balance, market participants brace for clarity on whether this pivotal level will eventually transform into solid support—or mark the start of a downward correction. Smart Money Moving Bitcoin Since early December, Bitcoin has entered a prolonged consolidation phase, struggling to establish clear momentum in either direction. Recent on-chain data suggests that whale activity is playing a pivotal role in keeping the price suppressed. According to top analyst Maartunn, a familiar entity—an old Bitcoin whale—has resurfaced, making significant moves that could influence the market’s trajectory. Maartunn emphasizes that the movement of more than 8,000 BTC echoes a pattern seen just 10 days ago. At that time, the same whale reportedly shifted more than 72,000 BTC in total since the consolidation phase began. This whale, often referred to as “smart money,” has been active like never before, signaling strategic positioning rather than impulsive selling. The implications of this activity are profound. As long as this whale continues to offload BTC, the selling pressure could hold Bitcoin below key psychological levels, extending the current consolidation period for a few more weeks. However, this accumulation and redistribution phase could set the stage for a massive rally once the activity subsides. Related Reading: Chainlink Is Forming A Head-And-Shoulders Pattern – Confirmation Could Take LINK To $14 Analysts interpret this as a period of preparation by seasoned market participants, suggesting that when the dust settles, Bitcoin might experience a powerful upward breakout. BTC Above Key Demand Level Bitcoin is currently trading at $95,000 after managing to hold above the critical $92,000 support level. Despite bears maintaining control over the market in recent weeks, they have been unable to break through the key demand zones at $92,000 and $90,000. These levels have acted as a strong base, preventing further downside and signaling resilience among buyers. If Bitcoin continues to defend these crucial levels, it could pave the way for a swift challenge to its all-time high (ATH). Holding above $92,000 would reinforce bullish sentiment and attract renewed interest from traders and institutional investors eyeing the psychological $100,000 milestone. However, the path ahead is far from guaranteed. A failed attempt to reclaim $100,000 could signal exhaustion among buyers, potentially triggering a deeper correction. Such a scenario might see Bitcoin revisiting lower support zones as market participants reassess their strategies.

38262468,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323227,1735462631,Blockchain Association Sues IRS Over New Crypto Regulations,"The Blockchain Association, in collaboration with the Texas Blockchain Council, has launched a lawsuit against the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) over its latest cryptocurrency regulations. The legal challenge, announced on Dec. 28 , pushes back against the IRS’ new rules requiring brokers to report digital asset transactions, which are set to take effect in 2027. Under these final regulations, brokers will be mandated to report gross proceeds from cryptocurrency and digital asset sales, as well as details about taxpayers involved in such transactions. New IRS Rules Broaden Definition of Broker The rules broaden the definition of a “broker” to include decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and front-end platforms that facilitate digital asset transactions. Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, stated in a social media post that the lawsuit argues the IRS’ rulemaking violates the Administrative Procedure Act and infringes on constitutional rights. “We stand with our nation’s innovators and will continue working to ensure the future of crypto — and DeFi — is here in the United States.” Today we’re taking action, filing a lawsuit that argues today’s broker rulemaking violates the Administrative Procedure Act and is unconstitutional. We stand with our nation’s innovators and will continue working to ensure the future of crypto – and DeFi – is here in the United… https://t.co/CwZWzjwT5O — Kristin Smith (@KMSmithDC) December 28, 2024 The new rules have raised concerns among blockchain developers and decentralized finance (DeFi) advocates. Platforms using smart contracts to facilitate transactions could now be classified as brokers, placing significant compliance burdens on developers of DeFi front-ends. The Blockchain Association has criticized the IRS for imposing “unlawful compliance burdens” on software developers, warning that this could stifle innovation in the U.S. The broader crypto community fears these regulations could drive DeFi innovation offshore. Marisa Coppel, Head of Legal at the Blockchain Association, described the rules as a privacy violation, stating that requiring DeFi platforms to report user data would undermine the core values of decentralization. Legal experts have drawn parallels to the case of Tornado Cash developer Alex Pertsev, who was sentenced to over five years in prison for facilitating illicit transactions through non-custodial software. The precedent adds weight to concerns about the potential criminalization of developers under these rules. The IRS estimates that between 650 and 875 DeFi brokers, along with up to 2.6 million U.S. taxpayers, will be impacted by the regulations. Brokers will need to start collecting transaction data in 2026 for reporting requirements starting in 2027. Industry Analysts Outline Possible Paths Forward Industry analysts have outlined possible paths forward for DeFi platforms if the regulations are not overturned. Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy Digital, suggested that platforms could either comply with the broker designation, block U.S. users, or operate as decentralized applications with minimal user interaction and no transaction fees to avoid broker classification. “No shortage of ways to challenge this, and it absolutely should be challenged,” Uniswap Chief Legal Officer (CLO) Katherine Minarik said in a December 27 post on X . She questioned the IRS’s rationale, arguing that the ruling incorrectly classifies DeFi platforms as brokers, despite their role being only a part of transaction processes. Uniswap CEO Hayden Adams expressed similar concerns, stating that he hopes the ruling will be overturned through the Congressional Review Act (CRA) or legal challenges.

38259481,https://crypto.news/?p=14322954,1735462466,This crypto under $0.20 could soon explode as Ripple and Cardano did in the last 2 months,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Investors eye Rexas Finance as the next big crypto under $0.20, following Cardano and Ripple’s recent success. Table of Contents Cardano and Ripple’s case Rexas Finance: Big opportunity for the future A powerful, practically useful ecosystem Veracity and confirmed security Conclusion: Now’s the moment to act Investors in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrencies are constantly searching for the next great chance combining ingenuity, strong foundations, and the possibility for exponential rewards. Though well-known coins like Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) have made news with their recent increases, Rexas Finance (RXS) has lately grown more and more important due to its amazing upside potential. Following Cardano and Ripple’s footsteps, Rexas Finance, presently selling at less than $0.20, seems to be the next cryptocurrency ready for amazing expansion. Strong security credentials, a utility-rich environment, and a very successful presale all help to make RXS’s argument as the best cryptocurrency to monitor in 2024 convincing. You might also like: Rexas Finance poised to be future of RWA tokenization: Fourth presale stage ends earlier than predicted Cardano and Ripple’s case Two outstanding examples of cryptocurrencies that have shown how strategically important benchmarks and market confidence may generate notable price swings are Cardano and Ripple. For instance, thanks in part to partial success in a lawsuit against the SEC and its 40% rise post-U.S election, ripple returned in 2024. This triumph not only cleared regulatory uncertainties but also attracted investor interest, hence raising the XRP value. Cardano’s dedication to technological innovation — especially improvements in its smart contract features — has helped it maintain steady development. Both coins have shown that as well as price rises, consistent performance and a well-defined plan may inspire investor confidence. However, as these cryptocurrencies develop, the possibility of large short-term gains reduces. Here’s where Rexas Finance excels. Rexas Finance: Big opportunity for the future Given its Stage 10 presale of just $0.15, Rexas Finance offers a special chance for investors looking for both quick gains and long-term value. Having sold approximately 375 million tokens, the presale has now generated an amazing $32,834,721, surpassing 99.43% of its aim. Early investors can get a three-fold return by the time of launch from the projected listing price of $0.20; the token price is expected to rise to $0.175 in the next stage. Rexas Finance gives those who lost out on the early development of Ripple or Cardano a second chance to enter the first floor of a viable company. Rexas Finance stands out mostly for its rich ecosystem, which is meant to address practical issues. Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization — a novel idea that closes the distance between conventional banking and blockchain technology — is the main emphasis of this ecosystem. By tokenizing assets, including real estate, commodities, and collectibles, Rexas Finance democratizes access to investment possibilities and lets people participate in markets once controlled by institutions. Fractionalizing ownership reduces entrance barriers, increasing high-value assets’ availability to a bigger audience. A powerful, practically useful ecosystem Additionally included in the Rexas Finance ecosystem are several special platforms meant for a wide spectrum of consumers. Rexas Token Builder lets customers tokenize their assets in minutes, therefore removing the technical knowledge requirement. This tool lets artists and producers easily enter the blockchain universe. Rexas Launchpad’s decentralized fundraising platform gives businesses and original ideas a safe and transparent way to raise money. Rexas Estate lets investors co-own real-world buildings, producing stablecoins’ passive income. Targeting the booming digital art scene, Rexas GenAI creates original NFTs using artificial intelligence. Additionally, Rexas DeFi offers a multi-chain decentralized finance solution to ease cryptocurrency trading and yield generation. Rexas Finance is positioned by this multifarious and utility-driven ecosystem as more than just a speculative investment. Practically speaking, this project has uses for real estate investors, NFT creators, and DeFi aficionados, among other audiences. While Cardano concentrates on scalable smart contracts and Ripple shines in cross-border payments, Rexas Finance intends to change many sectors by offering a dynamic and flexible reaction to worldwide markets. Veracity and confirmed security Any cryptocurrency business depends critically on security and credibility, and Rexas Finance shines in both areas. One of the most well-known names in blockchain security, CertiK examined the initiative holistically. In addition to verifying the integrity of Rexas Finance’s smart contracts, this accreditation provides investors with peace of mind should fraud or vulnerabilities worry them. Moreover, the success of the presale and the forthcoming release of the project on main platforms at a projected price of $0.20 underline the increasing validity and market presence of the project. RXS is positioned to gain on these positive market conditions as the cryptocurrency market is returning from a bad cycle, and demand for new projects is rising. The presale will reward early adopters; the momentum it creates demonstrates great market confidence in the future of the endeavor. Additionally, Rexas Finance’s appeal is helped by its inclusion on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, which lets investors monitor its performance and validate its legitimacy. Conclusion: Now’s the moment to act Rexas Finance holds the secret to equally explosive expansion, even if Ripple and Cardano have become crypto behemoths. Its established security credentials, feature-rich ecosystem, and effective presale set it apart from other projects available. Clearly, the coin to have on hand for investors seeking January 2025 and beyond — one with possibly life-changing value — is Rexas Finance.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-cyborg-trumpcyb-solana-memecoin-to-rally-15000-before-exchange-listing-as-bonk-wif-and-dogecoin-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Meanwhile, spot Ether ETFs ended the year on a high note, amassing $349.3 million in inflows during the last four trading days, pushing their total to $2.68 billion since their July 23 launch, according to Farside Investors . BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) led the market with $37.31 billion in inflows, followed by Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) with $11.84 billion, and ARK’s 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) with $2.49 billion. Bitwise ETF Recorded Over $2 Billion in Inflows Other significant contributors included the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), which reported $2.19 billion in inflows. These figures far surpassed Galaxy Digital’s initial $14 billion first-year estimate. However, Bitcoin ETFs faced a slight downturn toward the year’s end, with $1.33 billion in outflows since Dec. 19. Five of the last six trading days saw net outflows, with IBIT experiencing its largest single-day outflow of $188.7 million on Dec. 24. Retail investors accounted for nearly 80% of the demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs, according to an October report from Binance. Still, industry experts anticipate increased institutional participation in 2025 as more clearinghouses for spot Bitcoin ETF trading become operational. Bitwise’s Chief Investment Officer, Matt Hougan, projects that this shift could push Bitcoin prices to $200,000 by 2025, with VanEck forecasting a more conservative $180,000. 2025 PREDICTION: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana will hit new all-time highs.

Grayscale’s low-fee Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH) secured $608.1 million in inflows, while the Bitwise Ethereum ETF (ETHW) crossed $400 million. Though Ether underperformed Bitcoin and Solana in 2024, analysts predict a rebound in 2025. Factors such as Ethereum Layer 2 expansion, increasing spot Ether ETF flows, and the tokenization of real-world assets are expected to drive Ether’s price to a potential high of $7,000, according to Bitwise’s Ryan Rasmussen and Matt Hougan. Digital Asset Investment Products Saw $308M Inflows Last Week Digital asset investment products experienced net inflows of $308 million last week, though this figure conceals a significant single-day outflow of $576 million on December 19. The week ended with a total outflow of $1 billion over its final two days, triggered largely by market reactions to the Federal Reserve’s hawkish dot plot announcement. These movements led to a $17.7 billion reduction in total assets under management (AuM) for digital asset ETPs, marking a 0.37% decline in AuM. While concerning, this outflow is modest compared to the largest single-day outflow of 2.3% in mid-2022, which followed an FOMC interest rate hike. Bitcoin saw resilience with net inflows of $375 million for the week, while multi-asset investment products bore the brunt of the losses, shedding $121 million. Ethereum continued its streak with $51 million in inflows, offset by Solana’s $8.7 million outflows. Altcoins such as XRP, Horizen, and Polkadot saw smaller but notable inflows.

His post on X began an intriguing discussion about the different role RLUSD plays, and why cryptocurrencies like XRP remain indispensable. Hope you have read the user terms for RLUSD! Hint: It’s extensive! And it’s crucial knowing the rules in beforehand since Ripple can freeze RLUSD. But it also shows why stablecoins won’t replace cryptocurrencies. pic.twitter.com/DhtcqTpZm4 — Anders (@X__Anderson) December 28, 2024 Limitations On RLUSD RLUSD has comprehensive terms of service. It outlines stringent restrictions on its use. According to the agreement, RLUSD cannot be used for transactions involving regulated products, such as marijuana, tobacco, or firearms, nor for adult content, pseudo-pharmaceuticals, or any high-risk businesses. Ripple broadly defines high-risk businesses, encompassing activities like gambling (e.g., poker or horse racing) unless explicitly licensed by the relevant jurisdictions. Ripple also retains the right to suspend or terminate a user’s RLUSD account if these terms are violated, which could lead to a freeze of funds. As Anders noted, this means users engaging in prohibited activities, such as buying drug paraphernalia or participating in online poker, risk having their RLUSD accounts frozen. While these restrictions align with regulatory compliance requirements and the policies of financial institutions, they illustrate a key limitation of stablecoins: their centralized oversight. RLUSD is notable, as it was approved by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). However, Ripple’s ability to freeze accounts and restrict usage contrasts sharply with the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies like XRP, which operate without centralized control. Decentralization Shows the Importance of Cryptocurrencies This regulatory environment is one of the reasons Anders argues stablecoins are not a replacement for cryptocurrencies. He clarified that his critique is aimed at those who believe Ripple and other entities will exclusively rely on stablecoins like RLUSD for transactions, relegating XRP to a mere “gas token.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Anders’ post shows that stablecoins, while useful for maintaining price stability, lack the censorship resistance and permissionless attributes of cryptocurrencies. “I’m trying to show why XRP and crypto are needed,” he explained. The discussion also highlights the distinct purposes of stablecoins and cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins such as RLUSD are designed for price stability, making them ideal for specific use cases. However, their reliance on centralized issuers and adherence to regulatory frameworks limit their utility in scenarios requiring financial sovereignty and unregulated transactions. In contrast, cryptocurrencies like XRP offer a decentralized alternative, allowing users to transact without the risk of account freezes or usage restrictions. This autonomy is critical in contexts where financial freedom and resistance to censorship are paramount. In a world where free speech is constantly threatened and unnecessarily stringent crypto regulation is becoming the norm, these decentralized assets can play a crucial role in giving autonomy and power to the people.

On Dec. 29, the country added one more Bitcoin to its portfolio, bringing its total holdings to 6,000.77 BTC, valued at approximately $569.3 million, according to the National Bitcoin Office’s portfolio tracker . The country’s Bitcoin investment has surged by 108.02%, with an average purchase price of $45,450 per coin, based on President Nayib Bukele’s portfolio tracker. El Salvador Continues Bitcoin Push El Salvador began its Bitcoin journey on Sept. 6, 2021, purchasing its first 200 BTC, shortly before becoming the first nation to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. Among nations with significant Bitcoin reserves, El Salvador ranks sixth, trailing the United States, China, the United Kingdom, Ukraine, and Bhutan, as per BitBo’s Bitcoin Treasuries data. Despite facing international criticism, including from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Bukele administration remains committed to its Bitcoin strategy.

The government has also clarified it has no plans to sell its holdings, reaffirming that Bitcoin remains central to its economic strategy. The Chivo wallet, El Salvador’s official Bitcoin wallet, will reportedly be sold or phased out, with private-sector wallets expected to fill the gap. Meanwhile, the $1.4 billion deal with the IMF remains pending approval. The negotiations, strained by the government’s Bitcoin policies, could mark a turning point after four years of discussions. US States Consider Adding Bitcoin To Reserves Ohio has become the latest US state to consider adding Bitcoin to its treasury reserves, following the introduction of a new bill by House Republican leader Derek Merrin. The initiative mirrors recent moves by Texas and Pennsylvania to establish Bitcoin reserves. On 12 December 2024, Texas Representative Giovanni Capriglione introduced the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, which proposes that the state comptroller hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset for at least five years. Pennsylvania took a similar step in November, with Representative Mike Cabell proposing a bill to allow its treasury to allocate up to 10% of its balance sheet in Bitcoin, citing the asset’s potential to hedge against economic uncertainty. Furthermore, corporate Bitcoin holders like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet have expanded their Bitcoin holdings. MARA Holdings (MARA) has also bought 11,774 BTC in the latest acquisition, the company announced on X on Dec. 10. Likewise, Riot Platforms, a Bitcoin mining company, announced plans to raise $500 million through a private bond offering to bolster its Bitcoin reserves further. However, the United States government is not expected to purchase Bitcoin in 2025, according to Galaxy Digital’s head of research, Alex Thorn. In a report published on December 27, Thorn predicted that while discussions around a Bitcoin reserve policy may progress, the government will focus on managing its existing Bitcoin stockpile rather than acquiring more.

It managed to bounce off immediately and headed toward $100,000 on a couple of occasions since then = on December 22 and 26 – but to no avail. Each attempt was met with a vicious rejection that pushed the cryptocurrency south by several grand. The last such movement came at the end of the business week, and BTC slumped toward $93,000. It defended that level and jumped to $94,000 yesterday and $95,000 now. This is somewhat expected given the declining trading volumes as of late, which could actually be a blessing in disguise for BTC and other assets if whales continue to make big purchases. For now, though, BTC’s market cap remains well below $1.9 trillion on CG, and its dominance over the alts has been reduced to 54%. Bitcoin/Price/Chart 29.12.2024. Source: TradingView SOL, SUI Recover Most altcoins suffered badly yesterday but have produced some minor increases over the past 24 hours. ETH has climbed above $3,400, XRP is close to $2.2, while BNB continues to defy the market sentiment with a 2.5% jump to $718. Dogecoin has added over 3% of value and stands close to $0.33, while SOL and SUI have gained 5-6%. As a result, SOL now trades above $195, while SUI is north of $4.25. Other notable gainers include HBAR, DOT, AAVE, APT, ICP, and PEPE. The total crypto market cap has recovered about $50 billion since yesterday and is close to $3.5 trillion on CG.

38259133,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53316,1735461019,Investors Are Aping This PropFi Coin Predicted To Outpace BNB And Cardano In The 2025 Bull Market,"Investors are pouring into a PropFi coin predicted to outpace BNB and Cardano in (ADA) the 2025 bull market. This rising DeFi coin is part of an ecosystem that stands out for its unique features. It offers no transaction taxes, letting users keep more profits. Its staking system rewards holders, creating passive income while encouraging long-term growth. These features are fueling demand among investors seeking big returns. The PropFi coin’s utility extends to funded accounts, where traders can access large capital pools without strict entry barriers. Could this be the best crypto to buy now in the bull market? >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Binance’s Partnership With Circle Triggers Bullish Forecasts For DeFi Coins Binance recently partnered with Circle to challenge Tether’s dominance in the market. Circle’s stablecoin $USDC will be integrated into Binance’s ecosystem. This partnership is expected to bring a lot of new liquidity to Binance’s ecosystem. It could also help BNB’s price reach $700 again soon. Some DeFi coin experts think this partnership will make the first quarter of 2025 very positive for BNB. Following this announcement, BNB’s price went up last month by 43.35% and is now trading for $690 . Experts see a special pattern called a symmetrical triangle, which usually means the future price movement could be bullish or bearish. If BNB breaks out of this pattern positively, it could reach $750. If BNB doesn’t break out, it could drop to $715. Amid this price uncertainty, experts expect DeFi coins like the new PropFi coin to overtake BNB. This is primarily due to the new PropFi platform’s staking rewards program, which gives users passive income for holding the tokens. Cardano Adds $41 Million in ADA Tokens to Circulation Amid Bull Market Resurgence Cardano recently increased its supply by $41 million worth of ADA . On December 16, 2024, $20 million worth of ADA entered the market. Another $21 million followed on December 20. This move caught the attention of Cardano traders, who are closely watching the DeFi coin price. Cardano’s updates have sparked interest among investors looking for the best crypto to buy. With new tokens entering circulation and its price under pressure, all eyes are on ADA’s next move. Recently, ADA dropped to $1.06 , a marginal 11.35% dip from last week. Concerning price predictions, some Cardano experts expect an uptrend for ADA because of the recent rise in its Total Value Unlocked (TVL). This could lead to the rise of the price of ADA to $1.50 amid the bull market. On the other hand, some Cardano analysts have a skeptical outlook for ADA because the crypto market has been slow recently. As such, ADA could drop to $.085 soon. This mixed ADA forecast has investors moving to this new PropFi platform, and this is due to its Trade2Earn feature. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE FXGuys Becomes the Top Choice for DeFi Coin Traders in the Bull Market ADA and BNB holders are flocking to FXGuys ($FXG) due to its PropFi coin.

FXGuys introduces a staking feature that offers up to a 20% in APY. Even if you lose on some trades, staking your tokens ensures you still earn.

38258154,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376571,1735459650,Year in Review: Top 8 Ripple (XRP) Developments of 2024,"But real quick first— XRP’s price could be in for another big pump soon, according to the technical signals. Legendary chart trader Peter Brandt recently shared a bullish wedge pattern suggesting another leg up for XRP’s price to above $2.70. The average exchange rate in US dollars for XRP on Saturday, Dec. 28, was $2.19. So if this rally materializes, it would represent a 24% increase over Saturday’s price in potentially a matter of mere days or weeks. Here are two views of $XRPUSD a weekly chart and a daily chart Strong opinions, weakly held A chart is not an opinion and an opinion is not necessarily a position – this is a concept hard to understand by rookies pic.twitter.com/SvaT5hojLW — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 27, 2024 While this is not abnormal for crypto markets in general or for Ripple token prices in particular, these kinds of gains are significantly headier for investors’ finances than the typical performance of corporate equity shares— even for high-flying tech stocks like those on the Nasdaq. Another XRP watcher recently targeted a $4 all-time high Ripple price for the cross-border settlement token on the next big pump. That would represent an astounding 82% gain over the current price. Looking back, here’s how Ripple got here over the course of 2024: 1. Ripple Expert Touts XRPL’s DeFi Powers (Jan. 1) Ripple made some waves to start the year when XRPL developer Wietse Wind settled some misconceptions about the platform. The developer who started the XRP Ledger for decentralized finance using XRP tokens cleared up the confusion once and for all: With XRP Ledger, the native tokens can be used on a fully decentralized platform with smart contract issuance. That makes it more like Ethereum and Solana than many cryptocurrency investors are aware of even today. Wind also blasted through the FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) around regulatory threats to XRP’s economy with a recap of Ripple Labs’ decisive victories against the US Securities and Exchange Commission in the US District Court Southern District of New York. 2. XRP Ethereum Integrations Launch (Feb. 11) One of the key supports for continued, robust growth in XRP’s market valuation is its aggressive expansion into new business partnerships around the world and new integrations with support for XRP on other blockchain networks like Ethereum. In February, the CEO of Peersyst Technology, a Ripple Partner, announced a new Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain of the XRP Ledger would begin rewarding validator nodes with XRP tokens. That’s something nice for die-hard XRP Army types, who don’t have to sell the tokens to use them with Ethereum smart contracts. 3. XRP Expands in Korea and Japan (July 21) While fighting off SEC allegations of securities fraud in US court, Ripple Labs continued to advance its platform with several new overseas business partnerships this year. They will be key to growing the Ripple economy and seriously competing with SWIFT for daily payment share. In July, Ripple Labs achieved two new international expansions in the Asia-Pacific region— one in South Korea and another in Japan. In Korea, the nation’s only government-licensed VASP (virtual asset service provider), Infinite Block, announced new XRP Ledger support. The integration came mere days after Ripple Labs’ announced the creation of a new XRPL Japan and Korea Fund. 4. SEC Lawsuit Fine Cut From $2B to $150M (Aug. 8) On Aug. 8, US Judge Analisa Torres handed Ripple a resounding win in the US District Court Southern District of New York in Manhattan. The SEC was seeking a $2 billion disbursement or fine for Ripple Labs over allegations of selling XRP as an unregistered security. After the judge delivered the company three other landmark wins last year, both for Ripple Labs and for the blockchain sector in general, Torres struck a devastating blow to the government litigant in this case in August. Instead of the $2 billion the SEC sought, Torres ordered Ripple to pay a comparatively paltry $125 million. 5. Grayscale Launches XRP Trust (Sept. 12) In September, the XRP economy made a massive stride toward market adoption by regulated institutional players trading on Wall Street. Cryptocurrency asset management company Grayscale announced on Sept. 12 the creation of a new US-regulated XRP trust product. That’s similar to the Bitcoin ETFs and Ether ETFs (exchange-traded funds) that the SEC greenlit on Jan. 11 and May 23. The difference between an ETF and a trust, however, is that the former are open funds, and the latter are closed-ended. That means ETFs can issue new shares to meet demand, while trusts have a fixed number of shares from the outset. Trusts can also only be traded once per day at the end of the trading day in New York City. According to Grayscale data, the new XRP trust is set to close out 2024 with 300% gains for investors. 6. SEC Lawsuit Expedited Judgement For Ripple (Nov. 28) Ever since the SEC first sued Ripple Labs in Dec. 2020 for allegations of selling unregistered securities, Ripple has repeatedly prevailed against the US regulator in court. The judge over the case ruled in July 2023, for example, that secondary sales of XRP are not an investment contract and, therefore, it is not an unregistered security. Then, in Oct. 2023, the SEC dropped Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and founder Chris Larsen from their litigation, who were originally named as defendants in its multi-year lawsuit, leaving just Ripple Labs to fight in court. Finally, after getting its fine cut this August from $2 billion to $150 million, Ripple Labs won another battle on Nov. 28, when Judge Torres ruled to expedite the final judgment in the case. 7. XRP Flips BNB and Solana (Dec. 1- 2) XRP tokens traded on crypto exchanges have been racing two other altcoins neck-and-neck for the total market capitalization or market value of their economies. After flying up the price chart following Donald Trump’s reelection to the White House in November, XRP’s price managed to flip BNB (Binance Coin) in terms of total market cap on Dec. 1. Then it flipped SOL (Solana) on Dec. 2, ranking XRP the third largest cryptocurrency (excluding stablecoins) in the world, behind only Bitcoin and Ethereum. 8. XRP Notches 7-Year High Price (Dec. 2) In addition to flipping BNB and SOL tokens, XRP soared to a 7-year record high price on Dec. 2 of almost $3. That portends vigorous support for its market prices going forward as Bitcoin continues to track through its fourth quadrennial macro-market cycle based on its scheduled supply adjustments.

38258100,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=314508,1735459452,BitGo CEO Mike Belshe Predicts ‘Good Gains’ in 2025 for Bitcoin and Crypto – Here’s His Forecast,"BitGo CEO Mike Belshe says that he’s anticipating the tailwinds spurring crypto assets in 2024 will likely continue into 2025. In a new CNBC interview, Belshe says that despite the crypto industry already being bullish on the new pro-crypto administration arriving in Washington D.C., it’s possible that the new regulatory environment hasn’t been completely priced in yet. “I think the regulatory is somewhat priced in but in general we’ve seen that these news events don’t always price in until they’re actually here. So look, we have a new administration coming in, things look very promising, people are very excited, they’re very bullish. But it’s not here yet. So actually I think we’re going to continue to see the effects of that all through 2025. Remember that for the last two and a half years, we’ve had not just a regulatory environment that didn’t want to help you, we had a regulatory environment that was actively trying to kill you. So all of a sudden with that changing in the opposite direction, we’re going to continue to see good gains next year.” When asked about whether we will see more companies add Bitcoin ( BTC ) to their corporate treasuries, Belshe says “It’s absolutely going to happen.” According to the CEO, the biggest companies simply have too much cash lying around that is predictably getting debased by the increase in monetary supply – making BTC allocation a viable strategy. “We’re talking with multiple clients right now about doing that. It’s been a conversation for the last couple of years but frankly, the regulatory changes make it a lot easier. Having ETFs available makes it a lot easier. People don’t remember exactly how much balance sheet cash some of the top seven companies have. It’s hundreds of billions of dollars. So having some access to Bitcoin into that portfolio into that treasury management just makes sense. And remember it’s a hedge against whether the US can curtail inflation. And while we’re optimistic about what’s going to happen with the new administration over the next few years, America has not had a track record at all of being able to curtail spending. So if we’re going to continue to see monetary supply go up, Bitcoin is the perfect hedge against that.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $94,912.

The Travel Rule is part of the EU’s broader crypto regulation strategy and is designed to combat money laundering, the regulation mandates greater transparency in digital asset transfers by requiring cryptocurrency exchanges to collect detailed information about transactions. However, Crypto.com has preemptively implemented measures, prompting concerns about privacy and user rights. The Travel Rule will require users to disclose the names of the beneficiary parties and details about the origin of funds for both incoming and outgoing digital asset transfers. Although the regulation aims to protect against illicit activity, it disrupts the anonymity and decentralization that are fundamental to cryptocurrencies. Early Restrictions From Crypto.com Crypto.com recently introduced these compliance measures for XRP transactions, even before the Travel Rule’s official implementation date. According to screenshots shared on X by Edoardo Farina, creator of Alpha Lions Academy and prominent crypto personality, users must provide additional information about XRP deposits before their funds are credited. Farina expressed frustration on social media, stating, “Despite the ‘Travel Rule’ not taking effect until December 30, Crypto.com refused to credit my funds automatically.” Farina also questioned why such requirements were enforced for a transaction conducted within his home country on December 27, arguing that the Travel Rule specifically applies to cross-border transfers. Update: I’m back in my home country and sent 12 $XRP as a test. Despite the “Travel Rule” not taking effect until December 30, @cryptocom refused to credit my funds automatically. It’s December 27, and I’m not traveling—so why is @cryptocom already violating my rights? pic.twitter.com/agRmVQDX31 — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) December 27, 2024 His comments reflect a growing concern among crypto enthusiasts about the premature enforcement of regulatory measures and the potential overreach of centralized platforms. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Broader Problems With Centralized Exchanges These developments follow recent controversies involving major exchanges. One prominent example is Coinbase, which recently faced criticism for account restrictions and limited customer support. As centralized exchanges tighten compliance measures, proponents of decentralization argue that non-custodial wallets and decentralized exchanges are more aligned with the original ethos of cryptocurrencies. Crypto.com’s early implementation of the Travel Rule illustrates a broader trend of increasing oversight in the crypto industry. While these changes are limited to the EU, they come at a time of shifting regulatory dynamics worldwide. In the U.S., the incoming administration led by Donald Trump is widely seen as pro-crypto, and analysts expect more favorable policies that could boost the industry’s growth . With the Travel Rule’s official enforcement just days away, the coming months will likely see further debates about the implications of such regulations for the future of digital finance. After years of struggling in the U.S., the crypto market will finally be free to shine, and the U.S. could become the crypto capital of the world as Trump promised.

38257666,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376541,1735458541,Cardano Price Analysis: ADA Enters Consolidation Phase After 16% Weekly Drop,"Cardano is navigating a pivotal price range, bounded by the $0.75 and $1.3 thresholds, with its recent price action underscoring a successful pullback to the previously breached $0.75 support. The outcome of a breakout from this range will likely set the tone for its next significant market direction. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Cardano has recently encountered a rejection at the $1.3 resistance level, triggering heightened volatility and a descending retracement phase. As a result, the price settled at the $0.75 support zone, which coincides with a significant prior yearly swing high and is laden with demand and buying interest. This support has halted further downside momentum, keeping ADA confined within the $0.75-$1.3 range. This consolidation phase suggests a build-up of market pressure, with the potential for a decisive breakout on either side. A bullish breakout above $1.3 would signal the initiation of a sustained uptrend, while a bearish breakdown below $0.75 could result in a significant liquidation cascade, pushing the price toward lower support levels. The 4-Hour Chart On the shorter timeframe, Cardano’s price action has been shaped by a descending wedge pattern, a formation that often indicates a potential bullish breakout if the upper boundary is breached. Currently, the asset is hovering around the wedge’s lower boundary, near the $0.75 support zone, where increased buying interest is evident. This area is further reinforced by the critical 0.5 ($0.82)-0.618 ($0.7) Fibonacci retracement levels, solidifying it as a formidable barrier against further selling pressure. In the mid-term, ADA is anticipated to continue consolidating within this wedge pattern while maintaining its position above these key Fibonacci levels. A bullish breakout from the wedge could pave the way for an advance toward the $1.3 resistance. Conversely, a bearish breakdown below the wedge’s lower boundary might trigger a deeper decline, with the $0.5 threshold emerging as the next significant support level.

Since Bitcoin needs to fill in the gap, crypto traders predict it might push the firstborn cryptocurrency near the critical CME gap, suggesting that its price could go as low as $77,000 per coin. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Ending 2024 On A High Note?

This represents a 25% decline, aligning well with the average drop observed during this cycle,” Egrag said in a post. Egrag also noted that the current 21 Weekly EMA is around $80,000, suggesting that “another flash crash could be on the horizon.” CME Gap At $80,000 Another crypto analyst, XForceGlobal, reminded traders that “there’s a 1D CME gap at $80,000.” XForceGlobal said that historically, 90% of daily CME gaps larger than have been eventually filled since 2018. $BTC Just a friendly reminder: there’s a 1D CME gap at $80,000.

The crypto analyst sees possible scenarios to fill the CME gaps. In one scenario, XForceGlobal suggests it could be filed through a deep wave or wave-4 correction, bringing Bitcoin down to the $77,000 to $80,000 level. In another scenario, XForceGlobal said it can be filled “at a later stage via the assumed 1-2 correction after we finally finish off this bull run’s impulse,” a scenario which might result in the BTC to plummet to $46,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Head and Shoulders’ Setup Raises Fears Of $80,000 Price Drop – Details A Market Dump In January? Egrag believes that market makers might use the upcoming inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump to trigger selling pressure for Bitcoin, contributing to its imminent crash. “Market makers are known for seizing opportunities during crises. Expect a market dump on Inauguration Day (January 20, 2025). This could be the perfect local top for a sell-off, likely leaving many newcomers in a panic,” the crypto analyst said. Egrag outlined two scenarios that might unfold from the current market condition, suggesting that in one scenario, Bitcoin could pump to $120,000 and later experience a dump to the CME GAP before “resuming the bull run in 2025.” In another possible scenario, the crypto analyst said that BTC could drop to the CME gap of $70,000 to $75,000 level before the resumption of the bull run.

Prince Elon (ELONPRIN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONPRIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Prince Elon can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Prince Elon could become the next viral memecoin. Prince Elon launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Prince Elon on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Prince Elon by entering its contract address – 7rAsmWGTtPFY9RFnhd9biard7PrWtw5ZigowwfmaXUQ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONPRIN.

Accompanied by a technical analysis chart, Amonyx draws attention to a confirmed golden cross, a bullish technical indicator often associated with long-term upward momentum in asset prices. #XRP GOLDEN CROSS CONFIRMED Are you mentally prepared? pic.twitter.com/BxgNHwoSWL — Amonyx (@amonbuy) December 27, 2024 Chart Patterns and Implications The attached chart reveals key historical patterns for XRP. It shows that the asset has formed multiple accumulation phases followed by breakouts. Notably, the all-time high of $3.84 in January 2018 was followed by a prolonged consolidation period that lasted several years. The price remained subdued in a wide range, struggling to break past significant resistance levels. The chart highlights two primary green-shaded zones representing extended periods of consolidation. Both instances culminated in sharp price movements when XRP successfully broke out of its range. The most recent breakout has helped XRP to surpass critical resistance levels and reach $2.86, the highest price since its 2018 all-time high. The asset is trading at $2.15, but these bullish signs suggest an imminent rise, potentially surpassing its 2024 peak of $2.86. Amonyx also points to the formation of a golden cross , a technical event when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average. This indicator is traditionally interpreted as a sign of potential sustained bullish momentum. In this context, it reinforces optimism surrounding XRP’s trajectory. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Reasons to Be Bullish About XRP While the focus of the post and chart is technical, the crypto market’s broader developments cannot be ignored. Ripple’s legal challenges with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have long held XRP down. However, recent political changes could shift the regulatory sentiment. Gary Gensler, the current SEC Chair, has announced his resignation , effective January 20, 2025. President-elect Donald Trump’s nomination of Paul Atkins, a figure perceived as more favorable to crypto, has fueled speculation about regulatory relief for Ripple and similar entities. The sentiment within the crypto community is overwhelmingly bullish, as reflected in Amonyx’s enthusiastic post and the community’s reactions. The digital asset’s confirmed golden cross and recent breakout above the $2 level are significant events. These developments align with a broader narrative of optimism, and the asset could experience a massive rally sooner than many expect.

Meanwhile, the innovative Remittix (RTX) continues its meteoric rise, fueled by groundbreaking payment solutions and strong investor demand. Will WIF and BONK stray from their bearish tendencies, or is RTX going to be the next 100x altcoin in the crypto market? Read on to explore why these top altcoins are the focus of market excitement and which one might provide the most returns in 2025. Is Bonk (BONK) Poised for a Breakout? With an amazing 18% increase over the previous week, the Bonk coin is causing waves in the meme coin market . The weekly Bonk price chart shows, however, that this recovery happened inside a protracted consolidation phase between $0.000028 and $0.000035. The past month presented a bleak picture for Bonk holders despite this temporary rise; the Bonk price dropped by nearly 22% and tested the $0.000025 support level. Positive momentum started to show close to this important support zone, driving the Bonk coin back above $0.000030 and inspiring hope among holders. Although the Bonk price is still erratic, the community sentiment toward the memecoin has remained bullish. On November 20, Bonk reached an all-time high (ATH) of $0.000059; holders are now excitedly awaiting another ATH, possibly by January 2025. With Moving Averages showing a positive long-term trend on the Bonk price chart, the sell indications of the Momentum Oscillator advise caution. Can Dogwifhat (WIF) Bounce Back to ATH? The Dogwifhat price moved very little during the past week, rising by less than 1% as it consolidated between $2.28 and $1.78. Although there was little weekly movement throughout this time of massive consolidation, the prior month was notable for steep Dogwifhat price falls. The meme coin has plummeted around 40% in the past 30 days, according to the Dogwifhat price chart , which reflects a bearish trend. Notwithstanding these obstacles, public opinion of Dogwifhat (WIF) is still very positive; many predict a comeback and a possible all-time high (ATH) by Q1 2025. Although the Dogwifhat price is right now more than 60% below its ATH, its location on a significant bullish trendline on the annual chart makes it one of the promising altcoins to watch . As this meme coin tries to rebuild lost momentum, investors are closely monitoring it. Still, care is urged as on the Dogwifhat price chart both Oscillators and Moving Averages show bearish signals . Dogwifhat is an interesting prospect in the meme coin market for those ready to take a measured risk because of its great community support and the possibility for a major breakout in the near future.

Remittix is ready to challenge worldwide payments and provide great value for early investors as analysts project possible 100x gains in this bull run. Remittix Set To Outpace Dogwifhat and Bonk The market’s focus moves to the emerging star, Remittix (RTX) as Dogwifhat (WIF) and Bonk (BONK) struggle with recent price declines. Remittix is transforming global banking with its unique payment solutions and the deflationary RTX token. While WIF and BONK holders wait for their coins to rebound and hit possible all-time highs, smart investors are locking in RTX at its presale price of just $0.0163, grabbing a unique chance to ride the wave of what analysts project may be a 100x rally in this bull run.

According to the blockchain data tracker, a Bitcoin (BTC) whale hibernating for the past 11 years has suddenly become active. Whale Alert says the whale’s address contains 357 BTC, which, based on current market value, is worth over $35,397,300. The reactivation of the whale’s wallet has drawn significant attention in the broader cryptocurrency space. Whale Acquired Bitcoin at less than $1,000 Primarily, this whale was last active in 2013, which is 4 years after the launch of Bitcoin. Undoubtedly, the whale was an early adopter of the digital asset. 💤 💤 💤 💤 A dormant address containing 357 #BTC (34,070,177 USD) has just been activated after 11.0 years! https://t.co/1f851lxAYl — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) December 29, 2024 When those coins were acquired, Bitcoin was less than $1,000. The prevailing price ranged between $13 and $187 for the greater part of the year. Around November, BTC soared from $187 to the $776 level. The highest price of BTC in 2013 was $1,046. Activating this old wallet, which was last active when BTC traded less than $1,000, has sparked curiosity about the owner’s intention. Notably, it could suggest that the whale has decided to sell part of its holdings or move the coin. Market experts opine that usually, such a long stretch of dormancy might have been due to loss of access to the wallet. So, for the whale to have woken from its slumber it implies they regained access to the wallet’s private keys. Whale’s Profit Margin Highlights Bitcoin’s Growth Although the actual reason for the reactivation remains unknown, the move has sparked discussions in the crypto market. Many have highlighted the huge growth Bitcoin has recorded in price within the past 11 years. The asset’s value has skyrocketed, leaving the whale with over $35 million in profit. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $94,471.31, a 0.05% increase in the last 24 hours. The asset has battled market fluctuation in the last seven days as it tries again to breach the $100,000 without success. This has fuelled ‘Buy the Dip’ sentiments in some quarters. Analysts Make Bold 2025 Bitcoin Projections Despite Bitcoin’s price resistance, the Blockware Solutions market report is projecting gains for Bitcoin in 2025. It pegs Bitcoin to soar by 58% to $150,000 even if other favorable macroeconomic factors fail to occur. However, if expectations play out, BTC might hit $400,000.

Thorn noted that the government would instead maintain its Bitcoin reserves while discussions about a Bitcoin reserve policy continue. Exploring a Bitcoin Reserve Policy “There will be some movement within the departments and agencies to examine an expanded Bitcoin reserve policy,” Thorn said. Currently, the US government holds 183,850 BTC, valued at approximately $17.36 billion, spread across various known addresses, according to Spot on Chain. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis has proposed the Bitcoin Act 2024, which, if enacted, would allow the US to include Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. This would involve purchasing 200,000 BTC annually for five years, accumulating 1 million Bitcoin to be held for at least 20 years. Nation-State Competition for Bitcoin Galaxy analyst “JW” predicted that up to five Nasdaq 100 companies and five nation-states might add Bitcoin to their balance sheets or sovereign wealth funds. He suggested that increased US involvement in Bitcoin could trigger a competitive rush among nations to mine or acquire Bitcoin. “Competition among nation states, particularly unaligned nations, those with large sovereign wealth funds, or even those adversarial to the United States, will drive the adoption of strategies to mine or otherwise acquire Bitcoin,” JW explained. Global Perspectives on Bitcoin Reserves On Dec. 26, Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed uncertainty about the US and other countries adopting Bitcoin reserves, stating, “It is difficult for the government to express its views.” Meanwhile, former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao suggested that China might adopt a strategic Bitcoin reserve. At the Bitcoin MENA conference in Abu Dhabi on Dec. 9, Zhao said smaller countries would likely lead in adopting Bitcoin reserves, albeit at a gradual pace.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | RESEARCH | BNB,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/galaxy-digital-us-unlikely-to-buy-bitcoin-in-2025-but-may-expand-reserve-policy/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
38257457,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53362,1735454560,XRP to $27.5? XRP Linear Regression Shows Time and Target Projections,"A recent analysis by EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto), a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency space, has provided a detailed outlook into XRP’s future trajectory using a linear regression channel on a logarithmic scale. This method captures approximately 68% of price movements within a defined trend, offering valuable insights into market behavior. Linear regression is a powerful analytical tool that helps identify key price levels, reversal points, and overall market trends. It uses a central trendline alongside upper and lower bands to define potential overbought and oversold zones. Prices often revert to the mean over time, a phenomenon referred to as mean reversion, which makes this tool particularly useful in predicting price movements. #XRP Linear Regression: Time & Target Projections ($6.4, $8.5 or $13.7, $27.5 – March Or November 2025): Key Features of the Linear Regression Channel (Log Scale): Brief Overview: Linear Regression with (-/+1 Standard Deviation) creates a channel around the trendline that… pic.twitter.com/mzS0mOpHJO — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 27, 2024 XRP Milestones in 2025 EGRAG CRYPTO’s analysis projects significant milestones for XRP by 2025. By March, he expects the price to reach approximately $6.4, which aligns closely with the Fibonacci 1.618 retracement level on the lower scale he marked in green. Beyond this level, a potential breakout could push the price to $8.5, associated with the Fibonacci 1.272 retracement level on the higher scale marked in white. This level is close to the $8 target he recently predicted for the digital asset. These targets represent significant growth and are supported by historical price behavior within the regression channel. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The analyst also identified an intermediate price of $4.4 as an important milestone in this upward movement. This figure aligns with the Fibonacci 1.414 on the lower scale. While $4.4 is notable, EGRAG CRYPTO’s analysis suggests that XRP can exceed this level. He also discusses the possibility of a cycle blow-off top, where XRP could reach prices between $13.7 and $27.5. This range corresponds to Fibonacci levels 1.414 and 1.618 on the higher scale, indicating a peak in bullish activity. EGARAG CRYPTO identifies November 2025 as another critical time frame for these upper price levels, suggesting that XRP’s price action will be heavily influenced by broader market trends and sentiment during this period. EGRAG CRYPTO emphasizes that price action typically leads market narratives, highlighting the importance of analyzing technical indicators to anticipate potential developments. This forward-looking perspective shows the significance of using tools like linear regression and Fibonacci levels to understand market dynamics. In addition to EGRAG CRYPTO’s opinion, many prominent analysts have weighed in on XRP’s future, sharing bullish expectations for the digital asset.

It’s difficult to predict if this pattern will break to the upside or downside, but this type of consolidation is often a precursor to a major move in either direction. Currently, the price is staying within a defined range, and the market is trying to determine its next move. Sideways action may feel boring, but it’s a healthy market behavior, allowing the price to gather strength before pushing higher. As long as XRP holds above key support levels, especially the $2.04 price level, the bullish trend remains intact. A breakout above this consolidation phase could send XRP to test higher levels, with $3 being a potential next resistance level, and even higher towards the all-time highs. Price Levels to Watch $2.04 Support : This is a critical level for XRP. If the price holds above this level, the bullish scenario remains intact. A drop below $2.04 would invalidate the short-term bullish outlook and open the door for a bearish reversal. $3 Resistance : If the price moves higher, $3 will be an important resistance zone. A successful breakout above this level could pave the way for XRP to reach its all-time high. Bearish Scenario If XRP breaks below the $2.04 level, the bearish scenario becomes more likely. In this case, the price could move lower, targeting the support zone between $1.8 and $1.79. A sustained drop below $2.04 would suggest that the market is preparing for a larger correction, and further downside could follow.

The digital asset mimics a correction structure seen in a four-hour time frame, now reflected on the daily chart. If this structure holds, the correction is expected to conclude within the next ten days. Hi all. I hope you all are fine. XRP mimics the correction structure, similar to a 4-hour time frame. If true, the correction will be completed within ±10 Days on the daily structure. In Patreon, we have gone through the details and called this a Bull Flag on the Weekly Chart… pic.twitter.com/e3w7LPhWo6 — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) December 27, 2024 Dark Defender has classified the ongoing correction as part of a larger bullish setup. In early December, he identified this pattern as a bull flag. This formation, commonly associated with strong upward momentum, targets an initial price of $8.67 after completion. However, before aiming for this ambitious target, XRP must complete the current corrections on the daily chart. As of December 26, XRP found significant support at $2.13. At press time, the asset was still trading at that level. The analyst described this development as a positive sign for the token’s momentum. Trendlines and Fibonacci retracement levels currently align, providing traders with a clearer view of the market’s potential movements. Key Levels to Watch The analysis emphasizes the importance of specific support and resistance levels in guiding XRP’s trajectory. The critical support levels to monitor include $2.03, $2.11, $2.13, and $2.17. The digital asset formed this support after its recent rise above its 2021 peak of $1.96 in early December, and the support has formed an upward trendline under the digital asset’s price movements. Meanwhile, resistance levels are identified at $2.22, $2.42, and $2.69. The resistance forms a downward trendline to complete a symmetrical triangle on the digital asset’s price chart. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Breaking through the resistance at $2.69 is pivotal for XRP to move toward its long-term target. Conversely, maintaining support above $2.03 is essential to avoid a deeper retracement that could hinder bullish momentum. Can XRP Reach $8.67? The market outlook for XRP remains optimistic, provided it adheres to the outlined support and resistance thresholds. The daily correction phase appears necessary for the token to consolidate before advancing. XRP is expected to continue its bullish trajectory, with the daily correction phase as a temporary consolidation period. Another analyst recently predicted a rise to $8 for XRP, and if the outlined conditions are met, the asset is likely to aim for higher price targets soon.

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE.

This bullish outlook for the flagship crypto came as crypto analyst Tony Severino revealed a potential Doji formation, which suggested that BTC could enjoy this uptrend in the new year. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Head and Shoulders’ Setup Raises Fears Of $80,000 Price Drop – Details Doji Formation Could Lead To New Year Bitcoin Price Rally In an X post, Severino suggested that a Doji formation could lead to a Bitcoin price rally in the first two months of the new year. The analyst mentioned that he suspects BTC will end December with the Doji and then January shows a strong continuation for the flagship crypto. His accompanying chart showed that this strong continuation could extend into February. The crypto analyst explained that a Doji represents a pause in the market due to indecision from buyers and sellers. He added that the following candlestick shows market participants the decision the market has made through strong continuation or a reversal. In this case, Severino expects that the following candlestick will show a strong continuation for the Bitcoin price. Severino noted that a similar Doji at similar subwaves each resulted in two more months of upside before a local top was in for the Bitcoin price. Therefore, the crypto could enjoy two months of upside between January and February 2025 if history repeats itself. From a fundamental perspective, Donald Trump’s inauguration is one factor that could spark this strong continuation. The BTC price rallied above $100,000 after Trump’s victory in the November US presidential elections. As such, the flagship crypto could continue this rally as Trump becomes the first pro-crypto US president. Moreover, the US president-elect may create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve when he takes office, which would provide more bullish momentum for BTC. BTC Needs To Hold Above $92,730 In an X post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez remarked that the Bitcoin price needs to avoid dipping below $92,730, as if that level breaks, it will be in free-fall territory. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that Bitcoin could drop to the $70,000 range if it breaks this $92,730 price level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Surge: Are Traders Preparing For A Major Market Shift? However, in another X post, Martinez suggested that such a Bitcoin price drop might not necessarily be bad.

Meanwhile, Martinez stated that the invalidation levels for his bearish Bitcoin outlook are a sustained close above $97,300 and a daily close above $100,000.

38254251,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53353,1735450209,"Hedera Pursues Glory With AI Innovation NVIDIA, Chainlink & Rollblock’s Not Far Behind","The Hedera price is surging upwards following news of its partnership with Nvidia and Chainlink . While both HBAR and LINK prices are set to benefit greatly, the new AI-driven GambleFi protocol Rollblock (RBLK) is predicted to beat the two altcoins effortlessly. Let’s dig into why analysts tout RBLK as the best crypto investment of 2025 that could deliver staggering yields north of 50x. Rollblock (RBLK) is set to disrupt online casino markets with AI This Ethereum-based gambling protocol is turning the massive gambling empire on its head with a blockchain-powered, AI-driven GambleFi ecosystem. The iGaming juggernaut employs AI technology to support advanced betting strategies and copy-betting player initiatives, giving more competitive odds to players than other casino platforms. Furthermore, all gaming activity is posted on-chain, offering full transparency to players’ bets and transactions. Thus, no one can alter bets, injecting credibility into the infamous gambling industry. Things get even more alluring on the investment side. The iGaming platform pays weekly dividends to investors from a share of its profits, with RBLK token holders staking their coins earning up to 30% APY! Disrupting even a tiny share of the $540 billion casino market will be sufficient to make Rollblock a multibillion iGaming protocol on Ethereum, pushing the RBLK market cap to billions. That will spark a parabolic price action for the RBLK token, with analysts predicting it could surge 880% in presale and potentially blast past 50x on the launch! Hedera price up over 100% monthly Hedera price (HBAR) is on the fly. HBAR was up 106% month-to-date, pushing its yearly gains past 221%. That spectacular performance comes amid Hedera’s partnership with tech giant Nvidia and blockchain oracle Chainklink to power the development of enterprise AI applications and ensure secure data feeds and tokenization of real-world assets. These new developments are expected to enhance the platform’s appeal for developers and institutions, driving broader adoption of the Hedera network. As of press time, HBAR was trading with a slight pullback in the $0.28 zone. CoinCodex data shows it might surge over 196% to hit $0.86 by August 2025, making HBAR an attractive crypto investment . Chainlink (LINK) could surpass its ATH in 2025 Chainlink is the largest data oracle that feeds secure and reliable data to DeFi applications running smart contracts. Its recent partnership with Hedera underscores its vital role within the blockchain ecosystem, positioning LINK as a top crypto investment for value-oriented investors. In its recent upshot, LINK hit $30 before pulling back in the past weeks to hover in the $23 zone. At the current price, LINK was only up 29% monthly, bringing its year-to-date returns to 52%. Given its solid fundamentals, analysts believe LINK could be undervalued, and the altcoin is expected to push upward in 2025. LINK ‘s community sentiment was 89% bullish, and CoinCodex data reveals it could hit $85 by May 2025, pulling a 260% yield. Which is the best crypto investment: HBAR, LINK, or RBLK? HBAR and LINK are already established crypto assets and their large market caps limit their upside potential. However, RBLK is a new crypto gem that analysts believe is greatly undervalued at the $0.044 price, and analysts believe it’s one of the best crypto investment s.

38253576,https://nulltx.com/?p=137137,1735449345,Invest In These 5 Best Meme Coins For Exponential Returns as One of Them Goes Viral With BIG50 Bonus Offer,"The cryptocurrency market is always buzzing with action, but 2024 has taken meme coins to a whole new level. From playful tokens to serious players, these coins are dominating conversations. With the rise of innovative features and creative communities, meme coins are no longer just a joke; they’re now serious contenders in the investment game. For anyone looking to ride the wave of crypto hype, meme coins are worth a look. But how do you choose the best meme coins for exponential returns in a market so crowded? Enter BTFD Coin (BTFD), a trailblazer in the meme coin ecosystem that’s redefining the genre. With its electrifying presale, innovative staking rewards, and a Play-to-Earn game that’s turning heads, BTFD is creating excitement like never before. Moreover, with its BIG50 code offering 50% extra $BTFD coins, it’s the meme coin to watch. But BTFD isn’t alone in this space. Let’s dive into the five hottest meme coins that are grabbing headlines and could make you rethink your investment strategy. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD): Redefining the Meme Coin Revolution When it comes to meme coins that pack a punch, BTFD Coin is leading the charge. With its presale breaking records and a community that’s rallying around its bold vision, BTFD Coin is one of the best meme coins for exponential returns this year. Let’s break it down. BTFD Coin is more than just a catchy acronym. It stands for “Buy The Dip,” a rallying cry for crypto enthusiasts who know the value of seizing opportunities during market downturns. Its presale launched at a humble $0.000004 per coin, but it’s now in Stage 13 at $0.00013, with over $4.6 million raised and more than 60 billion coins sold to over 7,000 holders. And with a listing price set at $0.0006, there’s massive potential for growth. One of BTFD’s standout features is its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, which made its beta version live during Stage 10 of the presale. While the beta version doesn’t offer rewards yet, it’s a sneak peek at what’s to come. The game, combined with a robust 90% APY staking programme and an exclusive Referral Programme, has created a buzz that’s hard to ignore. Let’s not forget the Bulls Squad, a dedicated community driving engagement and spreading the word about this powerhouse coin. Why did this coin make it to this list? BTFD Coin’s presale success, unique features, and the promise of exponential returns put it at the top of the list. If you’re looking to jump in, visit the presale page, connect your wallet, enter the bonus code BIG50, and grab 50% extra $BTFD coins before the deal expires on January 5th. 2. Book of Meme (BOME): The Literary Wonder of Meme Coins In a sea of meme coins, Book of Meme (BOME) stands out with its narrative-driven approach. Instead of just riding trends, BOME has built an entire ecosystem around storytelling, blending humour with community-driven lore. It’s a unique twist that’s resonating with a growing fanbase. BOME has launched a series of collectible NFTs tied to chapters of its fictional universe. These aren’t just digital trinkets; they’re integral to the coin’s ecosystem, offering holders perks like staking bonuses and early access to exclusive content. The team behind BOME is also rolling out an educational campaign, teaching newcomers about crypto through bite-sized memes. Think of it as a crash course in decentralised finance with a side of laughter. BOME’s value proposition lies in its strong focus on community. By fostering a sense of belonging through storytelling and interactive content, it’s creating a sticky user base. Investors aren’t just buying tokens; they’re becoming part of a larger narrative, which is why BOME’s popularity is skyrocketing. Why did this coin make it to this list? Book of Meme offers a unique blend of creativity and functionality, making it more than just another meme coin. It’s capturing imaginations while offering real-world utility, a rare combo that promises exponential returns. 3. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The OG That Keeps Surprising No list of the best meme coins for exponential returns is complete without Shiba Inu. It’s the granddaddy of modern meme coins, having carved out a niche that few others can match. What started as a joke has become a robust ecosystem, complete with its own decentralised exchange (ShibaSwap), an NFT collection, and even plans for a metaverse. Shiba Inu’s strength lies in its ability to pivot and adapt. While its early days were all about riding the Dogecoin hype, it’s now focusing on creating value for its holders. ShibaSwap, for example, allows users to stake their SHIB tokens, earn rewards, and participate in governance. The recent launch of Shibarium, a Layer 2 blockchain, aims to reduce transaction fees and improve scalability—key factors for long-term growth. The SHIB Army, as its community is affectionately called, plays a huge role in its success. This is a group of die-hard fans who’ve taken it upon themselves to promote, educate, and build on Shiba Inu’s ecosystem. Their commitment is a testament to the power of community in crypto. Why did this coin make it to this list? Shiba Inu’s proven track record, innovative projects, and dedicated community make it a no-brainer for anyone seeking exponential returns in the meme coin market. 4. Neiro (NEIRO): The Futuristic Meme Coin Neiro is shaking things up with its AI-driven features. It’s the first meme coin to integrate artificial intelligence into its core operations, promising a future where meme coins aren’t just for laughs but also for smart investments. At its heart, Neiro uses AI algorithms to predict market trends and provide holders with actionable insights. This isn’t just pie-in-the-sky tech; early adopters have reported significant gains by leveraging these insights. Neiro is also exploring partnerships with blockchain gaming companies, aiming to create an ecosystem where its token is the default currency for in-game transactions. What’s particularly exciting about Neiro is its focus on sustainability. Unlike many meme coins that rely on hype, Neiro is building a foundation for long-term growth. Its developers are transparent, its roadmap is ambitious but realistic, and its community is growing organically—no bots, just real people. Why did this coin make it to this list? Neiro’s innovative use of AI, focus on sustainability, and potential for exponential returns make it a standout in the meme coin universe. 5. Bonk (BONK): Solana’s Meme Coin Darling Bonk is Solana’s answer to Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. It’s the first meme coin on the Solana blockchain, and it’s making waves with its lightning-fast transactions and ultra-low fees. If you’ve ever been frustrated by Ethereum’s high gas fees, Bonk might just be your ticket to meme coin heaven. What sets Bonk apart is its community-first approach. The coin was airdropped to thousands of Solana users, creating an instant buzz and a broad holder base. This strategy has not only increased its adoption but also strengthened its community. Bonk’s developers are also committed to building tools and resources for creators, adding utility to what’s traditionally been a hype-driven market. Bonk’s roadmap includes plans for decentralised applications (dApps) and a unique staking mechanism that rewards long-term holders. While it’s still early days, the coin’s performance so far suggests it’s got staying power. Why did this coin make it to this list? Bonk’s innovative use of the Solana blockchain, combined with its community-first ethos, makes it a strong contender for exponential returns in 2024 and beyond. Why Buying the Dip Matters If history has taught us anything, it’s that economic downturns are ripe with opportunities. Take 1973, for instance. The global economy took a massive hit, yet those who invested wisely during the crash came out on top. The same logic applies today. In a market that’s anything but stable, buying the dip—or investing during bearish trends—can set you up for monumental gains. That’s where BTFD Coin comes in. Designed for those who see opportunity in chaos, it’s the perfect meme coin for these turbulent times. With its presale blazing past expectations and features like high-yield staking, P2E gaming, and an engaging Referral Programme, BTFD is built for investors who know the value of acting now. Conclusion The meme coin universe is buzzing with energy, creativity, and innovation, making it an irresistible space for crypto enthusiasts seeking exponential returns. Whether it’s BTFD Coin redefining presales with its insane features, Book of Meme pushing decentralisation boundaries, Shiba Inu proving the staying power of community-driven projects, Neiro tapping into AI-powered potential, or Bonk keeping Solana alive and kicking with fun, these coins showcase the best of what’s possible in the meme coin ecosystem. Head over to the BTFD presale page and claim your 50% extra $BTFD coins using the bonus code BIG50.

38253156,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=667857,1735448428,Toncoin Price Recovery Continues — Is The Dwindling Staking TVL Ratio Bullish?,"The Toncoin price recovery has been one of the few bright spots in the cryptocurrency market over the past week. The climate of the broad market has been sluggish in the festive period, with the two largest assets Bitcoin and Ethereum struggling to make a mark. With the Toncoin price now approaching the $6 mark, it appears that the altcoin is now fully in its recovery phase. According to a pseudonymous analyst, a recent on-chain phenomenon suggests that the price rally for TON is only just beginning. What Happened Last Time TON Staking TVL Ratio Was At A Low Level? In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, an analyst with the pseudonym Joaowedson discussed the dynamics between the staking TVL ratio and Toncoin price. According to the analyst, there is a correlation between the amount locked on TON and price movements. Related Reading: Historical Data Shows What To Expect From Ethereum Price In Q1 2025 – It’s Very Bullish The Quicktake analyst highlighted a trend whereby investors withdraw their assets in order to explore trading opportunities whenever there is a price increase. This phenomenon has also been observed in the TON ecosystem, with the TVL metric dropping in recent weeks. Joaowedson noted that the staking TVL ratio has reached new lows, coinciding with what appears to be a bottom for the price of Toncoin. Ultimately, this suggests that the odds of an increase in the Toncoin price are higher. While the idea of reduced interest in staking leading to price growth seems counterintuitive, it can be justified by the increase in liquidity available for trading. The Quicktake analyst explained: When investors withdraw funds from staking, they often transfer them to exchanges for quick trades. This movement increases demand for the token, driving prices higher. From a historical perspective, a similar situation occurred in March 2024 when the staking TVL ratio shrunk significantly as the TON price soared to new highs. “Interestingly, as interest in staking diminished, funds started migrating to centralized exchanges (CEX) and decentralized exchanges (DEX) like Ston.FI and Dedust, boosting the TVL in those categories,” Joaowedson added. With investors more willing to make their assets available for trading, there is a higher likelihood of price increases due to growing demand. If this holds true, the Toncoin price could return to around its recent highs. Toncoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the Toncoin price stands at around $5.78, reflecting a 0.5% decline in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the value of TON is up by more than 6% on the weekly timeframe.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-cyborg-trumpcyb-solana-memecoin-to-rally-over-15000-before-exchange-listing-while-bonk-and-dogecoin-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

38251949,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634411,1735445689,Traditional banks tap into the billion-dollar stablecoin market to rival Tether’s dominance,"Traditional banks such as Societe Generale, Standard Chartered, and Revolut are now reaching for a slice of Tether’s dominance of the stablecoin market. The opportunity became especially apparent after Tether’s decision to discontinue its EURt stablecoin. For years, Tether Holdings has led the charge of stablecoins reshaping the global finance space. However, as traditional finance increasingly opens up to the crypto space, banks are also making the move to test the stablecoin issuance waters. Bloomberg reported that these banks will be looking to fill the chasm created as Tether Holdings discontinues its EURt stablecoin. Tether launched the EURt stablecoin in 2016. However, unlike the firm’s leading product USDT, the EURt failed to meet expectations and struggled to gain traction after its launch. Its market capitalization declined to an almost irrelevant figure of $37M compared to USDT’s market cap of over $138B. Tether Holdings announced in November that it will discontinue the EURt stablecoin in accordance with the new Market in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations in Europe. All aboard the stablecoin train Tether’s $10B in net profits has proven to be a major incentive for traditional banks, who are wasting no time in making their moves. Societe Generale-Forge (SG-Forge) has already launched a Euro-backed stablecoin ( EURCV ) and opened the product to retail investors. Oddo BHF , BBVA , and Revolut are exploring releasing their versions of euro-denominated stablecoins. AllUnity also plans to issue another euro-based stablecoin next year. MiCA has provided a clear regulatory framework for stablecoins and crypto assets in the EU, making it easy for companies and banks to issue their stablecoins. This clarity also created an allowance for competition in the stablecoin market, especially as Tether continues to drag its feet with meeting all the standards of the new European regulation. Jean-Marc Stenger, CEO of SG-FORGE, confirmed that multiple banks are in discussions to use its stablecoin technology either through partnerships or white-label deals. Banks in the US are lagging behind as there is no legislation in place that allows for the issuance of stablecoins. They are however expected to swarm the market once the legislation is passed. The global surge of stablecoins Traditional banks aren’t the only companies riding the stablecoin wave. Visa launched a tokenization network to ease the issuance of stablecoins. BBVA is among the banks piloting Visa’s technology, and it’s in discussions with many other banks as well. Cuy Sheffield, the head of crypto at Visa, confirmed in an interview with Bloomberg that they have received offers from banks in Singapore, Brazil and Hong Kong. “We are actively engaged with a number of banks across the world at various stages of the process,” he said. Standard Chartered partnered with Animoca Brands Ltd. and Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd., and was selected as one of the first issuers of HKD-denominated stablecoins in an experimental program. JPMorgan Chase has been exploring deposit tokens which are similar to stablecoins but are tied to bank accounts. The deposit tokens have limitations that can be offset by the use of stablecoins, allowing banks to leverage blockchain technology to overcome some of the inherent challenges in traditional banking systems. However, the use of stablecoins comes with its own set of challenges for banks. A European Central Bank analysis showed that converting retail deposits into stablecoin reserves could weaken liquidity coverage ratios, compromising banks’ ability to meet short-term obligations during turbulent periods. US regulators would also need to clarify what counts as acceptable reserves and whether stablecoin deposits will be insured to avoid user panic. The rise of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) is also an issue as it threatens bank-issued stablecoins for wholesale payments and other use cases. Even with these hurdles, Tether is sitting on a $10B gold mine, and banks seem to believe the stablecoin headache is a problem worth having.

Chart Pattern To Trigger Dogecoin Price Crash A TradingView analyst known as ‘Cryptechcapital’ has shared a chart representing an Elliott Wave analysis of Dogecoin’s price movements on a long-term weekly time frame. While the analyst has provided a detailed report on Dogecoin’s present Elliott Wave structure, he has identified the formation of a textbook Cup and Handle pattern. Related Reading: Historical Data Shows What To Expect From Ethereum Price In Q1 2025 – It’s Very Bullish A Cup and Handle pattern is a technical indicator that signals a period of consolidation before a breakout. While it is typically considered a bullish signal that extends an uptrend, the crypto analyst has noted that its appearance in Dogecoin‘s chart points to a significant price correction to new lows. The analyst’s Dogecoin price chart outlines a 5-wave impulse structure from 1 to 5. Dogecoin is currently at Wave 4, a correction wave, where prices retrace and move sideways for a prolonged period. The handle of the Cup and Handle pattern also corresponds with Wave 4 of Dogecoin’s 5-wave structure. In the immediate term, the TradingVolume analyst has predicted a significant Dogecoin price crash once it completes Wave 4. He suggested that if the Cup and Handle pattern holds, Dogecoin may experience downward pressure over the next week. The analyst also added that the broader cryptocurrency market might face similar bearish headwinds, particularly with the rising market volatility and Bitcoin’s declining price. While the exact levels of the analyst’s projected decline are not specified, Wave 4 corrections are usually known to retrace significant portions of the previous Wave 3 gains. This means that if Dogecoin experiences a price decline during Wave 4, a potential dip below $0.2 could be possible. Dogecoin Crash First, Recovery Next? While Cryptechcapital has predicted a significant price crash for Dogecoin, he also asserts that this anticipated correction could pave the way for a powerful rebound. The TradingView analyst revealed that after the completion of Wave 4, Dogecoin is expected to enter Wave 5, signaling the end of its bearish phase and the beginning of a potential price rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Retests Support Line After Crash Below $95,000, Here’s The Next Target As mentioned above, the Cup and Handle pattern often signals the final consolidation phase before a price breakout. The TradingView analyst has predicted that Dogecoin could undergo a severe price crash before triggering a price recovery to the coveted $1 mark. The analyst’s price chart also highlights that if Dogecoin achieves a local high instead of continuing its projected correction, the Cup and Handle pattern will be invalidated. This development would require a new forecast for Dogecoin’s price trajectory.

The stories of people who turned a few hundred dollars into life-changing wealth haunt every crypto enthusiast who joined too late. One such recent example is Turbo (TURBO), a meme coin that started as a joke but ended up delivering staggering returns. If you missed the Turbo train, don’t worry. History is offering a second chance in the form of BTFD Coin’s top crypto presale . Meme coins have carved out a niche in the crypto world, delivering massive gains to savvy investors who get in early. Now, BTFD Coin is set to redefine this trend with its unique offerings: a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, a 90% staking APY, and an innovative referral programme. Add to this its festive price rollback to Stage 7 rates, and it’s clear that BTFD Coin is a chance no investor should ignore. BTFD Coin: Your Chance to Seize the Dip For those unfamiliar, BTFD represents “ Buy The Dip ,” a rallying cry for crypto enthusiasts looking to profit from market downturns. BTFD Coin’s presale began at $0.000004 per token and has already scampered to Stage 13, priced at $0.000014—an 837.5% ROI for early adopters. But here’s the kicker: for a limited time, investors can grab BTFD tokens with a 50% bonus by using the code BIG50. Features Setting BTFD Apart: Play-to-Earn Game: The beta version of BTFD’s P2E game went live in Stage 10, allowing users to engage with the ecosystem while preparing for future rewards. 90% APY on Staking: Staking went live on December 2, offering investors a secure way to grow their holdings. Referral Programme: Earn 10% of raised funds in BTFD tokens by promoting the presale, with additional rewards for leaderboard positions. Bulls Squad Community: A vibrant community fostering collaboration and market insights. Imagine this: investing $5,000 in Stage 12 at $0.000013 per coin would yield approximately 78.125 million tokens. When BTFD lists at $0.0006 post-presale, your $5,000 could balloon to $46,875—an ROI of nearly 837.5%. BTFD’s unique roadmap ensures sustained interest and utility. Its tokenomics, including locked liquidity and community rewards, provide stability while incentivising long-term holding. With over $4.6 million raised and 60 billion coins sold, this is shaping up to be one of the year’s hottest presales . Turbo (TURBO): The Meme Coin You Missed Turbo, a meme coin launched in 2024, has captivated investors with its quirky branding and rapid adoption. Initially priced at fractions of a cent, Turbo soared to $0.00997 following its Coinbase listing. Investors who spotted the opportunity early walked away with massive gains, while latecomers were left wishing they had acted sooner. Turbo’s rise is a testament to the power of community-driven projects. Its unique marketing campaigns and high-profile exchange listings propelled it to meme coin stardom. However, like many meme coins, Turbo remains highly volatile. After reaching its peak, its value dipped to $0.0089, reflecting the speculative nature of the market. For those who missed out on Turbo’s early stages, the regret is palpable. But there’s no need to dwell on the past. The lessons learned from Turbo’s success can be applied to BTFD Coin, which is currently in its presale phase and poised for a significant post-launch rally. Why BTFD Stands Out While Turbo dazzled with its rapid price appreciation, BTFD offers a more robust value proposition. Turbo’s appeal was primarily driven by hype and community support, whereas BTFD combines meme coin charm with tangible utility. BTFD’s P2E game and high APY staking programme provide real-world benefits, making it more than just a speculative asset. Moreover, the ongoing presale allows investors to enter at a discounted price, maximising potential returns. Analysts predict BTFD’s listing price of $0.0006 could deliver exponential gains, making it a compelling alternative for those who missed Turbo’s meteoric rise. Join the BTFD Presale Before It’s Too Late! Seizing this opportunity is as simple as following these steps: Visit the BTFD Coin Presale Page . Connect your wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet). Put the bonus code BIG50 . Specify the amount of BTFD you wish to purchase. Confirm the transaction and secure your bonus tokens. With the presale ending soon, there’s no time to waste. Early investors have already reaped significant rewards, and the next wave of gains could be yours. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Your Second Chance If you’ve ever regretted not investing in a promising project like Turbo during its early stages, consider this your wake-up call. BTFD Coin’s top crypto presale is a golden opportunity to secure tokens at a discounted price and ride the wave of its post-launch success. With its P2E game, staking rewards, and community-driven growth, BTFD Coin is more than a meme—it’s a movement. Act now to claim your share of the future. Use the code BIG50 to get the bonus and seize the dip before it’s too late. The bulls are charging, and you don’t want to be left in the dust.

Prince Elon (ELONPRIN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONPRIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Prince Elon can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Prince Elon could become the next viral memecoin. Prince Elon launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Prince Elon on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Prince Elon by entering its contract address – 7rAsmWGTtPFY9RFnhd9biard7PrWtw5ZigowwfmaXUQ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONPRIN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/prince-elon-elonprin-solana-memecoin-to-surge-13000-before-exchange-listing-as-shiba-inu-and-bonk-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Ju explained that store-of-value assets like gold and Bitcoin tend to rise in price when investors feel US economic dominance is under threat. However, he noted that confidence in the US economy and the dollar remains strong, with many investors continuing to view the dollar as a safe haven currency. This perception of strength, Ju argued, makes it unlikely that the Trump administration would adopt a Bitcoin strategic reserve. Instead, Trump may prioritize policies that reinforce the dominance of the US dollar. Ju stated: “Even before his inauguration, Trump consistently warned other world leaders of the power gap between the US and other nations. This rhetoric, combined with increased capital inflows to the dollar, could renew confidence in its supremacy.” He added, “Around me, many Koreans are choosing US dollars as a safe haven over gold or Bitcoin, particularly as the Korean won weakens.” This trend is mirrored in emerging economies, where individuals increasingly use US dollar stablecoins to store value. Stablecoins Boost US Dollar Dominance Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla recently told Cointelegraph at the Bitcoin MENA conference that stablecoins will be central to the blockchain economy. According to him, dollar-pegged stablecoins enhance the utility of the dollar by combining fiat currency stability with the speed and global reach of blockchain technology. In countries like Turkey, where inflation hit 67% in March 2024, stablecoins have become vital. Turkey leads the world in stablecoin purchases as a percentage of GDP. Similarly, a 2023 Chainalysis report revealed that over 50% of digital assets sent to countries like Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico were stablecoins.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trumps-bitcoin-policies-may-hinge-on-us-dollar-strength-says-cryptoquant-ceo/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
38250040,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631417,1735441200,Affordable Cryptocurrencies with High Growth Potential Turn Small Investments into Fortunes,"While Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to dominate the market, their high prices often leave new investors searching for more accessible opportunities with higher upside potential. For those seeking exponential gains, emerging cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals and innovative solutions present a compelling option. One such opportunity is the Lightchain AI Presale , a promising new project offering affordable entry and significant growth potential. These low-cost tokens allow investors to build substantial positions and increase the chances of turning small investments into major returns if the projects succeed. Below, we highlight a few affordable cryptocurrencies that stand out for their growth potential and long-term value. Lightchain AI (LCAI) Integrating AI for Limitless Utility What Sets It Apart Lightchain AI (LCAI) revolutionizes how we view blockchain by adding a much-needed layer of real-world utility artificial intelligence (AI) integration. At a presale price of around $0.003, LCAI offers an ultra-low entry point and the chance for extraordinary returns. Key Features Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) Developers can build AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps), opening doors to predictive analytics in finance, automated supply chain management, and intelligent healthcare solutions. Proof of Intelligence (PoI) Instead of just validating transactions, LCAI’s nodes perform valuable AI computations, ensuring the network constantly generates tangible value.

Growth Potential If LCAI executes its roadmap and AI adoption continues to accelerate globally, early-stage investors could see their small initial investments multiply dramatically. Manta Network (MANTA) Privacy Solutions at Accessible Prices In the DeFi world, keeping info safe is getting more and more important. Manta Network is special because it gives tools that focus on safety for trading, lending and other money tasks, letting users guard their ͏data and plans. With its price now under a dollar MANTA is good choice for people who think safe options will have a big role in DeFi’s future. MANTA is ready for growth because of many reasons. Privacy is coming up as an important thing, mostly since more big players are joining the crypto and DeFi fields, which will likely raise the need for privacy solutions. Also MANTA’s low cost makes it easy for new investors to get in, letting them create large holdings without needing to put in much money at first. Casper (CSPR) Enterprise-Ready on a Budget Casper (CSPR) stands out by targeting enterprises looking for professional-grade blockchain solutions. It is specifically designed for scalability, upgradeability, and energy efficiency, making it an attractive option for businesses incorporating blockchain into their operations. While it may not have the flashiness of AI integration or advanced privacy features, its focus on enterprise adoption offers significant long-term growth potential. As more companies adopt Casper’s technology, the demand for CSPR tokens could steadily increase, making early investments at lower prices potentially very rewarding. How Lightchain AI (LCAI) Beats All And Could Multiply Your Investment Many Times Lightchain AI (LCAI) is an emerging cryptocurrency that integrates artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, offering innovative solutions like the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM).

LCAI’s focus on decentralized AI solutions addresses real-world challenges across various industries, including healthcare, finance, and supply chain management. This broad applicability enhances its growth potential and appeal to a diverse investor base. Investors should conduct thorough research and consider the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency investments before participating.

38249304,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53348,1735438548,"Best Cryptos to Join Now: Qubetics Amasses 12,200 Holders While Solana and Ethereum Maintain Market Dominance","When it comes to crypto investments, you need more than just hype. The crypto world is full of projects offering varying degrees of opportunity, but some have truly stood out for their long-term potential, solid community backing, and strong market presence. Solana and Ethereum have proven themselves as heavyweights in the blockchain space, and today, we’re going to explore why they’re still among the best cryptos to join now. But there’s a new contender on the block making waves – Qubetics (TICS) , which has already raised millions during its presale and is gearing up for a major launch. In this article, we’re going to dive into the strengths and market impact of Qubetics, Solana, and Ethereum, and why all of them represent exciting opportunities for crypto investors. Let’s start with Qubetics. This innovative platform is making a name for itself with a focus on blockchain development tools, including the game-changing QubeQode IDE. It’s still in its presale phase, but it’s already proven that its potential is massive. With over $8 million raised and more than 12,200 token holders, the $TICS token is poised for major gains as it approaches its final presale stages. Investors are already buzzing about its 630%+ potential ROI at presale’s end and a projected 14,500% ROI post-launch. Let’s take a closer look at Qubetics and why it’s one of the best cryptos to join now. Qubetics: The Future of Blockchain Development and Investment Qubetics is taking the blockchain world by storm, offering investors a unique opportunity to get in early on what many believe is a game-changing platform. Right now, the Qubetics presale is in its 13th stage, and it’s already raked in over $8 million, selling more than 382 million $TICS tokens to over 12,200 holders. The presale’s success is evident, with the token currently priced at $0.037, but it won’t stay there for long. The price is set to surge by 10% when the presale hits its next stage. For anyone looking for the best cryptos to join now , Qubetics represents a golden opportunity to secure massive returns before the price skyrockets. Analysts are buzzing about Qubetics’ potential for insane ROI. Some predict $TICS could hit $0.25 by the end of the presale, offering investors an eye-watering 630% return. Post-presale, experts are suggesting even bigger price leaps, with the $TICS token potentially hitting $1 (2820% ROI) or even $5 (14,503% ROI). And that’s not all. If $TICS continues its upward momentum after the mainnet launch, it could reach $15, offering a jaw-dropping 43,711% return on investment. But Qubetics isn’t just about incredible ROI. The platform’s cutting-edge technology is designed to address some of the major pain points in blockchain development, and this is where Qubetics truly shines. The QubeQode Development Interface is set to revolutionize the way developers, businesses, and professionals create smart contracts and dApps. Imagine being able to build complex blockchain applications without needing to be a coding expert. With QubeQode, that’s now possible. For businesses, QubeQode streamlines the entire blockchain development process . Whether you’re a startup or a well-established company, creating and deploying blockchain solutions can be costly and time-consuming. QubeQode makes it easier and more affordable than ever before to build decentralized applications, tokenise assets, and interact with the blockchain. For example, an e-commerce business could use QubeQode to integrate cryptocurrency payments without needing a full-time blockchain developer. With its intuitive interface and powerful features, QubeQode makes blockchain accessible to a whole new audience. Qubetics’ focus on accessibility, security, and scalability means it’s perfectly poised to capture the growing demand for Web3 technologies. Whether you’re an individual developer or part of a larger enterprise, Qubetics offers the tools you need to bring your blockchain vision to life. And with the $TICS token holding so much potential, now is the time to invest before the price inevitably rises. Solana: A High-Speed Blockchain with a Track Record of Success Solana has proven itself as one of the most reliable and efficient blockchain platforms in the crypto space. Known for its high-speed transactions and scalability, Solana has positioned itself as a top choice for developers and investors alike. Over the years, Solana has made a name for itself as one of the best cryptos to join now, thanks to its strong performance and growing adoption. What makes Solana stand out is its ability to handle thousands of transactions per second without compromising on security or decentralisation. With its innovative Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus mechanism, Solana has become one of the fastest blockchains on the market, processing over 65,000 transactions per second at its peak. This level of scalability is what has attracted both developers and institutional investors, who are keen on using Solana’s infrastructure to build decentralised applications (dApps) and facilitate high-frequency transactions. Solana’s impressive performance over the years has made it a strong alternative to Ethereum, which is known for its slower transaction speeds and higher fees. Solana has been able to attract major projects, including DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and even large financial institutions. With its low transaction fees and speed, Solana has become a favourite among those looking for a blockchain that can handle high throughput without breaking the bank. For investors, Solana represents a unique opportunity. Its market position as a leading blockchain for decentralized finance (DeFi) and other dApp-based services has made it one of the most sought-after projects in the space. Analysts are optimistic about Solana’s future, with predictions suggesting that the token could see significant growth in the coming years. With its current price hovering around $218, many are confident that Solana will continue to play a central role in the blockchain ecosystem, making it one of the best cryptos to join now for long-term growth. Ethereum: The King of Smart Contracts and Decentralised Applications Ethereum remains one of the most well-known and established blockchain platforms in the world. It has cemented its position as the go-to platform for decentralised applications (dApps) and smart contracts, with thousands of developers building on its network. Ethereum has been a key driver of blockchain adoption, and it continues to be one of the best cryptos to join now due to its ongoing developments and major upgrades. Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with Ethereum 2.0 was a pivotal moment in its history. The upgrade aims to make the network more scalable, secure, and energy-efficient, addressing some of the issues that have plagued Ethereum in the past. With the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, the network is now able to process more transactions per second while reducing its environmental impact. This has made Ethereum even more attractive to developers and investors who are looking for a blockchain that can support large-scale applications while also being more sustainable. Over the years, Ethereum has become synonymous with smart contracts and DeFi. It has served as the foundation for countless dApps, from NFT platforms to decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Ethereum has also become the leading platform for issuing new tokens, with the ERC-20 standard allowing developers to create their digital assets with ease. This has led to a massive influx of projects built on Ethereum, contributing to its strong market position. For investors, Ethereum represents a solid bet in the world of blockchain technology. With the ongoing developments in the Ethereum ecosystem, many analysts predict that Ethereum’s price could continue to rise, making it a strong contender for anyone looking for the best cryptos to join now. Conclusion: The Best Cryptos to Join Now Whether you’re looking for a high-potential presale like Qubetics, a fast, scalable blockchain like Solana, or a tried-and-tested smart contract platform like Ethereum, these three projects represent the best cryptos to join now for anyone looking to get into the crypto space. With their strong market positions, innovative technologies, and massive growth potential, these projects are set to play a key role in shaping the future of cryptocurrency. The Qubetics presale offers an incredible opportunity to get in early before it becomes a major player in the blockchain world. Solana and Ethereum have already proven themselves as solid investments, and they continue to show strong growth potential for the future. Are you ready to take the plunge and be part of the next big thing in crypto? The best time to invest is now, and with projects like Qubetics, Solana, and Ethereum leading the charge, the future of blockchain looks brighter than ever.

38248764,https://nulltx.com/?p=137118,1735438531,"Best Cryptos to Invest in This Weekend: Qubetics’ 630% ROI, Ethereum DeFi Power, Kaspa Scalability","Best Cryptos to Invest in This Weekend: Qubetics’ 630% ROI Potential, Ethereum`s DeFi Dominance and Kaspa`s Scalability Edge With cryptocurrency continuing to make waves, it’s crucial to stay ahead of the curve and know the best cryptos to invest in this weekend. While Bitcoin and Ethereum have long been the go-to choices for crypto enthusiasts, there’s a new player in town making some serious noise: Qubetics. As more investors search for alternative investment options to traditional assets, these digital assets are gaining traction. But what makes these coins different from each other? And why should you consider them now? Qubetics (TICS), Ethereum (ETH), and Kaspa (KAS) represent distinct aspects of the crypto ecosystem. Ethereum, the long-time giant of the smart contract world, has continued to thrive by fulfilling the demand for decentralised applications (dApps) and DeFi protocols. Kaspa, on the other hand, is quickly making a name for itself with its ultra-fast transaction speeds and scalability, appealing to investors looking for cutting-edge technology. And then there’s Qubetics, currently in its 13th presale stage, offering exciting potential and opportunities for early-stage investors who want to get in on the ground floor. Let’s break it down. Qubetics: The Fresh Gem with Unbeatable ROI Potential When looking for the best cryptos to invest in this weekend, Qubetics (TICS) should be on your radar. With its innovative AI-driven blockchain tools, Qubetics is poised to revolutionise how we think about blockchain development. The Qubetics presale is currently in its 13th stage, having raised over $8 million by selling more than 382 million $TICS tokens to over 12,200 holders. The $TICS token is priced at just $0.0342 in the 13th stage, but hold on – this price is set to surge by 10% come the weekend. The growth of Qubetics is undeniable, and the potential returns are jaw-dropping. Analysts predict that $TICS will be valued at $0.25 by the end of the presale, offering investors a staggering 630% return on investment (ROI). But it doesn’t stop there – once the presale wraps up and the project moves into its mainnet launch phase, the price of $TICS could skyrocket to as high as $5, offering an ROI of 14,503%. That’s enough to make even the most seasoned investors sit up and pay attention. Now, let’s talk about QubeQode Development Interface. This AI-powered IDE is a game-changer for blockchain development. Imagine being able to easily create and deploy smart contracts without having to be a coding expert. QubeQode simplifies the entire process, making blockchain accessible for businesses, professionals, and individuals alike. Whether you’re a developer looking for an intuitive platform to launch your next project or a business owner seeking to implement blockchain into your operations, QubeQode offers the perfect toolkit. For example, a small business wanting to incorporate blockchain into its supply chain can use QubeQode to develop smart contracts for automated payments and tracking. Or think about how developers building decentralized applications can drastically cut down development time with QubeQode’s easy-to-use interface. The possibilities are endless, and the demand for solutions like this is growing as businesses move towards adopting Web3 technologies. So, if you’re eyeing the best cryptos to invest in this weekend, Qubetics is a clear frontrunner with its revolutionary tools and impressive presale performance. Ethereum: The King of Smart Contracts Ethereum (ETH) has long held its position as one of the best cryptos to invest in this weekend, and for good reason. As the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum continues to be the backbone of decentralised applications (dApps) and the decentralised finance (DeFi) sector. Over the years, Ethereum has demonstrated its dominance in the market by consistently pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology and offering new, innovative solutions for investors and developers alike. The Ethereum network is most famous for its smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements that run on the blockchain without the need for intermediaries. This feature has made Ethereum the go-to platform for launching dApps, powering DeFi projects, and enabling the creation of NFTs. As of late 2024, Ethereum is also progressing with its shift to Ethereum 2.0, which promises to improve scalability, reduce energy consumption, and enhance network security. This upgrade could further cement Ethereum’s position as a dominant force in the crypto space. Ethereum’s position as a store of value and an investment vehicle has also been reinforced by its growing presence in institutional and retail markets. Investors have flocked to Ethereum not only for its technological advancements but also as a hedge against inflation and traditional market volatility. Ethereum’s flexibility, transparency, and security make it a reliable asset for diversifying an investment portfolio. If you’re looking for a strong and proven cryptocurrency that’s shown resilience over time, Ethereum continues to be one of the best cryptos to invest in this weekend. Kaspa: Speed, Scalability, and the Future of Blockchain If you’re searching for something fresh and innovative, Kaspa (KAS) is a name you need to know. Kaspa offers an entirely different take on blockchain technology, focusing on speed and scalability, which are two major challenges that traditional blockchains, including Ethereum, often struggle with. By using the DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) structure, Kaspa enables near-instant transaction finality and the ability to process tens of thousands of transactions per second. This makes Kaspa a highly attractive option for investors seeking fast, low-cost transactions in a decentralised network. The Kaspa network is gaining traction, especially as blockchain adoption increases, and it offers several advantages over legacy blockchain systems. Its ability to handle high throughput with minimal delays is particularly appealing for use cases in industries like financial services, gaming, and decentralized exchanges (DEXs), where speed is crucial. Additionally, the Kaspa team is committed to continuous development, with frequent network upgrades that enhance the overall user experience and scalability. While Kaspa’s market position is still emerging compared to Ethereum’s, the growth potential is massive. With its unique features and focus on solving the scalability issues that have plagued other blockchains, Kaspa is becoming an increasingly popular choice for those looking to diversify their cryptocurrency investments. For anyone who believes that speed and scalability will be the driving forces of the next generation of blockchain technologies, Kaspa is one of the best cryptos to invest in this weekend. Conclusion: The Future is Now – Take Action As the crypto market evolves, investors are presented with exciting opportunities, whether you’re looking for the stability of Ethereum, the speed of Kaspa, or the groundbreaking potential of Qubetics. These projects represent the future of finance and blockchain technology, each with its unique strengths and opportunities. If you’re looking for the best cryptos to invest in this weekend, Qubetics stands out with its strong presale performance and promising returns. The Qubetics presale has been a game-changer, with over $7 million raised and more than 355 million $TICS tokens sold to over 10,600 holders. Ethereum remains a rock-solid option for those seeking a proven store of value in the crypto space, while Kaspa offers a cutting-edge alternative for those who want speed and scalability in their investments. All three projects are pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in blockchain technology, and each of them has the potential to deliver impressive returns in the years to come. So, what are you waiting for? Don’t miss out on these incredible opportunities. Whether you choose to invest in Qubetics, Ethereum, or Kaspa, the time to act is now. The future of crypto is unfolding, and the best cryptos to invest in this weekend are right at your fingertips. Jump in and secure your place in the next generation of digital assets today.

Cardano (ADA) & Tron (TRX) Price Predictions Stay Positive,"As 2025 approaches, the crypto industry is growing, with notable projects advancing steadily. This week, the Cardano (ADA) price climbed to $0.937 despite less network activity, suggesting a guarded hope for its future performance. Simultaneously, the forecast for Tron remains positive, with TRX priced at $0.2573 and experts expecting a rise to $2 by 2030. On the other hand, in current presales, BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out as one of the best cryptos to buy now. Its BDAG400 bonus initially gives a 250% reward on the first purchase and offers more bonuses for subsequent buys. With a price projection of $1 by 2025, BlockDAG presents a unique chance for early participants to earn significant rewards. Cardano (ADA) Price Increases Despite Reduced Network Use This week saw the Cardano (ADA) price rebound sharply to $0.937, recovering impressively from recent lows. However, current statistics indicate possible hurdles ahead for the network. The transaction fees have fallen to a three-year low at 0.25 ADA on Wednesday, a drop from a peak of 0.615 ADA earlier in the year. This fee reduction, typically associated with lower network use, aligns with a notable decrease in daily active and new addresses, each down by over 35%. While the recovery in Cardano (ADA) price is encouraging, these indicators suggest a cautious outlook as overall network trends continue to evolve. Tron Price Prediction: Optimism for $0.5 by 2027 The outlook for Tron in the near term remains bullish, with TRX recently valued at $0.2573. Analysts predict continued growth, estimating a rise to $0.332 soon and targeting between $0.6718 and $0.8074 by 2027. By 2030, TRX is expected to exceed $2, indicating strong long-term growth prospects. Recent analyses show positive signals, such as a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 53.89, which points to solid market trust. Moreover, Tron’s recent partnership with Chainlink’s SCALE program, as revealed by founder Justin Sun last November, highlights its increasing practicality. These elements together strengthen the positive forecast for Tron’s price. BDAG Buyers Reap Big with BlockDAG’s Exclusive BDAG400 Bonus! BlockDAG introduces the BDAG400 bonus, presenting a great chance for early buyers to become part of this year’s biggest presale crypto . By applying the BDAG400 code during checkout, buyers gain a 250% bonus on their first purchase, effectively converting a purchase of 1,000 BDAG coins into 3,500 coins! The continuous purchases trigger even larger bonuses: a 270% bonus on the second buy, while the third, fourth, and fifth purchases contain bonus surprises in “mystery boxes.” This setup motivates continuous engagement, with each additional purchase unveiling further rewards. This bonus system includes a total of five rewards—two revealed initially and three as surprises—delivering substantial rewards for ongoing participants. However, this is a time-sensitive offer to acquire more of this exciting layer 1 coin through these bonuses. BlockDAG’s presale has witnessed remarkable success, with the coin’s value skyrocketing by 2240% from its starting price of $0.001. Those who joined early have reaped considerable rewards, solidifying BlockDAG’s position as one of the best cryptos to buy now. Market analysts project that BDAG might reach $1 by 2025, marking a significant opportunity for those looking to capitalize on its upward trajectory. Since its presale began, BlockDAG has raised over $173 million and sold 17.5 billion coins. Priced currently at $0.0234, the ongoing presale offers perfect timing for those looking for the best crypto to buy now. Yet, as the presale nears its $600 million goal, the window for early participation is closing rapidly. Wrapping Up These three coins showcase the diverse opportunities available in the crypto market. The Cardano (ADA) price remains robust with its recent increase, though a decline in network activity raises some concerns about its future. Tron is also making strides, with Tron price prediction indicating considerable growth to $2 by 2030, supported by its growing utility and positive market sentiment. Yet, for those considering the best crypto to buy now, BlockDAG stands out as a top pick. Its record-breaking presale success and promising future prospects position it as a prime candidate for significant returns. With a price prediction of $1 by 2025, the BDAG400 bonus system provides a unique opportunity for purchasers to substantially increase their BDAG holdings. For those aiming for remarkable returns, now is the time to engage, as this chance is fleeting.

38248507,https://thecoinrise.com/early-web3bay-investors-could-see-6430-roi-stealing-the-spotlight-from-hedera-cardano/,1735437635,Early Web3Bay Investors Could See 6430% ROI—Stealing the Spotlight from Hedera & Cardano!,"As the 2024 bull market takes off, investors are turning their attention to projects like Hedera Hashgraph, Cardano, and Web3Bay that demonstrate real innovation and potential for substantial growth. Hedera Hashgraph is attracting institutional interest with its groundbreaking ETF filing, enhancing market liquidity. Meanwhile, Cardano has witnessed a remarkable 76% increase in value within a week, thanks to strategic alliances and significant activity from major investors. Yet, Web3Bay is reshaping the e-commerce sector by offering a fully decentralized platform that cuts out expensive middlemen. Its initial token offering starts at just $0.003 each, with projections showing a potential return of 6430%, highlighting it as a particularly promising investment. Web3Bay successfully combines blockchain’s capabilities with practical applications, making it the preferred option for progressive investors. Significant Advancements in Hedera Hashgraph Recently, Hedera Hashgraph has seen considerable developments, especially with Canary Capital filing for the first-ever HBAR ETF. This initiative is set to facilitate regulated access to Hedera’s tokens, potentially attracting more institutional investors and enhancing liquidity in the market. Following this development, the price of HBAR increased by nearly 20%, a reflection of the positive response from investors. Additionally, the inclusion of HBAR in Robinhood Markets’ crypto offerings has made it more accessible to traders in the U.S., further boosting its market presence. Cardano Experiences Strong Growth Cardano has shown impressive growth, with a 76% price increase noted last week. This surge is largely driven by significant buying from large-scale investors and is supported by the platform’s strategic partnerships and government projects. Although current technical indicators suggest Cardano might be overbought, potentially leading to short-term price adjustments, the continuous development and strategic efforts maintain its momentum and reinforce its position as a leading blockchain platform. Why Web3Bay’s Early Adopters Are Set for Phenomenal Growth Web3Bay is at the forefront of the e-commerce decentralization movement. Unlike traditional platforms that depend on banks and other financial intermediaries, Web3Bay eliminates these actors entirely. This blockchain-based marketplace allows users to conduct transactions directly, which significantly lowers costs and enhances both security and transparency. Moreover, Web3Bay’s 3BAY token is designed to support scalable network growth. It seamlessly integrates with major Layer-1 blockchains, ensuring that transaction processing remains fast and secure even as user activity increases. For those looking to invest early, Web3Bay’s presale offers an enticing entry point. The tokens are initially priced at just $0.003, with the price set to increase by 15% in each of the 28 stages, culminating at $0.1959 per token. This structured approach not only provides early backers with a potential ROI of 6430% but also positions them at the forefront of what could be a game-changing shift in e-commerce. Wrapping Up While Hedera and Cardano showcase the potential of blockchain for broader institutional acceptance and network expansion, Web3Bay is leading the way with actionable innovations. It transforms e-commerce by providing greater user control, transparency, and reduced fees. Its presale offers investors unmatched return prospects, highlighting its financial and technological promise.Investors looking to meld practical utility with significant returns will find Web3Bay to be the standout in a crowded market.

38248325,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=667859,1735437629,Price Waves Reveal Pivotal AVAX Support At $31 – Details,"In line with the general crypto market, Avalanche (AVAX) has experienced significant market correction over the past two weeks following an extended price rally. With the altcoin’s price now hovering around the $36 price zone, recent market predictions have highlighted a critical market condition needed to avoid a complete collapse of AVAX’s bullish structure. Related Reading: AVAX Price Inches Closer To $50 – Will Bulls Deliver A Breakout? AVAX Bulls Must Defend $35.30 For Total Price Recovery On December 27, digital asset analysis platform More Crypto Online shared an insightful commentary on the AVAX market via the X platform. With the aid of the Elliott Wave Theory, the market experts forecasted a yellow scenario which is typically a bullish projection. For context, the yellow scenario indicates an asset is in a corrective phase specifically within the B-wave of an A-B-C correction i.e a three-wave pattern that occurs during a price correction of which B is usually an upward movement that aligns with the ongoing market trend before transitioning to a final downward C-wave. A yellow scenario suggests the B-wave is still forming and could push higher, provided an asset’s price holds above certain levels. In terms of the AVAX market, analysts at More Crypto Online state the asset price must remain above $31.69 to keep the yellow scenario valid. However, to strengthen the case of this yellow scenario, market bulls must ensure AVAX’s price does not break below $35.3 as a dissent below this price region could potentiate a further decline to $31.69. The analyst warns that any price fall below this lower threshold would invalidate the yellow scenario resulting in a downward C-wave. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) 25% Surge Fueled By New Initiatives To Support Developers AVAX Price Overview At the time of writing, AVAX trades at $36.74 following a decline of 2.12% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the altcoin’s daily trading volume is down by 6.40% and valued at $448.45 million. On larger time charts, AVAX is in greater losses of 11.65% in 7 days and 14.81% in 30 days, demonstrating a consistent decline in recent weeks. In making any headway, AVAX will first need to confront a major resistance at the $42 price zone, the subversion of which could open the pathway for a potential rally to $55. With the crypto bull run predicted to fully take off in early 2025, this altcoin remains an investor’s favorite following its price performance in the 2021 bull cycle during which it gained by over 4,400 to establish its current all-time high of $144.96. With a market cap of $14.92, AVAX continues to rank as the 11th largest asset in the cryptocurrency market.

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/homosexual-pepe-homopepe-solana-memecoin-will-explode-18000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

While the Dogecoin price is exhibiting impressive growth prospects in this bull run, the meme coin faces limited upside, leaving Dogecoin whales to pursue massive returns on their investment elsewhere. Read on to see why ETFSwap (ETFS) is the perfect pick for Dogecoin-like gains towards 2025. Dogecoin Whales Are Targeting New Coins With Potential For Huge Profits Dogecoin whales are recognized as major market movers after hitting huge profits from early DOGE investments. Moreover, the Dogecoin price has impressed over the past few weeks, delivering decent gains to investors who caught the bullish trend early. However, experts believe the Dogecoin price provides limited upside due to its $50 billion market cap. As of this writing, the Dogecoin price is at $0.3343, having gained over 250% in the past year. Most Dogecoin holders at this stage of the market cycle are targeting a return to its $0.73 all-time high and potentially a surge to $1. Although Dogecoin whales have the size to make the most of this potential price surge, it makes sense to pursue other opportunities promising huge returns with a small investment. ETFSwap (ETFS) is in the price range that will make early investors millionaires at the peak of the bull run. Thus, the new DeFi token might set up early investors as the next generation of Dogecoin whales.

This new cheap DeFi token is attracting institutional and retail investors alike who see the prospects of its unique solution. At the same time, recent market trends show growing traction from Dogecoin whales as ETFSwap (ETFS) sees some heavy purchases. ETFSwap (ETFS) had a massive presale a few months back, and the Uniswap launch has featured major traction from investors capitalizing on its prospect for short and long-term gains. ETFSwap (ETFS) is a new platform that will deliver the ETF market on-chain , allowing investors to buy tokenized ETFs backed by actual securities from traditional markets. Also, the tokenized ETFs will feature assets from various industries , including healthcare, energy, engineering, and more. This gives users the option to easily diversify and convert between ETFs much easier than with centralized platforms. Additionally, ETFSwap (ETFS) will partner with regulated investment banks that trade both cryptocurrencies and securities. This enables cross-compatibility between ETFs and cryptocurrencies, creating a platform for easy crypto-to-ETF conversion. Furthermore, the new ETFSwap (ETFS) platform promises unique features , including faster ETF settlements, lower transaction costs, staking for passive rewards, and many more. Staking the native ETFS token will deliver up to 87% APR, and this cheap DeFi token is still incredibly cheap on Uniswap. As you consider adding the DeFi token to your portfolio, it’s pertinent to note that it’s listed on CoinMarketCap , and the ETFSwap (ETFS) team has passed a KYC audit by SolidProof . Conclusion Dogecoin whales are diversifying their DOGE holdings into ETFSwap (ETFS) to target huge market returns in the coming months. The new ETF platform is poised as the obvious option for investors looking to diversify into the ETF market. At the same time, its unique on-chain features will entice TradFi users to pursue more profits on the token.

Ali Martinez tells his 104,600 followers on the social media platform X that the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential Indicator presented a bullish signal for DOGE. “The TD Sequential presents a buy signal on the Dogecoin DOGE four-hour chart, anticipating a price rebound!” Source: Ali Martinez/X Traders use the TD Sequential Indicator to predict potential trend reversals for tokens based on the closing prices of their 13 previous bars or candles. Martinez also notes that Dogecoin whales bought more than 90 million DOGE in the past two days. Source: Ali Martinez/X DOGE is trading at $0.314 at time of writing, a fractional decrease in the past 24 hours. Looking at Bitcoin ( BTC ), Martinez warns that traders should be worried if the top-ranked crypto asset by market cap drops below a certain price level. “You don’t want BTC to dip below $92,730 – it’s essentially free-fall territory if that level breaks.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Martinez suggests that below $92,730, the next on-chain support for BTC hovers at around $69,000 based on Glassnode’s UTXO ( Unspent Transaction Output ) Realized Price Distribution, a metric that shows the amount of Bitcoin that last moved within a specific price bucket. But while Martinez is sounding the alarm about a potential pullback for BTC, he notes that a 20-30% correction represents “the most bullish thing that could happen to Bitcoin.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Bitcoin is trading at $94,671 at time of writing.

On Dec. 29, El Salvador acquired an additional 1 BTC, bringing its total holdings to 6,000.77 Bitcoin, valued at $569.3 million, according to the National Bitcoin Office’s portfolio tracker. This latest purchase reflects a gain of 108.02% on its Bitcoin investment, with an average acquisition price of $45,450 per BTC, as per the Nayib Bukele portfolio tracker. The country made its first Bitcoin purchase of 200 BTC on Sept. 6, 2021, coinciding with its historic decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. El Salvador Among Top Bitcoin-Holding Nations With 6,000.77 BTC, El Salvador ranks sixth in Bitcoin holdings among nation-states, following the United States, China, the United Kingdom, Ukraine, and Bhutan, according to BitBo’s Bitcoin Treasuries data. Although El Salvador typically acquires one Bitcoin daily, it made significant purchases on Dec. 22 and one day after striking a $1.4 billion agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This occurred despite the IMF urging the country to scale back its Bitcoin activities. Stacy Herbert, Director of El Salvador’s National Bitcoin Office, suggested in a Dec. 19 post on X that the country might accelerate its Bitcoin acquisitions. A Bitcoin Office spokesperson confirmed to Cointelegraph that El Salvador has no plans to sell its holdings, emphasizing that “Bitcoin continues to be our main strategy.” Chivo Wallet to Be Phased Out However, Herbert noted that El Salvador’s Chivo wallet will “be sold or wound down,” with private-sector Bitcoin wallets expected to take over the role.

38245861,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=667880,1735432212,XRP Forms Bullish Flag Pattern: What’s Next For The Altcoin?,"XRP is capturing attention across the crypto market as it forms a bullish flag pattern, a classic technical setup often signaling potential upside. This development comes after a strong price surge, followed by a period of consolidation that mirrors the shape of a flag. Such patterns are typically interpreted as continuation signals, hinting that the recent upward momentum could resume if key conditions are met. Currently trading within this flag’s boundaries, XRP appears to be gathering strength for its next big move. A successful breakout would likely validate the bullish scenario, positioning the altcoin for significant gains and sparking renewed optimism in the market. Conversely, a breakdown below the lower boundary could undermine hopes, paving the way for a possible retracement. Analyzing The Bullish Flag: A Closer Look At XRP’s Pattern The bullish flag pattern is a reliable continuation signal in technical analysis, suggesting further upside potential. For XRP, this pattern has gained attention as it indicates the cryptocurrency may be preparing for its next upward move. Related Reading: XRP Price Takes a 5% Hit: Is More Downside Ahead? XRP’s price initially surges, creating a “flagpole” driven by strong positive momentum and high volume. Following this is a consolidation phase where the price moves within a narrow range, typically downward or sideways. This consolidation represents a temporary pause in the uptrend, allowing the market to digest gains. It demonstrates resilience, suggesting that selling pressure is manageable and the bullish trend could resume. Furthermore, the formation is validated when the price breaks out above the upper boundary of the flag, resuming its prior upward trajectory. Such a breakout would signal renewed buying interest and the potential to test higher price levels. Key indicators to watch include increased trading volume during the breakout as this confirms market participation and bullish conviction. Additionally, XRP must sustain its momentum above the resistance level to avoid the risk of a false breakout. Key Resistance And Support Levels: Navigating The Breakout Potential If XRP’s price breaks out above the upper boundary of the bullish flag pattern, it could signal the continuation of the uptrend and open the door for a move toward higher price levels, with the next major resistance zone near $2.90. A successful breakout above this level would reinforce the upside trend, possibly leading to new price highs. Related Reading: XRP Consolidation Could End Once It Clears $2.60 – Top Analyst Expects $4 Soon However, if XRP breaks below the lower boundary of the flag, the immediate support to watch is $1.90. A decisive break below this level could signal a shift in market sentiment, potentially leading to further downside movement. Such a breach would suggest that the bullish momentum has faltered, and the next support zone might be tested, which may trigger additional selling pressure.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-cyborg-trumpcyb-solana-memecoin-to-rally-over-15000-before-exchange-listing-as-bonk-and-dogecoin-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Grab This Best New Meme Coin Presale for a 50% Bonus for Huge ROI or Miss Out Again!,"Picture this: the year is early 2024, and meme coins are all the rage. You’ve just heard of a quirky new token, Turbo (TURBO), hitting Coinbase and skyrocketing in value. You think about investing but hold back.

Turbo (TURBO): The Meme Coin That Got Away Launched as a bold experiment in 2023, Turbo (TURBO) started as a community-driven meme coin with no initial funding. Its meteoric rise was turbocharged when Coinbase listed it, sending the price soaring to $0.00997 at its peak. Despite slight retracements, TURBO still stands as one of the most promising meme coins of recent times. Here’s a quick recap of TURBO’s journey: Initial Hype: The community rallied behind TURBO’s underdog story, pushing its market cap into the hundreds of millions within months. Key Milestones: TURBO got a major boost with its Coinbase listing, increasing liquidity and visibility. Market Performance: Currently priced at ~$0.0089, TURBO remains a high-volatility asset that demands careful timing. Missed TURBO’s early days? You’re not alone. Many hesitated, thinking it was just another meme coin. But those who trusted the process reaped huge rewards, proving that early adoption is key in crypto. While TURBO still holds potential, the question remains: is it worth chasing an asset that’s already made its big leap? Why 2024’s Economic Lessons Make BTFD a Must-Buy If history teaches us anything, it’s that crises breed opportunities. The 1973–74 crash saw markets drop nearly 50%, but savvy investors like Warren Buffett thrived by buying undervalued assets. The same principle applies to meme coins like BTFD. Today, market dips aren’t signs of doom—they’re launchpads. BTFD’s Stage 7 rollback price is the ultimate dip-buying opportunity . Add in the 90% staking APY and P2E game rewards, and you’re looking at a project with both short-term gains and long-term potential. Conclusion: Don’t Let This Best New Meme Coin Presale Slip Away You might’ve missed Turbo’s early rally, but BTFD Coin is here to offer you a second chance at riding the meme coin wave. With its innovative features, strong community, and a presale discount that screams value, BTFD is poised to make headlines in 2025.
