42397196,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAakXR9,1374614915,SEC charges Texas man for defrauding investors in bitcoin Ponzi scheme,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged a Texas man and his company for defrauding investors using a bitcoin Ponzi scheme.  According to the SEC, Trendon T. Shavers, founder and operator of Bitcoin Savings and Trust (BTCST), allegedly used the monikers 'Pirate' and 'pirateat40' to offer and sell bitcoin investments on the internet. He managed to raise at least 700,000 BTC, which is now worth more than $64 million.  Shavers promised the investors they would receive up to 7% interest per week based on the company's bitcoin market arbitrage activity, however, BTCST was merely a pyramid scheme that used money from new investors to pay the 'interest payments' of earlier investors. The SEC alleges Shavers was also exchanging investors' bitcoins for US dollars in order to pay his personal expenses.  An investor alert issued by the SEC warned people about the dangers of investment scams using digital currencies such as bitcoin.  “Fraudsters are not beyond the reach of the SEC just because they use bitcoin or another virtual currency to mislead investors and violate the federal securities laws,” said Andrew Calamari, director of the SEC’s New York Regional Office.  He went on to explain that Shavers had claimed, in an online forum, that his investments carried no risk, but huge profits. In reality, his intentions were ""rooted in nothing more than personal greed"".  The SEC is charging Shavers and BTCST with violating anti-fraud and registration provisions of security laws. It is seeking a court order to freeze the assets of Shavers and his company, plus is also looking for permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and financial penalties.  The investor alert warns that if an investment appears too good to be true, it often is.  “Ponzi scheme operators often claim to have a tie to a new and emerging technology as a lure to potential victims,” said Lori Schock, director of the SEC’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy. “Investors should understand that regardless of the type of investment, a promise of high returns with little or no risk is a classic warning sign of fraud.”  Patrick Murck of the Bitcoin Foundation said Shavers preyed on the bitcoin community so it's no surprise the SEC decided to take action against him.  ""This is a clear warning to scammers and schemers that bitcoin does not suddenly make Ponzi schemes or other scams moral or legal.  ""I think the SEC was very responsible in noting that this is not a bitcoin story, rather an all too common story of a scammer promising investors a too good to be true opportunity,"" he added.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2013/07/23/sec-charges-texas-man-for-defrauding-investors-in-bitcoin-ponzi-scheme,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c08bbf79a763088613dd609c4cdff9131dc67035-1000x662.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397207,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAakXby,1374585339,BitFantasy is an MMORPG in which players can trade virtual items for bitcoin,"BitFantasy is a new online role playing game whose unique selling point is that players can trade with each other using bitcoin. The game is in its early beta phase, but its developer, Darren Tarbard, says he is ensuring that this won't be a pay to win kind of game.  Darren Tarbard has been developing software for around 20 years, half of which has been for financial organisations. However, his hobby has always been game development. The idea of BitFantasy received a lot of positive feedback when Darren suggested it on Reddit. From that point, he decided to stop his software contract work and took on the challenge of a bitcoin-driven MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role playing game) as his full-time occupation.  As for the plot of the game – it's not that complicated. You live in an infinite world, and you explore it by building roads to discover new villages, resources or mysteries. In terms of antagonists, there is a ""world-eating"" monster destroying land, and the royal guard has started a revolt against the Queen. She, of course, recruits you to rebuild the world and fight the royal guard.  In case you're wondering how you'll be able to play BitFantasy, Darren told us: ""We expect BitFantasy to be playable by anyone with a modern web browser. This brings significant challenges based on the differences between browsers, particularly mobile, but we think it's worth it to make it easy for everyone to access"".  Darren said that he is taking things slowly to get an idea of server load and to look for unforeseen bugs. Instead of going through the now popular social crowdfunding route (e.g. Kickstarter), BitFantasy has a 0.01 BTC sign up price. Darren told us, ""…the minimum is 0.01 BTC, but if you pay more you get some (non-game breaking) perks.""  So far, the BitFantasy team is made up of Darren and a level designer. However, he hopes that increased funding will allow the team to be expanded.  As for the inclusion of Bitcoin, it was a pragmatic choice. Part of the game's specification was to allow for player-to-player trades with real-world money. Darren looked at PayPal but found it far too complicated to implement. ""I don't think it would be possible to implement the direct player-to-player trading in any other way. For us to do the same thing with (for example) PayPal would require every player to have a PayPal merchant account, and for me to have their API keys and other shenanigans that I don't even want to think about.""  The risk for any online game including real-world money is that a ""pay to win"" climate is produced. However, BitFantasy is avoiding this by restricting the ways in which real-world currency (including BTC) is used. Darren stated: ""So you can't buy gold pieces. You can't even buy items with BTC unless you buy it from another real human player; computer-controlled shopkeepers only trade in gold pieces.""  When asked on about the good and bad points of developing a game with bitcoin support, Darren said: ""The biggest disadvantage is really that it is still a niche, but then again, it gives my game something that the other thousand online games don't have. I get strange looks when I tell people what I'm working on because for many people it seems obscure. I became an indie developer to work on what I enjoyed and what I believed in, so that keeps me going despite any other doubts. The advantage is one of flexibility as I mentioned. I haven't found any technical issues. ""  If you want to apply to test BitFantasy, head over to https://www.bitfantasy.com/.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/23/bitfantasy-is-an-mmorpg-in-which-players-can-trade-virtual-items-for-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/61428ed7440e5bb4df46bbaf2047db70c9e92c91-1024x615.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397193,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAakXPB,1374581109,Litecoin founder Charles Lee on the origins and potential of the world's second largest cryptocurrency,"Charles Lee isn’t nearly as invisible as Satoshi Nakamoto, but he’s doing his best. The creator of Litecoin, the second most successful cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, was happy to speak with CoinDesk, but he didn’t want to reveal too much about himself. What we know for sure about the California-based software engineer is that he graduated from a leading technology-focused university in 1999, and is currently working for an Internet software company. CoinDesk knows who that is – and the odd reference can be found online by those who know where to look - but Lee really doesn’t like to talk about it.  The six-person team behind the altcoin is equally secretive. “They are people that I talked to over the years on IRC and other forums,” Lee says of the team, which communicates with the broader community through chat rooms and message boards. “Some of them don't want their identities known.”  “People are always afraid of government intervention,” he says. “Cryptocurrency is such a powerful concept that it can almost overturn governments.”  Lee heard about Bitcoin two years ago, and almost immediately understood the significance of the idea. “I definitely think that what the Internet did to information, cryptocurrency will do to currency,” he says. Like many digital coin enthusiasts, he started mining bitcoin before getting into the altcoin scene.  First flirtations with altcoins  Around that time, an altcoin called IXcoin was launched. Still more appeared, and Lee decided to get in on the act, creating Fairbrix in September 2011.  Fairbrix was a clone of Tenebrix, an altcurrency created in 2011, but its launch was mismanaged. “The developer of the coin mined the coin, created seven million coins for himself and then launched it,” says Lee, arguing that a lot of people were wary of supporting it. “So there was community interest in creating a clone coin to make it more fair by having zero pre-mined.”  Fairbrix was Lee’s first flirtation with Scrypt as a proof of work function. Unlike Bitcoin’s SHA-256 function, Scrypt is designed to be CPU-friendly, making it more difficult for ASIC miners to control the network, and letting people who can’t afford expensive specialist hardware in on the act. Unfortunately, Fairbrix was a failure.  Part of the problem was a software bug. The client that Fairbrix used, called Multicoin, supported multiple coins. The bug stopped many of the initial Fairbrix blocks from producing coins. “Because of that, and also because it was 51% attacked from the start, the coin didn't have a fair launch and it failed from there,” Lee recalls. These attacks are relatively easy to launch early on in a coin’s life, because there are often not enough miners to protect the network against control.  His next attempt at an altcoin was a success. He launched Litecoin in October 2011, combining code from the bitcoin client to eliminate the bug that helped to kill Fairbrix. There were some key differences to Bitcoin, however. Instead of having a maximum of 21 million coins, Litecoin had 84 million. It also incorporated the Scrypt proof of work from Tenebrix, designed to make mining more democratic.  Fair and transparent  Fairness is a frequent theme in Lee’s discussions about cryptocurrencies (which isn’t surprising, given the name of his first attempt). Proof of work algorithms play into this. “When bitcoin started, it was fair,” he says, because people could mine it profitably with CPUs. Then, as GPUs emerged, this became more difficult. “When Litecoin was launched it was CPU only. Then a year later, someone figured out that they can use GPUs to mine it also. That's the current state,” he says, adding that he expects to see it move to ASICs in time. “Currently, some think that Litecoin is more fair because there's no Litecoin ASIC but it may just be a matter of time,” he warns.  “For Bitcoin, the ASIC machines blow away the GPUs in terms of efficiency. But for Litecoin, the Scrypt algorithm won’t see as drastic a difference. You will eventually see it happen, though.”  It was his new approach to launching Litecoin, rather than the technology behind it, that made it less susceptible to 51% attacks. He launched the source code a week before announcing the genesis block that would begin delivering Litecoins to miners. During that week, he encouraged people to mine on Testnet (effectively a testing ground for altcoins, which doesn’t generate any rewards, or add blocks to a live chain).  “Because of that, a bunch of people built up hype around the coin, talked about how it’s fair, and based around bitcoin, had four times the coins, was a lot faster, and used Scrypt,” he said By the time he set up the genesis block, the hash rate was strong enough to make a 51% attack much harder.  A complementary relationship  Lee considers his relationship with the Bitcoin development team to be healthy. “We do talk every now and then to exchange ideas and help each other out. We're on fairly good terms,” he says. However, culturally speaking, his altcoin has one significant advantage over Bitcoin.  “The bitcoin market is worth $2bn, so they don't want to make any big changes that could lose them a lot of money. We are able to take more risk. Our community is smaller, so it's easier for us to convince a large proportion of people to upgrade.” It’s harder for Bitcoin miners to do that, he points out.  “There are a lot of things that require a hard fork and Bitcoin is wary of that,” he explains. Consequently, the Bitcoin developers sometimes talk to the Litecoin team to see if it will consider an experimental feature for its altcoin, if they are unwilling to take the risk.  There are interesting features such as Zerocoin that could be added to the core Litecoin protocol, he says, but another often-lauded feature, coloured coins, isn’t on his immediate agenda.  Marking coins mathematically so that they can be used as tokens for other things such as physical property and stocks is an interesting concept, he admits. “But right now, it's a bit too technical for the average person. Using bitcoin and litecoin to buy stuff online is complex enough,” he argues. “Adding coloured coins on top of that totally confuses people.”  In any case, there are other, more pressing features. The Litecoin team is presently considering smarter transaction fees. “Fees are pretty static right now,” Lee says. Earlier this year, it adjusted its minimum fee from .1 LTC to .02 LTC, partly in response to the growing value of the coin. But he thinks that the transaction fees should vary with the value of the transaction. “We're thinking about ways to make it smart, where the fees would reduce automatically,” he says. “That would be beneficial for merchants.”  Getting merchants on board  Merchant adoption is a holy grail for most altcoins. Until merchants begin using a coin ubiquitously, it’s hard to get it out of the speculation phase and into a cycle where it is consistently and widely circulated, with the liquidity benefits that this brings. Merchant adoption is directly linked to volatility – the more merchants that take a coin, the more it is spent. The more it is spent (and the more liquidity it has), the less volatile the pricing will be.  “The nice thing about us is that we're very similar to bitcoin, so if merchants accept coins for merchandise, it will also be easy for them to accept litecoins,” he suggests. He’s happy to ride Satoshi’s coattails in the meantime.  “Litecoin is two years behind bitcoin in terms of our adoption, so it's interesting to look into the future,” he says. “If we don't screw it up, litecoin will follow on the coattails of bitcoin. There will be more merchant adoption, and it will become less speculative and more useful.”  One possibility is that bitcoin will be used for more expensive purchases, whereas litecoin will take up the microtransaction space, he suggests (which also explains his focus on variable transaction fees).  But before any of this can succeed, one of the critical features that litecoin needs is a good payment processor, he admits. “I have talked to a few groups of people that are working on litecoin payment processors.” Kojn (formerly LitePay) is one. There are other potential developments, too.  One big boost for Litecoin will be official support from Mt. Gox, which in spite of its recent travails is still the biggest altcoin exchange. In June, the exchange promised that it would explore Litecoin adoption for July, but it's running out of time. In any case, this doesn’t mean that Lee is a fan of Mt. Gox. “Having one exchange that's dominating everyone is bad for bitcoin, so I am not upset that Mt. Gox is losing its mojo,” he says. “Litecoin is becoming more popular and Mt. Gox has seen that they're missing out on making money from litecoin, and that's why they want to implement it."" Vircurex and BTC-E are among the exchanges that support Litecoin.  Those are some of his hopes for Litecoin. What are his fears? “There's always a chance that I could screw up the code and cause major problems,” he says. Given his experience with software bugs and Fairbrix, he cracks this joke with an air of unease.  After all, the bug that brings his coin down need not come from him. “There was a bug in the Berkeley database that Bitcoin was using, and that Litecoin is using right now, and that bug makes it possible for the same client to hard fork,” he says. “It's extremely unlikely but there's a possibility, and if it happens it would be impossible for us to combine the two forks. That's one of the major fears.”  This doesn’t keep him up at night, however. Nothing does, he says. Lee is working with his community and doing his best. At a market cap of 617540 bitcoins (at the time of writing) – second only to bitcoin itself – the dev team and the community that supports it seem to be doing rather a good job.
