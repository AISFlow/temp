42377682,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72z2x,1412528311,What's the Verdict? The Bitcoin Community Weighs in On Ross Ulbricht,"Ross Ulbricht has been charged with narcotics trafficking, computer hacking and money laundering. He refutes the claims that he is Silk Road's mastermind, also known as 'Dread Pirate Roberts' and he is currently fighting to prove his innocence.  I spoke with a number of prominent names in the bitcoin space about whether they think Ulbricht would be widely viewed as a bitcoin martyr or the ultimate cryptocurrency villain if found guilty. Here's what they said:                                When asked whether their views of Ulbricht were positive or negative, members of the bitcoin community were keen to share their views on Twitter:      @emilyspaven disagree with his politics but that's outweighed by how unfairly maligned / slandered he was by the FBI      — Crypto Cuttlefish (@cuttlefish_btc) October 2, 2014        @emilyspaven negative. It's probably mainly a result of the causal murder for hire thing.      — Gary Broadfield (@GaslanB) October 2, 2014            @emilyspaven @coindesk negative. Played fast and loose with law and now cries help me, help me. Stop manipulating people and deal w/ it      — Rob Jackson (@rcjackson) October 2, 2014        @emilyspaven just ask @FreeTalkLive he either made black market safer or he's innocent.      — Kevyn Levine (@kevynlevine) October 2, 2014            @emilyspaven positive. The #blackmarket only exists because of unethical state sanctions on #freetrade. He made the black market safer      — Shane Harris (@ShaneHarris55) October 2, 2014        @emilyspaven @LionOfNarnia Positive. Bringing choice, competition quality and ease to markets of huge demand and crappy supply (stupid laws)      — Chris Gallop (@peanutsrevenge) October 2, 2014            @peanutsrevenge @emilyspaven IF 'DPR' very +ve, same reasons as Chris. If not, more so for his quiet dignity in face of fed persecution.      — The Lion (@LionOfNarnia) October 2, 2014        @emilyspaven Regarding Silk Road, Ross is either innocent, or he invented a new safer way to get and use drugs. Murder-for-Hire? waiting2see — FreeTalkLive (@FreeTalkLive) October 2, 2014              As mentioned previously, Ulbricht is denying the charges against him and is, therefore, innocent until proven guilty.

42377670,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72yp7,1412520264,Tim Draper Says Banks Are 'Hugely Threatened' By Bitcoin,"Tim Draper is a well-known name in Silicon Valley. A partner at VC firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson and prominent backer of Internet startups like Skype and Hotmail, Draper has helped show just how powerful the Internet can be for the US economy.  Today, Draper is just as enthusiastic about bitcoin, and his sprawling complex located in downtown San Mateo, California, could be considered a central hub of US bitcoin innovation.  The site is the headquarters of the Draper University school for entrepreneurship, which is developing a 'Bitcoin 101' course, the monthly BitPanel event as well as Boost VC, an incubator run by his son Adam Draper that boasts 17 bitcoin startups in its current batch.  Further, Hero City is located in the same facility, a co-working space where startups migrate after graduating Boost VC or other Silicon Valley-area accelerators.  Unsurprisingly, Draper told CoinDesk he believes there is a gigantic market opportunity for bitcoin as a financial technology:  “I think that there's a really good market for transparency in finance, and I think bitcoin allows that.”  Discovering digital currencies  Draper told CoinDesk that he had long been looking for an opportunity to get involved with virtual money, preceding even the bitcoin era.  His first real exposure to virtual currency was in Korea in the early 2000s. There, South Koreans were already playing online games and using virtual currencies to buy things like in-game swords or other digital items.   Draper described his fervor and ambition to get involved with virtual money:  “I got excited about it. I kept looking around for an opportunity to create virtual currencies in games or whatever, and never found one where I was really jumping up and down.”  Later, Draper would learn of bitcoin, a virtual currency not restricted to any game or online world.  “[Bitcoin] was the first one that actually opened [virtual currencies] up to everybody,” Draper said. “It made it something you could build an ecosystem around.”  Draper’s first investment was in CoinLab, an early and still active company in the space that is attempting to make digital currencies more accessible.  Despite seeing the potential in South Korea early on, Draper said that his son Adam was actually the first in the family to jump on the bitcoin bandwagon.  He also added:  “[Adam] funded Coinbase, and I passed. Stupid, but ...”  Recognizing the phenomenon  Perhaps most notably for the digital currency's investors, Draper is not backing down from his prediction that 1 BTC will hit $10,000 within three years.  Draper is one of the most prominent investors in bitcoin, and was famously the highest bidder for a lot of almost 30,000 BTC seized from defunct online black market Silk Road at a government auction this summer.  “I think it’s a big and exciting time. I think we’ve got great things happening. I said three years, $10,000. I believe it,” Draper said.  Core to this belief, he says, is that he can see from his office in San Mateo the beginnings of a booming bitcoin industry:  “People are building real infrastructure around it, and it’s doing real work. It is speeding up currency velocity around the world. The movement of bitcoin is faster than the movement of any other currency. If you can speed up the currency, you can make the world wealthier.""  Still, if bitcoin is at such a high valuation in the future, there is the argument that everyday consumers will be dissuaded from using it.  However, Draper disagrees:  “They’ll probably measure it in satoshis or in smaller units. They won’t really think in terms of bitcoin. A $10,000 bitcoin, nobody’s going own a full bitcoin.”  Tapping a global potential  Draper told CoinDesk he decided to purchase all of the bitcoin at auction because of its potential to compete with fiat money around the globe.  “I invested to create an opportunity for international markets to thrive where there are bad currencies,” he noted  The use case for bitcoin in underdeveloped economies might be different than in the US or other developed nations. For example, bitcoin may face challenges with competition by the dollar in America because it is widely considered a strong currency.  Even so, Draper is a strong advocate for US regulators warming up to bitcoin, saying:  “I think the US better grab this opportunity. A light touch governance will allow bitcoin to be an enormous success here in the US the way the Internet was an enormous success.”  The consequences of not seizing the moment for bitcoin in the US could be dire, according to Draper.  “The US has to allow bitcoin to thrive here,” he said. “Or we’re going to be stuck with antiquated currency, we are not going to have the benefit of the jobs and wealth that’s created around bitcoin.”  Fixing banking issues  Still, despite the technology's promise, some bitcoin startups have expressed exasperation at the difficult banking situation they face. Draper said he understands why banks are behaving in this manner.  ""It’s not in their best interest,"" he said. ""Banks make a ton of money on credit cards, on wire transfers. They are hugely threatened. So they don’t want to bank bitcoin. They are kind of trying to hold the line.""  However, Draper was adamant that banks will ultimately pay the price for their slow adoption of bitcoin, stating:  ""If I were a bank, I’d buy a bunch of bitcoin. You have two choices: In effect have the train run just right into the wall, or you can change the wall. You go out and buy some bitcoin, you start banking bitcoin, and you start getting in front of it. You start creating new services with bitcoin. The banks who do are going to win.""  ""The banks who don’t are going to go the way of the buggy manufacturer,"" he added.  In Draper's mind, there's simply no turning back now. Bitcoin, he believes is here to stay. He concluded:  ""There are real businesses transferring real money through bitcoin and they are getting more and more used to it – cheaper, faster, better.""

42377677,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72yu9,1412514314,"Greenpeace: Bitcoin Helps Us Promote Free Speech, Independence","Greenpeace, a non-governmental campaigning organisation focused on environmental issues, announced it would begin accepting bitcoin donations last month, becoming the latest not-for-profit group to embrace the digital currency.  The move, which followed a similar announcement by United Way, is especially notable because Greenpeace does not accept donations from governments or corporations – it relies largely on small donations from the public.  CoinDesk spoke with Greenpeace chief information officer Tom Camerlinck, who explained that there were many “practical things” that motivated the organisation to adopt bitcoin into its fundraising efforts – things like lower transaction fees, the privacy of its donors and having a payment channel that allows the fraud and security team to worry less.  Camerlinck explained to CoinDesk that due to the nature of its donor base, the organisation strives to diversify and add different communities into the mix of people that funds its work.  “We like to stay nimble and go after what we see is the next major thing that's going to make the biggest difference,” he said.  In learning about bitcoin, though, it became evident that the community values seemed very much aligned with those of Greenpeace, he said, citing privacy as a frequent concern of its donors as well as independence, free speech, sustainability and “taking chances on innovation”.  Fighting corporations  When asked why Greenpeace chose BitPay as its payments processor, Camerlinck said: “We are Greenpeace and part of our independence is that we don't tend to promote corporations because we spend a lot of time fighting corporations.”  He made no mention of BitPay’s competitors; namely Coinbase, whose merchant base includes corporate giants like Dell, Dish Network, Expedia and PayPal.  He added:  “Independence is really important to our donors and our supporters. They understand that money can directly or indirectly influence campaigns or actions of nonprofits. […] That's important to our independence.”  Referring to the organisation’s goals of net neutrality, privacy, free speech and anti-government spying, Camerlinck said that free speech is an especially serious issue for Greenpeace.  “We take our free speech pretty seriously and we exercise our free speech quite a bit and its part of our campaign style,” he said. “I think that's where a lot of the overlap is.”  Not excluding Greenpeace’s environmental focus, he concluded: “There’s the sustainability issue. The environment is everyone’s issue. We’re going to have an overlap if you live on this planet.”  Beginning steps  Greenpeace has many ongoing projects in countries and regions that many would argue have a much greater use case for bitcoin than the US and other developed areas. Right now, bitcoin fundraising is available only in the US due to the structure and separation of its regional operations.  While there isn’t a worldwide donation page, Camerlinck said he “would encourage” its other regional divisions to follow the US’s lead on bitcoin integration.  “If there’s an opportunity to do something innovative and be one of the first out of the door – anything that's going to get more money for the mission, more people on the streets making change and doing good for the environment – we try to do that.”  Greenpeace doesn’t do a lot of directed donations, so any they do receive in bitcoin will go to its general fund, which Camerlinck explained is to avoid having money tangled up in various reserves when it needs access to it.  For the time being, the organisation will convert all bitcoin funds back into dollars. Joking that Greenpeace sometimes takes liberties with the law, Camerlinck explained that it is very conservative about its internal financial dealings and isn’t ready to commit to bitcoin beyond its current engagement.
