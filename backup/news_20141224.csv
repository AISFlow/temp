42398101,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbMA4H,1419436312,Review: Brawker Let's You Buy 'Almost Anything' with Bitcoin,"Name: Brawker  What it is: Brawker is a site that offers discount shopping at all legitimate web retailers. The firm says users can buy ""almost anything"" online with bitcoin. It also enables people to semi-anonymously purchase bitcoin by shopping for others with their credit/debit cards or PayPal.  Who’s behind it: Co-founder and CEO Cyril Houri previously founded Infosplit, the first company to provide geolocation based on IP address, and Navizon, a firm specialising in wireless geolocation. He designed and patented some of the technology that is now commonly used to geolocate website visitors. He remains chairman of Navizon.    Cost: 1% of transaction for each of the two parties.    Date launched: April 2014.  Summary: Brawker provides a very useful service for those who want to spend their bitcoins online. It's easy to use, but it is a lengthy process, so not ideal for the time-strapped.  CoinDesk rating: 4/5        The basics  Brawker is an online marketplace that matches people who want to buy bitcoin with others who want to purchase items online with bitcoin and gain a discount for doing so.  To sum it up as simply as possible, Alice, say, has seen a $50 scarf online and wants to buy it using bitcoin, but the site doesn’t accept payment in digital currency.  On Brawker, a user called Bob is willing to buy the scarf for Alice, in return for her bitcoins. And because he can buy bitcoins with a credit/debit card or PayPal without having to register his ID and address with an exchange, he is willing to pay a premium for those coins.  Alice wants a discount of 10% on the price of the scarf, therefore she pays Bob $45 in bitcoin and he pays $50 for the scarf, which is delivered to her.  Both parties have a need fulfilled by the service that can be hard or impossible to find elsewhere.  Using the service  In the interests of ensuring the service works as claimed, I tested it out from start to finish.  Placing an order  I registered with Brawker using a username, an email address and a password. No ID or proof of address was required, since Brawker claims it doesn’t have to observe know-your-customer (KYC) requirements as it is not a financial institution.  Next, I visited an online store that doesn’t currently accept bitcoin and selected an item – a bottle of sloe gin, which cost £29.90 including delivery – and copied the URL of the page the item was listed on.  Note, Brawker sets no official maximum on the price of a purchase, but the service is commonly used to purchase items priced under $1,000 due to limits set by the credit card companies.  Back on Brawker, I pasted the URL, entered the item price (including postage and any taxes) and my delivery address. Using an Amazon wishlist for the purchase comes with the additional feature of hiding personal details from the buyer.  At this point, I was asked to select a discount rate. Discounts generally range from 0–20%, as above that point there is little incentive for bidders to take up the offer. I opted for a relatively low proposed discount of 5% to encourage users to accept my order without delay.  Theoretically, this could have been the start of a bidding war between multiple bitcoin buyers, who can make counter offers until both parties are happy with the discount rate. For the sake of speed, however, I accepted the first offer at my proposed 5% from user ‘gmajoulet’.  Paying with bitcoin  The exchange rate between the buyer's currency and bitcoin is determined using figures from bitcoinaverage.com.  I sent the equivalent of £28.40 in bitcoin to a multi-signature address that acts as an escrow between gmajoulet and me.  Behind the scenes, there were three keys (in effect, passwords) to the escrow address I was provided with: one held by Brawker, one held by me and the other held by gmajoulet. All three are encrypted and two of the three keys are needed to finalise a transaction.  Brawker holding the third key means the company can release the funds to either party at the resolution of any possible dispute.  Brawker stores neither users' fiat currency nor bitcoin. The company told CoinDesk that all transactions occur ""directly on the blockchain, as opposed to being off-chain transactions on our servers"".  As a result, the company claims users' funds cannot be hacked through their service, as users are in charge of their own private keys.  Awaiting delivery  In my Brawker dashboard, I could see my bitcoin funds waiting to be released. Soon after, the bidder paid for the order and uploaded the payment confirmation email as proof of purchase.  Once the gin arrived safely, all that remained was to notify Brawker of the delivery, which enabled the bidder's bitcoins to be released from escrow. The entire process was completed in four days, the bulk of which was taken up with waiting for delivery.  I had no problem with my order, but should that have been the case, there is a 'File a claim' button on the site, which starts a dispute process arbitrated by Brawker and based on the information provided by both parties (including payment confirmation, tracking number and so on).  Depending on the outcome of the dispute, Brawker would either refund my bitcoins or pass them on to the bidder.  At the end of the process I was asked to rate gmajoulet and vice versa. These ratings are tracked on the public profile of each Brawker user, similar to eBay’s rating system, and give future users of the service an idea of how reliable the individual is.  Pros  Setting up an order is a relatively simple affair taking perhaps 20 minutes for someone with a little experience with bitcoin transactions.  Clean, user-friendly website interface.  Useful updates sent via email at every stage of the process helped keep track of what needed to be done to keep the transaction moving smoothly along.  Brawker enables digital currency enthusiasts to pay for items and services previously only available to customers holding fiat currency. Bitcoiners can pay for items ranging from groceries to electricity bills and parking tickets to student loan repayments, bringing the possibility of living solely on bitcoin closer to reality.  Cons  May not be so simple to use for a complete newcomer to bitcoin due to the slight rigamarole of using QR codes and bitcoin wallets to send and receive funds. However, most users are likely to have some experience.  Users need to monitor the process regularly so as to be able to accept offers, upload funds to escrow, etc. You can't just set an order and wait, regardless.  What if a 15-year-old tried to buy the same item with bitcoin, or a gun? Does this open up inappropriate products up to youngsters? The company says its aim is not to enable the purchase of items that wouldn't have been available to buyers otherwise and claims its policy is to remove items that have territorial or age restrictions, such as guns and alcohol (it also claims items made available via the Tor network are blocked). However, this obviously isn’t working, as I just purchased a bottle of gin without an age check.  See a video of how to use an Amazon wishlist to place an order:  Competitors  A service very similar to that offered by Brawker is Purse.io, but this is currently limited to shopping on Amazon.  Gift cards are another option for consumers wanting to spend their bitcoins. Companies such as eGifter, Gyft and Pockio let customers purchase digital gift cards with bitcoin (and sometimes other cryptocurrencies) and then spend those cards at sites like Amazon, iTunes, Spotify and many others. However, unlike Brakwer and Purse.io, these services offer no discounts to users – cards are redeemed on the retailer sites at face value.  Conclusion  Overall, the ability to use bitcoin at any online store is a huge step forward and the potential discounts offer an extra incentive to shop with bitcoin over credit/debit cards or PayPal.  The service is also useful for those who want to buy bitcoin with their credit card – especially for those that do not want to have to register with ID and proof of address at an exchange. However, they must be prepared to go through the Brawker marketplace process to get their digital currency and put up with the delay encountered with waiting for the item to be delivered.  The multisig technology, while making the service more secure and allowing a fair system for refunds in the event of a dispute, did not make the process noticeably more complex than a user would expect with a standard login procedure.  I should point out, however, that buying bitcoin with a card – something that used to be rare due to the possibility of chargebacks – is becoming increasingly common through companies like Coinbase, Circle and CoinCorner, among others, and the attractive discounts may not be maintainable in the long term.  Even so, Brawker’s service frees up people to spend their bitcoins where they like – a vital step if bitcoin is ever to go mainstream. This is a service that is of benefit to individual bitcoiners and the community as a whole. What's not to like?  Disclaimer: This article represents the experience of the reviewer.

42398086,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbM9qV,1419423918,Canadian Startup BitGold Closes $3.5 Million Funding Round,"UPDATE 9th July 0:00 UTC: BitGold has indicated that while it uses blockchain technology, it has pivoted from a focus on bitcoin.      Canadian digital currency startup BitGold has successfully closed a $3.5m Series A funding round.  Participants in the round included PowerOne Capital, Soros Brothers Investments, Sandstorm Gold and PortVesta Holdings. Notably, the man behind Soros Brothers Investments is Alexander Soros, the son of billionaire investor George Soros.  The Toronto-based company offers a consumer-focused Internet platform for global blockchain payments, alongside access to secure and redeemable gold for savings.  BitGold  raised angel funding from its own co-founders Josh Crumb and Roy Sebag earlier this year.  Blockchain tech meets gold  BitGold  says its mission is to provide “global access to gold for secure savings and transactions”, while at the same time offering digital payments based on blockchain technology.  Crumb said blockchain technology has already unleashed a wave of payments innovation that will empower people around the world by lowering costs and offering more access to safe and transparent financial services.  He explained:  “We see gold, the asset bitcoin was designed to mimic, as an important element in this empowerment. The flexibility of the BitGold platform allows gold to be a core savings account coupled with digital currency for seamless global payments, or as a natural-world storage and safety valve for an inevitable Internet of money.”  Gold in everyday transactions  Sebag, BitGold's CEO, said technological breakthroughs in decentralised payment technologies such as the blockchain and Ripple have created a historical opportunity to make gold a useful means of payment in daily transactions.  “Since my days as a professional investor I have wondered why there’s no easy way to own and spend gold in a legal, transparent, and tax-compliant manner,” he said.  ""True"" gold ownership requires the precious metal to be safely vaulted and stored, he said, making it extremely difficult to spend, especially in microtransactions.  He continued:  ""At BitGold, we solved this problem by developing a platform that is part gold exchange, part payments technology and part custodian, resulting in a powerful user experience that advances gold from a physical element to an instantly accessible unit of account and store of value for the Internet, an operating system for gold.”  Investors upbeat  PowerOne Capital Markets Ltd  managing director Pat DiCapo confirmed that the company participated in the funding round.  He indicated that PowerOne has been a major participant in the resource sector for years, providing financing and advisory services involving billions of dollars to hundreds of companies.  Regarding the latest investment, he said:  “BitGold is a disruptive platform allowing consumers to utilize gold for payments and savings, while providing a more efficient mechanism than any other solution provided to date. We are very excited about the future of BitGold.”  Nolan Watson, Sandstorm CEO and chairman, also confirmed participation in the Series A round.  “I am of the firm belief that with recent advances in payment technology, that we are the first generation that will have the option to easily and conveniently use gold as money,” he said. “BitGold, in our opinion, is creating the best in class platform to make that happen. We at Sandstorm are very keen supporters of their efforts.”  The idea of combining blockhain technology and gold is not new and many proposals aimed at effectively digitising gold have been floated in the past.

42398099,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbMA5G,1419419510,The 10 Most Influential People in Bitcoin 2014,"It's safe to say that 2014 was an interesting year for bitcoin.  As core development on the bitcoin protocol continued to strengthen the technological foundation of the digital currency, members of the bitcoin community had a significant impact on the 'front-end' of the budding industry this year too.  With bitcoin and blockchain technology approaching – but yet to reach – mainstream adoption in society, it's not enough that Satoshi Nakamoto's invention stands on its own technological prowess.  The bitcoin community needs influencers to spread awareness, build confidence and set precedents for the digital currency industry to reach its full potential. Sometimes these influencers dedicate their time, money and expertise to make a positive impact on the industry, and other times people have an impact on bitcoin for all the wrong reasons.  Whatever their intentions, CoinDesk has ranked the 10 most influential people in bitcoin in 2014 according to a number of factors.  We considered the year's biggest stories, contributions to the community and the companies working with digital currencies, and the answers of our reader poll – all within the broader context of the bitcoin industry and its growth in 2014.  Here are CoinDesk's top 10 most influential people in bitcoin this year:  10. Marc Andreessen  As an early pioneer of the Internet and creator of the very first web browser, Andreessen's bullish stance on bitcoin serves as a signal of confidence to other venture capitalists who may be interested in, but wary of, the digital currency. His op-ed in the New York Times titled 'Why Bitcoin Matters' and investment in Coinbase are just two examples of the mark that Andreessen is making in the bitcoin industry.      9. Ross Ulbricht  Although Ulbricht's arrest as part of the FBI's takedown of Silk Road happened last year, his alleged involvement in the online black marketplace continues to have an impact on the bitcoin industry to this day. Many believe that the results of Ulbricht's ongoing trial will set an important precedence in regard to crime and freedom on the Internet, and notable members of the bitcoin industry spearheaded high-profile campaigns this year to ""Free Ross"".      8. Roger Ver  Ver, an angel investor and proclaimed 'Bitcoin Jesus', may be best known this year for donating $160,000 to the Free Ross campaign; his promise to donate $10 for every retweet of a tweet he sent in July went viral and resulted in more than 16,500 retweets. Ver also works in business development at Blockchain and has invested in a number of bitcoin startups.      7. Ben Lawsky  As the face of the New York State Department of Financial Services' BitLicense proposal, Lawsky has been front-and-center in one of the most high-profile regulatory decisions in the bitcoin industry this year. While there's no clear consensus about the proposed BitLicense regulations, Lawsky has been open to hearing comments from all stakeholders and has made revisions to the proposal in response to suggestions made by members of the bitcoin industry.      6. Vitalik Buterin  Buterin is the founder of Ethereum, one of the more prominent cyrptocurrency 2.0 projects. In addition to overseeing Ethereum's pre-sale of its much-anticipated native currency 'ether,' Buterin was recognized twice this year for his contributions to innovation in technology: he received a $100,000 Peter Thiel Fellowship in July and, more recently, won a World Technology Network award.      5. Gavin Andresen  While he may not be as much of a public figure for bitcoin as others on this list, there's no doubt that Andresen's work in developing the bitcoin protocol and role as chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation has had a significant impact beyond bitcoin's underlying technology. Andresen continued to be a voice of reason in the industry this year and was a regular on the bitcoin conference circuit, helping to spread his knowledge and insight about bitcoin's often-misunderstood core technology.      4. Satoshi Nakamoto  While we still don't know the true identity of bitcoin's creator(s), he or she will continue to have an impact on the digital currency for as long as it exists. Despite attempts from people hoping to put a face to Nakamoto – including Newsweek's controversial cover story that named Dorian Nakamoto as bitcoin's creator – Satoshi remains illusive as a hero to many who laud his or her invention as one of the greatest of our time.      3. Tim Draper  Well-known venture capitalist Tim Draper emerged as one of the strongest supporters of bitcoin this year, and he certainly put his money where his mouth is. Draper swept the US Marshals' first auction of Silk Road-confiscated bitcoins in July, winning nearly 30,000 BTC. Draper followed his auction win with a number of investments in bitcoin startups, led Boost VC's recent Boost Bitcoin Fund 2 and scored another 2,000 BTC in the second US Marshals bitcoin auction earlier this month.      2. Mark Karpeles  The downfall of Mt Gox was arguably the biggest story in bitcoin this year, and as CEO of the now-defunct exchange, Karpeles had a critical role in how his firm's collapse played out. Karpeles was criticized heavily for the way he handled Mt Gox's bankruptcy and for what many perceived to be a general incompetence in running what was once by far the world's largest bitcoin exchange.      1. Andreas Antonopoulos  Widely regarded as one of the most trusted voices in the bitcoin industry, Antonopoulos continued to serve as an advocate and ambassador for bitcoin this year. In addition to serving as an advisor to bitcoin companies like Blockchain and CoinSimple, Antonopoulos spoke with government officials and organized campaigns this year to increase public awareness and understanding of the digital currency.      Honorable mentions  The following people received a significant number of votes in our reader poll: Barry Silbert (investor and founder of Digital Currency Group), Brock Pierce (investor and Bitcoin Foundation board member), Chris Larsen (founder and CEO of Ripple Labs), Daniel Larimer (founder of BitShares), Josh Garza (CEO of GAW Miners) and Patrick Byrne (CEO of Overstock.com).

42398091,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbM9xO,1419401077,"Stripe Updates Bitcoin Payments Advice, Will Go Live in January","Online payments solutions provider Stripe has updated its advice on setting up its service to accept bitcoin, saying the feature is set to come out of beta in January 2015 with a fee of 0.5% per transaction.  San Francisco-based Stripe, which allows businesses to accept credit card payments easily via the web or mobile devices, launched its beta test of bitcoin support back in March 2014.  The company has received $190m so far in six funding rounds, from investors including Founders Fund, Sequoia Capital, Khosla Ventures, Elon Musk and Andreessen Horowitz. It supports payments in over 14 countries and is used by several major companies including TaskRabbit, Lyft and Shopify to process payments.  Easy integration  Stripe emailed users who had expressed an interest in its bitcoin services on 23rd December and said on its advice page that accepting bitcoin should be a quick and simple process for anyone currently using its APIs.  Developers can enable bitcoin in either 'livemode' (with real bitcoin and addresses) or 'testmode', with Stripe sending three fake bitcoins to the test account once it is set up.  All API endpoints, dashboard pages, and reporting files support both payment types, it said. All developers have to do to present a bitcoin payment option to customers is enable it with a few lines of code in either Stripe.js or Checkout.  The consumer-facing interface looks fairly similar to other bitcoin payment mechanisms online:  Like other similar services, customers will pay in bitcoin but the merchant will receive dollars, as a hedge against price volatility.  Fees have been waived during the beta phase, and Stripe will begin charging the 0.5% per payment fee once the service is fully live.  New competition in bitcoin payments  Once out of beta, Stripe could become a major player in the bitcoin payment processing space. Competitor Braintree, a PayPal subsidiary, launched its own bitcoin services provider in partnership with Coinbase in September.  Stripe did not announce whether it has formed a partnership with any existing bitcoin payment processor or exchange to provide the service. This line from Stripe's user terms page (account required to view) for bitcoin, however, reveals that it will also use Coinbase:  ""The Bitcoin API will allow you to convert Bitcoin payment into the designated fiat currency via Coinbase and have your funds transferred into your Bank Account. The Bitcoin API is a technology layer that connects you to Bitcoin exchange and financial services provided by Coinbase, Inc.""  Bitcoin-friendly  The company has long been known as a bitcoin-friendly company and is reportedly seeking to provide the greatest possible number of payment options to users.  Since the beta service launch, CTO Greg Brockman has spoken out publicly on bitcoin's potential a number of times, saying it could ""unbundle the existing financial system into layers run by independent companies"", and that it may be the first truly global payments network.  Until better use-cases could be found, Brockman wrote, bitcoin had more potential in markets with volatile fiat currencies like Argentina than it could have in the US. A key to introducing new users to digital currency lay with specialist 'gateway' companies to make transactions easier.  CoinDesk has reached out to Stripe for more details on partnerships and user base.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/12/24/stripe-updates-bitcoin-payments-advice-will-go-live-in-january,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/15129c41a7c9bff1e8697bc2048f265870e79d91-1460x798.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
