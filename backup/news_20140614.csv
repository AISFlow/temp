42397699,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDrHV,1402751154,"Chinese Payments Association Wants Banks to Identify, Eliminate Bitcoin Activity","A new report from Chinese financial news agency Caixin says the authorities could be gearing up for another examination of third-party exchange funding methods.  The article covers an alleged statement from the Payments and Clearing Association of China (PCAC) – a national non-profit organization operating under the business guidance and oversight from the People’s Bank of China (PBOC).  The PCAC recommends stricter enforcement of exchange funding rules, particularly those concerning the third-party voucher systems that most exchanges employed in the wake of bank account closures in May. Technically, even these methods are not permitted.  The reported PCAC statement was supposedly issued on 4th June, and was the result of information pieced together from various online sources, and went unnoticed outside Chinese-language media and discussion boards.  How to stamp out bitcoin activity  A translation of the claimed statement indicated that the PCAC recommends banks to:  ""Periodically use a search of account names, and comments sections in money transfers, to prevent users from using their bank accounts to deposit funds in bitcoin exchanges, so as to effect a long-term strategy towards building bitcoin risk mitigation.""  It also mentioned price information as recent as 25th May, and so was presumably issued later than that.  The statement pointed out that while Chinese bitcoin exchanges usually hide third-party voucher sellers' account details, anyone can discover them by contacting the sellers via the QQ messaging service, or other communication platforms, and confirming intent to transact.  Multiple accounts  Sellers and exchanges are able to open multiple bank accounts, usually with personal rather than business details. As customers, they do not need to fill out the 'comments' section in a transaction to describe its purpose.  The PCAC recommends banks share information on these customers and create prevention tactics and blacklists, with a view to stopping all such activities.  Financial institutions should report regularly on how they are preventing bitcoin risks to the PCAC, as well as their techniques for detecting bitcoin-related activities.  Whether large Chinese banks would have the technology or resources to be able to implement such a system is questionable, especially given bitcoin's relatively tiny user base there.  No price movement  News of the statement had little effect on bitcoin price in China at the time, which dropped briefly from 4,180 CNY ($673) to 3,800 CNY ($611) before rising back over 4,000. At press time, however, it is 3,784 CNY ($609), in tune with the lower value worldwide.  The latest Caixin report, like others from that organization, was negative in tone towards bitcoin, leading some commentators to wonder if it reflected any official policy or rather the reporter's own bias.  It contained tables of the exchanges and third-party distributors listed by name and other account identifiers, causing some concern about the attention they were receiving.  Caixin is generally a respected mainstream financial news agency in China, and it has been responsible for breaking policy stories in the recent past.  Startups have had enough  Chinese bitcoiners in general, however, expressed tiredness at yet another media report of potential threats, saying it was of little concern unless it had a significant effect on price.  The startup scene remained robust and positive, said Eric Gu of China's first pre-angel investors' group BitAngelsClub:  ""We don't at all talk about bitcoin price, but only cryptocurrency startup ideas and investment opportunities.""  The digtial asset and currency-focused club last week held a salon in its native Shanghai with over 50 people attending. Regulatory issues were not on the agenda.  Gu said participants included startup teams, ""entrepreneur want-to-bes"", individual investors, professional investors like IDG Capital and pre-angel groups. The meetup was divided into smaller groups for discussions, where teams met with potential investors.  BitAngelsClub will hold meetings every week from now on, Gu added.  Bitcoin-focused online news show Yangyang.tv is also sponsoring meetups and events around China, including another one in Shanghai this weekend consisting mainly of mining operators and exchanges. All remain bullish on bitcoin's future.  Thanks to Rui Ma and Betty Zhang for their assistance with this report.

42397688,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDrAc,1402748120,"CNET's Halsey Minor on Bankruptcy, Financial Disruption and His 'Reserve Bank' for Bitcoin","Halsey Minor has long experience betting on, and profiting from, the next big thing.  In the 1990s he started CNET, took it public, then sold it to CBS for $1.8bn. He became a technology investor, placing bets on enterprise software behemoth Salesforce.com and telephony firm Grand Central, which eventually became Google Voice.  When the financial crisis of 2008 hit, Minor was in the thick of it. He fell off the radar as he suffered the consequences of recalled loans and acute depression, as he told Bloomberg Businessweek. Then he discovered cryptocurrencies, which he believes are the foundation of ""the internet of money"".  Minor's new startup, Bitreserve, wants a piece of the pie. It promises to let users exchange bitcoin for fiat currencies, and hold them in a system that's radically transparent. Every Bitreserve transaction will be published, along with public quarterly audits. It'll make money from low fees and investments, which will be open to public scrutiny. Effectively, it is Minor's idea of a reserve bank for bitcoin.  He spoke to CoinDesk about bankruptcy, Bitreserve, and how bitcoin can help avoid another crisis.      CD: How did you learn about bitcoin?  HM: I had read about bitcoin but I didn't think about actually starting a company until about a year ago. I had written an email to somebody talking about how the concept of bitcoin was good, but volatile money was not. So I was suggesting to somebody to start a company [in the space]. I ended up writing two full pages, all single-spaced, in the email. It was this long, long email. When I came back to it, I realised I had written that and I'd been so passionate about writing it.  I approached it not with the idea that I want to overthrow any governments or 'stick it to the man', I just looked at it as a consumer. If this is the Internet of money, how do I actually make something useful for the consumer. It's got to have real tangible benefit that's better than the existing system.  What's attractive about bitcoin?  This is the new Internet. This isn't like cloud-based software [for example]. There was an Internet of information, now there is an Internet of value. The new Internet might be bigger than the other one. I truly believe that. What's so interesting is that you can combine the Internet of information with the Internet of money. These two things compound each other. It's the transparency of information with the liquidity of money.  I tell people, 'hold on to your hat, you've never seen anything happen as fast as this is about to happen'. This is the first revolution since the first Internet revolution started. A real, honest-to-god, mind-bendingly transformative kind of thing. It has all the same characteristics. The early Internet, it was just for porn, it was for hate groups. You couldn't send money with it, but it didn't mean the Internet was a bad thing, it meant it was where it started.  You've had some financial troubles, declaring bankruptcy last year. How has that experience informed your involvement with bitcoin?  I know I wouldn't have had transparency as the ultimate business goal [for Bitreserve] if it hadn't been for what I went through. It's one thing if every bank went bankrupt and you're just an observer. It's another thing when you're part of the whole process and it directly impacts your life.  I came away thinking there is no trust system – not only should you not trust the system, it's in everybody's best interest not to trust the system. But the only way to have this is to have transparency.  The block chain is a response to this distrust of financial institutions. Unlike the banks, the government never showed up at my doorstep and offered to pay me off. And everyone says we're headed for the same thing all over again. For me, the bankruptcy wasn't conceptual.  If somebody walked in tomorrow and said they'd guarantee all our reserves, we wouldn't care about transparency. We'd go out and invest it all in super risky stuff and make more money!  So I was going to be transparent from the day I started the business. There is no way I would have started any financial institution knowing what I know now. I was going around collecting quotes from reserve [bank] members who were telling me consumers don't want transparency because it would just confuse them.  My loss is hopefully going to be finance's gain.  What are your plans for Bitreserve?  My goal is to take bitcoin from a fringe thing and turn it into the most disruptive technology that's ever happened. It's 100% consumer-driven, by building a financial services industry that's actually transparent and far less susceptible to the kind of shocks, where we don't know what's going on [in the banks]. We live in a post-trust world, the only trust we have in financial institutions is that the government is standing behind them.  I ask people, 'how much is £200 going to be worth in a week?'. They reply, 'well, £200'. I ask them how much a bitcoin is going to be worth, and they say they have no idea. So people don't want the risk, the anxiety of holding bitcoin. Even if it wasn't as volatile as it is now, even with 2-3% swings a week, it's more than people want to roll the dice with their rent money.  When I was at CNET, I wanted to be able to throw a copy of PC Magazine, which was more than 600 pages thick, under the door of my office. By the time I left CNET, the magazine was a hundred-plus pages, and it could go under the door.  My goal with Bitreserve is, when I go to an airport, I don't want to walk through it and see these places charging 25% for currency conversion. I want to walk through an airport, catch a flight, and be able to move my money from dollars to pounds on my phone, when I hit the ground.  You've said Bitreserve is going to be transparent to the public. How?  Probably the most profound thing we're doing is the 'reservechain'. It will allow you to construct, at any moment in time, an exact balance sheet for the organisation. It will be the definitive record of our obligations to our members.  So for example if we take our funds and buy US government bonds, we will publish that. And people might leave because they don't have faith in the US government. They think it's bankrupt, and so they leave. Because we start out transparent, we have to make certain decisions and we have to get our act together.  From what you've said about Bitreserve, it sounds a bit like a high-street bank for consumers. Is that an accurate description?  Banks give out car loans and home loans. We don't do any of that. We're a reserve, like a classic reserve. Reserves used to hold gold. But we're different in that we can't create money. We can't do anything that the reserves ended up doing, which is setting monetary policy. Our job is to hold something of value, so that when we tell you we have $100, you actually have $100. So we're never going to do car loans and home loans, but people can build all kinds of services on top of ours. Our goal is to make money free and easy to use.  You were involved in several different parts of the Internet economy before they became mainstream. Do you have the sense that you've been here before?  I come from the world of 'on-demand' – as an investor in Salesforce and Rhapsody. With Salesforce, people wouldn't believe that anybody would put any money into the cloud. Nobody wanted to invest in it, except me. Now, we've actually found these cloud services work and everybody's using them.  People want something that does what bitcoin promises to do. They don't want their bank to take two hours to process a transaction. They want to use money quickly and easily with all the fees cut out. But no one wants to cut out the fees and get this intense [price] volatility.  The idea of the Internet of money is incredibly powerful, and it has begun. There are now a set of standards which have been created as a result of bitcoin, upon which you can build things and which can become incredibly useful for consumers.  It's not unusual that all the pieces aren't in place now. At CNET, in order to publish on the web, we had to build a publishing tool to write the content to publish. Now, everyone's on free services, like Wordpress. It's a constant process of building the tools.  We're kind of at the very base level [with bitcoin]. But there's a whole bunch of ideas out there, the idea of people having more control of their money, cutting out fees, allowing people to innovate on top of money, it's an idea that's finally come. It's the last part of the business world that has yet to be touched by the Internet.  What do you think of government regulation of bitcoin?  We're not pushing against regulators, we just want regulations that are based on transparency. The block chain created a way to have anonymity and transparency. That's an amazing thing. Ironically, [bitcoin] creating a transparency system is probably going to be one of its most important legacies. It's all transparent, but the government is going, 'hold on a second, no one knows what's going on [in the bitcoin economy]'.  Where will the bitcoin price end up this year?  Because it's supply and demand based, it will go up. But I don't believe bitcoin will be the last coin we will all be using. We went through a whole bunch of search engines before we got to Google.  This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.  Bitreserve's CEO Tim Parsa will be speaking at CoinSummit in London on 10th-11th July.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/14/cnets-halsey-minor-on-bankruptcy-financial-disruption-and-his-reserve-bank-for-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6d2f64a7dbb439b3efe10e8954359f9c64837998-630x420.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397691,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDrCa,1402743611,'Eavesdropping' Attack Can Unmask Up to 60% of Bitcoin Clients,"Settling that purchase from Silk Road 2.0 or perhaps Porn.com with some anonymous cryptocurrency? Or perhaps you're simply completing an innocuous hotel booking with Expedia. Either way, don't be too sure that your bitcoin buys will remain unconnected from your real-world identity.  A new study from the University of Luxembourg has found that an attacker with a couple of spare laptops and a $2,000 budget could deanonymise up to 60% of bitcoin clients on the network, tying bitcoin addresses to IP addresses. Perhaps even more disturbingly, such attacks could be taking place currently, an author of the study says.  Network-wide attack  The paper, by three researchers at the university's cryptology research group CryptoLux, describes an attack on the bitcoin network that links bitcoin addresses to public IP addresses., which can be traced back to a user's home address, in some cases. The attack is relatively cheap to mount and an individual could launch it with the right know-how.  ""If I had a couple of computers , I could launch this attack from our office, very cheaply,"" said Ivan Pustogarov, one of the authors of the paper.  The researchers also found that the attack could be designed to prevent the use of the Tor network, which anonymises traffic. Additionally, the attack can 'glue' transactions, so that transactions performed on one machine using multiple bitcoin addresses can be grouped together.  According to Pustogarov, the attack would be directed at the whole bitcoin network, and would deanonymise 11% of all transactions at any given time. More IP addresses can be revealed by changing one of the attack parameters, but this would compromise the attacker's secrecy.  Pustogarov indicated that he had mounted the attack on the bitcoin test network and achieved deanonymisation rates of 60%, adding:  ""The range of success is between 11% and 60% [of all transactions]. The exact figure depends on how stealthy an attacker wants to be.""  The cost of this type of attack on the bitcoin network to be less than 1,500 euros ($2,000) a month, he said.  Ongoing Attack?  The kind of attack Pustogarov and his co-authors have described could be taking place right now, unmasking seemingly anonymous bitcoin transactions.  ""I'm running several bitcoin servers and from time to time I get many connections from the same IP address [...] I have suspicions that someone is trying to mount this kind of attack,"" he said.  Pustogarov stressed that he did not have firm evidence that such an attack was being directed at the bitcoin network currently, and added that he was motivated to prematurely publish his paper online, while it was being reviewed for presentation at a cryptography conference, because of his suspicion that such an attack was taking place.  The paper is published at Arxiv.org, a non-peer-reviewed platform for scholarly scientific and mathematical papers funded by Cornell University.  How it works  The attack described by the CryptoLux paper takes a different approach from earlier deanonymisation bitcoin research.  While earlier papers have focused on correlating users with transactions on the blockchain (Meiklejohn et al., Ron and Shamir), this method relies on analysis of traffic on the bitcoin network to expose identity information. As a result, the CryptoLux approach allows an attacker to view results in real-time.  Here's how it works. When you perform a transaction on the bitcoin network, your bitcoin client typically joins the network by connecting to a set of eight servers. This initial set of connections are your entry nodes, and each user gets a unique set of entry nodes.  As your wallet sends bitcoin to complete a purchase to, say, Expedia.com, the entry nodes forward the transaction to the rest of the bitcoin network. The researchers' insight was that identifying a set of entry nodes meant identifying a particular bitcoin client, and by extension, a user. This means a bitcoin client's IP address could be grouped with the transactions it makes.  An attacker would therefore have to make multiple connections to bitcoin servers on the network. Once connected, the attacker would have to listen as clients made their initial connections to servers, potentially revealing a client's IP address.  As transactions flow through the network, they would be correlated to a client's entry nodes. If there's a match, then the attacker would know a transaction originated from a particular client.  An attacker can take the extra step of preventing Tor or other anonymity services from connecting to the bitcoin network to ensure that only genuine IP addresses are exposed.  ""Even if you're sharing an office [with other users], these eight entry nodes, they will be different for you and someone else in the same office. This allows us to distinguish two people behind the same [Internet service provider],"" Pustogarov said.  Who's being identified  If Pustogarov's hunch is right and someone is identifying bitcoin addresses at network scale, just how much information could the attacker potentially be gathering?  A good portion of bitcoin users need not worry about being identified. Web wallet users won't have their IP addresses exposed by the attack. An attack would only reveal the IP addresses used by the web wallet service.  ""Those clients are not influenced by this attack. Our attack will only be able to determine the IP address of the [web wallet] service,"" Pustogarov said.  However, he pointed out that web wallet users probably don't place a high premium on anonymity and security anyway, as they are placing their trust in a third-party service:  ""They are still exposed because they trust [the web wallet provider]. If someone wants to remain anonymous they shouldn't be using these services.""  The CryptoLux attack also isn't designed to expose the IP address of a targeted user. An attacker would require a combination of luck and patience to discover the real-world location of a specific bitcoin address.  Since an attack has an 11% chance of unmasking a bitcoin address, the attacker would have to listen to an average of 10 transactions from a specific bitcoin address before the associated IP address is exposed, Pustogarov explained.  Core developers' response  Given the ease with which an deanonymisation attack could be mounted, what is the core developers' response to the Cryptolux paper? According to bitcoin core developer Mike Hearn, nothing.  ""We knew about these sorts of attacks already,"" he said.  In a post responding to the paper on Bitcointalk, Hearn noted that several measures to protect against it could be too costly or slow down transactions greatly. However, he noted that an attack that disabled Tor, for example, would likely come at the cost of being noticed by users on the bitcoin network, and so therefore would probably not be an attractive option.  ""Highly visible attacks like that aren't appealing to all adversaries, like intelligence agencies,"" he said.  Bitcoin anonymity is fragile  Bitcoin's ability to keep users anonymous has been thrown into question recently. For example Blockchain's SharedCoin service, a coin 'mixer', was designed to obfuscate the transactions made by a particular user.  However, consultant Kristov Atlas revealed that the service provided little cover from a skilled investigator. The CryptoLux paper further underscores the cryptocurrency's weaknesses when it comes to maintaining anonymity.  As Hearn notes:  ""Combined with the recent news that the blockchain.info SharedCoin service doesn't work, I think people are starting to get the picture here – bitcoin is not quite the anonymous currency it was made out to be.""  The question of anonymity goes to the heart of bitcoin's potential. Both Pustogarov and Hearn describe the trade-off between privacy and performance. For example, Pustogarov suggests several responses to his deanonymisation attack, but each one delivers greater privacy at the expense of performance.  Transactions will either be delayed or require more resources to execute, Pustogarov said, explaining:  ""With an anonymity network, increasing the quality of service and performance always decreases the anonymity. The faster the system, the less anonymity you have.""  Hearn concluded by pointing to the essential contradiction contained in bitcoin's mechanics:  ""Privacy is difficult and privacy in public networks is even harder: bitcoin makes all data public, yet its users expect total privacy. There's obviously a difficult contradiction in there that requires a lot of technical smarts to resolve.""

42397706,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDrPN,1402739721,"Hook, Line and Sinker: How to Avoid Bitcoin Phishing Scams","As bitcoin becomes more popular and attracts mainstream users, scammers are resorting to tried-and-tested tricks like phishing emails and imitation websites to steal your funds.  Follow these tips to keep yours safe.  1) Don’t be greedy  Phishing emails targeted at bitcoin users have so far come in a variety of flavours, the most blatant of which involves a person ostensibly sending you their wallet backup file and private key and asking you to send their bitcoin to another wallet address.  The bait here is that you’ll take the money and run. But as Imgur user GreenFox detailed in January, the wallet file actually contains an executable program (.exe) disguised as a text file, that will make off with your coins should you accidentally install it.  In short, don't let your greed get the better of you.  2) Don't click links in unsolicited emails  This applies to any of the more popular bitcoin services. At their most effective, phishing emails imitate the branding, language and function of emails from well-known and trusted companies.  In the case of Blockchain fakes, the phishing emails have included everything from supposed failed transaction notifications to unauthorized login attempts.  Instead of appealing to your greed, these types of emails co-opt your concerns about security. And rather than downloading malicious software, these emails will more likely ask you to visit a website to enter your password, but both are possible.  There are two things you can do to double check that an email is legitimate.  Firstly, look at the actual email address (not the screenname) that the email has come from. If it isn’t from precisely the website it claims to be from, that’s a big red warning flag.  Secondly, don’t blindly click web addresses. Hover over the link with your cursor and the web browser will show you the real URL in the bottom left hand corner of your screen on the 'status bar'. Note that, in some browsers, Safari, for example, this grey strip may be hidden. Go to View > Show Status Bar to reveal it.  However, as DeathAndTaxes suggests on BitcoinTalk, “A good rule of thumb is to simply never click on links in emails for site which may be important.”  3) Beware Google adverts  Not a phishing email exactly, but the use of fake Google adverts to direct people away from legitimate bitcoin services towards fake imitation sites has been a recent concern of the bitcoin community.  The scammers simply buy an advert on Google AdWords that claims to be for Blockchain or BTC-e, two sites affected by such scams, but actually directs to a replica website. The scammers can then steal people’s private information when they attempt to sign in or register on the fake website.  Firstly, if you spot a fake advert, report it immediately to Google. The longer fake adverts stay up, the more likely it is someone will fall prey to them. You can report a specific advert here and you can report a scam website here.  Secondly, as a general rule, check a website’s URL in the browser before inputting any data. As user @juanjblog pointed out in a recent tweet, it’s pretty hard to see that the recent fake Blockchain.info site pictured above isn’t the real deal.  Stay vigilant  Hopefully, after reading the above, you are now a little less likely to have your bitcoin stolen.  However, keeping your bitcoin secure requires constant vigilance and a bit more effort than simply not clicking links on emails or dodgy ads. Try starting with CoinDesk's primer on paper wallets, one of the most secure ways of safely storing bitcoin.  If you must keep coins online, two-factor authorisation and multi-signature wallets are far more secure than those with a single password.
