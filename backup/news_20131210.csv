42397303,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapSND,1386699324,10 Bitcoin Startups to Benefit from Crowdfunding Initiative,"Simon Dixon and Max Keiser are joining forces to help launch 10 non-competing bitcoin startups on the crowdfunding and equity crowdfunding platform BankToTheFuture.com.  The aim, says Dixon, is to help the companies get ""investment ready"" by aiding them with their tax, legal issues, business plan, financial model, valuation, video pitch and marketing for their equity crowdfunding campaign, and take them through the initial stages of securing funding.  Dixon pioneered the development of equity crowdfunding, consulting the Bank of England, Treasury and Financial Conduct Authority for a change in rules in 2012 with the result that UK tax office HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) now rewards investors in companies that qualify for the SEIS (Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme) with a 50% tax rebate on their investment from income tax paid.  In addition, HMRC offers further relief from capital gains tax. In the event that the company is successful, there is no capital gains tax to pay, and if it fails, investors can offset losses giving them up to 86% tax relief. The team also changed the rules to enable investors to invest in businesses online through equity crowdfunding.  Dixon says that, in an ideal situation, the total risk for qualifying investors who invest in qualifying businesses is 14% of what they invest.  Dixon's beginning  Dixon got his start at TD Waterhouse as a tea-boy and climbed the ladder to become a Stockbroker, he then worked as a trader for investment bank KBC Peel Hunt on the London Stock Exchange and has a masters degree in economics as well as a short career in corporate finance. He has a passion for the alternative investment market and alternative capital.  One of the spin offs from his previous firms is ‘Positive Money’, a socially oriented group aimed at reforming the Monetary Policy Committee. Founded by Ben Dyson, it is the first national group to bring a conversation to the mainstream media about ending fractional reserve banking in the UK.  Dixon says he believes bitcoin and crowdfunding to be the perfect marriage, warning startups off taking loans from banks. He explained:  ""Banks have never set up a business. They are looking for a proven track record of cash flow. Forget about the business plan. Banks don’t care about the business plan.""  As director of the UK Crowdfunding Association who led the charge to get the regulators to change their rules, he said: ""In the past it was a criminal offence to pitch your business to someone who wasn’t rich. You could spend seven years in jail for doing so.  ""Not only that, but it would have cost you an additional £35,000 to get an FCA authorised firm to verify your business. Now, as a result of the UK Crowdfunding Association’s lobbying, for the first time in history, the UK supports the most democratized investment structures in the world, whereby any investor, no matter what size, can get shares in a company without breaking the law.""  Pre- and post-crowdfunding  Dixon goes on to say that, in his opinion, there have been two eras to finance for small businesses, before crowdfunding, and after. He said that the costs associated with starting a business used to be at least £50,000, with the founder being reliant on friends and family to help them out.  This has all changed with Silicon Valley giving us a global distribution network through Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and Skype. Also, the cost of starting a small business has been reduced to the cost of a laptop, an internet connection and a smart phone.  ""The hardest part is raising that first £50,000-100,000, as once you get to the Venture Capital level, raising money is easy,"" Dixon added.  This is where BankToTheFuture.com and Max Keiser hope to be able to make a significant difference to the lives of fledgling bitcoin businesses – by offering them the benefit of exposure, publicity and investment.  Keiser's addition to the effort is to give publicity to the startups chosen, however he is also launching his own crowdfunding initiative called StartJoin, which is based on rewards rather than equity.  A fierce libertarian and critic of central banks, governments and other monopoly institutions, Keiser started off in Wall Street and has always been a specialist in virtual currency and technology, pioneering the Hollywood Stock Exchange back in the 90s.  He says equity crowdfunding is unique to the UK, and that London is the world leader in tech.  “Some of the banks are starting to realize if they don’t pay attention to bitcoin they’re going to go the way of the dodo,” he added.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Richard Boase,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/10/10-bitcoin-startups-to-benefit-from-crowdfunding-initiative,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4db8235af1fcf8328d28472b5a1f84b7c8eee82d-1025x768.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397297,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapSII,1386696038,US State Regulators: Bitcoin Businesses Aren't Applying for Licenses,"State financial regulators in the US have received several inquiries about licensing bitcoin businesses, but few applications, it has been claimed.  According to a report in Bloomberg BusinessWeek, the commissioner of banks in Massachusetts, David Cotney, claimed his state has only received one application to license a bitcoin business to date, with other states reporting similarly low figures.  This news comes after the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) made a statement back in March that any company trading digital currencies would be regarded as a ‘money transmitter’.  In turn, it stated that these companies would be subject to the same compliance regulations as companies like Western Union and MoneyGram International.  Does this suggest a lack of enthusiasm for bitcoin-related startups, or are entrepreneurs simply deciding to worry about compliance issues later?  Maybe businesses think they’re too small to appear on the regulatory radar, or maybe they have dismissed US regulation as too complicated to deal with.  The regulatory 'grey zone'  Back in August, Japanese exchange Mt. Gox grew too large within the USA's regulatory 'grey zone'. Consequently, the US government seized $5m from subsidiaries’ accounts.  Next was Liberty Reserve and e-gold, whose founder narrowly avoided a lengthy prison sentence after pleading guilty to running an unlicensed money transmitter business and aiding money laundering.  Bitcoin businesses were playing a dangerous game by neglecting their regulatory obligations, said the Financial Times. Not only were they risking the wrath of government bodies, but they also made banks and other companies wary of dealing with them.  Decentralized bitcoin may not have any physical premises to raid or servers to shut down, but many businesses that use the Bitcoin protocol as a foundation do.  These businesses also need bank accounts to interface with the commercial world as it exists today, which may be closed by the banks themselves or emptied by the authorities.  Cost of compliance  Compliance, however, is expensive. MarketWatch reported Western Union's claim that it will spend 3.5 to 4.5% of its 2014 revenue simply following regulation.  The report also suggested that entrepreneurs might be unwilling to do bitcoin business in the United States, starting up in other countries instead.  Bloomberg BusinessWeek continued that other options for bitcoin businesses could open up in future, with New York’s superintendent of financial services considering something called a ‘BitLicense’ specifically for digital currency businesses.  Apart from FinCEN’s statements and last month’s Senate hearings, the US government has not made any public comments or rulings about bitcoin’s status.  Doing so could produce a flurry of license applications, or a potential bitcoin exodus.

42397299,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapSJH,1386692728,"Bitcoin is the Future, Not NFC, Says PayPal President David Marcus","Bitcoin has more potential to revolutionize commerce than near-field communication (NFC) technology does, PayPal president David Marcus said at the LeWeb conference in Paris today.  Marcus stressed he is a big fan of bitcoin and has a personal stash of the digital currency, but said the majority of people don't currently understand what bitcoins actually are, CNET reports.  ""People are confused. They think because it's called cryptocurrency it's a currency. I don't think it is a currency. It's a store of value, a distributed ledger,"" he said.  Bearing all of this in mind, Marcus said he's not yet ready to let people link their bitcoin wallets with their PayPal accounts. He added:  ""Whenever the regulatory framework is clearer, and the volatility comes down, then we'll consider it.""  While Marcus is largely positive about bitcoin, he doesn't have many kind words to say about NFC, calling it ""technology for the sake of technology"".  ""Instead swiping or using a PIN pad, they're tapping. How is that really better? How is that changing your life? People don't want that,"" he said.  Marcus wants payments to become more seamless. He sees a future where consumers won't have to visit a checkout to pay for their goods, they will use wireless technology to pay from wherever they are in a store.  ""Today a merchant has Internet connectivity at the point-of-sale terminal. All the consumers have phones with wireless networks. Why do you need to be at a place in a store to make a payment?"" he said.  Marcus concluded that, over the coming years, retail chains really have some work to do to reinvent themselves and their payment systems.  Just last month, eBay president John Donahoe told the Financial Times that PayPal could, one day, incorporate bitcoin. He also stated that digital currency is going to become a “very powerful thing”.

42397293,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapS9R,1386691223,Kryptokit Launches as Dark Wallet's Biggest Rival,"As secure client-side bitcoin wallet Dark Wallet looks set to reach its funding goal, a competitor has emerged – and is already shipping.  Kryptokit  , a wallet designed for secure bitcoin payments and messaging, launched today at the Inside Bitcoins conference in Las Vegas as an extension for the Chrome browser. This, coincidentally, was one of Dark Wallet's main goals.  The product, which is a reworked version of now-defunct project Rushwallet, features two tabs: a bitcoin wallet and a secure messaging system.  Launched by Anthony Di Iorio, CEO of Canada’s Bitcoin Alliance, the wallet can automatically locate any bitcoin addresses contained within a web page. Thus, users can make payments automatically, without cutting and pasting.  Di Iorio, who aims to replace Instawallet, an online wallet which was known for its ease-of-use, but also for its security flaws. Instawallet closed following a hack back in April.  Kryptokit's founder wanted to provide similarly simple service, albeit one that avoided storing a user’s private keys centrally. Thus, Kryptokit's desktop wallet was designed to store bitcoin addresses locally.  GPG protocol  As a Chrome extension, the Kryptokit wallet is an open-source project. Users can create their bitcoin addresses by moving their mouse around the screen. This, along with a random number generator, creates each user's address.  The system also has another tab, for secure messaging. This uses GPG (the open-source version of the Pretty Good Privacy protocol developed by Phil Zimmerman) to secure messages between its users.  Users generate a GPG key from within their wallet, but they can also import them from elsewhere. The GTG key can be used to encrypt messages that are sent to other Kryptokit users.  One of the disadvantages of this system, for now at least, is that it isn’t possible to email non-users of the software.  However, one of the benefits is that there’s no SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) header to worry about. SMTP, used for routing email around the Internet, is a notoriously leaky protocol that divulges lots of information about senders.  Integration with conventional email systems is something that Di Iorio hopes to introduce in time, using an Open PGP encryption system called Mailvelope.  Other future features may also include a social networking service to unite the wallet’s users, and a password management system to store login credentials for other sites. This system would only store them on the user's local desktop machine, however.  No server-side storage  GPG-encrypted messages reside on Kryptokit’s servers until they are collected by the recipient, says Di Iorio. After that, they are deleted.  ""Let's say the government wants to take down our server. They can take it. It's all encrypted and they wouldn't be able to see anything. This is why I say it's all NSA-proof,"" Di Iorio said, adding that GPG keys and bitcoin private keys are never stored on his central computers.  But where does this leave the Dark Wallet service?  There are some key differences between Kryptokit and Dark Wallet. One feature that the Dark Wallet team is reportedly discussing is a trust-less mixing service.  Dark Wallet project representative Amir Taaki did not respond to a request for comment from CoinDesk yesterday. However, at the time of writing, the company’s crowdfunding project had almost reached its $50,000 goal and looked likely to succeed, with a week to go.  But Di Iorio pointed out that the project was far behind Kryptokit, in terms of development, he said:  “They haven’t even started yet. They were getting together in Milan in the last couple of weeks to decide what they want to do. They are getting a wallet extension and they’re investigating GPG encryption now, but we’ve already done that.”  Curiously, however, there is some overlap between the two projects.  Like Di Iorio, Vitalek Buterin, a key participant in Dark Wallet, is based near Toronto. Buterin has also conducted a code review for Di Iorio, to help ready Kryptokit's project for its release.  In the world of non-profit bitcoin wallets, it appears many teams are united by a common goal: making bitcoin simple to use, so that its users can help take it into the mainstream.

42397295,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapSDN,1386685847,JPMorgan Chase Wants a Patent for Digital Payment System,"UPDATED on 11th December at 11:00 GMT  According to Business Insider, the recent filing is a renewal of a patent first filed in 1999, so this isn't actually a new creation by JP Morgan Chase at all.  ------------------------------------  JP Morgan Chase is building its own digital currency for use with digital 'wallets', it has been reported.  The banking giant filed a patent application relating to a “method and system for processing internet payments using the electronic funds transfer network”.  Let’s Talk Bitcoin claimed the patent application was actually filed on 5th August, and published 28th November. The application's abstract says:    “Embodiments of the invention include a method and system for conducting financial transactions over a payment network.      The method may include associating a payment address of an account with an account holder name, the account residing at a financial institution and the associated payment address of the account configured to allow withdrawals by the account holder only and to allow a plurality of deposits to be made at different times.    The method further includes freely publishing the payment address and making it available to users of an internet portal or search engine. The method further includes receiving data over a network identifying a deposit to be made to the account, assigning the deposit to the account using the payment address, and notifying the payer of the assignment.    At least one directory is used for associating the account holder with the payment address.”    Direct payment addresses, freely publishing such addresses for deposits over data networks… apart from the ‘account residing at a financial institution’ part, many might be familiar with a similar system already in widespread use.  In its lengthy application, JP Morgan Chase has avoided mentioning bitcoin at all, though it did allude to the fact that “new Internet payment mechanisms have been rapidly emerging”.  Of course, it could be referring to PayPal, or one of the many retail loyalty point systems attempting to become their own kind of currency. But the application also notes the drawbacks of these existing systems, such as the need to enter PINs, high processing fees, and shortage of consumer-to-consumer payment methods.  Before anyone says “prior art”, the application also mentions “prior art electronic Wallets”, but refers to software that stores existing account information rather than being self-contained.  Other highlights from the application include:  “A computer-implemented method of providing an anonymous payment from a mobile device to a payee device to enable an electronic payment between a payer and a payee without provision of an account number or name from the payer…”  and:  “payment message including a transaction ID; transmitting the transaction ID to the payer, the transaction ID permitting the payer to initiate transmission of a payment amount; generating a payment authorization message from the payer, the payment authorization message including a payment amount to be tendered to the payee and the transaction ID, the transaction ID allowing identification of the payment, thereby enabling redemption of the payment amount after the payee receives the transaction ID.”  Is this anything for bitcoin users to be concerned about? Is Chase, as the headlines said, ‘building a Bitcoin Killer?’  It’s no secret that the Internet, and the world at large, needs better payment options. The legacy system of credit cards and international wire transfers is being shoehorned into the Internet like Cinderella’s ugly stepsister into a glass slipper, often with the same unattractive results.  PayPal introduced the world to the concept of easy trans-currency payments, but also to those of account freezes, verification processes and 3% flat transaction fees.  But supposing Chase decided to use the patent to build its own cryptocurrency, would users flock to it? The initial reaction to Chase’s patent application from bitcoin fans was to point out a centralized system controlled by a large financial institution is hardly what cryptocurrency users want.  What about everyone else? Maybe all large financial institutions need to do is offer something identical to bitcoin, but without all the volatility, black market fearmongering and exchange shutdowns. Large banks, despite actions and events over the past five years, are still seen by most as safe places to store wealth.  Banks have also tried repeatedly to lock customers and companies out of the financial system for using bitcoin (including Chase itself), and perhaps having their own competing digital currencies would give them extra incentive to do so.  Holding a patent could also enable Chase to slow down or even stifle development of services relating to other digital currencies.  For those who don't understand decentralization or its advantages, a controlling hand might even be seen as desirable. Neil Irwin of the Washington Post echoed this view with his 'Bitcoin Needs a Central Banker' article in November.  Everyone from alt-coin developers to large corporations will probably try to build a better bitcoin in the coming years, and some users will be looking for one. Whether they succeed could well depend on more than just innovative features.

42397308,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapSPB,1386682830,Will Apple Dominate Mobile Payments with iBeacon?,"Apple's new product, iBeacon, is a technology that could change the way people interact in its retail stores.  Furthermore, iBeacon could potentially revolutionise how we pay for items: putting the tech giant squarely at the centre of the mobile payments industry.  iBeacon is a software and hardware combination that Apple has deployed in all of its 254 US stores. The software uses a brand of Bluetooth wireless networking, called Bluetooth Low Energy, to pinpoint compatible devices nearby. It communicates with customers' iPhones and iPads to work out exactly where they are in the store, within one and two metres.  The electronics giant, which is notoriously tightlipped on new developments, revealed some basic details about the technology to AP newswire over the weekend. It communicates with Apple devices to send them messages based on their location.  In turn, iBeacons can be set up in an exact location (next to a specific product display, for example) or within a particular aisle in a store. This works fine in Apple stores, because they have just a handful of products with a few feet between them. The technology just isn't accurate enough to work in places like supermarkets, though, where products are crammed in.  iPads and iPhones can be wallets and POS terminals  The iBeacon technology, which was introduced at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference in June this year, has so far been restricted to sending messages to compatible Apple devices.  Reports indicate customers are being encouraged to pick up online orders, read product reviews, and see what is happening at the store that day. All this happens via what the company terms ""in-store notifications"".  However, there is one significant element to iBeacon that commentators believe to be particularly powerful in the future: the fact that iBeacon doesn’t need specialist hardware.  iOS 7 devices  Because iBeacon capability is a part of iOS 7, regular Apple devices running iOS 7 and supporting Bluetooth Low Energy can be set up as iBeacons. Techcrunch points out that this enables Apple to turn hundreds of millions of existing iOS devices into iBeacons, with the user’s consent.  This means that the iPads and iPhones that are already an integral part of many retailers’ process can now be made to communicate with customers’ Apple devices.  In short, Apple has already flooded the retail world with iBeacon hardware. Every iPad, iPod Touch and iPhone since the iPhone 4s is capable of being an iBeacon if it runs iOS 7.  Forbes points out that Apple, having quietly installed a whole generation of POS devices at retailers’ stores by default, has also established a software infrastructure that provides all other key parts of the payment ecosystem.  In addition to the point of sale units at its disposal, Apple has other important elements of this ecosystem in place already:  Passbook  This system, launched by Apple in September last year, is Apple’s own 'digital wallet', storing everything but money. It collates users' gift and loyalty cards, retail coupons, tickets and boarding passes within an app on iOS 7 devices.  Support from major retailers has helped it become the fourth most popular mobile commerce app in the US.  iCloud Keychain  Announced this year, this service became part of iOS 7 and OSX Mavericks. It is a secure database for sensitive information including passwords, payment cards, and other account data. It replicates this data from the cloud to various user devices, including phones.  iTunes  Apple has access to 500 million credit cards thanks to iTunes, its entertainment and app store. It has created a microtransaction system that enables people to buy songs and apps for as little as 99 cents each, charging them for aggregated purchases via those cards – with almost no effort on the customer's part.  A history of market disruption  Apple has a history of disrupting markets by establishing ecosystems and capitalising on customer convenience.  It made its name in the music business by capturing the market for MP3 players with the iPod, adding in the music distribution system (iTunes, which it purchased) and then signing deals with the record labels.  It did it again with publishing, by offering the iPad as a device for reading books and magazines, creating a specific distribution centre in iTunes (called Newsstand) and then signing intimate deals with publishers of magazines and books.  Newsstand enabled Apple to control credit card information for subscribers on its publishing partners’ behalf, giving it a valuable asset.  The company now possesses all parts of the payments ecosystem.  Firstly, it has an installed base of hardware and software that can offer benefits beyond those of traditional POS systems (like the ability to find and communicate with customers in-store).  Secondly, Apple owns the storage and distribution mechanism that brings customers' retail information to them at the point of purchase.  Lastly, it also has the ability to let customers access their money from their phones directly, as it stores their credit card information.  Retailer interest  This may worry the likes of Google (with its mobile wallet app that needs contactless payment systems for in-store shopping) and Square (a company that sells a card-reading dongle for retailers to use with their phones).  Apple has already shown an appetite for making payments more efficient; dabbling with this capability in its own stores through its EasyPay initiative, launched two years ago.  This initiative enabled users to scan items with their phones in-store, pay electronically, and get a receipt sent to their device. This meant they could walk out of a store without lining up and talking to an Apple representative (apart from this unfortunate chap).  Retailers are already interested in iBeacon. Macy’s has been trialing specially-built hardware with iBeacon capabilities. That trial is restricted to pushing information to customers’ phones at present, though, rather than taking payments.  Apple now has the option to package a similar experience for its retail partners, who will likely be excited by creative in-store sales and marketing opportunities. The only question is, will it get the green light?

42397309,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapSR9,1386676866,China's New Rules: What Do They Mean for Bitcoin?,"A joint statement from China's authorities had an interesting impact on bitcoin's value last week.  The statement served as a ‘notice’ highlighting that “bitcoin is not issued by the monetary authorities”, and that it's “not the true meaning of money”. The release also states that bitcoin “cannot and should not be used as currency in circulation in the market”.  Let's examine.  China's growing presence in bitcoin  China has been a booming market for bitcoin. Since early November, the world's leading bitcoin exchange has been BTC China.  BTC China has just received $5m in venture capital funding from Lightspeed China Partners and Lightspeed Venture Partners to help expand its business operations.  A deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China recently told an economic forum that people should be free to buy and sell bitcoins. Yet, he also made clear that it would be impossible for the bank to deem bitcoin legal tender ""in the near future"".  Bobby Lee, CEO of BTC China, told CoinDesk his company has worked with various Chinese regulators in an effort to be compliant with China's regulations:  “We already consult with a number of local commissions and bodies in various capacities. For example, the securities regulation commission, the Ministry of Information Technology when we register a site, law enforcement if there’s a crime, that sort of thing.”  The government's statement makes clear that any “trading platform bitcoin internet sites” must be registered with the country’s telecommunications regulatory agencies. This is due to “a high risk of money laundering “ and “excessive speculation”.  The scam component  An exchange in Hong Kong, an administrative region that falls within China's sovereignty, recently disappeared overnight with $4.1m in customer accounts going missing as a result.  Chinese authorities have reportedly detained the suspected operators of the fraudulent exchange, which was known as GBL.  This could have been a major impetus for Chinese authorities to begin examining the impact of the cryptocurrency. Previously, the country had taken a wait-and-see approach, but GBL's scheme, which stole vast amounts of civillian money, caused the central bank and other authorities to take action.  That's why the actions of the world's largest exchange, BTC China, are even more perplexing. The company has only just made ID submission mandatory for bitcoin traders. Shouldn't this be part of its Know Your Customer (KYC) methods already?  An 'out of whack' market cap  China is making major inroads into bitcoin, which has been noted due to the infrastructure investments made into bitcoin mining there.  Those who understand the political and human rights issues facing China might be concerned about the country's influence on distributed money such as bitcoin.  Yet, no one can deny that news coming out of China frequently affects bitcoin's overall market cap.  It's important to note that thirty days ago, the market cap for bitcoin was at $4bn. In a dramatic run-up, it went over $14bn. China-related news has since caused that to deflate, and volatility remains a major issue for investors who see their bitcoin fluctuate wildly in terms of fiat value.  Exchanges need banks  Bitcoin's recent price volatility and the subsequent market cap fluctuations have both been grossly misunderstood.  As nice as it would be to believe that bitcoin doesn't require banks, the reality is that without them it is very difficult to exchange between fiat and virtual currencies. Travis Skweres, CEO of US exchange CoinMKT, is one person that deals with this problem everyday. Banks aren't seeing the opportunity, and some of that has to do with perceived regulatory risks.  ""The biggest impediment to growth in the industry is the ability to exchange between fiat currencies and cryptocurrency. It presents an enormous challenge to exchanges, but also an enormous opportunity for banks with an appetite for risk,"" Skweres said.  ""Show me a bank that publicly provides banking to bitcoin companies, and I'll show you a bank that needs to hire another 100 employees,"" he added.  Since the news on China's new bitcoin regulations broke, the price has started to recover.  The country's influence on bitcoin cannot be denied. If China goes, so will bitcoin. Chinese people view the currency as an asset worth investing in, either by mining or trading.  The question remains as to what the government's role will be going forward. This ultimately depends on whether bitcoin will be treated like a commodity, and if China's state-controlled banking system will let the currency operate within a legal framework it deems fit.

42397305,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapSFL,1386670539,Mt. Gox and AstroPay Team Up for Faster Latin American Transfers,"Mt. Gox  customers in Latin America will be able to deposit money from local bank accounts much faster, after the exchange announced a partnership deal with popular payment processor AstroPay.  The partnership enables users in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay to arrange deposits in US dollars to their Mt. Gox accounts. In turn, users can trade their funds for bitcoins within one (Japanese) business day.  Mt. Gox announced the deal at the Latin American Bitcoin Conference, held in Buenos Aires last week.  Customers in these countries can now select AstroPay as a funding option in their account settings, and transfer to Mt. Gox via AstroPay’s system from a drop-down list of selected local banks.  Franco Amati of the Fundación Bitcoin Argentina said that while the AstroPay option seemed to be functioning for the other six countries on Mt. Gox’s list, bank options for Argentina have disappeared after just a couple of days. He claimed that clicking the bank drop-down menu will display a blank field for the country, adding:  ""The option to use AstroPay with Mt.Gox in Argentina was available for a few days, but was later removed. The service seems to be still working for Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay, but not for Argentina's Bitcoin community.""  ""We are not sure what happened. Nonetheless, because of cumbersome regulations and bank issues with international wire transfers, in Argentina, Bitcoin users are already used to buying or selling bitcoins locally, using websites like Conectabitcoin, LatinCoin, LocalBitcoins or even Facebook groups.”  AstroPay is a UK company that operates in Latin America, enabling fast online payments in markets where more regular payment options, like credit and debit cards, are not readily available to all customers.  As well as direct online payment options, the company also provides AstroPay Cards with pre-loaded US dollar-denominated values for purchase with local currency. All transactions are settled offshore in USD.  It is widely accepted as a payment option for online merchants in 11 Latin American countries; the seven on Mt. Gox’s list plus Venezuela, Costa Rica, Paraguay, and Bolivia.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/10/mt-gox-and-astropay-team-up-for-faster-latin-american-transfers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fd3d5b518f034090b6a82044c5302baa248ec928-728x497.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
