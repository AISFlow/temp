12943284,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=535158,1685142033,Bullish Case For Litecoin Grows Stronger As LTC Halving Draws Close,"Litecoin (LTC) is still trending low like the rest of the cryptocurrency market but one thing that separates the altcoin from the others is its obvious bullish case. Unlike the rest of the market, Litecoin looks set for another rally which will likely be propelled forward by the next halving. Litecoin Halving Presents Bullish Scenario Just like Bitcoin, the Litecoin halving happens every four years and cuts block rewards by 50%. The aim of this halving is to reduce the amount of new supply flowing into the market. And as demand rises, there is less supply to meet this demand, thus leading to scarcity and a surge in prices. Related Reading: When Is A Token Coming For Coinbase’s Base L2? Here’s What The Roadmap Says The next Litecoin halving is now around the corner with only about three months left to go. This halving, like the ones before it, carries the same promise of a rally for the digital asset. The last halving in 2019 saw LTC’s price bottom out around $62 and then rally to a local peak of $80 in the same month. LTC halving will happen in August | Source: Nicehash If this year’s halving stays true to this trend, then the digital asset should be seeing some upside in the coming months. This could result in LTC clearing the $100 level once more as investors prep for the next leg-up. A 20% upside is attainable at this point, especially with the halving expected to happen in early August. So more than likely, the buyers will dominate the market for the next two months, leading to rising prices for Litecoin. LTC Outlook For 2023 Presently, the crypto market is seeing muted momentum as investors remain indecisive. For Litecoin, the upcoming halving remains a bullish event but the prospects for the months following the halving event do not look good given historical performances. Previous performance paint bull case for LTC | Source: LTCUSD on TradingView.com After each halving, LTC has seen a reversal in sentiment following the initial surge and the subsequent crashes have been more brutal than the uptrends. For example in 2019, LTC’s price crashed almost 50% in the month of September, one month after the halving was completed. This was because the bull market was yet to begin and the cryptocurrency fell back into lockstep with the rest of the market again.

The upcoming interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve (Fed) may pose the next big challenge for Bitcoin, according to the crypto market analysis firm Blofin Academy. Related Reading: Arbitrum (ARB) Fallout: 70% Price Drop, But These Charts Reveal Its True Value Is Bitcoin Ready For The Heat Of Interest Rate Hikes? The US economy has shown considerable resilience in recent months, prompting the Fed to consider raising interest rates to prevent inflation. However, this could be bad news for the crypto market, as higher interest rates tend to make traditional investments more attractive, potentially leading to a decrease in demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The correlation between interest rates and Bitcoin’s price action has been observed in the past. When interest rates rise, investors tend to move their money into traditional investment vehicles such as stocks and bonds, leading to a decrease in demand for cryptocurrencies. However, it’s worth noting that Bitcoin has often been viewed as a hedge against inflation, which means that it could still hold some appeal for investors during times of economic uncertainty. The next scheduled Fed meeting is set to take place on June 14, 2023, where the central bank will likely discuss the possibility of raising interest rates in response to the current state of the US economy. Macro Determinants Leave Crypto Traders Waiting Noelle Acheson, owner of the “Crypto Is Macro Now” newsletter, has cautioned against investors piling into the crypto market at this time. While the upside potential for Bitcoin remains significant, Acheson suggests that there is currently no compelling reason for investors to take on additional risk. According to Acheson, there are few macro determinants at the moment, such as debt limit negotiations and Fed rate policy, which are leaving investors waiting for more clarity before making any major investment decisions. As a result, there is a sense of caution in the market as traders wait to see how these macro factors will play out. Despite the lack of clarity, Acheson notes that there is not much reason for existing crypto holders to sell their holdings. This suggests that the current wait-and-see period is not necessarily a sign of bearish sentiment in the market, but rather a period of caution as investors await more information. Acheson also notes that there may be some downside movement in the near term, but the belief in a potential rally is not strong enough to warrant the possibility of missing out on any potential gains. As a result, there has been some buying and selling in the market, but not enough to significantly increase volatility despite low volumes and liquidity. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $26,700, reflecting a 1.2% increase over the last 24 hours. However, the 50-day Moving Average (MA) has placed the largest cryptocurrency in a narrow range between $26,200 and $26,800. This means that Bitcoin may struggle to surpass its current trading range in the near term, as the 50-day MA is currently situated at the upper end of this range on the 1-hour chart, making it a challenging level to breach. While Bitcoin has experienced some upside movements in recent weeks, the current trading range suggests that further gains may be limited until there is a significant shift in market sentiment or the emergence of a bullish catalyst.

Amid this debate, the price of Bitcoin is firm but lower, tracking below the psychological $30,000 level as bulls recover after posting sharp losses mid-this week. The Debt Ceiling Debate There are reports that there will be more discretionary spending on the military and veterans with the reduction of other sectors. Moreover, there are unconfirmed reports that the Biden administration will likely not fund the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to boost collection, as laid out earlier. Instead, the immediate focus will be to hire more auditors and target wealthy citizens. Related Reading: Bitcoin Up After Fed Rate Reveal, Correlation With Stocks Over? There are concerns that the Treasury Department and the United States government will default on their obligation as soon as the first half of June 2023. Even though highly unlikely, as the Treasury Department has said it will liquidate $119 billion of debt on that day, the market is watching how discussions pan out. Bitcoin is firming up after losses on May 24. As a deal is reportedly struck and consensus reached, politicians would once again lift the debt ceiling, sending mixed signals to the economy. Unlike in previous years when top cryptocurrencies were decoupled from the mainstream economy, things have changed as Bitcoin’s prominence rises. Will Bitcoin Benefit? BTC prices will likely rally if there is an instance of default brought about by politicians disagreeing on the way forward. On the reverse side, a deal that addresses concerns brought by the negotiating parties could signal confidence in the economy despite more debt on the table. This averts a crisis and keeps operations running, removing uncertainty and stabilizing the economy. In that case, the USD could strengthen, possibly reversing gains by Bitcoin bulls in the last two trading days. Still, the crypto community remains bullish on Bitcoin considering macroeconomic events and next year’s halving. After months of steady interest rate hikes, the United States Federal Reserve could slow down rate increments in the next meeting in mid-June. Their action could support the commodities and securities markets.

12939893,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=535207,1685131273,"Arbitrum (ARB) Fallout: 70% Price Drop, But These Charts Reveal Its True Value","Arbitrum (ARB) has been making waves in the crypto world as it recently became the 4th largest ecosystem in the market. Despite experiencing a sharp decline of 70% since its airdrop, Arbitrum’s native token has continued to gain attention from investors, currently trading around $1.158, down from $1.1808 on April 18th. Related Reading: Toncoin (TON) Continues Downward Trend As Bears Maintain Control Arbitrum Defies The Odds According to the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) researcher Deebs, Arbitrum has emerged as a major player in the crypto market, with its Total Value Locked (TVL) soaring to an impressive $2.3 billion. This puts it in 4th position by TVL, surpassing many of its competitors. Additionally, since the launch of Arbitrum, the value of stablecoins has grown by over $500 million in just two months. At its peak, the network’s active user base reached over 600,000, surpassing Optimism (OP), a fast, stable, and scalable L2 blockchain built by Ethereum developers, and nearly overtaking the blockchain platform designed to host decentralized, scalable applications Solana (SOL). Despite these impressive metrics, ARB’s price has experienced a significant drop of 70% since its airdrop and has had very little positive price action since. However, DeFi researcher Deebs believes that this dip in price may be a sign of a hidden gem in the crypto market. One of the main factors that make Arbitrum an attractive investment opportunity is its high TVL, user base, and liquidity. In fact, since its launch, Arbitrum has maintained the highest liquidity of all Layer 2 (L2) networks and is the third highest of all chains on DeFi Llama. Furthermore, while many other chains have a market capitalization to TVL ratio above 1, Arbitrum boasts one of the smallest ratios at 0.6. This means that the potential price upside for ARB is significantly higher than its competitors, making it an enticing investment opportunity for those looking for long-term gains. Additionally, ARB’s technology has been praised for its ability to address some of the key issues facing the crypto industry, such as scalability and high transaction fees. ARB’s use of cutting-edge technology such as Optimistic Rollups provides a solution to these problems, making it an attractive option for investors looking for a reliable network with great potential. Another positive sign for ARB is the amount of support it has received from major players in the crypto industry. This includes partnerships with well-known crypto projects such as Uniswap, Aave, and Chainlink. These collaborations demonstrate that the industry recognizes the value of ARB’s technology and the potential it holds for the future of decentralized finance. Related Reading: JPMorgan Predicts Bitcoin (BTC) To Revisit $45,000, Here’s Why Overall, despite the recent drop in price, ARB’s strong fundamentals and growing network usage suggest that it is a hidden gem in the crypto market.

Even so, on-chain data from Etherscan shows that there has been a steady increase in the number of UNI holders in the past two days. As of May 13, there were 369,646 UNI holders. Since then, the number has increased to over 370,100 as of May 26. During this time, UNI prices have remained stable but relatively high. Based on the UNIUSDT chart, the prices have found support around $4.9. However, prices have increased by approximately 10% over the past two weeks, rising to $5.4. Although the number of UNI holders may not directly affect the prices, there is a clear correlation between the demand for UNI and the increase in token prices. Related Reading: Toncoin (TON) Continues Downward Trend As Bears Maintain Control Several factors could have provided tailwinds for UNI, the governance token of Uniswap. Apple Jail Break On May 23, Uniswap’s mobile wallet was released from what Uniswap Labs, the team maintaining Uniswap, said was “Apple jail.” With this jailbreak, users can download the Uniswap Wallet, that’s non-custodial like MetaMask. Through this wallet, users can buy and sell various supported cryptocurrencies. This announcement is bullish because as more users opt for Uniswap Wallet, the demand for the decentralized exchange could rise, increasing its dominance and stature. While MetaMask remains the most dominant Ethereum and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) wallet enabling the storing and trading of various tokens, even using processors like PayPal, the popularity of Uniswap could see Uniswap Wallet gnaw market share. Presently, Uniswap Labs said their wallet could support the trading of tokens across Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum. Uniswap To Launch On Base? Earlier on, the Uniswap contributors proposed the deployment of the DEX v3 on Coinbase’s Base. Among supporters of this proposal is GFX Labs, one of the largest UNI holders and supporters of Uniswap’s expansion to other chains. Recently, GFX Labs voted for the launch of the DEX on BNB Smart Chain (BSC) and MoonBeam. Even so, before voting starts, the proposal will undergo a “temperature check-up” to gauge community support. If there is majority support, it will proceed to the next step. Uniswap v3 is the latest iteration of the DEX, introducing the concept of concentrated liquidity for higher capital efficiency and more return on investment (ROI) for liquidity providers. Base is a layer-2, open-source, and EVM-compatible platform by Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Related Reading: JPMorgan Predicts Bitcoin (BTC) To Revisit $45,000, Here’s Why It is unclear whether the above-spurred demand for UNI, pushed the number of holders higher in the last week.

While ether rose 1.5%, bitcoin moved little to recently trade at about $26,700, a little below where it stood last Friday.

While it’s widely expected that a deal will be reached ahead of the June 1 deadline, the two sides had yet to reach an agreement going into the Memorial Day weekend.  Markets were also weighing Friday’s Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) report showing U.S. prices rising more than expected in April. Core PCE, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.4%, versus expectations of a 0.3% increase.

42410577,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdfc6U,1685124612,Striving for the Impossible: Reasonable Crypto Debate,"Crypto in the U.S. is more polarized and politicized than ever.  Ironically, that’s a sign that the issues around this technology have become less of a fringe concern for ordinary Americans. With Florida governor Ron DeSantis signaling his fidelity to Bitcoin in his presidential candidacy launch and President Biden accusing Republicans of protecting “crypto traders'' during debt ceiling negotiations, crypto is garnering attention and, for that, is rewarded with the same divisive treatment as other mainstream topics. What should be a detached, technical discussion on the pros and cons of policy options is now laden with emotion and exaggeration, the upshot being that real public understanding of the technology’s promise and perils seems even less attainable.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  As we know from the wider political arena, social media is a major contributor to this problem. Provocateurs from both the right and the left peddle fear-mongering exaggerations about their opponents and simplistic bromide solutions. It’s a proven way to build the real currency of power of our time: online attention.  The result is a society that’s incapable, not only of compromise, but of even allowing space for an informed examination of the facts. It’s not that discussion is consumed by outright lies and disinformation – though there’s plenty of that – it’s that every debate seems unable to progress beyond a superficial state. A complex reality cannot be encapsulated in 140 characters. Yet it’s in the complexity where we’ll find truth.  This is the broader context in which the crypto discussion seems trapped right now. People either love or hate crypto, with strong but often ill-informed opinions. There seems to be less willingness on either side to understand the other’s position and little search for compromise.  If you’re reading this column, you’re likely a crypto believer. So, you might be inclined to point blame at politicians like Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) and at regulators like Securities and Exchange Commission Gary Gensler, whose uncompromising stances have played into an increasingly hostile posture to the technology from progressive Democrats. That’s understandable. (I’m guilty of the same instinct.) But simply doing so does not help. It takes two sides to create a toxic discourse.  The industry needs to figure out how to converse with its detractors. Less Twitter, maybe, more real-world interactions.  Politicization  In this environment, it takes good reporting like that of my colleagues Nikhilesh De, Cheyenne Ligon and Doreen Wang in a piece entitled “The Bitcoin Mining Debate Is Ignoring the People Most Affected,” to identify where both sides in the crypto debate need to cede ground.  The trio visited Dresden, NY, home of Greenidge Generation’s bitcoin mining operation, which has become a lightning rod in the wider debate over Bitcoin’s environmental impact and, in particular, the political battles over New York State’s move last year to impose a ban on new mining projects. They found that both sides have made wildly exaggerated claims about the harm or benefits of Greenidge’s operation. New York Assemblywoman Anna Kelles, a Democrat, has repeatedly made the false claim that the facility is heating nearby Seneca Lake and killing aquatic life. At the same time, many mining advocates dramatically overstate community benefits such as the number of jobs created.  Most strikingly, the piece cited Dresden’s mayor, William Hall, saying that before CoinDesk’s visit, he had never been contacted by a reporter, lobbyist or politician about Greenidge, whether they’re from the Bitcoin advocacy community or from critics who claim it’s harming the local environment.  The idea that an entire town’s multifaceted experience with an industry can be overlooked while the competing factions in a wider national debate create alternative, fact-starved abstractions of that reality is a true sign that an issue has become politicized.  As procedural gridlock has left Congress unable to pass clarifying legislation for this industry and as emotions have been stirred up by the ignominious collapse of big–time political donor Sam Bankman Fried’s FTX exchange, the bipartisan spirit that once existed around crypto on Capitol Hill has, sadly, evaporated. While there are still many supporters on the left, criticism increasingly feels like a Democrat position, while advocacy is owned by Republicans. Little good can come of this division.  Don’t be a troll  As I mentioned, blame for this lies on both sides. So, as a thoughtful, well-intended member of the crypto community, what can you do to help?  Well, for one, take a look at the forthcoming Consensus @ Consensus report, which CoinDesk will publish next month. It will be the product of a deliberate effort to bring competing voices together during our Consensus event in Austin last month, to discuss and debate eleven core issues for the industry and try to find a way forward.  More generally, we can all take stock of how we behave on social media and elsewhere.  Some rules of thumb: Don’t be arrogant. Don’t be dismissive of your critics’ concerns. And, most of all, don’t be a troll.  Prime example of the latter: the spoof video that Riot Platforms released in response to a New York Times piece on bitcoin mining’s environmental impact, which fed into a Biden Administration proposal to tax the industry. The clip, which showed an official in safety gear walking Riot’s Texas facility with a CO2 emissions reader to declare that Bitcoin mining released no carbon emissions, was satire. It was a way-too-smug-for-its-own-good way of saying we shouldn’t be judging choices for energy use, but rather examining the carbon output at the source of that energy – in other words, put your attention on whether a region’s grid uses either renewables or fossil fuels, not on how its electricity is being used.  The joke went over people’s heads; critics saw the character as an archetype of the “bitcoin bro” stereotype who ignorantly believes a mining operation has zero carbon footprint. Billions of people have extremely valid, urgent concerns about climate change and Bitcoin’s massive energy consumption is by no means an irrelevant issue. Did the Riot team believe that, rather than riling up such people, this Borat-like exercise would enlighten them?  In Washington, too, advocates should try to avoid baiting industry critics. They should criticize and articulate firm views, but do so in a way that gives their opponents room to find compromise. A letter from crypto supporters House Majority Whip Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) and Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.) taking SEC Chairman Gensler to task for not approving applications for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds was seen by one Washington insider as being a “red rag to a bull.” Why stir up Elizabeth Warren’s “anti-crypto army?”  If you count yourself among the moderate majority that’s open to compromise, resist the temptation to support the extremists whose overly loud voices rise above the din to be heard on each side of a polarized, social media attention-seeking rabble. Even when they’re pushing out those on-point soundbites, don’t hit the “like” button.  In summary, don’t be a troll and don’t feed the trolls.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MINING | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Michael J.

TON has been exhibiting a bearish strength on a monthly timeframe, based on data from CoinMarketCap. Within the last 30-Day trading session, the asset is down by 15,67%, indicating a high bearish strength with low buying pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: NUPL Finds Rejection At Long-Term Resistance As of the time of writing, the asset is experiencing a decline in value, as it’s down today by 2.76%. This downward trend has resulted in the asset, TON, reaching a low point of $1.91. The decrease in value reflects a temporary setback in the market, indicating a decrease in investor confidence. It also detects a shift in the supply and demand dynamics surrounding the asset. Toncoin (TON) Bears Maintained Their Positions Toncoin (TON) witnessed a sharp price decline on May 23, from $2.03 to its present value of $1.89. This price decline represents a loss of 6.89%. This decline reflects the dominance of bearish sentiment in the market, which shows a lack of investor confidence and a shift in the supply and demand dynamics. According to the market sentiment indicator, the current market sentiment is bearish, while the Fear & Greed index value is a neutral 49. Notably, a Fear & Greed index value below 50 points to an increase in bearish momentum. Conversely, an important resistance level is noted at $2.080, representing a significant hurdle for potential upward movement. Toncoin trades below the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The SMAs formed a Death Cross in the TON market on May 21, 2023. This confirms the bearish sentiment present in the market, indicating a potential sell signal and further price decline. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) momentum oscillator value is 40.98 and points downwards. RSI is a popular indicator showing whether a cryptocurrency is oversold or overbought. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hangs At $26,200: Why This Is A Crucial Support Level If TON RSI drops below 30, it may ignite high selling pressure and further price decline. TON Demand Index and Bollinger Bands Signals Bearish Activities The TON/USDT trading pair demand index is at -0.449, suggesting relatively weak demand for the asset in the market. Note that a demand index below zero is generally considered a lack of buying pressure. It also indicates that the selling pressure outweighs the buying interest. In addition, the asset is heading toward the lower part of the Bollinger Bands indicator. This suggests an increase in selling pressure and high bearish momentum.

42410575,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdfc9n,1685120166,"Binance, Other Crypto Players Shun Multichain as Bridging Rumors Swirl","Key players in the crypto ecosystem are shoring up their defenses amid growing concerns over the state of Multichain, a major venue for moving assets between different blockchains.  Four days after apparent technical issues started throttling some users’ ability to withdraw tokens from the protocol, wild rumors over Multichain’s safety and the fate of its team are filling the void created by the platform’s silence. A single tweet blaming some cross-chain breaks on “force majeure” has only added fuel to the widespread speculation that something is amiss.  The light-on-facts landscape is pushing a growing number of entities to mitigate risk now – regardless of Multichain’s true state. Their responses are highlighting how crypto bridges create the potential for a world of hurt that goes well beyond the flashiest and well-trodden risk to bridges (getting hacked by North Korea).  The situation is compounded by Multichain’s prominence among bridges. It is the third-largest bridging protocol by transfer volume and total value locked, according to data from Messari and DeFiLlama.  Like most bridges, Multichain uses a mint-and-lock mechanism to move assets between the 92 blockchains it interacts with. For example, if a holder of USDC stablecoin bridges the asset from Ethereum to Fantom via Multichain, the token gets locked up in a smart contract on Ethereum and then issued anew on Fantom – in this case, as a “wrapped” token called anyUSDC.  Multichain’s anyUSDC and other wrapped USDC tokens like it dominate 50% of Fantom’s stablecoin market, according to DeFiLlama. This is in spite of all USDC on Fantom being “bridged” assets instead of “native” that Circle issues directly onto the chain. Thus, all the USDC tokens on Fantom are reliant on bridges to retain their value.  This setup works as long as the bridge does. At the height of Multichain’s troubles this week, it didn’t, and wrapped USDC tokens on Fantom lost their dollar peg. Some arbitrage traders told CoinDesk they bought wrapped USDC tokens at a 30% discount during the fracas over Multichain, which is responsible for 80% of the stablecoins on Fantom.  Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, seemingly pointed to the risks of non-native assets Friday with a tweet imploring traders to “remember to check you trust the issuer behind stablecoins you hold.”  The Fantom ecosystem’s high reliance on Multichain hasn’t spooked market participants into a mass exodus quite yet. Overall numbers like total value locked remain rather steady despite some outflows to other chains, according to data from terminal-builder Parsec.  ""The multichain bridge is fully operational and safe with Fantom. Whatever is happening internally with multichain has no impact on the bridged assets on Fantom,"" Michael Kong, CEO of the Fantom Foundation, told CoinDesk.  Squid Router – a bridging protocol built on Axelar that unlike Multichain uses swaps instead of wrapped tokens to move value across chains – also reported a surge in activity during the Multichain madless. Bridge transactions on Axelar itself increased sixfold during the spike, people familiar with the matter said.  But Multichain’s method of wrapping assets to bridge them has spooked players beyond the stablecoin markets. On Thursday, Binance said it would temporarily suspend deposits in 10 Multichain-bridged tokens “while we await clarity from the Multichain team.”  Bridging aggregation service Li.Fi also took preventative measures yesterday and shuttered access to Multichain.  Amid all this Multichain's namesake asset MULTI has suffered. It was trading at $3.8 at press time, a 54% drop from where it was before the crisis of confidence began.",NEGATIVE,USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FTM | BNB | USDC,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/05/26/binance-other-crypto-players-shun-multichain-as-bridging-rumors-swirl,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e17ae271ad47f4737844a960353c88cbe97c932a-1600x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Worldcoin, which is currently in beta, aims to establish a global blockchain-based identification system using people’s eye scans.

42410576,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdfbwZ,1685120132,Worldcoin and the Intellectual Decline of Venture Capital,"Yesterday, the company behind the Sam Altman-fronted Worldcoin project announced it had raised $115 million dollars in venture capital. The raise looks like an atavistic last gasp for the kind of prestige-driven, slot-machine structured Silicon Valley fundraising fostered by a decade of cheap money. Because whether on ethical or financial grounds, there seems little rational explanation for supporting the project.  To review, Worldcoin’s pitch is essentially twofold. At its core is The Orb, a device that scans the retinas of users, so they can later confirm their identity online. The Worldcoin token, in turn, is intended to be distributed as a form of “universal basic income” (UBI) and is currently being offered as an incentive for early eyeball-scan volunteers.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  In just one of many missing premises around Worldcoin, though, it is unclear how the Worldcoin token can be expected to have any value for recipients once it circulates. It is extremely difficult to imagine how what amounts to an Ethereum-based meme coin with no apparent tokenomic model is going to be exchangeable for essentials like food and shelter over the long term.  That makes it easy to deduce that the UBI element of the project is simply window dressing for its real goal: solving the problem of digital identity. But in fact, Worldcoin’s approach to that problem is equally terrible, presenting a dazzling array of privacy risks and moral entanglements.  This duality is just one example of the deviously incoherent mess of motte-and-bailey rhetoric being used to pitch Worldcoin. The company’s messaging goes to great lengths to depict both a charitable project and an opportunity for immense profits (a deeply troubling two-step Altman also pursued with OpenAI).  It is the apotheosis of Silicon Valley’s dangerous delusion that it can both get rich and make the world a better place through the mass harvesting of data.  Exploitation is generosity  The danger of that self-aggrandizing mindset has become more and more clear as Worldcoin goes from proposal to practice. Even in this early stage, it is planting the seeds of global havoc and mass exploitation, under the guise of Western generosity.  MIT Technology review interviewed dozens of participants in the early Worldcoin onboarding process going on right now in 24 countries, including 14 developing nations. Their findings were damning.  “Our investigation revealed wide gaps between Worldcoin’s public messaging, which focused on protecting privacy, and what users experienced. We found that the company’s representatives used deceptive marketing practices, collected more personal data than it acknowledged, and failed to obtain meaningful informed consent. These practices may violate the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) – a likelihood that the company’s own data consent policy acknowledged and asked users to accept – as well as local laws.”  Meanwhile in China, a black market for biometric iris data has reportedly emerged among users hoping to join Worldcoin’s wallet app, and, it seems likely, collect Worldcoin rewards. According to sellers, the data comes from developing countries like Cambodia and Kenya. In other words, Worldcoin’s fundamental model is already incentivizing privacy harms.  See also: Sam Altman's Crypto Project, Worldcoin, Releases First Consumer Product  This isn’t just a moral question, either: GDPR in particular is a very serious set of laws, with immense fines attached to violations. And while Worldcoin has downplayed the risks, their reliance on an army of Orb Handlers to onboard customers means manipulations will inevitably continue. That completely undermines Worldcoin’s promise to solve digital identity.  I’m reminded of a ‘70s-era cartoon from a Playboy Magazine clandestinely acquired in my teenage years. The one-panel gag showed two lovers awkwardly entangled in hotel room bedsheets. Wedding rings on the nightstand imply they’re having an affair. The woman, whose exaggerated face conveys deep ennui, gets the punchline:  “Sam, darling – not only is this immoral, you’re doing it badly.”  The game is to be sold, not to be told  The $115 million fundraising round was led by a firm called Blockchain Capital. In conjunction with the announcement, Blockchain Capital general partner Spencer Bogart posted a short Twitter thread explaining the rationale for the investment.  The thread is cringingly vacuous and, intentionally or not, quite deceptive. Bogart opens by saying that he has “completely changed my mind” about his prior belief that “Worldcoin was some dystopian Orwellian nightmare” and a “noxious combination of hardware, biometrics, crypto and AI.”  But in the subsequent thread, Bogart offers absolutely zero rebuttal of those concerns. Instead, he simply argues that Worldcoin is “the most compelling solution we’ve seen to the decades-old [S]ybil problem” – that is, the digital world’s vulnerability to impersonation.  See also: What Is Decentralized Identity?  Given that he offers no reassurances about the downsides of this “compelling solution,” Bogart’s implicit argument is that putting the biometric information of disempowered people in the developing world at immense and fundamental risk is a worthwhile tradeoff for solving digital identity.  This is particularly regrettable because it seems to overlook a vastly superior set of identity solutions being pursued across the crypto ecosystem, by people far more genuinely focused on getting it right than Sam Altman appears to be. They include decentralized, privacy-preserving and user-controlled solutions that would lead to vastly better outcomes in the long run.  But they’re hard to explain, while Worldcoin’s pitch goes down easy – as long as you don’t think too hard about it.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | WLD,David Z.

12936744,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=535161,1685118003,"JPMorgan Predicts Bitcoin (BTC) To Revisit $45,000, Here’s Why","In a recent note, JPMorgan strategists have made a prediction, suggesting that Bitcoin (BTC) could soar and revisit its former trading price of $45,000 due to the rising price of gold. This prediction comes amid Bitcoin’s price action of a blend of bulls and bears in the past week. Meanwhile, over the past 24 hours, BTC has seen a 2.1% gain with a current trading price above $26,000. The current surge comes after Bitcoin previously fall that dropped its price below its previously ranging market price of $28,000. Bitcoin And Gold: A Correlation Bitcoin and gold have often been regarded as alternative investments by investors, and their prices have displayed a tendency to move in tandem. Given this, JPMorgan analysts note that the current gold price, hovering near $2,000 per ounce, implies a Bitcoin price of $45,000. This assumption is based on the idea that BTC will reach a similar standing as gold in the portfolios of private investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Struggles To Recover and Remains Vulnerable To Fresh Decline JP Morgan wrote in a note: With the gold price rising above $2,000, the value of gold held for investment purposes outside central banks is currently valued at around [$3 trillion]. In turn, this implies a $45,000 price for bitcoin under the assumption that bitcoin equalizes gold in private investors’ portfolios in risk capital or [volume]-adjusted terms. One key factor contributing to JPMorgan’s optimistic prediction is the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, scheduled to take place between April and May 2024. The halving mechanism reduces the rate at which new Bitcoins are produced, effectively doubling the production cost. The JPMorgan strategists believe this event will push Bitcoin’s production cost to approximately $40,000, acting as a lower bound and potentially driving the price upward. Drawing from historical data, JPMorgan highlights the bullish trajectory observed during previous halving events in 2016 and 2020. These events were accompanied by significant surges in Bitcoin prices, indicating the potential for a similar outcome following the next halving. As a result, JPMorgan sets an upper limit of $45,000 for BTC, indicating limited potential beyond the increase driven by the doubling of production costs. Reflecting On Ethereum (ETH) While Bitcoin takes the spotlight in JPMorgan’s prediction, the bank suggests that Ethereum (ETH) may face some selling pressure in the near term, extending beyond the Shanghai upgrade until mid-year. JPMorgan expects Ethereum to “somewhat underperform” BTC during this period. However, it’s essential to note that Ethereum’s performance is subject to a range of factors, including market dynamics and technological developments. Related Reading: The Best Decision Is To ‘Buy Bitcoin (BTC),’ Robert Kiyosaki Urges Meanwhile, regardless of JPMorgan’s prediction, BTC is currently in a bullish trend recording an uptick. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has seen more than a 2% gain, while the past seven days have seen a dip of 1.2%. At the time of writing, the top crypto currently trades at $26,823. Bitcoin’s trading volume has, however, ranged around $20 billion in the past 7 days, indicating a possible accumulation. Bitcoin currently has a trading volume of $13.1 billion in the past 24 hours.

This Week's Alpha  Go off, Bitcoin NFTs: NFTs on Bitcoin have continued to grow in popularity, jumping to the number two spot in terms of sales per blockchain, coming just behind Ethereum, according to data from CryptoSlam. Bitcoin NFTs are a relatively new phenomenon, as they didn’t effectively exist before the enabling of inscriptions on the Bitcoin mainnet in January 2023.  Space Pepes to the moon: The Bitcoin-based “Space Pepes” NFTs jumped to the top of the NFT leaderboard on Thursday, becoming the most traded NFTs over a seven-day period, data from Cryptoslam shows, with over $7.3 million worth of the collection traded.  Inscriptions boom: The number of Ordinals inscriptions spiked above 3 million earlier this month following the introduction of the BRC-20 token standard… but the vast majority are just text.  Nike’s jagged path to $1M: .SWOOSH, Nike’s Web3 collectibles platform, released its first NFT sneaker collection called Our Force 1 and has surpassed $1 million in sales despite a bumpy mint. The sale, which began with “First Access” on May 15 after numerous delays, faced multiple technical issues that hindered the user experience. The “General Access” sale began on May 24 – two weeks after its initially-proposed date – and also experienced issues with traffic and tech preventing many from minting. The sale is ongoing, but Nike has already deemed it a success on Twitter, despite the fact that many NFTs haven’t sold.  Drop master or drop-saster?: Some users were frustrated that Nike, who are experts in releasing exclusive sneaker drops that sell out in seconds, had so many technical issues with the .SWOOSH drop.  NFT lending is trending: NFT lending platforms and loan services are having a moment, as buyers seek new ways to enter the NFT market without shelling out thousands of dollars:  Blend: Earlier this month, NFT marketplace Blur launched its lending platform Blend, which has already seized 82% of the NFT lending market share, according to a report by DappRadar.  Binance NFT Loan: Top crypto exchange Binance has launched a new feature integrated into its NFT marketplace that allows digital asset holders to secure ETH loans by using their NFTs as collateral.  Astaria: Co-founded by the former CTO of DeFi protocol SushiSwap, Astaria allows NFT holders to lease their assets to traders who may not want to shell out for a blue-chip NFT in a single transaction.  Projects on the Rise  RSTLSS x Claire Silver: Pixelgeist  Who: AI artist Claire Silver and digital fashion platform RSTLSS  What: Pixelgeist, a 2,136-edition NFT collection, blends fashion, art and technology through vivid and colorful pieces of art created using artificial intelligence. The collection is made up of new artwork from Silver that range in edition sizes, with each piece portraying a “Pixelgeist,” described as “a digital entity that embodies the essence of an AI soul trapped within a portrait.” Each purchase came with an NFT, a digital and physical wearable featuring the artwork and a digital avatar wearing the specialized garment.  How: During the minting process, collectors were asked two questions that dictated what combination of artwork and clothing they received together. The collection sold out, though many are available for purchase the secondary marketplace OpenSea.  Want to learn more about Claire Silver’s art? I spoke to her last week about her upcoming sola exhibition at 0x.17 gallery.

Two more companies entered the market this week, Binance and Astaria, with unique offerings of their own and they won’t be the last.

Decentralized exchanges hold 9.61% of the total LBR supply, a steady decline from 23% two weeks ago, according to blockchain data firm Nansen. Nansen also reports that smart money wallets hold 4.74% of the total LBR supply today, an increase from 0.82% on May 16, indicating that savvy crypto investors are accumulating the token.

The whale acquired the SHIB tokens in two separate transactions marking its second massive accumulation within 72 hours. SHIB Token Burns And Shibarium Launch Likely Behind Accumulation Shiba Inu network and users engaged in massive SHIB burn events in 2023. The burning mechanism aims to reduce excess tokens and boost SHIB’s price. However, no notable price increase has occurred since the token burn events. Nevertheless, the top SHIB whales are accumulating the tokens ahead of the Shibarium launch and a possible price increase for the asset.

Shibarium is a Layer-2 (L2) scaling solution created for the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Its launch date is highly speculative, with several dates proposed in the past. However, LUCIE stated that she guessed the launch date would be in Q3 of 2023, while Shiba Inu founder Shytoshi Kusama projects in July. The exact launch date remains a mystery and LUCIE believes the Shibarium Mainnet Launch will happen between the second and third quarters of 2023. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: NUPL Finds Rejection At Long-Term Resistance Additionally, she believes that Shiba’s team remains confident about the launch, with multiple teams working on it and exploring Artificial Intelligence (AI) integration. LUCIE emphasized that the testing process is crucial and security audits are necessary before its launch. She explained further, that if tests go wrong, the Shibarium mainnet release will delay. Shiba Inu Price Outlook Despite the recent announcements concerning Shibarium’s launch, SHIB did not record much price fluctuation. It traded at $0.000009967 on May 1, 2023, before moving to $0.00001002 on May 2. However, by May 4, its price dropped to $0.000009896, losing some of its earlier gains. SHIB dropped to $0.000008695 on May 11, showing price volatility. The bulls attempted to rally on May 23, pushing its price to $0.000008899. However, SHIB met resistance returning to $0.000008519 on May 24 and is trading at $0.000008479 at press time today, depicting a 0.16% increase in 24 hours. Despite the price gain, SHIB’s trading volume is down by 8%, a possible signal of traders’ hesitation in the market. But the launch of the Shibarium mainnet in the ecosystem may be the price catalyst SHIB needs to reclaim its gains as it may boost SHIB usage.

Bitcoin Exchange Inflow Volume Is Tending Towards Losses Right Now According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the short-term holders are mostly contributing to these loss inflows. The “exchange inflow” is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin that’s currently flowing into the wallets of centralized exchanges. Generally, investors deposit to these platforms whenever want to sell, so a large amount of inflows can be a sign that a selloff is going on in the BTC market right now. Low values of the metric, on the other hand, imply holders may not be participating in much selling at the moment, which can be bullish for the price. In the context of the current discussion, the exchange inflow itself isn’t of relevance; a related metric called the “exchange inflow volume profit/loss bias” is. As this indicator’s name already suggests, it tells us whether the inflows going to exchanges are coming from profit or loss holders currently. When this metric has a value greater than 1, it means the majority of the inflow volume contains coins that their holders had been carrying at a profit. Similarly, values under the threshold imply a dominance of the loss volume. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hangs At $26,200: Why This Is A Crucial Support Level Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin exchange inflow profit/loss bias over the last few years: The value of the metric seems to have observed some decline in recent days | Source: Glassnode on Twitter As shown in the above graph, the Bitcoin exchange inflow volume profit/loss bias has had a value above 1 for most of the ongoing rallies that started back in January of this year. This suggests that most of the exchange inflows in this period have come from the profit holders. This naturally makes sense, as any rally generally entices a large number of holders to sell and harvest their gains. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: NUPL Finds Rejection At Long-Term Resistance There have been a couple of exceptional instances, however. The first was back in March when the asset’s price plunged below the $20,000 level. The bias in the market shifted towards loss selling then, implying that some investors who bought around the local top had started capitulating. A similar pattern has also occurred recently, as the cryptocurrency’s price has stumbled below the $27,000 level. Following this plunge, the indicator’s value has come down to just 0.70. Further data from Glassnode reveals that the bias of the long-term holders (LTHs), the investors holding their coins since at least 155 days ago, have actually leaned towards profits recently. Looks like the indicator has a positive value right now | Source: Glassnode on Twitter From the chart, it’s visible that the indicator has a value of 1.73 for the LTHs, implying a strong bias toward profits. Naturally, if the LTHs haven’t been selling at a loss, the opposite cohort must be the short-term holders (STHs). This group seems to have a heavy loss bias currently | Source: Glassnode on Twitter Interestingly, the indicator’s value for the STHs is 0.69, which is almost exactly the same as the average for the entire market. This would mean that the LTHs have contributed relatively little to selling pressure recently. The STHs selling right now would be the ones that bought at and near the top of the rally so far and their capitulation may be a sign that these weak hands are currently being cleansed from the market. Although the indicator hasn’t dipped as low as in March yet, this capitulation could be a sign that a local bottom may be near for Bitcoin.

Takeshi Chino, speaking ahead of Binance's re-entry into Japan via its acquisition of regulated crypto exchange Sakura Exchange BitCoin, described how volatility of crypto prices may lead to profit opportunities but will not help stimulate broader demand for cryptoassets.  ""We believe that stablecoins will serve as the glue between the real economy, the blockchain economy, and the Binance ecosystem,"" Chino said. ""When you do something stably, price fluctuations become noise.""  Stablecoins are pegged to the value of traditional assets, usually fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar, and therefore are designed to be free of the price swings that often afflict cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC).  Rival crypto exchanges Coinbase (COIN) and Kraken have both withdrawn from the Japanese market in the last six months, citing ""market conditions"" as the reason.  Chino said crypto winter may be hampering the traditional model of a crypto exchange business, given how lower valuations and trading volume will diminish revenue from fees. He said that Binance's vision for ""freedom of money"" through crypto and blockchain technology supersedes the exchange business model and the present market conditions.  ""The ecosystem has many facets,"" he said. ""For example, we will provide various services from a different angle to finance, and we will also provide various IP (intellectual property) contents in the form of Web3.""  Binance's move back into Japan this summer will come two years after the exchange received warning from the country's Financial Services Agency (FSA) that it was operating there without permission.  Chino described how one of the keys to gain regulatory acceptance in Japan is ensuring understanding of how its products work in order to gain trust, something he admits may be a challenge.  ""We are confident about our product and technology, but we are still a long way off in terms of whether the company Binance and its activities are properly understood,"" he said.

12934416,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=535112,1685104149,Altcoins Across The Sector Are Underbought: Santiment,"On-chain data from Santiment suggests that altcoins across the entire cryptocurrency sector may be underbought right now. MVRV Of The Various Altcoins Suggests Underpriced Conditions According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, cryptocurrency assets have become underbought as traders are now capitulating following a failed price rebound. The relevant indicator here is the “MVRV” (Market Value to Realized Value), which measures the ratio between the market cap and the realized cap of a given cryptocurrency. Here, the “realized cap” refers to a capitalization model for BTC where the value of any coin in the circulating supply is assumed to be not the current spot price, but the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. This model aims to calculate a sort of “fair value” for the asset. As the MVRV compares the market cap (that is, the current price) with the real value of the cryptocurrency, it can provide hints about whether the price is currently overinflated or not. Santiment has defined an “opportunity” zone and a “danger” zone for this indicator. As their names already imply, the asset in question becomes underpriced when the metric is in the former area, while it becomes overpriced in the latter one. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: NUPL Finds Rejection At Long-Term Resistance Here is a chart that shows the trend in the divergence of the MVRV from these zones for the various altcoins in the sector: The value of the metric seems to be above zero for most of the market | Source: Santiment on Twitter Whenever the MVRV divergence has a value of 1 or more, the indicator is said to be inside the opportunity zone. Similarly, the danger area occurs below a value of -1. While these are the two extreme zones, the metric being firmly inside either the positive or the negative zone (but not hitting either of these thresholds), still signals slight underbought or overpriced conditions, respectively. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hangs At $26,200: Why This Is A Crucial Support Level This means that the chances of bullish rebounds can become greater whenever the indicator enters positive territory. From the chart, it’s visible that the vast majority of the coins in the digital asset sector are at least inside the positive territory at the moment. This would imply that these coins may have become underpriced recently. Some of the altcoins are also outright inside the opportunity zone, suggesting that they may be offering low-risk buying opportunities right now. There are a few cryptocurrencies, however, that are inside the negative zone, with a couple of them even being inside dangerous territory. Such alts have more chances of registering a decline in the near future. Recently, the various altcoins have attempted to amass together a rebound, but so far, they have only seen failure. However, now that the prices have started to become undervalued, perhaps a break may be found soon. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $26,400, down 1% in the last week.

42410586,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdfcTd,1685102407,First Mover Americas: Digital Currency Group Is Closing Down TradeBlock,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Digital Currency Group (DCG), the parent company of CoinDesk is closing down its trade execution and prime brokerage services unit, TradeBlock, citing crypto winter and regulatory uncertainties. The shutdown of the unit, which provides trading services to institutional investors, will be effective as of May 31, a DCG spokesperson told CoinDesk. TradeBlock was acquired in 2020 by CoinDesk, and was later spun out as its own standalone business. CoinDesk kept the index data operating from the deal, which was rebranded as CoinDesk Indices, and ""has proven to be a successful acquisition,"" the spokesperson said. The story was first reported by Bloomberg.  The number of ether (ETH) on exchanges has hit a low not seen since July 2016 as staking saps up available tokens. Data from Glassnode shows that as of Thursday, 14.85% of all ether was held in wallets owned by centralized exchanges. That’s the smallest proportion since ether was in its infancy during the summer of 2016. In contrast, during the bull market of 2021, the exchange balance was around 25%. Low exchange balances are typically thought to be a bullish sign as it means the supply of ether available for purchase is limited.  U.S. Bitcoin Corp. (USBTC) is set to become one of the largest miners in America following a deal to buy mining assets from bankrupt lender Celsius. The company is part of the Farenheit consortium that won a bankruptcy auction for the Celsius assets, which include a lending portfolio, cryptocurrencies and 121,800 mining machines. Once it brings all the mining rigs online, its fleet will total at least 270,000 mining rigs and computing power of 12.2.exahash/second (EH/s), the firm told CoinDesk, putting U.S. Bitcoin Corp. alongside other U.S. mining giants likes Riot Platforms (RIOT), Core Scientific (CORZ) and Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA).

Bitcoin Ordinals have similarities to NFTs but with a key differentiator. The Ordinals scene is exploding. This week in the space of four days the number of Ordinals in existence has risen from eight million to nine million. It’s very early in the cycle and Ordinals represent a huge financial opportunity for those smart enough and quick off the mark. FOMO kills but it kills at the end of the cycle not at the beginning. To make the 'big' money you have to be early and you most certainly have to be brave. Brave is not the same as foolhardy, but the emotions you feel can be the same. For me, you look for the very early opportunity and if you think it's good you leave it alone. If you know it's great, you grab some. I repeat this saying over and over because it works: 'If you think it's gold it isn't, if you know it's gold it is.' I learnt this up to my thighs in a freezing cold river panning for nuggets. There you definitely want to believe the glint in your pan is gold not mica, but when you get a speck of the real thing, you know it's gold. Just like the saying goes, when you think it's gold, it is always mica; a glinting false positive. So, there is a new craze in Bitcoin, and I think it is gold. It is Ordinals . An Ordinal is a piece of information written onto the Bitcoin blockchain and referenced by a unique address also held in the blockchain data structure. It's like an NFT, but somewhat different and that difference is important. An NFT is a crypto token that references a piece of data somewhere else on the internet like the IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), which holds the actual data connected to the token. The data might be somewhere else so the trouble is, if that file or its storage goes away the NFT data is gone leaving the token pointing to thin air. It's like holding a Super Bowl ticket for last year's game. This means Ethereum could be doing its thing in a hundred years, but the Bored Monkeys or Punks may have long since evaporated in a cloud of bit-decay with the stored images no longer where their NFT references (of course someone might bodge a fix for this, but you see that this is different from holding the monkey inside of the blockchain itself). An Ordinal is actually stored in a Bitcoin block so while Bitcoin or any of its consequential forks live, the data is there. The only way for it to vanish is for Bitcoin to stop existing and for every instance of the blockchain to be erased. That is almost impossible. If there was a zombie apocalypse replete with survivalists you can bet someone, somewhere would be running Bitcoin on solar. An Ordinal, like the cockroaches, would be amongst the last things to go extinct. All sorts of things are being stored as Ordinals, which can be up to a limit of 4 megabytes of information in size. However, storage is not cheap as it must be mined into the blockchain rather than dangled off a remote server somewhere. I used ordinalsbot.com and paid to 'inscribe' a 25K byte image onto the Bitcoin blockchain; it cost $115. Megabytes would cost thousands. The attraction is the fact the Ordinal of the art piece I created will never disappear; like a neolithic cave painting in Lascaux or Native American glyphs this work is forever. While it didn't take many years for 5% of van Gogh's paintings to go missing, my piece is guaranteed to be nigh on immortal. If you want to take a look it's Ordinal 8041535 and for 1 BTC it's yours (I can't resist a side hustle). When I visited the Miami Blockchain show on the 19th there were eight million Ordinals in existence and four days later there were nine million. The creation of Ordinals is exploding. As such, it is a land grab moment and anyone wanting to try and capture that initial opportunity should get their skates on now. Meanwhile this development is, or maybe isn't, great news for Bitcoin. It has certainly exploded transaction fees. Here is a chart. Bitcoin transactions (bitinfocharts.com) Quite a few 'Bitcoin maxis' aren't a fan. Bitcoin is their digital gold; Bitcoin is for serious economic purposes not frog pictures. It's like taking gold and making earrings out of it….oh wait! To the Bitcoin hardcore, Ordinals are not part of Satoshi's vision. It is a clever 'hack' to create new but unwanted functionality. Sadly - for them - it can't be stopped as Ordinals use legitimate Bitcoin structures and functionalities to do their 'inscription' thing. However, the Bitcoin maxis' concern is real. If there is huge value in storing things like pictures and text in the Bitcoin blockchain it will drive up the cost and muscle out financial transactions, and that seems like a threat. Alternatively, it will drive low value transactions off Bitcoin altogether and onto Layer 2 solutions in the same way Polygon serves a similar purpose for Ethereum. Long gone are the dreams of Bitcoin being cheaper than TradFi, and it will never be the case that sending money normally within your country via an old school bank will cost dollars a pop. Then again, Ordinals may be a fad doomed to die out. It could happen, like the death of so many crazes. However, I believe that is not going to happen because even the silliest crypto stuff takes on a life of its own and refuses to die. That's not just a crypto thing. Take, for example, obsolete timekeepers. They sell for tens of thousands and right now are all the rage; the same is still true for postage stamps. Mad economics is not simply reserved for blockchain economics. More likely Ordinals will spark a new wave of activity for Bitcoin where new use cases appear that go beyond its previous incarnation. All the while, it will remain the Layer 0 of all crypto. The fact transaction levels have shot up and driven a bonus for miners, many of whom were struggling until a sudden flow of Ordinal fees came pouring in, should be enough to prove that Ordinals are a breakthrough not a bane. Everyone at the Miami Bitcoin show was using the cliché 'down the rabbit hole.' Ordinals are another 'rabbit hole' to fall down, and one I expect to be extremely profitable. I believe they are going to be a huge financial opportunity for the early, and no doubt once again a trap for the late FOMO crowd.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | FIAT | ICO,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4607586-bitcoin-ordinals-are-the-latest-web3-craze?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/12953867.jpeg

The project has a unique set of technologies that allow it to run better and faster than competing Layer 1s. A fundamental approach shows a blockchain that’s better rated compared to Layer 1 peers. FTX's sudden failure was a shock to the whole Solana ecosystem. New innovative technologies such as Compression, Validator Client Software and the Neon EVM are attracting projects involved in decentralized infrastructure and NFTs. Solana recently released a blockchain-native smartphone with an embedded wallet. Thesis Though Solana (SOL-USD) is named after a beach, life at SOL has been ANYTHING but a beach. Like all projects, Solana suffered from the 5/2022 TerraUSD stablecoin crash and the associated decline in the Terra (LUNA-USD) ecosystem. However, the hit to Solana during the 11/2022 FTX (FTT-USD) blowup was considerably worse than its peers. Below I highlight the numerous ways Solana was uniquely affected by the FTX event and then show how the Solana ecosystem has pivoted away from Defi towards NFTs and the consumer market. This pivot is being aided by Solana's innovate technologies, several of which will go live in 2024. Before proceeding, I give a summary of my Ratings Scorecard for Solana as I see a dire need for a holistic fundamental analysis that's currently not being utilized. Anatoly Yakovenko and the Birth of Solana The soul of Solana is Anatoly ""Toly"" Yakovenko, who co-created the project while working at Qualcomm. Toly was trading on the side and figured there could be a better way of trading quicker and on a level playing field with professionals. So in 2017, Toly organized a group of Qualcomm colleagues and friends to find a better solution ( Whitepaper ). Solana is a monolithic, Beta-staged, non-EVM designed L1, third-generation, smart-contract protocol developed to enhance network scalability and performance through its novel Proof-of-History (PoH) technology. Yes, that's a mouthful! Technologies Below I highlight the key technologies that will power the project into 2024 and help mitigate regulatory risks. Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of History (PoH): Solana uses a PoS consensus mechanism (like most L1 chains) that is optimized with an innovation called PoH. Solana's PoH boosts TPS to 50k with Max Theoretical TPS (Transactions per Second) of >100k. This is becoming increasingly important now as NFTs and Meme coins have slowed the Ethereum and Bitcoin networks and users are seeking an alternative chain. Pontem Network Validators: Solana has amongst the highest number of validators. It has made continued and successful efforts to increase its Nakamoto coefficient (number of validators that would need to collude to control the network) and geographic and cloud diversity. Solana is now focusing on node quality, not just quantity (see Validator Client below). This is important as U.S. regulators are less likely to label Solana as a security if they consider it ""sufficiently decentralized."" Solana has a staking ratio of 71% ( See Tables below for historical data). Solana Foundation Messari Validator Client : In 2024, Jump Crypto's Firedancer client software will be introduced, which will allow better concurrent transaction processing and will significantly improve performance, decentralization and reliability (i.e., reducing all those outages!). Solana's monolithic design, which handles both transaction execution and consensus on the same chain will also support its security going forward. Not Ethereum Virtual Machine ((EVM)) compatible : It's difficult to port over Dapps from the Ethereum chain to Solana's. However, on 12/2022, Neon EVM went live on Solana's mainnet with full EVM compatibility and interoperability expected by 2Q'2023. Going forward, this will help deter the migration of dapps from Ethereum to EVM compatible chains like Fantom (and onto Solana instead). Ratings Scorecard I developed a scoring system that broadly rates blockchain projects. Solana is amongst the highest-rated project - factors are summarized below: Funding: Above-Average . Rating was lowered from excellent due to the FTX scandal. Solana had over $0.5Bn in funding during 2018 and was the third-largest post-ICO funded project. During the aftermath of FTX, Toly said the project still has ""30 months of funding."" There's an ongoing $600MM in seed funding related to Solana's hackathons. Management team: Excellent . Several experienced team members and good relationships with other projects. Formerly worked at Qualcomm, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Dropbox. Technology: Above-average. On 2/22, Solana's Wormhole bridge was hacked for $321MM. Despite several outages in 2022 (only one so far in 2023), TPS speed is high and there's near-instant finality ( See Technologies for additional information ). Developers: Excellent . Most rapid developer growth amongst large cap blockchains. Its programming language Rust is considered the "" most beloved language "" by coders. Electric Capital User Experience (U/X): Above-Average . The Solana wallet, Phantom , is typically highly recommended and the nice U/X make it appealing to onboard users. Introduced a blockchain-enabled smartphone. Use-Case: Average : Huge decline in Total Value Locked (TVL) in 2022 and weak Defi activity. However, very popular for DePIN (decentralized infrastructure) ( see below ). Decentralization: Above-Average : Validators, Nakomoto Coefficient, and diversity (by Data-Center ASN, country) has increased over time (see charts below). Both Solana and Liquid Staking Pools (i.e., LIDO) are pushing to onboard validators outside of the ""superminority"" of validators that comprise the Nakomoto Coefficent. Solana Foundation Solana Foundation Tokenomics: Average : There's no Maximum Supply. Inflation , at 9%, is scheduled to decline rapidly to 1.5% in about nine years. Inflation may be lower due to 50% of transaction fees that are burned. High percentage of Insiders ( 48% Founders/Investors and 60% including Solana Foundation) is a negative in terms of potential dumping by Whales. Vesting schedule is now complete (no token unlocks). Alameda Research is expected to sell its coin-stash when the bankruptcy restructuring is complete. InvestAnswers Social: Excellent . High social engagement. Nearly 2.3 million Twitter followers, 59k Telegram followers and 1.8 million CoinMarketCap watchlists. The Death of Solana Solana's name comes from the beach near Qualcomm's headquarters. However, life for Solana has been ANYTHING but a beach. The FTX (and Alameda hedge fund co-founded by Sam Bankman-Fried ((SBF))) failure left Solana for dead. Below I summarize the effects from the FTX fraud: The number of Validators temporarily declined, suggesting FTX/Alameda were running the lost ones. The 45MM SOL tokens owned by Alameda/FTX will likely be sold when the bankruptcy reorganization is completed (source: Solana Compass ). Solana's popular decentralized exchange (DEX) Dapp called Serum had to be forked into a new DEX - Openbook. Serum was decentralized in name-only as SBF controlled most of its coins and admin-keys. Its TVL (Total Value Locked) plummeted ( see chart ). TVL had already been declining before FTX's scandal. The decline was attributed to lower volumes post the Terra-Luna failure as well as a clock problem . Solana's Developers were rumored to quit en masse . This was later found to be a data-issue from the data provider Token Terminal. ( See chart for Code Commits decline .) The Treasury (i.e., funding) level was rumored to have dwindled. This is partially true as Solana had $200MM of FTT (FTX) and SRM (Serum) tokens, which together are now worth around $10MM (as of 5/2023). Several Dapps, such as Oxygen (a prime brokerage) and Maps.me (mapping app), on the Solana network said (on Twitter ) that they were custodied (i.e., controlled) by FTX. Solana lost two of its largest NFT dapps (DeGods, y00ts) which migrated to Ethereum and Polygon. DeFiLlamma Tokeninsight The Rebirth of Solana It's ironic that the loss of the NFT Dapps was the ""final straw"" that broke Solana's back, because Solana's NFT technologies have been key to its rebirth. To me, Solana's DNA always felt that it was about connecting consumers rather than the business of finance. Toly himself is a ""social connector"" who worked at Qualcomm - a company which links people and data. As FTX was collapsing, Solana began making deals with consumer-facing Facebook/Instagram ( for NFTs ), Google Cloud (its Blockchain Node Engine will allow anyone to setup a Solana node), and Fireblocks (launched support for Solana NFTs and games). And let's not forget the dog-meme coin named BONK , which was air-dropped into Solana on 1/2023. Even non-tech companies like McDonald's have tested Happy Meal NFTs and ASICs introduced a new running shoe (X Solana UI Collection) which will give owners the chance to win a STEPN-based NFT . Given this momentum, Solana's NFT volume-growth is greater than Defi, according to analysis by CryptoPotato . Messari Onboarding the Next Billion Users There's a saying that Web3 needs a ""killer app"" to onboard the next one billion users. In Solana's case, I believe its ""killer app"" isn't an app at all! While Solana's ecosystem remains mid-sized, I believe its ethos of innovation, as well as the technologies I noted above, will carry the chain to the next level. Two recent innovations are Compressed NFTs and the Solana smartphone. Compressed NFTs (co-developed by Metaplex ) are NFTs on Solana that store their data in a Merkle tree (think of a digital fingerprint) structure where the Merkle root is on-chain in an account and the Merkle leaves are stored in the Solana ledger (which is off-chain) rather than fully on-chain like conventional NFTs. So who cares? Well, this method allows costs to fall by magnitudes of scale, opening new use-cases for NFTs ( see chart ). The use-cases are ginormous, including gaming, events, music ticketing (think Ticketmaster) metaverse, enterprise supply chains and personal identity/records. Solana Foundation Render and Helium moving to Solana On 4/2023, Helium moved from its native blockchain to Solana. Solana's technology is aptly suited for what's called ""DePIN"" - (decentralized physical infrastructure networks) such as wireless, storage and energy networks. Helium provides peer-to-peer Hotspots that creates an internet of things ((IOT)) and a mobile network. The project said its move was motivated by Solana's reliability, access to developers, Solana's network speed and most importantly, compression technology that will sharply lower Helium's network costs. Also on 4/2023, Render Network , the first decentralized graphics processing unit ((GPU)) rendering network ( Beeple uses them ), voted to migrate from the Ethereum/Polygon platforms to Solana. Render also announced a partnership with Metaplex, so Render will be able to sharply lower costs for its graphically-intense (and real-time) renderings and utilize Solana's scalability and software developers. The Saga Phone On 5/8/23, Solana announced that consumers will be able to order its new Solana Saga smartphone. Odds are, the Saga won't be able to compete successfully against the iPhone/Android incumbents. However, a great deal will be learned. Saga features a Mobile Stack that integrates crypto usefulness (think payments) into the phone's hardware and software. For example, there's what's called a Seed-Vault, which stores a user's private keys in a segregated manner from the rest of the phone's data, thereby offering heightened protection to the keys. Toly jokes that it'll have 16 dapps (around the same number Apple had on its first smartphone) in its appropriately name Dapp Store. Solana will undercut Android's/Apple's 30% fee as it will not charge ANY fee. I believe that even if the Saga gains a fraction of the smartphone TAM ($479Bn in 2023 ), it'll be deemed a success given the large market opportunity. Already, orders have been steadily climbing to 10,000. (See Chart.) Adheeraj (Dune Analytics) Determining a Valuation Method Changes in TVL have been behind strong moves in coin prices, especially when users are dependent on just one third-party data provider - in this case Defi Llama. For example, some TVLs soar from nothing to hundreds of millions due to incentive programs. However, those incentives tend to burn-out quickly - and how do you compare incentive vs. non-incentive (Solana) projects on an apples-to-apples basis ? In the case of Solana, not all of its ecosystem's TVL is captured - some of this is due to the high composability of Solana. For example, the Hivemapper, Helium and Render dapps are not in Defi Llama's dropdown data for Solana. This is especially true when the project has a high proportion of NFT transactions that are participating in Defi. Kamino Finance wrote an article highlighting this very point. There are several ways you can value crypto projects including: number of active addresses, daily transactions, price/book, price/revenue and price/TVL. However, I believe it's too early to use these metrics as crypto projects are analogous to venture capital portfolio companies which have minimal revenue-bases. As I mentioned with TVL, several of the metrics can be incorrect. Prior to FTX, I thought Solana was somewhat undervalued using price to book value. I assumed that its huge treasury was analogous to book value as projects are debt-free. But with the FTX blowup, so too has Solana's treasury. Given Solana's high exposure to NFTs, I believe using Market Cap/Daily Transactions (the lower the number the better) could be the best valuation strategy ( see Chart below ). Using Market Cap/Active Addresses yields similar results, with Solana being one of the most undervalued compared to its peers, at under $20,000/address. The closest peer is Near Protocol which is double that amount. InvestAnswers Technical Analysis of SOL's Chart I believe the cryptocurrency space is inefficient (asset prices do not accurately reflect fundamentals). Once you've done the hard work of finding a good project, technical analysis can be used as a timing tool. I believe that Bitcoin is overbought and that the global macro situation of tightening liquidity does not support higher prices for all crypto including Solana. Further, increased regulatory scrutiny of Altcoins and Stablecoins may increase Bitcoin's Dominance (i.e., market share of Bitcoin vs the total crypto market) causing Altcoins to ""bleed"" against Bitcoin. See Sol/Bitcoin Chart. Trading View Risks Investing in Solana: Regulatory: The SEC under Gary Gensler has conducted what I would call ""regulation by enforcement."" As of 4/2023, the SEC has sued or sent Wells Notices to 13 crypto entities, according to Blockworks. Several of these pertain to tokens/coins not being registered with the SEC as Mr. Gensler considers nearly everything (including some NFTs and Stablecoins) to be securities under the Howey Test. Crypto related crime grew to $20Bn (2022) in illicit on-chain transactions (40% sanctions related). Hacking accounted for $3.8Bn stolen (mostly from bridge-hacks including Solana's Wormhole). (Source: 2022 Crypto Crime Report (Chainanalysis ). Conclusion: Ethereum's issues with speed/scalability and long upgrade cycle, leaves the door open for new L1s like Solana to capture market share. As such, a DCA accumulation strategy would be recommended on Solana. So, if the old Facebook could ""move fast and break things"" a reborn Solana could certainly "" eat glass .""

Platinium Group has teamed up with blockchain infrastructure company Elemint and Web3 agency Bary to help create, mint and sell the NFT tickets.  According to a press release, the tickets will be minted on Ethereum sidechain Polygon. Not only will the NFTs provide access to the race, but they will continue to provide utility to holders after the event, such as hospitality benefits and future race discounts to encourage collectors to stay loyal to the brand.  Elie Zerbib, Co-Founder of Bary told CoinDesk that NFTs in the form of tickets offer buyers transparency, traceability, seamless digital ticketing, personalization and engagement. However, for a sport that has amassed fans from all over the world, easy onboarding is an essential tenet.  “By providing a completely seamless experience on the main website, the user doesn't need to have any Web3 knowledge to purchase the NFT ticket,” said Zerbib. “We make users understand the benefits that come with this new type of ticketing and onboard them on a journey that will change their F1 experience.”  Jacques-Henri Eyraud, CEO of Elemint said in a press release that leveraging blockchain technology for event ticketing will extend far beyond F1 and into the greater world of sports and entertainment.  “Web3 technologies make it possible to design ticketing solutions that are more secure and more adapted to the specificity of each event,” said Eyraud. “The experience becomes more personalized and fun for fans of all types of sports competitions.”  For the Monaco Grand Prix, certain NFT holders may be offered tickets to the most exclusive party of the event, according to Zerbib.  In the past two years, several crypto companies have flocked to Formula 1 for sponsorship deals, driven by the global brand’s ability to grant exposure to the emerging industry.

42393488,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bixaYN,1685098800,"Coinmint Sues California Chipmaker for $23M, Alleging ‘Elaborate Deception’","New York crypto miner Coinmint alleged two semiconductor companies set up an “elaborate deception” to lure the miner into a $150 million purchase agreement, in a lawsuit seeking over $23 million in damages.  Coinmint alleged that bitcoin technology firm Katena Computing and semiconductor designer company DX Corr set up a scheme to convince it to buy up to $150 million of bitcoin mining machines that Katena couldn’t and didn’t plan to deliver on, according to a lawsuit filed with a court in California’s Santa Clara County Superior Court on Jan. 26.  Read more: Crypto Chip Company Katena Wins Lawsuit Filed by Bitcoin Miner Coinmint  Under the scheme, Katena “improperly influenced, bribed or incentivized co-conspirators,” including one unnamed person within the mining firm, for a $150 million purchase of bitcoin mining machines, Coinmint alleged.  The lawsuit alleges fraud, breach of contract and fiduciary duty, as well as aiding and abetting against DX Corr and its executives as well as former Coinmint employees. Coinmint is asking for “actual, compensatory and consequential damages, including but not limited to the $23 million,” that it deposited for the sale, as well as punitive and exemplary damages.  “Katena is in binding arbitration concerning Coinmint’s breach of contract and is seeking damages caused by Coinmint’s failure to pay. Katena is eager to talk openly and factually about this dispute but will honor the arbitration process and its confidentiality requirements. When we can talk more openly, we will,” said a spokesperson for Katena.  DX Corr filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit earlier this month, saying Coinmint didn’t sufficiently bring any claims to support its allegations against the semiconductor firm.  Coinmint is no stranger to litigation. Its two cofounders fought over the firm's ownership. Coinmint filed a complaint with the New York Public Service Commission against the utility of Plattsburgh, where it operates, to avoid paying a deposit related to its electricity use. It was also involved in a tax fraud case in Puerto Rico, where it is headquartered, that was settled under a confidentiality agreement, said a source close to the matter.  Coinmint denied the existence of the alleged tax fraud case and declined to comment on this story.  Court records show the municipality of San Juan sued Coinmint in March 2022, and a judge known for their tax expertise was assigned to the case. The court did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for the complaint at the time of publication.  DX Corr did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment.  Back in 2021, an unnamed Coinmint employee initiated conversations over the purchase of equipment. “Katena engaged in an elaborate deception” to get Coinmint’s founder and CEO Ashton Soniat on board with [claims] that it ‘truly possessed a revolutionary chip design that would disrupt the Bitcoin mining world,’” the lawsuit said.  The unnamed individual was the Coinmint chief financial officer at the time. According to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and a LinkedIn, a person named Michael Maloney was Coinmint’s CFO at the time. Maloney declined CoinDesk’s request for comment through LinkedIn.  Katena was dangling an offer for the position of CFO and equity as part of the plot to Maloney, said the lawsuit.  The then-CFO asked Katena to recommend a semiconductor expert to perform due diligence on the machines. But Katena suggested Robert Bleck as an independent observer, even though he was in fact in collusion with DX Corr executive and Katena minority shareholder Sagar Reddy, Coinmint alleged. Bleck was Reddy’s “b***h,” the lawsuit read.  Bleck misrepresented Katena’s semiconductor design and production capabilities to the Coinmint CFO, who then tried to convince CEO Soniat.  Soniat signed a sales contract in May 2021 which “obliged Coinmint to pay Katena $150 million for miners without security or customary protection” according to Katena.  Katena also used the contract to try to get funding from investors, including investment bank JP Morgan, said the lawsuit.

The EU agency said it's worried that firms may use a seal of regulatory approval they have to offer traditional finance (TradFi) stocks or funds to make customers believe they’ll have access to sound financial advice or compensation schemes in the event of crypto mishaps.  EU rules known as the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) ensure investment intermediaries promote only appropriate financial products to clients – but don’t always apply to more exotic investment opportunities like gold, real estate or non-transferable loans.  The EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA) is set to bring MiFID-style rules to the sector, but the regime will only take effect in around 18 months. In the meantime, ESMA, a Paris-based agency that groups and coordinates national regulators, is worried some companies are encouraging and exploiting the ambiguity.  “ESMA recommends that investment firms take all necessary measures to ensure that clients are fully aware of the regulatory status of the product/service they are receiving and clearly disclose to clients when regulatory protections do not apply,” ESMA said, adding that regulatory approval shouldn't be used as a promotional tool.  ESMA has previously warned people crypto can be risky, while an October paper highlighted novel threats such as hacks and consensus manipulation. The agency is also set to consult shortly on detailed secondary laws that will put MiCA into effect.

Data from Glassnode shows that as of Thursday, 14.85% of all ether was held in wallets owned by centralized exchanges. The market hasn’t seen a level this low since ether was in its infancy during the summer of 2016.  In contrast, during the bull market of 2021, the exchange balance was around 25-26%. Typically low exchange balances are a bullish sign as it means the supply of ether available for purchase is limited, thus, it puts pressure on prices to increase.  In the last few weeks, staking's growing popularity has helped soak up supply from the market.  The introduction of the Shapella upgrade to the Ethereum network has triggered a surge in ether staking, with over 4.4 million additional coins deposited since the upgrade, as large ether holders increasingly opt for generating passive income rather than liquidating their assets.  ""This trend is anticipated to persist, particularly considering that deflationary forces are expected to propel the price of Ether significantly,"" analysts at Binfinex previously shared with CoinDesk. ""Prior to this upgrade, potential stakeholders may have been deterred from staking their ether tokens due to concerns about their funds being locked for an unacceptably long duration.""  All this comes as crypto trading volumes decline by double digits.  Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, experienced a 48% decrease in spot trading volume for the second consecutive month in April, reaching $287 billion - the second-lowest since 2021 - with its market share also reducing to 46%, reflecting a broader 40% industry-wide decline due to macroeconomic uncertainties and U.S. bank collapses.

Elsewhere, an unrelated LADYS token spiked thousands of percent, reaching a market capitalization of over $120 million.  All gains have since reversed, as the NFT collection is now back at prices before Musk’s tweet, data from OpenSea analytics shows, dropping to as low as 3.2 ether per NFT on Thursday.  This is similar to the price action seen in dogecoin (DOGE) – which enjoys Musk’s support – which typically spikes whenever it is mentioned by the entrepreneur.

42393480,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bixaDr,1685084315,The Invisible Hand Restricting Bitcoin and Ether Price Swings,"Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), the top two cryptocurrencies by market value, have been unusually calm for over two weeks. The range play probably stems from the market running into competing narratives and influences.  There is another powerful force at work, a so-termed invisible hand of crypto options market makers, partly responsible for keeping prices rangebound, according to observers.  Market makers are entities with a contractual obligation to maintain a healthy level of liquidity on an exchange. They ensure there is enough depth in the order book by offering to buy or sell a call/put option contract at any given time.  For instance, if a trader wants to buy a BTC call option at the $40,000 strike price and there is no matching sell order, the market maker would do the needful by providing the sell order. Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy, while a put option offers the right to sell.  Market makers, therefore, are always on the opposite side of investors and maintain a delta-neutral (direction-neutral) book by actively buying and selling the underlying asset in the spot or futures market as the price swings.  Stuffed with ""positive gamma""  In recent weeks, investors have been shorting or writing call options or bullish bets, a popular volatility-selling strategy aimed at generating a yield on top of spot market holdings. As such, market makers have been stuffed with long call positions or positive gamma. Options gamma is the rate of change in the options price in response to changes in the underlying asset's price. When gamma is positive, options become pricier when the underlying asset's price rises or falls.  Holding large positive gamma forces market makers to trade against the direction in which the spot prices move to keep their books delta neutral. So, if bitcoin and ether drop, the options market makers, stuffed with positive gamma, must buy cryptocurrencies in the spot market. Similarly, they must take bearish bets in spot/futures markets if the market rallies. This hedging activity has been keeping prices locked in the narrow range.  ""These massive call overwriting programs have left dealers stuffed long [positive] gamma. So it becomes a negative feedback loop as the gamma hedging keeps spot ranges contained, weighing further on volatility, then dealers also try to lighten on long gamma positions,"" David Brickell, director of institutional sales at crypto liquidity network Paradigm, said.  ""In the absence of a catalyst/narrative to start taking a directional risk, that systematic, mechanical volatility selling will keep weighing,"" Brickell added.  The episode shows the growing influence of the options market on spot prices, a common feature in equities and foreign exchange markets. Crypto investors persistently bought call options during the bull market of 2021, leaving market makers with short gamma positions. That required market makers to trade in the direction of bitcoin and ether to balance their books, which resulted in exaggerated price moves.  Per Griffin Ardnern, a volatility trader from a crypto asset management firm, the positive gamma in ether has hit a record high and the sticky effect of market makers' hedging activity could weaken following the monthly options expiry. Deribit, the world's largest crypto options exchange that controls nearly 90% of the market, will settle May expiry options on Friday at 08:00 UTC.  ""In the case of positive gamma, the delta hedging behavior of market makers is to sell high and buy low, which compresses the price movement range to near the strike price,"" Ardern told CoinDesk. ""After the settlement, the sticky effect of hedging on the price will significantly weaken, but there could be stronger resistance, particularly in ETH. It is necessary to be careful about the risk of ETH price going downwards.""  Per Ardern, market makers hold notable positive gamma in the higher strike price ether options expiring in following months and that would create resistance.  ""If ether's price moves [higher] and approaches these levels, the delta in the hands of market makers will increase, and they will consider selling spots or perps to hedge the delta that may exceed the limit. This selling behavior creates relatively significant resistance,"" Ardern added.  Since May 12, bitcoin has traded the narrow range of $25,800 to $27,600, while ether has consolidated between $1,750 and $1,850. At press time, bitcoin and ether changed hands at $26,350 and $1,800, respectively, per CoinDesk data.  08:00 UTC: Adds Blofin's tweet and comments from Blofin's Griffin Ardern.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/26/the-invisible-hand-restricting-bitcoin-and-ether-price-swings,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bfa8701c1f73a28f9763448b86b8d489104ed578-1280x896.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

(USBTC) is looking to be one of the largest miners in the U.S. by increasing its computing power by 12.2 exahash/second (EH/s), following a deal to buy mining assets from bankrupt lender Celsius, according to a press release.  The miner is part of a consortium, named Fahrenheit, that won a bankruptcy auction for the Celsius assets, which include a lending portfolio, crypto assets and 121,800 mining machines. Once it brings all the mining rigs online, its fleet will total at least 270,000 mining rigs, the miner told CoinDesk. This will raise its computing power to the ranks of mining giants such as Riot Platforms (RIOT), Core Scientific (CORZ) and Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA).  Read more: Fahrenheit Wins Bid to Acquire Assets of Insolvent Crypto Lender Celsius  Under the Celsius deal, USBTC will enter into one or more operating and services agreements to be the ""exclusive operator"" of the Celsius mining fleet, the miner said. On top of that, USBTC will receive a $15 million annual management fee for the mining assets, net of operating expenses, for the five years it will manage the rigs, the firm added. That's $75 million on top of expenses, provided that USBTC fulfills certain operational requirements.  Another $20 million in management fees will go to the Fahrenheit consortium, court filings show. The consortium will also receive stock incentives in the new company that will house the Celsius assets. USBTC also has to build a 100 megawatts (MW) of infrastructure to house the Celsius rigs, and provide a plan for the buildout of another 240 MW of capacity in a behind-the-meter site.  The Miami-based firm has managed to massively increase its operational capabilities in the past few months, taking advantage of opportunities born out of bankruptcies. It started from a single site in Niagara Falls, New York, but has now taken control of three sites formerly operated by Compute North, which filed for Chapter 11 in September 2022. Two of those are owned by energy investment firm Generate Capital, while the third is a joint venture between USBTC and energy firm NextEra Energy.  USBTC has managed to secure hosting deals for 150,000 machines in its facilities. It is also undergoing a merger with Canada's Hut 8 Mining (HUT).  Other members of the consortium that will be managing the Celsius assets are Arrington Capital, Proof Group Capital Management, Steven Kokinos, and Ravi Kaza.
