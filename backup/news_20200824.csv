The hacker broke into a CryptoTrader.Tax marketing and customer service employee’s account on a support center platform, according to a source who came across the hacker on a dark web forum. With this access, the hacker could see customers’ names, email addresses, payment processor profiles and messages sometimes containing cryptocurrency incomes.      The hacker then screengrabbed samples of this sensitive information, posted them on the forum to entice potential buyers of the data trove and sent additional pictures to the source, who shared this evidence with CoinDesk.      See also: Even the IRS Admits Some Crypto Tax Regulations Are ‘Not Ideal’      David Kemmerer, a co-founder and the chief executive of CryptoTrader.Tax, confirmed to CoinDesk that a hacker gained unauthorized access on April 7 to the marketing and customer service employee’s account. The hacker was able to see support center details in the materials and downloaded a file containing 13,000 rows of information, including 1,082 unique email addresses, Kemmerer said.      CryptoTrader.Tax’s security team investigated the breach and found tax filing account passwords and CryptoTrader.Tax’s website were not compromised, Kemmerer said.

42384521,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAXgtL,1598300641,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Hits $11.8K; Ethereum Gas at All-Time High,"The bitcoin market is experiencing low volume Monday but ether continues to fuel DeFi’s growth.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $11,737 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 0.34% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $11,592-$11,823.  BTC above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Read More: Leveraged Funds Take Record Bearish Positions in Bitcoin Futures      Bitcoin’s price opened the week heading higher, hitting $11,823 on Monday before dipping lower. ""Bitcoin has settled into a consolidation position at $11,700,” said Daniel Koehler, liquidity manager at cryptocurrency exchanges OKCoin. “It appears that traders are waiting for better fills at $11,000,” he added.      Darius Sit, managing partner of quantitative trading firm QCP Capital, expects the final full week of August to be quieter than earlier in the month, when the world’s oldest cryptocurrency hit a 2020 high of $12,485 on spot exchanges like Coinbase.      Read More: Bitcoin Surges Past $12,000 to New 2020 High      “One thing we were looking at is that August tends to be a weak month for both BTC and ETH,” said Sit. “So if that seasonality plays out, this last week of August might see some weakness.”      Spot volumes on major BTC/USD exchanges Monday are low. For Luxembourg-based Bitstamp, for example, it was just $27 million, well below its $91 million daily average.      Interestingly, there are more addresses now with 1,000 or more bitcoin than ever before. The count of those on the “Bitcoin Rich List” has reached a high of 2,190. Those addresses hold nearly 7.87 million BTC, the equivalent of $92.2 billion.      Nonetheless, many stakeholders who are usually bullish are expecting some retrenchment from bitcoin’s price gains, including Rupert Douglas, head of institutional trading for digital asset broker Koine. “We've come a long way quickly. I wouldn't be surprised by a pause or a pullback,” Douglas said. OKcoin’s Koehler echoed that sentiment. “Momentum is still signaling bullish, but it’s unclear if we should test the $10,000 breakout area before moving higher,” said.      Douglas also noted ether (ETH) continues to steal bitcoin’s spotlight. “Overall, ETH is stronger and I think will continue to outperform BTC,” he said.      Read More: Marathon Brings New Bitcoin Mining Rigs Online    Into the ether    Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Monday, trading around $401 and climbing 2.1% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

A unit of measure to execute operations on the network, gas is used within Ethereum to conduct transactions or use smart contracts. The record amount of gas used is viewed as a sign that Ethereum’s utility for decentralized finance, or DeFi, is higher than ever.      However, George Clayton, managing partner of Cryptanalysis CapitaI, has concerns whether Ethereum’s heavy usage can be sustained given that average fees for using the network have gone as high as $6.68 in August. “I think the gas issue is leaving Ethereum vulnerable,” he said, “vulnerable to competing smart contract public blockchains.

42384500,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAXgVR,1598293577,DeFi Is Just Like the ICO Boom and Regulators Are Circling,"Donna Redel is the former chairman of COMEX, a board member of New York Angels and an Adjunct Professor of Law at Fordham Law School. Olta Andoni is an Adjunct Professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law and Of Counsel at Zlatkin Wong, LLP.      A corner of the crypto universe representing less than 1% of total market capitalization of crypto assets has been grabbing the headlines since June. This is the world of decentralized finance, or DeFi, which alternatively is referred to as the center of innovation, an experiment or the new wild, wild west where projects move fast and break things.      A recent glance of articles on CoinDesk demonstrates the phenomenon. Once again, crypto headlines are focusing on the “craze,” the “frenzy of yield farming,” “investors pouring money into” and “another protocol going up in a fireball.”      Will the nonstop headlines and framing around the “hot” new DeFi protocols chill the institutional adoption that is beginning in earnest for crypto, digital assets and blockchain technology?      We believe that, at a minimum, the industry needs self-regulation. Without it, it is on a trajectory to serious regulatory scrutiny and reputational risk.      We are not the only ones to express concern about DeFi. Vitalik Buterin tweeted Aug. 14:      Also, Robert Leshner, the founder of Compound, a leading DeFi project, said of the yield farming craze recently:      As with almost everything in crypto, the strong sentiments and opinions make it difficult to determine the true essence and reality around the majority of DeFi projects. For us, this refrain is reminiscent of 2017’s frothy initial coin offering (ICO) days that ended badly for the good names of blockchain and crypto.      There are certainly similarities: trading frenzy; projects emerging with little or no testing and without audit; no clear regulatory guidance and the recycling of ETH now leading to inflated gas prices. Are we on the precipice of one of the regulatory agencies waking up and sending a missive similar to The Dao Report?      On the legal front, there is a lack of clear consensus about which agency should be regulating. And, again, there is a lack of guidance from multiple agencies that could be responsible for DeFi projects or for the space generally.      We are alarmed and concerned with the apparent lack of 360-degree understanding of the potential role of the various actors or operators and their possible interactions with the projects, the governance and hence DeFi ecosystem. Tokens are appearing overnight. Projects are hesitant to use, or totally avoid, terminology that might infer “issue,” “issuance” or “issuer,” as these are hypersensitive words in the securities world.      See also: What Is Yield Farming? The Rocket Fuel of DeFi, Explained      Calling a project an “experimental game” or an “innovation” is not sufficient to take it out of the regulatory ambit. The focus is shifting from securities regulation of “the issuer” and the Howey Test prevalent during the ICO days and after, to more complex analysis of the application of commodities regulation, questions relating to who is the “controlling stakeholder(s)” and whether liability or responsibility falls on them.      Many questions, from a perspective of both securities law and commodities laws, should be examined anew to see how they may be applied to, as well as reimagined for, a disintermediated-decentralized financial model.      The outstanding questions include whether the “controlling stakeholders” are determined by voting control on DeFi platforms, who among the investor group and founders who has voting control, and whether there should be standards for exchange listing.      Furthermore, it remains to be seen whether defining these projects as “decentralized” puts them outside of the regulatory reach or whether the “centralized” ones should be referred to as “disintermediated finance” – aka the ability to conduct secure financial transactions directly, without the use of financial intermediaries.    Calling a project an 'experimental game' or an 'innovation' is not sufficient to take it out of the regulatory ambit.    Despite the regulatory uncertainty, traders, projects and exchanges are going full steam ahead, with the result that tokens run high risks of unwarranted price changes, which impacts governance, liquidity and the well-being of the projects.      The mid-March meltdown of Maker was a warning to all about systemic risk and leverage. DeFi’s leverage and exposure to ETH has resulted in price escalation that compromised the governance voting for the projects, thereby necessitating a revamp of governance procedures. Some are optimistic about ETH’s rising price but are higher gas fees and network congestion compatible with DeFi’s long term goal of the democratization of finance?      In our view, the DeFi experiment demonstrates the need for creating a new set of industry rules: audits, proper risk disclosures and planning to anticipate what could go wrong before it actually happens. DeFi self-regulation should normalize collateral sufficiency reviews, auditing standards, governance both on an ongoing and crisis basis as well as the distribution-centralized ownership of tokens.      A DeFi sandbox organized with the appropriate regulators would be a pathway to validation without excessive volatility or velocity of assets locked up principally due to “yield farming.” Experiments should grow at a measured pace which is the sandbox approach, where “experimental” projects would be launched and the community’s participation would be monitored.      See also: Redel/Andoni - A Safer Harbor: Improving Hester Peirce’s Proposal for Regulating Token Sales      An example of DeFi chaos is YAM, a project with an unaudited code, claiming to be a stablecoin, which made headlines for its rapid boom and bust all within 48 hours. With respect to stablecoins, we should remember regulators are still considering their status. Valerie Szczepanik, the Securities and Exchance Commission (SEC) senior adviser for digital assets, has said that certain types of stablecoins “...could raise issues under securities laws.”      Additionally, the IOSCO (International Organizations of Securities Commissions) report indicated stablecoins could be securities. We need both specificity on a national and global level including from the G20.      Governance is central to many DeFi projects and definitely a component of regular finance that is looking for reformation. Unfortunately, crisis governance has become too frequent in DeFi. Many of these projects rely on governance protocols where a very small group of participants are able and/or pressured to change the protocol.      It remains to be seen how a regulatory loophole in which these tokens are created, distributed and traded all without regulatory supervision will play out. At least with a modified Safe Harbor, proposed by Commissioner Hester Peirce, and which we commented on earlier this year, the SEC would have some oversight. For the moment, tokens in the DeFi are appearing daily and the explosion of tokens is leading to a distortion of purpose and “investors” are getting burned as projects implode.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | REGULATION | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,"Donna Redel, Olta Andoni",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/08/24/defi-is-just-like-the-ico-boom-and-regulators-are-circling,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6e81047d99937a9f5071a5cafc55bb042310b684-1300x731.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to Cryptoslate, the streak suggests “$10,000 as strong support, which typically is a positive medium-term sign.”      Bearish bets Bearish bets in bitcoin futures from leveraged funds hit record highs on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole said. Last week, leveraged funds increased their short positions by 110% to a record high of 14,100 contracts, according to a Commitment of Traders (COT) report published by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Friday. Crypto derivatives research firm Skew suggests these short positions are “a function of attractive cash and carry levels,” an arbitrage strategy.    Op-ed    Crypto Long & Short It wasn’t just Coinbase alum Brian Brooks, now head of the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), who wanted to open the possibility for banks to custody crypto – the OCC had been looking at this for some time. CoinDesk Head of Research Noelle Acheson looks at the growing number of regulators and politicians – including from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Congress – trying to “support crypto innovation while protecting investors for longer than many realize.” Thus, “the OCC’s recent bold move is probably not the only welcome surprise we’ll see from an official body this year,” she writes.

42384506,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAXgaT,1598281960,Ether Volatility Now Highest in Six Months Compared With Bitcoin’s,"Investors are expecting more volatility in ether (ETH) compared with bitcoin (BTC), according to a key metric, with the measure of risk at a six-month high amid a boom in decentralized finance (DeFi).    The three-month spread between ether's volatility and bitcoin's has risen to 29%, the highest level since Feb. 23, according to data source Skew.  The metric, which tracks the difference in implied volatility for at-the-money options in both cryptocurrencies, has risen from -2.4% to 29% in two months.  Implied volatility is calculated from options prices and shows the market's opinion of the underlying asset’s potential moves. It is often considered a proxy of market risk.  'Potential big move' - but not necessarily up  The surge in the volatility spread suggests investors are pricing bigger percentage moves in ether than bitcoin over the next quarter.  “Investors are focused on DeFi and mindful of a potential big move in ETH,"" said Skew's CEO Emmanuel Goh.  Implied volatility does not tell us anything about the direction of the next big move.  As such, traders are warned against interpreting the rise in ether-bitcoin volatility spread as a bullish price signal.  Ether has witnessed greater price volatility over the past four weeks. The three-month ether-bitcoin realized volatility spread bottomed out at 5.7% on July 20 and was last seen at 19%, the highest level since June 11.  Realized or historical price volatility is a measure of daily price movements that have already happened. Implied volatility is what the market expects for the future.  Bitcoin’s price is up 64% on a year-to-date basis, while ether has gained over 200%, according to data source CoinDesk 20.  The total value locked in DeFi platforms is now closing on the $7 billion mark – up 10% on a year-to-date basis, as per data provided by defipulse.com.

In a document seen by Forbes and covered in a report Sunday, the anonymous researchers said they had analyzed a sample of 63 bitcoin transactions linked to the Ryuk malware that were worth around $5,700,000 in total.  Of these, ""over $1 million [in bitcoin] was sent from the hacking team wallets to the Binance exchange platform to cash out their ransom payments,"" they said.  Ryuk, like other ransomware variants, locks up infected computers using encryption and demands a payment (normally in crypto) to release the files.  Ryuk is said to have raked in $61 million in the two years since it was let loose on the world, Forbes said.  Looking at 13 other bitcoin addresses linked to Ryuk, the researchers also found some of the total $1,064,865 in bitcoin held there also passed through Binance.  The remainder of the bitcoin traced, some $4.7 million worth, was found to be held on non-exchange wallets – a suggestion that the malware's operators favor Binance, according to the report.  Binance has been provided the research findings, Forbes said.  The exchange said in the report it prioritizes ensuring ""the safety of our customers and the integrity of the broader crypto space,"" though spotting such illicit activity is ""not always black and white.""  Binance also analyzed the Ryuk bitcoin flows and reportedly found that 400 bitcoin went to Huobi, a Singapore-based exchange, and 140 BTC moved through a now-closed Thailand-based exchange.

The Boston Fed, as it’s more commonly known, announced earlier this month it was actively testing a digital dollar – a tokenized version of the U.S. dollar – with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Digital Currency Initiative. The collaboration builds on previous research efforts, and is intended to establish how a digital dollar might complement the existing greenback, said Boston Fed Senior Vice President Jim Cunha. Ultimately, the results will be published and potentially considered for an actual digital dollar, though the latter part is still years away.      “What we’re doing now really is much more thorough, much more building a platform to see whether distributed ledger can meet the needs of a U.S.-based central bank digital currency,” he said. “Can it actually function?”      The collaboration is “in its formative stages,” he said, meaning right now the two institutions are determining what the requirements are for the project and which platforms to build on.      As the work proceeds, the researchers hope to answer questions about scalability, throughput, privacy, resiliency and resistance to cyber attacks, he said.      “I would think we're probably looking at 30 to 40 different either open source or private solutions at a very high level first, and then doing a deeper dive into a few of them, because we're in the early stages of this, and we want to make sure we have the broadest view possible,” Cunha said.    Fed x MIT    The Boston Fed announced its formal collaboration with the DCI to test a digital dollar last week. However, the relationship between the two entities and their research into digital currencies stretch back years, Cunha said.      “Now that we are going further with our research with the Digital Currency [Initiative], we decided to get a more formal relationship with them,” he told CoinDesk.      Neha Narula, director of the DCI and a research scientist, said MIT’s lab is a neutral research institution.      Researchers on the project will implement different designs, which Narula hopes will provide concrete data and options for policymakers who are considering whether to move forward with a CBDC and what tradeoffs might exist with one model or another.      Read more: Senate Banking Committee Remains Open to Idea of Digital Dollar in Tuesday’s Hearing      “We're excited about this collaboration because DCI’s goal is to answer the fundamental questions necessary to determine under what circumstances a CBDC is a good idea, and how we might deploy one should a central bank decide to do so,” she said. “Working closely with one of the largest central banks in the world is incredibly helpful in terms of getting real-time input on how to frame and answer these questions.”      For the moment, the research is exploratory and focused on the technology aspects, rather than policy.      Bob Bench, assistant vice president at the Boston Fed, told CoinDesk the U.S. might have a different view on privacy or other issues than other nations do, so the research effort has to consider what privacy measures it can take, as one example.      Even basic questions such as which programming language should be used are up in the air, he said.      “These are some of the issues we’re thinking about at the core level before we even start thinking about user interface,” he said.      Cunha said the goal is to publish joint research over the next two years, to ensure anyone else looking at CBDCs can learn from the collaboration’s work.      “We hope to create an open source code base that supports multiple trade offs and will be useful to anyone who is interested in building, testing, and deploying central bank digital currency,” Narula said.    Design needs    A number of factors will be considered during the research effort. Narula noted that a retail-focused CBDC would need low latency and high throughput, meaning it would need to be able to process a large number of transactions per second, while remaining secure.      Part of this mission means leveraging existing cryptographic and distributed ledger systems “that have been vetted in the real world,” she said.      “We don't want to take some brand-new consensus algorithm or cryptographic protocol and use it for a country's national currency,” she said.      Ensuring this digital dollar can serve un- or underbanked users is another goal, Cunha said, an initiative Narula agreed with.      It’s also important to ensure the resulting designs can be flexible, he said.    We don't want to take some brand-new consensus algorithm or cryptographic protocol and use it for a country's national currency.    Beyond the basic questions, the Boston Fed wants to know how issues like throughput and privacy might be affected if participants are required to pass know-your-customer and anti-money laundering checks, he said.      “We’re not getting granular with this. We’re not trying to design and think about product design down to the level of ‘how would someone unbanked use this?’, we’re trying to be flexible enough to allow innovation to answer some of those problems,” he said.      Read more: How a Flurry of ‘Digital Dollar’ Proposals Made It to Congress      Like Cunha, Bench emphasized that throughput is an important area of concern, saying whatever engine powers the CBDC would need to be able to support “the world’s largest currency’s transactions.”      Different central banks have different issues they may be concerned with, Narula said.      These are questions that may take years to resolve. Cunha said he does not expect to see anything come to production within the next two or three years.      “I would say I think a digital currency will launch inevitably, but then that’s a long time,” Cunha said. “These are decade-long paths, versus something that changes overnight.”    Years of work    The Boston Fed has been looking at distributed ledger technology since 2015 or 2016, Cunha said, and has published numerous papers on the subject. The group has also looked at similar central bank digital currency and payment efforts by other central banks, including the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s Project Ubin and Canada’s Project Jasper.      “Our goal really was to understand distributed ledgers, how it was unfolding,” he said.      This goal hasn’t changed. While private digital currency efforts like Libra and CBDC projects like China’s digital yuan may have created a bit more urgency to the Boston Fed and DCI’s work, there’s no mandate or timeline to launch a digital dollar by.      “It just creates more interest in the project,” Cunha said.      In other words, he does not see the new collaboration as being a competition between the U.S. and China, or the U.S. and the Libra Association.      Read more: China Aims to Be the World’s Dominant Blockchain Power – With Help From Google, Amazon and Microsoft      “I would say as the major powers start to launch, it does get the attention of people that are thinking about this broadly and at a policy perspective,” he said.      If anything, the fact that there are now multiple efforts underway to create a mainstream-accessible cryptocurrency might just indicate that distributed ledger technology “actually may have legs,” and has the potential to be incorporated into payment and monetary systems’ infrastructure in the future.      The Boston Fed intends to publish thought leadership papers and analysis of the platforms it evaluates as part of its new Project Hamilton, in an effort to provide educational materials based on the research, he said.      The name is a nod to Alexander Hamilton, but also to Margaret Hamilton, one of the founders of software engineering and a former director of the Software Engineering Division of the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, who worked on technology for part of the moon landing.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/08/24/boston-fed-is-looking-at-30-to-40-blockchain-networks-for-digital-dollar-experiments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/56eb8348b769ece7d848757866ae38e2c61889f8-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ever since India’s Supreme Court overturned banking restrictions in March, demand for crypto has skyrocketed.      “With the second-largest blockchain developer base in the world, India has already kick-started the revolution of decentralization and we’re here to fuel it,” Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said in a press statement.      As the cornerstone of that India strategy, the Binance-owned and Mumbai-based exchange WazirX is collaborating with the Indian startup Matic on DeFi protocol research. Both are also co-sponsoring a DeFi-centric hackathon this autumn called Build for Bharat.      Read more: India May Be Starting Its Biggest Bitcoin Bull Run Yet      Hackathon winners will be eligible for the above-mentioned accelerator fund, according to press representative Simran Alphonso, in addition to prize money contributed by various sponsors including Marlin and Google Cloud India.      The virtual hackathon will last until October, ending when five finalists receive 3,000,000 INR (roughly $40,000) in prizes. Alphonso said judges will be looking for projects related to DeFi.      One of the goals for this hackathon is to help the global Binance teams identify local talent, including opportunities for both investment and remote hires. Registration for the hackathon, which will select 100 participating teams, opens in September, with winners earning both prize money and a prospective investment from Binance.      Alphonso said crypto projects that receive investment from Binance’s $50 million Blockchain for India fund also get mentorship through the exchange’s first local accelerator program, Polaris, to help the recipient with everything from software tools to the go-to market strategy.

The dollar weakened.      The largest cryptocurrency is coming off a 2.2% decline in the seven days through Aug. 23, breaking a four-week string of gains.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      On the positive side, prices have now spent 27 straight days above $10,000, the third-longest period in the five-digit zone in bitcoin's 11-year history. According to Cryptoslate, the streak suggests ""$10,000 as strong support, which typically is a positive medium-term sign.""    Market moves    A week after First Mover wrote that cryptocurrency markets are now looking more capitalist than Wall Street, a new report suggests they also might be more democratic.      Mason Nystrom, an analyst at the digital-asset data firm Messari, wrote last week that digital tokens are giving ""anyone with access to a smartphone or computer"" the opportunity to bet on early-stage tech startups previously restricted to investors who were already rich.      ""The open nature of crypto networks has largely removed barriers that restricted early-stage investing to hedge funds or venture capitalists,"" Nystrom wrote. ""Hopefully, this will result in better capital allocation over time and democratize an industry that has for too long been limited to the wealthy few.""      The business of betting on the next Facebook, Google or Amazon can be risky but lucrative: According to VC News Daily, there's at least 14 venture capitalists with fortunes of at least $1 billion.      Because of investor-protection rules imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, clubby venture-capital funds have mostly been restricted to ""accredited"" individuals – those with a net worth of at least $1 million or annual income of $200,000.      Now, quick-to-market digital tokens like Compound's COMP and Spaghetti's PASTA are allowing anyone to bet on the fast-growing realm of decentralized finance, or DeFi. According to Token Daily, some of the projects come with ""frothy DeFi token valuations.""      But check out the demand from investors: No fewer than seven DeFi projects have market valuations of $500 million or more. That's 10 times the size of the Series C funding round that the centralized crypto lender BlockFi announced last week.      It's unclear why the SEC has allowed this culture of unfettered tokenholder democracy to proliferate, with its potential for fast riches alongside the risk of steep losses due to poor execution, scams or fraud.      This month witnessed the meme-worthy spectacle of YAM, whose market value plunged to $0 from $60 million within a span of 35 minute because of a programming bug in the unaudited protocol.      Perhaps the SEC is taking a wait-and-see approach. Perhaps the market is too small, young and irrelevant in the midst of a global pandemic to allocate precious agency resources. Perhaps ""governance tokens"" in ""decentralized autonomous organizations"" are just too complicated. Maybe they're even structured in such a way that they don't run afoul of the rules.      ""Accredited investor regulations are designed in theory to protect average investors from losing a bunch of their money, but they also prevent people from investing in startups, or in certain crypto assets where some people might actually have a decent amount of knowledge,"" Messari's Nystrom said in a Zoom interview.      There's a lot of similarities between crypto markets and Wall Street, such as fear and greed, leverage and luck. But at least for now, the playing field in crypto might be more level.      – Bradley Keoun, Editor, First Mover    Bitcoin watch    Bearish bets in bitcoin futures from leveraged funds recently rose to record highs on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) – though that doesn’t necessarily imply a fresh sell-off is coming.    In the week ended Aug. 18, leveraged funds – hedge funds and various types of money managers that, in effect, borrow money to trade – increased their short positions by 110% to a record high of 14,100 contracts.  The data comes from a Commitment of Traders (COT) report published by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Friday.  Institutional investors held 1,400 short contracts last week too, per the COT; a number that has also more than doubled.  Spot prices:  Having put in lows below $11,400 over the weekend, bitcoin has rebounded to over $11,790 at press time, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.  A series of higher lows (marked with arrows) seen on the daily chart suggest the path of least resistance is to the higher side.  The low of $11,367 registered on Saturday is the level to beat for the bears.

42384480,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAXcad,1598273472,Ethereum’s Fees Mean Choosing Between a World Computer and a Financial Network,"CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter is partner at Castle Island Ventures, a public blockchain-focused venture fund based in Cambridge, Mass. He is also the cofounder of Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics startup.      What was once an idle supposition is now concrete. Public blockchains are destined to privilege the largest, most fee-tolerant transactions, at the expense of non-financial uses.      When a robust block space market emerged on Bitcoin in 2017, some wrote it off as an aberration, believing the future was #FeeLess. Since then, Bitcoin’s bite-the-bullet approach to fees has taken hold: low-fee chains have suffered from bloat and irrelevance, and the second-most valuable blockchain, Ethereum, has effectively embraced the reality of meaningful fees. This heralds a shift in how major blockchains are perceived, moving away from generic computation layers and towards their destiny as financial infrastructure.      The logic for this shift is simple. Satoshi included the combination of fees and the blocksize cap in Bitcoin as both an anti-spam mechanism (to prevent the injection of arbitrary amounts of data that would make the chain impossible to validate) and as a method to compensate miners in the long term. Satoshi envisioned a future where fees alone would support miners, after the subsidy had run out.      See also: Nic Carter - How Blockchains Become Great Big Garbage Patches for Data      Today, that doctrine is largely unchanged; Bitcoiners still expect fees to eventually grow to 100 percent of miner revenue. (Bitcoin miners currently make 9.7% of their income from fees, according to Coin Metrics.) Capped block space is critical to make this work. In a finite system, transactors are willing to pay up for inclusion in a block. In uncapped alternatives, fees are effectively zero – and one can imagine that these chains will be forced to rely on perpetual inflation to finance security, or fall back to permissioned validators.      Aside from paying for security and warding off perpetual inflation, fees have additional emergent impacts. Effectively, they force transactors to think hard about what they are using the blockchain for. This encourages higher-value transactions and discourages frivolous use cases. In fee-bearing blockchains like Bitcoin, marginal, spammy, or non-monetary usage simply gets priced out over time.      As Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell says, there is infinite demand for highly-available perpetual data storage. As a result, low-fee alternatives become great big garbage patches. If you imagine fees as attaching a weight to transactions, you can see how fee-bearing transactions would force out more marginal ones from the auction for block space, like a lead weight displacing water from a bucket.    In fee-bearing blockchains like Bitcoin, marginal, spammy, or non-monetary usage simply gets priced out over time.    One great example of this displacement is Veriblock. Veriblock is a protocol which bids a fixed amount of its token, VBK, for Bitcoin block space. At its peak Veriblock transactions accounted for more than 30% of Bitcoin transactions. But, as Bitcoin fees perked up in May 2020, and VBK fell in value (and hence so did the amount of BTC it was bidding for block space), Veriblock transactions were squeezed out. Ordinary Bitcoin transactors ultimately outbid the more fee-sensitive use case.      Consequently, many Bitcoiners believe that, in the long term, the base layer will come to resemble Fedwire or CHIPS, large-scale settlement networks with large average transaction sizes. This has been the working assumption among developers for a long time on Bitcoin, and it’s part of the reason why Bitcoiners speak derisively of SatoshiDice and coffee payments: They don’t expect these would be suitable for base-layer transactions at maturity. You don’t send a wire transfer to pay for a stick of gum; payment methods are a function of your convenience and settlement needs.    On Ethereum    Mirroring Bitcoin’s high fee epoch in 2017, Ethereum has witnessed in 2020 the emergence of a healthy block space market. Driven by the popularity of stablecoins (most of which rely on Ethereum as the underlying infrastructure) and the rapid growth of DeFi, Ethereum fees have skyrocketed this year, peaking at 60% of miner revenue. Transactors on Ethereum paid $8.6m in total fees on Aug. 13, with per-transaction costs coming in at a median of $3.60.      Vitalik Buterin once stated in reference to Bitcoin that “the internet of money should not cost 5 cents a transaction.” It’s safe to say his attitude to fees, and that of Ethereans more broadly, has moderated with time. Delays in ETH 2.0, a growing understanding that unlimited block space has negative externalities, and a newfound appreciation for fees as the backstop of a potentially deflationary force have caused many Ethereans to embrace a higher-fee world.      The explosion of new liquidity mining opportunities on DeFi and the continued growth of crypto-dollars have priced out other use cases on the platform. The cost to deploy complex contracts has skyrocketed to hundreds of dollars in some cases. Today, a user sending a multi-million-dollar Tether transaction will most likely outbid someone deploying an Aragon DAO or minting an NFT.      See also: What Is Yield Farming? The Rocket Fuel of DeFi, Explained      This is sobering for some Ethereans, as it has punctured some of the more expansive visions of what Ethereum could become – at least in its present form. With high fees, the most economically dense transactions come to occupy block space to the exclusion of all else.      Ever since the departure of the big blockers, Bitcoiners have made their peace with this, prioritizing a layered approach in which the base layer is reserved for larger settlements. Bitcoin scales not by increasing the available supply of block space, but by minimizing the quantity of data registered on chain. Lightning scaling amortizes potentially thousands of transfers into a handful of on chain transactions.      Meanwhile, physical bearer instruments like Opendimes are funded once but can be passed around arbitrarily many times. Sidechains like Liquid hit mainnet for pegs in and out and thereafter allow asset issuance and transfer off chain. Even exchanges and custodians – many of which allow “on-us” transfers between users solely on their own database – can be understood as trusted sidechains. If exchanges move from a real time gross settlement model to a net settlement model, yet more block space will open up.      The commonality here is the introduction of deferred settlement to save on fees (by bundling many off-chain transactions together) and winning efficiencies.      Keep in mind, the above methods rely on an array of trust models, and they are not all equivalent to base-layer bitcoin transactions. But this is how payments work: some high-assurance payments require immediate final settlement, whereas in other cases users are content with deferred settlement. In fact the latter is often preferred, because deferred settlement introduces efficiency and allows for recourse if something goes wrong. The important thing is that bitcoin users have the option of making a base level transfer should they need to.    Today, a user sending a multi-million-dollar Tether transaction will most likely outbid someone deploying an Aragon DAO or minting an NFT.    It’s critical to understand that large-scale block space consumers have a strong incentive to minimize their footprint if wastefulness leads to higher fee liabilities. The rigidity of the blocksize and vibrant block space market means that Bitcoin punishes profligacy. This is why providers like Coinbase have latterly come to embrace space-saving measures like batching, after several years of demurral. Batching reduces the average size of a payment by incorporating many payments into a single transaction (which has a fixed cost in terms of bytes).      Ethereum’s relationship with fees is more complicated. Ethereum 2.0 is a specter that might produce a superabundant quantity of block space, although the execution of this vision remains in doubt. Ethereum itself is far more malleable in its key properties than Bitcoin, with the supply of available block space constantly changing. Increasing the gas limit effectively socializes transaction costs from users to node-operators who must shoulder a costlier validation burden.      Perversely, increasing block space means that heavy users have a reduced incentive to optimize their usage. The Ethereum technical community has devised multiple deferred settlement systems that could reduce the mainchain data impact of transactions, many of them falling under the ‘rollup’ designation. But for industrial consumers of block space, lobbying the developers or miners to increase the gas limit might prove cheaper than rearchitecting their backend to be more parsimonious.      In a sense, the willingness of the protocol architects to rapidly iterate on the core protocol parameters makes investing heavily in efficiency-enhancing processes less attractive. And the looming prospect of massively abundant block space threatens to derail this newly pragmatic attitude. Ethereum must choose between two visions: the low-fee, endlessly creative and resource intensive world computer, or the more economically dense financial settlement network.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET,Nic Carter,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/08/24/ethereums-fees-mean-choosing-between-a-world-computer-and-a-financial-network,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7affb845c6c7350dfc99a0b86460d7fca6f81d58-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384487,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAXcjR,1598266185,Leveraged Funds Take Record Bearish Positions in Bitcoin Futures,"Bearish bets in bitcoin futures from leveraged funds recently rose to record highs on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) – though that doesn't necessarily imply a fresh sell-off is coming.    In the week ended Aug. 18, leveraged funds – hedge funds and various types of money managers that, in effect, borrow money to trade – increased their short positions by 110% to a record high of 14,100 contracts.  The data comes from a Commitment of Traders (COT) report published by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Friday.  Institutional investors held 1,400 short contracts last week too, per the COT; a number that has also more than doubled  “Record shorts [by leveraged funds] were mostly likely a function of attractive cash and carry levels,” according to Skew, a crypto derivatives research firm.  ""Cash and carry"" is an arbitrage strategy that seeks to profit from mismatches in pricing between a derivative product and its underlying asset.  The method involves buying the asset on the spot market and taking a sell position in the futures market when the latter is trading at a significant premium to the spot price.  Futures prices converge with spot prices on the day of the expiry, giving a risk-free return to a carry trader.  Bitcoin futures, due to expire on Aug. 28, were trading at a premium of $400 earlier this month, as per TradingView data.  As the highest premium since April, that may have prompted leveraged funds to make carry trades. Other exchanges like OKEx also witnessed a surge in the futures premium, as discussed last week.  The premium has declined to sub-$100 levels in the past three trading days (CME futures are closed on Saturday and Sunday), making carry trades relatively unattractive right now.  Skew, therefore, expects the next CFTC report for the week ended Aug. 25 to show a decline in short positions.  Spot prices  Having put in lows below $11,400 over the weekend, bitcoin has rebounded to over $11,790 at press time, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.

According to a report from Chinese news source Global Times on Monday, internet users had suggested a house sale had been conducted in the major city of Shenzhen.  The seller had apparently been paid with a large amount of the digital currency being developed by the People's Bank of China, but had not been successful in converting it into the traditional version of the currency.  Later, an employee at the central bank reportedly told news source Sina that trials of the digital currency are currently solely focused on smaller retail transactions and that scenarios involving larger-sized transactions are not yet being addressed.  The digital money is legal tender equivalent to fiat-based yuan and is 1:1 exchangeable with cash, they added.  The central bank digital currency (CBDC) is currently being trialed across a number of regions, with an expansion into cities like Hong Kong also announced in the last two weeks.

42421059,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXBYvF,1598259600,No Collateral Required: How Aave Brought Unsecured Borrowing to DeFi,"Unsecured borrowing has come to decentralized finance (DeFi).  Aave, a DeFi money market that allows users to earn interest on cryptocurrency and borrow against it, introduced credit delegation in early July. This service allows someone with a lot of collateral deposited on Aave and no desire to borrow against it to delegate their credit line to a third party they trust. In return for essentially co-signing a loan to the trusted third party, the delegator gets a cut of the interest, juicing the return on their deposit.  The development represents a significant shift for DeFi lending, which until now has been predicated on only one of the traditional “four C’s” of credit: collateral. That’s to be expected when lending funds to complete strangers on the internet. Credit delegation is a step toward basing loan decisions on other factors, such as the borrower’s income, savings or track record of repaying debts (“capacity,” “capital” and “character” in the old banker’s formulation).  The step change comes at a time when DeFi is all the rage. On Aug. 15, Aave alone crossed over $1 billion in crypto staked to the overall platform, as measured by DeFiPulse. At present, nearly $7 billion worth of digital assets are staked as collateral fueling this new industry. Only four projects (MakerDAO, Compound, Aave and Curve) have had over $1 billion worth of assets staked at one time.  Read more: Lending Protocol Aave Eyes Tokenized Mortgages With Launch of V2  ""We are locking a lot of funds into DeFi,"" Stani Kulechov, Aave’s CEO, told CoinDesk in a phone call. ""We are looking at: How can we utilize that value as much as possible?""  On Aave, Kulechov said, around 75% of users aren't using their credit lines. They are just earning interest on the deposits (and governance tokens).  While it's natural to think in terms of person-to-person lending here, Kulechov said credit delegation is aimed more at institutional-level use cases and sophisticated, price-conscious trading outfits that need options for fast and easy credit. These include over-the-counter desks, market makers, traditional financial institutions looking to borrow stablecoins to trade into fiat for analog-world lending or smart contracts set up to run specifically delineated strategies.  The idea is not that Aave itself becomes the lender but that users with capital earning returns on Aave increase those returns by sharing their credit lines.  To be sure, this is a well-worn road in the traditional world that expands opportunity for many but gets people (sometimes a few, sometimes a lot of them) into trouble.  ""I think it's healthy and natural to experiment around these models. But they do have a lot of risks around them, for obvious reasons, if the assets can't be recovered in time for the primary owner,"" said Joseph Kelly, CEO of Unchained Capital, a company that writes loans against bitcoin collateral.  So how does credit delegation on Aave work? Here goes.  Without collateral, what's backing the loan?  Basically, relevant laws and contracts.  Aave provides access to OpenLaw contracts that allow the entity with the credit line to set up terms for their counterparty to agree to. They can turn to arbitration or the courts in the event of a default.  It's up to the collateral holder to decide which specific requirements to make of those they delegate to. The nice feature that OpenLaw provides, though, is reflecting the contract terms directly in the smart contract that governs the relationship.  ""I think the OpenLaw contract was just to show the possibilities. At the end of the day you can decide how to do it,"" Kulechov said.  How do the deals get arranged?  Right now, the Aave team is doing it and so far it has only done one, for Deversifi, an exchange. ""They are market-making,"" Kulechov said, explaining why an exchange would need to borrow funds.  In other words, this first deal is a long way from a consumer getting an unsecured loan to cover a medical bill or buy a washing machine. It reflects the vision for the services that it will provide liquidity sources to entities that can be verified as worthwhile credit risks.  Aave has not disclosed who delegated the credit to Deversifi.  Read more: DeFi Lender Aave Rolls Out Governance Token on Path to Decentralization  What we see today in the credit delegation is only a minimum viable product, Kulechov explained. ""Now we kind of match the delegators and the borrowers,"" Kulechov said. In other words it's Aave that promotes the project to people with large deposits and then finds suitable counterparties.  This hands-on process is not scalable, however.  So where is it headed?  This is where tokenomics, or in this case Aavenomics, comes in.  As Aave decentralizes, the vision is that the holders of Aave's governance token, AAVE, would begin handling the scaling of credit delegation. Users would set up pools (vetted and approved by the AAVE holders) where they would seek out entities looking for liquidity options and assess whether they were good credit risks.  Then delegators could look at those pools and decide whether to delegate to them. It would always be up to collateral stakers whether or not they wanted to delegate their credit and whether or not the risk profile of a specific pool was attractive.  ""Basically we make it more scalable so we don't need to match these deals,"" Kulechov said.  Read more: Aave’s LEND Token Is Now Up 1,600% in 2020  Kulechov believes DeFi could become a very attractive source of liquidity for use cases even outside of crypto.  ""The idea is that this credit delegation could become a wholesale debt market. Which means if you are a facility in DeFi, CeFi, traditional finance, you could source part of your liquidity from Aave,"" he said.  Meaning even online lenders that are making loans to regular people in the real world might borrow stablecoins on Aave and convert them to fiat to lend, because Kulechov believes that DeFi will be able to beat interest rates on liquidity sources they usually use, such as private placements and bonds.  This has yet to be tested, but it's the future Aave is eyeing with credit delegation.  How can delegators manage default risk?  Mainly by carefully vetting the borrowers they allow to use their credit lines, or ""underwriting,"" as bankers call it.  But for additional protection, another relevant project is Opium, which announced Saturday it had created a credit default swap (CDS) on the Aave protocol. A CDS is a contract that insures the buyer against a third party defaulting on a loan. The seller collects a premium and in return stands ready to make the buyer whole for potential losses on the loan.  In addition to risk management, CDS can be used for speculation by parties uninvolved in the loan, and these instruments are best known for their role in the 2008 financial crisis. Over the weekend Opium's announcement elicited no shortage of snarky ""what could go wrong?"" reactions on crypto Twitter (which also made light of the project's name). To be fair, some argue that CDS provide markets with an early warning signal of credit problems.  What about the thing with mortgages?  This is still a work in progress, but the vision is that RealT would tokenize home equity. Then AAVE holders could vote to accept those home equity tokens as collateral on Aave.  If that happens, it would mean both that people with home equity could potentially have a modest way of earning a small return on it and that they could also use it as a home equity line of credit. Obviously this could be quite dangerous, as MakerDAO users learned last year, when users took out personal loans for real-world needs only for the interest rates to spike when the system was tested for the first time.  That said, Aave has mechanisms for lending at stable interest rates. Regardless, new industries just need to take these shots, Kelly said.  ""I don't think there's a time when it'll be obvious that the market and technology are mature enough to try these models out,"" he wrote. ""There will be some that implode, either due to credit mismanagement (if centralized) or technology and market issues if decentralized.""  Kulechov made a similar point.  ""I think innovation should not wait. If you have the ability to get it done, I think you should get it done. But I think always we need to be aware of the risks,"" he said. ""We definitely need to go slowly and securely.""  Originally known as EthLend, Aave was funded by a $17 million initial coin offering in November 2017. The team has not released a timeline for the release of version 2.

42384486,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAXciB,1598256000,Istanbul or 'Coinstantinople'? Inside Turkey’s Bitcoin Bull Market,"Turkish bitcoin users are already waist-deep in a bull run, as partially illustrated by growing exchange volumes.      BTCTurk CEO Ozgur Güneri, head of the largest crypto exchange in Istanbul, with the most Turkish banking access of any exchange in the region, said volumes roughly quadrupled over the past year, attracting roughly 100,000 active monthly users by July 2020 out of nearly 1 million accounts.      “August might be the highest volume ever and the highest level of registrations in any month this year,” he said. “This also correlates to the volatility in prices.”      Whatever the cause, the relationship between economic crisis and crypto exchange activity in Turkey appears to have changed.      According to data analyzed by CoinDesk Research, BTCTurk volumes in September 2018 and June 2019, actually came at times when the Turkish lira was getting stronger, rather than at times of peak inflation. However, this pattern flipped with the COVID-19 crisis that hit Turkey especially hard in April. Since then, exchange volume surges have roughly coincided with talk of a renewed lira crisis.      So far, BTCTurk has dominated the Turkish market, growing faster than many other compliant exchange platforms in the Middle East. Güneri said the best way to market bitcoin is still by using mass media. They sponsor mainstream cultural institutions, such as the national Turkish soccer team, to spread brand awareness, and advertise through mass media broadcasts as well.      “The second layer is the educational layer; we’ve been investing in educational TV programs,” Güneri said, referring to both YouTube programs and traditional TV shows the exchange sponsors.      See also: Bitcoin in Cuba: A Local YouTube Influencer Explains How It Works      Beyond mainstream media advertising, BTCTurk is sponsoring a bitcoin-focused podcast and Kriptometre, a YouTube talk show with Turkish celebrities, currently filming its third season.      “We believe trust is still the main area that we have to invest ... to cooperate with large brands and institutions,” Güneri said. “the DNA of the average Turkish person is inclined toward hard assets.
