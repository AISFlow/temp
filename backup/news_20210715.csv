42434838,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPtr7h,1626386724,"Amid Health Crisis and Economic Embargo, Cubans Are Using Cryptocurrencies to Help Compatriots","Some Cubans protesting their government are turning to cryptocurrencies to get donations to people who need them.      Residents in Cuba began protesting the government earlier this month, pointing to an economic embargo on the country and the rapidly worsening COVID-19 crisis. Cases nearly doubled on July 9, with positive results hitting 6,422 after only 3,664 the day before. Matanzas, the most affected province, registered half of the cases.      On Twitter, hashtags #SOSCuba and #SOSMatanzas became trending topics in different parts of the world.    Lee este artículo en español.    Seeing what was happening in Matanzas, local entrepreneur Thais Liset started to think of ideas to aid her compatriots in that province and decided that donations would be the best option to help address the lack of medical supplies and food.      Along with Cuban YouTuber Frank el Makina, Liset sought help from Erich García Cruz, one of the top Cuban crypto influencers who leads projects such as BitRemesas and QvaPay, two ventures focused on facilitating the inflow of remittances and the collection in dollars by Cubans using cryptocurrencies.      Following the request, Garcia Cruz created a temporary account within QvaPay to receive donations without any commission.    ""All transactions are publichttps://qvapay.com/payme/sosmatanzas so that everything that is happening in real time can be audited,"" he told CoinDesk.    The cryptocurrency initiative seeks to receive money from Cubans abroad. Crypto provides the easiest and fastest way for individuals to donate, said García Cruz, who added that Cubans in Cuba were the ones who contributed the most. The initiative also allowed fiat transactions from Cubans in Cuba, although the number of cryptocurrency remittances was higher, he said.      Many Cubans living abroad didn’t have accounts at crypto exchanges, García Cruz said.      “They are friends who live abroad and do not know much about how to operate cryptocurrencies, so we guide them step by step on how to buy in Binance or Coinbase,” García Cruz said.      According to García Cruz, transfers in dollars are prohibited as an embargo imposed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control in the U.S. punishes banks that carry out those operations.      However, he said some European banks aren’t covered by the ban, and private remittance agencies such as VaCuba and FonMoney were set up to circumvent the U.S. sanctions.      FonMoney, for instance, receives transfers from euros, pounds sterling, Mexican pesos, Chilean pesos and Swiss francs. It then offers conversion to Cuban pesos or U.S. dollars and remittances to accounts in Cuba or prepaid cards, according to its website.      Cubans have no access to Visa or Mastercard products because of the U.S. trade embargo, while Western Union, the world's largest money transfer service, suspended U.S. dollar transfers to Cuba in November following the latest sanction from the Trump administration.      Additionally, a drop in the tourism industry caused by the pandemic affected those Cubans who had income in dollars on the island.      In June, Cuba announced it would temporarily stop accepting cash bank deposits in dollars, arguing that U.S. sanctions restrict its ability to use that currency abroad. Bank transfers would continue to be available, the government said.    The initiative    According to García Cruz, $2,000 has been raised so far, and crypto donations mainly help Cubans who don’t receive assistance from relatives abroad.      Another crypto company that has joined the donation initiative is Slyk.      ""It can be used in Cuba by people who want to collect donations with any payment methods from Venmo to bitcoin,"" Tim Parsa, the CEO of Slyk, told CoinDesk.      Donations will be used to purchase medicine and masks to help Cuban people in Matanzas and other cities.      Slyk’s community manager and representative in Cuba is Camilo Noa, one of the ideologues behind the crypto donations.      ""So far we have purchased medicines, masks, alcohol, hand gel, chlorine, food, personal hygiene, clothing and other supplies. Donations have been delivered to people, hospitals and isolation centers,"" he told CoinDesk.      According to García Cruz, no system or institution is overseeing the deliveries.      ""It is about Cubans helping Cubans, being supportive and transparent with those who need it most,"" he said.      Liset provides updates on her Twitter account on the quantities purchased, prices and the people to whom crypto donations are provided.      After the government began arresting protestors, donations to Matanzas were put on hold, as people don’t want to leave their houses, Liset said.      ""Everything was going well. With special permits, we ourselves were sending medicines, medical supplies, food,"" she said.      Donations are currently earmarked for health personnel and patients of the so-called “Covid-19 Red Zone” in Matanzas. However, that could change in the future, as García Cruz has not stopped receiving requests from different provinces in the last few days.      The Council for Democratic Transition in Cuba, recently created by opponents to the regime, issued a humanitarian crisis statement characterizing the health situation in Matanzas as ""chaotic"" on Saturday.      ""Other provinces are already joining the initiative because the chaos is total and the need for help is everywhere,"" García Cruz said.      According to the local opposition media outlet 14ymedio, dozens of complaints were made about the collapse of the healthcare system, deaths of patients in their homes, a lack of medicine and medical supplies, and poor medical care.      As a response to the role of social media in the protests, the regime started cutting off internet service.      NetBlocks, a global internet monitor, posted on its Twitter that social media and messaging platforms have been restricted since Monday on state-run internet provider Etecsa.      Cuban sources confirmed to CoinDesk that there are internet outages. In some cases, the sources took up to a day to respond to Telegram messages.      In this context, cryptocurrency transactions are also ""considerably affected,"" Noa said.      As seen in the public registry of QvaPay, no new donations have been registered in the last two days. According to García Cruz, this is happening because of the internet outages and many people have not even been able to use their wallets. ""To that we have to add that there is a lot of political fear,"" he said.    Outside the system    According to García Cruz, the most common cryptocurrencies used for donations are bitcoin and USDT, although the platform also accepts litecoin, tron and bitcoin cash, among others.      Once donations in crypto are received, they are exchanged on the black market to fiat then used in the MLC stores — Spanish acronym for convertible free currency — where products can be purchased with foreign currency, García Cruz added.      After generating the anger of part of the population, several of these stores were looted recently.      In the last year, the number of MLC stores has multiplied in the country and concentrated the majority of food and basic goods. However, the majority of Cubans do not have access because they do not receive their salaries in dollars or euros.      On January 1, Cuba ended its dual currency system by eliminating the Convertible Peso (tied to the U.S. dollar) and leaving the Cuban Peso in circulation, strongly devaluing the Cuban Peso, which now trades at $0.042.      However, García Cruz said that the exchange rate on the black market is higher, of 60 Cuban Pesos per dollar, while cryptocurrencies are exchanged at 50 Cuban Pesos due to a supply and demand factor.      Noa said that most Cubans do not understand the use of cryptocurrencies and those seeking help prioritize getting cash to buy food and medicine they need. García Cruz, however, estimates that there is a big crypto community of about 200,000 people in Cuba.

42434852,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPtrPh,1626384668,Voorhees Applauds Crypto's Hyper-Capitalism as ShapeShift Goes 'Gray',"Run-ins with regulators was one of the motivations behind ShapeShift’s plan to shut down and convert into a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), founder Erik Voorhees said.      In an appearance on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” Thursday, the day after the crypto exchange’s bombshell announcement, Voorhees also provided more details on what will happen to the company, including its employees.      “Regulatory friction absolutely has a part in this decision,” said Voorhees, who started the exchange in 2014.      “I wish there were more people willing to be brave and to push boundaries and fight for principle instead of just trying to get along and make some profit,” he said, adding that sometimes that means businesses have to operate in a “gray area.”      One of the earliest entrepreneurs in crypto, Voorhees has tussled with regulators since one of his oldest companies, SatoshiDice, paid a $50,000 fine to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2014 for failing to register an offering.      The crypto industry is still dominated by centralized companies, but Voorhees said Thursday expects more to follow ShapeShift’s lead.      “Ultimately, if you’re custodial you’re never really bringing the most important attributes of cryptocurrency to your users,” he said, referring to the contradiction between decentralized and centralized companies like Coinbase.      Voorhees himself will no longer be the CEO of ShapeShift and will go from 30% ownership in the company to a 5% controller of its FOX tokens. This still makes him an influential member of the project, but he can easily be outvoted and controlled by other stakeholders, he said.      All existing employees will receive a “healthy” supply of FOX tokens and will get part of the proceeds from selling the company’s assets over time, Voorhees said. He reiterated that this is not the primary concern and that “everyone that invested is here for the revolution” and to “try something new.”      Staff members will end their traditional W2 employment in three waves throughout the year; while some will remain part of the project, others may move on to other projects. All employees have received a “healthy” supply of FOX tokens as well.      Voorhees sounded excited about attracting new talent. “[We’ll] have thousands of diverse people from all over the world,” he said. Instead of working the traditional 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., employees will be able to work flexibly, for example 30 minutes once a month, and they will get paid in FOX tokens.      “It makes them all entrepreneurs,” he said, emphasizing there’s a lot of risk involved in that kind of job but that he has encountered a lot of people who have the right, entrepreneurial, creative energy for such work.      Voorhees wouldn’t comment further on discussions with regulators. From a corporate perspective, the company’s transformation is treated as a liquidation of the company’s balance sheet and the ending of a corporate entity.      Voorhees also commented on Jackson Palmer’s tweet thread calling the cryptocurrency industry a “scam,” and said he agreed with a lot of what the Dogecoin founder said, especially the idea that crypto is “hyper capitalistic.” But to Voorhees, that’s a feature, not a bug.      “It is hyper-capitalistic, and thank goodness there’s actually a system that is hyper-capitalistic that is supposed to be what America was about, [...] a free market, capitalist country,” he said. The good thing about crypto is that unlike fiat and the banking establishment, it is purely voluntary, he said, and the industry will remain a “peaceful” place as long as self-custody is maintained.      “If cryptocurrency ends up in a bunch of custodians only, it will lose the most important properties that it has brought,” he said.

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the Senate Judiciary Committee’s top Republican, warned the Biden administration’s acting drug czar that bitcoin is fueling $76 billion in “illegal transactions” every year.

He warned this feature “makes it difficult” for investigators to “detect and catch” narcos.      However, Bitcoin is far from an anonymous system. Indeed, as former Justice Department honcho Katie Haun argued recently in the New York Times, Bitcoin’s pseudonymous and public ledger may have made it easier for federal authorities to track down ransom paid to the hacking group that ground the Colonial Pipeline to a halt.      Beyond baseline misassumptions, there’s a problem with Grassley’s conclusions, four cryptocurrency tracing companies told CoinDesk: They don’t align with the facts.      “Those figures are based on outdated and deeply flawed analysis,” said Tom Robinson, the chief scientist for Virginia-based investigations company Elliptic, which has counted the several U.S. agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Agency, Internal Revenue Service, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and FBI as clients. Their agents know first hand that bitcoin is “highly traceable,” he said.      “Researchers disagree regularly,” George Hartmann, Grassley’s deputy communications director, told CoinDesk when asked for comment. “Senator Grassley cited a figure from academic research.”    Bitcoin’s brand baggage    The incident points to the image challenges bitcoin faces in Washington, D.C., where policymakers eager for soundbites are quick to float sketchy data that demonizes a technology they might not understand.      Researchers at Chainalysis and Merkle Science shared similar estimates with CoinDesk. Percentage-wise, only a sliver of the multibillion-dollar bitcoin market is flowing through drugs, ransomware, trafficking and other nefarious deeds, they said.    Read more: Inside Chainalysis’ Multimillion-Dollar Relationship With the US Government    Chainalysis, the largest blockchain analysis company, has estimated crypto crime was a $10 billion industry in 2020 when it comprised 1% of all transactions. That’s a sizable jump from its 2017 estimates – around $7 billion and 0.7% of transactions – but well below Grassley’s number, which he attributed to a 2019 policy memo on freepolicybriefs.org.      That memo summarizes a 2018 academic paper titled “Sex, Drugs, and Bitcoin: How Much Illegal Activity Is Financed Through Cryptocurrencies?” It divined Grassley’s quoted answer – $76 billion annually – by extrapolating on darkweb address data, wallet explorers and news reports, according to a source within the crypto research community.      But the researchers' attempt to trawl crypto’s darker corners cast perhaps too wide a net, the source said after reviewing the author’s methodology. Just one hint of illicit activity in a wallet would taint the entire wallet under the researchers’ methods. This has the primary effect of pumping up the amount of bitcoin flagged as being suspicious, the source said.      “I think it's safe to say these numbers should not be seriously used to inform policy,” the source said.      Mary Beth Buchanan, the chief legal officer for Merkle Science, said the Grassley press release may be dabbling in “confirmation bias.”      “One tends to look for data that confirms one’s beliefs,” she said.    The reality of it    Grassley’s stated belief is that cryptographic technologies make law enforcement’s job more difficult by keeping bad actors anonymous. This makes them dangerous, he said in his open letter.      Jesse Spiro, chief of government affairs for Chainalysis, said cryptocurrencies are “more transparent” than most other payment rails because they operate on public ledgers.    Read more: State of Crypto: Ransomware Is a Crypto Problem    ""It's a common misconception that cryptocurrencies are anonymous, untraceable, unregulated, and primarily used for illicit purposes,” he said.      In reality, federal investigators readily exploit the transparent nature of blockchains to “follow the money” and bust criminals, he said. This is especially true of online drug markets, a frequent target of investigations and raids.      This was on display last September when agents bagged a massive drug ring in California, in part by tracing bitcoin transactions. It is increasingly difficult to maintain the cryptocurrency’s pseudonymity through cash-out, as HSI Special Agent Christopher Hicks said in an FBI news story on a multimillion-dollar bust:      “People think cryptocurrency is this anonymous platform, but there are things we can exploit to find out who people are. It’s not truly anonymous,” he told the FBI.      Agents already know the “true scale of the issue,” Neeraj Agrawal of Washington, D.C.-based crypto think tank CoinCenter said. But policymakers who get their data from three-year-old datasets might not, making good intel even more important when crafting legislation (and perhaps fueling a recent boom in crypto-tracking funding rounds).    Read more: Crypto Sleuthing Firm Chainalysis Raises $100M, This Time at $4.2B Valuation    Ari Redbord, head of government affairs for TRM Labs and a former federal prosecutor, said policymakers need to understand that blockchain technology serves to help investigators.      “Crypto actually enables great financial crime investigators to stop illicit activity in ways previously unimagined,” he said. “That needs to be acknowledged in any discussion like this.""      Robinson, the Elliptic executive, also pushed back on Grassley’s assertion that cryptocurrency is largely unregulated. To the contrary, he said, it's closely monitored by officials – especially in the U.S.      ""Like any payment system, cryptocurrencies are used by criminals – but policy should be based on an accurate picture of the scale and severity of the issue,"" Robinson said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/07/15/republican-senator-highlights-bitcoins-battle-in-shedding-criminal-baggage,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b4d274a072388d9c8d4f38503f16b36b8011a45f-1500x968.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434856,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPtrVh,1626382269,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Slides Toward $30K, Looks ‘Fragile’","Bitcoin prices slid Thursday by the most in 10 days, falling in sync with U.S. stocks, as analysts warned that the market might be primed for a fresh leg down.      “Bitcoin does look fragile,” Lennard Neo, head of research for Stack Funds, wrote in an investor update. “Unless we see a clear break into the positive region, it is difficult to assume the speculative bulls are back.”    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $31631.9, -3.48%  Ether (ETH) $1923.5, -3.03%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4360, -0.33%  Gold: $1828.4, +0.08%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.303%, compared with 1.34% on Wednesday    Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, testifying before the U.S. Senate, weighed in on two areas dear to cryptocurrency traders – the prospect for outsize inflation as the economy reopens and the possible, eventual rollout of a digital dollar.      Powell said he was surprised at how quickly inflation had ticked up. A report earlier this week showed that U.S. consumer prices rose at their fastest pace in 13 years. Federal Reserve officials have characterized the uptick as “transitory,” a rationale for maintaining low interest rates and monthly purchases of $120 billion in Treasury or mortgage securities without fears of runaway prices.      It’s a crucial matter for bitcoin traders who have bet either that the cryptocurrency will hold its value as the dollar’s purchasing power weakens or that it would face selling pressure as a risky asset if the Fed moves to rein in its monetary stimulus.      “We're experiencing a big uptick in inflation, bigger than, than many expected, bigger certainly than I expected,” Powell said. “And we're trying to understand whether it's something that will pass through fairly quickly, or whether we're in fact, we need to act one way or the other.”      Separately, Powell said he was undecided on whether the benefits of central bank digital currencies outweigh the costs. “The more direct route” would be to regulate stablecoins, Powell said, as reported by CoinDesk's Nate DiCamillo. “Our obligation is to explore both the technology and the policy issues over the next couple of years, so that we’re in a position to make an informed recommendation.”      The remarks came a day after Powell testified before the U.S. House of Representatives that “you wouldn’t need stablecoins, you wouldn’t need cryptocurrencies,” if there were a digital dollar.    Why bitcoin needs to defend $30K    The simplistic days of trading by scanning technical charts and the spot market order book are passé, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reports.      The bitcoin market has matured since the March 2020 crash, and participants can no longer turn a blind eye toward macroeconomic developments and activity in the futures and options market.      That was especially the case on Thursday, when the sentiment against assets deemed to be risky on Wall Street put downward pressure on bitcoin and pushed the cryptocurrency toward the $30,000 support level, which, if breached, could invite more selling pressure from options traders, leading to a quick slide.      With bitcoin locked in the broad range of $30,000 to $40,000 since mid-May, many options traders have been selling puts at the $30,000 strike and selling calls at the $40,000 strike.      But bitcoin is pushing toward the lower end of the range at $30,000. If that level breaks, traders who sold puts at that level may resort to hedging downside risk by shorting bitcoin futures or selling bitcoin on the spot market.      “If support or resistance levels break, traders will need to quickly hedge because prices will move to new levels fast,” Greg Magadini, CEO of Genesis Volatility, said. “The hedging activity from various traders on the same side of the volatility trade also creates a self-reinforcing event.”    Google Searches for ‘Bitcoin Price’ Reach 7-Month Low    Web search data shows the general populace has lost interest in bitcoin, thanks to the usually volatile cryptocurrency going silent in recent weeks, Godbole reports.      Google Trends, a widely used tool to gauge general interest in trending topics, is currently returning a value of 19 for the worldwide search query “bitcoin price” over the past five years.      That’s the lowest reading since December and marks a significant decline from the peak of 86 observed two months ago. Google Trends provides access to a mostly unfiltered sample of actual search requests made to Google and scales their searches on a range of 0 to 100, according to the company.      The cryptocurrency’s two-month-long dull price action of $30,000 to $40,000 seems to have driven away retail interest, which surged earlier this year.    Nodes on Bitcoin’s Lightning Network double in 3 months    The Lightning Network has increased its capacity by 100 bitcoin in just five days, the fastest growth ever, CoinDesk’s Myles Sherman reports.      The network capacity has climbed to record levels above 1,800 BTC locked in, data show.      In April, the network reached a milestone of 10,000 nodes and had just over 45,000 payment channels holding 1,158 BTC. The number of nodes has since more than doubled to 22,781, while the number of channels jumped to 56,103.      For context, it took nearly a year for the number of nodes to double last time from 5,000 to 10,000.      Lightning Network’s development has been slow, steady and cautious – like anything else that promises to be a major step forward for Bitcoin. But as other coins and chains touted “faster, cheaper transactions,” many bitcoiners were becoming increasingly impatient for Lightning to be ready for prime time. Even now it’s not quite there, and developers caution users that it’s still in the early stages of development.      The big picture is that the Bitcoin network by itself is seen as slow, processing up to seven transactions per second. That ""throughput"" would need to increase by magnitudes in the thousands or even millions in order to host the global economy, mostly because any blocks written above 1 megabyte are invalid on the current Bitcoin mainnet.      “With on-chain fees going up with bitcoin appreciation cycle, it’s becoming an imperative to use Lightning as a low-cost alternative to transfer smaller amounts of bitcoin,” Oleg Mikhalsky, a partner at Fulgur Ventures, a firm that specializes in researching and investing in Lightning-focused projects, told Sherman.

42434850,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPtrRh,1626379801,Market Opens Betting That Cardano Won't Release Smart Contracts by Oct. 1,"A prediction market opened Thursday allowing participants to bet on whether the Cardano blockchain will release smart contract functionality by Oct. 1.      The market has had a trading volume as of this writing over $157,000. Shares were trading at $0.37 for ""yes"" and $0.63 for ""no."" Whichever answer is correct will be redeemable for $1 in the USDC stablecoin.      More expensive bets are the ones seen as more likely to be correct, so this market currently leans to a prediction that smart contracts will not be live on Cardano when October begins.      Tech timelines are notoriously unreliable and hard to predict. However, the Alonzo testnet that is supporting key features of smart contract development for Cardano's forthcoming Goguen era has been making steady progress with the launch on Wednesday of its second hard fork to the ""White"" phase.      Prediction markets allow people to bet on outcomes of real-world events, from elections to basketball games. Proponents tout them as a superior way to gauge sentiment among experts, since money is on the line, compared to pundits who have nothing to lose if their prognostications turn out wrong.      While the largest such markets are operated by centralized platforms like PredictIt, newer ones run on blockchain networks, including Augur (on Ethereum) and Polymarket (on the Polygon sidechain).      Cardano is the home chain of ADA, the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. According to the Cardano roadmap, smart contracts will go live when the project enters its third era, Goguen. It began its second era, Shelley, in July 2020.      In contrast, the largest market by trade volume in the crypto category on Polymarket right now is a bet on whether Ethereum's proposed upgrade, EIP-1559, will launch by the end of July. That market has seen a trading volume of $315,000.      Co-founded by Charles Hoskinson, one of the original co-founders of Ethereum, the original smart contract chain, the Cardano blockchain was built by the company IOHK and went live in 2017.      In a tweet Thursday, Hoskinson expressed incredulity about the betting on Polymarket, though it was not clear if he was scoffing at the higher price for “no” shares or the market’s very existence.

42434840,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPtr9h,1626377260,Jackson Palmer vs. Spike Lee: 'Inherently Right Wing' or 'Digital Rebellion'?,"In a head-turning Twitter thread yesterday, Dogecoin co-creator Jackson Palmer reiterated he has no interest in participating in crypto, arguing the technology is “inherently right wing.” But in a juxtaposition for the ages, yesterday also saw legendary filmmaker and pro-Black advocate Spike Lee praise crypto as “the digital rebellion” against a financial system that has historically oppressed people of color and women. He did this in a commercial for crypto ATM company Coin Cloud.      It’s a debate that nobody’s going to definitively resolve anytime soon. But behind it is a bigger and more interesting question: Can technology even have a political bias?    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist.    It’s a tricky one to get your head around, but at its heart is the distinction between form and content. The form of a painting, for instance, is a painted square that hangs on the wall, while its content can be just about anything. Rewind the debate five hundred years and you’d have heard Palmer and Lee arguing over whether the technology of hanging a painted canvas on the wall was inherently authoritarian – which might sound a bit silly, but is still a topic of debate among historians and art critics.      There’s an entire intellectual tradition focused on the analysis of the built-in bias of various technologies, particularly communication tools (and crypto is indeed a communication technology). Scholars trace the debate as far back as 370 BCE, when Plato argued in ""The Phaedrus"" that relying too much on writing would have negative social impacts, including weakening people’s memories. The debate really took off in the mid-20th century, when the revolution of broadcast and electronic media led scholar Marshall McLuhan to declare that “the medium is the message” – that the form of a communication technology shaped its social impact far more than its content.      McLuhan made his most subtle points in his analysis of the printing press. We’re usually taught to regard that invention as the gateway to a new era of mass literacy, the Protestant Reformation and even the rise of democracy. But McLuhan argued that the form of print promoted a particular linear, logical way of thinking that paved the way to managerial capitalism as much or more than it promoted democracy.      This highlights a category error by Palmer and certain other critics including scholar David Golumbia. In his thread, Palmer argues that crypto as a whole is “controlled by a powerful cartel of wealthy figures” with “shady business connections.” I also loathe the seemingly ceaseless manipulation of crypto systems by bad actors, but it’s a claim about the content of these systems while Palmer’s conclusion that “cryptocurrency is an inherently right-wing, hyper-capitalistic technology” is about their form.      As McLuhan argued, there is no straight line connecting the two. A system or technology can be manipulated for the benefit of the powerful without necessarily being “inherently hyper-capitalistic.” There’s a good argument that crypto empowers those who already have power because of its resistance to regulation and taxation, but similar arguments could be made for most innovations that extend human power. Existing elites usually find ways to turn innovation to their own ends, a bias arguably built into human civilization rather than any single technological innovation.      “I think [Palmer] is missing the forest for the trees,” says The Blockchain Socialist, a crypto advocate who hosts a podcast devoted to far-left applications of blockchain tech. “There are plenty of right-wing elements in the current makeup of the space, but if he still describes himself as 'leaning socialist' then surely he should be interested in the radical potential for making political change [such as] through DAOs [decentralized autonomous organizations] to facilitate democratic management of digital commons.”      Alex Gladstein of Human Rights Watch has focused on the potential of a deep element of crypto’s technological form: uncensorability. Many authoritarian governments worldwide exert control over their populations through financial restrictions. The same technology that enables the scams and manipulation Palmer hates also offers a way to work around those restrictions, whether for basic survival or the decentralized funding of resistance movements.      Spike Lee’s pro-crypto message, though condensed (or watered down) into an emotional pitch, is also ultimately focused on the form of financial technology rather than its content. In the two-minute Cloud Coin spot, Lee declares that “old money … is flat-out broke,” emphasizing the literal whiteness of the faces on U.S. currency and decrying the broader system “systematically oppressing” people of color and women.      Similar points have been explored in-depth by Isaiah Jackson, author of “Bitcoin and Black America.” Jackson’s argument focuses on the way the centralized technology stack of the legacy banking system led to systemic injustice, thanks to its inherent quality of concentrating power in the hands of bankers. Those bankers, overwhelmingly part of America’s white ruling class, have used their concentrated power to enable practices like redlining, which perpetuated de facto housing segregation well into the 1990s and in the process robbed the Black community of a huge source of generational wealth.      Jackson, in essence, argues that given that history, a technology that’s not inherently controlled by the powerful is an appealing alternative for marginalized people. Crucially, this argument holds even if Palmer’s claims about the influence and manipulations of powerful people are also true. Much as with the printing press, the transformative power of blockchain networks is too profound to be neatly positioned along any contemporary political spectrum, particularly this early in its evolution.      Crypto contains multitudes, for better and for worse. It is a new thing in the world, and its consequences will be deep and often even directly conflicting. Rejecting that complexity may be less of a bold political stance than a step back from the constant work of shepherding politics through an era of ceaseless innovation.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | DOGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,David Z.

42434831,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPtqth,1626375470,Strike's Jack Mallers on Fixing the Fiat Problem,"Jack Mallers is wearing a hoodie. That’s not so unusual, as the 27-year-old founder of Strike is almost always wearing a hoodie. But this one is different. It’s pink, it’s bright, and it has a cartoon drawing of Mallers and the president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, along with the phrase “We Got This.”      The phrase is a callback to a speech Mallers gave at the Bitcoin 2021 conference, where he outlined how his Strike app, using the Lightning Network to speed up bitcoin transactions, would help improve people’s lives in El Salvador. For every problem involving El Salvador’s money, we got this. High remittances fees? We got this. Worries about inflation? We got this. Threats of gangs who want to steal your physical cash? We got this.      And get this he did. As everyone even remotely curious about crypto knows, on June 9, the El Salvador government voted to officially make bitcoin a legal tender. Mallers was the man of the hour, he became chums with Bukele, and he was now suddenly prominent enough to receive a security detail. Why security guards? As Mallers puts it, for “making a geopolitical statement that's arguably the biggest in the last couple of centuries.”    Read more: The Lightning Network Is Going to Change How You Think About Bitcoin | Jeff Wilser    No one knows what will happen with El Salvador’s embrace of bitcoin. The range of outcomes is wide. It might be a failed experiment, a curious stunt that will be remembered decades from now only by financial historians and the nerd kings of trivia night.      Or it might, quite literally, change the world if bitcoin is widely adopted. Maybe it happens with the toppling of this domino. The idea isn’t lost on Mallers. “I think it [El Salvador’s vote to accept bitcoin] does more for the world generally than just El Salvador as country,” says Mallers, who breaks down his rationale for launching Strike in El Salvador, shares how (and why) it’s actually being used and predicts that Strike will be “one of the most powerful consumer brands of all time, like an Apple.”      CoinDesk: Why start with El Salvador?      Jack Mallers: As a country, it's this really interesting remittance problem. And the more you learn, you kinda realize it's very broken in a really unfair way. El Salvador tried to launch a nation-state currency. It didn't work. It's like a failed startup. So they now use the dollar, but because of the lack of financial stability and the civil war they went through, they ended up becoming a very violent country.      So you kind of end up having two options. You can join a gang and support your family by committing, like, malicious crime, or you leave and you live in South Florida and you're a busboy and you send money home.      You end up having over 20% of their country's GDP (gross domestic product) in remittance. And those people are getting charged up to 50% [in fees]. And then you learn about the fixed costs and the legacy financial system, and you realize the problems that come with dealing with physical cash is tremendously dangerous.    Read more: Strike Is Phasing Out USDT From Bitcoin-Based El Salvador Remittances, CEO Says    Dangerous how? I mean, I can kind of guess, but what do you mean specifically?      This is a problem I became familiar with in the cannabis industry, because my parents run a dispensary. We operate a massive security budget to protect the six figures in cash that's there all the time. Holding physical currency is extremely dangerous and leaves you vulnerable all the time. So these people are taking six-hour bus rides, getting 20% to 40% taken by Western Union, and then gangs sit outside and take another 10% to 20%. They come home with less than half of what the sender sent.      Damn.      They’re dealing in the same currency [U.S. dollars], so there’s no forex problem, but there’s this massive bullying and bulls**t with the security problem. It’s really sad.      So anyways, it was kind of like, if we can fix that problem, well, surely we would do a lot of good in the world. It sounds like we would improve the quality of life, improve the security of the country.      Do you have a sense of how Strike is being used in El Salvador?      A variety of ways. Obviously, remittance. But then what people don’t understand is that in the U.S., we have Cash App and Venmo, and we are very privileged in our financial experience.      Right, right.      The notion of having a dollar balance on our phone, and being able to pay back a friend for chicken wings, or to pay your landlord rent from your phone … that’s an extreme convenience. And they [in El Salvador] don’t have that.      So, first, the hook is remittance, because you’re saving money and it’s much safer and it saves you time. That's just general convenience. And then they have a dollar balance on their phone and they're like, ""Wait a second. So, if I pay for the pupusas [El Salvadoran stuffed corn cakes], then Bob over here can pay me back from his phone."" That's a tremendous convenience. There's no cash under the mattress.      Then we started to see a lot of P2P (peer to peer). And then the most fascinating and important thing, in my opinion, is spending the money on the Lightning Network in an open network. They immediately found a service called BitRefill. They sell mobile top-ups and gift cards over Lightning.      This is important and fascinating [because] it hammers home the thesis that I hold: Open networks win. We didn't have to build, like, an in-store marketplace to sell gift cards. Someone else did that. But we didn't enter an MSA (master services agreement) with them. There's no commercial agreement. It just works. How does it just work? Because we all integrated the same open-source payment standard.      Interesting.      So all of a sudden, these people found themselves with money on this application that was interoperable with thousands of other services in the world that I've never talked to or spoken to. And then we saw a huge volume uptick.      People get their remittance. Then they realize, ""Hey, I can pay my friends back. Hey, this store has Bitcoin Beach, while this one has a different Bitcoin wallet. This one has Strike. I can spend and buy groceries, I can take Ubers with it, and then all of a sudden, I can top up my phone bill, I can buy Amazon gift cards."" People were like, “This is just a more convenient way to live.""      We took a country that's in the developing world and we gave them a cash app. And they held it in their hand and they were like, “Holy shit. This is awesome.""      If El Salvador is phase One, what do you envision being phases two and three for Strike?      So, as a business, we think there's a very unique property in Strike, in that we are the Bitcoin brand. Whether you're a president, an NFL player, a musician, you call Jack.      I don’t deal with Ethereum, I don't meet with Congress about launching a ”colored coin casino” or something. Bitcoin. Bitcoin. I'll die for Bitcoin. That’s a brand that scales globally and very naturally.      Bitcoin is global.      Right. Like, the Cash App tried to launch in the U.K. It didn't work. Revolut tried to launch in the U.S. It didn't work. Strike's wait list globally is massive and it's because that brand scales globally. Everyone resonates with having an awesome experience on this open interoperable network. So we think we have a very unique position in delivering tools to the world, because the world speaks the same language as us [and] holds the same passion. This payment standard is global. It's not like the ACH (automated clearing house) in the U.S. So we plan on launching everywhere.    The best money in the world is open source    What people don't understand about Strike is that we carry the property of an open network where the world is our target audience, but we’re a financial services firm. And us making money acts in the best interest of our users. So in theory, Strike has the mechanics and the DNA to be the biggest company in the world and build one of the most powerful consumer brands of all time, like an Apple.      From a very high level, that's how we think about it. And we definitely have a different road map for the developed world.      How so?      In Europe, in the U.K. and in the U.S. we have a partnership with Visa, and we have direct deposit products – a lot of these fintech experiences that we know work and that we know people enjoy.      And in the developing world?      We’re developing a lot of different infrastructure, like local physical cash points, because a lot of this world doesn't bank. So what’s the point of integrating with a bank if no one has a bank account? We’re using different approaches, but very actively in parallel ... We’re trying to address all eight billion people as quick as we can.    Read more: Jack Mallers’ Strike Rolls Out Bitcoin Buys, Going Head-to-Head With Coinbase    What was it like for you when El Salvador officially adopted bitcoin?      From a Bitcoin standpoint, it was a blast. It was really fun. And I'm a huge believer in bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador. I think it's a fantastic thing and I think it does more for the world generally than just El Salvador as a country.      How about from a personal standpoint?      It was very overwhelming – the notion that I would need security, that I'm now a making geopolitical statement that's arguably the biggest in the last couple of centuries.      How did you deal with that?      I just kind of begin to associate it as part of the job. And my dad always jokes with me, ""If you think it's too overwhelming and you don’t like it, well then just quit. But if you want to continue to contribute to the world in this way, then, like, stop being a p***y.""      Amazing. What’s your biggest takeaway from watching the El Salvador process unfold?      The biggest takeaway for me is the [power of the] free market. I actually advised against the government having a government wallet. We have no commercial agreement with them, and there’s a conspiracy that I have some backdoor wallet ready for them. No. The government can use our API (application programming interface) just like Starbucks can, just like a normal developer in Australia can.      But I'm a huge proponent that the free market is what's going to drive innovation, and embracing open networks and the free market is the only correct way to do this. And I am of the opinion that as soon as the government does try and step in and mandate something as mandatory, or come out with a commercial version themselves, it really disincentivizes everyone else from diving in and competing and allocating resources. And I think they're learning that on the fly too.      So that's been my biggest takeaway: The best thing to do is to embrace the free market and the openness of the network.      Final question, and it’s a hardball: What’s your obsession with hoodies?      Growing up I never wore jeans in school. I didn't dress up. I never owned a suit. As you get older, you want to look sharper to get girls. But I didn’t. I played chess in a hoodie. I came to school in sweatpants every single day because I was just ... that’s where I was the most comfortable.      I get it.      It's kind of this ethos that, you know, I don't optimize for other people. There are certain classes in school I just didn't go to. I was a terrible student. ""Well, why? Like, “Why don't you put on jeans and go do English?"" And I’m thinking, “Jeans are uncomfortable, and I don't understand how English is going to help me do what I'm interested in.""      Hard to argue with the results.      So I just didn't do it. I try and stay true to myself, and the hoodie does take on a kind of culture and mind of its own, and I do use it intentionally and tactically to kind of polarize against the suit.      I’m guessing there’s an analogy here about bitcoin …      Because it's an open network, because the best money in the world is open source, anyone can do it. You don't have to go get a degree, you don't have to wear certain things. Like, the guys in hoodies are the ones that really determine human behavior now, as they should. It’s kind of that ethos.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/15/strikes-jack-mallers-on-fixing-the-fiat-problem,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42434844,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPtrJh,1626372814,Why Bitcoin Needs to Defend $30K,"The simplistic days of trading bitcoin by scanning technical charts and the spot market order book are passé.      The bitcoin market has matured since the March 2020 crash, and participants can no longer turn a blind eye toward macroeconomic developments and activity in the futures and options market.      That was especially the case on Thursday, when the risk-off mood on Wall Street put downward pressure on bitcoin and pushed the cryptocurrency toward $30,000 support, which, if breached, could invite more selling pressure from options traders, leading to a quick slide.      With bitcoin locked in the broad range of $30,000 to $40,000 since mid-May, many options traders have been selling puts at the $30,000 strike and selling calls at the $40,000 strike. These trades were booked on Deribit and other crypto-derivatives exchanges in hopes the consolidation would continue, leading to a drop in the implied volatility and the value of calls and puts.      A put option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy. In plain English, selling a put option is akin to offering insurance to the put buyer against a price sell-off below a particular level – in this case $30,000.      ""After the mid-May selling, volatility hit peak heights, but since then spot prices have been trading in a base range. These types of consolidation periods are perfect environments for lower-volatility trades,"" said Greg Magadini, CEO and co-founder of Genesis Volatility. ""The main idea is for prices to meander between support and resistance, and traders sell options expecting these levels to hold.""      But bitcoin is pushing toward the lower end of the range at $30,000. If that level breaks, traders who sold puts at that level may resort to hedging downside risk by shorting bitcoin futures or selling bitcoin in the spot market. That, in turn, could add to bearish pressures around the cryptocurrency, leading to a more profound price drop.      ""If support or resistance levels break, traders will need to quickly hedge because prices will move to new levels fast,"" Magadini said. ""The hedging activity from various traders on the same side of the volatility trade also creates a self-reinforcing event.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/15/why-bitcoin-needs-to-defend-30k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/49efe434ddc09b130aee7053a4901e3cae2f617f-1200x800.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434848,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPtrNh,1626369345,OpenBazaar Co-Founder Explains Why Web 3’s Answer to eBay Folded Its Tents,"For those who believe in the power of cryptocurrency to create Web 3.0, the demise of OpenBazaar this year came as a disappointment.      On Jan. 4, the project’s leadership announced that OB1, the for-profit company that developed the OpenBazaar open-source software, would cease supporting the marketplace’s wallets, APIs, search engine and website. Since September, the project had been relying on community donations for funding, having almost exhausted the $9.25 million OB1 had raised from venture capitalists since 2015.      Not any old VCs: Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures, which had backed nearly every important internet company of the last two decades, were in OB1’s cap table (as was Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk).      OpenBazaar sought to do for e-commerce what Bitcoin had done for electronic payments: make it open to all comers by replacing centralized gatekeepers with a peer-to-peer network, like Napster instead of eBay. Users had to download special software to participate in the market rather than browsing listings on a web page.      Founded in 2014, the project was an offshoot of DarkMarket, which, as the name implied, aimed to create a version of the notorious Silk Road contraband marketplace that couldn’t be shut down. The OpenBazaar team discouraged such use cases, blocking illegal items from the built-in search engine. Still, by design, the team couldn’t prevent illicit trade from happening on the network.      I recently caught up with Brian Hoffman, the former CEO of OB1 and co-founder and project lead for OpenBazaar, who now works at the crypto exchange Kraken. He candidly reflected on OpenBazaar’s accomplishments and missteps and gave advice to anyone looking to take up the mantle. A lightly edited transcript of the conversation is below.      If you’re wondering why anyone would want to create an uncensorable marketplace for anything other than criminal activities, especially after this one fizzled, I’ve got a post coming on Friday. For now, I’ll stay out of the way and let Hoffman tell his story.      CoinDesk: Why didn’t OpenBazaar take off?      Brian Hoffman: OpenBazaar was pretty impactful in many ways. We were one of the first truly decentralized applications (dapps) for crypto before there was even a name for it. The software was installed over 250,000 times and our Haven app, which brought OpenBazaar to mobile, had more than 100,000 downloads on its own.      As to why OpenBazaar didn’t take off for mainstream usage, there are countless possible reasons. The biggest one I can point to is that crypto, particularly bitcoin, evolved from a cheap, cash alternative into a store of value – a digital gold – that didn’t make it conducive to daily Amazon-type e-commerce purchases. When Ethereum came along and took the dapp thunder from Bitcoin, we were hesitant to get on board. I’m not certain if that would have necessarily helped as there haven't yet been any Ethereum-based alternatives to OpenBazaar that have gained much traction. Most have pivoted to digital-only goods or [non-fungible token] sales, which are far better suited for the instantaneous nature of cryptocurrency.      Looking back, what would you have done differently?      There are many things we could have done differently. First, we should have spent much more time on some kind of web version, or focused solely on mobile. We spent too much time building a complicated, high-maintenance desktop application. It was always clunky and unreliable and never really encapsulated the experience I had envisioned.      We should have also figured out a way to add stablecoin support for the marketplace. That would have created price stability and mitigated the volatility that inhibited people using the e-commerce platform. From a business perspective, we never charged users a fee for using the platform, which limited our revenue options and made it hard to operate at a profit or raise additional venture capital. That hurt us in the long run.      In which ways did the emphasis on decentralization serve OpenBazaar well, and in which ways didn't it?      Building software that relied on a stable and secure peer-to-peer network, with private Tor-based communications and private key protection, which could also interact with cryptocurrency software, was extremely difficult. A lot of today’s dapps are just Javascript code that talks to [the Ethereum wallet] MetaMask and has a few smart contracts they deploy. In contrast, we had our own custom Bitcoin wallet code, a homegrown peer-to-peer network, a complex data contract language and more.      Ultimately, OpenBazaar enabled everyone to sell anything to anyone anywhere in the world for free. We never had to remove users from the platform or reverse transactions. I don’t know of any instances where someone was prevented from selling something on OpenBazaar.      Yet, the OB1 search engine blocked illicit items for sale. Why was that?      Anyone could run a search engine and choose to filter or not filter listings. OB1 being a U.S. company, we followed all local rules and regulations for filtering illegal listings from our indexes. We originally had a fully decentralized search engine built into OpenBazaar but it was very slow and not optimized for real-world usage. We subsequently moved to a federated model similar to BitTorrent.      The code is still out there and anyone could pick up where you left off. What advice would you give someone trying to build a decentralized P2P goods marketplace now?      It was incredibly important for us that the code for OpenBazaar remained open source. We started as an open-source project and wanted to make sure all our hard work could be used as the foundation or reference point for future work.      Still, I think anyone interested in building a new decentralized P2P marketplace needs to think hard about who their end customers are. There’s a massive difference between a customer trying to send hard-to-find medicine across the world undetected to a loved one versus someone wanting to buy an inflatable pool for their kids. We didn’t make that distinction and fell into the trap of trying to out-engineer our problems. Sometimes listening to what your users need is what matters most.      Tell us about your new role at Kraken.      Winding down the company and stepping away from active OpenBazaar development was quite depressing for a while, as I think it probably is for any founder who doesn’t succeed. I was lucky enough, however, to already be connected with Kraken where I now serve as the crypto platform product lead. I’m responsible for managing the rollout of new token listings on the exchange, overseeing our new Parachain Auction platform and much more. I’ve found my role extremely rewarding. Kraken has a lot of new and exciting products and services coming down the pipe and I look forward to being able to share more as soon as we can.      Oh, and I’m also now the host of the Parachain Auctions Podcast, which has given me a chance to talk with a ton of project teams who are working on decentralized software in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.

42434837,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPtr5h,1626366559,Bitcoin Doesn't Care if You Think It's Right Wing,"Bitcoin is a looking glass into which we gaze and see a mirror image of ourselves.      As some estimates indicate there are currently north of 100 million cryptocurrency users worldwide, or roughly the population of Japan, limitations of time, availability of information and human working memory mean we are necessarily blind to the fullness of cryptocurrency as an ecosystem. There are use cases we cannot comprehend, inventions we have not yet seen, motivations we do not understand. When we criticize cryptocurrency, we must be mindful that the content of our critique may have more to do with what we cannot see than that which we can.    Preston Byrne, a CoinDesk columnist, is a partner in Anderson Kill's Technology, Media and Distributed Systems Group. He advises software, internet and fintech companies. This is not legal advice.    We are long past the stage where generalizations about crypto are intellectually useful. This has not prevented some from trying to make them, often in 280 characters or less. Jackson Palmer’s recent tweetstorm on bitcoin is one such example. Palmer is the co-founder of Dogecoin, a project that requires no introduction. Palmer eventually retreated from cryptocurrency to work at Adobe after the joke project acquired a life of its own.      In his tweetstorm, Palmer refers to cryptocurrency as an “inherently right-wing, hyper-capitalistic technology built primarily to amplify the wealth of its proponents through a combination of tax avoidance, diminished regulatory oversight and artificially enforced scarcity[.]” He criticized the industry as being a hive of dishonest media and billionaire hustlers who exploit the vulnerable, move markets with tweets and cynically evade their legal obligations.      Is Palmer right? In some cases, sure, but this is still a cheap shot, one first made – unconvincingly, in my view – six years ago by Virginia Commonwealth University academic David Golumbia. Yes, crooks and fascists use bitcoin; they also breathe air and use TCP-IP. Yes, they were disproportionately prominent in the early cryptocurrency days; this is no longer the case.      Palmer’s critique hits all the right notes, using all the right language that would under normal circumstances could set off a letter writing campaign of the type that makes most PR departments panic (“Did you hear, our service is being used by – gasp – right-wingers!?”). This necessarily precipitates a deplatforming and groveling public apology, a pattern that, in the recent past, has resulted in the removal of politically radioactive individuals – Alex Jones comes to mind – from web platforms, payment processors and banks alike.      The difference is bitcoin and any cryptocurrency worthy of the name runs on game theory powered by proof-of-work, not politics. It feels nothing and answers to no one. Increasingly, we see other functions – social media, content distribution and monetization, and even entire businesses – adopting a bitcoin-style modality of decentralized operation. These services, too, will have no opinions and no masters.      Designing such systems well is no easy task. Apart from bitcoin itself there are no clear early winners. We can be sure that whatever winds up becoming decentralized PayPal or Twitter will not be cognizant of partisan language or hit pieces from think tanks or news magazines long past their prime.      Whatever conversations we choose to have in public about these systems, we will conduct them with the knowledge that however angry we get, however loudly we yell, whatever rhetoric we employ, these systems will ignore us, continue to run and continue to be used by people we loathe. One can only hope this makes us more civil with one another.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | DOGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Preston J.

If signed into law, the Securities Clarity Act would treat digital assets as commodities, not securities, meaning startups would be free to sell and trade cryptocurrencies without having to worry about registering them as securities with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC).      Emmer, the bill's lead sponsor and a member of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, said ""regulatory uncertainty"" has been harmful to the crypto industry's growth within the U.S.      ""There has been an unreasonable approach by regulators as to how federal securities laws should be applied to transactions involving the sale of blockchain-based tokens, and this lack of clarity is hurting American innovation,” Emmer said.

The attacks occurred on ApeRocket's Binance Smart Chain and its Polygon fork within a few hours of each other on Wednesday, according to a blog announcement.  The two hacks were carried out in Aave and PancakeSwap and amounted to a combined $1.26 million.  In both cases, substantial funds were borrowed in AAVE and CAKE, meaning the hacker held over 99% of the funds in the two protocol's vaults. Large amounts of money were then sent to the vault contract leading to the minting of a high number of tokens, which the hacker then dumped.  The price of ApeRocket's SPACE token crashed by around 63% as a result. No further SPACE tokens will be minted in the meantime while ApeRocket sets about compensating investors for the incident.  Yield farming refers to a process by which individuals can earn interest or rewards on crypto deposits they make with lenders. DeFi apps allow users to make financial transactions without going through a traditional intermediary like a bank.

42406944,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8ct9,1626355750,Google Searches for 'Bitcoin Price' Reach 7-Month Low,"Web search data shows the general populace has lost interest in bitcoin thanks to the usually volatile cryptocurrency going silent in recent weeks.      Google Trends, a widely used tool to gauge general interest in trending topics, is currently returning a value of 19 for the worldwide search query ""bitcoin price"" over the past five years.      That's the lowest reading since December and marks a significant decline from the peak of 86 observed two months ago. Google Trends provides access to a mostly unfiltered sample of actual search requests made to Google and scales their searches on a range of 0 to 100, according to the company.      The cryptocurrency's two-month-long dull price action between $30,000 and $40,000 seems to have driven away retail interest, which surged earlier this year.      Search queries typically rise when the price volatility is high and existing, and potential investors search for information regarding the ongoing bullish/bearish market action.      For example, the Google search value spiked from single digits to over 60 in the three months to early January as bitcoin surged from $10,000 to $40,000. Retail interest dwindled in the following two months when bitcoin was stuck in a $50,000 to $60,000 range. Retail interest rose to new peaks in May as prices began falling.      A rise in the Google search value does not necessarily imply increased buying or selling pressure. Often, investors search for information but don't act. Nevertheless, traders keep an eye on Google search values because peak retail interest, a sign of fear of missing out (FOMO), is often considered a sign of the market nearing a significant top. Similarly, record-low retail queries are taken to represent the lowest point of the bear market.      While the search value has come off significantly from its May peak, it remains slightly above the average value of around 10 observed between May 2018 and September 2020.      Other social measures also point to declining mainstream attention. For instance, the seven-day average of the number of bitcoin mentions on social media, including Telegram, Reddit, Twitter, recently fell to a six-month low of 1445, according to analytics firm Santiment's weekly research note published Monday.      The note added that the average mood of daily bitcoin-related mentions is leaning overwhelmingly bearish. Further, the cryptocurrency's relative social dominance, which compares the number of daily BTC mentions against those of several other top-cap assets, has declined from 80% to 60% in four weeks.      From a contrarian standpoint, declining general interest and bearish mood could be a harbinger of good times.      Also read: Bitcoin Under Pressure, Faces Support at $30K      ""Low levels of crowd chatter and a bearish bias may work in the top coin’s favor, signaling undervalued conditions and a potential for short-term recovery,"" Santiment said. ""While historical performance is not indicative of future results, several of bitcoin’s price recoveries in the past two years have coincided with a predominantly bearish sentiment.""

42406923,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8caS,1626352081,UK Regulator to Launch £11M Campaign Warning of Crypto Risks,"The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is launching an £11 million (US$15 million) marketing campaign to warn young people of the risks in investing in crypto.    The move was announced by CEO Nikhil Rathi in a speech Thursday as part of a webinar on the FCA's role as a proactive regulator.  Citing recent research that found almost 2.5 million Britons hold cryptoassets, Rathi highlighted the FCA's concern that crypto holders are more likely to be younger and behave ""less rationally and more emotionally, egged on by anonymous and unaccountable social media influencers.""  ""This is a category of consumer that we are not used to engaging with, 18 to 30-year olds more likely to be drawn in by social media, "" Rathi said.  He compared crypto to what happened to GameStop shares in January, when a trading frenzy driven by Reddit forum WallStreetBets pushed the company's stock as high as $483 from $18 at the end of 2020.  The FCA campaign follows hard on the heels of its counterpart in the advertising industry planning to tighten its monitoring of the crypto market.  The Advertising Standards Authority said July 9 it would be proactively looking for potentially misleading or irresponsible ads for crypto products, as opposed to its previous approach, which had been more reactive.

The stake values LMAX, which operates exchanges for forex and crypto trades, at $1 billion, LMAX said in a statement on its website.      The move will allow J.C. Flowers to accelerate the growth of its foreign-exchange and crypto-asset businesses.      London-based LMAX operates five exchanges globally. In 2018, it started LMAX Digital, an exchange for spot crypto that has more than 500 institutional clients.      Cryptocurrency accounted for 11% of LMAX Group volumes in the firm’s first half results, CEO David Mercer said in an interview, and just over 30% of revenues.      The fact that a finance-focused private equity player of the calibre of J.C. Flowers is taking an interest in crypto could generate a degree of frisson in the digital asset space. But Mercer played this down.      “I wouldn’t classify J.C. Flowers as crypto evangelists; they are far from it,” Mercer told CoinDesk. “They are specialist financial services investors, and they've invested $16 billion over 22 years only in financial services. They see the future of capital markets the way we see it.”      LMAX Digital is the largest institutional cryptocurrency exchange by volume.      The exchange, which prides itself on having zero down time even in periods of very heavy use, registered a record daily volume of $6.6 billion back in May when the price of bitcoin dropped precipitously.

The Digital Law Association, an association of technology lawyers, and global law firm Herbert Smith Freehills are lobbying an Australian Senate committee to propose the creation of the new entity, the Australian Financial Review (AFR) reported.      Such a move would give legal standing to the blockchain-based organizations, enabling DAOs to contract with other legal persons.      A DAO is a decentralized network of nodes organized through blockchain code. It may include members and nodes from around the world. Members usually participate in decision-making by voting with governance tokens.      For the purposes of corporate governance, boards of directors would be replaced with internet communities. Having a limited liability structure would prevent every member from ""being potentially liable for losses incurred by decisions made by a member of the community,"" the report said.

CoinWorld will stop all website and app operations in China, effective immediately, a notice on the website posted at 9 p.m. China Standard Time (13:00 UTC) said.      The site is following provisions laid out in a document on cryptocurrencies issued by the Business Administration Department of the People's Bank of China, the announcement said.      The website was last updated at 8:42 p.m. local time.      Financial news site Jiemian reported the news earlier today, without saying where it got the information.      CoinWorld was investigated by Beijing authorities in 2019 for illegal token issuance, local media reported at the time. China outlawed initial coin offerings in 2017.      CoinWorld's app was already been delisted from Chinese app stores, one Twitter user reported earlier on Wednesday.      Founded in 2017 and based in Beijing, the app had received backing from prominent Chinese tech venture capitalists, including Shunwei Capital and ZhenFund.      Chinese regulators have repeatedly expressed concerns that crypto trading is bringing undue financial risk to the economy, particularly as mom and pop investors enter crypto markets.      In late May, China's council of ministers, the State Council, called for a crackdown on crypto mining to ""control financial risk.""

Greenidge is trying to clean up bitcoin's environmental impact, using ""low-carbon sources of energy"" and carbon offsets, the company said. It owns a natural gas energy plant in New York that powers its nearby mining facility.  The company plans to expand in South Carolina and go public through a merger with IT firm Support.com.  Founded in August 2020 by DCG with a $100 million investment, Foundry is trying to boost North America's hash power. China's crackdown on crypto mining is providing a tailwind for the company.

42406929,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8cgM,1626338658,China's Bitcoin Mining Share Was in Decline Even Before Crackdown,"University of Cambridge data shows China's share of the bitcoin mining industry was in steady decline even before the country's crackdown in May.    According to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF), China accounted for a 46% share of the industry in April 2021, compared with 75% in September 2019.  The methodology is based on China's share of the power of computers connected to the bitcoin hashrate.  Data after April is not available, so it is unclear how China's crackdown on mining has affected the figures.  The Chinese state began taking harsher steps against the mining industry in late May, shutting operations in several regions rich in the coal and hydropower that miners been using.  The main beneficiaries of the decline appear to be the U.S. and Kazakhstan, according to the CCAF.  The U.S. share has more than quadrupled since September 2019, sitting at 16.8% as of April.  Kazakhstan has become the third-largest producer of bitcoin, with a share of 8.2%.  There have been signs in recent weeks that the central Asian country is the preferred destination for mining firms migrating from China, with BIT Mining and Canaan both establishing operations there in the past month.

42406943,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8csA,1626336643,Bitcoin Trending Down After Earlier Gains,"Bitcoin remains on a downward trajectory toward $32,000 despite rallying as much as 4.6% during the early trading hours in Asia on Wednesday.      Bouncing from a 24-hour low of $31,620, prices were hovering at just around $32,500 at press time after they had reached a 24-hour high of $33,182, CoinDesk data shows.      The gradual slide is continuing to eat into year-to-date gains, which stand at just above 12%.      Intraday volume for the world's oldest cryptocurrency remains considerably lower than weeks past, with the number of coins traded every four hours having tapered since the June 29 sell-off.      Yet, according to some, that may be an indication of greater things to come.      The stalemate between bulls and bears in bitcoin's ever-narrowing range between $36,000 and $31,500 may soon come to an end, some analysts are suggesting.      ""All the on-chain analysis suggests we're at the tight end of a slingshot,"" BCB Group CEO Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie told CoinDesk via Telegram. ""It’s quiet now but don't mistake that for lack of interest.""      Landsberg-Sadie said it's ""anyone's guess"" about how close bitcoin would get to $100,000 when the ""tension breaks.""      Indeed, June 29's peak of $36,623 marked the last time bitcoin's intraday spot price maintained a higher low, higher high setup. That indicates the price action is now firmly in the seller's court.      Some observers are suggesting bitcoin may get a boost later this month following the expiration of investor restrictions on the sale of shares in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, as CoinDesk previously reported.      “Price pressure may actually never realize,"" Kirill Suslov, CEO of trading app TabTrader, said about Grayscale releasing nearly 40,000 bitcoin shares (GBTC). Grayscale Investments is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.      ""Usually, institutions rebalance their portfolio according to the mandate. So if they are underwater because the bitcoin price has dropped, they will actually have to buy more to keep the mandated allocation to this asset class,"" Suslov said.      Because Grayscale's Trust lacks a redemption mechanism, Laurin Bylica, co-founder of a decentralized crypto finance project TheStandard.io, said the unlocking of GBTC shares shouldn't move bitcoin's spot price.      ""However, misleading and complex information lets investors worry and, therefore, can create short-term bearish anxiety,"" Bylica said in an email.

Richard Harris, the customer and plaintiff, is alleging T-Mobile's misconduct including its failure to adequately protect customer information, hire appropriate support staff and its violation of federal and state laws led to his loss of 1.63 bitcoin.      Harris is demanding a trial by jury, according to a court document filed last week in the U.S. Eastern District of Pennsylvania.      This isn't the first time the major U.S cellphone carrier has faced litigation over its alleged breach in its duty of care over customer data and loss of bitcoin. Earlier this year, T-Mobile was sued over a SIM-swap attack that resulted in the loss of more than $450,000 in bitcoin.      A SIM swap is a scam involving the purchase of a new prepaid SIM card. A bad actor contacts a company representative, in this case someone from T-Mobile, convinces the rep they are the victim and asks the rep to port the victim's old number to a new prepaid SIM.      From there, the bad actor can gain access to bank accounts and crypto exchange wallets and have an access code sent as a text message to the prepaid SIM.      ""Numerous instances of mishandling of customer account information have occurred at T-Mobile,"" the complaint by Harris alleges.      Specifically, Harris argues T-Mobile violated the Federal Communications Act, which stipulates that a cellphone carrier must protect the “confidential proprietary information of [its] customers” and “customer proprietary network information.”      Harris is seeking restitution for actual, statutory, treble and punitive damages as well as for lawyer fees and prejudgment interest.      A T-Mobile representative said the company is unable to comment on pending litigation.

42406934,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8ckI,1626319445,Las Vegas Strip Club Now Accepts Bitcoin Payments Over the Lightning Network,"A Las Vegas strip club is taking its first step toward accepting bitcoin payments over the Lightning Network in a bid to speed up payments, lower costs and provide privacy to clients.      Crazy Horse 3 says it has become the first major entertainment venue in Las Vegas to accept payment using Lightning.      Bitcoin payment processor and infrastructure provider OpenNode is overseeing the club's new payment rail, which enables guests to make purchases on the club's website.      Bitcoin's Lightning Network is a layer-two protocol system designed to settle transactions off-chain in a bid to cut down the time it takes to use the world's oldest cryptocurrency and reduce the fees associated with bitcoin payments.      When Bitcoin was unveiled in 2009, it could settle seven transactions per second (TPS). Now as the network and number of users have grown, so too has the demand on Bitcoin's infrastructure.      The Lightning Network attempts to solve that by increasing the maximum throughput to 25 million TPS. That is an important for businesses like Crazy Horse 3 that accept bitcoin as a form of payment.    Read more: The Lightning Network Is Going to Change How You Think About Bitcoin  Lightning also offers an extra layer of transaction privacy. For instance, its nodeshttps://nodes.com/ use Tor's anonymous communication network known as onion routing. The routing affords nodes the ability to send transactions through each other while keeping the bitcoin transacted encrypted.    ""We are embracing the opportunity to accept bitcoin as a way to deliver convenience, first-class hospitality and an added level of anonymity for our guests,"" a Crazy Horse 3 representative said in a statement.    What's in it for the Horse?    Located a stone's throw away from the new Allegiant Stadium, home of the National Football League's Las Vegas Raiders, Crazy Horse 3 is not exactly tucked away. Like most adult entertainment businesses, the club faces financial judgment in the form of being labeled a ""high-risk"" industry, and so the fees it pays to payment processing companies via traditional rails are higher. Fees charged by using bitcoin as a form of payment are much lower.      Bitcoin payments can help international clients flying into Las Vegas because they don't need to use their debit or credit cards to make fast payments.      So far, the club is accepting bitcoin payments only for bottle service, but it plans to expand transactions to include ""admission, food selections, craft cocktails, retail and the club's signature 'dance dollars,' valid toward lap dances and entertainer tipping.""      Tipping is where the Lightning Network has the potential to truly make an impact. Under the conditions of privacy, lower fees, and faster payments, the ability to pay entertainers in satoshis or ""sats"" – fractions of a whole bitcoin – those on the receiving end can forge entirely new local economies.      Onchain bitcoin microtransactions would be prohibitively slow and expensive. But payments on Lightning are ideally made in smaller increments, just right for tips.

42406940,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8cqC,1626315334,White House Plans Ransomware Task Force: Report,"The White House is creating a new group to investigate and tackle ransomware, including cryptocurrency payments, Politico reported Wednesday.      The task force will try to find ways of ""halting ransom payments made through cryptocurrency platforms,"" the report said. It will also try to help potential ransomware victims bolster their internal defenses and launch attacks against ransomware operators.      The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) will host a conference, and other branches of the government will provide different resources for potential ransomware victims, according to the report, which cited Anne Neuberger, the White House's deputy national security adviser for cybersecurity and emerging technologies.      A spokesperson for FinCEN didn't respond to CoinDesk's request for comment by the time of publication. A spokesperson for Neuberger couldn't immediately be located.      Ransomware has become an increasingly important focus for U.S. lawmakers and federal officials after several high-profile attacks on different infrastructure firms, including Colonial Pipeline and JBS, a meat processing company. Both companies paid ransoms in bitcoin to their attackers, though federal officials were later able to recover most of the amount paid by Colonial Pipeline.      More recently, software firm Kaseya suffered a ransomware attack, which may have affected hundreds of other firms that rely on Kaseya's product to help manage their computer networks.      Earlier on Wednesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee announced its plans to hold a hearing on ransomware later this month, and other lawmakers have sent companies questions about paying ransoms.      It's unclear what sort of proposed regulations around crypto may emerge from the White House's task force. Members of an international Ransomware Task Force said in an April report that more consistent enforcement of anti-money laundering and know-your-customer laws would be the most effective tool for preventing payments, rather than attempting to ban cryptocurrency or prevent its use entirely.
