42387612,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQloUP,1614038309,Attention Kraken Shoppers! Ether Was Half Off at $700 During Monday’s Crypto Sale,"No, it wasn’t a misprint.  Ether (ETH), the second biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, at one point traded on the Kraken exchange at less than half the prices found on other exchanges during Monday’s massive sell-off.  Amid the market melee that pummeled crypto assets across the board, ether’s price went as low as $1,546.53, down from around $1,800, according to CoinDesk 20 data. However, that number was a staggeringly low $700 on Kraken.  In a one-minute time span, the ETH/USD pair on Kraken dropped to $700 at UTC 14:20 Monday from $1,628.82 just approximately three minutes prior.  The breathtaking drop wasn’t only relegated to ether. Trading of cardano (ADA) suffered a similar fate on Kraken, with the ADA/USD pair slumping to $0.156 at 14:23 UTC from $0.842 three minutes prior. During the same hour, the lowest price of cardano recorded on CoinDesk 20 was at $0.835.  “We saw the price of some digital assets such as ether and ADA have a sharp downward movement this morning on multiple trading venues just after 14:00 UTC,” a spokesperson from Kraken told CoinDesk in response to the abnormally low prices of ether and ADA on the exchange. “Kraken also saw a surge in sell orders around this time.”  “We’re communicating directly with clients and ask that anyone with questions about their account please open a ticket,” the spokesperson said, declining to comment further on the issue.  This is not the first time this type of “flash crash” occurred on Kraken, according to Trustnodes, which noted the problem on Kraken in 2018. The report indicated that such incidents usually occur when a trader accidentally entered a wrong number during trading, a behavior nicknamed “fat finger error.”  Ether’s trading volume on Kraken logged more than $888 million on Monday alone, more than double that of Friday’s figure.  At press time, ether is trading at $1,749.94, down 8.92% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk 20 data. On Kraken, it's at $1777.02, down 8.19%.

42433678,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP0Tbh,1614037226,Bitcoin Trades in Record $11K Daily Range After Dropping From $58K,"Bitcoin (BTC) traded within a record-setting $10,877 range Monday after plummeting from its all-time highs above $58,000 set over the weekend. This marks the leading cryptocurrency's first five-figure daily price range.    Bitcoin dropped from its Monday high of $57,577 on Coinbase to a low of $46,700 before rebounding to pare most of its losses toward the end of the day, trading above $53,500 at last check.  So far in 2021, bitcoin's average daily price range is $3,765, per market data analyzed by CoinDesk, well below Monday's record range.  Monday's sharp correction and large range was not a surprise to some analysts. ""The market hasn't seen a pullback like this since early January. With this level of leverage in the system, many had considered it to be overdue,"" said Coin Metrics data scientist Jon Geenty in a private message with CoinDesk.  ""This move can largely be attributed to record open interest in the futures markets and the liquidation that tend to follow,"" Geenty told CoinDesk.  Before Monday's correction, FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried described the cryptocurrency market as ""massively over-leveraged"" in an interview with The Block.  Year to date, bitcoin has gained 83%, continuing its more than 300% rally in 2020.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/22/bitcoin-trades-in-record-11k-daily-range-after-dropping-from-58k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8cf00c120e15a54367c69237ebd48c5e03ff6a62-1008x674.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Square’s 4,709 bitcoins were worth $50 million when the company announced the purchase in October 2020. Now that BTC is worth a whopping $253 million.      Along with MicroStrategy, Jack Dorsey's Square was an early entrant in the corporate bitcoin sweepstakes. Such treasury management plays inspired Elon Musk’s Tesla to invest $1.5 billion in bitcoin earlier this month.

His own estimate is $2.2 billion, a $600 million increase from Square’s third-quarter bitcoin transaction revenue.      In the third quarter of 2020, Square reported $1.63 billion in bitcoin revenue, which resulted in $32 million of gross profit from the bitcoin product in that quarter.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/02/22/squares-50m-bitcoin-buy-is-now-worth-253m,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/22598b3095519118145e16649de459ab7090b682-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433675,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP0TTh,1614033694,Wait Till You Hear the Latest Bitcoin Movie Plot,"The U.S. government has discovered the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto. They label him as a terrorist, they capture him and they ask him to help them control Bitcoin. Nakamoto refuses. So he’s water-boarded until he relents but, unbeknownst to the government, Satoshi is playing his own long con … and is he even the real Satoshi Nakamoto?      Such is the premise of ""Decrypted,"" a British dark comedy that just finished production. It sounds like a conventional thriller until you learn that Satoshi is a gay masochist who gets off on the torture, his girlfriend is trans and they argue with someone writer Mick Sands describes as a “raging racist.” Sands admits that “I’m definitely being provocative.”      With the possible exception of documentaries, films about blockchain have been, at best, “mixed.” No one seems to be clamoring for the return of Kurt Russell in ""Crypto 2."" (Crypto 2: Factor Authentication). But one is bound to succeed at some point, right? Crypto’s raw material is gold. There’s plenty of money. And there’s a built-in audience. Maybe ""Decrypted"" will be the breakout? (At the time of publication, press screeners were unavailable.)      Then there’s the larger industry question. For years, many have looked to blockchain technology as a way to revolutionize the film industry, just as they have looked for blockchain to revolutionize every industry, from porn to the Catholic Church. ""Decrypted""producer Phil Harris says this is now actually starting to happen, which can help disrupt the “outdated, bloated and often dishonest status quo.”      I spoke with writer Mick Sands and producer Harris to learn more about the torture of Satoshi Nakamoto, what it’s like to fundraise in crypto and how exactly blockchain could revolutionize the film industry.      See also: Jeff Wilser - Bitcoin Bull Run: OGs on Why This One’s Different      Note: Mick Sands was refreshingly – almost charmingly – indifferent to sharing massive spoilers of the movie’s plot, including what appear to be its biggest twists. So if you’re spoiler-phobic, proceed with caution.      CoinDesk: Mick, you made a bold choice in using Satoshi Nakamoto as your main character. Why’d you go that route?      Mick Sands: I just thought it was more interesting to have him as the main guy. And the fact that nobody knows who he is gave me a license to do whatever I want with him, because actually it’s not him. And of course, the [National Security Agency] doesn’t know what he looks like. So, if he could answer the right questions, then they were going to buy it.      Wait, did you just drop a big spoiler? Are you saying that the main character of your film – Satoshi Nakamoto – is not actually Satoshi Nakamoto?      MS: It’s a surprise. It’s a spoiler. The NSA is planning to talk to Satoshi to get a back door into the blockchain, so they can control it. Unbeknownst to them, the guy who’s posing as Satoshi is planning to work them over, to f**k the NSA.      Interesting. What are you trying to say with this movie?      MS: With every film or script that I write, there are at least two ideas that come together. Here there were three. The first is the rise of fake truths and cancel culture, and how everybody is shouting about their rights but without any real discussion. Whatever it was – homophobia, gender identity, racism, sexism, all those things had sort of been made illegal. So nobody is allowed to discuss them anymore.      That was the first thing. Then the other big idea was bitcoin. And I was thinking about the blockchain and the idea that in a way it’s based on honesty. And then the third one was finding out that, according to the American government, Satoshi Nakamoto is a terrorist. He's designated as a terrorist. So I started to research what the [Central Intelligence Agency] or the NSA had been up to with regards to crypto. And the NSA has been trying to find a way to control crypto since 2013.      See also: Author Ben Mezrich on Capturing the Winklevii and Plans for a ‘Bitcoin Billionaires’ Movie      How do these themes tie together, especially with crypto and Satoshi?      MS: So, one of the NSA guys is a homophobe and a sexist. His partner, a woman, is a feminist. And Satoshi’s girlfriend is transgender. So I thought that if Satoshi is her boyfriend, then he's got to be at least gay. So he's gay. And then also the other idea – which I thought was funny at the start because I knew he was going to get waterboarded – is that he’s a masochist as well. So he gets a little bit turned on by the stuff, the homophobe beating him up and waterboarding him.      You’re definitely leaning into some hot button issues…      MS: Oh, yeah, yeah. So I'm definitely being provocative. But what I was careful to do, so I don't get hanged, is that I've argued and given reasons for every different person. There’s a guy who's open-hearted and believes that we should take all the borders down. And Satoshi and his girlfriend are crypto-anarchists, so they have a point of view. Everybody gets to air their view, which is really my point. We should all try and be a bit more honest and listen to other people.      What do you want the crypto-community to take away from this film?      MS: The guy who's pretending to be Satoshi, and his girlfriend – they’re representatives of the crypto world. And really, they win.      Another spoiler!      MS: And so I hope the crypto community will think it’s fun and a positive endorsement of crypto, partly because it's based on honesty.      Phil, you’ve referred to a “blockchain revolution” in the film industry. What’s the advantage, exactly, of blockchain in film?      Phil Harris [producer]: It’s disrupting the current bloated, often dishonest status quo of the film industry. There's a lot of transparency and efficiency with blockchain which is missing at the moment, essentially with the sales agents and distributors. They give you reports, and it’s very difficult to know how accurate the numbers are.      How so?      PH: When you’re a producer, a sales agent will represent your film, say, to various distributors globally, and you get a quarterly report of where it's being sold, how much money has been made on video-on-demand platforms, and so on. But you have to accept their numbers unless you can afford an audit.      As a small independent company making low-budget films, an audit is expensive. So you have to rely on what people are saying. But with the blockchain, obviously it's transparent and you can collect revenue automatically in real time every time someone downloads the film. It goes to all the relevant parties directly, straight away. Everyone can see what's going on. So that in itself is a breath of fresh air.      There’s been a lot of hype, but what platforms that actually exist – and are up and running – do you see have real merit?      PH: So you’ve got video-on-demand platform Cinezen and MoviesChain, and you've got companies like Vuulr – they launched an [initial coin offering] years ago that I was interested in. They provide a service on the blockchain where you can present your film directly to the buyers, which might be a TV channel or a video-on-demand platform, without having to go through sales agents or distributors.      Beyond the accuracy of reports, what’s the problem with the current sales agent system?      PH: I mean, these sales markets are very outdated. People used to take wheels of films around the world to these big markets and people would watch them in cinemas. Now you can just send links to screeners. So, Vuulr cuts out the middleman. You go direct to the buyers, and then you can do contracts online, and actually make a deal within a few days. And then you've got FilmChain, which collects revenue and automatically distributes payments to all the participants invested in the film.      You mentioned the “middleman.” Whom are you talking about exactly?      PH: The fat cats that have been in the industry for a very long time. It's the old system where they'd all meet up four times a year around the world and sell films to each other, which you had to do physically. They’re hanging onto that old model.      It's the people in the middle who seem to make an awful lot of money, but we're the ones putting in all the hard work and we're the creatives. So, the same old story. Our profit margins are squeezed for the luxury of someone jetting around the world selling our film.      We really don't need to do that now. If I had access to all the buyers of the world and they had access to me we wouldn't need the sales agents and the distributors. And that is basically what Vuulr and FilmChain are doing. So everyone invested in my film knows that each time a payment is made, they would automatically directly get divided up and allocated to everybody contracted.      See also: Mark Cuban on Bitcoin, NFTs and What Comes Next: ‘The Upside Is Truly Unlimited’      In theory, this is all very cool. But obviously it’s not yet super mainstream. What do you think has held it back from broader adoption, and what needs to happen for it to get more mainstream?      PH: It’s a good question. Well, first of all, I think the only people interested in it are people who are interested in cryptocurrency. So that does narrow it down. But I think the more people get involved with crypto, the more that'll open up to a wider market. And also, FilmChain and Vuulr use blockchain technology, but they don't particularly use cryptocurrencies, so they've blown into the wider market.      Some of these video-on-demand platforms use crypto payments, and for them, it’s only really people who love films and love crypto. It’s early days. But if crypto blows, then I think these services will blow as well, because it's just another way that you're paying for stuff using crypto.      And you financed the film in crypto, right? How’d that work?      PH: We raised about three-quarters of the funds in bitcoin. We thought about launching an ICO to raise funds. But, luckily, I know a successful crypto trader, and he loved the film idea. He went to his crypto chums, and they invested the money in bitcoin for our film, so we didn't actually have to launch an ICO.      These are good chums! And then what’d you do with the BTC?      PH: We had to convert it to fiat to pay for everything. It would be lovely in a future where people can accept cryptocurrency for services, and it’d be great if we can pay content creators dividends in cryptocurrency. But this is all stuff for the future, when it becomes a little bit more widely used, and when cryptocurrency as a whole expands.      To the future! Best of luck with the film.

42433679,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP0Tdh,1614029499,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Stabilizes After Margin Calls Fuel Biggest Plunge in Month,"Bitcoin (BTC) price plunged as much as 19% in a violent sell-off Monday, the biggest of the year in dollar terms with a loss of more than $10,000, before quickly recovering and settling around $54,000.    Bitcoin trading around $53,884.35 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 6.45% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $47,780.75-$47,943.85 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC trades between its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a sideways signal for market technicians.    The day’s price swings came on strong volume across major exchanges Bitfinex, Bitflyer, Bitstamp, Coinbase, Gemini, ItBit, Kraken and Poloniex. The volume spiked to above $8 billion, the highest levels in almost two weeks. For comparison, the figure was about $5.8 billion on Friday.      As CoinDesk reported earlier, blockchain data showed billions of dollars of bitcoin being transferred onto exchanges on Sunday, as this year’s doubling in prices to levels above $58,000 apparently motivated some traders to take profits.      Most of these bitcoin exchange inflows went to the U.S.-based Gemini, according to blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant, indicating that the correction could be mostly led by investors and traders in the U.S.      Another indicator provided by CryptoQuant, the “Coinbase premium,” which tracks the gap between Coinbase Pro’s BTC/USD pair and Binance’s BTC/USDT pair involving the tether stablecoin, also went negative during early trading U.S. trading hours on Monday – seen as a sign of lackluster institutional demand.      Some analysts and traders were optimistic that prices would recover quickly, and that the correction might have been healthy for the market after it ran up too far, too fast.      Monday’s sell-off “is without a doubt the result of overly confident traders with unsustainable leverage,” Bendik Norheim Schei, head of research at Arcane Research, told CoinDesk. “It’s been brewing for some time, as the premiums on futures have been very high lately. The dump and the liquidations of leverage traders today were necessary and healthy for the market.”      Speaking with CoinDesk last week, analysts and traders had warned that bitcoin might face more volatility due to an over-leveraged market, where the average “funding rate” on bitcoin perpetuals – a fee that traders pay for leverage embedded within the derivatives contracts – has risen sharply across major exchanges, to a level not seen since February 2020.      The market turned extremely bullish last week after electric vehicle maker Tesla announced its $1.5 billion bitcoin investment, so it’s not surprising that a correction followed the steep run-up, said Hunain Naseer, senior editor at OKEx Insights.      “For now, even with the price bouncing back, the market is not in an uptrend, and bitcoin needs to consolidate and reclaim $55,000 levels,” Naseer added.    Ether drops more sharply, more than $25M in DeFi loans liquidated    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down Monday, trading around $1,768.24 and sliding 8.32% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Compared with bitcoin, ether’s reaction to Monday’s sell-off was more severe, coming just days after it logged a new all-time high above $2,000 on Friday.      “With ether trading one step behind bitcoin, the weakness has spread here to a higher degree following the failed break of $2,000 over the weekend,” Singapore-based quant firm QCP Capital wrote in its Telegram channel on Monday.      Ether’s currently testing at a key supporting level around $1,700, as noted by QCP. If that fails, the next support level would be at $1,470.      While ether continues plummeting, the gas fees on Ethereum blockchain also reached record highs on Monday, according to data from Blockchair.      High gas fees are also likely a contributor to a $25 million worth of liquidation on decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platforms, as CoinDesk reported.

42405947,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAepXvV,1614026331,Nigeria's Crypto Ban Fuels Mistrust in Government,"Nigeria is committed to building its digital economy, but the central bank’s recent cryptocurrency prohibition counteracts this goal and fuels mistrust of the government.      ""Governments and businesses all over the world are realizing the powerful potential usability of blockchain. ... Nigeria, however, is lagging due to the government institutions' sore-footedness and refractory approach to this undeniably ingenious innovation.""    Hannah Akuiyibo is an Associate at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, D.C    So states the draft National Blockchain Adoption Strategy released by Nigeria's National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) in October. The strategy makes the case for Nigeria's adoption of blockchain technology, including digital currencies, to build a digital economy.      Yet, on Feb. 5, many Nigerians were surprised and angered when the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) announced a ban on the exchange of cryptocurrency by financial institutions and directed banks to close accounts trading in crypto.    Although CBN said its policy is a reiteration of a 2017 circular warning financial institutions about virtual currencies' risks, this announcement is at odds with its efforts toward digital transformation. Following the announcement, the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) paused its regulatory review of crypto pending CBN clarification. Meanwhile, the Senate has invitedhttps://von.gov.ng/2021/02/11/ban-on-crypto-currency-senate-invites-cbn-and-sec-chiefs/ the heads of CBN and the SEC to brief them on this decision.    See also: Nigeria’s SEC Puts Plans to Regulate Crypto on Hold in Light of Central Bank Ban      As oil prices tumbled in 2020, taking Nigeria's forex reserves and the value of the naira with them, Nigeria entered a recession, and inflation stood at nearly 16% as of December. CBN has pursued several avenues for increasing forex liquidity in Nigeria, including requiring International Money Transfer Operators to distribute remittances in U.S. dollars instead of naira, cracking down on exporters who do not repatriate revenue, and restricting the use of forex for some imports.      Restrictions on foreign spending have led some banks to limit monthly foreign transactions to as low as $100 a month. Direct remittances to Nigeria also dropped over 97% between January and September 2020, increasing the squeeze on forex.      CBN devalued the naira twice last year, and the high cost of moving money into Nigeria has led Nigerians to seek alternatives through cryptocurrency. Nigeria is the world's second-largest peer-to-peer (P2P) bitcoin market and the largest in Africa. Crypto trading, which totaled $566 million from 2015-2020, has increased yearly since 2015, with a jump of 30% in 2020.    The high cost of moving money into Nigeria has led Nigerians to seek alternatives through cryptocurrency.    Driving the crypto market's growth is users tapping into crypto as a payment, investment, and trading tool amid increasing difficulties in accessing forex and the desire to hedge the value of funds. While the COVID-19 pandemic likely plays a significant role in the remittance decline, members of the diaspora are increasingly turning to cryptocurrency to send money and avoid stiff fees and the high CBN exchange rate that reduces the value of the exchange by up to 20-30%.      The crypto exchange platform, Yellow Card, reported growth of 1,840% in remittances processed on its platform in 2020, with Nigeria making up more than 50% of its users. This increase in cryptocurrency usage tracks with the overall growth of Nigeria's Fintech sector.    Nigeria's digital transformation    In Nigeria, the government has made concerted efforts toward streamlining and developing policy frameworks and national strategies to advance its digital transformation. President Buhari redesignated the Ministry of Communications as the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy (FMoCDE) in 2019 and moved the National Identity Management Commission to this ministry.    Last year, FMoCDE released the eight pillar Digital Economy Policy and Strategy 2020-2030 and subsequently launched a Digital Nigeriahttps://www.digitalnigeria.gov.ng/acfe/ skills development platform. In support of the digital strategy, the NITDA released the draft National Adoption Blockchain Strategy, and in September 2020, the SEC released its position confirming cryptocurrency as a security. As recently as January 2021, the CBN announced its regulatory fintech sandbox framework.  Crypto ban    In light of Nigeria's efforts to advance its digital economy agenda, the crypto decision seems counterproductive and reactive. While the crypto ban has led to an initial chill, with banks closing accounts and some owners withdrawing their funds, it is unlikely to impact crypto's growth.      Instead, users may move to P2P trading platforms that facilitate trading without an intermediary and allow non-fiat payment methods. Already, there has been an almost 16% jump in bitcoin usage for P2P lending since the announcement, and Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange platform, recently introduced a new P2P option for Nigerians. Many Nigerians have attributed the decision to the CBN's urgent need to inject and retain forex in the economy by any means. But if the goal was to increase forex or promote transparency, pushing users to P2P platforms undermines these aims.      See also: Nigerian Banks Shut Them Out, so These Activists Are Using Bitcoin to Battle Police Brutality      Trust in government institutions has also taken a hit. Some view this as bureaucratic stifling of innovation or a desire to increase control and cut off a means of livelihood for many young Nigerians facing a projected unemployment rate of over 30% in 2021. The frustration expressed by Nigerians taps into a broader dissatisfaction with a government perceived as corrupt and non-responsive. The lack of public or industry consultation or policy coordination has reinforced this viewpoint, and Nigerians on Twitter launched a #WeWantOurCryptoBack campaign.      Others noted that political influence could be driving the decision after some #EndSARS protestors turned to cryptocurrency to raise funds when the government froze their bank accounts. CBN explained the decision by the need to protect consumers and counter the use of cryptocurrencies for criminal activities while emphasizing that the decision does not detract from the bank's commitment to developing the fintech sector.      Enhanced policy coordination and consultation with the industry and users will be critical for the government to build trust, instill investor confidence, gain public buy-in and push forward digital transformation.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Hannah Akuiyibo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/02/22/nigerias-crypto-ban-fuels-mistrust-in-government,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/34147c51d46716e8beb88de006ea97f54dc3aaa4-1420x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405943,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAepXsY,1614025940,Brave Browser Was Exposing Addresses in Tor Mode for Months,"The Brave browser, which emphasizes privacy and security, has been leaking data for months, according to security researchers.      On Friday, Reddit user “py4YQFdYkKhBK690mZql” posted on a forum that Brave’s Tor mode, introduced in 2018, was sending requests for .onion domains to DNS resolvers, rather than private Tor nodes. A DNS resolver is a server that converts domain names into IP addresses. This means the .onion sites people searched for, with the understanding those searches would be private, were not. In fact, they could be observed by centralized internet service providers (ISPs).      Various privacy and security subreddit moderators refused to accept the post initially because they wanted more vetting of the claims.      ""It was discovered by my partner on my startup, as we're working on an ad and ‘BS’ blocking VPN service (as well as other things, as shown on the site),” said py4YQFdYkKhBK690mZql in a direct message to CoinDesk. “He mentioned noting it while observing his outbound DNS traffic on his local network.""    Read more: How a Lawsuit Against the IRS Is Trying to Expand Privacy for Crypto Users    The findings were quickly confirmed by security researchers on Twitter. Following this, Brave confirmed it was aware of the issue, and pushed a security patch to the browser Friday evening.      The leaks had been ongoing for months before Brave became aware of them, said Sean O’Brien, principal researcher at ExpressVPN Digital Security Lab, who conducted further research into the vulnerability and shared it exclusively with CoinDesk. Not only were .onion domain requests observable but so were all domain requests in Tor tabs, meaning that when a website loaded content from YouTube, Google or Facebook, all of those requests could be observable, even if the content itself was not.      “An update to adblocking in Brave browser introduced a vulnerability that exposed users of the browser's most private feature – Tor windows and tabs,” said O’Brien. “Users of this Tor feature in Brave expected to have the websites they visit hidden to their ISPs, schools and employers, but that domain information (DNS traffic) was instead revealed.    DNS leaks and Brave’s vulnerability timeline    A DNS leak creates a trail in server logs that can be followed by law enforcement, hackers or really anyone that has high-level network access. Tor is a browser that enables anonymous communication by directing internet traffic through a large overlay network, which conceals a user's location and protects against network surveillance or traffic analysis. Privacy advocates such as Edward Snowden and others have advocated for Tor as a valuable tool for protecting against surveillance.      Those using the Tor mode service in the Brave browser expect their traffic to be protected against exactly the sort of DNS server logs that occurred as a result of this leak, which could reveal what websites they are accessing.      “Fundamentally, your ISP would know if you had visited .onion websites and if they track a log of all the websites you visited, they might report you as ‘suspicious,’” said pseudonymous security researcher SerHack in a direct message.      The Tor Project, makers of the Tor browser, declined to comment for this piece.      “Brave warns users that Tor windows and tabs in its browser do not provide the same level of privacy as Tor Browser, which is developed directly by the Tor Project,” said O’Brien. “However, this DNS leak was properly described as ‘egregious’ by Brave's CSO.”    Read more: Popular Crypto App Found to Have Ties to Data Tracking Company    O’Brien examined each build of the Brave browser dating back to its launch in late 2019.      In doing so, he found the DNS leakage first showed up in a patch for ""Support CNAME adblocking #11712,"" which was introduced to the browser source code on Oct. 14, 2020. It was included in the Brave browser nightly build that same day.      The Brave browser has two versions – a nightly build that is for developers and a stable build that is for ordinary users. Changes made in the nightly build are tested and then eventually incorporated into the stable build.      Brave released the update containing the DNS leakage vulnerability to the browser’s stable build on Nov. 20, 2020.      The vulnerability was not reported until Jan. 12, 2021, according to Github, via HackerOne. Brave released a fix for it in the nightly build on Feb. 4, but until py4YQFdYkKhBK690mZq publicized the issue on Reddit and it was confirmed by other researchers, Brave hadn’t issued a fix to the stable build.    Read more: Brave Becomes First Browser to Offer Native IPFS Integration    Brave pushed the stable build fix on Friday evening, the same day reports of the problem were made public. CoinDesk has confirmed that the stable build of Brave is no longer leaking information to DNS servers.      This means that for months users who were using the Tor mode with the understanding their traffic was private were, in fact, having it logged in DNS servers, leaving behind a trail of their online activity. The stable build was fixed two weeks after the nightly build.      Overall, the nightly Brave build was leaking for 113 days, while the stable build was doing so for 91 days.      “This entire thing is such a scary incident for people [who] want to protect their privacy,” said SerHack. “It seems Brave did not pay attention to all details, and this episode should warn us that a single mistake might nullify all the efforts on privacy.”    Brave’s response    In response to questions about how long this had been an issue, what the implications for users were and how Brave could ensure something like this doesn't happen in the future, Sydney Huffman, a spokesperson for Brave, issued the following statement:      “In mid-January 2021, we were made aware of a bug that would allow a network attacker to see DNS requests that were made in a private window in Brave with Tor connectivity. The root cause was a new adblocking feature called CNAME adblocking which initiated DNS requests that did not go through Tor in order to check if a domain should be blocked.      ""This bug was discovered and reported by xiaoyinl on HackerOne. We responded immediately to the report and included a fix for this vulnerability in the February 4, 2021, nightly update (https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/7769). As is our usual process for bug fixes, we have been testing the changes in nightly to make sure that they didn't cause regressions or other bugs before releasing to the stable channel.”    Read more: This Elusive Malware Has Been Targeting Crypto Wallets for a Year    Huffman added that given the severity of the issue and the fact that it was now public (thereby making it easier to exploit), the company accelerated the timeline for this issue and released it Friday.      She also noted that using a private window with Tor connectivity through Brave is not the same as using Tor Browser.      “If your personal safety depends on remaining anonymous, we highly recommend using Tor Browser instead of Brave Tor windows,” she said.      While the recognition and quick fix for the issue was a positive end result, instances such as these serve as a reminder of the multitude of ways that privacy can be compromised online, even when users think they’re taking steps to be secure.      The high level of anonymity that Tor can provide was broken, and this vulnerability might have allowed network intermediaries or attackers to snoop on users and track what websites they visit, according to O’Brien.      “The good news is that the content that traveled across the network, such as conversations or files, seems to have been protected by Tor,” he said. “Users in dangerous situations, however, could have been put at risk, especially if they acted with less caution because they expected anonymity.”",NEGATIVE,없음,MARKET | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/22/brave-browser-was-exposing-addresses-in-tor-mode-for-months,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6903cf4bf355eb78b76a81a764d0ce9cffc4adc1-1102x808.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The bank said earlier this month it was working with outside partners on the crypto custody play but did not identify them.      With bitcoin edging its way onto Wall Street, big institutions are looking for ways to accelerate their offerings, creating a bit of gold rush for crypto-native service providers.      Banks in Europe have announced partnerships with crypto custody specialists like Switzerland’s Metaco. BNY Mellon is taking a similar approach in working with multi-party computation shop Fireblocks.      It’s worth noting that BNY Mellon also has a long-standing partnership with Bakkt, the crypto trading platform owned by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).      Fireblocks and BNY Mellon declined to comment.      “Fireblocks has been working with BNY Mellon for a long time,” said a source.

42405961,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAepY7J,1614015161,"Bitcoin Drops, DeFi Loans Liquidated, NFTs Sell","Market intel  The pullback    Bitcoin tumbled below $50,000, before bouncing back this morning. This follows exuberant trading yesterday, which saw the cryptocurrency claw to a fresh high of $58,332 during early Asian hours.      How deep will it go? According to David Lifchitz, CIO for Paris-based quantitative trading firm ExoAlpha, a 15% correction isn’t out of the question. “$50,000 looks like the first stop for a mild pullback, but a second leg down could take it down to $40,000, while the $30,000 zone looks like the ultimate bottom should things turn ugly in the short term,” Lifchitz said.      It’s not just tea leaves, there are macroeconomic forces that might explain this recent price action. CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole notes that U.S. inflation-adjusted bond yields are rising, with the real yield turning positive for the first time since June 2020. This supports a bullish case for the U.S. dollar – as investors de-risk and put money in U.S. Treasury bonds when yields rise – and a bearish case for gambles like bitcoin and stocks.      Speaking of, according to a new survey, 41% of U.S. investors think stocks and crypto are equally risky. One JPMorgan analyst might disagree. In a recent investor note the banker wrote that market liquidity in hedges like bitcoin and gold is “much lower” than in stocks, meaning that “even small flows can have a large price impact.”    Sound bites    This morning on ""First Mover,"" Muneeb Ali dug into the cultural differences between the traditional tech industry and crypto. The prevailing attitude in Silicon Valley, he argued, is constant iteration, perhaps best exemplified by the ""move fast and break things"" mantra.      Bitcoin is different. ""Bitcoin doesn't change. Bitcoin is valuable because it is durable, because it is hard to modify,"" Ali said. Watch the full interview here.    Top shelf    Putting the fun in nonfungible NFTs are getting ridiculous. Yesterday, a batch of CryptoPunks, sometimes called the “rookie card” of digital collectibles, sold for around $1 million in ETH. Apparently a single buyer made the purchase. This follows news from Friday that a tokenized version of “Nyan Cat,” a classic internet meme, sold for 300 ETH ($527,000). Chris Torres, creator of the meme and nonfungible token, said the sale “opened the door to a whole new meme economy.” Sounds strange, but here’s Ben Roy’s “fat CryptoPunk thesis.”      Regulator opinions Former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has joined Stripe as a board member. Carney has been an advocate for the digital economy and a potential cryptographic replacement to the U.S. dollar, which he sees as a victim of a multipolar world. Carney is unique among regulators for not completely bashing libra (now diem) when first announced – even saying a private, “synthetic” currency could become the global reserve.    Still, not all regulators are aligned. Sweden’s financial watchdog warned that investments such as bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) may be unsuitable for retail consumers. Even the Washington Post editorial board thinks bitcoin’s rise is cause for alarm.    Digital yuan MYbank and WeBank – institutions backed by Chinese giants Ant Group and Tencent, respectively – are reportedly set to join the ongoing trial of the digital yuan. Digital wallets from the two private banks will be added to the People's Bank of China’s digital yuan app alongside those from the six state-owned banks already participating. If and when it is launched, the digital yuan would be the first national digital currency from a major country. Meanwhile, Morocco’s central bank is reportedly looking into CBDCs.      Institutional interest The North American bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) market launched last week, with two products gaining approval and quickly surpassing expectations. The first of which brought in $421.8 million in assets in just two days trading, including over 6,000 BTC. There are now many proposals for competing bitcoin ETFs, including one from Canadian asset manager Global Asset Management and merchant bank Galaxy Digital.    Institutional attention isn’t just on bitcoin. CoinShares is launching a token that tracks the decentralized finance (DeFi) market subsector.

The price of bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, tumbled 7.6% to about $52,800. It was the biggest decline in a month and trimmed the year-to-date gain to about 83%.      Some 40,000 BTC ($2.1 billion worth) have been transferred to exchanges since Friday on major crypto exchanges, pushing up the bitcoin reserves to levels not seen since the end of January, according to data from blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.      Ki Young Ju, CEO of South Korea-based crypto data firm CryptoQuant, told CoinDesk the bitcoin inflow mostly went to the U.S-based Gemini, which saw some 34,000 BTC come in before Monday’s market sell-off.      The blockchain data appear to show a flow of about 28,000 BTC to Gemini around 2 p.m. New York time (19:00 UTC) on Sunday, right around the time the cryptocurrency’s price reached the $58,000 level, according to CryptoQuant.      Monday’s price slide coincided with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s comments at the New York Times’ DealBook DC Policy Project that bitcoin is not widely used as a “transaction mechanism.”      The cryptocurrency represents an “extremely inefficient way” of conducting transactions, Yellen said, and “the amount of energy that’s consumed in processing those transactions is staggering.”      If bitcoin breaks below $50,000, it might then fall to a range of $40,000 to $42,000 before finding a new technical support level on price charts, Singapore-based QCP Capital said Monday on its Telegram broadcast channel.      “We have $54,000 as the first trendline support, a break of which will take us to $50,000, which is the stronger second trend-line support,” QCP Capital wrote. “Forced retail liquidations could take us to test the $40,000-$42,000, which is the hedge fund trading level corresponding to the parabolic trendline.”      “The $40,000 level needs to hold “to preserve the strong bullish momentum,” QCP added.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/22/bitcoin-transfers-worth-billions-could-mean-more-selling-pressure,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3882679740784ff25ac60def06ca45f8d8f050a8-1200x599.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405950,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAepXwU,1614010803,How to Win a Bitcoin Street Fight (Without Mortal Combat),"In old gaming arcades there used to be two fighting games competing for attention. One was Street Fighter, and the other Mortal Kombat. You could choose which one to play, but once you picked a console, you didn’t get to use characters from one to battle in the other.      I am reminded of this every time I end up in a bitcoin debate.    Brett Scott is the author of ""The Heretic’s Guide to Global Finance."" His forthcoming book on the war on cash and the dynamics of digital money systems will be published in 2022 by Penguin Random House and HarperCollins.    I’ve become a bitcoin critic, and when the price rises, I often find myself drawn into depressing skirmishes with crypto evangelists. They’re depressing because my opponents refuse to pick a game in the arcade.      Some bitcoin enthusiasts are not aware they are doing this, but others are. They are presenting themselves as playing a game, but in reality it’s one that doesn’t even exist, and they are misinforming a generation of idealistic young people in the process. Let me explain and tell you why this really matters.      Imagine bitcoin was originally a character in a game called Money Wars, but due to some dispute there’s now a breakaway game called Titans of Trading, which also features Bitcoin.      In Money Wars, bitcoin is cast as a form of money fighting the forces of fiat currency. Will it triumph against the nefarious Federal Reserve boss-man!      See also: Money Reimagined: Tucker Carlson Is Right About Financial Privacy      In Titans of Trading, bitcoin is cast not as money, but rather as a rising star in the investment asset market, competing against other assets. Will it beat the dollar returns of the stock market!      In both games, you can choose to play as bitcoin, or – alternatively – as a fighter who’s antagonistic or dismissive towards bitcoin. For example, my (anti-bitcoin) character in Money Wars might fight the Fed boss-man, but also think bitcoin is a distracting annoyance they need to get through first.      Thus, in Money Wars I might try to uppercut your bitcoin character by critiquing its deeply conservative monetary ideology.I approach, saying, “Imagine a world in which Bitcoin is money, and everyone requires it to access goods and services.”      Then I crouch low for the attack, and say: “Many people in this world need loans to buy houses or start small businesses, but because bitcoin’s supply is so constrained, its power rises faster than the borrowers can make the income necessary for repayment. The amount of stuff they need to sell to repay a 10 BTC loan gets higher and higher every month.”      Then I unleash the uppercutwith “this leaves the borrowers in ever deeper debt servitude. As money, Bitcoin would be like a form of strangulation that keeps creditors in the system in power!”      Hadouken!    Switching games    In Money Wars, the bitcoin character might block and counterstrike by showcasing the evils of hyperinflation, but in Titans of Trading, the characters change, and so must the critique and defense combos. Here the bitcoin character is an asset on a monetary market, and I might launch a simple jab by saying, “Bitcoin is just a blank digital object held in sophisticated decentralized scaffolding. You’re just pumping it for fickle dollar gains. Why not just buy shares, which are actually anchored into the real economy?!”      Again, you can block and counter-strike by telling me how spectacular the dollar gains are, and how they’ve empowered the early holders. If you’re skilled, you might even make a sophisticated countermove, arguing that due to its movability and dollar price, the object has use for forms of barter-like countertrade. This game is fun, because we agree that your bitcoin character is an object in a market, rather than the money that underpins a market.      It turns out that expecting to play the same game is wishful thinking, because the dominant mode of attack from crypto evangelists is the equivalent of using Mortal Kombat’s Raiden to launch lightning bolts against Street Fighter’s Ryu. They use strengths from their Titans character against weaknesses in a Money Warsopponent.      It’s typical for bitcoiners to whinge about inflation (Money Wars), before using bitcoin’s rising price (Titans) to argue for why it’s a “deflationary currency” (Money Wars), that will be a great savings vehicle (Titans) to empower the unbanked (Money Wars).      OMG, where to start. It’s either an appreciating asset priced in dollars (Titans) or it’s a deflationary currency used to price everything (Money Wars). Pick a game!      Of course, it’s possible that you’ve entered the arcade in a confused state, and are not aware that Money Wars and Titans are different. After all, they feature one common character. Can’t you just combine that character’s powers from both games?      No. The games are contained in separate consoles. The common character cannot jump out of one screen and into the other.    Learning to see the difference    Crypto evangelists cannot recognize the difference between an appreciating asset and a deflationary currency. Why is this?      Well, to clearly see the difference in games, we need to accept that monetary systems underpin market systems, but many people – often under the influence of standard economics – believe market systems underpin monetary systems. If you have this tendency to see money as a “good on a market,” it will become very easy for you to collapse the distinction between money and superficially “money-like” things priced in money.      See also: Emily Parker - Why We Should Take Dogecoin Seriously      We don’t generally make this mistake in a supermarket. Despite the fact that the goods we see there are extremely diverse, they all carry the same $ symbol on their prices. We thus find it easy to distinguish between money and “all the things in the supermarket.” But if a movable digital object like bitcoin appears before you with a dollar price, you are susceptible to placing it in some hybrid category. Because of its branding as a “coin,” you are now prone to simultaneously seeing it as “money” (even though there’s not one country in the world that has supermarkets with BTC pricing in them) and “thing priced in money.”      This is why the bitcoin debates get so absurd. Fully grown adults are arguing that in future all goods will have BTC symbols, but in the meantime they’ll hand over dollars to someone to get it. This is how you simultaneously play Money Wars – in which all goods route through Bitcoin – and Titans, in which Bitcoin gets routed through the dollar system like an item in a supermarket.      For those of you who have been doing this, you can take consolation that a character in Titans might indeed offer forms of protection against a boss-man in Money Wars, but only if you realize that many other Titans characters can, too. Just like you can buy up farmland or rare postage stamps to escape inflation, you can buy bitcoin to do the same.      Bitcoin is not “fighting” the U.S. dollar, though. It’s fighting rare postage stamps for investment dollars, with the side effect that this might create an inflation hedge. This form of inflation hedging, in which you exit money and then re-enter it at a later date, is profoundly different to keeping a form of “deflationary” money that gets ever-more powerful relative to the goods that are routed through it.    Why the game really matters    Let’s now turn to the darkest reason for this refusal to pick a game. All the rhetoric about an anti-inflationary money system that we find in Money Wars is really a fake marketing layer for bitcoin, and is used by its promoters to get attention to help them in their true game, which is Titans.      These promoters are the worst. Bitcoin is really just an asset that fights other assets, but they cynically package it with a messianic backstory about how it’s actually fighting the dollar. They keep bigging up this old story because it makes the crowd cheer. But then bitcoin gets into the ring and starts competing against shares (like GameStop) for investment dollars.    Right now Bitcoin language is like a scramble zone full of chaff designed to disorientate actual debate.    It’s cunning but cowardly because every time someone tries to critique one of these promoters, they can switch games to ""counter"" any attack. I’m in Street Fighter about to uppercut them, but they disappear, reappear in Mortal Kombat, body-slam an unmanned opponent over there, and then reappear waving a victory flag.      They are deliberately spreading a mind-virus, one in which you can defeat the evil fiat boss-man whilst simultaneously raving about your dollar gains. Right now bitcoin language is like a scramble zone full of chaff designed to disorientate actual debate, and far from this being an interesting zone of ambiguity where new realities can emerge, it’s a boring technique of equivocation, in which imprecise language is used to present one thing as another. Unfortunately, this is becoming so common that it’s disorientating a generation of young people, who are failing to learn to Street Fight.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Brett Scott,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/02/22/how-to-win-a-bitcoin-street-fight-without-mortal-combat,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/026d2f320a75ba31a5590ff41d298fb6f512eaf5-1420x987.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

That’s the highest amount in three months since Nov. 25 saw $93 million in liquidations.    Some 57% of liquidations worth $13.6 million came from lending platform Compound, followed by 33.2% on versions one and two of Aave worth an estimated $8 million, according to data provider DeBank.  “This was still a ‘small’ move and we still saw gas spiking to these crazy levels despite Binance disabling all exchange withdrawals,” one market maker who asked to remain unnamed said to CoinDesk. “I wonder what would happen with a move like we had it in March.”  High gas fees are a likely contributor to DeFi liquidations. Gas, denominated in ether, is needed to close out positions so as not to be liquidated. The average transaction fee hit unparalleled record highs Monday at $29 for a basic transaction, according to Blockchair.  DeFi lending platforms enable investors to take out overcollateralized loans.

42405965,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAepY9H,1614004821,First Mover: Laser Eyes Can't Stop Correction as Bitcoin Tumbles to $53K,"Price Point    Bitcoin was falling on Monday, retreating after surpassing a price of $50,000 last week for the first time and soon afterward topping a market capitalization of $1 trillion. Over the weekend, bitcoin surged to a new all-time-high price over $58,000.      As of press time, the largest cryptocurrency was changing hands around $54,000. Price charts appeared to show support levels around $50,700, or $41,800 in a deeper pullback, according to Matt Blom, head of sales and trading for the digital-asset exchange firm EQUOS.      ""The current price trajectory may be weakening,"" said Simon Peters, an analyst with the trading platform eToro.      In traditional markets, investors were gripped by rising U.S. government-bond yields. For 30-year bonds, the ""real yield,"" which subtracts out the inflation rate, turned positive for the first time since June 2020. A continued rise in yields could make the country's bonds more attractive to foreign investors, pushing the U.S. dollar higher and putting selling pressure on risky assets like stocks and bitcoin.      ""Market reflationistas are winning the day as bond yields spike from Australia to the U.S.,"" according to Bloomberg News.      European shares slid and U.S. stock futures pointed to a lower open. Oil and copper prices were higher, and gold strengthened 0.7% to $1,797 an ounce.    Bitcoin Watch    Bitcoin market corrects even as news flow looks bullish      Bitcoin might have further room to fall, according to David Lifchitz, CIO for Paris-based quantitative trading firm ExoAlpha.      “A 15% correction could happen, taking some steam out of the hot market, before reaching new highs,” Lifchitz told CoinDesk. “The more upward parabolic and fast a move, the more fragile it is, so a pullback would be more than welcome.”      A healthy cooling off of the market looks overdue, CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole wrote Monday. Several indicators from price charts are signaling overstretched conditions, including an above-70 reading on the widely tracked relative strength index (RSI).      BITCOIN NEWS ROUNDUP:    Miami Mayor Suarez plans to personally buy bitcoin, ether or dogecoin.  Barclays wealth investment chief says bitcoin is increasingly ""cultist"" and supported by ""magical thinking.""  Even skeptics may need to consider crypto exposure, according to the Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street column.  Citadel CEO Ken Griffin tells CNBC he doesn’t see the ‘economic underpinning’ of cryptocurrencies.  New York Post highlights ""11 glorious homes you can now buy with bitcoin.""  Bitcoin is now more expensive than a kilogram of gold, Decrypt reports.  Bitcoin reaches 10% of gold's market capitalization, according to The Block.  A quarter of U.S. investors own cryptocurrencies, survey finds.  Americans are increasingly bullish on cryptocurrency as bitcoin soars to new records.  Some 10% of private aviation company PrivateFly's annual revenue is now coming from travelers paying with bitcoin.  Canada’s first bitcoin ETF hits $421.8 million in assets under management in two days.  CI global files to issue North America’s third bitcoin ETF.  Bitcoin's price rally might be the most powerful of any major asset over the past half-century, according to Bank of America:  Token Watch    ETHER PASSES $2K: Prices for ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, have pushed past $2,000 for the first time in an extension of this year's powerful bull run. At least three growing areas of demand are fueling the increase in ether’s price, according to CoinDesk's Will Foxley: decentralized finance, known as DeFi, most of which has been built to run on the Ethereum blockchain; the buildup to Ethereum's upcoming ""2.0"" upgrade and the move toward a deposit-like ""staking"" system; and Chicago-based CME's new ether derivatives market. By Monday, though, ether prices were tumbling apparently caught in the downdraft of a crypto market sell-off.      MEOW! A digital token representing a decade-old pixelated feline image known as Nyan Cat fetched a price of 300 ETH ($590,000) in an online auction last week. According to CoinDesk's Daniel Kuhn, ""It wasn’t the .gif file that was sold, which is still reproducible and found everywhere online, but a cryptographic hash of the psychedelic image on the Ethereum blockchain."" It's a purr-fect example of the sudden fascination with these ""non-fungible tokens,"" which typically represent ownership in a unique asset such as digital art, collectibles or video-game skins.      BCH, BSV BECOME COLLATERAL DAMAGE OF BITCOIN'S POPULARITY: The cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin has delisted the cryptocurrencies bitcoin cash (BCH) and bitcoin sv (BSV) to avoid ‘misleading’ new clients, many of whom are looking to buy bitcoin. The exchange’s higher-ups wanted to avoid any confusion that new clients might have between the largest cryptocurrency and the similarly named also-ran tokens, CoinDesk's Colin Harper reported.    Market Moves    U.S. banking giant JPMorgan acknowledges existential threat from digital finance      Crypto journalists who raced last week to digest JPMorgan’s 86-page opus on bitcoin and digital finance invariably homed in on the juiciest part: the potential market shock that could come from any ""issues"" involving the $35 billion stablecoin tether (USDT).      Less salacious but perhaps more significant was what JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, said about the threat facing its own industry: The risk that big established players from traditional finance are falling behind in the rapid shift toward cryptocurrencies and digital finance.      ""Banks have been sleepy,"" according to the report, prepared by no fewer than 35 co-authors, including Global Market Analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou. ""The time is now to fight back.""      The digital-finance startups probably benefit from a ""much lower regulatory burden,"" but the banks are expected to fall back on their own advantages, including trillion-dollar balance sheets, regulatory clout and the backing of the Federal Reserve.      ""Traditional banks could emerge as endgame winners in the digital age of banking due to their advantage from deposit franchise, risk management and regulation,"" according to the report.      How will they catch up? Banks might have to open their wallets to acquire digital-forward competitors, or otherwise ramp up in-house spending on technology.      ""We would not underestimate banks forming tech partnerships to combat share loss, even if relegated to a wholesale model, which could be a boon to the winning bank tech partners of choice,"" the analysts wrote.      The analysis takes it for granted that the banks will be the ones acquiring, not the other way around. And that's not a given, given the rapidly rising value of some advanced crypto players.      The digital exchange Coinbase is reportedly now trading at a valuation of $77 billion or upwards of $100 billion in private share markets, and rival Binance's in-house BNB tokens are worth more than $40 billion after a sevenfold price increase so far this year. The big banks' market value, by comparison, has stagnated or fallen recently. JPMorgan is still far ahead with a $451 billion market value, and Bank of America stands at $297 billion. But Wells Fargo's $157 billion and Citigroup's $137 billion don't look too far out of sight, based on the torrid pace of growth in the crypto industry.      Either way it looks like banks are going to have to pump a lot of money into digital finance to avoid obsolescence, which is probably bullish for the crypto industry in general and especially so for the early entrants.      ""Although the market has fixated on the rally in bitcoin, the real economic and exciting action is in the new battle for digital supremacy between the banks and fintech,"" the analysts wrote.    Opinions and Observations    ARTHUR HAYES RETURNS TO WRITING: ""It’s risky for sure, but if your goal is to speculate your way out of Covid-lockdown-induced boredom, or to augment your declining real wages, crypto can and does generate such outcomes. It also, similar to traditional markets, could morph into a pit where your money and resources are set ablaze,"" BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes wrote in his blog, the first such post since August. He made no mention of the federal charges pending against him.      LASER EYES: The new thing that bitcoin bulls are doing these days is modifying their Twitter profiles so it appears that lasers are coming out of their eyes. Supposedly it is part of a campaign by some investors to stay “laser-focused” on a bitcoin price of $100,000. Those who have added the laser eyes to their profiles or been reported to have done so include Tesla CEO Elon Musk, SkyBridge founder Anthony Scaramucci, CoinShares Chief Strategy Officer Meltem Demirors, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and U.S. Representative Warren Davidson of Ohio, .

The London-based firm best known for its bitcoin exchange-traded product XBT has released its CoinShares Gold and Cryptoassets Index Lite (CGI) token on the Ethereum blockchain. The CGI token was built in cooperation with Index Coop, the team behind the DeFi Pulse Index, and the Imperial College of London, according to documents shared with CoinDesk.      The CGI token consists of two equally weighted ""wrapped"" crypto assets – wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) and wrapped ether (WETH) – and the firm’s wrapped gold token, wDGLD. The index itself, the CGCI, was first released in May 2020.      Indexes bring legitimacy and ease of access to novel asset classes, CoinShares chairman Danny Masters told CoinDesk in an interview. For example, the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index of the mid-2000s introduced institutional investors to the commodities market previously not considered an asset class at all, Masters said.      “When [institutional investors] came to the commodity space, they wanted an index,” Masters said. History is likely to repeat with digital assets, he said.      The index token itself is structured so as to take advantage of the infamous volatility of crypto markets.      The CGI itself uses the Shannon's Demon portfolio methodology which breaks asset holdings into two classes: volatile and non-volatile assets – in this case, crypto and gold.      The portfolio rebalances to the original weights on a set schedule regardless of ups or downs. The methodology has proven to beat passive investment products offered by traditional indexes.      The CGI token follows the release of the DeFi Pulse Index (DPI) in September and Bitwise’s DeFi Index Fund on Feb. 17. That index, unlike CoinShares', tracks a basket of differently weighted DeFi tokens such as AAVE or UNI.

Initially, Argo has agreed to purchase $8 million of Canada-based ePIC’s ""state-of-the-art"" ASICs, with delivery expected in early Q4, 2021. Deliveries for other batches will start on a larger scale in 2022.  “This partnership will not only give Argo priority in accessing the most advanced mining infrastructure available, but it also highlights our reputation within the sector as an innovative and forward-thinking cryptocurrency miner,” said Peter Wall, chief executive of Argo Blockchain.  As it seeks to expand its mining operations, Argo this month signed a non-binding letter of intent with a New York-based firm to acquire 320 acres of land to build a 200-megawatt mining center.

42405962,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAepY6K,1613996057,"Bitcoin Briefly Drops Below $48K as Analysts Say Rally Overdone, Yellen Comments","Bitcoin swiftly lost altitude early on Monday, dropping over 15% to below $50,000 before rebounding somewhat. The downward price movement came after bitcoin reached new record highs above $58,300 over the weekend.      The drop seemed to accelerate as U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, speaking at a New York Times event, described bitcoin as ""highly speculative asset"" that is extremely inefficient for transactions. Yellen also called the amount of energy consumed in processing those transactions ""staggering.""      The entire market followed bitcoin's drop. Ether is down nearly 10% over the past 24 hours, trading at $1,770 after falling to $1,546, according to the CoinDesk price index. On Kraken, ether dropped to $700, a 64% crash. The decentralized finance sector of assets is down nearly 8%, per data from Messari.      Bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency by market value, rebounded to above $53,000 as of 15:12 UTC, representing a roughly 7% drop over 24 hours, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      The pullback could be extended further, as the recent rally looked overstretched, according to David Lifchitz, CIO for Paris-based quantitative trading firm ExoAlpha.      ""A 15% correction could happen, taking some steam out of the hot market, before reaching new highs,"" Lifchitz told CoinDesk. ""The more upward parabolic and fast a move, the more fragile it is, so a pullback would be more than welcome.""      Indeed, bitcoin has seen a staggering price rally over the past four months, rising from $10,000 to nearly $60,000, with just one bull market correction in the second half of January.      The recent rise from $30,000 to $58,000 was even steeper, so a healthy cooling off of the market looks overdue – more so, as several technical analysis tools, including the widely tracked relative strength index (RSI), are signaling overstretched conditions with an above-70 reading.      ""Technical indicators such as the RSI and Stochastics across numerous chart timeframes are indicating that the crypto asset is overbought, implying that we could soon see a retracement,"" Simon Peters, an analyst at eToro, said in an email.      Peters also pointed to a bearish divergence on the technical chart, while warning of weakening upward momentum and potential for trend reversal that could see prices fall.      The MACD histogram, an indicator used to gauge trend strength and trend changes, has produced lower highs, contradicting higher highs on the price chart, confirming the bearish divergence.    Macro factors    Supporting the case for a price pullback are rising U.S. inflation-adjusted bond yields, as discussed last week.      The 30-year inflation-adjusted yield, or real yield, has turned positive for the first time since June 2020, and the 10-year real yield has risen to -0.80% from lows near -1.05% observed last month, according to data provided by the U.S. Treasury.      A continued rise in yields could push the U.S. dollar higher, putting selling pressure on equities and bitcoin. Stock markets are trading down at press time, with the S&P 500 futures nursing a 0.6% drop on the day.    How low might bitcoin go?    ""The pullback can easily extend to the former resistance-turned-support near $42,000,"" Joel Kruger, currency strategist at LMAX Digital, told CoinDesk. Markets typically shake out weak bulls with a drop to former hurdle-turned-support levels before extending bull runs.      Bitcoin turned lower from its then-record high of $41,962 on Jan. 8, establishing that level as crucial resistance and slipped to $30,000 in the following days. The newfound resistance was a scaled on Feb. 8 after electric maker Tesla announced its $1.5 billion bitcoin purchase.      Crypto analysts expect other corporates to emulate Tesla's decision to buy bitcoin. However, they may look to invest on price pullbacks, according to Lifchitz.      ""$50,000 looks like the first stop for a mild pullback, but a second leg down could take it down to $40,000, while the $30,000 zone looks like the ultimate bottom should things turn ugly in the short term,"" Lifchitz said.      However, Patrick Heusser, head of trading at Swiss-based Crypto Finance AG, said $52,000 is major support, adding that a significant correction may remain elusive, as the derivatives market is no longer exhibiting excess bullishness.      Also read: Bitcoin Faces Price Turbulence as Market Liquidity Falls, Says JPMorgan      Bitcoin's average funding rate, or the cost of holding long positions in the perpetual futures listed on major exchanges, declined (normalized) below 0.08% early today, having peaked at multi-month highs above 0.12% last week, according to Glassnode data.      While analysts stand divided on possible magnitude of an impending correction, they expect the cryptocurrency to eventually go on to achieve new record highs above $60,000.      ""We believe markets are displaying a healthy correction,"" Dibb said. ""Both BTC and ETH are still trading within an upward channel, and momentum is still skewed towards the bids.""

""Market liquidity is currently much lower for bitcoin than in gold or the S&P 500, which implies that even small flows can have a large price impact,"" bitcoin's falling market liquidity – how much is available for trades – makes it prone to wild price swings, JPMorgan's Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note on Friday, as reported by Bloomberg.      While bitcoin has rallied by over 300% since mid-October, the number of coins held in exchange addresses has declined by 6.6% to 2.38 million, according to Glassnode data. This sell-side liquidity shortage has been exacerbated by strong institutional demand, allowing the steep price rally to record highs over $58,000 Sunday.      The low liquidity is also evident from bitcoin's average daily spot and futures market volume of $10 billion, which is just 10% of gold's $100 billion, according to Panigirtzoglou.
