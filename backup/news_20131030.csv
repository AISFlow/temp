42425088,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHqwHh,1383175284,Malware gang steals $1.4 Million and sets up bitcoin exchange to launder it,"Last week, four men were arrested in the Netherlands for spreading a type of malware that allowed them to obtain Dutch bank account information. And they used a bitcoin exchange to launder some of $1.4 million that was stolen from approximately 150 bank accounts.  The malware, known as TorRAT, targeted only Dutch speakers. TorRAT used the anonymizing network Tor to use its command and control (C&C) servers. The men also paid for a Turkish crypting service to circumvent antivirus software and utilized the hosted tormail.org in order to communicate.  Once the malicious software was able to obtain financial information from its victims, the four suspects would then steal money from the bank accounts. They then used a bitcoin exchange that they set up called FBTC Exchange in order to launder some of the stolen cash into euros.  According to the Bitcoin Wiki, FBTC Exchange was launched on June 25, 2013. The site is no longer in operation, and trading has been halted since October 21. The past 6-month volume on FBTC Exchange was 9,007.55 BTC or €743,792.67, according to Bitcoin Charts.  The police reportedly seized 56 bitcoins from the men, and they were able to exchange them for more than €7,700, or $10,000.  The men were arrested by the Dutch National High Tech Crime Unit (NHTCU). InformationWeek reports that it is possible the men were uncovered by the FBI during its investigation of Silk Road mastermind Ross Ulbricht.  And much like Tor enabled the accused Dutch thieves, Silk Road also relied on the anonymous network in order to hide its users' identities and enable illegal activity. The FBI has reportedly seized hundreds of thousands of bitcoins from bitcoin wallets owned by Ulbricht, a 29-year-old graduate student who was operating Silk Road from a residence in San Francisco.  The stated plan an FBI spokesperson told Forbes is to sell the seized bitcoins, which eventually would dump a large number of bitcoins back on the market. Yet it's questionable whether the feds currently have the access they need to sell them.  It was ultimately the reliance on third parties that likely got the TorRAT suspects arrested, according to Trend Micro.  ""Buying a service from a crypting service, using tormail.org, and recruiting and abusing money mules puts cybercriminals at risk of getting caught. A single error can lead to the unraveling of the whole cybercrime operation. Tor offers a high degree of anonymity, but Tor tools are not immune to data leaks,"" says the Trend Micro post on the subject of TorRAT.  And although bitcoin exchanges being used as a tool for criminal activity is not good, government intervention will not help, according to Tuur Demeester who is a bitcoin expert and investor.  ""It's an illusion to believe that 'a war on fraud' in the exchange sector will make the problem go away,"" he said.  ""I think making the cost-benefit analysis, educating bitcoin users about the importance of security and the dangers of fraud will go a much longer way than creating ever more bureaucratic hoops for legitimate entrepreneurs to jump through.""",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/10/30/malware-gang-steals-14-million-and-sets-up-bitcoin-exchange-to-launder-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1f4c5c042799ae20143e2bef1bb07e3ec3f04c1f-950x534.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As well as providing a bitcoin wallet service, Blockchain.info is a block chain browser and features data and charts providing insight into the bitcoin network.  A representative from the site posted on reddit yesterday that it was about to reach 500,000 total wallets created and, in recognition of the support its users have given, was giving away 10 BTC to the lucky user who created wallet number 500,000.  Part of the message read: ""It's our mission to continue to build the most secure and private bitcoin wallet available, and our focus remains on giving users the best experience possible. From our team around the world, thank you from the bottom of our bitcoin hearts. Good luck!""  The post was later updated with the response of the winner, who stated: ""This is so immeasurably awesome! Thank you so much!""  They went on to say they didn’t actually know Blockchain.info was running a competition and hadn't dabbled in bitcoins for a few years.  ""[I] bought 5 BTC back when they were like £5 each, gutted that I sold them for £6 a few months later once I found out they were £140 each now!""

42425086,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHqwDh,1383152409,Australian crowdfunding site Pozible accepts bitcoin,"Another crowdfunding site is taking on bitcoin. Sydney-based Pozible started accepting the cryptocurrency for its projects on Monday.  The site, which claims a 55% success rate in funding projects, says that it began accepting bitcoin following demand from its users.  “Bitcoin has been making buzz around the internet for quite a bit of time, I don't think anyone working in the field can avoid that. I think it is a very exciting concept, we are curious and want to play with it,” said co-founder Rick Chen.  The site, which already accepts fiat currency, lets users send bitcoin funds using whatever wallet system they like, but it recommends CoinJar, another Australian firm.  Funds are sent to Pozible, which then forwards them to a project holder’s account when they reach their goal. If the goal isn’t reached, the funds are refunded.  Pozible has a range of features, including a forthcoming subscription crowdfunding campaign feature, in which regular payments can be made.  However, that will be a problem for bitcoin funding, as the protocol doesn’t support recurring payments. Chen said:  “Our subscription crowdfunding is still in beta, the initial release might not allow bitcoin to be used for pledging, unfortunately, but we will be keeping an eye on the development and hopefully allow that in the near future.”  Life isn’t easy for bitcoin crowdfunding sites, though. Emails for Coinfunder, which CoinDesk covered in June, are bouncing, and the site seems to be posting few new projects.  Another site, Bitcoinstarter, is slowly ramping up as bitcoin is getting more widespread.  “Right now the major challenges still tend to be the quality of the projects and reaching the proper audience to fund projects,” says Matt Allen, founder of Bitcoinstarter, which opened in April. “Bitcoin itself is still niche, so the projects tend to be the same also.”  The firm is hoping to get its application on Hive, the OSX bitcoin client that includes a section for compatible online bitcoin applications, and it is developing an API so that it can bring its Crowdfunding Reddit Tipbot online.  Bitcoinstarter has funded 11 projects in total since CoinDesk covered it in June, and has sent 67.6 BTC in total.  ""We figured at first smaller projects would be the major driver to start and we’ve been in talks with bigger projects ($100,000+),” says Allen. “But it’s a matter of trust at the moment dealing with these size projects. It will come.”  One of the problems with bitcoin-only projects is that the user base is relatively small.  Pozible might find it easier to curry favour from bitcoin users, because it started out with fiat currency. Bitcoin will simply appear as an option, meaning that projects can take funding in either. That is likely to give a project a greater chance of success.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/10/30/australian-crowdfunding-site-pozible-accepts-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c72915005b67a813be8c93b56cb643846e6d5c9f-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425098,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHqwZh,1383145247,FBI proves seizing bitcoins isn't the same as owning them,"While the FBI may have its hands on the founder of Silk Road’s bitcoin wallet, that doesn’t mean it has access to what's inside. Ross Ulbricht, despite his own self-incriminations as the mastermind behind the online black marketplace, was able to do one thing right: secure his bitcoins.  A reported 600,000 BTC belonging to Ulbricht is in the FBI’s hands. But they can’t access the bitcoin wallet because it is encrypted. This supposedly is separate from the 26,000 BTC that was left in an escrow account, which was being used to exchange money between the marketplace’s users and dealers.  For law enforcement, taking on new technologies isn’t always a smooth operation. As criminals adopt new concepts, cops have to figure out new crime-solving methods.  With bitcoin that’s no exception. But what most people in the bitcoin community can pretty much agree upon is the fact that killing off Silk Road was a good thing for the future of bitcoin.  ""Taking down Silk Road was an important step in helping legitimize and bring bitcoin into the mainstream. Liquidity is a big problem right now that impedes bitcoin's growth, hopefully this 5% stash can be recovered and reinserted into circulation to get more people and businesses using BTC,” said Travis Skweres, CEO of bitcoin exchange CoinMKT.  The feds owning bitcoin  It may make some BTC investors wary that a government entity is in possession of so many bitcoins. After all, it is fear of the Feds trying to shut down decentralized virtual currencies that may be the biggest risk of all right now for considering bitcoin as an asset class.  “I’ll be glad to see these bitcoins transitioned to the wider community,” says Jaron Lukasiewicz, the founder of Coinsetter, a high-performance bitcoin exchange designed for traders.  Not only will investors delight on seeing these bitcoins back on the market, such a huge amount being back in circulation will help volume, and thus liquidity overall.  “Without the private key, it would be impossible for the government to access the bitcoins,” says Ankur Nandwani, who runs bitcoin micropayments service BitMonet.  Conceivably, the government could make some sort of deal with Ulbricht to provide the key to the bitcoin wallet holding the approximate 489,000 bitcoins it cannot currently access.  It will be interesting to see if the government will try. It has made various statements in the past that it believes bitcoin is real money, but they can literally put money where their mouth is by making a deal to release those coins.  After all, 489,000 bitcoins is no small sum, amounting to over $92m in BTC using the latest CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index valuation.  Not talking  The feds certainly aren’t talking about what access they have to Ulbricht’s stash of bitcoins, but the block chain can prove to us a few things, says Dan Held of Zeroblock.  “We know the FBI has access to 144,000 bitcoins since they moved them on 10/25. Whether or not they have access to the remaining 489,000 bitcoins is debatable,” says Held.  Indeed, on 25th October, approximately 144,000 bitcoins were moved to this address. They were moved in segments of 324 BTC, which has been presumed to stand for “FBI” on a dial pad. Also, the phrase “DPR Seized Coins” was added as a note to each transaction on the block chain.  What might be the most intriguing aspect of these bitcoin seizures is just how the Feds will eventually get fiat for them. As it stands right now, dumping the amount of bitcoins that it has in its possession could take a long time, since exchanges are not used to handling that sort of volume.  The FBI has told Forbes that they will sell their bitcoin holdings after Ulbricht’s trial. But there might be a problem doing that all at once.  “Mt.Gox, BitStamp, and BTC-e combined don't have the volume necessary to facilitate a sale of that size,” said Zeroblock’s Held.  He’s probably right – daily volume for the top five exchanges is currently around 58,000 BTC, using the most recent 24-hour data from Bitcoin Charts.  The feds may have to ultimately auction off the coins, which might be of interest to any bitcoin investor out there.  “If they auction off the coins, it will most likely be at a discount to current prices, as there is not enough demand to execute at the current market price,” says Held.  What do you think about the FBI’s ownership of so many bitcoins – is there any way for them to access an encrypted wallet without Ulbricht’s help? Will the feds have to dump a huge amount of BTC on the market at some point? Let us know in the comments.

42425096,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHqwVh,1383132617,Robocoin launches bitcoin ATM in Vancouver,"Las Vegas-based startup Robocoin has partnered with Canadian company Bitcoiniacs to launch the first bitcoin-based ATM in Vancouver.  Speaking from the launch at Waves Coffee House, where the ATM is located, Robocoin CEO Jordan Kelley said: “It’s been a crazy day. I can't even tell you how incredible it is. There's a line in front of the machine right now.""  Kelley’s goal for Robocoin’s ATMs is to get bitcoin usage to the masses.  “Robocoin has the first bidirectional bitcoin ATM. That means it gives customers the easiest way to buy and sell bitcoins. Signing up for accounts on exchanges is arduous. You have to have bank account information. That's what kind of holds bitcoin back from mass adoption,” he says.  “You can literally walk up to the machine, scan your hand, and get started with bitcoin.”  The palm scanner is a way to identify a person’s bitcoin activity and to regulate the daily transaction limit, which in Canada is $3,000.  The great thing about the palm scanner, says Kelley, is that though it identifies the ATM user, it remains an anonymous method to transact in BTC.    “Walk up to the machine, tap buy or sell, scan your hand to create a unique ID, but with anonymity,” he says.    The company is currently using Bitstamp to process transactions, but it has been experimenting with others as well.  “We're experimenting with Mt. Gox, but we don't recommend it outside of Japan,” says Kelley.  Robocoin’s business model is to partner with local operators who know a country or region. The company’s focus is selling the ATM units, and then using a consultative approach with its partners.  “Our model is selling hardware to operators,” says Kelley. “Operators have a much better understanding of their environment. We partner with operators with software services and KYC [know your customer] compliance.”  Canada is an ideal place for the world’s first bitcoin ATM because the government there has taken a wait-and-see approach on any sort of regulatory measures on bitcoin. The local operator, Bitcoiniacs, even has a storefront on First Avenue in Vancouver offering customers bitcoin-based services.  “In Canada, bitcoin is more of a commodity. The government’s thinking is: Let's get a good understanding of what's going on before making any decisions,” says Robocoin’s Kelley. “Our focus is working hand in hand with governments,”.  As CoinDesk’s Danny Bradbury previously reported in September, Bitcoiniacs has purchased five ATM units from Robocoin.  The plan to implement the four others in various Canadian cities is still on track for this year, according to Kelly.
