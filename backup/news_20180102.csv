Feel like you missed out buying bitcoin?  So did Bitcoin Sign Guy once upon a time.

Now, however, he's a full-blown believer. In this sit-down interview, Bitcoin Sign Guy gives his outlook on bitcoin, why he thinks a central bank cryptocurrency won't work, what he sees as the industry's future and how it felt to become a certified crypto meme.

42428366,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7Vjh,1514930447,Report: Peter Thiel's Founders Fund Bets Millions on Bitcoin,"Founders Fund, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm known for its early investment in Facebook, is stepping into the world of cryptocurrencies, according to a new report.  Co-founded by high-profile investor Peter Thiel and based in San Francisco, Founders Fund has bought $15 million to $20 million worth of bitcoin across several of its recent funds, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing anonymous sources.  Although it is not entirely clear when the transactions were made or whether the firm has now sold any of its digital assets, the report said one of the funds began the investment as early as mid-2017.  As such, the firm now reportedly touts hundreds of millions of dollars in returns for its investors.  Good timing  According to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index, bitcoin mostly remained around $2,000 to $3,000 from May to July in 2017 but saw a strong growth over the past six months, having reached an all-time high at nearly $20,000 in December.  However, the news may not be entirely surprising given the billionaire co-founder of PayPal's previous support for the world's first cryptocurrency.  As reported by CoinDesk, Thiel was quoted in October of last year saying he believes the critics of bitcoin are ""underestimating"" the cryptocurrency and that bitcoin is like gold – meaning it has more potential as a long-term store of value than as an everyday payment method.

42428373,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7Vth,1514925321,Ethereum Foundation Announces Millions in Grants for Scaling Research,"The non-profit that oversees development of ethereum has officially unveiled two subsidy programs that will support research on how to grow the number of transactions its blockchain can process.  In a blog post published Tuesday, ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin described how the network is beginning to reach 1 million transactions per day. In his view, scaling the network is ""the single most important key technical challenge"" that developers need to work on before blockchain applications can be widely used.  As such, the subsidy programs are being launched to incentivize developers to implement two proposed solutions for scaling: sharding and layer-two protocols that would be built on top of the blockchain today.  Sharding is a process that requires only a few nodes on the blockchain to verify a transaction, instead of having every node do so. Currently, ether's developers are finishing the specifications for their sharding protocol, and are looking for teams to build implementations and launch them on ethereum’s testnet.  Layer-two protocols, on the other hand, take a different approach by taking transactions off the main ethereum blockchain. The network would allow transactions to move on and off the blockchain in order to be processed, but would not be used to actually process the transactions.  According to the blog post, the subsidies for each program will range from $50,000 to $1 million and are intended to cover development costs. For both solutions, successful teams will also have a hand in implementing the protocols on ethereum’s mainnet as a next phase.  In addition to the research ethereum’s developers are performing, the foundation is looking for third parties to look into the scaling issues.  In his post, Buterin wrote:  ""Independent teams of developers, companies and university and academic groups are all welcome to apply; we recognize that different types of applicants may require different formats and processes and we are willing to be flexible to accommodate individual teams’ needs.”  Vitalik image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TRADING | RESEARCH,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/01/02/ethereum-foundation-announces-millions-in-grants-for-scaling-research,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fc25947f1bdd54e21669cfeb4f95b3a58f436d2c-1500x919.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

At press time, the total value of the more than 1,300 publicly traded cryptocurrencies, as listed by data CoinMarketCap, set a new all-time high of $667 billion. As such, it's the latest sign that the entire cryptocurrency market has recovered from a correction on Dec. 22, when the market plunged more than 30 percent from around $648 billion to $422 billion.  Still, what's most notable about the rally is that data shows the world's largest cryptocurrency may not be a large contributor. Bitcoin's dominance, or its share of the total market cap, has now dropped to an all-time-low. Data suggests the value of all bitcoins is currently accounting for 35.6 percent of the entire marketplace.  Indeed, the metric saw a rather turbulent movement in 2017, having decreased sharply from over 80 percent to 37.46 percent in June. This was followed by a six-month bounce-back to 65 percent around early December.  Data from the market's overnight session (0:01~6:00 UTC), morning session (06:01~12:00 UTC) and afternoon session (12:01~18:00) suggest part of that decline may be due to rising interest in the broader cryptocurrency markets.

42428371,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7Vrh,1514916044,New Bitcoin Cash Tech Takes Aim at Accidental Spending Issue,"The developers behind Bitcoin ABC, a software implementation which accounts for 81.48% of all nodes running on the bitcoin cash network, have released a new update designed to solve an issue whereby users could lose funds when mixing up BTC and BCH addresses.  The problem stems from bitcoin cash's hard fork last year, which resulted in the cryptocurrency inheriting the same address format as bitcoin. As reported before, the issue enables some users to accidentally send funds in one currency to an address on the other currency's chain, meaning these users would lose their assets, either temporarily or permanently.  Bitcoin ABC lead developer Amaury Sechet announced last November that he was working on a new address format, called CashAddr, to prevent this issue from happening, describing this as a ""pressing need.""  In an email  , stated:  ""Using a new format will prevent users from mistakenly sending money on the wrong chain. It also accept payloads up to 512 bits which ensures we can deploy more secure way of doing multiparty smart contract in the future. Finally, it uses a version field ensuring we can encode new features in these addresses in the future without having to use a new format.""  On Tuesday, a new software version of Bitcoin ABC was published, which included CashAddr.  The change is mostly cosmetic. Implementing the new address requires exchanges, merchants and wallet providers to upgrade their software, but does not require a hard fork or for every node to also update to the new version.  The group also released a conversion tool to help users adjust to the format change.  In his initial announcement, Sechet proposed January 14 as a reasonable date for vendors to update their software.  Along with ending the address confusion, CashAddr includes more efficient error detection and allows for easier encoding of the new address format - specifically, users can now encode addresses into QR codes, making them easier to share.

Shawki Allam, the current Grand Mufti of Egypt, said on Jan. 1 that cryptocurrency trading is forbidden under Islamic religious law due to the risk associated with the activity, according to Egypt Today.  Allam issued his comments in the form of a fatwa, an interpretation of Islamic religious law. While the fatwa is not legally binding, it does count as a high-level legal opinion, and perhaps marks him as one of the first highest-ranking religious leaders in the Muslim world to forbid cryptocurrency trading under religious law.  According to the report, apart from its trading volatility, Shawki Allam also cited bitcoin's anonymity as a cause for concern, saying it can undermine the legal system by enabling tax evasion, money laundering, fraudulent activities and terrorist financing.  Just last month, a New York woman was indicted for allegedly giving financial support to ISIS terrorists using cryptocurrencies.  Although Egypt is still at a nascent stage of the cryptocurrency market, comments from Allam are similar to comments made by secular government bodies.

Citing anonymous sources, Yonhap News reports that the efforts to clamp down on speculative investing in the cryptocurrency markets now seemingly have a hard launch date.  The proposal essentially strengthens ""know-your-customer"" rules already in existence for exchanges and banks, and will require cryptocurrency exchange users to connect a bank account with identifying information in order to deposit or withdraw funds.  Other regulations include strengthening anti-money laundering rules, as well as a ban on issuing new anonymous virtual accounts. The government's proposals could even go as far as shutting down cryptocurrency exchanges within the country.  The new regulations were first announced last week by Hong Nam-ki, the minister of the Office for Government Policy Coordination. At the time, he told local news agencies that the government could not let speculation in cryptocurrencies ""go on any longer.""  South Korea will even restrict cryptocurrency advertising, he told reporters.  The country's Financial Intelligence Unit and the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) will oversee the rollout of the new regulations, including by inspecting exchanges and banks to ensure institutions are complying with the rules.  Last week, FSS governor Choe Heung-sik said he expected the bitcoin bubble to burst.  ""Companies existed during South Korea's IT bubble in the early 2000s, but that is not the case for bitcoin,"" he told reporters in a meeting.

42428374,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7Vxh,1514901605,"Aim, Fire: Bulletproofs Is a Crypto Privacy Breakthrough","There's a new privacy technology in the crypto Wild West, and if the rate at which it's winning favor from developers is any sign, it's one to watch.  Called ""bulletproofs,"" the new invention by University College of London's Jonathan Bootle and Stanford's Benedikt Bunz was announced last month, and quickly developers from major blockchains took steps to implement the code. Created initially for use on bitcoin, bulletproofs are already being adapted for monero and mimblewimble, and litecoin's creator has said its blockchain, one of the 10 largest, may follow suit.  And the reason for the interest is that bulletproofs is believed to offer something of a rarity in the cryptocurrency sector, code that is both simple for blockchains to execute and powerful in the way it boosts privacy.  While part of a public blockchain's appeal doubtless lies in the transparency it provides (enabling, say, more auditable financial markets), this attribute isn't always desirable, especially when users want to transact privately or enterprises need some level of confidentiality between partners.  Reflecting on the hype, Bunz told CoinDesk that while some of the cryptography underlying bulletproofs has been in use since the 1970s, new advancements are allowing it to be applied to cryptocurrency systems.  ""If there wasn't a clear application in mind, the time and resources would have been devoted to something else,"" Bunz said, continuing:  ""It's a lucky and good marriage of these two timelines working together. The killer application and the technology are meeting each other. The killer application is the money application.""  Behold, bulletproofs  Based on a technology called confidential transactions, bulletproofs' most notable feature may be that it minimizes computational excess.  Instead of obscuring the entirety of a blockchain, bulletproofs only conceals the quantities sent within a transaction – the sender and recipient's address are still visible, but the amount being sent is not. And while it's not total anonymity, the confidentiality added with bulletproofs can be handled by already operational blockchains, said Bunz.  ""I wouldn’t want my salary to be made public, and if you run a business you don't want to say publicly how much you're paying your supplier,"" Bunz said, adding:  ""I don't think you have to be a idealist to see that confidentially for money is basically a requirement.""  There could be other derivative benefits as well.  For example, according to reports from the monero developement team, the use of bulletproofs could reduce transaction fees (another hot topic as blockchain fees continue to rise) for private transactions by up to 80 percent.  On top of this, the more bulletproof transactions you verify at once, the cheaper the process gets, Bunz told an audience at a lecture in UCL, pointing out that this could mean it works even better when used with existing privacy tech like "" CoinJoinhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoinJoin"" – a popular piece of code that today fuses transactions together.  But it's not just the lightweight confidentiality that makes bulletproofs so attractive. It's also in the fact that the tech doesn't require trust in others, like zcash's zk-snarks tech does (the reason for its elaborate generation ceremonies). And, while the trusted setup is getting increasingly more secure, the process is still much criticized.  For bulletproofs, the real cause for celebration is perhaps that developers don't seem to have found any issues with it. Speaking to CoinDesk, anonymous researcher for the Monero Research Lab, Surang Noether described bulletproofs as a ""net win on all fronts"" for cryptocurrency.  Echoing that sentiment, Bunz told CoinDesk:  ""It's just better. It's shorter, more efficient, three times faster – it's better than the old system in every way.""  Testing continues  That said, bulletproofs technology is still young and nascent, and while other blockchain developers are interested in adding it to their tech stacks, it won't see implementation on bitcoin anytime soon.  On Reddit, co-author of the bulletproofs white paper and bitcoin developer Peter Wuille said its still ""far too premature"" to propose the tech's inclusion in bitcoin.  Adding to that, another co-author of the white paper, Andrew Poelstra, wrote on a mailing list that the tech is still not ready for a ""serious proposal to get anywhere.""  And speaking to CoinDesk, mimblewimble's lead developer, Ignotus Peverell, agreed with the hesitation, saying that the tech should be deployed and tested in the wild, on smaller platforms like monero or mimblewimble before high-profile blockchains like bitcoin should add the feature.  Still, according to Peverell:  ""We're a lot closer to that goal [of private transactions] now, than we were before bulletproofs.""

42428389,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7WLh,1514880240,2018's Resolution? Revisit Blockchain's Fundamentals,"William Mougayar is the author of ""The Business Blockchain"" and a board advisor to, and investor in, various blockchain projects and startups (see disclosures).  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      In the midst of a new wave of euphoria and interest in cryptocurrencies, it's all the more important that we remain clear on what the fuss is about.  Sure, rising cryptocurrency prices have given the field a flurry of mainstream headlines, resulting in higher consumer awareness and visibility. Undoubtedly, the cascading effect has attracted more participants, from eager speculators, to curious software developers, to novice users.  However, our emphasis should remain on how we apply the fundamental innovations of blockchain technology. As we enter 2018, it is clear to me that this key narrative has been lost on many, and as a New Year's resolution, I believe we should all be reminded of it.  When something as new and fundamental as the blockchain comes along, the initial reaction is to quickly apply its elements to what we currently see, as an overlay of the old. But this approach only gets us so far in terms of reaping the fruit of innovation.  We need to create new things, and not just tinker with the old.  As an analogy, the web’s first phase (web 1.0 era) consisted of plastering information on the web, and saw the development of early versions of e-commerce. But there was no social web, because we didn’t figure out the web's two-way read-write capabilities until later. The fundamental Web 2.0 innovation was about empowering users to add web value by being content publishers themselves.  With many token-based ICOs and other blockchain initiatives, it looks like we are copying what we already see instead of inventing what we don’t discern yet.  Against that backdrop, let us re-visit the blockchain’s fundamental innovations and be reminded that it is only by applying them that we will uncover the next versions of applications and protocols that will truly usher us into a crypto-based economy.  When you encounter blockchain implementations, technologies, applications, ICOs and projects, ask yourself if one or several of the following six fundamental outcomes are seriously being tackled:  1) Replacing Intermediaries and counterparties  That is a sine qua non condition for blockchain technology.  The original intent of bitcoin (which started this revolution) was to use the blockchain to validate the finality of transactions without counterparty involvement or intermediaries that relay (and delay) transactions. That is the essence of the trust network. You must ask how the blockchain is being used to fulfill this function, in lieu of synchronizing databases via intermediary players.  For example, one target application area is decentralized assets trading, where the initial order is relayed and settled on the blockchain directly, without exchanges.  2) Native assets liquidity  Thanks to CryptoKitties, native assets on the blockchain are getting a memorable poster child.  Consider the fact that cryptocurrency itself is the first native asset of the blockchain. But any digital asset with a unique ownership component can – and will – be traded on the blockchain.  Of course, the first candidates are assets that already have a digital form, but think about also applying fractional ownerships to hard assets, and giving them instant liquidity. Global asset liquidity is going to get a boost, as much of the world’s non-liquid assets will have a chance to trade on the blockchain.  3) Proofs of X  If the blockchain represents the version of the truth, we need to be able to go somewhere and check that truth. I would like to start seeing easy-to-use portals and capabilities that query blockchains for business answers, just like Etherscan and Blockchain (the company) allow us to query them for technical transactions details and respective history about the ethereum and bitcoin blockchain.  Did this particular event take place at this specific time, and between what parties? Who owned this asset on this given date? When did we learn about this event?  There are so many examples waiting to become the next ""Googling” equivalent for the blockchain.  4) Letting the blockchain enact consequences  Smart contracts are the execution instigators for blockchain logic.  Their outcome is to enact the result of certain programmable conditions, and we are gradually learning to gain their confidence by giving them more autonomy. Blockchains should be able send funds, reward users, transfer ownerships, accept votes, release rights or do whatever smart contracts program them to do.  Of course, mistakes and poor implementations can lead to bad consequences, but that also comes with this new territory. So, this part comes a degree of caution that we need to fully test and start by taking initial steps with, before endowing greater enactment responsibilities to the blockchain.  5) Peer-to-peer infrastructures  Another key tenet of blockchains is the peer-to-peer infrastructure underlying its operations.  As a starting point for setting up a blockchain network, computer servers represent this peer-to-peer infrastructure, but we should not forget they can include anyone with a smartphone or a personal computer. Sometimes, this infrastructure features just people as users, and sometimes it consists of servers and people. Regardless, it is a slice of the innovation side of the blockchain that deals with its deployment in ways that weren't possible before.  A blockchain with limited P2P infrastructure will have limited impact on its participants.  6) Network effects at the protocol levels  Horizontal or vertical protocols are the next fabric upon which many blockchain applications will depend on. This might be the equivalent of the web standards we are used to, like HTTP, HTML, URLs, CSS, XML, etc.  Standards enable the proliferation of usage, because of the knowledge network effects around them. We need to see more network effects applied to blockchain technology, where every additional user adds value to the rest of the network.  With that backdrop of capabilities in mind, you can apply ""acid test"" questions for blockchain implementations you encounter. Answering at least one of them in the affirmative, then expanding on a further description of exactly how it is being done, is a necessary condition that would point you towards where blockchain innovation is in the works.  What intermediaries or counterparties are you replacing?  What tradable native assets are you creating or recording?  What are the consequences that the blockchain is empowered to automatically act upon?  What peer-to-peer infrastructure are you relying on?  How are you achieving network effects at the blockchain level?  What added value does every new user provide for the rest of network?  Two years ago, crypto-engineers were rushing (and gushing) to the market, with their immature technology. Today, the trend is reversed.  While most blockchain developers and researchers have hunkered down trying to perfect their technology, business people are the ones rushing to the market with immature business models. We must ask whether any blockchain project is leading us to unchartered levels of true innovation, or diverting us into a meandering path of distraction.  Many short-sighted blockchain projects start via an intention to place some record on a blockchain ledger. That task is becoming easier, but it is only a starting point, and that is certainly not enough.  Inventing the future on the blockchain is hard, but if you diligently endeavor to apply the fundamental innovations of blockchain technology, you might land on some breakthroughs.

42428361,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7SFh,1514869303,What Do We Do With All This Money?,"Wendy Xiao Schadeck is a venture investor at Northzone, based in New York City. She has been following the blockchain space closely, focusing on the behavioral perspective.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      With $4 billion in capital raised in ICOs, and very little utility value to show for it, it's tempting to call token offerings a bubble.  However, the more likely truth is that the same forces that gave rise to today's paradigm-shifting technologies (see: Carlota Perez's definitive book) are at play in the world of crypto. And that while we may be entering bubble territory, the key difference between tulips and crypto is how speculative capital was deployed – the former into manufacturing an asset and the latter into technology development.  Still, money is no guarantee of success, which is why I've been spending a lot of time thinking about capital deployment into crypto, a topic deserving of more attention because it will be a major proof point for the ecosystem's long-term trajectory.  It is also an area of competitive advantage for crypto projects in the next five years.  That's because unlike the centralized technology companies we're used to, entrepreneurs building decentralized projects cannot scale their efforts by hiring an executive team and then recruiting VPs of each function who then all report into them, in some pyramidal structure.  Every dollar and ounce of energy spent should maximize value for the network rather than the organization.  Not only does this have implications on what kind of entrepreneurial mindset will be successful in this paradigm, but allocating capital to grow a decentralized network is unexplored territory. Luckily, tokens have proven to be very effective motivators, and even better, they aren't constrained to people who are directly affiliated with the organization like equities are with employees.  It makes the most sense that the network should reward participants proportional to how much work they do for the network.  If we look at the growth of bitcoin and ethereum, mining was an elegant capital distribution mechanism in the early days. However, there are still some tweaks to be made to this model in that it doesn't fully incentivize smaller players to join-in at scale. That, however, is a topic to be saved for a separate blog post...  Sweet spots  I will preface this post by saying that this is just a hypothesis on my part, not backed by any data except for a few projects that seemed to have executed this well.  I have long believed that token offerings shouldn't be used as capital raising mechanisms beyond after the point at which the network the team is building still benefits more from being mostly centralized, and that is perhaps only in the product development stage.  Afterwards, a well-designed mass incentive system (airdrops, mining or perhaps some other new mechanism) is more efficient for getting builders to contribute to the network. At that point, they directly benefit from the value created in the token.  In other words, if we oversimplify the value growth in a network, excluding speculative effects (in the chart below) any excess funding raised by the early team past the inflection point (especially at a premium) should represent some dead weight loss to the future network participants.  In this case, the team benefits from the token's early price appreciation rather than the network, and the team also has to figure out how to redistribute it the capital in an efficient, decentralized way while generating returns on any undeployed capital.  One way for teams who have already gone down that path is to minimize the deadweight loss is to think of rewarding builders in terms of percentage of network rather than the value in fiat to simulate a token reward.  But, this is a little harder for pre-product networks already valued in the billions.  Still, my hypothesis does not factor in other ways to deploy cash such as pursuing biz-dev opportunities and investing in applications on top of the network.  I might argue that is potentially distracting for the early development team, though I’ll leave it as an open question whether an independent entity made wealthy from the early token price appreciation (and who might most easily specialize in these activities), might be the best entity to execute biz-dev and investing.  If we take bitcoin and ethereum again as examples, these independent entities exist and have contributed significantly to the growth of the two ecosystems.  Airdrops  Perhaps, I am operating with a huge VC bias, but this hypothesis seems to be playing out in the market where accredited investors continue to fund the early team and take product risk, with the public joining in later.  This is very different from even six months ago, and some of it is due to regulatory risk, while some of it is due to the market self-correcting. More so, I am seeing airdropping as a norm for the next phase of development to bootstrap an early community post-product.  Airdropping is interesting because it can represent the first stage of the mass-incentive mechanism I discussed above. The best airdropping mechanisms should both attract the highest potential value creators for the network and should be earned by its recipients.  The first point is a bit more obvious, but the latter point relates to the psychology of ""free"" product. Giving things away for free is good for generating trial behavior because the notion of ""freeness"" exciting beyond the marginal value delivered by that good.  However, it has the potential to makes people think they should get it for free forever if they didn’t do anything to earn it.  Economists have long studied the notion of freeness and endowment effects, which show us that the more work you do for something, the more you feel ownership towards it, thus the more you value it.  This is perhaps another argument for airdrops that simulate ""mining"" and only to a small group of hardcore HODLers who commit to doing work, rather than airdropping to every crypto-influencer in the world.  Speed on our side  A point I want to end with is that in crypto, we generally want to use financial incentives to govern what previously was governed by social incentives. I think most teams underestimate the difficulty of building a perfect financial incentive model as the possibilities for gaming the system are seemingly endless.  As soon as we introduce a financial incentive mechanism into the equation, people quickly abandon the social governance mechanism, and it is very hard to rebuild. Therefore, we should experiment but understand the risks that by adding financial incentives, some models may be broken beyond recognition.  Perhaps, we shouldn’t abandon social incentives altogether but think about how we can supplement them with financial incentives to grow the market.  Overall, I am very bullish on these experiments, because in only very recent human history, we’ve managed to build a monetary and financial system to govern most of the business world and we've grown our economy dramatically as a result.
