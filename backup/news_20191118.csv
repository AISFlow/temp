42383010,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tilh,1574118012,"DAI Is Moving Beyond Ether, But DeFi Isn't Decentralized Just Yet","The Takeaway  MakerDAO, the flagship project of 2019's decentralized finance (DeFi) boom, launched the multi-collateral version of its DAI stablecoin on Monday.  Users can now ""lock in"" BAT as collateral for dollar-pegged loans. Previously, only ether could be used as collateral.  But despite the rapid growth of the sector and the diversification of assets involved, DeFi is still influenced by a handful of central players: Namely, Polychain Capital, a16z, 1confirmation, and unknown MKR whales.  With governance decisions largely influenced by those with the largest stakes to lose, some crypto veterans are pushing for a closer examination of MakerDAO's marketing directives.    MakerDAO may be diversifying the assets it works with, but it has a long way to go to decentralize the power to make key decisions.      On Monday, the cryptocurrency lending platform moved to multi-collateral stablecoin loans, marking a new era for the decentralized finance (DeFi) movement.      Previously, collateral for loans could only be committed in ether, but now MakeDAO also works with the Basic Attention Token (BAT) and also offers a DAI savings option. (The old version of the ether-backed DAI stablecoin is now called SAI, signifying “single-collateral.” For the sake of simplicity, this article will use the term “DAI” interchangeably because service providers may automatically convert it and community pages such as the MakerDAO GitHub are urging people to freely turn their SAI into DAI.)      But while users have more choices, a relatively small group of individuals govern the protocol.    More than 150 unique MKR token addresses voted in Monday’s transition proposalhttps://vote.makerdao.com/executive-proposal/multicollateral-dai-launch--november-18-2019, one of the highest voter turnouts to date, MakerDAO president Steven Becker said. However, that vote included roughly 80,000 tokens estimated to cost $662 each and just five addresses represented more than 50 percent of voting tokens. In short, the votes cast by people with modest holdings were mostly a ceremonial nod of approval.    “It was really important to showcase what governance [participants] have done in selecting BAT, in order to figure out what to do going forward with other collateral types,” Becker said in an interview Monday.      It’s unclear who the voters were that powered the BAT choice, but Becker said the attributes discussed in public calls included “liquidity in secondary markets” like Coinbase and other exchanges. The protocol itself is open source, but the people building accessible portals to it are generally working for such traditional firms.      The bottom line is the majority of people funding this movement, which they retain the power to influence, could fit into one room. In this sense, DeFi isn’t all that decentralized yet.      The current DeFi ecosystem is predominantly made up of “centralized products and services” with a better user experience than interacting directly with blockchain protocols, said veteran crypto investor Meltem Demirors.      “We are hopeful that over time, disintermediation will become possible,” Demirors said, adding that “market forces” and regulations have forced “intermediation and centralization by service providers.”      Rather than getting hung up on prompt decentralization, DeFi companies should focus on transparently disclosing their roles in the ecosystem and the fees they charge, she said.      Those roles are often intertwining. For example, ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin funded the early development of exchange tool Uniswap, founder Hayden Adams told CoinDesk in May. Then Paradigm, including Coinbase co-founder Fred Erhsam, led the first venture round for Uniswap.      Paradigm also participated in the recent Compound raise, and this fund was just one of several from the Series A that hailed from the same group funding MakerDAO, like Andreessen Horowitz’s a16z crypto fund. Polychain Capital, headed by Coinbase alumnus Olaf Carlson-Wee, and Coinbase Ventures both also invested in the DeFi startup Dharma Labs. Following the raise, Dharma Labs switched to leveraging Compound’s protocol.      Further, contrary to what the term DeFi might imply, MakerDAO can “terminate or suspend” access to DAI, and the Compound lending pools are actually custodial. This may be a compliance measure, to avoid usage that violates economic sanctions. After all, the people working for companies like the Maker Foundation and Coinbase interact with the technology in measurable ways, even if they do not claim ownership of it.    Recycling    Back in 2018, four years after MakerDAO started, Demirors described Coinbase as one of the entities using “fancy financial engineering” to offer the illusion of growth.      While there are many unknown DeFi users, those who benefit the most from it appear to be those who have influence in the system.      Even Compound founder Robert Leshner said so far “teams in crypto that have stockpiles of DAI and crypto” are the most frequent protocol users.      Blockchain consultant Maya Zehavi, who agreed with Demirors’ recycling theory as it relates to DeFi startups Compound and Dharma Labs, tweeted it’s an open secret within the industry that MKR market makers are propping up the ethereum ecosystem with externalized risk. In her tweet, Zehavi said this model is evocative of a “central bank.”      For example, the largest liquidity provider currently contributing to the Compound ecosystem offered more than $1 million worth of DAI and appears to be repeatedly swapping parts of this pool for USDC, a stablecoin developed in part by Coinbase. Indeed, Coinbase announced in September it would be “investing USDC directly in the [Compound] protocol.”      It may be too soon to call the DeFi system “decentralized,” but there is certainly a great deal of capital involved. According to DeFi Pulse, there is over $660 million worth of cryptocurrency locked up in these smart contracts. This represents triple the amount involved this time last year, when there was $220 million worth of ether in these systems.      On the other hand, Tether co-founder William Quigley said the DAI ecosystem is far more decentralized than his godfather stablecoin.      “I would call it quite decentralized, aside from the oracle system,” Quigley said of contemporary DeFi. “On-chain leverage is a fantastic creation and I credit MakerDAO with that.”      However, the addition of BAT as the first asset beyond ether supported by Monday’s multi-collateral update complicates notions of a Coinbase “mafia” calling the shots in the DeFi realm. None of the known investors in Brave Software, the company behind BAT, are DeFi leaders. The BAT token sale in 2017 notoriously sold out within seconds, which implies whales and veteran investors gobbled up the tokens. It’s unclear whether DeFi investors are among them, although 1confirmation said it did not participate in the BAT sale. (CoinDesk reached out to the BAT team and will update the article if we hear back.)      “I have my suspicions as to why BAT was chosen as the first collateral, and that has to do with voting,” Quigley said. “I haven’t seen a lot of communication among them [BAT fans] saying, ‘Wow, we really want this.’ But someone is going to use it. And there will probably be some sort of arbitrage.”      He added that, although voter turnout is low and possibly skewed by niche interests, the DAI DeFi system is more decentralized and accessible than stablecoin predecessors that relied on just a few companies, like Tether.      Theoretically, anyone with internet access and software engineering skills could build an interface to access these protocols. This possibility, which so far has yet to be realized to any measurable scale beyond the interfaces funded by ecosystem creators themselves, is what Andreessen Horowitz partner Chris Dixon said inspired his firm to invest in both Compound and Coinbase.      “Compound is a lending protocol that is open to anyone in the world, that disintermediates banks and allows anyone to earn interest on their money,” Dixon said.    Community growth    To be fair, MyCrypto CEO Taylor Monahan, an MKR holder, said MakerDAO’s loan system does a “pretty good” job informing users about the risks inherent to these loans while still scaling this experiment.      “When you think about what’s been accomplished it’s super exciting. You can’t undermine that,” she said, referring to the sheer number of loans issued through the DeFi ecosystem.      Compound’s website tallies at least 1,278 borrowers and MakerScan lists more than 1,960 DAI loans created so far in November alone (out of 148,173 loans over the past 12 months). These projects also actively encourage user participation through public polls and open-source code.      “To the point about participation, that is a general condition that needs to develop as the protocol develops,” Becker said, adding “up to 100 people and organizations” now dial in to the open governance calls, which only attracted six or seven people a year ago.      Yet there are less than a few dozen people, via the above-listed ventures, who currently dominate both liquidity and voting power across the leading DeFi platforms. Monahan, for example, said she has yet to vote because she said the process is still too cumbersome to be a priority for her. Ethereum community veterans like Monahan and developer Georgios Konstantopoulos have also expressed concern that the updated language used to market these automated services as “vaults” and “savings” misrepresents their current level of security.      Meanwhile, Nadia Alvarez, MakerDAO’s head of business development in Latin America, is busy working on educational initiatives to collect user feedback from marginalized user groups.      “We want to develop their curiosity around the blockchain and other financial options they have,” she said, speaking of Brazilian students in one such program. “It’s an incredible opportunity to create new solutions thinking of the actual needs of people in different countries.”      Argentinian ex-pat María Paula Fernandez, an ethereum community veteran who holds her savings in DAI and uses DeFi projects to pay for her daily expenses, said the risky collateralized loans seem to her like a financial crisis waiting to happen.      Although she also is bullish on the potential of DeFi, Fernandez tweeted in the lead-up to multi-collateral DAI that she hopes the community stays mindful of “not creating a bubble of over-collateralization and marketing.”      MakerDAO’s head of smart contracts, Mariano Conti, based in inflation-riddled Argentina, also relies on DAI for everyday expenses.      ""I put my money where my mouth is. I've been getting paid exclusively in Sai for over two years, and I can't wait for my next paycheck to be in (Multi-Collateral) Dai,” he said via email. “I hope Dai continues to be the backbone of DeFi on ethereum.""    Governance    The DeFi user base is diversifying far faster than the community of influential participants – that is, those who vote, serve as market makers and build products that tap into the open protocols.      The investors behind DeFi projects like the Maker Foundation, Uniswap and Compound are all heavily invested in the tokens supported by these systems. For example, the public vote to add MKR support to Compound was weighted to favor voters who had earned the most interest using the protocol. So it favored Compound’s investors that include institutional MKR holders, namely Polychain Capital and a16z. (This isn’t unique to DeFi ecosystems; it is a general dilemma presented by proof-of-stake systems.)      The Ethereum Foundation’s founder himself, Buterin, also owns MKR in addition to tokens from two projects he advised, Augur and OmiseGo. All of the above are already supported by Compound or are under consideration for multi-collateral DAI. Becker said there is no finite deadline for which assets will be added to DAI’s collateral system, or when.      “That’s really up to Maker governance, that is MKR token holders, to decide going forward,” he said.      To their credit, Becker said the foundation is currently working with Ernst & Young to restructure the non-profit’s board, which does not include the above-listed MKR holders. Thousands of people who own small amounts of MKR can, and do, sway polls by participating in governance calls, forum debates, and signaling their commitment by casting votes with smaller amounts of MKR.      “It ranges from leverage traders all the way through to basic transactional users as well, folks that want to pay freelancers or put their DAI onto various wallets and use it for transaction purposes,” Becker said. “In doing that [voting on new collateral types] it provides the necessary robustness to the protocol as a whole.”      For MakerDAO’s Alvarez, she hopes the educational programs she is working on will prompt crypto companies around the world to offer marginalized DeFi users jobs and internships. This could, in addition to offering these users income, empower diverse users to participate in governance.      “It would be great if more projects, beyond MakerDAO, could help give tools to these people so we can help create new solutions,” she said. “For us, it’s very important to have this integration with society.”      Mariano Conti presents on using DAI for daily expenses at Devcon 5, photo by Leigh Cuen for CoinDesk",NEUTRAL,BAT | MKR | DAI,BAT | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MKR | DAI,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/11/18/dai-is-moving-beyond-ether-but-defi-isnt-decentralized-just-yet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/27875a30ef3189dcde974974d5b755571f1ebd0b-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42387616,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQlvHN,1574114727,The SEC Is Reviewing the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Rejection,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is taking a second look at the rejection of a recent bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposal.  Overturning the rejection would clear the way for potentially the first bitcoin ETF in the U.S., following years of anticipation of a mainstream-ready investment product.  According to a notice published in the Federal Register over the weekend and dated Nov. 18, the SEC’s five commissioners will review the bitcoin ETF put forth by Bitwise Asset Management.  Bitwise did not request the review, said Matt Hougan, the company’s global head of research.  “We do, however, welcome the opportunity to submit comments and continue the dialogue with the SEC,” he said in an email.  The rejection was written by the agency’s Division of Trading and Markets on Oct. 9. The Nov. 18 notice actually references a letter from the SEC’s commissioners dated Oct. 15.  It is not clear what triggered the SEC’s review. Under current federal law, the commissioners can grant a review at their discretion, or following the filing of a petition.  The order rejecting the proposal will remain in effect until the review has concluded, the notice said, with the commissioners either upholding the staff rejection or overturning it. As part of the review, the general public can comment on the rejection through Dec. 18, 2019.  Groundhog day  Unlike the SEC’s formal approval or disapproval process, there are no set deadlines for the review of a decision. The Commission has previously reviewed the rejection of a bitcoin ETF proposal filed by the family office of Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, ultimately upholding the decision after more than a year.  It is possible that an SEC commissioner may have called for the Bitwise review.  Famously, Commissioner Hester Peirce – dubbed “Crypto Mom” by the community – announced the review of nine rejected bitcoin ETF applications in 2018. Peirce also dissented from the SEC’s second rejection of the Winklevoss ETF.  The ETF applications, filed in late 2017 and early 2018 by GraniteShares, ProShares and Direxion, were rejected in August 2018, with Peirce announcing their review the next day. However, it remains unclear what the status of this review is, or whether any of these decisions will be overturned.  Neither Peirce nor an SEC spokesperson immediately responded to emailed requests for comment. ProShares declined to comment, and a request for comment to Direxion was not returned by press time.  GraniteShares CEO Will Rhind told CoinDesk in a phone call that nothing had come of the SEC’s review so far, and he did not expect this to change in the near future.  “I think [SEC Chairman Jay Clayton] has spoken publicly about the ETF applications and … he’s made it clear at least from the top that the market has to mature a little bit before there’ll be an approval,” he said.

42383023,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tiyH,1574111171,Andrew Yang Campaign Releases Technology Plan Focused on Rebuilding Public Relationship With Big Tech,"Crypto-friendly U.S. presidential candidate Andrew Yang unveiled his campaign's technology plan focused on how to rebuild America’s relationship to its big tech behemoths, in addition to his calls for normalizing how crypto is treated at the regulatory level.      In a policy proposal posted to his website, Yang proposes stringent data protection laws, a “Department of Technology,” child-protection health guidelines and changes to section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the central tenet of internet regulation that shields websites from their users’ actions.      Details of his crypto plan come near the end of the 3,500-word tech manifesto.      Yang pledged to “preempt state regulations” such as the “onerous” New York BitLicense, that he said “has had a chilling effect on the US digital asset market.” New York’s law is already leading to legislative arbitrage with far flung states, such as Wyoming, which is presenting a state-based solution to the national crypto banking registration question.      Much of Yang's crypto stance was taken from his previous campaign statements.      “Cryptocurrencies and digital assets have quickly grown to represent a large amount of value and economic activity, outstripping government’s response,” he said. “We shouldn’t stifle innovation, but we also shouldn’t let it outpace our ability to regulate it.”      Yang proposed defining tokens and clarifying crypto tax laws, protecting consumers and promoting competition between platforms. That means bringing legislative clarity to a technology notoriously ridden with fraud, he said.      His solution: demand that the disparate parts of the American government – from tax collectors, securities regulators, legislators and agencies at large – define their stances on crypto assets, removing uncertainty that could be preventing mass adoption.      The Democratic hopeful is an outspoken evangelist for cryptocurrencies and blockchain. He supports blockchain-based voting platforms, derided cumbersome regulatory schemes and lauded blockchain as “one of the key technologies.”      Yang has even attended industry conferences. At Consensus 2019 he called himself a friend of the industry and pledged to support it if he were to win.      “If I’m in the White House oh boy are we going to have some fun,” he said at the time.

The proposal by America’s disaster response mitigators comes via a draft text of the National Advisory Council’s (NAC) November reporthttps://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/1572880188002-31454e3c26dff6922fde9d34cbe19e26/November_2019_NAC_Report_Draft_v5.pdf published on Monday.    NAC’s recommendation builds on a federal history of considering blockchain applications in disaster relief. Last December, the Department of Defense’s Defense Logistics Agency unit met to discuss how blockchain could have helped the post-Maria effort in Puerto Rico.      The advisory body's draft text asks FEMA Administrator Peter Gaynor to first launch a blockchain pilot program for land registries. The NAC argued that blockchain could simplify and improve the speed of government payouts communities rely on in the wake of natural disasters.      “In many disasters, such as Hurricanes Maria in Puerto Rico or Harvey in Texas, affected communities may lose the type of information needed to file a claim, such as policy documents, land ownership records, and personal identification, among others,” the draft said.      “By piloting a blockchain-based registry in this manner, FEMA can catalyze cross-sector engagement and develop technology-enabled use cases that can improve the speed of disaster responses and insurance claim payments, without sacrificing accuracy or increasing the risk of fraud.”      Beyond building a pilot, the NAC recommends that FEMA partner with insurance agencies to launch the service, improving its ability to quickly send its “disaster dividend” or “harm’s way” payouts to those impacted by disasters.    Decentralization for disasters      In its draft report, the NAC said FEMA should pursue blockchain solutions for disaster relief because of the advantages of maintaining records in multiple locations.      Because of decentralization, a blockchain solution would save important information across many servers, effectively neutralizing the threat of a single point-of-failure that one flood could inflict, in terms of damage from a major storm if all the data were kept in one physical location.      “Their principal attractiveness is their decentralized structure, which improves resilience and recovery efforts in a disaster because critical information is stored off-site and in a highly trusted, secure platform.”    The NAC previously issued recommendations around blockchain technology, though not for disaster relief payouts. After its November 2018 meeting, the council recommendedhttps://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/1554477439190-1f686d0044b2eed0c72c88da84376ee6/November_2018_Recommendations_Memo_final.pdf former Administrator Brock Long launch a blockchain pilot for FEMA’s “inefficient” and disparate housing assistance programs.    “Worse this inefficiency places a tremendous burden on disaster survivors trying to cope with multiple program requirements, lost documentation, and redundant requests while still reeling from disaster effects,” NAC Chairman Nim Kidd said in the letter.      Any on-the-ground application of the NAC’s proposal is far off.      Administrator Gaynor would need to adopt NAC’s final recommendations, and then FEMA would need “to convene, scope, and monitor a pilot project between key stakeholders, including technology firms, academic institutions,” plus recruit state and local leaders who might want to get involved.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2019/11/18/fema-advisory-board-proposes-blockchain-to-speed-disaster-dividend-payouts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/778681fc72b36dff29daffbff9013691d9e0cfb3-1200x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383003,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tict,1574109009,"Bitcoin Tumbles 4.7%, Most in Two Months, as China-Fueled Enthusiasm Wanes","Bitcoin prices tumbled on Monday by the most in two months, falling below a key threshold of $8,200 not seen since late October.      The bellwether cryptocurrency changed hands at $8,139.64 as of 18:41 UTC (1:41 p.m. New York time), down 4.7% over the prior 24 hours, according to CoinDesk's bitcoin price index (BPI). The price is still more than double where it started 2018, making bitcoin one of the world's best-performing assets.      Bitcoin's price surged in late October after Chinese President Xi Jinping said the country planned to embrace the blockchain – the type of decentralized computer-programming network that underpins cryptocurrencies – as a core technology. Many traders and investors speculated at the time that bitcoin, as the oldest cryptocurrency and the largest by market value, stood to benefit from the new push by the world's second-largest economy.      But according to Joe DiPasquale, CEO of the cryptocurrency hedge-fund firm BitBull Capital, there haven't been enough developments since then to create additional enthusiasm among traders and investors. Bitcoin had traded for several weeks in a range between $9,100 and $9,600, so a recent move below that level may have spurred some traders to sell, exacerbating the price drop. Trading volumes also have been unusually low recently, he said.      ""We expect for there to be some investors taking profit after these big newsworthy spikes,"" DiPasquale said in a phone interview.      Market signals suggest the price is likely to find support at $8,100, DiPasquale said, and if it fell below that level, the cryptocurrency would probably drop further, toward $7,400.      In the longer term, DiPasquale said, there is a bullish case for bitcoin due to the so-called ""halving"" expected in May 2020 – when rewards for mining new blocks of transactions will be cut in half, essentially reducing the supply of new units of the cryptocurrency.      If the price jumps back above $9,000, he said, bitcoin would then probably head back toward $10,000, DiPasquale said.

RBC spokesperson Ed Jones pushed back on recent media reports that Canada’s largest bank was exploring the development of a crypto exchange, telling CoinDesk via email on Monday that a number of recent patent applications filed by the bank do not indicate any intention to actually launch an exchange.      Canadian news source The Logic reported last week that the bank was “exploring” the launch of a crypto trading platform. A number of other news sites picked up the story or republished The Logic’s version.      Jones said these sites speculated on the purpose of a number of crypto and blockchain-related patent applications that RBC has filed.      “While RBC does not comment on ongoing proprietary research and development, we can confirm that these patent filings are not in support of work towards a cryptocurrency exchange for clients,” the spokesperson said. “RBC has no near-term plans to launch a cryptocurrency exchange for clients.”      Numerous other banks have filed patent applications related to blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Bank of America, for example, has long been active in the blockchain space, filing for patents as early as 2014.      Bank of America has yet to announce any major crypto-related initiatives, though it has quietly piloted Ripple’s distributed ledger tech and is otherwise engaged in the space.      Jones explained that RBC filed applications “as part of the innovation and discovery process.”      “RBC, like many other organizations, files patent applications to ensure proprietary ideas and concepts are protected,” he said.

The UK Jurisdiction Taskforce of the Lawtech Delivery Panel published a legal statement Monday, recognizing crypto assets as ""tradable property"" under English and Welsh law. The statement also defines smart contracts as ""enforceable agreements"" under English law.  The government-backed LTDP is an industry-led effort set up to assist the transformation of the U.K. legal sector through technology. The UK Jurisdiction Taskforce – one of six panels under its umbrella – is chaired by Sir Geoffrey Vos, chancellor of the U.K.'s high court, and also includes members such as Christopher Woolard, board member of the Financial Conduct Authority, and Sir Antony Zacaroli, justice of the high court.  Calling the statement a ""watershed,"" Sir Vos said it addresses a number of ""difficult legal topics in a very approachable and intelligible manner."" The task force undertook the effort to ""provide much needed market confidence and a degree of legal certainty as regards English common law in an area that is critical to the successful development and use of cryptoassets and smart contracts in the global financial services industry and beyond,"" he said.  The statement is expected to provide a solid foundation for the mainstream adoption of crypto assets and smart contracts in the U.K. and potentially give a boost to companies working in the crypto industry.  The task force further explained the potential importance of smart contracts in the press release, saying:  Smart contracts can be used to create more secure and more efficient ways of implementing (and automating performance of) contracts between parties. This could revolutionise agreements, from mortgages and medical research to property ownership, as smart contracts automatically execute transactions and remove the need for a middle man.  The statement was finalized after consultation with ""the tech community"" and the financial services sector, as well as regulators and legal experts, Sir Vos said.

42383022,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tix1,1574085677,US Crypto Firms Will Soon Have Another Banking Option,"Things may be about to get a little easier for firms working with cryptocurrency in the U.S.      U.K.-based Cashaa, which describes itself as a banking service platform, is about to launch bank accounts for stateside crypto firms denominated in U.S. dollars.      The new accounts will be open for applications from Nov. 25, with Cashaa saying they offer full banking features with access to all nations globally, bar sanctioned jurisdictions.      Archit Aggarwal, Cashaa's chief product officer, further said the accounts would be domiciled in the U.S. and have ""full access"" to automated clearinghouse (ACH) and SWIFT networks. Crypto and other ""high risk"" firms will need to fork out an account set-up fee of 250,000 CAS – Cashaa's own token. That's roughly $1,576 at the token's current price of $0.006306, according to CoinMarketCap data.      The firm also said it's created a ""pre-compliance team"" to make onboarding new firms a quicker affair, as well as to cut down on account rejections.      ""Since our pre-compliance team started working, our onboarding speed has doubled with our U.K.-regulated partner entities. Partnering with a US bank will help us expand our services to the USA as well as provide our existing customers more opportunities,"" said Aggarwal.      Crypto industry companies in the U.S., as well as other jurisdictions, have traditionally struggled to find banks that will serve them. Even if they do, accounts may be closed without notice or warning over the perceived risks of cryptocurrencies. As such, there are relatively few crypto-friendly banks allowing firms to conduct normal daily business as other more traditional industries would expect as standard.      One such haven is Silvergate Bank, which listed on the New York Stock Exchange earlier this month.      Cashaa's new service, however, comes via a partnership with Metropolitan Commercial Bank, which has also been working to draw crypto business for some time. The bank said in interview last year that, while cryptocurrency businesses are pariahs to traditional banks, to it, they’re “pioneers.” The push to draw more crypto firms brought a more than 300-percent increase, year-on-year, in the bank's non-interest income, Metropolitan said last April.      ""Traditional banks currently underserve crypto-related businesses,"" said Cashaa's co-founder and VP of marketing, in last week's announcement.

42383015,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tipT,1574079943,Chinese Army's Blockchain Provider Approved for New Hyperledger Certification Program,"Hyperledger, the open-source blockchain alliance backed by the Linux Foundation, has green-lit a Beijing-based firm that also serves the Chinese army to join its new certification program.      Only five companies are authorized Hyperledger Certified Service Providers (HCSP), allowed to offer support, consulting, training and professional services, including installation, configuration and troubleshooting, to other enterprises exploring blockchain technologies, Hyperledger said.      The three U.S. members are IBM, Accenture and Chainyard, while the two from China are Ant Financial, formerly known as Alibaba’s Alipay, and Beijing Peersafe Technology.      Four months before the Hyperledger announcement, Peersafe raised a series C funding from Shanghai Civil Military Integration Development Fund, which invests in dual-use technologies that could be used for both civilian and military purposes.      As the fund injected cash in the firm, Peersafe has fully embraced that partnership which could foster a deeper connection with its clients in the military and government agencies.      Founded in 2014 and one of the top three firms in terms of blockchain patents, with 14 approved and 55 pending as of June 2019, Peersafe provides infrastructure for blockchain-based platforms across China, including those created for the government.      Peersafe claims to be the only Chinese firm that has all three government-issued qualifications: the Commercial Cryptography Product Category Certificate, Sales Permit of Information Security Products for the Ministry of Public Security and Software Supplier for Central Government Agencies.      But its involvement in the military side has been largely unexplored until now.       The new certification program has qualified Peersafe for Hyperledger Fabric, a distributed ledger technology intended as a foundation for developing applications such as a logistics tracking platform and a secured information system.    Military use cases      Peersafe helped revamp a blockchain-based trade finance platform that has more than $53 billion transaction volume since its launch in January 2018 for China Construction Bank, one of the four major state-owned banks in the country. But its biggest applications for China could be for strengthening government control of the military.    Peersafe has already assistedhttp://www.peersafe.cn/product/jiankong.html Chinese police to secure footage and data transmission in its surveillance systems via trusted nodes, while providinghttp://www.peersafe.cn/product/baomi.html encrypted communication services for the government.    The official mouthpiece for the military, PLA Daily, detailed a plan in how to leverage blockchain technologies to enhance military management and national defence.      According to a report published this month, the Chinese armed forces would use blockchain technologies to secure classified information and communications, evaluate military training performances and monitor logistics.      For example, the system could be used to automatically submit shooting records onto a blockchain along with each soldier’s identity and timestamp of the training, and increase the reliability of the results.      Citing IBM and Samsung’s blockchain-based logistics platform, the PLA Daily report said the army could also better manage its logistics with lower cost on a blockchain-based platform.      The smart contract protocol could build “technical trust” and secure peer-to-peer communications where people from different departments can collaborate without approvals from higher levels, the report said.      Adding to the military blockchain projects now being undertaken globally, Peersafe’s alliance with the Chinese army and security apparatus is likely to deepen as more applications of the technology are developed and applied to its use cases.     War chest    The private equity fund that bought into Peersafe is part of Shanghai Guosheng Group, a state-owned investment company with over $7 billion assets under management.      The state-owned investment giant set up the fund in 2017 amid Chinese president Jinping Xi’s push for civil-military technology integrations after he established and took the helm of the Central Civil-Military Integration Development Committee.      One of the committee’s goals is to look for technologies that could be used for national defense and information security services in the military, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA).      According to a report from the National Defense University titled Chairman Xi Remakes the PLA: Assessing Chinese Military Reforms:      “China’s impetus for pursuing CMI (Civil-Military Integrations) as a core component of its PLA reforms is in large part a result of its reckoning with modern technology-driven warfare.”      The report indicated the civil-military integration initiatives could reduce China’s military budget as the nation is challenged by the recent slowing economic growth.      When announcing the Shanghai Guosheng Group investment in June, Peersafe’ CEO Ting Yan said, “Existing use cases across different sectors and special qualifications in the industry have laid a solid foundation for the firm to expand into the military security industry.”      “The fund will bring Peersafe a range of resources, including use cases for the military and state-owned enterprises,” Yan said. “Peersafe and the fund can benefit from shared brand effect, technologies, distribution networks and client base.”     Army printer toner cartridges protected by blockchain cryptography    The extent of the blockchain universe opening up to Peersafe via the Chinese army is evidenced by the case of the printer toner cartridges developed through cryptography that’s led a merger of what could be the first profitable blockchain developer in the country.      Hengjiu Technology, a toner cartridge producer for printers, has a long-running partnership with the PLA to prevent eavesdropping bugs from entering this overlooked backdoor.      Hengjiu borrowed heavily to pay $20 million for 71% of Minbo Information Technology, an information security and cryptography firm that’s been serving the Chinese army and other government security agencies for a decade, according to an equity transfer announcement filed with the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.      Military and government will be two of the driving forces for information security industry, Minbo said in its recent annual reports.      In its 2016 annual report, Minbo said it was certified to build a quality control platform from military weapons and, according to its 2017 annual report, by the Fujian National Administration for Protection of State Secrets to repair or destroy computers and paper-based medium.      Mionbo is applying to serve the government and military projects that include higher levels of classified information, according to Chinese news reports, as well as already holding top qualifications from government authorities including the State Cryptography Administration.      In the acquisition filing, Minbo said it aims to make over $28 million net profit in the next six years, with at least $2 million net profit for 2019. According to a Chinese media report, it could become the first firm that makes a profit in that range in the blockchain industry as military contracts boost the bottom line.     A blockchain arms race    Blockchain for military uses is not spoken about loudly, but already pervasive outside China. The U.S. and Russia are also on the lookout for such technologies to improve their armies’ capabilities.      The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the research arm of the U.S. Department of Defense, said in July it was starting to experiment with blockchain to secure communications and personnel data.      DARPA aims to create a more efficient and secure platform to allow personnel from anywhere to transmit messages or process transactions that can be traced through numerous channels of a decentralized ledger.      The application would be used in different ways, including facilitating communication between units and headquarters, and transmitting information between intelligence officers and the Pentagon, the agency said.      DARPA also has been trying to develop an unhackable code—which blockchain could facilitate—because the technology offers intelligence on hackers who try to break into secure databases, it added.      According to a March blog post by blockchain software company ConsenSys, the Russian Ministry of Defense is launching a research lab to analyze how blockchain technology can be used to mitigate cybersecurity attacks and support military operations.      One of the priorities of the lab is the development of an intelligent system to detect and prevent cyber-attacks on important databases and weapons systems, the report said, citing the Russian daily newspaper Izvestia.      The report warned the U.S. and other western militaries about the rise of blockchain adoptions in the Chinese and Russian armies.      “It is critical for the future integrity of our key weapons systems and national security assets that we act now rather than waiting for a crisis to alert us to the dangers of cyber-attack on non-blockchain defended systems.”",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/11/18/chinese-armys-blockchain-provider-approved-for-new-hyperledger-certification-program,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f6a5000eb8adebf254ba3dc217da5e0a21540f71-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383012,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9timx,1574069400,Visa R&D Arm Develops a Blockchain System That Could Replace Financial Data Aggregators,"The Takeaway  The research arm of payment card giant Visa has published a paper describing the development of LucidiTEE, a blockchain system for orchestrating sensitive data among multiple parties.  For example, the paper outlines a system that would allow banks and fintech applications to share data without relying on intermediary data aggregators.  While Europe has relied on legislation like GDPR to set standards for securely sharing customer data, US banks had to develop agreements with data aggregators.    Visa, the world’s largest card payment network, has been quietly developing a blockchain system that could upend how banks transfer customer transaction data to consumer financial applications like Mint and Credit Karma.       In a paper published by Visa’s research and development arm, researchers describe a system called LucidiTEE. It outlines a system for sharing sensitive personal data on a blockchain, crunching that data within a trusted execution environment (TEE) and using history-based policies to ensure that each of the parties receive an output of the computation. (The system’s name is a combination of TEE and the word lucidity).       The first application of LucidiTEE is sharing data between customers and financial apps. Such a configuration might spell trouble for aggregators like Plaid, Envestnet Yodlee, Finicity, according to people familiar with Visa’s thinking.       LucidiTEE could also allow banks to share data to train machine learning algorithms for tackling fraud or keep financial data tracking apps from selling anonymized customer data to tech giants like Google.       Visa did not respond to multiple requests for comment.       The paper, published on the Cryptology Eprint Archive, describes LucidiTEE as “the first system to enable multiple parties to jointly compute on large-scale private data, while guaranteeing policy-compliance even when the input providers are offline, and fairness to all output recipients.”       Visa was a founding member of the Libra Association until it dropped out right before the association launched. The financial services giant has also experimented with a blockchain-based business-to-business payment service originally developed alongside blockchain startup Chain. It is designed to perform international business transfers without the help of a typically slow correspondent banking network.       Visa Research produces work for the entire security and cryptography community, so the research could be taken up by a rival firm. But Visa can profit off of the intellectual property in the future.       The system was tested on Tendermint and Hyperledger Fabric, both available in the public domain. But it can also be used on a forkless public blockchain using a proof-of-stake consensus system, like those on Algorand or Ethereum 2.0, which is scheduled to arrive next year.       The trouble with aggregators    While the paper is undergoing a peer review process and is subject to changes, it illustrates Visa’s desire–like most large financial firms–to be able to not have customer data touching multiple different companies and to allow consumers to get closer to controlling their data.       Fintech apps have encouraged banks to work with third-party data aggregators to pull, clean and normalize financial transaction data from customers. The philosophy of the “open banking” movement is for banks to share data with fintech apps offering services direct to consumers.       Data aggregators have become a key part of the banking system because millions of consumers are using applications like budget tracker Mint, micro-investing tool Acorns and peer-to-peer payment app Venmo. San Francisco-based Plaid, the largest of these aggregators valued at around $2.56 billion, powers several personal financial apps, as well as cryptocurrency exchanges Gemini and Coinbase, to be able to access consumers’ financial data.       Data aggregation startups popped up as an alternative to screen scraping, where customers would give fintech applications sensitive login credentials for those apps to then scrape customer transaction data, said Brian Knight, senior research fellow in the Financial Markets Working Group with the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.       Banks were still reluctant to share information with aggregators until the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act which required financial institutions to make consumers’ records available in an electronic format. Aggregators argued they were the consumer’s agent. The U.S. Treasury Department sided with the aggregators in a recent fintech report, but the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau hasn’t commented on the issue, Knight said.       In place of regulation like Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), banks and data aggregators have formed informal and formal agreements about how the aggregators would handle customer data. Banks are selective about this process, however. When two parties differ on data-sharing standards, banks have been known to cut off aggregators, stopping customers from accessing financial apps.       For LucidiTEE to work in the customer transaction data space, the industry would also need to adopt a common data categorizing standard that every entity would need to follow. In deciding whether or not to take the leap, banks would need to weigh the cost of sticking with data aggregators or integrating into a new system, according to Knight.       “Part of the problem with blockchain adoption is that it seeks to remove intermediaries, and while intermediaries can charge rent, they can also add value,” Knight said.     'Granular control'    After reviewing Visa’s paper, Salt Lake City-based data aggregator Finicity said the proposed system would not provide the level of service that data aggregators provide today.       “It is simple when described as an exchange of data, but when you layer on the multitude of use cases, data intelligence, variances in data, security, privacy, regulation and more, it becomes much more sophisticated,” Nick Thomas, co-founder of Finicity, said in an email.       Thomas said that Finicity, a founding steward of the ID-focused Sovrin Foundation, is looking at blockchain for data privacy, however.       “It is always about giving consumers more granular and secure control over their financial data, and doing so in a way that they can be more informed and make smarter financial decisions,” Thomas said.       LucidiTEE enforces history-based policies–similar to smart contracts but with the ability to read the entire blockchain. That ensures that, even when users are offline, their information is not computed in a way they did not authorize.       The paper assumes a “malicious setting.” The system it describes uses protocols to ensure outputs are sent to every party has been given access to outputs. The blockchain would act like an escrow account where users would put the policy they’d like to enable, like sharing encrypted data to Mint in return for charts showing where the consumers spent money.       According to the paper, LucidiTEE’s blockchain ensures the trusted execution environment -- an encrypted domain where computers crunch sensitive data -- only does certain computations. In this way, the company holding the TEE can’t tamper with it, and every party on LucidiTEE doesn’t have to run a TEE.       The ledger then stores all cryptographic hash digests of encrypted inputs and outputs as well as what functions were run, for history-based protocols to review when the next computation is done.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/11/18/visa-rd-arm-develops-a-blockchain-system-that-could-replace-financial-data-aggregators,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5475081d5783a136ac76c08c7d8e29cbd8853b8b-1200x797.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383019,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tiqj,1574067000,This Tiny Crypto Startup Has Lessons for Libra's 'Unbanked' Dreams,"This is the latest in a series of ICO Followups examining the aftermath of the 2017 token boom.      Out of dozens of token projects that supposedly aimed to offer financial services like remittances to the unbanked, Bitspark is one of the few still fully operational today.      If Facebook’s Libra project truly aims to serve the globe’s 1.7 billion unbanked, the Hong Kong-based Bitspark might offer some insights.      Bitspark was founded in 2014 and raised $1.3 million worth of cryptocurrency in a 2017 initial coin offering (ICO), according to co-founder Maxine Ryan. To date, the remaining crypto has appreciated to $2.8 million worth of bitcoin and other assets.      One factor that makes Bitspark unique among surviving token projects is that it was originally a bitcoin-centric project that switched to the open-source BitShares blockchain for quick scaling (Most of Bitspark’s $2.8 million in reserves is in BitShares’ BTS token, for instance). Unlike ethereum, BitShares co-founder Dan Larimer is no longer actively focused on this blockchain and it is primarily maintained by volunteers.      As such, BitShares had some of the benefits of being a public ecosystem, like bitcoin, yet also wasn’t too big to work on scaling solutions with Bitspark when the startup migrated to that technology on the back-end.    Slow growth    So far, Ryan said most of Bitspark’s expenditure has been on staff (a team of 20) and operations, not marketing or community grants like many other token projects.    Bitspark currently operates in Hong Kong, the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam. Ryan said the startup plans to expand in 2020 beyond its two current cash-for-crypto centers in Hong Kong and 35 in the Philippines, thanks to a deal with the fast-food chain Calimex (Bitspark refers to these locations as “ cash pointshttps://www.bitspark.io/become-a-cash-point”).    “While it's still in the early stages of the launch phase, we have seen a meaningful uptick of 3–5 percent in transactions,” Calimex owner Jordan Moss told CoinDesk. “Becoming a Bitspark cash point has opened up the opportunity for a new revenue stream as well as facilitating cross-selling with Bitspark’s members and the crypto community in general. While coming in to use the cash point, we encourage customers to stay and enjoy a burrito or a margarita.”      Moss, who says he doesn’t own any crypto and wasn’t involved with the industry prior, added an important point about Bitspark’s focus on cash.      “Bitspark makes the complex easy for non-crypto businesses and people who are seeking to get into the space,” he said.      Indeed, Bitspark uses the token for a traditional points-based rewards program, which allows the user to cash out those ZEPH tokens for bitcoin or use them for transaction fees. There are some unbanked users able to use Bitspark services, but they are not the profit driver this startup relies on.      “Our services are available not only to the unbanked but as an alternative to existing financial services generally,” Ryan said.      Co-founder George Harrap told CoinDesk that, like several other startups who still have several years of runway since the 2017 bull market, Bitspark is able to make a small profit because it doesn’t base its revenue model on the ZEPH token. Furthermore, he said Bitspark processes transactions and currency swaps on the backend, using the BitShares decentralized exchange (DEX).      “In any of our conversations with customers, it's there in the background doing its thing,” he said of ZEPH. “It’s an added incentive for customers to use our products, but the value to them should be in the product first and foremost, not the token.”      One such user, Japanese professor Fujita Kazuhisa, tried Bitspark during a trip to Hong Kong. He told CoinDesk he bought a tiny amount of bitcoin back in 2015, and has a high level of technical knowledge, but doesn’t consider himself a “crypto” person. He is, as Crypto Twitter might say, a relatively normal person who is not routinely active in “the space.”      “I think Bitspark is unique in the sense they are using a DEX and a stablecoin backed by BitShares’ collateral system as the gateway to offer their crypto remittance service,” Kazuhisa said. “Their service is well designed to make it easier to use [than a DEX]. But ... emerging fintech remittance companies, who rely on fund settlement in the traditional finance networks … may still be more efficient and easier to use.”      In short, he’s curious about the company and might use it again in the future, although he doesn’t rely on it for routine needs.    Lessons for Facebook    This BitShares user experience highlights some of the common themes across token projects that have yet to fail.    They serve small groups of tech-savvy users, utilize a hybrid business model that is primarily traditional even though it includes proverbial “token economics.” (In Bitspark’s case, the exchange aspects are primarily on the back-end.) Bitspark also raised a small and undisclosed amount from the traditional venture firm Reinsurance Group of Americahttps://www.bitspark.io/blog-posts/spark-secures-funding-from-reinsurance-group-of-america via an incubator program.    For Facebook, which has opted to try to foster its own blockchain ecosystem rather than use bitcoin or another established technology, this could create governance and upkeep challenges that Bitspark didn’t have to overcome. To the contrary, Bitspark switched to the BitShares blockchain and found a rare crypto community with both a power vacuum and a working exchange with relatively reliable liquidity. Unlike zcash or ethereum, for example, other startups weren’t already occupying the brand awareness associated with the BitShares blockchain.      Bitspark found a balance between open-source collaboration, with BitShares volunteers, and the independent ability to tweak, deploy and execute features for the startup’s proprietary services. Facebook will need to blaze its own path toward the same goal if it aims to truly foster an open ecosystem.      Doing this at scale – well beyond the mere hundreds of participants involved with Bitspark’s ecosystem – would be ambitious at best. Plus, as if that wasn’t complicated enough, any lack of cash on-ramps would be an issue for any unbanked users.      “The bottlenecks aren’t blockchain scalability, the real bottleneck is between the real world and the virtual world,” said a Bitspark user who works in the crypto sector. “I’ve both bought bitcoin and sold bitcoin at the cash points [in Hong Kong]. … The whole process took me about seven minutes, which is a little longer than it should take.”      This user, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that Bitspark is ""still at an early stage"" of user adoption. ""The most resilient of all the bridges will be cash, paper bridges.”    The Bitspark user has a bank account, but added that anyone can arrive in Hong Kong and use the service to transact locally regardless. This applies to corporate users as well as the individuals that companies serve. For example, the power company Okra Solarhttps://www.bitspark.io/blog-posts/bitspark-roadmap-update-april-2019-the-month-of-milestones has used Bitspark to settle cash transactions on the blockchain in the rural Philippines, Ryan said, by using the Bitspark mobile app.    “The unbanked experience a starkly different reality to what Facebook's Libra portrays it as,” Ryan said. “This is apparent by their members – where there isn't a single consideration for cash settlement. … If [Libra] did [understand], they would have members like Western Union who do service the unbanked with cash settlement as the focus.”      Maxine Ryan and George Harrap image via Bitspark",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TOKEN SALE,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/11/18/this-tiny-crypto-startup-has-lessons-for-libras-unbanked-dreams,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/528feed58167eae531b945a951ca26ddb1591723-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
