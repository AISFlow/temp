42399643,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAblsvH,1487286608,"Is Bitcoin Forming a New Price Floor at $1,000?","Bitcoin appears to be stabilizing at a new price point.  The value of tokens on the public blockchain protocol reached a high of $1,039 today, continuing their recent run of stability. At press time, bitcoin has been trading above $1,000 since mid-day on 14th February, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  Yet, while promising, the digital currency may need to spend more time above this level before it becomes a new support, analysts told CoinDesk.  Tim Enneking, chairman of digital asset hedge fund Crypto Asset Management, projected that if the market stays above $1,000 for the next few days, support at this level could be more plausible.  Still, he indicated he expects momentum will build around this point.  ""I'd be astonished if we fell below $1,000 barring any external event,"" he said.  Vinny Lingham, former Bitcoin Foundation board member and CEO of identity startup Civic, however, voiced doubts about whether bitcoin could build support above the $1,000 mark.  ""It certainly could, but I think it's unlikely,"" he told CoinDesk.  Lingham has previously predicted that the digital currency will consolidate around $1,000 for the next month or two, clarifying today that he believes bitcoin prices will ""for the most part"" fluctuate within $50 of this level.  Petar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged cryptocurrency trading platform Whaleclub, also emphasized that this price does not represent a ""huge support level"", but he was optimistic about the general trajectory.  ""The more time price spends above $1,000, the stronger that support level becomes,"" he said.    One upcoming test, he said, will be if the price declines to retest the $1,000 level, and bounces back above it, providing evidence of support, and potentially, a sign the market could further strengthen.

42399646,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAblstJ,1487269226,Austrian Utility Giant Trials Blockchain Energy Trading,"Wien Energie, Austria’s largest utility conglomerate, is taking part in a new blockchain trial focused on energy trading.  The conglomerate is working with Vancouver-based BTL Group, as well as EY’s Austrian outfit, on the project. The firm, according to its website, provides power to more than two million people, as well as thousands of industrial and agricultural customers in Austria.  In statements, Wien Energie indicated that it wanted to explore new avenues for tracking energy assets, with the aim of reducing the cost of doing so. The trial is expected to last three months, from March to May of this year.  Wien Energie CEO Michael Strebl said in a statement:  ""Blockchain technology is a further digitization trend in the energy industry. As Austria's largest energy service provider, we want to actively make use of the technology and its chances for our customers and us.""  The first publicly acknowledged blockchain trial for Wien Energie, representatives said that it would consider whether the solutions developed are commercially viable, though there’s no clear timeline as to when any products based on blockchain might be released.  It’s also the latest signal from the energy industry about its interest in blockchain.  Germany-based RWE has been testing ethereum for various use cases, partnering last year with startup Slock.it, the firm behind the now-defunct DAO project. Ethereum has also been leveraged by other startups looking to retool how energy can be traded.  And while not focused specifically on the energy trade, the US Department of Energy began soliciting research proposals related to the tech in January.

42399629,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAblsgW,1487261720,Commonwealth Bank Plans More Blockchain Investments in 2017,"One of Australia’s ‘Big Four’ banks has committed to further blockchain investments as it steps up its overall IT spend.  ZDNet  reports that Commonwealth Bank is looking to spend close to $1bn – an increase over last year – on technology in 2017. While published investor documents contain no hard numbers, the bank has reportedly pledged to continue investing in blockchain over the coming year.  The disclosure comes weeks after Commonwealth Bank said it was involved with a ""cryptobond"" blockchain project in collaboration with the Queensland Treasury Corporation (QTC), utilizing CBA’s capital markets platform to streamline the underwriting and settlement process for debt instruments. Traders using the system have access to a transparent order book where they can see bids for the bonds in real time.  Commonwealth Bank, one of the four largest institutions of its kind in Australia, has been working with the tech since mid-2015. It made headlines last October when the firm, in partnership with Wells Fargo, collaborated on a blockchain-focused trade finance project, specifically centered on the global cotton market.  The development comes amid a broader push toward blockchain among Australia’s finance space – as well as interest from regulators, who have expressed interest in the past in both bitcoin and blockchain-focused frameworks.

42399636,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAblsmQ,1487260076,Coin.mx Bitcoin Exchange Trial Begins in New York,"Despite a slight delay, the trial of two individuals tied to the now-defunct bitcoin exchange Coin.mx has commenced.  Reuters  reports that representatives for Yuri Lebedev, one of the operators of the failed exchange, and Trevon Gross, a pastor who once ran a credit union allegedly involved in the scheme, portrayed their clients as unwitting accomplices, pointing the finger largely at Anthony Murgio, who plead guilty to several charges in January.  Coin.mx was a bitcoin exchange based in Florida which operated as a so-called “Collectible’s Club”. The government has alleged that Coin.mx used this structure to obscure its exchange activities, asserting that the service was leveraged as part of a broader cybercrime ring tied to a series of 2014 hackings, including one attack on Wall Street giant JPMorgan.  The trial was delayed briefly during jury selection after the prosecution pushed for a new witness. That request was ultimately denied by Judge Alison Nathan.  During opening remarks, attorneys for the federal government highlighted the bribe allegedly given to Gross, who was charged last month.  ""The bribes and lies had a simple, shared purpose: For the defendants Lebedev and Gross and their co-conspirators to make money,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Won Shin was quoted as saying.  By contrast, attorneys for Gross and Lebedev argued that their clients largely didn’t know what they were getting into.  “Yuri was in the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong people,” Eric Creizman, who is representing Lebedev in the case, told the jury.

42399628,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAblsfX,1487255111,Why Bigger Might Not Be Better For Bitcoin Scaling,"The block size debate, long one of the defining challenges hanging over bitcoin's tech community, took an interesting twist late last month.      A years-long discussion about how best to scale the functioning $15bn economic network mid-flight, the debate has largely been characterized by a face-off between those who would increase the 1MB block size via an efficiency improvement called SegWit, and those who want to change the hard-coded block size limit to 2MB or more.      You'll notice that, so far, neither side has called for a block size decrease.      But that was exactly the view represented in a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) submitted to the bitcoin-dev mailing list by Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr, in a message titled ""Three hardfork related BIP’s"".      Specifically, Dashjr’s proposal suggested a temporary block size reduction to 300KB (dependent on the date that the BIP was activated), slowly rising in yearly increases to a limit of 31MB in 2045.      The timing of the proposal, released on 27th January, came just days after a huge increase in transaction backlog saw unconfirmed transactions spike to over 60,000 before returning to lower levels.      In a more detailed proposal, Dashjr cites the amount of disk space demanded by the blockchain – currently around 100GB – as a significant disincentive for anyone wanting to run a node, hardware that stores the full ledger history.      Dashjr writes:      ""It is a regular occurrence to see new users complain about the time to setup a node, and established members of the community recommending downgrading to non-full wallet software, which results in the new user gaining bitcoin as a currency, but not the security of bitcoin itself, and compromises the integrity of the network as a whole by widespread usage.""              The remarks are not surprising as the viability of bitcoin's node network has emerged as one of the more prominent political footballs in the debate.      Without a vibrant node network, developers fear that the operation of bitcoin's ledgers will fall into the hands of a few big operators, thus defeating the purpose of a decentralized payment network.    Cool reception    Although the proposed reduction is what has garnered most attention, the proposal actually calls for an annual block size increase of 17% per year, intended to keep pace with the growth rate in bandwidth seen in recent years.      But critics of the ensuing discussion have suggested that this figure is overly conservative, and that it does not account for the non-linear pace of technological change – especially when projected into the future.      In general, the proposal has seen little support from the wider community, with most responses on the mailing list expressing skepticism toward the proposal.      The block size decrease might not have been the sole point of contention, however. Dashjr's proposal requires what's called a hard fork, a way to upgrade a blockchain that can split the network if not all participants agree. (Even this definition, it seems, remains contentious).      Bitcoin Core contributor Johnson Lau responded to argue that neither a block size increase nor a decrease is desirable. ""For me, both approaches just show the lack of creativity, and lack of responsibility,"" he said.      He further expressed the common view that a hard fork would be too dangerous right now, adding:    ""The 1MB is here, no matter you like it or not, it’s the current consensus. Any attempts to change this limit (up or down) require wide consensus of the whole community, which might be difficult.""    This might explain why even a modified version of the proposal, which removed the block size decrease, released on 5th February by developer Andrew Chow, failed to generate enthusiasm from list members.    Some support    Discussing his proposal and the response with CoinDesk, Dashjr cited a Twitter poll that showed 20% support for a block size decrease – far from a majority, but a large enough number to merit serious consideration.      However, he also pointed out the difficulty of moving forward with modifications to the network when a supermajority of hashing power is required to accept them.      He said:      ""Many seemed to think seven years before the increases began was too far out. A poll showed the majority would prefer it sooner. But that same poll shows that 10% oppose any hard fork that increases the block size limit ever – which basically kills any chance of such a proposal gaining consensus.""              In light of the community's response, Dashjr said that he did not intend to develop the BIP draft any further at the present time, and would not be pursuing it to the point of receiving an official proposal number.      If there really is 20% support for a reduction in block size, though, some of Dashjr's ideas may still reemerge through other channels in future.

According to local news outlets, the State Bank of India – which Fortune says held nearly $450bn in assets as of last year – is partnering with several technology firms and a group of domestic commercial banks on a new initiative dubbed ‘Bankchain’.  IBM and Microsoft will reportedly be providing technical assistance for the group as it explores ways to leverage blockchain to reduce fraud and improve operational efficiency.  IBM has previously announced partnerships with Indian companies focused on blockchain development. Primechain Technologies, a blockchain startup based in Mumbai, is also said to be working on the Bankchain project.

42399642,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAblssK,1487249114,China's BTCC Becomes Latest Bitcoin Exchange to Freeze Withdrawals,"Shanghai-based bitcoin exchange BTCC has announced that it will halt bitcoin and other cryptocurrency withdrawals for one month.  The news, posted to its website today, comes one week after Huobi and OKCoin, two of the country's 'Big Three' exchanges alongside BTCC, revealed they would prohibit cryptocurrency withdrawals as part of an effort to combat money laundering at the request of China's central bank.  At the time, BTCC said it would undertake a similar upgrade, but that it would only take 72 hours to complete.  According to the update, however, BTCC plans to continue the audit of its system, with the goal of ending the process on 15th March.  The statement reads:  ""After the upgrade of the industry and the completion of the audit system, the bitcoin and litecoin currency will be back to normal. If the system upgrade can be completed ahead of time, all business will return to normal immediately.""  The announcement comes on the heels of a decline in volume across China-based exchanges, and an apparent exodus of domestic traders to alternative platforms.  Data from Bitcoinity shows the sharp reduction in volume over the last 30 days, spurred by exchange policy changes requested by the People's Bank of China (PBoC) beginning in January.    Likewise, data from Bitcoin Charts indicates volume at BTCC has declined in recent weeks.  Muted reaction  At the time of reporting, the market seemed apathetic about the news, with bitcoin prices trending higher for the day across US dollar and Chinese yuan markets.  CNY prices were up 8%, though as reported by CoinDesk, local traders are no longer confident that domestic exchange prices reflect the true cost of the asset.  Overall, most are suggesting that announcements will continue as China grapples with its rule-making for bitcoin more broadly.  Zennon Kapron, author of ""Chomping at the Bitcoin: The Past, Present and Future of Bitcoin in China"", suggested the domestic industry will likely be in for a long road of changes.  ""In the end, these exchanges need to be connected to and sharing data with PBoC's SAFE,"" he said. ""That would give them the surveillance to ensure that people aren't moving more than their yearly $50,000 limit of money out and cover any AML concerns.""  He suggested that this could be one possible long-term solution, and potentially, a way to illustrate that bitcoin is not as widely used for capital flight as feared.

42399645,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAblswG,1487248246,Swift Reveals Future Global Payment Tech – Blockchain Not Included,"After months of testing, Swift, the interbank payments platform that connects 11,000 global banks, has formally launched the system it believes will be the future of its cross-border payments services.  And notably absent was any integration with blockchain or distributed ledger technology.  As part of the formal rollout, Swift (or the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) revealed that 12 of the world's largest banks have been conducting real-time transactions via its Global Payments Innovation (GPI) project for some months.  Although Swift plans to continue its experiments with blockchain for other applications, GPI program director Wim Raymaekers told CoinDesk that its cross-border payments solution demonstrates the efficiencies possible using more traditional alternatives.  He said:  ""It is there today. We can improve it over time, all the time, it’s a continuous improvement.""  As of early this morning, initial GPI users – a group that includes the Bank of China, BBVA, Citi, ING Bank and Standard Chartered – will have conducted ""tens of thousands of transactions"" between 60 country corridors, Raymaekers said.  Instead of rebuilding Swift's cross-border payments infrastructure from scratch, the GPI has been constructed as a set of business rules encoded on top of the existing infrastructure with an eye to increasing speed, transparency and the traceability of transactions.  On top of those rules, Swift has further created a transaction tracking mechanism supported by cloud computing, with a graphical user interface designed to show exactly where a payment will be, should it get held up.  Participating banks will be able to add a widget to their websites to activate the feature, Raymaekers said.  Other banks that are now using the system – which has been live since January – include ABN AMRO, DBS Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Intesa Sanpaolo, Nordea Bank and UniCredit.  Blockchain savings  Although the cost of the service is not being made public, Raymaekers shared with CoinDesk the potential savings attributed to another of the GPI's possible future services, which is yet to be implemented.  In January, Swift revealed it had commenced work on a blockchain proof-of-concept (PoC) to test whether the 'nostro and vostro' accounts common to banking could be simplified using technology from the Linux-led Hyperledger project.  To measure whether the blockchain PoC will be successful, Swift is analyzing the security and privacy of transaction data, and whether new and deeper types of account liquidity data can be captured.  ""That’s why we’re looking for banks with a strong liquidity practice to come to the proof of concept,"" Raymaekers said.  Swift’s push to modernize cross-border payments, however, is part of a bigger movement around the world to make it easier and cheaper to send money. While Swift's service is aimed at making it cheaper for banks, rivals are looking to blockchain to help cut the banks out altogether.  At stake is nothing less than a slice of global remittance market estimated by the World Bank to be worth $552bn for the past two years.  To capture a piece of that transaction volume, some well-funded bitcoin startups have set their sights square on cross-border payments, including Align Commerce and Abra, two startups that have raised $20.25m and $14m, respectively.  But perhaps no blockchain startup has more at stake than Ripple, which has raised $93m from Standard Chartered, Accenture Ventures and others to streamline cross-border payments.  Sugar and medicine  But even as Raymaekers positions his technology as a means to modernize cross-border payments without blockchain, he said Swift is looking to see how the system might further explore the technology.  This October, as part of Swift's annual Sibos conference, blockchain developers will be given access directly to the GPI as part of a hackathon, Raymaekers revealed to CoinDesk.  ""We're going to open those APIs for fintech and blockchain designers to come up with ... new ideas,"" he said.  By the time the hackathon kicks off, Raymaekers expects that more of the 100 banks that have so far signed up for GPI will go live with real transactions, some as early as May. Further, he indicated that if the nostro-vostro blockchain PoC is successful, it is scheduled to go live sometime in 2019.  Overall, while Raymaekers is optimistic about the possibility that blockchain might improve some products, he ultimately sees the need for the tech as limited.  He concluded:  ""We think blockchain today is not ready for wholesale cross-border payments. We are improving that with GPI, so it’s no longer a problem.""

42399647,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAblsyE,1487209575,Crypto Traders Flock to Altcoins Amid Bitcoin Price Malaise,"With many crypto traders sitting on the sidelines and awaiting news from China, volumes for bitcoin, the market's most highly traded asset, have seen a decline.  Market participants traded 6,670 bitcoins through Bitfinex, one of the world's largest exchanges by volume, in the 24 hours through roughly 21:30 UTC today, more than 50% less than the daily average of 17,900 bitcoins over the last week.  Likewise, volume has declined at major Chinese exchanges Huobi, OKCoin and BTCC, all exchanges whose policies have been affected by directives from that country's central bank.  Against this backdrop, bitcoin's price has stabilized, fluctuating between a daily high of $1,011 reached at 01:15 UTC and a session low of $1,001.00 hit at 07:00 UTC, CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  The 14th February session provided a similar story, as bitcoin prices moved within a slightly larger range between $987.33 and $1,106.44, additional BPI figures reveal.  The rangebound trading that bitcoin has experienced may form part of a broader trend, according to Vinny Lingham, market analyst and CEO of identity startup Civic.  Lingham told CoinDesk:  ""I expect bitcoin to consolidate around $1,000 for a while, maybe a month or even two.""  While some might embrace such a period of lower volatility, this reduction in price movement also results in fewer opportunities for traders to profit from the cryptocurrency's price swings.  Alternatives emerge  But while bitcoin's market has settled, many other cryptographic assets have received tailwinds from the development.  At the time of report, eight out of the top 10 cryptocurrencies on CoinMarketCap (listed in terms of market capitalization) were higher for the day, with monero and dash having experienced the most notable gains.  Monero, a token that powers a blockchain that leverages digital signatures to help preserve the privacy of its users, rose to $13.74 during the session, more than 5.6% higher than the currency's price of $13.01 at 12:04 UTC, CoinMarketCap figures reveal.  At the time of report, monero's token, XMR, was trading at $13.61, 4.6% higher for the session.  Data provided by cryptocurrency trading platform Whaleclub shows the benefit that this particular altcoin has derived as a result of traders' lack of interest in bitcoin.  ""We've seen lower volume (both shorts and longs) in the past few days on BTC/USD, with traders moving on to other markets which offer greater volatility,"" Petar Zivkovski, COO for Whaleclub, told CoinDesk.  He singled out monero's XMR token in particular, indicating that ""we see some volume flocking"" to this privacy-oriented digital currency.  Dash, a digital currency that offers users privacy and instant transactions, also pushed higher in 15th February. The cryptocurrency climbed to $19.66 during the session, 8.6% higher than the currency’s price of $18.10 at 12:04 UTC, according to CoinMarketCap.  At the time of report, dash had fallen to $19.23, representing a 6.2% increase for the day.  Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Asset Management, offered similar sentiment.  ""We are also moving a bit of money into altcoins,"" he told CoinDesk.
