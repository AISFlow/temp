42429132,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrxvh,1527714009,Headphones Maker Monster Is Quietly Planning A $300 Million ICO,"Monster Products, Inc. has been losing money for years, but a $300 million initial coin offering (ICO) may be what it takes to turn the company around.  Founded in 1978, Monster, which makes electronic accessories such as headphones and Bluetooth speakers, has primarily relied on retailers to distribute its goods up to now. Business issues aside, though, Monster doesn't appear to be cutting back on its ambitions for making a change.  According to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Monster is planning to run one of the biggest ICOs of all time by selling ""monster money tokens"" to build the ""Monster Money Network,"" a new e-commerce site for selling its products (and potentially those of other companies) online.  If it succeeds in raising its target amount, Monster will use the funds to make the Monster Money Network a platform for purchasing its products using ethereum tokens.  The ICO fits into a larger trend in the token space of existing companies that have struggled with their revenue model pivoting to blockchain in an attempt to attain profitability. In the past, pre-existing tech companies with venture backing have launched ICOs (Listia and YouNow), but this is the first longstanding consumer product to do so.  As part of the plan, Monster will create 500 million tokens and sell as many as 300 million in its offering. The offering will run for one year, unless it sells out sooner or it decides to cancel the sale early. The company is also issuing 75 million shares of common stock so that, if the network fails to launch, it can exchange every four tokens for one share of stock (in lieu of returning the money).  Notably, the token does not come with equity or voting rights. Instead, it's designed as a payment method for the e-commerce website (under construction), one with faster settlement and lower fees than existing payments rails. (Still, the filing acknowledges that this might not be enough to prevent it from running afoul of securities law.)  Nonetheless, Monster is also filing to take advantage of the ""emerging growth company"" designation under the Jobs Act, which provides for certain lighter disclosure requirements and broader investor solicitation rights.  Money for something  As for the network launch, Monster's filing offers a surprising amount of detail as far as such disclosures go.  For example, the filing states that the Monster Money Network will be used for ""for payment processing, market analysis, accounting, audit and payroll services, inventory management and shipping operation"" relating to Monster products sold online. From there, it hopes it can recruit other e-commerce platforms onto the network.  There will be a three-stage process for the product. In the first, it will simply be a payments system, using an ERC-20 token. In the next stage, it will lower or eliminate transaction costs by enabling micro-transactions off-chain.  In the final stage, it will transition to its own blockchain (Kik skipped straight to that last step recently).  As the filing explains:  ""In the future, Monster intends to leverage its global connections and brand visibility along with blockchain technology to bring more and more other e-commerce platforms onto Monster Money Network and expand the user base of MMNY Tokens. We hope to set up the blockchain standard for e-commerce platforms.""  The company has evolved a lot since its earliest days. According to its website, it began as Monster Cable because its founder, Noel Lee, had discovered that different kinds of cables produced different levels of audio fidelity. Capitalizing on this discovery, he launched a company that later expanded into other related products.  ""We primarily design, engineer, market and sell headphones, cables, docks, speakers, power products and mobile accessories,"" according to its filing, which argues that it has several advantages over its competitors in the industry, including brand recognition, a network of ambassadors and culture of innovation.  More than half the funds are designated for technical development of the network, but roughly one-third is earmarked for marketing (both the protocol and monster products) and developing relationships with partners who will sell Monster products.  Dire straits  In other words, it doesn't sound like the new tokens will ever be the only way to acquire Monster's headphones and cables, and it seems clear that the ICO is in no small part a strategy to give a multimillion-dollar boost to the product line's visibility.  So far, there hasn't been an example of a non-blockchain company moving into decentralized software from a position of strength, and Monster appears (at first glance) to be no different. Monster has been losing money for at least the last several years.  As its filing states:  ""The amount of future losses and when, if ever, we will achieve profitability are uncertain.""  At the end of last year, it had a net loss of $26.7 million, but it has already lost another $19.6 million in the first quarter of 2018, so the pace of losses appears to be accelerating.  The ICO is not the first measure the company has taken to turn it around. It has let go of staff, dropped products, cut its marketing budget and even closed a factory in Mexico. Nevertheless, the filing admits, ""Our independent auditors have indicated ... that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.""  Rather than give up, it has decided to raise $300 million to take on some of the most successful companies in history.  As its filing states:  ""We consider Amazon, Ebay and Alibaba as examples of our main competitors with respect to the new Monster Money Network and our existing e-commerce platform.""

The Zcash team first revealed details about Sapling back in February of last year, which is aimed at speeding up transactions on the network, as previously reported.  What's missing is an activation ""block height"" – essentially, the exact transaction block at which point the Sapling hard fork takes effect – and according to developers, this will be included in a future update.

42429135,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrxxh,1527698144,$30 Million Crypto Startup Fund Launched By Mobile Game Maker,"A maker of mobile games based in Japan has launched a $30 million investment fund focused on cryptocurrencies and blockchain.  Gumi is a maker and publisher of games, including titles such as Brave Frontier and Final Fantasy: Brave Exvius (on which it served as a collaborator along with Square-Enix and another firm, Alim).  The new fund, according to a report from VentureBeat, is being led by Gumi founder and CEO Hironao Kunimitsu as well as Miko Matsumura, the founder of the Evercoin cryptocurrency exchange. Law firm White & Case LLP advised on the fund's formation, according to a separate announcement.  ""We decided to create a fund that enables us to engage more directly with early-stage blockchain and cryptocurrency startups, in order to be more effective partners and have a real impact in the market,"" Kunimitsu told the publication in a statement.  And while the fund's debut is new, it's already made some investments in the space. These include stakes in Basis, the company behind one of several ""stablecoins,"" and – perhaps less surprisingly – Robot Cache, which is looking to build a blockchain-powered competitor to Steam, the gaming distribution platform.  Matsumura told GamesBeat that the fund would invest in both equity and tokens directly.  ""We like early stage. We invest in equity or tokens. We like financial services. We like game technologies, and we believe there is a strong connection between gaming and crypto,"" he was quoted as saying.  Whether that stronger confluence of gaming and blockchain comes to fruition remains to be seen, but other giants in the gaming ecosystem, including developer Ubisoft and gaming engine Unity, are eyeing the tech for potential applications.

42429148,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLryDh,1527694783,EOS Cryptocurrency Lacks Price Direction Ahead of Launch,"EOS' move from the ethereum blockchain to its own mainnet is just a couple of days away, yet its native cryptocurrency is looking indecisive on the price charts.  The cryptocurrency had rallied nearly 500 percent over the six-weeks to April 29 as the news of the mainnet launch revved up investor excitement. The broad-based rally across the wider cryptocurrency markets in April only added to the bullish sentiment.  Since May 24, however, EOS has been restricted to a narrow trading range of $10–$13, according to Bitfinex data.  The fizzling out of investor enthusiasm may be linked to the identification of security flaws in the EOS platform. On Tuesday, Qihoo 360, a China-based internet security firm, said it had informed developers of potentially serious vulnerabilities in the platform, which now appear to have been patched.  In response, the price of EOS fell from $12 to $10.70, but soon regained the lost ground alongside a $400 rally in bitcoin prices.  Further, the company's lack of responsiveness to issues such as general confusion over the voting procedure for block producers (validators) may have taken the shine off the June 2 launch for investors.  All that said, EOS is still up more than 200 percent from its March low of $3.87 and could shine against bitcoin in the near-term, the technical charts indicate.  EOS/USD daily chart  The above chart shows that EOS is stuck inside a falling channel – a bearish pattern. Further, its failure to retake the rising trendline on May 28 is an encouraging sign for the bears.  However, the outlook would turn bearish only below $10.33 – the low of last Thursday's bullish outside-day candle.  In such a case, EOS will likely find acceptance below the rising channel support (seen today at $9.60) and drop to $9.72 (76.4 percent Fibonacci retracement).  On the higher side, only a convincing move above the rising trendline hurdle (currently seen at $13.45) would revive the bullish outlook and open doors for $20.  While the EOS/USD market looks indecisive, its bitcoin-denominated exchange rate looks all set for a big move higher.  EOS/BTC daily chart  The bull flag breakout seen on April 24 signals a resumption of the rally from the April 17 low of $0.0010 BTC and has opened the doors to 0.0029 BTC (target as per the measured height method, i.e. pole height added to breakout price).  Only a move back inside the flag would abort the bullish view.

The thieves even claimed to have obtained security questions and answers, social insurance numbers and account balances, the report says.

42429143,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLry5h,1527681640,'Layer 2' Blockchain Tech Is an Even Bigger Deal Than You Think,"Michael J. Casey is chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor of blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      Welcome to the ""Layer 2"" era.  We are now entering an exciting new phase of blockchain development in which the lightning network and other programming solutions that operate ""on top"" of existing blockchains promise big strides in scalability, interoperability and functionality.  There is still much work to be done. The early tech is buggy, and new security and trust solutions must be figured out when much of the computing activity in individual transactions or smart contracts is taken ""off chain.""  But in mitigating the heavy, multi-party computation that blockchains carry while ensuring that transaction histories are at some point anchored by ""on-chain"" consensus algorithms, there's something of a best-of-both-worlds promise in these ideas.  As Neha Narula, director of the MIT Media Lab's Digital Currency Initiative (where I work) describes it, the defining feature of Layer 2 is that ""computation is moved off-chain, either to enable privacy or to save computing resources.""  Rather than having the script of a particular program executed by every computer in the blockchain network, it ""is implemented simply by the two or more computers involved in the transaction.""  And yet, she said, ""you get similar security protections as with on-chain transactions because the blockchain acts as the anchor of trust.""  Where this all goes is anyone's guess. That's what makes open-source, extensible platforms exciting: they provide the building blocks upon which unimaginable new applications can be developed.  We're not entirely driving blind, however. The development of the World Wide Web in the 1990s offers a useful source of contrast and comparison, when a similar, second layer solution transformed the Internet from being a clunky network of mostly academic users into a ubiquitous global phenomenon.  Similarly to then, I believe, we can expect an avalanche of innovation and development.  Laying foundations  Stepping back, the 1989 implementation of Tim Berners-Lee's Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) on top of the base-layer Transmission Control and Internet protocols (TCP/IP) paved the way for Marc Andreessen's Mosaic Netscape browser in 1994.  That then gave rise to a host of web-based applications, which ultimately fostered all the online services that now form part of everyday life.  In some respects, the sequencing will be different for the blockchain industry. We may already have had our version of the late-nineties dot.com bubble, for example, with last year's ICO mania coming before the enabling Layer 2 technologies were in place.  Still, a good amount of the billions raised in those token offerings will likely find its way into Layer 2 development, hopefully accelerating their march toward wider adoption.  Also, whereas HTTP was universally adopted as an almost immediate standard, there's a great deal of competition in Layer 2 blockchain solutions.  Lightning's payment channels were originally designed for bitcoin transactions, but it supports interoperability and has certain smart contract capability.  That could put it up against alternative ""state channel"" Layer 2 solutions for ethereum (Plasma, Raiden) as well as with projects aiming to enable cross-chain transactions (Polkadot, Cosmos, Interledger).  And, as seen at the L2 Summit hosted recently by MIT DCI and Fidelity Labs, there are many other lightweight off-chain ways to expand transactional capacity.  For example, developers at the startup Abra and elsewhere are using established, decentralized blockchains such as bitcoin and ethereum to settle futures contracts that are denominated in different currencies or tokens.  In bloom  Already more than 2,000 nodes are on the Lightning Network, managing more than 7,000 channels. It's a long way from being a ubiquitous global network, but that growing community provides a great foundation for experimentation.  Now that a unique form of privacy-protecting smart contracts has been developed by Tadge Dryja, a co-author of the original Lightning white paper and now also at the DCI, there's an even greater potential for development.  Layer 2 projects developed around ethereum are also generating interest. At the Event Horizon conference on blockchain energy in Berlin last month, much buzz was generated by presentations on the capacity of Polkadot and Slock.It's Incubed client to enable off-chain, device-to-device transactions.  Meanwhile, with Ripple joining the Hyperledger consortium, corporate engineers will have opportunities to develop enterprise uses for the startup's Interledger protocol.  In this environment, we will see a competitive dance pit the interests of established corporates against Layer 2 startups such as Lightning Labs, Blockstream, Ripple and Parity, as well as potentially hundreds of independent coders around the world.  Ultimately, standards will arise, creating winners, with consortia like the World Wide Web Consortium, better known as W3C, emerging to shepherd that process.  And what of the economic fallout from all this? If the nineties are a lesson, we can expect that, eventually, many legacy industries could be disrupted.  New frontier  Lightning's payment channels point to the kind of low-fee, fast-paced payments that bitcoin early on promised but failed to deliver. That would, in theory, take business away from banks, credit card companies and money transmitters.  Still, there's no guarantee regular Joes will get over their apprehension toward cryptocurrencies – not without as-yet-unavailable solutions for price volatility, for example.  There are also questions about how regulators will deal with a system that could make transactions very hard for them to track. Finally, it's still not clear that these off-chain solutions will achieve the kind of scale necessary without the emergence of powerful corporate interests.  Will such participants impose unwieldy costs on the system or simply provide much-needed liquidity? It's too early to say.  Another question is who will be the winners and losers in the crypto community. Might Layer 2 solutions deny miners the fees they need to continue securing the underlying blockchain? That was the topic of a recent Twitter exchange between Ryan Selkis and Jameson Lopp.  Here, the lessons from Wall Street in the late 1990s might also be instructive. Some investment banks worried about the hit to revenue as web-based e-trading slashed brokerage fees. In reality, online technology expanded the pie for stock market trading, benefiting incumbent players even as their per-trade margins shrank. It was an example of what's known as the Jevons Paradox.  History doesn't always repeat, of course. Miners may indeed be hurt by activity going off chain. But it shouldn't be our job to worry about them per se.  The goal here, as clearly defined in the Segwit debate that ultimately resulted in lightning's implementation on the bitcoin main-net, is for optimal decentralization and maximum security.  True innovation, by definition, is disruptive. So buckle up.  Wood layers image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TOKEN SALE,Michael J.

According to Korean news agency Yonhap, the move comes after South Korea's Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that cryptocurrencies can be seen as property with value that can be subject to forfeiture in criminal cases.  As of press time, the nearly 200 bitcoins are worth a little over $1.4 million, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  The Supreme Court order backs up a previous ruling from an appeal that overturned a lower court's decision to reject a prosecutor's petition to forfeit the criminal's cryptocurrency assets.  According to Yonhap, the lower court denied the request based on the argument that cryptocurrencies only ""exist electronically and have no physical form."" However, the appeals court later concluded that cryptocurrency can be seen as ""profit earned from trade in goods.""  It remains unclear, however, as to how the South Korea authority would handle the forfeited digital assets. That said, today's decision marks a notable legal reference, since there are ongoing criminal cases in South Korea involving cryptocurrencies.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, prosecutors from the Incheon district filed a suit in December 2017 against a firm called Max Mining and 21 suspects in an alleged $250-million cryptocurrency mining fraud.  Most recently, prosecutors in Seoul have also raided several local cryptocurrency exchanges over suspicions of fraud and embezzlement, reportedly seizing assets for further investigation.

42429144,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLryBh,1527674412,"Bitcoin Fights Back, But Too Early to Call Bull Reversal","Bitcoin's (BTC) bulls have staged a defense after nearly a month of losses, but a short-term bullish trend reversal is not yet confirmed, the technical charts indicate.  As of writing, the cryptocurrency is up 5 percent at $7,487 on Bitfinex, having clocked a four-day high of $7,560 earlier today.  A minor corrective rally had been expected, courtesy of a bullish price-relative strength index divergence in the short duration charts seen over the last two days.  Further, the resulting bullish outside-day candle engulfed the price action seen on Monday and Tuesday, and has neutralized the immediate bearish outlook.  Daily chart  As the name suggests, the bullish outside-day indicates a bearish-to-bullish trend change. However, analysts and traders usually wait for confirmation – positive follow-through before calling a reversal.  So, a short-term bullish trend reversal would be confirmed if bitcoin takes out the descending (bearish) 10-day moving average (MA) hurdle in a convincing manner. Currently, the 10-day MA is located at $7,562 and is capping the upside in prices, as seen in the chart above.  Meanwhile, the 50-candle MA hurdle in the 4-hour chart below is also proving a tough nut to crack.  4-hour chart  A high volume break above the 50-candle MA of $7,520 could see bitcoin attack the descending trendline hurdle, currently located at $7,930.  That said, prices will likely revisit $7,100 if bulls are unable to cross the key moving average hurdle in the next few hours.  The chart also shows the major moving averages (50,100 and 200) are trending south, a lingering bearish setup. So, a convincing break above the 50-candle MA will be easier said than done.  View  The immediate outlook has been neutralized, but only a convincing move above the 10-day MA of $7,562 would add credence to yesterday's bullish outside-day candle and signal a short-term bullish reversal. In such a case, BTC will likely test the descending trendline hurdle, now seen at $7,930.  The overall bias remains bearish as long as the falling trendline hurdle remains intact  Repeated rejection at the 50-candle MA resistance in 4-hour chart could yield a pullback to $7,100–$7,000.  A break below $6,900 would open up downside towards $5,000, while a move above the recent high of $9,990 would revive the long-run bullish outlook.

42429125,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrxlh,1527667204,"EOS Is Coming, If Anyone Can Figure Out How to Vote","After a year-long initial coin offering (ICO), what has perhaps become the most hotly anticipated blockchain is scheduled to launch on June 2.  That blockchain is EOS, which has raised more than $2 billion in its token sale for Block.one, the company that created what's being touted as a dramatically more scalable and user-friendly version of today's blockchains. Those assertions rest on the project's consensus algorithm, delegated proof-of-stake (dPoS), whereby a set number of nodes – in the EOS case, 21 – will be chosen to act as validators (or ""block producers"").  These nodes will take turns verifying blocks at a rapid clip, with each one taking a turn every three seconds or so. The idea is that with only a few validators it becomes easy to process lots of transactions very quickly (although there have been critics of these claims).  Since these validators will have a lot of responsibility, they will, therefore, be rewarded for their work (through the governance process, the EOS community will get to decide on what the rewards should be) with newly-minted EOS tokens, similar to how bitcoin rewards miners.  As such, it not only looks highly desirable financially to be a validator node but will also come with a certain amount of power. And vying for those spots (or backup node spots, which will also receive rewards) are several dozen organizations.  Companies aiming to serve as block producers range from existing crypto-mining operations, exchanges, blockchain consultancies and teams of EOS enthusiasts. Candidates are spread out all over the world, but China shows the most interest, followed by entities in the U.S.  This question of power has been at the center of quite a bit of debate, with skeptics, led by ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, saying that EOS's governance system is easily manipulable. According to Buterin in a post titled ""Plutocracy Is Still Bad,"" it would be easy for cartels to form within such a small system.  Those spots, though, won't be chosen by Block.one; the company merely created the software, but once the mainnet blockchain launches, the choices made over the blockchain will no longer be Block.one's responsibility.  Sure, the company may be investing millions of dollars into the EOS ecosystem, but for now, just days before the launch, it doesn't seem to have invested in educating the community on how they can participate in its governance.  Even Katie Roman, an EOS cheerleader and self-described Dan Larimer (who co-founded Block.one) fangirl, acknowledged the issue stemming from Block.one's hands-off approach after launch.  ""Block.one has said since the beginning of this project that they are not launching the chain, so the details of where and how to vote are not up to them,"" she told CoinDesk, adding:  ""This is the hard part about decentralization and DPOS in general. Anyone can lead an effort, but that also means that there is a chance that no one leads an effort.""  Nathan James, the founder and CEO of Scatter, a Metamask-like application for storing and interacting with EOS, echoed much the same, telling CoinDesk, ""A lot of this launch has fallen to the community.""  Block.one has not replied to multiple requests for comment for this story.  The voting process  Still, there are a few videos and blog posts circulating about how the validator voting process will work.  The protocol uses so-called approval voting to designate validators, whereby each wallet can ""approve"" up to 30 validators and those approvals will determine the 21 ""supernodes."" Voting users don't have to pick all 30, though, but they also can't cast unused approvals to bolster their favorite validator.  Voting happens continuously. There's no election, per se, instead, an election is constantly running. With each new block, validators could potentially get ousted.  And once a token is staked for a vote, that token stays staked for a minimum of three days.  This means there is a cost to voting.  A user that stakes tokens to vote faces the risk that they can't sell those tokens if the price dips or spikes. And no doubt there's a lot of people holding EOS tokens right now hoping for a price spike right after mainnet launch. For instance, a quick scroll through the EOS Telegram channel shows that many users are excited about these potential gains.  ""The whole point of the voting process is to have informed voters who have stake in the system,"" Syed Jafri, founder of EOS Cafe Calgary, a validator candidate, wrote CoinDesk in an email. ""If you have a financial stake in the network and wish to protect it, the best way to decide the future of the system is through participation in the voting processes.""  Yet, that only works if people do care about the future of the system and understand that voting helps ensure it, and aren't just in it for the financial gain.  Another mechanism of the dPoS system is that a wallet's vote is weighted by the number of EOS tokens it has staked on the network, so in this way, people with more tokens can have more of a say.  Block.one's VP of Product, Thomas Cox, wrote about this process in a blog post, acknowledging that the system does give wealthier users more power, but saying that since EOS is all about the property of financial assets, the people with the most assets should have more weight.  Since EOS is more like a glorified bank account and not a nation-state, Cox wrote:  ""Blockchains don't run prisons and they can't prosecute people for violent crimes. The very reasons that make 'one person, one vote' so important in a real-world government, are simply not present in a property based blockchain.""  While this type of system has proven to rub some crypto enthusiasts the wrong way, as they contend no one should have more power than any other person on the network, it is a trade-off for scale which will be now be tested.  In the code  But for many in the community, just how exactly they can participate in the system is unclear. For instance, if a user wants to stake 100 EOS tokens to vote on who he/she believes to be the best validators, how does he/she actually do that?  While there are several posts about the importance of voting and what kinds of issues users will be able to vote on, none tell users exactly how to vote.  There is an answer, though, but it's in the code.  Roman wrote that Block.one is ""enabling command-line voting, but most token holders do not have the technical skills to vote that way (me included).""  And as Roman noted, that's not the easiest place for many in the community to understand. The ones that do understand it are likely those in a position to want to maximize their control over the network: potential validators.  Some community members are trying to get ahead of this problem.  For example, Roman is running a fundraising campaign to pay for the development of a user interface that she hopes it will be ready by the launch. And James has built an interface, but that's only for use on Scatter.  Plus, one of the biggest crypto exchanges, Bitfinex, which holds EOS on behalf of its users, took to Reddit to commit to building a tool that would allow its users to vote with their EOS. But the target date for that tool's release was May 16, and currently, there's been no tool launched or no update issued.  Bitfinex did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Still, even if these tools launch in the few remaining days before the EOS mainnet launch, many users will be unaware they exist. Some even wonder whether the blockchain will be launched after all since without adequate voter participation the blockchain will not go live.  According to James, ""For a chain to become 'launched' 15 percent of the total tokens must be voted.""  He continued, contending user education is greatly needed right now:  ""What we need right now is people to come together and create informational videos, posts and tutorials about the process and the importance of voting.""  And there's not much time left.

He told the audience:  ""Ever since the start of the 21st century, a new generation of industrial revolution is substantially reshaping the global economic structure ... with artificial intelligence, internet of things and blockchain constantly making application breakthroughs.""  Xi further noted that in order to thrive amid global economic competition, China will launch national laboratories with high standards to foster research and development of technology infrastructure.

42380749,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zFKb,1527652835,6 Outrageous Moments In Crypto Twitter Scam History,"Scammers are a nuisance.  Perhaps nowhere else within the cryptocurrency space have scammers become more frustrating than on crypto Twitter. The social media site has been overtaken with accounts impersonating notable figures and businesses promising tens of thousands of bitcoin or ether or XRP, in return for users merely sending a small amount of a cryptocurrency to their accounts in return.  While it might seem intuitive that these giveaways are suspect, the fraudsters are playing to people's FOMO (fear of missing out), but also the language and cultural barriers that exist within the diverse, global community.  Indeed, crypto aficionados of all kinds – not just the most prominent founders, but also low-profile developers and newly announced ICO issuers and nearly everyone in between – wake up every morning, scouring their Twitter accounts and reporting the abuse to the social networking giant.  Yet, it seems there isn't an easy way to stop the shakedowns.  It's led many crypto visionaries to go about getting Twitter's blue check mark, a sign that an account has been verified and is therefore supposedly more legitimate. But even that has proved manipulable.  Airing frustration towards the chaos that crypto Twitter has devolved into, a well-known cryptocurrency advocate known as Thomas 'Mad Bitcoins' Hunt tweeted:  ""Your system is broken. Allowing users to choose the same name and image as other users is a mistake that leads to fraud. Change your system. End this fraud.""  But still the chaos has continued (if not gotten worse), and many crypto enthusiasts are deciding if you can't beat 'em, you might as well laugh at 'em.  As such, they're tweeting out the most egregious interplay between themselves and the scammers, and sometimes one con man to the next.  1. Not giving away ETH, but giving away ETH  The instances of impersonation have gotten so bad, that many crypto visionaries have added language to their profiles stating ""[Not giving away ETH/BTC]"" – as if it was their middle names.  But, although it could seem counterintuitive, as these fraudsters merely copy and paste the name and image onto their scam accounts, that language too has carried over.  Generally, these accounts comment their giveway images under a post from the real person they're trying to impersonate, hoping to prey off users that aren't looking closely at the handles, which at times are only one letter off from the originals.  And as scammers have become more sophisticated, they've taken to blocking the person they're trying to impersonate, so that that person can't see their posts, report it and get shut down by Twitter.  Just like the scammers above try to confuse users by putting their fake posts side-by-side the people they're impersonating, other scammers have jumped on posts where many people are mentioned.  Recently, South African crypto exchange, iceCUBED, tweeted out a list of crypto notables for what has become known as ""Follow Fridays"" – whereby a user tweets out people that their followers should follow.  I was featured alongside folks like monero lead maintainer Riccardo Spagni, Lightning Labs founder Elizabeth Spark and litecoin creator Charlie Lee (I know, I'm not worthy).  Right under that post, though, another user by the same name, but with a different handle, posted about an ETH giveaway.  And in that way, some unsuspecting users could think that not only the exchange but also the people tagged in the post support the promotion.  While journalists might seem strange characters to impersonate (especially since I've written about not being a crypto millionaire), it has become a popular move since they typically have significant followings of users of all skill levels, including newbs to the cryptocurrency scene who might not be well-versed on the state of the industry.  3. Getting personal  Another way scammers (whose accounts generally have only a couple followers and whose only tweets are the ones about the giveaways) are trying to trick users is by creating more personal accounts.  For instance, a Twitter user named Dennis Parker was recently impersonated. The account copied and pasted his name and picture but the bio was very different.  Whereas the real Dennis Parker's bio just says, ""Bitcoin Maximalist,"" the scam account (which was still active at the time of this writing) says, ""Foodie, Editor, Water Protector, Wine Connoisseur, Unwashed Mass. I own 25 hoolahoops.""  As Parker tweeted:  ""My scam accounts are getting personal.""  Not only that, but scammers have also gone to other lengths to try and bilk users out of their crypto. Notable venture capital investor Tim Draper tweeted about one of his impersonators asking his followers for funds in exchange for mining bitcoin for them.  4. Scammers calling out scams  Most people in the crypto scene know Neeraj Agrawal, the communication lead at Washington D.C.-based lobbying group Coin Center and also a meme god on crypto Twitter.  Lesser-known is NeerajKAgrawal7, who recently replied to an offering of ETH with one word – ""scam.""  While that might not seem particularly surprising, what's absurd is that the response came from one of Agrawal's imposters, not Agrawal himself.  As Agrawal tweeted, ""My ether scammer is calling out other ether scammers.""  In a similar instance, an account posing as Bruce Fenton (the thought leader and investor in the cryptocurrency space who founded Satoshi Roundtable) commented with its own crypto giveaway on the giveaway post from a fake Mad Bitcoins.  Speaking to the event, Mad Bitcoins tweeted:  ""It's a beautiful cycle of spam Twitter and you should make it stop!""  5. Tons of Charlie Shrem's  As mentioned above, many of the most acclaimed people in the cryptocurrency space deal with insane amounts of scam accounts.  Case in point, Charlie Shrem, the founder of now-defunct early bitcoin exchange BitInstant and now an adviser for several blockchain projects, tweeted recently about all the scam accounts under his name.  He said:  ""I do give away stuff from time to time, but will never ask you to send me something first.""  The tweet was accompanied by images which display just how rampant the scam accounts have become.  Another crypto character that gets impersonated quite a bit is John McAfee, who became famous after launching the popular anti-virus software and is now promoting ICOs on Twitter for a fee.  Yet, many crypto enthusiasts might not sympathize with McAfee since they see his new ""job"" as dubious.  In fact, McAfee's latest ICO-promoting tweet featured Pink Taxi Coin, a dubious ICO project with a plagiarized white paper and website, among other red flags.  6. ""I've made it""  While these impersonators have become a scourge on crypto Twitter, some have taken to joking about how having a scammer impersonate them is a way to display that they're popular.  A prominent parody account in the space, Swift on Security, said, after a fraudster impersonated the account, ""I've made it. I've finally made it.""  As such, Kevin Pham, who became a staple of crypto Twitter this year, tweeted (after being impersonated):  ""Fuck blue checks. Having a scam account is the free market signalling you're a somebody on Crypto Twitter!""

42380739,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zF81,1527644707,Ethereum Classic Claims Successful Blockchain Fork,"Ethereum classic has removed its so-called ""difficulty bomb.""  Designed to increase the difficulty of mining its blockchain over time, the code was a feature of the original ethereum codebase (which later split into ethereum classic and ethereum) in 2016. The successful network upgrade took place at block 5,900,000, according to available network data and statements from developers involved in the project.  While it is difficult to account for exact percentages in terms of how many nodes updated their software (owing to a lack of available tools), developers involved with the project told CoinDesk that most exchange nodes and mining pools reported updating their software well before the fork.  There was no indication of any ill effects or bugs in the hours immediately after the fork. The upgrade is expected to reduce the amount of time it takes to create a block.  As such, the upgrade puts both technical and ideological distance between the ethereum classic and ethereum blockchains.  While the ethereum community remains committed to transitioning to a proof-of-stake consensus system, the ethereum classic community has elected to continue using proof-of-work, as its members contend that, of the various ways to achieve consensus over block validation, it resists centralization best.  More specifically, advocates argue that proof-of-work systems require their validators (miners) to continuously invest in hardware and therefore in the blockchain.  Deliberation on the fork started as early as 2016, and due to the extensive discussions, the upgrade was not expected to be controversial or complicated.
