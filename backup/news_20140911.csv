42377610,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72R1B,1410473159,Overstock Now Accepts Bitcoin in Over 100 Countries Worldwide,"Overstock officially launched its updated e-commerce checkout system today, a new feature that allows shoppers in 107 new countries to buy products with bitcoin via its international website, O.co.  The announcement marks the first expansion of Overstock's bitcoin payment service beyond the US, bringing the checkout option to major global markets such as Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Israel and Japan. The news comes roughly nine months after Overstock first began accepting bitcoin this January through a partnership with Coinbase.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne framed the expansion as a way for the company to showcase bitcoin's cross-border payments capabilities, while expanding real shopping opportunities to the digital currency's users in new markets. Far from being a value add to the company's new international checkout system, bitcoin will serve a pivotal role in Overstock's larger strategy for O.co.  Byrne told CoinDesk:  ""This is our international marketing strategy. We're hoping that bitcoin enthusiasts around the world start shopping at O.co because they know they can spend bitcoin on more than 1 million products here and have them delivered to the whole globe.""  Byrne further revealed the latest way that Overstock will seek to incentivize shoppers using both its US website and its international platform, saying that 4% of the money consumers spend using bitcoin will be donated to support groups that promote and defend bitcoin adoption.  The Chamber of Digital Commerce will be the first recipient of funds from Overstock, though Byrne could not confirm if the group had yet received any funds.  Supporting bitcoin worldwide  Byrne told CoinDesk that Overstock is already in the process of vetting bitcoin organisations from around the globe. The goal, he said, is to create a list of groups that, like the Chamber of Digital Commerce, will be able to benefit from spending on the e-commerce website.  Rather than establish any formal marketing strategy to promote the launch, Byrne said Overstock will rely on the support of the global community, who with their spending will be able to ensure that non-profit digital currency organisations can continue their work.  Byrne told CoinDesk:  ""If all the bitcoin users around the world did their shopping at O.co in bitcoin, just the 4% of that would provide a tremendous amount of funds to be given back to bitcoin foundations. That's all the money they would need. All the foundations would get fully funded.""  Chamber of Digital Commerce president Perianne Boring told CoinDesk that her organisation was honored at the news, saying:  ""We are gratified that the work of the Chamber is being recognized and we pledge to use these funds to further promote the acceptance and use of digital currencies among government and the larger public.""  Implementation delay  Of course, the formal international bitcoin payments launch came nearly two weeks after its originally scheduled launch on 1st September, a delay that was widely discussed among Reddit users in the bitcoin community.  Addressing this subject, Byrne said the delay was due to the difficulties the company experienced when integrating its new checkout process into its international website. He said that today's launch marks the end of a six-month effort by his team, of which just one month was dedicated to bitcoin development.  Representatives from the company told CoinDesk on 2nd September that the process had been held up by unforeseen development delays, and that it hoped to have the upgraded international website up and running by 4th September.  However, both deadlines passed without any updates until today's news.  International ambitions  Bitcoin could also prove to be a boon for Overstock, which currently sees only about 10% of its traffic from overseas.  By adding bitcoin support, Byrne hopes to change this narrative, winning customers who are more likely to use bitcoin as their primary online spending tool. For example, Byrne told The New York Times in August that he believes adding bitcoin as an international payment option could bring the company as much as $2m in additional revenue this year.  Notably, the move coincides with Coinbase's own international expansion announced yesterday. The California-based bitcoin services provider and payment processor is now available in 13 European countries.

42377594,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72Qkp,1410466808,Dogecoin Community Celebrates as Merge Mining with Litecoin Begins,"Dogecoin has officially switched to auxiliary proof-of-work (AuxPoW) mining.  The update now enables litecoin miners to process transactions, while providing an additional layer of security to the decentralized network.  The altcoin’s switch to auxiliary proof-of-work, also known as merge mining, has been in the works for some time. The move was announced this August after months of serious and, at times, passionate debate within the dogecoin community. The merge mining concept was suggested in April by litecoin creator Charlie Lee.  Dogecoin creator Jackson Palmer told CoinDesk that AuxPoW was necessary as the gradual decline in price had removed some of the incentive for miners to mine dogecoin. Further, any resulting network hashrate drop could have created the conditions for potentially malicious transactions to be fraudulently committed and confirmed.  Palmer said:  “One of the harsh realities of proof-of-work based cryptocurrencies is that their security is reliant on mining being profitable for those dedicating their hashing power to the network. By enabling AuxPoW, we're no longer competing for people's hashrates with other scrypt-based coins.”  The hard fork that enables AuxPoW kicked in at block 371337.  Community celebrates fork  While some during the merge mining debate felt that other options were more viable, the community itself has largely come together in support of the AuxPoW initiative. For example, many in the dogecoin community turned the day leading up to the AuxPoW launch into a kind of celebration, hosting giveaways on both the altcoin’s subreddit as well as its official IRC chatroom.  Reddit user GoodShibe, who writes a daily column entitled “Of Wolves and Weasels” on the dogecoin subreddit, said that the fork represents the work of many individuals, both inside and outside of the DOGE community.  GoodShibe told CoinDesk:  “This, of course, is all thanks to our incredible, hard-working dogecoin dev team and the gentle, and sometimes not-so-gentle, prodding of our litecoin friends – including litecoin creator Charlie Lee – who continued to try and win us over despite our Shibe pride (my own included).”  Subreddit moderator TheLobstrosity echoed what many others remarked upon, in that by solving the security question for the time being, dogecoin has more room to grow. The mod noted that it was broad support for the fork’s purpose that made the changeover that much easier, adding that “shibes have embraced the change and optimistically await the results.”  Peoplma  , another subreddit moderator, told CoinDesk that the event is a great example of how communities can come together on certain issues despite the belief that coins are in open competition with one another, saying:  “I think this will be good for both the [dogecoin] and [litecoin] communities, and hopefully will foster some goodwill. Despite occasional inter-coin drama, hopefully we realize we are all part of the same larger crypto community.”  Open road ahead  One question remains – Where does the nine month-old altcoin go from here?  Initiatives utilizing dogecoin continue to grow and develop today. An effort to raise money for flood relief in Kashmir has raised 1.7 million DOGE so far. The funds will be used to provide fresh water and medicine to affected areas. Grassroots donation drives like this are proof that dogecoin, despite its challenges, continues to be a vehicle for good causes.  GoodShibe suggested that, as always, it's up to the community to figure out what dogecoin does with what some have called its second wind. One of the ideal outcomes would be that the added security and merge-mining with litecoin actually encourages more mining and participation from those outside of dogecoin circles.  Adding that “it’s an exciting time to be a shibe”, GoodShibe explained:  “We have access now to a much larger potential pool of hash power to ensure our long-term survival, but we must continue to work on building our DOGEconomy and encouraging the slow, steady, stable growth of our coin in order win it. In short, the more our coin is worth, the more people who will be inspired to mine it.”  Palmer suggested that some litecoin miners might find themselves becoming fans of the meme-themed cryptocurrency, joking: “I think we all know that litecoiners are going to convert to shibes pretty quickly.”  Image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,DOGE,ALTCOIN | DOGE | LTC | MINING | FORKS,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/09/11/dogecoin-community-celebrates-as-merge-mining-with-litecoin-begins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/471a6901d15931a15cb2bdd83b62c39e6df84132-2560x1925.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377611,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72R3h,1410459937,LocalBitcoins Debuts Bitcoin Billing as First Merchant Feature,"LocalBitcoins  has added a new section to its website where users can send and manage invoices, allowing them to receive customer payments in bitcoin.  The offering marks the peer-to-peer platform's first merchant-specific product, and follows a period of heavy demand, according to founder and CEO Jeremias Kangas.  Kangas framed the tool as a basic offering that would nonetheless prove effective at meeting the needs of merchants today before expanding to include additional functionality later.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Many of our users have requested this feature, and it extends quite nicely our existing toolset.""  Kangas indicated that the invoicing tool was originally developed for the company's bitcoin ATM product, but he said the decision was made to extend it to all users. While simple in its current iteration, LocalBitcoins plans to build on this offering, saying:  ""Soon, it will be easy to integrate to websites via our API, basically allowing the same kind of processes BitPay and Coinbase are currently offering.""  The CEO added that such a move could allow LocalBitcoins to take advantage of its global reach and available liquidity in a wide range of local currencies, while integrating novel features that allow merchants to take advantage of its local trader network.  How billing works  Like many of the peer-to-peer platform's offerings, its new merchant tools have a minimalist design that favors ease of use over functionality.  Users can issue invoices in any currency, and the amount included will convert to BTC at the current exchange rate when opened by the recipient.  Payment can be made with any bitcoin wallet, and each invoice uses a unique bitcoin address as a payment reference.  The announcement also demonstrates how LocalBitcoins is seeking to build on its existing services to create a wider network of offerings for both consumers and merchants.  For example, LocalBitcoins announced last week that it had begun taking orders for a bitcoin ATM it first revealed back in February. One unit costs roughly €1,499, plus VAT for individuals in the European Union.  The company sayshttps://localbitcoins.com/atm/order-your-own-bitcoin-atm  that the ATM is unique because it does not require an Internet connection. The ATM issues and receives redeemable codes along with cash, while the actual bitcoin exchange happens on the LocalBitcoins website, making the machine a “cash-box”.  According to the company, the ATM has been able to handle more than 300 BTC in volume with premiums of 5–8%. It is programmed to handle any known currency, although it can only transact using one at a time.  Security concerns  Despite its success in expanding globally, LocalBitcoins has been the subject of a number of security concerns this year, including delayed transactions and wallet issues caused by malware, a security breach targeting the site infrastructure and an outage brought on by server hardware issues.  The company is also at the center of a Florida state criminal case involving a user charged with operating an unauthorized money transmission business.  Based in Finland, LocalBitcoins aims to help facilitate the buying and selling of bitcoin for local currency. Users post their trade on the website or can respond to others’ offers, choosing to pay in cash in person or through online banking.  Additional reporting provided by Pete Rizzo and Dan Palmer.

42377600,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72Qr7,1410456031,Bank of England: Bitcoin Could Disrupt UK Monetary Policy,"The Bank of England's ability to govern monetary forces in the UK economy could be undermined if digital currency is broadly adopted, according to a new BoE report.  The study was the second issuance in a two-part publication on digital currency as part of the bank's most recent Quarterly Bulletin. It follows a previous report in May, in which it called bitcoin a kind of commodity.  While acknowledging the bitcoin protocol as a “genuine technological innovation”, the Bank of England largely dismisses bitcoin’s ability to function on a wider scale, although it does suggest that broader adoption could take place in the future.  The report cites price volatility and the risk of diminishing returns for miners as systemic problems that, in its authors’ views, will keep digital currency from becoming more than an auxiliary payments infrastructure.  However, the report does look at the hypothetical mass adoption of digital currency. In a scenario in which the UK economy becomes, in the Bank of England’s words, “bitcoinized”, the central bank’s chief monetary authorities would become increasingly unable to influence prices and economic activity as a whole.  The report states:  “Since in this extreme scenario all payments would be conducted away from sterling as base money for essentially all of the economy, the Bank’s ability to influence price-setting and real activity would be severely impaired.”  The authors go on to say that “such an outcome is extremely unlikely” owing to the barriers to broader adoption cited in the report. Notably, the report concludes that this reduction in influence is “implausible absent a severe collapse in confidence in the fiat currency”, suggesting that digital currency could fill a monetary vacuum should a national currency experience a significant change in value.  Bitcoin ‘could serve as money’  One of the major questions explored in the Bank of England’s report is whether or not bitcoin is a form of money. The study relies on a common, three-part definition of money that involves three use cases: as a store of value, a medium of exchange and a unit of account.  The Bank of England explains that, under current conditions:  “Digital currencies could serve as money for anybody with an internet-enabled computer or device. At present, however, digital currencies fulfil the roles of money only to some extent and only for a small number of people. They are likely at present to regularly serve all three purposes for perhaps only a few thousand people worldwide, and even then only in parallel with users’ traditional currencies.”  However, this could be subject to change. The report highlights that, long-term, growing confidence in digital currencies could lead to broader use as a store of value and a medium of exchange.  For accounting purposes, the Bank of England acknowledges that few businesses, if any, denominate their records in bitcoin. Should this practice emerge, that element of the definition of money could become more relevant for digital currencies.  A ‘bitcoin economy’ would fail  The report contains a hypothetical scenario in which digital currency served as the basis currency for an economy. Suggesting that price deflation and poor economic performance would arise, the Bank of England concludes that a bitcoin economy would pale in comparison to one backed by a centralized, national currency.  Specifically, an economy based on digital currency would face the risk of “welfare-destroying volatility”. As the bank explains:  “In most existing digital currency schemes, the future path of supply is pre-determined and governed by a protocol that ensures that the eventual total supply will be fixed. This has the effect of removing any discretion from the determination of the money supply.”  The report goes on to say that certain steps could be taken to reduce volatility in an economy that uses digital currency. These includes making the coin supply growth rate more variable, pegging the block reward amount to the number of transactions or level of broad demand for bitcoins.  Too early to tell  According to the Bank of England, bitcoin and digital currencies do not – at present – pose a threat to the broader financial system. Yet it does suggest that, should broader adoption take place, the integration of bitcoin with complex financial instruments and global marketplaces could deepen the impact of any price volatility on the broader economy.  The report notes that there is “little incentive” currently for a major shift from fiat to digital currencies. However, the technology’s use as a form of money – and the broader applications of the decentralized ledger – could expand in the future.  The authors conclude:  “Digital currencies do not, at present, play a substantial role as money in society. But they may have the potential to come to exhibit at least some of the functions of money over time.”  Bank of England image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/09/11/bank-of-england-bitcoin-could-disrupt-uk-monetary-policy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4af0d78d06e62d94f99315beef3b78c5a4bc9b10-1500x750.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377609,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72R2R,1410452442,Spain Cracks Down on Bitcoin Gambling Loopholes,"The Spanish government agency that oversees matters of finance and taxation has issued a new ruling stating that bitcoin should be treated as an electronic payment system, a decision that could have a far-ranging impact on Spain's bitcoin economy.  El Ministerio de Hacienda y Administraciones Públicas  issued the ruling in response to questions from Coinffeine, a Spain-based, open-source bitcoin exchange platform. Abanlex, the company's law firm, had previously reached out to both El Ministerio de Hacienda and the country's Congress seeking clarity on two issues in April.  With its response, El Ministerio de Hacienda found that bitcoin-based online gambling companies in Spain must now apply for licenses. Further, the ruling, coupled with new statements from Congress, suggests that bitcoin transactions involving a business may be subject to existing laws that impose a cap on cash transactions of €2,500 or more.  Coinffeine sought clarity from el Ministerio de Hacienda on whether online bets conducted with bitcoin should be considered binding from a legal standpoint. Further, it aimed to solicit a response from Congress as to whether certain financial laws applied to bitcoin.  Coinffeine CTO and co-founder Ximo Guanter told CoinDesk that the rulings represent a significant development in terms of how bitcoin is being regulated globally.  He told CoinDesk:  ""The 'big-theme' news here is that Spain is starting to treat bitcoin more like a currency than as an asset, which is the inverse of what the US has done.""  The regulatory update marks the first update from Spain's government on bitcoin since May, when its tax authority, the Agencia Estatal de Administración Tributaria (AEAT) indicated it was monitoring digital currencies for illicit activity.  Possible transaction cap  Although el Ministerio de Hacienda said it will treat bitcoin as an electronic payment system for the purpose of gambling law, it is not yet clear if this interpretation is more broadly applicable.  Congress said in its statements to Abanlex that, should bitcoin be considered an electronic payment system, then additional laws would apply to bitcoin businesses, leading Abanlex to interpret that a current law prohibiting cash payments to businesses of more than €2,500 and existing anti-money laundering (AML) laws apply to bitcoin.  Introduced in 2012, the cash transaction cap prohibits Spain's consumers from paying cash to settle bills of more than €2,500. The law was part of a broader effort to curb tax evasion in the wake of the country's larger economic issues.  Notably, the law only applies to transactions in which at least one entity is a business, meaning peer-to-peer bitcoin transactions are not affected.  Guanter told CoinDesk:  ""The interpretation of our lawyer was: if the Ministerio de Hacienda considers bitcoin an electronic payment system for the purpose of gambling law, then that same definition applies for other laws, and therefore the €2,500 law and the AML laws apply.""  However, for now, he cautioned, this remained an interpretation.  Bitcoin's legal definition evolves  The ruling also built on previous statements issued by international legal bodies, addressing the subject of whether bitcoin is money under Spain’s laws.  El Ministerio de Hacienda shed light on this issue, asserting that bitcoin cannot be considered legal tender or electronic money.  The agency further stated that bitcoin can't be considered an ""economically accessible object"" as it functions as a medium of exchange.  Its statement reads:  “Ultimately, bitcoin is a convertible virtual currency that can be exchanged between users and converted into dollars, euros or other currency of real or virtual legal tender.”  Clarity for gambling sites  The impact on Spain's bitcoin gambling industry is far more certain, and adds to the growing regional differences globally on the issue. For example, the US government's crackdown on online gambling has lead many gambling platforms to embrace bitcoin. Still others have avoided the market due to uncertainty.  All Spain-based gambling sites, even those that operate only in bitcoin, will be subject to the ruling. El Ministerio de Hacienda stated that it is now mandatory for these businesses to obtain a general betting license as well as the corresponding individual license.  El Confidencial  stated in its report that online gambling with bitcoin is becoming increasingly popular in Spain as the sector had previously been able to use bitcoin to avoid the country's Gambling Act.  However, el Ministerio de Hacienda indicated that all game activities are governed that involve ""amounts of money or economically valuable objects in any form"", a definition it said includes bitcoin.  The agency's formal response states (via an informal translation):  ""In consideration of the foregoing, betting activity with bitcoins is included within the definition of gambling.""

42377607,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72Qzv,1410442509,Japanese Bitcoin Growth Continues with New E-Commerce Platform,"The number of locally developed, professional bitcoin services launching in Japan recently is a sign of growing acceptance in the country.  The latest is a multi-service bitcoin platform called Coincheck, which offers a wallet, exchange and merchant payment system. A new feature aimed directly at the e-commerce industry, called 'Coincheck for EC’ will launch on 14th September.  Takuro Mizobe, one of Coincheck's lead engineers, told CoinDesk the company was in negotiations with several online merchants who had contacted the company, looking for the marketing edge they would potentially gain by accepting bitcoin.  He said:  ""As you might know, the number of people who have bitcoin hasn't been scaled in Japan, and they are lacking knowledge of cryptocurrencies. For this reason, [Coincheck's] all-in-one service and brands are user-friendly and accessible [...] Having all of bitcoin ecosystem services in house [is] quite advantageous against competition.""  Mizobe said Japan's massive content industry, that includes manga, anime and games, offered enormous opportunities for bitcoin – especially in terms of micropayments. According to a report by Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), that industry was worth a whopping ¥12 trillion ($111.3bn) in 2012.  Coincheck's e-commerce platform has a simple and easy-to-navigate design, and merchants will be able to integrate it directly into their site. Like similar merchant services, it will instantly convert bitcoin to Japanese yen to assuage concerns about volatility.  As an introductory offer, Coincheck is waiving some of its usage fees.  Positive reactions  Coincheck, which has a staff of five and opened its doors about a month ago, has already received coverage in the local technology media. It has also received funding from Japan's largest social gaming company DeNA through its Incubate Fund, which launched in 2010 and is reported to have invested in other bitcoin companies.  Mizobe sees support from companies like DeNA as a positive sign for the cryptocurrency industry in Japan.  Obtaining banking services, he added, had not been an obstacle, as positive statements on digital currency from members of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party have made the process of setting up smoother than in some other jurisdictions.  Bitcoin in Japan  Japan has for over a decade used sophisticated NFC-based e-cash networks like Suica, Pasmo and Edy (now managed by e-commerce giant Rakuten). This is a double-edged sword for bitcoin – on the one hand, the public is accustomed to using instant electronic payments. On the other, they may see no need for a new and perceivably more edgy one like bitcoin.  Japanese people's willingness to try out new technology is also legendary, which means many may experiment with bitcoin out of sheer curiosity.  Mizobe acknowledged there was suspicion about cryptocurrency thanks to Mt Gox being headquartered in Tokyo, and another little-known (outside Japan) scandal in 2009 surrounding an attempt to create an e-currency called 'Enten'.  ""But fortunately, regulation risk has been low compared to NYC,"" he said.  Bitcoin, he said, was still the biggest paradigm shift in the modern financial industry for the past 100 years, adding:  ""Even in Japan, some evangelists – including the guys who are working at big enterprise – are trying to appeal to others to accept bitcoin, and they have contacted us.""

The bitcoin teller machine has been installed in a restaurant called Superfoods since June.  Satoshipoint co-founder Hassan Khoshtaghaza told the Bristol Post that 250 transactions were completed in August, making up the £38,000 in value. Jonathan Harrison, Khoshtaghaza's partner in the business, said most of the transactions were to purchase bitcoin:  ""It's mostly been buy transactions there. The Bristol location is doing well for us.""  According to Superfoods founder Charlie Furnivall, the machine has been good for business. He reported an uptick in foot traffic to his restaurant, which he describes as a ""fast-food restaurant with healthy food"". On its menu are wheatgrass shots, protein pancakes and salads. The restaurant also accepts bitcoin.  ""We've got customers coming in and using the machine. We've got people using it most days. It's definitely been good for business for us,"" he said.  Regulars loading up on bitcoin  The Bristol machine has even attracted users from neighbouring countries like Wales, as well as local regulars who are loading up on bitcoin, according to Furnivall.  ""We've got a range of people coming in,"" he said. ""There's one guy who comes in every week on a Friday in a scaffolding van, and he feeds the machine a whole load of cash.""  Satoshipoint  operates four bitcoin ATMs in the United Kingdom: two in London, one in Brighton, and the Bristol machine. Three of the ATMs are Robocoin units, which offer two-way transactions between bitcoin and fiat currency, and one is a one-way Lamassu version that only allows customers to buy bitcoin.  Its London ATM will be featured on a Channel 4 News programme on bitcoin that will air tonight in the UK.  That machine is located in a restaurant called Nincomsoup in the Old Street Tube station, which serves the city's technology startup quarter, the so-called 'Silicon Roundabout, which is home to firms like Airbnb, Last.FM and the bitcoin-focused co-working space T15B.  Expansion plans  Harrison said his firm already has an additional ATM that it is seeking to deploy. He is currently scouting potential locations for it, most likely outside London, as well as evaluating new machines on the market as his company seeks to further expand.  Notable new entrants in the bitcoin ATM manufacturing space include CoinOutlet, which launched its two-way machines this month, priced at a relatively low $8,000 each, undercutting Robocoin's units by nearly 50%.  The traditional ATM sector has also taken notice of the growing business for cryptocurrency ATMs, with the ATM Industry Association issuing an official position paper on 4th September calling for greater oversight and regulation of bitcoin ATMs and their operators.  Last November, the first bitcoin ATM, a machine in Vancouver, made headlines when its operator Bitcoiniacs reported that it had completed more than C$1m (US$910,000) in transactions within a month of its launch. Since then, the bitcoin ATM space has grown significantly, as both manufacturers and operators continue to emerge.

42377592,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72QjZ,1410433710,Sir Richard Branson: Bitcoin is Working,"Sir Richard Branson has revealed further support for bitcoin as a functional, albeit volatile, currency.  Asked in an interview with Bloomberg News whether the cryptocurrency will eventually work, the Virgin Group billionaire said that bitcoin is already working:  “I think it is working. There will be other currencies like it that may be even better, but in the meantime there's a big industry around bitcoin. You know, people have made fortunes out of bitcoin, some people have lost money out of bitcoin.”  Making money on volatility  While Branson admitted that bitcoin remains volatile, he added that this is not necessarily a bad thing. “It is quite volatile, but in volatility people can make money,” he said.  The entrepreneur also reflected on Virgin Galactic’s decision to start accepting bitcoin payments last November:  “I am not foolish, if people have got lots of bitcoins and they want to go to space, I would much rather they spend that money on our spaceship [...] a Virgin Galactic spaceship than on, you know [...] Elon [Musk] will be sending people to space one day on Elon’s spaceships, so we’ll grab the money while it’s there.”  Earlier this year Branson said that Virgin Galactic had already received payment in bitcoin from six different customers.  SpaceShipTwo ready in early 2015  Virgin Galactic has been testing much of its hardware in recent months, but Branson admits building the infrastructure for commercial spaceflights has been hard. He told Bloomberg that Virgin’s rockets are still undergoing flight tests, but the rest of the infrastructure is already ready.  “Early next year we will finally be up and away,” said Branson.  Virgin’s goal is to fly tourists to space in suborbital flights, using its SpaceShipTwo craft.  In addition to Virgin Galactic’s decision to accept bitcoin payments, Branson has also made his mark in the wider bitcoin industry by investing in BitPay.  Branson took part in a $30m Series A funding round for the payment processor, along with Index Ventures, AME Cloud Ventures, Founders Fund, RRE Ventures and others. At the time it was the largest-ever funding round for a bitcoin company.

42377613,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72R6D,1410430335,How Consensus Algorithms Solve Issues with Bitcoin's Proof of Work,"It used to be that bitcoin mining was a community affair, but the process of confirming bitcoin transactions now requires an immense amount of hashing power specific to the SHA-256 mining algorithm.  As a result, the amount of electricity required to process and verify transactions has reached an immense scale.  In the early days, when the first users like the late Hal Finney began experimenting with bitcoin, users could just open the early bitcoin client and let their CPU whir away, creating bitcoins for fractions of a penny. By contrast, mining now requires tens of thousands of dollars in equipment, electricity and optional hosting expenses.  As a result, those who have significant financial resources have come to dominate the bitcoin mining space. Mining today is embodied by the emergence of enterprise-style, datacenter-hosted mining operations.  Jackson Palmer, who created the scrypt algorithm-based, proof-of-work altcoin dogecoin, is not overly positive on the prospect of mining overall, particularly in regards to the energy consumption.  He told CoinDesk:  “I'm quite openly against [proof of work] mining as the future of digital currencies based on the amount of energy it wastes, and damage it does to the environment – without giving anything back apart from making the fiat rich richer.”  One possible solution that has already been deployed in the digital currency ecosystem shifts away from proof of work, but still embodies the principles of a non-centralized systems.  The big technology race  A major issue that plagues mining today – but may not receive much attention – is that the application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for SHA-256 or scrypt mining are only capable of one process.  ASICs can mine digital currency and confirm transactions, but once they are rendered obsolete by next-generation mining gear, the equipment quickly loses its value.  While most components in mining gear are recyclable, the turnaround from product creation to product demise in this industry is a short.  In order to mine competitively, there is a constant race to build and obtain more powerful equipment.  There’s nothing wrong with a little competition, but the race to build better miners has seen the rise of enormous operational costs. As a result, many miners are locked into long-term return-on-investment (ROI) schemes that are susceptible to any significant changes to bitcoin's exchange value.  A decline in the price of bitcoin could diminish the incentive for many miners to participate. While this wouldn't lead to any immediate disruptions, the long-term health of the decentralized network could be put at risk as only the well-financed mining outfits could continue working.  Given these threats, is there an alternative to proof-of-work systems that hash out cryptographic problems and, all the while, use up excessive amounts of money and natural resources?  While there have been a number of proposals to use proof of work for good use, such as for solving prime numbers or promoting personal health, these may not be the ideal solution either.  Solution in the pipeline?  A possible solution to issues related to proof of work may come from an academic paper published by Miguel Castro and Barbara Liskov from MIT in 1999 presenting the concept of Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT).  PBFT is a system initially devised for low-latency storage systems – something that could be applicable in digital asset-based platforms that don't require a large amount of throughput, but do demand many transactions.  Daniel Feichtinger, co-founder of a startup called Hyperledger that utilizes PBFT, explains how its distributed system works:  “Each node publishes a public key. Any message coming through the node is signed by the node to verify its format. Once enough responses that are identical are reached, then you can agree that is a valid transaction.”  That agreement constitutes what is known as 'consensus'. Just as bitcoin uses a decentralized system in order to confirm transactions without the need for a trusted third party, PBFT relies on the sheer number of nodes in order to confirm trust. As a result, hashing power is not required in this process.  “When you interact with multiple parties, you need some sort of consensus mechanism to ensure everyone has got the right records,” said Dan O’Prey, the second co-founder at Hyperledger.  Consensus already at work  Consensus-based transaction mechanisms have been on the market for some time. Ripple Labs utilizes this approach as part of its underlying protocol, based on the concept of PBFT.  Ripple Labs recently released a white paper on its consensus algorithm that points out the Byzantine Generals problem of communicating over an unreliable link, something PBFT is intended to solve.  The white paper states:  “It is provable that no solution to the Byzantine Generals problem (which already assumes synchronicity, and known participants) can tolerate more than (n−1)/3 byzantine faults, or 33% of the network acting maliciously.”  As a fork of Ripple, the Stripe-backed digital currency Stellar, founded by Jed McCaleb, also encompasses these same ideals. The idea, as shown in the graphics above, is that for every node added to a network's Universal Nodes List, the stronger the system becomes.  Yet there is a key weakness to this kind of structure – the source of incentive – and it is a fair question to ask. Unlike mining, what incentive exists for individuals or entities to host nodes?  Both Ripple and Stellar, along with Hyperledger, believe that there will be enough stakeholders to support PBFT-based transaction systems.  Hyperledger's approach  The Hyperledger project allows developers to create their own digital assets with a distributed ledger powered by nodes built on the principle of PBFT.  The system could be used to digitally back a real asset (such as a house), create new coins, or form a fault-tolerant system of consensus. Hyperledger co-founder Feichtinger said, using the latter application, his company's platform could even be used for advanced IT systems.  He explained:  “If you were Amazon running a distributed file system for AWS [Amazon Web Services] in your datacenter, [you] want to ensure an error is not going to corrupt AWS [and] you don’t need incentive. You run the nodes that you want, [using] a consensus system.”  The idea for Hyperledger’s use of PBFT goes beyond asset-based systems. It takes the idea of an algorithm for consensus and uses it to distribute all sorts of technical solutions – not just the low latency, high-speed file storage solution it was originally built to provide.  This might be a good method of testing the power of nodes that do not use incentive to develop their strength. What will happen without such rewards? Systems like Hyperledger aim to find out.  “If you use Byzantine Fault Tolerance, ideally [corruption] problems are contained. The other nodes can realize [a] node is misbehaving, and not respond to its messages,” Feichtinger said.  Consensus as a service  There could be value in providing consensus-as-a-service in the way that cloud providers sell software-as-a-service or infrastructure-as-a-service. In the case of Ripple and Stellar, consensus becomes a medium of value exchange.  Feichtinger explained:  “Much like Google run their own DNS servers – it’s in their interest to have healthy DNS. It means they get to serve up their ads quicker. I think DNS is good example for this low-level protocol. Increasing the health of the system.""  Given the fact that consensus-based transaction systems are still in the experimental phase (much like the whole of digital currency), expect to see additional solutions like these to appear on the market. Whether they prove to be a viable replacement to proof of work systems will come down to one thing: if they are used or not.  Palmer, whose dogecoin creation relies on auxiliary proof of work (or 'merge mining') to secure its network, added there needs to be new and concrete solutions like Hyperledger and Stellar. These, along with Ripple, he believes, can help grow the digital asset ecosystem as a whole.  He concluded:  “Exciting times [are] ahead. It's great to see real innovation in the digital currency space rather than more Kool-Aid drinking.”  Encryption key image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/09/11/how-consensus-algorithms-solve-issues-with-bitcoins-proof-of-work,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bfd7a3e6696df39375368f596acab4d3aee8f591-1069x572.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
