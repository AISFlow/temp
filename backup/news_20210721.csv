Stellar is partnering with private equity firm Advent on the possible deal, according to unnamed sources cited in the article. Stellar and Advent could decide not to push forward with the acquisition.      In May, San Francisco-based Stellar, a non-profit that supports a blockchain-based platform enabling consumers and institutions to move money, made a $15 million investment in AirTM, a digital wallet and peer-to-peer exchange platform based in Mexico.      MoneyGram has drawn interest from a blockchain payment services firm before. In November 2019, Ripple completed the acquisition of a $50 million stake in the firm. A year later, it sold a third of its stake. The firms agreed to wind down a partnership agreement in March this year after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) brought a case against Ripple.      A Stellar takeover of MoneyGram would be a cruel twist of fate for the embattled Ripple given the two crypto projects' historical rivalry. Jed McCaleb, a co-founder of Ripple, left the company in 2013 after a falling-out with the rest of the leadership to start Stellar.

The India-based Ethereum layer 2 company recently said it was leaning more into blockchain-based gaming and NFTs by launching a project called Polygon Studios.      Sandeep Nailwal, also Polygon's chief operations officer, said on CoinDesk TV’s ""First Mover that “very few people understand that even in the U.S., [gaming] is bigger than Hollywood, [the National Basketball Association] and multiple other industries combined. Play-to-own and various other models that are coming in are going to disrupt the business models in the gaming industry.”      He added, “We all believe that NFT is the gateway to bring masses into the blockchain.""      NFTs in gaming is one of the hotter blockchain trends of the summer. In Nailwal’s opinion, the vibrancy around gaming is thanks to play-to-own games such as Axie Infinity.      All this is happening at an interesting time for Polygon, one of the largest crypto projects to come out of India. The government of Pres. Nerendra Modi has made it clear it’s leery of digital assets. However, Nailwal said he has yet to come across a single project that faced government interference in India.      “They only interfere where there is retail buying and selling of crypto,” Nailwal said. Nonetheless, the company has taken steps to “decentralize” where it operates. “No one can predict the future, which is why Polygon has been one of the first projects that decentralized its location.

42387329,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmUGB,1626899454,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Climbs as Elon Musk Tames Shorts,"Cryptocurrencies rebounded on Wednesday as short sellers covered positions ahead of Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s appearance at The B Word Conference. Bitcoin was trading at around $32,000 at press time and is up 8% over the past 24 hours. The sharp price bounce reflects positive sentiment in an attempt to reverse a monthlong downtrend largely driven by regulatory uncertainty.      During The B Word conference on Wednesday, Musk boosted bullish sentiment as he announced that SpaceX, one of the companies he founded, holds bitcoin on its balance sheet. Musk also stated that he personally owns ether. The announcement contributed to the rising prices across cryptocurrencies on Wednesday with ether breaking above $2,000 for the first time since July 14.    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $31684, +6.06%  Ether (ETH) $1942.6, +8.29%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4358.7, +0.82%  Gold: $1804.2, -0.34%  10-year Treasury yield closed 1.293%, compared with 1.214% on Tuesday.    ""We see that volumes of trading have increased at the lower price levels, presumably because people are buying the dip,” Kirill Suslov, CEO of trading app TabTrader, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.      There is also word that environmental concerns are starting to wane as miners adjust operations to reduce their carbon footprint. The result could encourage those larger investors waiting for an appropriate time to allocate money to cryptocurrencies while fulfilling their environmental, social and governance (ESG) mandate.      “China’s mining crackdown has drastically improved bitcoin’s environmental impact as miners have headed to the cheapest sources of energy on the planet, which more often than not are renewable, and a lot of older and more inefficient mining equipment has been taken offline,” Alexandra Clark, a sales trader at GlobalBlock, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.      Not all analysts are convinced that bitcoin will continue higher.      “Bitcoin and the [wider] cryptocurrency basket have completely unwound their overbought conditions and are no longer stretched,” MRB Partners wrote in an email to CoinDesk.      “That said, this does not suggest that another rally looms, it simply implies that cyclically speaking these digital currencies are less overbought with its cyclical trend now facing downward pressure,” MRB wrote.    Bitcoin futures positioning    The number of open positions in bitcoin futures continues to rise, and what appears to be a proliferation of short sellers indicates a dour market mood. That may bring volatility on the higher side, wrote CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole.      Open interest, or the number of futures contracts traded but not squared off with an offsetting position, reached the highest tally since May 18 on Tuesday, according to data from the blockchain analytics firm Glassnode. The dollar value of the number of contracts open remained flat at around $12 billion.      All things considered, the futures market is mainly biased bearish, which leaves the door open for sharp corrective rallies in bitcoin’s price. When leverage is skewed to the bearish side, a move higher often results in forced closure of short positions (exchanges square off shorts). That, in turn, puts upward pressure on the cryptocurrency’s price, leading to exaggerated price moves.    Short capitulation?    Crypto sentiment has reached a new low, according to some “fear/greed” measures. It is likely that extreme fear caused shorts to cover positions as bitcoin dipped to below $30,000 on Tuesday.      “Many indicators are leaning towards a generally fearful environment at the moment,” Arcane Research wrote in a research note on Tuesday.      Arcane cautioned that investors should beware of the timeliness of some fear/greed measures, especially in traditional markets.      “Keep in mind what happened as fear loomed on March 12, 2020, when the CNN Fear & Greed index reached an extreme low of 3,” Arcane wrote. The S&P 500 proceeded to drop nearly 25%.    Retail interest slows    Google searches for bitcoin have declined since March 2020, coinciding with the crypto sell-off. The current level of relative search interest is not yet at the 2017 low, which “might be a sign that many retail investors and the general public were already aware of Bitcoin prior to the recent price movements this year,” Coin Metrics wrote in a Tuesday newsletter.      “Institutional adoption is a big reason for Bitcoin’s recent successes in 2020/2021, which will not be captured easily from Google search interest,” Coin Metrics wrote.      A similar scenario is seen in the interest in Ethereum, which has benefited from the popularity of decentralized finance (DeFi) over the past year.    Bitcoin Miner Resilience    Bitcoin miners are still accumulating the cryptocurrency, even though some miners are migrating to other places after China started cracking down on crypto mining. “It is possible that additional sell-side pressure from offline distressed miners is being more than offset by the extraordinary profitability by remaining operational miners,” Glassnode wrote.    Stablecoins in the spotlight    A day after stablecoin issuer Circle released more data about the assets behind USDC, other issuers are trying to highlight their efforts in transparency.      Tether executives went on CNBC’s online show “Tech Check” to answer questions about USDT. An audit for Tether, issuer of the largest stablecoin, USDT, could be “months away, not years,” Stuart Hoegner, Tether's general counsel, said in the interview on Wednesday.      Meanwhile, Paxos released a breakdown of reserves of its stablecoins, PAX and BUSD, for the first time: Some 96% of the reserves were held in cash and cash equivalents, while 4% were invested in U.S. Treasury bills as of June 30.      The disclosures come during a time when regulators have been paying increasing attention to stablecoins. Speaking to the American Bar Association on Tuesday, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler said the prices of cryptocurrencies might fall under securities laws.    Altcoin roundup  Elon Musk boosts dogecoin price, again: The price of dogecoin jumped roughly 9% to $0.213 after Elon Musk reiterated that he personally holds the cryptocurrency in addition to bitcoin and ether at The B Word, before it falls back to $0.188 as of press time. However, among the 243 digital assets in the S&P Cryptocurrency Broad Digital Market (BDM) Index, dogecoin is not in.  Argentina province to issue own stablecoin: The Argentinian province of Misiones will issue its own native stablecoin.

The project was approved by Misiones’ House of Representatives and is being studied by an interdisciplinary team that includes Adolfo Safrán, the province’s minister of finance.

42387314,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmTw3,1626893100,"The 2021 Crypto Hype Is Down, but Old Traders Are Unfazed, Says EXMO CEO","The stagnation in the crypto market has discouraged newbies, but seasoned traders remain unfazed, the CEO of the EXMO cryptocurrency exchange said.      EXMO, an exchange with about $40 million in daily trading volume according to CoinGecko, has been catering mostly to traders in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan, but has been actively expanding in the U.K recently, said CEO Sergey Zhdanov.      In June, trading activity on both spot and derivative crypto markets contracted more than 40%, a report by CryptoCompare said.      “Retail traders who flocked into crypto in 2021 were set aback by the declining price,” Zhdanov said. “New people come with an assumption that [crypto] will be growing forever, but then it falls.”    The DOGE crowd    Many new traders were drawn by Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s Twitter rants about dogecoin, Zhdanov said. That was especially notable in the U.K., where EXMO has fewer users, and so knowing who the new traders were was more apparent.      “In January and February, when Elon Musk was tweeting [about DOGE], the first surge of interest happened. [British news outlet] Metro.co.uk wrote about it and provided a link to us, and 10,000 of new British users came, all after dogecoin,” Zhdanov said.      For the vast majority of those newbies, the pattern was simple: They bought DOGE high, sold low after the price went down, and then withdrew money and left, Zhdanov said. They did not switch to older cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or ether and instead just capitulated, he said.      Read also: Dogecoin Falls as Musk Underwhelms and Reality Intrudes      Still, 10% of those new users have remained active traders and made up about $1 million of trading volume during the last six months, Zhdanov said. This doesn’t necessarily mean that those traders invested a lot of money in crypto but rather that they made a lot of trades. They might have been using the same deposit amount to buy coins, sell them and then buy again, and so on.      In contrast to the fresh users, more experienced traders who began before this year and had seen previous ups and downs of the market kept trading even in the days of low volatility and depressed prices, Zhdanov said.      “Experienced traders have a longer-term strategy – even when the market is quiet, they keep buying or selling,” he said.      In any case, the first half of 2021 was better for EXMO than all of last year, according to Zhdanov. The exchange now has 1.9 million registrations, and about 100,000 users have $5 or more in their accounts.

One of his privately held ventures, aerospace company SpaceX, holds BTC, Musk said. SpaceX's bitcoin holdings had not been previously disclosed.      The entrepreneur and provocateur said he personally owns bitcoin, ether and, naturally, dogecoin.      Publicly traded automaker Tesla, whose BTC bags were revealed in February, still holds the asset in its treasury, the CEO said.      The bitcoin price jumped Wednesday by the most since mid-June. At one point, the largest cryptocurrency was changing hands around $32,800, up more than 10% over the past 24 hours, but later pared those gains to about 6%.      According to Quantum Economics founder Mati Greenspan, bitcoin’s price rise earlier on Wednesday was partly on anticipation of the event.      “As we await what promises to be the greatest-ever bitcoin livestream, it’s clear that the market is already very excited,” Greenspan wrote in his daily newsletter. At its peak, Dogecoin was up 19% on Wednesday to about 20 cents.      On Tesla accepting bitcoin for car payments again, Musk said the network's energy usage is improving and Tesla is doing some more due diligence on this, but that Tesla would ""most likely"" resume accepting BTC for payments. The price of bitcoin fell sharply after Musk first announced in May that Tesla would no longer accept bitcoin as payment for its products because of concerns over the amount of energy used to mine it.      Musk also asked fellow conference participant Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter and Square, whether he would consider accepting bitcoin as payment from Twitter’s advertisers as a way to support the cryptocurrency.      Dorsey replied that he agreed with the concept but that he was more focused on creating “economic incentives in the network itself without having to rely on advertising.”      When Musk pressed him for an answer of whether he would actually allow advertisers to pay with bitcoin; however, Dorsey laughed and stopped short of committing to do it right away.      And on the subject of his favorite crypto dogecoin, about which he often tweets, Musk said he likes that the DOGE community is very irreverent and “has great memes and loves dogs, and I love dogs and memes.”      “The most ironic and entertaining outcome would be the the cryptocurrency that was started as a joke to make fun of cryptocurrencies ends up being the leading cryptocurrency,” Musk said, chuckling.      Dogecoin pared its gains later in the day and was up approximately 10% to just under 19 cents over the last 24 hours.      UPDATE (July 21, 20:04 UTC): This story was updated to reflect additional comments from Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey, as well as comments from Musk about dogecoin.",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,"Nelson Wang, Marc Hochstein",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/21/elon-musk-says-spacex-holds-bitcoin-at-b-word-conference,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/82a2cd520f0433fc9cd38a23fcff8fc000abe251-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Why BTC Could See Green Days,"Bitcoin has seen some gains in the past 24 hours as bulls seem to be making a stronger push.

QCP Capital has recorded a &apos;roller-coaster&apos; like price action as Bitcoin dropped from its current levels below $30,000 on the weekend only to return to its past weekly open. This period saw a rise in Bitcoin inflows to exchange platforms. Contrary to popular belief, Senior Commodity Strategist for Bloomberg Intelligence, Mike McGlone, believes that the $30,000 support zone exhibits maturation. As such, he clarified that Bitcoin continues to be in an uptrend supported by bullish signals. In the short term, the China crackdown on the crypto industry has affecting BTC and could be the main source of selling pressure, but in the long-term McGlone believes that this &apos;confirms Bitcoin&apos;s revolutionary value&apos;.

Joseph O’Conner, also known by his online handle PlugWalkJoe, was arrested Wednesday by the Spanish National Police in Estepona, Spain, at the request of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). He was charged with multiple counts of conspiracy and intentionally accessing a computer without authorization.      The Twitter hack compromised the accounts of top cryptocurrency exchanges, and prominent crypto Twitter accounts (including CoinDesk), before moving on to mainstream accounts including those of Elon Musk, Warren Buffett, Kanye West, Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama.

42387315,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmTyZ,1626888850,Tether General Counsel Tells CNBC Audit Is 'Months' Away,"An audit for Tether, issuer of the largest stablecoin USDT, could be “months away, not years,” the company’s Stuart Hoegner said in an CNBC interview on Wednesday.      A day after rival stablecoin issuer Circle released more data about the assets behind USDC, Tether executives went on CNBC’s online show ""Tech Check"" to answer questions about USDT.      CTO Paolo Ardoino and General Counsel Hoegner were interviewed on one of the financial news network’s online shows to take tough questions from Deirdre Bosa. The host pelted them repeatedly with questions about the origin of Tether’s commercial paper and its stalled token issuances even as other stablecoins continue to grow. [A small amount – a little more than $100,000 worth – was issued hours before the interview.]      When asked about audits, Hoegner responded that one could be forthcoming in months, rather than years.    Bosa: ""Quick question just to follow up on the audit. To go back a tiny little bit, I know that you said you would be thrilled to be the first crypto company and stablecoin to go through an audit. Do you have a date in mind?""Hoegner: ""We don't at this time, no, but we are reaching back a couple of years for the financial audit and that is in process.""Bosa: ""Okay, do you think that's years away?""Hoegner: ""Months, not years.""Bosa: ""Only months away?""Hoegner: ""Yep""    Tether promised audits as far back as 2017, but has yet to produce one. The company even hired New York-based accountants Friedman LLP that year to produce reports, but the relationship was dissolved in early 2018. No audit has ever been issued, though Tether published an attested report in March, 2021. An audit is generally considered to be a far more intensive accounting procedure than an attestation.      Despite amounting inquiries demanding more transparency from Tether, Hoegner said in the CNBC interview that “We're happy now with our relationship with Moore Cayman, by extension more global, and we are getting the attests and the market is getting the information and the transparency that it needs to make good, efficient decisions about what to hold.”      While CNBC often has CEOs and CFOs on to discuss their companies, Tether’s top brass are notoriously camera shy. A Financial Times story a week ago about Tether/Bitfinex CEO Giancarlo Devasini is one of the few from a major publication to even mention his name. Ardoino and Hoegner, however, are regular commenters on Twitter, frequently defending the stablecoin, particularly against criticism about the quality of the assets they say back the token with $64 billion in market cap and often the most traded cryptocurrency on any given day.      It’s particularly notable that Ardoino and Hoegner appeared on CNBC. Jim Cramer, host of the network’s popular show, ""Mad Money,"" has repeatedly criticized Tether for its relative opaqueness when it comes to disclosing its assets. For instance, a week ago, he called USDT crypto’s “Achilles Heel” and continued to rip into the stablecoin as recently as Tuesday.      It should also be noted that the interview was online, with fewer than 1,000 people watching rather than on the cable network’s regular TV programming, which often gets multiples of that viewership. Nonetheless, the interview lasted about a half an hour.      Highlights of Ardoino and Hoegner’s appearance include:    Commercial Paper  The Tether executives didn’t answer Bosa’s question of whether Tether holds any Chinese commercial paper, but Hoegner said that the portfolio contains “international commercial paper.” The commercial paper is “overwhelmingly rated A2 or better,” he said, reiterating a previous statement.  When asked who rated the commercial paper, Hoegner said, “That's S&P, Fitch. That's across multiple … we rated that across multiple rating agencies.”  The executives refused to disclose more details about the commercial paper Tether holds, saying that the company doesn’t identify its “commercial partners” and wanted to respect “the privacy of its banking partners.”  Financial Times earlier reported that the largest players in the U.S. commercial paper market were not aware of Tether’s participation. In response to that, Hoegner explained Tether’s operation, saying, “We maintain accounts and a number of banks, financial institutions, they request quotes for commercial paper offerings from their banks, who in turn request those brokers and other counterparties, both direct from issuers and on secondary markets.”  Circle’s Disclosure  When asked their thoughts on Circle’s disclosure on Tuesday, Hoegner said, “We're happy to see them follow in our footsteps and try to approach our level of transparency and disclosure that we've been putting out there in the marketplace.” Tether, once the most opaque stablecoin issuer, issued its first attestation report in March this year, while most other stablecoins issuers started such efforts in 2018 and 2019. Tether revealed the breakdown of its reserves as part of its settlement with the New York Attorney General’s office.  Bosa asked if Tether is worried that Circle’s higher percentage of cash and cash equivalents would draw investors away from Tether. Hoegner said, “Not at all. That has been public for some time. We maintain cash, for example, that has many multiples above our single biggest redemption thus far, as well as above our biggest 24 hour period of redemptions. So we're quite comfortable with our portfolio as a whole.”  “We have never refused a redemption to a customer,” according to Ardoino.",NEUTRAL,USDT | USDC,BUSINESS | MARKET | USDT | USDC,Frances Yue,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/21/tether-general-counsel-tells-cnbc-audit-is-months-away,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a78600cc40a12bd6891b44785a3412bb4217f028-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This resulted in Monero, Zcash, Dash, and others being de-listed from these platforms. Regulators from around the world exerted pressure on these entities to &apos;reduce the risk&apos; and &apos;protect&apos; consumers from the alleged dangers of these cryptocurrencies. This is the usual argument wield by institutions and government agencies, protection, order, crime-fighting. Users&apos; access to tools that protect their identity and financial information has been limited. Regulators purposely omit that privacy is a fundamental human right. Despite their protecting measures, governments and private companies use their citizens&apos; and consumers&apos; data for their interest, surveillance, or profit and rarely give them a choice. People are aware of this issue. Thus, the demand for privacy has led to the rise of encrypted messaging apps such as Signals and privacy coins continue to thrive. The BlackHat Coin (BLKC) Project, launched in April 2021 by a community-driven and self-funded initiative, is one of the solutions created to meet users&apos; demand for privacy. This project seeks to return control and power to the users with a privacy coin running on a stable, decentralized, and resilient node infrastructure.

42411646,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glQ6Na,1626887872,"No, the European Union Is Not 'Banning Anonymous Crypto Wallets'","In a series of shocking statements early yesterday, European Commission regulators declared that they were “banning anonymous cryptocurrency wallets” as part of a money laundering crackdown. This understandably sent crypto markets tumbling – but they quickly recovered, apparently as it became clear the E.U. had woefully misrepresented the substance of the proposed regulation.  The crypto provisions (PDF) were part of a package of four proposals intended to fight money laundering. In a tweet thread summarizing the proposed rules, Mairead McGuinness, the E.U. Commissioner for Financial Services, wrote that the measure “will ban anonymous crypto wallets and make sure that crypto-asset transfers are traceable.”  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here. David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist.  If that sets your hair on fire, take a deep breath. I try not to use the F word, this being a family publication, but this is one of the rare appropriate instances: The statement from McGuinness is straight-up FUD. Rather than a ban on crypto wallets, the E.U. rules would impose tighter but defensible rules on money service providers, such as exchanges or custody services. Either McGuinness and her communications team misspoke out of genuine ignorance when describing the new rules to the public, or they knowingly obfuscated as a way to misdirect public perception.  As Tim Copeland at The Block pointed out, the new rules would be very similar to the “travel rule” guidelines from the multinational Financial Action Task Force. The rules prohibit providing anonymous services, such as crypto custody or exchange accounts provided by a third party, not the provision of software for self-custody.  In short, the ban would impact the crypto equivalent of Swiss bank accounts, not the use of crypto as cash. So if you’re willing and able to self-custody (which you should really be doing anyway), you can still hold and spend crypto anonymously (unless you do commit a crime, then that anonymity probably won’t last long).  “Banning anonymous wallets” would be a truly terrifying goal, because nearly every cryptocurrency wallet is anonymous by default, in the same sense that every web browser is anonymous by default. Wallets like MyCrypto, Exodus and Electrum are software, available for download worldwide. The notion of “banning anonymous crypto wallets,” in other words, implies an utterly draconian crackdown involving raids on server farms hosting wallet code, SWAT teams battering down the doors of DeFi degens’ basement apartments, and developers on trial for helping people move data around.  Read more: EU Policymakers Propose Tighter Regulation of Crypto Transfers  Unsurprisingly, many news outlets reported McGuinness’s statements without examining them. Some even further distorted the essence of the new rules, such as the Irish Times’ laughable declaration that the E.U. would “ban cryptocurrency anonymity,” full stop.  In the face of such credulous headlines, crypto prices briefly swooned, with Bitcoin dropping below $30k. But the ship righted itself quickly and BTC surged back above $31.5k by this morning. That could have been for any number of reasons, but it’s reasonable to guess the resurgence came as traders figured out that the EU was not, in fact, “banning anonymous crypto wallets.”  It’s a mixup that drives home the point that cryptocurrency regulation is too often being created by people who know next to nothing about the technology. (McGuinness also justified the new regulations by leaning hard on the idea that cryptocurrency is a huge new money laundering threat, which simply isn’t true.)  At the same time, it does seem improbable that a high-ranking EU Commissioner, with a staff (mostly) of adult professionals, could get something so basic wrong. So here’s the alternative explanation for the realpolitik crowd: The E.U. knows it can’t “ban anonymous crypto wallets.” But by obfuscating the difference between custodial wallets and self-custody software, they may hope they can mislead some portion of the public into thinking that custodial accounts are the only kind that exist.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,David Z.

Known as Greenlight, the service allows users to maintain complete control over their funds while setting up a Lightning node using the company’s cloud infrastructure, Blockstream said. The private keys for both on-chain and off-chain transactions never leave the custody of the user; rather, users interact with their nodes via a simple user interface managed by Blockstream.      The Lightning Network has seen torrid growth over the past couple of months and has become easier to use as well with the introduction of apps like Jack Mallers’ Strike. Greenlight’s simple interface promises to attract more users.    Read more: Nodes on Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Double in 3 Months    Referred to as a “second layer” system, Lightning is designed to enable microtransactions that may be too costly and slow to execute on the Bitcoin blockchain during periods of high network traffic. If widely adopted, it could make BTC more practical for everyday payments (think cups of coffee).      But the Lightning software can be bewildering for neophytes. Many non-technical enthusiasts often find themselves trusting a third-party service operator with their private keys in return for a simpler setup, undermining one of the chief selling points of Bitcoin: control over one’s money.      “Getting started with Lightning can be a challenge for some, especially the more technical aspects like operating channels or creating backups and watchtowers,” said Christian Decker, core tech engineer at Blockstream. With Greenlight, the company aims to give users the best of both worlds.      Greenlight is built on top of c-lightning, an implementation of the Lightning Network protocol optimized for performance and extendibility. Blockstream has been very public about its support for c-lightning in the past.      The company said it believes c-lightning’s can keep transaction fees low; however, Greenlight also allows users to “share” a node, hence sharing fee costs.      Greenlight is intended to be user-friendly and educational for potential Lightning users or even just hobbyists. Some developers are hamstrung by the fact that they are unable to run their own nodes, Blockstream said. Greenlight is intended to break that barrier and allow for more development.      The service is available on the Sphinx and Lastbit Lightning payment apps and will be released to the public over time. During this rollout period, Greenlight will be free to use.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Myles Sherman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/07/21/blockstream-rolls-out-a-bitcoin-lightning-node-for-n00bs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6b7991fbb06300e0e7a7cd64ffe6842512596820-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company's disclosure came a day after Circle, issuer of the second largest stablecoin USDC, revealed its assets backing the token. Tether, issuer of the largest stablecoin USDT, disclosed a breakdown of the reserves in May.

Speaking to the American Bar Association on Tuesday, Gensler said some platforms are offering crypto tokens “that are priced off” securities and resemble derivatives products. In his view, any security-based products will have to comply with trade reporting rules and other laws, he said.      “Make no mistake: It doesn’t matter whether it’s a stock token, a stable value token backed by securities, or any other virtual product that provides synthetic exposure to underlying securities,” he said. “These platforms – whether in the decentralized or centralized finance space – are implicated by the securities laws and must work within our securities regime.”      Gensler warned that his agency may bring future enforcement actions as well, noting that “we’ve brought some cases involving retail offering of securities-based swaps,” seemingly referring to a case the SEC brought against financial app Abra, which paid $300,000 in penalties on charges of selling security-based swaps to retail investors last year.      Crypto exchange Binance also recently announced it was closing its stock token business, though technically U.S. customers should not have been able to access this service.      Gensler didn’t specify any tokens in his speech, but his remarks come amid increased regulatory scrutiny around digital assets, with stablecoins in particular popping up more and more in congressional hearings.      Yesterday, Circle, the issuer of USDC, published a breakdown of the assets backing the stablecoin. In addition to cash, the token is backed by money market funds, commercial paper, corporate and municipal bonds and certificates of deposits issued by foreign banks.      Some of these reserves, including the money market funds, bonds and commercial paper, are currently treated as securities under U.S. law.

That may bring volatility on the higher side.      Open interest, or the number of futures contracts traded but not squared off with an offsetting position, rose to 397,873.36 BTC on Tuesday, reaching the highest tally since May 18, according to data from the blockchain analytics firm Glassnode. The dollar value of the number of contracts open remained flat at around $12 billion.      When measured in kind, the metric has risen by more than 100,000 BTC since late May. According to experts, the uptick in open interest indicates traders have been opening short or sell positions amid flat-to-negative price action in the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin has mainly traded in the $30,000 to $40,000 range in the past two months, barring a couple of short-lived dips to $29,000.      ""In my opinion, it's mostly short futures, given the persistent negative funding rates in perpetual markets over past few weeks as well as futures markets trading in backwardation,"" Shiliang Tang, chief investment officer of LedgerPrime, a $130 million crypto hedge fund, told CoinDesk.      The perpetual market has consistently seen negative rates since mid-May.      Calculated every eight hours, the funding rate refers to the cost of holding long/short positions in the bitcoin perpetuals (futures with no expiry) market. The metric is used by exchanges offering perpetuals to balance the market and guide perpetual prices toward the spot price.      A positive funding rate means longs are paying shorts to keep the position open, and the market is skewed bullish. Meanwhile, a negative funding rate implies a bearish market positioning.      The three-month basis, or the difference between the price of the three-month futures and the spot price, recently turned negative, flipping into the so-called backwardation, a sign of bearish sentiment among futures traders.      ""Institutional investors seem very cautious at the moment and in general seem to be in the process of de-risking,"" Arcane Research said in a weekly research note published Tuesday. ""The futures premiums on the unregulated offshore derivatives market is also trending towards zero, with FTX still trading at a slight premium.""      One question is whether the uptick in open interest results from direction-agnostic arbitrage strategies, which involve buying bitcoin in the spot market against a sell position in the futures market. The strategy seeks to profit from the futures premium, which evaporates as expiry nears and converges with the spot price on the day of the settlement, making relatively low-risk returns for the carry trader.      However, the regular cash-and-carry strategy has lost its shine with premiums in single-digits or negative (backwardation) compared with the record 40% basis in mid-April.      Some traders anticipating a bullish revival and a rise in the futures premium may have employed a ""reverse cash-and-carry"" strategy by selling bitcoin in the spot market against a long futures position.      ""Increased reverse cash-and-carry positions could have lifted open interest, but I doubt that it's the primary driver,"" Rahul Rai, managing partner at Gamma Point Capital, said. ""So overall, it looks like there's decent short interest at these levels."" Gamma Point Capital runs a market-neutral fund.      LedgerPrime's Tang said reverse cash-and-carry strategies appear quite unattractive with annualized premiums in single digits. Further, Tang pointed to low bitcoin borrowing rates offered by lending-borrowing protocols as evidence of weak demand to borrow bitcoin and short against a long position in the futures market.      All things considered, the futures market is mainly biased bearish, which leaves the door open for sharp corrective rallies in bitcoin's price. When leverage is skewed to the bearish side, a move higher often results in forced closure of short positions (exchanges square off shorts). That, in turn, puts upward pressure on the cryptocurrency's price, leading to exaggerated price moves. ""A rally up could cause them to get liquidated,"" Rai said.      Bitcoin is currently trading at $31,400, representing a 5% gain on the day.

Announced Wednesday, Compass Mining and mining consultancy Navier are rolling out a new tool that lets buyers and sellers verify the advertised hashrate of their specialized bitcoin mining machines.      Like most third-party verifiers, the tool, HashTest, is working to answer a common question for buyers and sellers: How does something actually work versus how it’s advertised?      In the bitcoin mining context, it’s important because there are few ways to verify how a machine is actually performing when plugged in and running at a mining site. That data is usually kept private by mining companies.      “HashTest is a tool we have created for everyone to identify independent and unbiased information regarding an ASIC,” Compass Mining CTO Paul Gosker said in a statement, referring to the application-specific integrated circuit machines that power most bitcoin mining operations. “HashTest will allow sellers to demonstrate the performance of an ASIC to a buyer.”    Read more: Bitcoin Mining Firm Compass Inks Deal With Nuclear Microreactor Company Oklo    Data for retail ASICs is still fairly splintered in terms of transparency. For example, the Compass mining marketplace lets crypto miners big and small purchase and deploy their rigs. A tool like HashTest would allow buyers of mining equipment to get better efficiency data on the machines they’re purchasing. Hashrate is a measure of the computational power working to add new blocks to the Bitcoin blockchain.      “HashTest is the first globally available independent hashrate testing service,” Navier CEO Josh Metnick said in a statement. “We are not a manufacturer, we are not a mine, we are not a pool, and we do not make firmware. Our only goal is to provide the most accurate and unbiased hashrate measurement.

Investment firms 8VC and Digital Currency Group (the parent company of CoinDesk) also participated.      Vincent had previously raised a $2 million in a seed round of funding in December, when the platform emerged from a testing mode.

The crypto search figure for June was down 4% from May, as the category dropped out of the top five segments.      “There has been a small downtick for crypto in June, and I think that’s in parallel with interest rate concerns and inflation concerns, so you’ve seen a little bit of a shift to yield-oriented assets, like real estate and debt in the last two months,” Vincent founder Slava Rubin said in an interview.      Still, startups focused on cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are the leaders under the platform's venture capital search umbrella, ahead of such topics as artificial intelligence and cannabis, Rubin added.      “When we launched in November, crypto wasn’t in the top five of sector searches in startups,” Rubin said. “But now it’s number one month after month.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/07/21/crypto-friendly-investment-search-engine-vincent-raises-6m,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a70f8933d1e63fa20b1647a05bb86404f5637535-1500x1099.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42387303,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmRMH,1626872400,Avalanche to Include Data From Chainlink,"Avalanche, a blockchain-based platform used to launch apps, has incorporated data feeds from Chainlink, an ""oracle"" network, which is a service that brings data from outside sources into a blockchain.      Smart contracts with external data, such as prices, piped in are powering a growing decentralized finance (DeFi) economy of lending apps, decentralized exchanges and price-sensitive derivatives markets. DeFi refers to apps that allow people to conduct financial transactions without a traditional intermediary such as a bank.      Those apps, known as dapps, are being built on the Avalanche platform that went live in September. Avalanche is similar in some ways to other base-layer blockchains like Solana and Binance Smart Chain, but with a novel consensus system and better compatibility with smart contracts that run on the Ethereum platform.      Adding Chainlink data feeds to the mix will kickstart a DeFi ecosystem on Avalanche, said John Wu, president of Ava Labs, the company that runs Avalanche.      “There are over 225 projects building on the Avalanche ecosystem, many of them in integration mode, waiting for some functionality such as oracles from Chainlink,” Wu told CoinDesk in an interview. “Some large stablecoins are also shortly down the pike. So this is why we’re so excited.”      Historically, DeFi and blockchain oracles emerged at about the same time, said Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov.      “That’s not a coincidence,” Nazarov said in an interview. “The dynamic around DeFi is that you really can’t build it without external data. DeFi is what we call ‘a hybrid smart contract,’ in the sense that it combines on-chain code and off-chain systems.”    Read more: Chainlink’s Founder Says DeFi and Oracles Can Help Fight Climate Change    The Chainlink network is a collection of many services that provide data on a wide range of areas from prices to weather to gaming, Nazarov said.      “The industry was about this one smart contract for tokens. Then it moved to tokens plus voting, and then to tokens and voting using external data,” Nazarov said, adding:    “So tokens are like the unencrypted email of our industry; they are the beginning.

42387330,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmRTp,1626867000,Valid Points: Ethereum’s Most Profitable DeFi Applications,"Today, we’re diving into the valuation models and revenue analysis of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols on Ethereum.      For this week’s New Frontiers section, CoinDesk Research's Teddy Oosterbaan presents his findings on the most profitable types of DeFi applications in terms of return for liquidity providers, token holders and protocol treasuries.    This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk's weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum 2.0 and its sweeping impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to Valid Points here.  Pulse check    We’re excited to introduce new and improved graphics for our weekly pulse check on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain and CoinDesk’s Eth 2.0 validator. Two graphics will replace our usual stream-of-consciousness writing in this section to give you a quick overview of activity on Eth 2.0 over the past week.      The first graphic above illustrates the overall health of the Eth 2.0 blockchain through four metrics, including network participation rate, number of validators, total ETH deposited and share of total ETH supply deposited. Generally, the higher these numbers are, the greater the overall security and value of the Eth 2.0 Beacon Chain.    Read more: Ethereum 2.0 Explained in 4 Easy Metrics    The second graphic above illustrates the overall health of the CoinDesk Eth 2.0 validator dubbed “Zelda.”      Zelda has been an active participant of the network since Feb. 17. She has submitted 34,525 attestations, which are votes confirming the validity of data on the blockchain, and she has proposed four blocks. Rewards from attestations make up the bulk of Zelda’s daily income as a validator. However, during the rare days when Zelda is tasked with the responsibility of a block proposal, daily income can increase by up to 67% from the norm.      In the weeks to come, the daily income chart featured in our second graphic will illustrate fluctuations in Zelda’s earnings as a result of her on-chain activity.      Disclaimer: All profits made from CoinDesk’s Eth 2.0 staking venture will be donated to a charity of the company’s choosing once transfers are enabled on the network.    New frontiers: Profitability of DEXs and DeFi applications    Among DeFi applications, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are the most profitable in terms of return for liquidity providers, token holders and protocol treasuries.      The DeFi landscape can be broken down into three broad categories – lending, trading and asset management. These finance-focused applications generate revenue in a similar way to their traditional counterparts, like commercial banks, exchanges and hedge funds. However, by automating financial services with smart contracts and removing the large amount of human capital traditional firms require, DeFi applications can return a greater portion of their revenue to their users.      As of July 18, the market capitalization of DeFi tokens was about $60 billion. Some of the top DeFi protocols by market capitalization, such as Compound, Uniswap and Aave, have generated a combined annual core business revenue of over $1.3 billion in the last year. According to DeFi Llama, those three projects are responsible for around 20% of “Total Value Locked” (TVL) in DeFi. TVL is a metric that captures the idle capital locked in a DeFi protocol, which can be used to borrow or to trade against, or to do both.    Using blockchain data for DeFi revenue analysis    The transparency of blockchains allows for the auditing of every on-chain transaction. Token Terminal uses blockchain data to better understand exactly what each DeFi protocol is doing with the assets they manage and how profitable their strategies are.      Revenue data from Token Terminal is limited to the core business revenue stream of each DeFi protocol and doesn’t capture revenue from other business streams. Marc Zeller, the integrations lead at Aave, told CoinDesk in an interview that beyond revenue generated from Aave’s core business of crypto lending, the protocol has generated roughly $105,000 in fees from flash loans, $234,000 from liquidations and $5.2 million in Aave and Matic liquidity mining incentives since July 13.      For the purposes of revenue analysis in this article, we’ll also limit data to the core business stream of each DeFi protocol. By comparing the core business revenue of DeFi protocols, we can compare the performance of DeFi categories as a whole and see how these decentralized applications match up to their competitors. This type of comparable analysis can also help investors decide which DeFi assets are overvalued and which are undervalued, relative to the market.      Here is a list of definitions and assumptions we used in our revenue analysis:    Revenue is the total monetary value returned to token holders, liquidity providers and the protocol treasury from *only* the core business revenue (i.e. trading fees for decentralized exchanges, borrow interest for decentralized lending protocols).  Earnings is strictly the share of revenue that goes to token holders and the protocol treasury.  Total Value Locked (TVL) is the difference between the total amount deposited and the total amount borrowed from the protocol.  Adjusted Total Value Locked (aTVL) is the total amount deposited into a protocol.    Data for these metrics was aggregated from Token Terminal, DeFi Llama, DeFi Pulse and various other DeFi protocol dashboards such as Compound and Aave.    DEXs versus decentralized lending platforms    The most direct multiples for measuring asset efficiency are Revenue / Adjusted Total Value Locked and Earnings / Adjusted Total Value Locked. The first metric measures the return on assets for all parties, including liquidity providers, token holders and the protocol treasury. The second metric shows cash flow to the protocol alone, which is dependent on the DeFi protocol’s fee structure.      Using Revenue / aTVL to measure return on assets (ROA), Uniswap and SushiSwap, both popular DEXs on Ethereum, are sitting at 29% and 20%, respectively. Aave and Compound fall below, coming in at 2% and 2.7% at the time of writing.      Similar to what happens in traditional finance, ROA differs significantly between industries and does not fully encompass a protocol’s success. Furthermore, because the ROA calculated in our model uses revenue only from the core business of each protocol, the resulting figure could vary if other revenue streams were added.      Even so, ROA metrics within DeFi help visualize the return all stakeholders in the platform have historically received. Using data from the past 180 days annualized, we can see that DEXs are generally the most productive with the assets they have under management and that lending platforms require more capital to generate the same amount of revenue.      Speaking to these results, Henri Hyvärinen, CEO of Token Terminal, noted that dividend distribution models for DEXs and other DeFi protocols are still in their early stages of development.      “The dividend distributions in the [DeFi] crypto market are a bit premature. Most of the protocols are still akin to early stage startups, where the focus should be on reinvesting the money into growth,” Hyvärinen said in an email to CoinDesk.    Validated takes  Anthony Di Iorio, one of the eight co-founders of Ethereum, plans to sell his blockchain software company Decentral Inc. and focus on other business ventures not related to cryptocurrencies. BACKGROUND: Di Iorio is looking to leave the crypto industry over concerns for his personal safety. He also mentioned that he wanted to focus on “larger problems,” stating that cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology are only “a small percentage of what the world needs.” (Article, Bloomberg)  After months of parabolic growth, the supply of dollar-backed stablecoin tether (USDT) has suddenly stopped climbing. BACKGROUND: Since the end of May, the market capitalization of USDT has stayed constant at just over $63 billion, while tether’s largest competitor, USDC, has shown modest supply growth from $22 billion to $26 billion over the same time period. One possible reason for the lack of supply growth in USDT is mounting user mistrust over the token’s reserve composition. (Article, CoinDesk)  Long-standing cryptocurrency management platform Shapeshift is executing a radical plan to fully decentralize its operations.

42387292,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmR5v,1626861895,"Bitcoin Retakes $31K as Traditional Markets See Risk Reset, BNY Mellon Makes Crypto Push","Bitcoin has climbed above $31,000 alongside gains in global equity markets and fresh evidence of growing demand for cryptocurrency from traditional market participants. However, it may be too early to call a trend reversal higher.      The biggest cryptocurrency by market value was changing hands at about $31,300 at press time, a 5% gain on the day, according to CoinDesk 20 data. The bounce comes a day after the cryptocurrency printed its first UTC close below $30,000 since New Year's day and may have caught out some traders.      There was concern in the market that put-option sellers might take short positions in the spot/futures market on a break below $30,000, amplifying the price drop. Further, fund holdings dropped in the lead up to bitcoin's break below $30,000, signaling the absence of dip demand from large investors and higher odds of a continued sell-off.      Still, the dip below $30,000 was shallow and short-lived, possibly because of the return to risky assets in traditional markets. The U.S. equity market jumped over 1% on Tuesday as the focus shifted from concern about the Delta coronavirus variant to growth, lifting banks and industrial stocks, according to the Financial Times. Futures tied to the S&P 500 are pointing to a positive open on Wednesday, with a 0.65% gain, according to Investing.com.      Bitcoin crossed above $30,000 early today. Buying pressure strengthened, pushing the cryptocurrency above $31,000, after Financial Times reported that Bank of New York Mellon had joined State Street and four other banks in backing the planned cryptocurrency trading platform Pure Digital.      Earlier this month, BNY Mellon, the largest custodian bank in the U.S., entered into an agreement with Grayscale Investments to handle accounting and administration services for the digital asset manager. Grayscale is a unit of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk. Many investment banks have announced plans to launch crypto services this year, citing a surge in interest from their clients.      Crypto market sentiment may have also received a boost from the crypto derivatives exchange FTX's record $900 million fundraising round at an $18 billion valuation. The big number highlights long-term conviction in the crypto industry, even though bitcoin, the industry leader, has lost more than half of its value since mid-April.      Some in the crypto community are associating the price recovery with the impending bitcoin-centered conference ""The ₿ Word"" scheduled for Wednesday. According to reports, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, one of the most famous crypto proponents, will participate in a live discussion with Square CEO Jack Dorsey and ARK Investment founder Cathie Wood.      ""Bitcoin bottoming just below Elon Musk's entry price the day before he hosts a big conference to talk about Bitcoin sounds like something that would feel very obvious in retrospect,"" one popular trader tweeted.      Nevertheless, some analysts remain cautious. ""Bitcoin is still just chopping around,"" Joel Kruger, a currency strategist at LMAX Digital, said. ""I still think there is a risk for one more decent decline, but we’d need to see a break below the June low of $28,800 to trigger such a move.""      Bitcoin still remains well below the crucial 50-day moving average (MA) resistance. ""Bitcoin has been grinding lower below its down trending 50-day MA, which can be considered initial resistance near $35,000, a breakout above which would target the 200-day MA near $44,000,"" Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, said in a weekly research note published Monday.      On the downside, the June low of $28,800 is a key support level. ""Everyone is talking about $30,000 like it’s a big deal, but in reality, it’s the June low at $28,800 which is the key level to watch,"" Kruger said.      A breakdown may bring a quick sell-off to the former hurdle-turned-support at $20,000. ""The area between $20,000 and $30,000 is lightly traded, there is fresh air between these levels,"" Charlie Morris, ByteTree Asset Management's founder and chief investment officer, noted in a blog post published Tuesday. ""Price is supposed to move slowly through the heavy areas, and quickly through the light ones.""

The move comes as euro-backed stablecoin demand has been increasing, with Tether rivals such as Stasis' EURS token siphoning some of Tether's dominant market share.  Overall demand for USDT and EURT has somewhat lessened in recent weeks on the back of regulatory pressure in China and an increase in stablecoin competition.  Still, Paolo Ardoino, Tether's chief technology officer, said he “anticipate(s) a ready uptake of EURT on Bitstamp.""

42387301,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmRIV,1626849522,US Patent Granted to Stablecoin Concept Backed by Government Debt,"The two co-founders of the Puerto Rico-based digital FV Bank say they have become the first in history to be awarded a U.S. patent for a stablecoin design based solely on government debt.      The patent application, filed last year on the back of a pre-existing patent by Nitin Agarwal and Miles Paschini, describes their instrument as a ""tokenized crypto asset backed by sovereign debt.""      Its working name is Yuga Coin, which in Sanskrit means the ""joining of two things,"" or in this case, ""generations,"" Agarwal told CoinDesk in an interview on Tuesday.      ""We aim to create multiple stablecoins that are government-friendly, know-your-customer (KYC), anti-money laundering and Financial Action Task Force (FATF) compliant based on different currencies,"" Agarwal said.      Each coin will be redeemable 1:1 against a corresponding national currency where they will be backed by national treasury instruments (including bonds and Treasury notes) of the corresponding country.      Those stablecoins, intended to be created under the same Sanskrit banner and denominated in U.S. dollars or euros at first, would be traded in a controlled network adjusted to rate the risk of trading with particular counterparties.      The argument goes that these would be more stable than other cryptos pegged to a fiat currency because they won't rely on a single financial institution holding the collateral. ""The stability of the tokenized crypto asset is more akin to the stability of the government debt,"" the patent reads.      While the market is now flooded with various versions of stablecoins pegged to either commodities or fiat currency (think USDT and USDC), the competition for such an instrument pegged to government debt is scarce.      ""Avanti Bank (Caitlin Long) does speak about stablecoins backed by banks, which hold all funds in government securities and no fractional reserves,"" Agarwal said, referring to Avanti Bank & Trust, a bank Long founded that serves as a custodian for digital assets. ""However, in order to make this multinational and multicurrency, the bottleneck of a bank has to be removed, which is the approach we are taking.""      A push to become more compliant in the eyes of regulators is at the fore of many crypto entrepreneurs' minds in their pursuit of legitimacy. The FATF recently updated its guidance requiring virtual assets and their providers to comply with the same rules as traditional financial institutions.      Pandering to that notion, Yuga Coin also seeks to incorporate regulatory-approved identity verification standards and an incorporated risk score similar to that of a FICO credit score in traditional finance.      Agarwal said Yuga Coins would be verified by a regulated and trusted entity that is later recorded on-chain. Once a person has a verified identity in their wallet, the end user is then in control of who can view their identity verification.      ""We conceptualized this about three years back when the stablecoins market cap was less than $10 billion,"" Agarwal said. ""Today we see more people realizing this is the right way to run a stablecoin.""      The intention is to facilitate international government to corporations transactions, inter-government transfers fostering trade, global business-to-business and retail transactions, and as a store of value among individuals.      Agarwal describes the design's potential as possessing ""innumerable possibilities"" capable of providing a trusted means of holding and transacting money enabling ""multiple innovations.""      ""This is the only way to make stablecoins more government-friendly that foster innovation in banking, payments, finance, capital markets and asset registry by using blockchain,"" said Agarwal, noting that such stablecoins would be global, decentralized and immutable and would make transactions easy to audit.      ""Crypto is a solution to all anti-money laundering problems in the world, and this project provides a way to achieve that,"" he said.

Pingan's local subsidiary has developed a COVID-19 insurance plan for medical staff in Shenzhen's Nanshan district. Users who pay their premiums in e-CNY can receive discounts, the Shenzhen Special Zone Daily reported.  The policy covers 300,000 yuan ($46,342) for death caused by the coronavirus, 50,000 ($7,723) yuan for a COVID-19 diagnosis and 50,000 yuan for accidental death.  While this is not the first time the digital RMB has been tested in the insurance sector, it is likely the first time an e-CNY insurance trial has been open to the public.  In December, local media reported that some digital yuan trial participants could use the digital yuan to buy insurance on Zhong An's app. That trial was conducted in collaboration with China Construction Bank. Zhong An is an online insurance provider.  Pingan will continue to test the use of the digital yuan in insurance payments and claims settlement, a person familiar with the matter told Shenzhen Special Zone Daily.  China's digital RMB has so far been tested in a variety of retail scenarios, such as merchant payments and metro systems, as well as with payrolls.

42387300,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmRFz,1626843692,"Canada CBDC 'Probably Necessary' for Competition, Central Bank Says in Paper","A central bank digital currency is ""probably necessary"" for a competitive digital economy, the Bank of Canada said in a staff paper published Tuesday.    A CBDC would give consumers a non-bank option to store their money risk-free, increasing competition in the market for retail deposits, argue the authors of the paper, titled ""The Positive Case for a CBDC.""  A digital currency would also allow users to bypass payment services providers such as credit cards, which antitrust watchdogs globally have said exhibit anticompetitive practices, the central bank said.  The digital currency might be a ""measured path"" to combat big tech monopolies, the authors argue.  Central banks around the world are studying the feasibility of a digital currency, with China having made the most progress. The total number of transactions using the digital yuan as of the end of June was about 71 million, spread among almost 21 million personal wallets and 3.5 million enterprise wallets, the People’s Bank of China said in a white paper last week, in which it confirmed smart contract programmability.  The Bank of Canada paper argues that CBDCs endowed with programmability through smart contracts will engender vibrant innovation and competition in digital services.  The bank also noted that smart contracts come with risks, including software bugs, vulnerability to cyberattacks, scalability issues and the difficulty of bringing off-chain data into the blockchain.  The central bank reiterated its previous position that there are two potential scenarios under which it might issue a CBDC in Canada. Those would be because cash was no longer widely used in Canada or because an alternative digital currency was so widely used that it threatened the country's monetary sovereignty. The bank said the latter scenario is unlikely.  But even if a CBDC is issued, anticompetitive regulation would likely still be necessary, the paper said.
