Bitcoin Has Been Forming A Bull Flag Pattern Recently In a new post on X, analyst Ali has discussed about a bull flag recently forming in the 4-hour price of the cryptocurrency. The “bull flag” here refers to a pattern in technical analysis that, as its name implies, looks like a flag on a pole. In this pattern, a sharp uptrend is succeeded by a period of consolidation towards the downside. The uptrend makes up for the pole, while the consolidation period acts as the flag. Related Reading: Dogecoin Soars 17% To Break $0.21 As Volume Explodes When the price is trapped inside the flag, it tends to find resistance at its upper line, so tops may be probable to form there. Similarly, the lower line may act as support, thus facilitating for bottoms to take shape. The bull flag is usually considered to be a continuation pattern, meaning that the prevailing trend (that is, the trend of the flag) would continue once the consolidation period is over. This happens when a break above the resistance line takes place. The uptrend emerging out of such a break may be of the same height as the pole. If the asset falls under the support line, though, the pattern could be considered invalidated. Like the bull flag, there is also the bear flag pattern, which works similarly except for the fact that the pole in this case corresponds to a downtrend while the flag is generally a consolidation channel angled upwards. Just like the bull flag, a continuation of the prevailing bearish trend may follow this formation. Now, here is the chart shared by Ali that shows the bull flag that BTC’s 4-hour price has recently been consolidating inside: Looks like the price of the asset has been breaking out of this pattern recently | Source: @ali_charts on X From the graph, it’s visible that the 4-hour Bitcoin price has appeared to have been consolidating inside this bull flag over the last few days. It’s also apparent that, in the past day, BTC has been climbing above the resistance line of the pattern. This could mean that the cryptocurrency is preparing a break out of this formation. Naturally, the asset would have to show more momentum before the breakout can be confirmed. Related Reading: Bitcoin “Liquid Inventory Ratio” Hits All-Time Low, What It Means “If BTC holds above $70,000, we could see a surge of nearly 10% to a new all-time high of $77,000!” says Ali. The analyst has chosen this target as such a swing would be of the same length as the pole that had preceded this flag. BTC Price Bitcoin has so far been heading in a direction that would add more credence to the breakout, as its price has now broken past the $71,300 level. With this surge, BTC investors would be enjoying profits of more than 7% over the past week.

This price movement has prompted traders and analysts to ponder on when SHIB can reach the much coveted $0.0001 mark, a price level which it has largely failed to reach despite the impressive price action. Micheal_EWPro, a crypto analyst, posted an analysis on when SHIB could potentially reach the $0.0001 price level. According to him, the current dynamics could push SHIB above $0.0001 in June. Interestingly, his price prediction is based on the Elliott Wave Theory. Analyst Reveals SHIB Is Going To $0.0001 According to the SHIB chart shared by Michael on the 3-day candlestick formation, the meme coin’s price formation since 2022 has largely followed the Elliott Wave count. The Elliot Wave Theory is basically a technical analysis method that analyses price movement traditionally in terms of a 5-wave move in the direction of the larger trend and a 3-wave correction in the opposite trend. Related Reading: XRP Price Enters Pre-Bull Rally Phase: Crypto Analyst Reveals Next Target Each of these Elliott Wave can be further subdivided into various patterns of smaller degree impulses based on their formations. However, all the subdivisions add up to one larger wave impulse. Using this knowledge of Elliot Wave Theory, the analyst noted that SHIB has started the formation of the third of five larger degree waves since October 2023 albeit with smaller degree impulses which he labelled as i, ii, iii, iv, and v. Traditionally, the third Elliot Wave is usually the largest and most powerful wave in a trend where most of the price action takes place. As a result, his analysis points to the third wave ending at a price just above $0.0001 in the first week of June. The analyst did implore a take-profit at $0.00008854 and a final price target of $0.00010191, while also noting that the bulls still have some work to do before this price point can come to a reality. $SHIB bulls got a little work to do here on 3D but after that I think it sends to my sub 5 TP pic.twitter.com/YQLQqw8bxH — BigMike7335 (@Michael_EWpro) March 24, 2024 What’s Next For Shiba Inu?

As the crypto market recovers from its slowdown, with Bitcoin (BTC) leading the way, the dog-themed token appears to be preparing to take off. Related Reading: Dogecoin Soars 17% To Break $0.21 As Volume Explodes Analysts Share Bullish Forecasts For FLOKI’s Future Two weeks ago, analysts considered that FLOKI was showing a strong performance amid the crypto market slowdown. The token, which has been on an upward trajectory since the end of February, “held up nicely” at the time. While most of the market registered considerable dips, FLOKI was one of the tokens “consolidating before another expansion.” Halfway through the month, the Viking dog-themed cryptocurrency had shown a 337% growth since March 1st, after hovering between $0.000028-$0.000039 for the first two months of 2024. Now that March is near its end, FLOKI exhibits a staggering 428.3% increase in the last 30 days. This performance didn’t go unnoticed by crypto analysts, who forecast new heights for the token. MacroCRG, a crypto trader and market analyst, shared his thoughts on the token’s price. The analyst considers that beyond FLOKI’s impressive performance throughout the month, it was “showing strength on LTF’s too.” $DOGE leading the charge, just hit a fresh 121 week high This is wildly bullish for other blue chip memes$FLOKI showing strength on LTF's too As long as this recent low holds, fresh highs soon IMO pic.twitter.com/cmPn89x7a7 — CRG (@MacroCRG) March 28, 2024 In the post’s chart, the trader highlighted the performance since Monday, pointing out the token’s support zone above the $0.00022 price range.

In the last 24 hours, the token has increased 9.8%, trading at $0.0002554. Despite the remarkable long-term performance and the recent surge, the token is still registering a 10.6% correction from its performance in the biweekly timeframe. Its market capitalization rose to $2.39 billion, an 8.4% surge in the past day.

42391053,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69be9fzx,1711653718,Is This the End of Bitcoin's 4-Year Bull/Bear Market Cycle?,"With Bitcoin's halving event just around the corner, it certainly seems like we're on the cusp of something big. While everyone's eyes are glued to the skyrocketing bitcoin {{BTC}} price and the possibility of record-breaking highs, the ripple effects are far-reaching. They will touch every corner of the crypto market, and could even signal an end to crypto’s four-year bull/bear cycle.  This feature is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package published to coincide with the fourth Bitcoin “halving” in April 2024.  Daniel Polotsky is the founder of CoinFlip.  Yet, it's not just about the numbers; it's about the potential for a seismic shift in how we perceive and interact with digital currency. Brace yourself — this could be the beginning of a whole new era for crypto.  Bitcoin's ascendance  Bitcoin's value has surged of late, buoyed by anticipation surrounding the upcoming halving event in April, alongside milestones like the approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S. and major financial institutions such as BlackRock publicly entering the space. This institutional interest has led to unprecedented demand, with bitcoin hitting a new all-time high above $73,000 on March 13. This was likely driven by record-breaking inflows into ETFs, including a $1.045 billion influx on March 12.  This transition marks a more widespread acknowledgment of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset category, marking the onset of a new phase in institutional investment. It has also further bolstered Bitcoin's credibility and accessibility to retail investors.  These landmark developments enable investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities associated with direct ownership. The increased liquidity and stability will likely continue to attract a broader range of investors, driving greater mainstream adoption and helping further fuel the current surge in bitcoin's valuation.  See also: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Are Just the Beginning for Wall Street | Opinion  There are, of course, still bears out there. Yet, with projections ranging from $150,000 to $250,000 per coin, the bitcoin market is on the brink of a substantial inflow of institutional capital. This will signal a potential transformation in its historical cyclic dynamic that would drive new levels of growth and innovation across multiple digital asset sectors.  Every silver lining has a touch of gray  Despite the apparent bullish momentum in the cryptocurrency market, several factors could disrupt this trajectory. Persistent inlation may prompt tighter monetary policies, affecting riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Sluggish economic growth could also dent investor confidence, diverting attention from speculative investments.  Another short-term concern lies in the bitcoin mining industry. The upcoming 2024 halving event is expected to trigger significant consolidation and defaults, as cash-strapped mining firms will struggle with slimmer profit margins and high operational expenses. This could force them to dump their bitcoin as they enter bankruptcy, which may keep the price down. Additionally, regulatory oversight and lack of funding pose challenges, potentially exerting downward pressure on prices.  Uncertainty surrounding the 2024 elections adds yet another layer of unpredictability. Political outcomes could lead to varying regulatory changes, with potential shifts in the U.S. government's stance towards cryptocurrencies. While a Republican presidency may offer a more favorable regulatory environment, Democrats might become more receptive to the industry due to alignment with values like financial inclusivity and environmental sustainability. This may potentially foster bipartisan support for cryptocurrency regulation.  The end of the crypto boom/bust cycle?  Maybe most tantalizing of all could be the unanticipated secondary effects of the halving. While historically a driver of bullish cycles, the halving's impact may be overshadowed by the other factors mentioned above, such as staggering ETF net inflows. Total net inflows have surpassed $15 billion.  The strategic intervention of institutions and retail ETF investors guided by more experienced financial advisors adept at “buying the dip,” looms large as a factor that could potentially dampen the halving's effectiveness in driving the market forward.  This would mean the end of crypto’s typical four year bull/bear cycle, seemingly tied to the bitcoin halving, and instead suggest a trajectory of relatively stable upward growth, with ETF inflows emerging as the primary catalyst for crypto adoption. It's notable that this is the first time bitcoin's price has rocketed up before the halving, which in year's prior has preceded bitcoin bull runs.  This shift could have profound effects across the industry. Initially, crypto's ethos was rooted in a countercultural resistance against centralized currencies and institutions with the mantra ""not your keys, not your coin."" Now it seems the predominant force in crypto could soon be controlled by a handful of institutions, with ownership dispersed among individuals who lack access to their own keys — contrary to the original ideals of decentralization.  A tilt towards institutional ownership could lead to something even bigger: the ownership of bitcoin by sovereign nations. More countries may follow El Salvador's lead and initiate a race to accumulate cryptocurrency, potentially initiating a global mainstream adoption super cycle.  See also: Qatar's Sovereign Fund Might Be Buying Bitcoin  This change might also lead to a departure from the intense boom-and-bust cycles traditionally associated with cryptocurrency markets, fostering a more stable environment for growth and development within the sector.  While fewer retail investors will experience the euphoria of a bull market, the good news is that they will also be spared the brutal reality of buying at the peak and getting their face ripped off as the market plummets.  This new stability could provide crypto companies and projects with the opportunity to focus on sustainable, long-term development, rather than timing market cycles and facing extreme headwinds during crypto winters.  As investors and enthusiasts prepare for heightened volatility, it's evident that the market is on the brink of unprecedented growth and, potentially, a fundamental paradigm shift. While it is bittersweet, this upcoming period could be viewed as the end of cryptocurrency's infancy, marking a significant evolution in its history. Before saying goodbye, we should all be ready to celebrate its Last Dance.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Dan Polotsky,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/03/28/is-this-the-end-of-bitcoins-4-year-bullbear-market-cycle,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1c58fc7f56689a9fb13c417b5b99c732750052c6-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

24920044,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=600190,1711652445,Why BlackRock Could Bet On This RWA Token: Crypto Analyst,"In an era where the boundaries between traditional finance (TradFi) and crypto continue to blur, the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) stands out as one of the hottest trends. This trend, which allows tangible assets like vehicles and real estate to be bought and sold as tokens on a blockchain, promises to revolutionize the efficiency and speed of asset transactions. Just last week, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has positioned itself at the forefront of this movement with the launch of a $100 million tokenization fund, which has already attracted over $240 million in investment within its first week. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, has been vocal about the potential of tokenization, stating that RWAs “could revolutionize, again, finance.” This comment has contributed to a notable surge in the valuation of several RWA crypto tokens in recent weeks. In light of these developments, crypto analysts from Layergg have identified a specific crypto project that they believe could garner significant interest from BlackRock. Why BlackRock Could Choose Aptos The project in question is Aptos, which has been earmarked for its potential in the RWA space. According to Layergg’s analysis shared on X (formerly Twitter), the narrative surrounding RWA and tokenization, bolstered by BlackRock’s involvement, suggests a nascent yet rapidly growing interest in this sector. They highlight that mid to low cap RWA projects listed on Binance have performed exceptionally well, indicating a broader market interest spurred by narrative-driven investment strategies. However, the favorite crypto project for BlackRock could be Aptos. Related Reading: Crypto Exec Reveals Why Meme Coins Are The Next ‘Trojan Horse’ For Crypto Adoption A closer look at Aptos reveals several factors that might make it an attractive partner for BlackRock. Firstly, Aptos is poised to make a significant announcement related to RWA in April, coinciding with the Aptos DeFi DAYS event from April 2 to 5. This announcement is speculated to involve a partnership with a global asset management firm, potentially BlackRock. “A partnership with a global asset management firm is expected to be announced. It is speculated that this may include BlackRock,” the analysts remarked. The basis for this speculation includes Aptos CEO Mo Shaikh’s previous tenure at BlackRock, suggesting pre-existing industry connections that could facilitate such a partnership. Moreover, Aptos founder Mo Shaikh & head of ecosystem at Aptos Labs Neil H hinted at this early on. In mid-February Shaikh revealed via X: “I sat down with three of the world’s largest asset managers this week A little preview…while the year started with ETFs, it will conclude with RWA on-chain en masse, growth in Asia and all using parallelisation on Aptos See you in Hong Kong.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Next Stop $80,000? Crypto Analyst Sees BTC Soaring Ahead Of 2024 Halving On February 21, Shaikh also commented on a post on X by Dan Morehead, founder and managing partner at Pantera Capital. Morehead stated, “Tomorrow I’ll be speaking at BlackRock’s Institutional Digital Assets Summit. The existence of that Summit **IS** the massive change. Really excited about this.” Mo Shaikh mysteriously commented, “There’s Summit to this.” Besides that, Adam Cader, founder of Thala Labs recently stated via X that “something is cooking for Aptos. I’m a co-founder of the largest application on the network, and here’s my list of upcoming significant ecosystem wide catalysts.” Cader referenced Shaikh’s statement and added that Blackrock, Vanguard, and Fidelity are the three largest asset managers in the world. “If I had to guess this refers to either them using the chain in some way / integrating it into one of their products which has precedent in the TradFi world. Also note Blackrock is the most crypto-aligned of the bunch,” he said via X. Crypto Revolution: Will APT Follow AVAX? But that’s not all. Aptos has been hinted to explore partnerships with other major asset management firms, including Franklin Templeton, which has previously invested in Aptos (tier 3) and planned to utilize its blockchain for money market funds. Such strategic alliances could position Aptos similarly to how Avalanche benefited from its partnerships in the Project Guardian initiative (JPMorgan and Wisdomtree), experiencing a substantial price increase post-announcement. “Avalanche saw a price increase of more than 4x following the ‘Project Guardian’ news,” Layergg noted. They concluded, “If a partnership with BlackRock proceeds, more ‘Big partnerships’ will naturally follow.” At press time, APT traded at $17.59, up 87% over the past five weeks.

24918112,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=600132,1711648831,Dogecoin Holder Base Reaches New Record Amid Surge In Interest,"Dogecoin has soared toward a new record in one notable metric as interest in the meme coin continues to surge. This time around, the holder base of the cryptocurrency has reached a new all-time high, signaling rapid adoption among crypto investors. Dogecoin Holders Cross 6.9 Million The month of March has come with glad tidings for Dogecoin. Not only has the meme coin’s price risen tremendously this month, its holder base has also seen a lot of growth. This month, the total DOGE holder base crossed 6.9 million for the very first time, setting a new record. However, the meme coin is not anywhere near done as the number continues to rise. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Cardano Price Is Struggling Below $0.7 According to data from the Coincarp website, the number of Dogecoin holders on the mainnet has reached 6,932,763 as of March 28. Given the growth rate of the number of holders over the last month, the number could cross 7 million before the month of March is over. This new record is a testament to the adoption that DOGE has witnessed over the last few months. Despite competitors such as BONK, PEPE, and WIF springing out of the woodwork, as well as its fiercest rival, Shiba Inu, continuing to put up a fight, Dogecoin has dominated as the leading meme coin. To put this growth in perspective, the DOGE holder base started out the year 2024 with around 6.06 million holders. Three months later, it is more than 6.9 million, meaning that the holder base grew more than 14% during this time. DOGE Outlook Continues To Be Bullish In addition to the rapid rise in Dogecoin holders, there has been a notable uptick in other metrics, such as daily transaction counts, whale transactions, and age consumed. These point to a rise in bullish sentiment among investors who expect the price to keep going up. Related Reading: Fifth Largest Bitcoin Whale Moves $6 Billion In BTC, Here’s The Destination The age consumed is particularly important here since it shows that more investors are choosing to hold their DOGE tokens for the longer term. This has significantly reduced the selling pressure on the meme coin, allowing it to rally at a time when most of the crypto market remains suppressed. Another metric that has shown a significant increase is the daily transaction volume which is up almost 50% in the last day. This uptick shows more interest in trading Dogecoin and with its price surging in the last day, it suggests that the majority of this volume is skewed toward buying rather than selling. The DOGE price is currently reflecting this surge in interest as its price is up almost 10% in the last day. However, the bears continue to maintain resistance around $0.2, forcing the meme coin back downward.

His deliberate and ongoing lies demonstrated a brazen disregard for customers' expectations and disrespect for the rule of law, all so that he could secretly use his customers' money to expand his own power and influence.  The scale of his crimes is measured not just by the amount of money that was stolen, but by the extraordinary harm caused to victims, who in some cases had their life savings wiped out overnight. As a result of his unprecedented fraud, Bankman-Fried faces 25 years in prison, forfeiture of over a billion dollars and restitution to his victims.  Today's sentence will prevent the defendant from ever again committing fraud and is an important message to others who might be tempted to engage in financial crimes that justice will be swift, and the consequences will be severe.

42391057,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69be9gFL,1711645712,Ethereum Hit by 'Blobscriptions' in First Stress Test of Blockchain's New Data System,"The Ethereum blockchain just a couple weeks ago completed a landmark upgrade to create a dedicated space for storing data – known as ""blobs,"" under a plan to reduce fees while also relieving congestion.  But already, a new project has come along to jam up the so-called blob space, sending fees soaring and providing the nascent blob market with its first big stress test.  Ethereum gas fees for blobs spiked Wednesday after a project called Ethscriptions created a new way of inscribing data, or minting inscriptions, on the data blobs, called “blobscriptions.”  According to the Dune Analytics dashboard, the blob base fee soared to at least 582 gwei ($266) on Wednesday. As of writing on Thursday, the blob base fee had subsided to around 18 gwei ($8.69).  “As widely predicted, it looks like March 27, 2024, will be remembered as the day that the ‘blobs are free EIP-4844 launch discount’ party came to a close – courtesy of Blob Inscriptions,” Matt Cutler, the CEO of Blocknative, wrote on X.  EIP-4844 is the name of the proposal that ushered in the new blob market, incorporated as part of Ethereum's landmark Dencun upgrade completed on March 13.  The blob space is especially crucial for the myriad layer-2 networks like Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon and Coinbase's Base that have been built atop Ethereum to process transactions more quickly and cheaply than is possible on the main chain. As part of the process, the layer 2s need to park reams of data on Ethereum, accounting for a huge portion of their overall costs.  In a blog post on Thursday, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin acknowledged that the Blobscriptions episode had pushed the new blob-fee market into ""price discovery mode,"" but he added that the data fees still remained far cheaper than they would have been under the old system of parking data as ""calldata"" in a regular Ethereum transaction.  ""Blobs are not free, but they remain much cheaper than calldata,"" Buterin wrote. “From here, important scaling work, both in increasing blob count and in improving rollups' ability to make the best use of each blob, will continue to take place, but it will be more incremental.”  Read more: Ethereum Finalizes 'Dencun' Upgrade, in Landmark Move to Reduce Data Fees",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | ARB,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/03/28/ethereum-hit-by-blobscriptions-in-first-stress-test-of-blockchains-new-data-system,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/33d00ecd9875a40520a60fef82754d686dcb17b8-1922x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The announcement also featured the collaboration of the MotoGP racing team Gresini Racing as its first enterprise client. By collaborating with Gresini Racing, an enormous fan base will be offered digital collectibles through the MaaS platform. VeChain To Onboard A Rapid Tokenizing World With the launch of its No-Code Tokenized Asset Marketplace (MaaS) platform, VeChain has made tremendous progress toward increasing mass adoption of blockchain technology. VeChain’s continuous goal to promote widespread blockchain technology adoption by removing technological hurdles is consistent with this user-friendly strategy. Since its founding, VeChain has created several use cases powered by blockchain applications. These include product authentification, creating new digital communication channels, provenance and sustainability traceability, and others. This demonstrates its understanding of the tremendous potential that its technologies have for Web 3. Related Reading: Big Banks Push for More Bitcoin (BTC) Exposure, VeChain (VET) and NuggetRush (NUGX) Lead the Top Gainers Given the rise in demand for tokenizing Real-World assets (RWAs) solutions, the introduction of MaaS seems appropriate. Furthermore, NFC functionality and support for “Phygitals,” or real-world physical assets with NFT/digital counterparts, will be added later in the platform. Specifically, this innovation was created to significantly influence the digital asset market. It aims to provide enterprise and individual builders with an “easy-to-use white-label NFT platform for digital asset sales” and transfers that require little to no programming. MaaS applications are diverse and address the increasing need for platforms that enable asset tokenization. Blackrock‘s latest application for a Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization fund highlighted this path. So far, the No-Code Tokenized Asset Marketplace-as-a-Service platform (MaaS) is expected to be fully operational later this year. VET Is On A Downtrend Despite the launch of MaaS, VeChain (VET) is witnessing a daily downtrend of nearly 2%. However, in the weekly timeframe, the crypto asset has increased by over 5%, suggesting an upward move. Related Reading: VeChain Ready For Big Moves: Analyst Identifies Key Factors That Will Drive VET To New ATH As of the time of writing, VET was trading at $0.0440, with its market cap dropping by 2.78% in the past day.

42391046,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69be9fQ3,1711644570,Sam Bankman-Fried Deserves a Life After Prison,"It is patently absurd that Sam Bankman-Fried asked to receive no more than 6.5 years for what could be appropriately described as the crime of the century. It is also laughable that, in arguing for a lighter sentence, his newly hired defense counsel made appeals to SBF’s autism and veganism, and made hay of the full restitution his victims are likely to receive. A man’s diet is not a basis for leniency, and moreso, the FTX estate was able recover some, but not all, of the billions of dollars worth of missing assets, not because of Bankman-Fried’s help, but in spite of it.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  ""There are plenty of things we did not get back, like the bribes to Chinese officials or the hundreds of millions of dollars he spent to buy access to or time with celebrities or politicians or investments for which he grossly overpaid having done zero diligence,"" FTX CEO John J. Ray III, who is overseeing the exchange’s bankruptcy process, wrote in a March 20 memo. ""The harm was vast. The remorse is nonexistent.""  Yet, to serve Sam Bankman-Fried with what would amount to a virtual life sentence would also have been insane. According to U.S. sentencing guidelines, Bankman-Fried faced up to 110 years in prison. The Department of Justice prosecutors who tried the case sought a 40-50 year sentence for SBF’s guilt in two counts of fraud and five counts of conspiracy. As Judge Lewis Kaplan said, “that would be more than necessary,” as he handed down a 25-year sentence.  Public opinion on the matter (such as it is) appears split, with many saying the sentence is too lenient. SBF will need to serve at least 85% of the 25 years, meaning the 32-year-old could walk in his early 50s. SBF violated the trust of his investors, customers and own employees. Dozens of victim statements speak to the shock and financial distress he caused, and the countless lives he threw off course. Judge Kaplan also ruled SBF attempted to obstruct justice, and perjured himself three times.  And yet, as the verdict is handed down today, the crypto industry might do well to wish SBF well. Putting aside the grisly statistics and realities of life in federal penitentiaries — including that the United States incarcerates five times more people per capita than most other countries, and the racial disparity in criminal justice — robbing SBF of his entire life for a non-violent crime would have been unconscionable. This is likely an unpopular opinion, given the harm SBF has caused to many crypto holders and the industry at large.  There is no point in arguing SBF’s guilt; whether or not he intended to deceive the world is moot. Significant harm was done. There is also no reason to believe SBF’s arguments that he could help clients better than the highly-paid bankruptcy lawyers currently doing that job. It’s clear SBF made no attempt to protect or recover clients’ funds until after the fraud was exposed. Likewise, there is no point in trying to answer the question of whether SBF, motivated by utilitarian aims of doing the most good in the world, turned bad or started that way.  There is also almost no viable defense of SBF that could be made. The dozens of character witnesses in his favor who painted a picture of a smart kid who got in over his head, or who is too sweet for hard prison life, are largely unconvincing. Barbara Fried, SBF’s mother, wrote that Sam is an “angel of mercy” who carries the pain of the world in his depressed mind, without any reference to his victims. And his charitable works don't count for anything; it's easy to give away other peoples’ money.  But wishing for someone to be locked up for decades — to never again have the opportunity to redeem themselves or make an attempt to do right is odd. Incarceration serves a few purposes: retribution for harms done to society, deterrence for others to commit similar crimes and as a matter of public safety. The prosecutors tried to argue there was a “significant likelihood” Bankman-Fried would commit more crimes upon release, asking for him to be locked up into his 80s.  See also: Lyn Ulbricht — Put America's Geeks to Work, Don't Cage Them | Opinion  Prison can also serve another purpose: reform. Although SBF’s lawyer Marc Mukasey told the judge that the FTX founder wasn’t a “ruthless financial serial killer” who set out to rob his customers, only a mind-reader could say for certain what his intentions were. It’s clear enough that SBF began dipping from customer accounts within a year of spinning up the FTX futures exchange and has expressed little remorse for his crimes. But, as human rights lawyer Clive Stafford Smith said: “Never judge a person only by their worst action.”  Demonizing SBF, sometimes called the “face of crypto,” is in effect a demonization of crypto in general. Crypto fans should hope that SBF is reformed and feels remorse in time, in the same way the industry itself should work to rid itself of fraud. I cannot comment on whether SBF’s effective altruism was ever sincere, but I want to believe there is the possibility of goodness in him, in the same way that crypto supporters believe that crypto can affect good in the world, despite its detractors.  In short: SBF deserves a life after prison.

24914725,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=600243,1711642482,BREAKING: Sam Bankman-Fried Sentenced To 25 Years In Prison,"In a highly anticipated courtroom verdict, Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for defrauding users. US District Judge Lewis Kaplan delivered the judgment during a Lower Manhattan federal courtroom hearing. Related Reading: The Bulls Are Back: Spot Bitcoin Inflows Surge With New Records FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried Sentenced Judge Kaplan sternly criticized the defense’s argument, labeling it as “misleading, logically flawed, and speculative.” As reported by our sister site, Bitcoinist, Kaplan highlighted Bankman-Fried’s obstruction of justice and witness tampering during his defense, which were significant factors considered in the sentencing decision. Bankman-Fried expressed remorse in a statement, acknowledging that his series of “selfish” decisions as the leader of FTX had led to the exchange’s downfall. He admitted to having “thrown it all away” and expressed regret that continues to haunt him daily. Prosecutors had initially sought a maximum sentence of 50 years, while Bankman-Fried’s legal team argued for a maximum of 6 years. In November, Bankman-Fried was found guilty on seven criminal counts, and he has since been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. Life Plans Shattered Late Tuesday, prosecutors submitted documents containing testimonies from victims, shedding light on the impact of Bankman-Fried’s actions. One victim, whose name was redacted, wrote a letter dated March 15, describing the destruction of their entire life and the emotional toll it had taken on their family. They emphasized that they had entrusted their funds to FTX as a custodian, not consenting to the risks Bankman-Fried had taken with their money. The victim shared the suffering that had led to depression and even thoughts of suicide. Related Reading: Fantom: Market Slowdown Chops Off 10% From Gains – Here’s Why During the trial, prosecutors revealed that Bankman-Fried had diverted funds from FTX customers, amounting to as much as $8 billion.

In a post on X, the founder shared a snapshot suggesting that Bitcoin “old whales” might be shifting their holdings to “new whales,” mainly traditional finance heavyweights like Fidelity and BlackRock. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently approved these new whales to list spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for all investors. “Old Whales” Moving Coins: Selling Or Risk Mitigation? While a definitive sell-off isn’t confirmed, commentators replying to the founder’s post believe these “old whales” could be mitigating risk. In their assessment, moving their Bitcoin stash from self-custody to a regulated investment vehicle like spot Bitcoin ETFs is a better measure of covering unexpected eventualities. Related Reading: Crypto Exec Reveals Why Meme Coins Are The Next ‘Trojan Horse’ For Crypto Adoption If this is the approach, then it could prove strategic. Bitcoin holders can transact without depending on a third party. Notably, this development coincides with a significant drop in BTC inventory on major exchanges like Coinbase and Binance, as well as at GBTC. The decline has accelerated since the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs, hinting at a potential departure from exchanges. Meanwhile, the operators of GBTC are unwinding the product and converting it to a spot Bitcoin ETF following a court decision. Will Spot BTC ETFs Gain Traction? Even so, that “old whales” are moving their coins to centralized products like ETFs contradicts the core philosophy of BTC as a tool for financial self-sovereignty. Whether more users, mainly retailers, will choose to own spot Bitcoin ETF shares rather than the underlying coins directly remains to be seen. Related Reading: Fantom: Market Slowdown Chops Off 10% From Gains – Here’s Why Institutions might be obliged by law to use a regulated product if they need to be exposed to BTC. However, retailers can choose to buy directly from exchanges or mine. This freedom might lead to more retailers opting to buy BTC. This trend emerges ahead of the highly anticipated Bitcoin halving. This event is set for mid-April 2024 and will further reduce BTC’s circulating supply, potentially driving higher prices. Before then, BTC prices are firm, steady above $70,000 at the time of writing.

Crypto indices and funds are being created to track and provide tools and vehicles that expose investors to a broader cryptocurrency offering beyond just bitcoin. Jason Leibowitz from Hashnote provides an overview of evolving products in this market. Kim Greenberg from CoinDesk Indices answers questions in Ask an Expert.  Links to SWIFT, BlackRock and the London Stock Exchange announcements about their plans are below in Keep Reading.  Happy reading.  –S.M.  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  Beyond Bitcoin: Navigating the Cryptocurrency Landscape  Bitcoin, having recently commemorated its 15th anniversary, symbolizes a significant milestone in the evolution of the cryptocurrency asset class. While bitcoin laid the foundation for this market, the narrative has since expanded to include thousands of diverse tokens collectively valued in trillions of dollars. This growth underscores the dynamic evolution of the cryptocurrency ecosystem beyond bitcoin's pioneering role.  As this asset class continues to burgeon, investors encounter a fundamental challenge: how to navigate the vast and varied landscape of cryptocurrencies effectively. While the allure of comprehensive exposure to the cryptocurrency market remains strong, achieving this goal presents hurdles around liquidity, wallet management, allocation weightings and ongoing portfolio maintenance through market cycles.  The need to measure, invest and trade in the digital asset ecosystem extending beyond bitcoin is underscored by several factors:  Diversification: While bitcoin remains the cryptocurrency pioneer, the market now boasts thousands of alternative digital assets. Investors seek exposure to a broader spectrum of cryptocurrencies, recognizing the importance of diversification in managing risk. With the recent introduction of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the US markets, investors are now looking for more diverse investments to add to their portfolios, including spot Ether (ETH), liquid-staked crypto assets like stETH, and other innovative crypto indexes.  Evaluating Market Trends: The performance of the cryptocurrency market transcends bitcoin's fluctuations. Alternative cryptocurrencies exhibit diverse price movements, trends, and adoption rates. By tracking a comprehensive index, investors gain insights into overall market performance independent of bitcoin's influence. Investors are now keen on identifying the next big crypto trend beyond bitcoin's dominance, making broad-based crypto indexes essential tools for market analysis and investment decision-making.  Assessing Investment Opportunities: With the growing popularity of staked crypto assets like stETH, investors are exploring new avenues for investment diversification, seeking opportunities beyond traditional cryptocurrencies. Broad-based benchmarks enable investors to evaluate sector-specific performance and identify promising investment opportunities within these niches.  Technological Innovation: Rapid technological innovation characterizes the cryptocurrency landscape. Beyond Bitcoin, projects like Ethereum, Cardano and Solana pioneer groundbreaking solutions. Monitoring a comprehensive index facilitates awareness of emerging technologies and their adoption rates. As investors seek exposure to innovative projects and emerging technologies in the crypto space, indexes provide a curated selection of assets that reflect the evolving landscape of digital assets.  Market Sentiment and Confidence: The performance of multiple cryptocurrencies reflects broader market sentiment and confidence in the crypto ecosystem. Fluctuations in index composition or performance signal shifts in investor sentiment, regulatory developments, or macroeconomic factors impacting the market. With increasing market maturity and regulatory clarity, investors are gaining confidence in the cryptocurrency market, driving demand for diversified investment options.  The solution?  Several firms are forming broad-based digital asset benchmarks. Just like equities have the S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100, we are now seeing the emergence of the CoinDesk 20 and others. These indices are designed with trading and liquidity in mind.  Ultimately, investments beyond bitcoin offer a holistic view of the cryptocurrency market. By providing investors with regulated access to a diversified portfolio of digital assets, investors can be empowered to navigate the evolving crypto landscape confidently, assess investment opportunities, and glean insights into broader market trends and sentiment. This approach streamlines the investment processes, offering investors a simplified avenue for exposure to a diversified and balanced portfolio of cryptocurrencies.  - Jason Leibowitz MD, head of private wealth, Hashnote  Ask an Expert  How should I measure the ever-changing crypto landscape?  As the new digital asset class emerges, market participants and observers will need a new reference index to measure performance, invest and trade. Similar to any asset class, benchmarks are used to capture the full market. Hence, broad-based indices will emerge as the reference for crypto and the new building block for investment products. Several broad-based digital asset indices already exist, including the Bitwise 10 Large Cap Crypto Index and the CoinDesk 20 Index.  Spot bitcoin ETFs have been approved. What’s next?  Now that bitcoin is more traditionally accessible, we are observing investors turning their attention to the following three emerging themes:  Broad digital asset benchmarks: Bitcoin's dominance hovers slightly over 50%. This means that if you use bitcoin to measure the market, you're not capturing half of it. Similar to other asset classes, investors are beginning to seek more diversified digital asset exposure through broad-based benchmarks to capture the wider crypto market.  Bitcoin 2.0: Like other asset classes, there is a spectrum from beta to alpha-seeking strategies. Spot bitcoin ETFs are the beta. We are starting to see smart beta ETFs emerge, as we saw with the Global X ETF launch last week, as well as alpha-seeking strategies.  Ethereum: The Ethereum network has several use cases. Ethereum's evolution from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake with “The Merge” established a native interest rate for staking ether (ETH). In traditional finance, interest rates underpin the largest markets in the world and serve as a fundamental pillar of economic activity. Staking rates can do the same for the crypto industry. CESR, the composite ether staking rate, is a standardized benchmark rate for staking. As we’re seeing interest in spot ether ETFs, I believe we’ll also see more about ether staking rates and total return solutions that capture ETH + staking.  - Kim Greenberg, head of marketing, CoinDesk Indices  Keep Reading  BlackRock’s next move into digital assets came with announcing its first tokenized fund built on Ethereum.

24912302,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=600131,1711638030,The Bulls Are Back: Spot Bitcoin Inflows Surge With New Records,"Bitcoin bulls look to be firmly back in the driver’s seat following weeks of seeing BTC suffer a bearish sentiment with its price dips. The current bullish outlook for the flagship crypto is evident in the fact that the Spot Bitcoin ETFs are again recording an impressive amount of inflows. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Record $243 Million In Inflows Farside Investors revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $243 million in inflows on March 27. This record was primarily thanks to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the ARK 21Shares’ Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), which saw individual inflows of $323.8 million and $200.7 million, respectively. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Cardano Price Is Struggling Below $0.7 These inflows were enough to overshadow the $299.8 million that Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF GBTC recorded on the day. Meanwhile, this marks the third consecutive day that these Spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded net inflows, having seen net outflows throughout last week. These funds recorded an inflow of $418 million and $15.4 million on March 26 and 25, respectively. This is undoubtedly a welcome development for the crypto community, considering that analysts at JPMorgan already predicted that the wave of profit-taking from the BTC ETFs could last until Halving. Therefore, seeing sustained inflows into these ETFs could mean that the sentiment among these ETF investors has changed. Irrespective of the current outlook for these ETFs, there is reason to be confident about their future trajectory and how much funds could still flow into the Bitcoin ecosystem. Matt Hougan, the Chief Investment Officer (CIO) at Bitwise, recently suggested that the demand for these Bitcoin ETFs is far from its peak. That means that these funds could still witness an astonishing amount of inflows. BTC Still Primed For More Upside Move Before Halving The current bullish sentiment towards BTC suggests that the flagship crypto move could see further moves to the upside before the Halving event in mid-April. Besides the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which are back to recording net inflows, other fundamentals hint at a price surge for BTC soon enough. Related Reading: XRP Price Enters Pre-Bull Rally Phase: Crypto Analyst Reveals Next Target NewsBTC recently reported that the supply of BTC on centralized exchanges (CEX) has been declining lately, which means that the sell pressure for the crypto token has reduced significantly. With Bitcoin whales cooling off on selling, that leaves room for BTC to embark on an upward trend. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at around $70,300, up in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The stock’s relative attractiveness doesn't justify paying more than double for the same coin, Kerrisdale said.  MicroStrategy is no longer a unique way to gain access to bitcoin, it said.  MicroStrategy's (MSTR) shares fell as much as 14% on Thursday after a prominent short seller, Kerrisdale Capital, said in a report that it is short-selling the stock while betting long on bitcoin {{BTC}}.  “Shares of MicroStrategy have soared amid a recent rise in the price of bitcoin, but as is often the case with crypto, things have gotten carried away,” the short seller wrote.  None of the reasons cited for the stock’s relative attractiveness “justify paying well over double for the same coin,” the report said.  Software developer MicroStrategy’s business model is based on the acquisition and holding of bitcoin, and its crypto stash represents the majority of the company’s valuation. The company now holds about 214,246 bitcoins, which is more than 1% of all the 21 million tokens that will ever exist.  MicroStrategy's market cap is about $28 billion. Its bitcoin holdings are worth about $15.2 billion.  The report notes that the bitcoin price currently implied by MicroStrategy’s share price is $177,000, which is two and a half times the spot price of the cryptocurrency.  “The days when MicroStrategy shares represented a rare, unique way to gain access to bitcoin are long over,” the note said, adding that “bitcoin is now easily obtainable through brokerages, crypto exchanges and more recently low fee exchange-traded products (ETPs) and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).”  MicroStrategy didn’t respond to a request for comment before publication.  Kerrisdale isn't the only investor selling shares of MicroStrategy short. Total short interest in crypto stocks is $10.7 billion, with MicroStrategy and Coinbase (COIN) making up 84% of the bearish bets, according to a report from S3 Partners.

Dogecoin Beats Market With 17% Rally In The Last Day Most of the top cryptocurrencies have seen flat returns in the last 24 hours, but Dogecoin has gone its own way as the original meme coin has enjoyed a strong rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin “Liquid Inventory Ratio” Hits All-Time Low, What It Means The below chart shows what the asset’s performance has looked like during the last few days: The price of the coin appears to have sharply soared over the past day | Source: DOGEUSD on TradingView In this latest rally, Dogecoin has surged more than 17% in the last 24 hours and has cleared the $0.21 level. Among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap, only Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has registered comparable profits in the same period. DOGE still beats BCH in the 1-week timeframe, however, as the memecoin has managed returns of more than 40% in this period, while the Bitcoin hard-fork has seen 33%. The reason behind these two assets in particular seeing a strong performance may lie in the fact that Coinbase plans to add futures products for them starting the 1st of April. Litecoin (LTC) is also set to see a listing on the same day, but its performance has been much weaker than the other two. In terms of market cap, Dogecoin is currently the eighth-largest coin in the sector, as the table below shows: Looks like the market cap of the memecoin is just under $31 billion at the moment | Source: CoinMarketCap From the table, it’s apparent that the gap to USD Coin (USDC) in seventh isn’t too much right now, so if Dogecoin can keep up its surge, it’s possible that it may be able to flip the stablecoin. DOGE Transaction Volume Has Observed A Sharp Increase Recently Something that would confirm that widespread speculation around Dogecoin is ripe for a rally currently would be its Transaction Volume. As a user on X pointed out using data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, DOGE’s Transaction Volume has shot up recently. The “Transaction Volume” keeps track of the total amount of tokens (in USD) for a given cryptocurrency that has observed some movement on the blockchain in the past 24 hours. When the value of this metric is high, it means that the users are transacting large amounts on the network right now. Such a trend implies the trading interest around the asset is high currently. On the other hand, low values of the indicator can be a sign that the general interest in the cryptocurrency, both as an asset and a network, is low at the moment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Returns To Neutral: Buying Push Already Over? Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Dogecoin Transaction Volume over the past year: The metric seems to have gone up in recent days | Source: @trader_kamikaze on X As is visible in the chart, the Dogecoin Transaction Volume has experienced quite a boost recently, and what has accompanied this rise has been the latest rally. A rising volume can often be a positive sign for the sustainability of any rally, as it means that interest in the asset is going up, and thus, more fuel is potentially coming in. Something to keep in mind, though, is that selling and buying alike affect this indicator, so a mass selloff would also register as a spike in the metric. Thus, while high volumes are usually a requirement for rallies to continue (as without interest, the run can easily die down), they alone can’t predict a further rise, as the nature of this activity can be hard to ascertain.

Several posts from prominent Dogecoin community members on X speculated about the token's implementation on the platform, especially in relation to a new payment branch being awarded more licenses in the U.S.  Dogecoin {{DOGE}} surged to its highest since December 2021 on Thursday amid bullish sentiment and speculation about the use of the dog-themed meme coin on the social-media platform X.  DOGE exchanged hands at 22 cents in European afternoon hours, a 17% gain over 24 hours. The broader market was little changed, with bitcoin {{BTC}} steady at around the $70,000 level and the broad-based majors index CoinDesk 20 showing no change.  The token tends to react to payments-related developments at any Elon Musk-owned company, such as X or Tesla, and several social-media posts from prominent Dogecoin community members speculated about the token’s usage on X, likely fueling trading interest.  “Dear #Dogecoin, with X's new payment branch being awarded more licenses in the U.S., many are speculating about the implementation of crypto payments in the platform,” Dogecoin developer @@mishaboar said in an X post Thursday. “Early this month, Elon said X is very close to landing a money transmitter license in California. Getting the license in NY will still take a few months,” he added.  CoinGecko data shows that trading volume for DOGE shot up to $7 billion in the past 24 hours from an average of $3 billion earlier in the week, even as broader crypto volumes remained lower amid little volatility.  Elsewhere, futures tracking the tokens saw open interest rise to nearly $2 billion across crypto exchanges from $1 billion on Monday, indicative of rising bets on price volatility.  Speculation about the token’s usage on X has been around since Musk bought the company in 2021, given his endorsement of the token. Musk’s electric car company, Tesla, has accepted DOGE payments for merchandise purchases in the Tesla Store since 2021.  X said in January it planned to launch a peer-to-peer payments service this year.

42391048,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69be9ffR,1711632600,Sam Bankman-Fried Sentenced to 25 Years in Prison,"FTX founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison Thursday for his conviction on seven different fraud and conspiracy charges.  Bankman-Fried was accused of running a massive fraud in FTX and Alameda, which collapsed dramatically in 2022, losing customers some $8 to $11 billion.  NEW YORK — Sam Bankman-Fried must spend 25 years in prison for the fraud and conspiracy scheme that ultimately undid his once-giant cryptocurrency exchange FTX, a federal judge ruled on Thursday.  As he prepared to deliver the sentence, Judge Lewis Kaplan said Bankman-Fried never offered ""a word of remorse for commission of terrible crimes."" Kaplan said Bankman-Fried's attempt to craft a positive and altruistic persona in the public eye was, at least in part, ""an act."" He rejected the defense's argument that Bankman-Fried was not at risk of committing future crimes., ""Mr. Bankman-Fried's name is pretty much mud right now around the world,"" but he is ""persistent"" and ""a great marketing guy,"" said the judge while explaining why the FTX CEO deserved a lengthy sentence.  Kaplan judge announced his decision after a two-hour hearing in a Manhattan courtroom during which prosecutors, Bankman-Fried's attorney, a victim, a lawyer who spoke on behalf of other FTX victims and Bankman-Fried himself delivered comments. This followed Bankman-Fried's conviction on seven criminal counts in November, a year after FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The former FTX CEO will appeal his conviction, according to his lawyer Thursday, a process that couldn't begin until Kaplan's sentencing decision.  Bankman-Fried was also fined $11 billion, which includes forfeiture agreements to sell assets like a private jet.  ""Today's sentence will prevent the defendant from ever again committing fraud and is an important message to others who might be tempted to engage in financial crimes that justice will be swift, and the consequences will be severe,"" Damian Williams, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement on social media platform X. ""The scale of his crimes is measured not just by the amount of money that was stolen, but by the extraordinary harm caused to victims, who in some cases had their life savings wiped out overnight.""  “A beautiful puzzle”  Bankman-Fried’s attorney Mark Mukasey told Judge Kaplan that his client “doesn’t make decisions with malice in his heart – he makes them with math in his head,” adding “Anybody who really knows Sam, they’ll say he’s not a greedy, power hungry fiend…really, he’s an awkward math nerd.”  Mukasey repeatedly referenced Bankman-Fried’s autism and social awkwardness, and his commitment to altruism, calling him “a beautiful puzzle” with “a tireless work ethic and a completely, off the chart, mind-blowing intellect,” and asked the judge to not destroy the prime of his client’s life.  “Don’t deprive him of the opportunity to meet a partner and have a baby,” Mukasey told the court.  Bankman-Fried speaks  When it was his turn to speak, Bankman-Fried said he was more concerned with the FTX customers waiting for their money to be returned than his “emotional life” or “hypothetical future kids.”  ""My useful life is probably over. It's been over for a while now,"" said Bankman-Fried, who has spent the last six months in the notorious Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn.  As he walked into the courtroom on Thursday – his parents and a crowd of assorted onlookers watching on from the court's viewing gallery – Bankman-Fried was noticeably thinner than he had been during last year's trial. Bankman-Fried's signature curly mop of hair – which had been trimmed down for his October trial – looked fuller but more unkempt than it had previously.  Bankman-Fried, wearing a tan prison jumpsuit with short sleeves, spoke for several minutes as a U.S. Marshall stood directly behind him. Bankman-Fried repeated his long-standing claim that ""there were enough assets, there are enough assets"" for FTX's creditors to get paid back in full.  Bankman-Fried told the court that righting the ship after his company’s self-induced “liquidity crisis” – which he called “in part, my doing” – would have made for “an unpleasant few weeks,” but he insisted “FTX would have survived” even if Alameda, the trading shop he tried to rescue using FTX customer funds, was forced to shut down.  Even if creditors do receive their funds back now, they would be ""deprived of the gains"" seen by the broader crypto market over the past several months, he said, echoing a concern stated by FTX creditors in victim impact statements filed by the DOJ over the past few weeks.  Bankman-Fried extended compliments to three of his former friends – and key government witnesses – Nishad Singh, Gary Wang and Caroline Ellison, expressing regret for his lead role in FTX's collapse. “I’m sorry about what happened at every stage…at the end of the day, I failed everyone I cared about,” Bankman-Fried said, adding, ""I was responsible.""  Focus on customers  Bankman-Fried spoke after an FTX creditor and an attorney who represents a class action suit against the bankruptcy estate – both of whom used their time to claim that the FTX bankruptcy estate is mishandling customer funds. All three said the estate's proposed payouts to creditors are lower than they should be given current market prices.  Adam Moskowitz, the attorney who represents the class, offered a line of support for Bankman-Fried during his brief statement before the court, saying the former CEO – alongside other former FTX executives – had helped his team recover some of the funds FTX had lost.  ""Sam and his team have been helpful to us,"" he said. ""I would ask on behalf of the victims that you honorably and respectfully consider [that].""  Weighing a sentence  Bankman-Fried faced up to a century in prison, based on a report from a probation officer. Kaplan wasn't bound to this recommendation. Bankman-Fried's defense team – a different group of lawyers than the ones who represented him during the five-week trial – asked for no more than 6 1/2 years, while U.S. Department of Justice prosecutors sought 40 to 50 years behind bars.  During his reading of the sentence, the judge virtually eviscerated Bankman-Fried and his testimony during last year's trial.  Bankman-Fried posed ""enormous harm"" to creditors, had demonstrated ""exceptional flexibility with the truth"" during his testimony and showed an ""apparent lack of remorse.""  ""When he wasn't outright lying, he was evasive, hair-splitting [and] dodging questions,"" the judge said, adding that he was ""trying to get the prosecutor"" to rephrase questions.  Despite his apparent frustration with Bankman-Fried, Kaplan ultimately decided that 50 years in prison – let alone 100 – was ""substantially greater than is necessary"" and recommended that he serve out his sentence in a medium or low-security federal prison. He additionally recommended that the prison be as close to the San Francisco Bay Area, where Bankman-Fried is from, as possible, to facilitate family visitation.  Kaplan said that his recommendation was based on Bankman-Fried’s lack of violent history and the fact that his notoriety, autism diagnosis, and association with wealth would make him extra vulnerable in a maximum security prison.  Bankman-Fried will need to serve a minimum of 85% of his sentence, a requirement established by the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, which allows for a maximum of 15% of a federal sentence allowed to be shaved off for good behavior. This is of course, dependent on what his appeal looks like and whether it is successful. His team has 14 days to file an appeal from the day the sentence is entered into the record, which Judge Kaplan said may happen as soon as later Thursday.  Before the day began  The DOJ said Bankman-Fried deserved a severe penalty, citing the fact that FTX, which was once valued at $32 billion, lost essentially all its money due to his malfeasance. During the trial, prosecutors said Bankman-Fried stole $8 billion of customer money to fund venture-capital investments, real-estate purchases, political donations and more. Prosecutors submitted dozens of victim impact statements from former FTX customers as evidence, saying the sheer scale of the fraud Bankman-Fried was convicted on supported a harsher penalty – though one that was half what he technically could face.  Defense lawyers argued, on the other hand, that Bankman-Fried didn't intend to defraud customers, had shown remorse and had attempted to resolve FTX's bankruptcy after it began, saying the DOJ's proposal was extreme. Their supporting letters spoke more to Bankman-Fried as a person than to FTX and its collapse, with writers pointing to his veganism and anecdotes from his youth. Several letters said Bankman-Fried appeared to be neurodivergent and thus might not have understood the severity of the situation. Former New York Police Department officer Carmine Simpson, his fellow inmate in a Brooklyn detention facility who pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor, wrote a letter saying Bankman-Fried, a vegan, has been forced to eat poorly in jail.

42391051,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69be9fkZ,1711630637,"Ethereum's Rising Validator Count Is Causing Concerns, Fidelity Digital Assets Says","Ethereum’s active validator set has risen by 74%, Fidelity Digital Assets wrote.  Too many validators is causing concerns about bandwidth risks and centralization.  More validators is normally viewed as a good problem as it represents increased adoption, but it is impossible to accurately predict future staking demand, the report said.  The rapidly rising validator count on the Ethereum blockchain following the Shapella upgrade in April last year is causing concerns about technical capacity and centralization, Fidelity Digital Assets wrote in a research report on Thursday.  Fidelity noted that “with the lowered risk from increased liquidity, the active validator count has risen by 74%,” and said “future roadmap upgrades will become more difficult” with this larger set.  The Shapella upgrade enabled withdrawals, for the first time, for validators who staked their ether {{ETH}} to secure and validate transactions on the blockchain.  A large validator count is a concern because “bandwidth and latency are critical in a large validator set network, where each validator must independently download the latest data and verify state change proposals within a small time frame,” analyst Daniel Gray wrote, adding that “the larger the block (data), the more computing power needed to process and re-execute the transactions before the next slot.”  Every new validator adds a further connection to the network which increases the overall bandwidth that is needed to maintain consensus, the note said.  “The potential concern is that as the bandwidth requirements grow, the validators that are unable to keep pace will drop from the network - those that drop are more likely to be the self-hosted nodes,” Gray wrote. “If the average household struggles to keep up with the network, there is a risk of increased centralization over time, as the only hardware to survive may live within institution-owned data centers,” he added.  While the growth in the size of the validator set has slowed recently, it's unclear what the situation may be in a year from now, the report said; “therefore, the possibility of rapid growth could be a problem due to centralization and bandwidth risks.”  The challenge of an expanding validator count has always been viewed as a “good problem” as it represents increased adoption and security for the Ethereum blockchain. Still “it is impossible to accurately predict the staking demand in the future,” the report added.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  The market for tokenized U.S. Treasury debt is booming. The market value of Treasury notes tokenized through public blockchains like Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Stellar and others has crossed above $1 billion for the first time, data tracked by Tom Wan, an analyst at crypto firm 21.co, show. Tokenized Treasuries are digital representations of U.S. government bonds that can be traded as tokens on the blockchain. The market value has risen nearly 10-fold since January last year and 18% since traditional finance giant BlackRock announced Etheruem-based tokenized fund BUIDL on March 20.  Bitcoin (BTC) prices were little changed over the past 24 hours after a volatile week. Prices briefly jumped above $71,000 on Tuesday, and have since retreated slightly to levels around $70,700 ahead of a major options expiry on Friday. Most major tokens posted slight losses. Meanwhile, bitcoin cash (BCH) zoomed 13% before an expected halving event on April 4. The current block reward of 6.25 BCH will be cut to 3.125 BCH. Open interest on BCH-tracked futures more than doubled to $500 million on Thursday from $213 million last week, showing an increase in levered bets on more expected price volatility.  BlackRock's first tokenized asset fund is off to a strong start, garnering a significant market share of the blockchain-based tokenized U.S. Treasury market just a week after its debut. Blockchain data shows that BlackRock's BUIDL raked in $245 million of deposits as of Wednesday. Its strong introduction propelled the fund into second place among peers, trailing only Franklin Templeton's Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX), which has $360 million of deposits, according to rwa.xyz data.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows shares in Nvidia (NVDA) are on track to register the first weekly loss of 2024.  Since 2020, Bitcoin has closely tracked Nvidia prices. The 90-day and 52-week correlation coefficients between the two are greater than 0.80.

Related Reading: From $90 To $400 Litecoin: Analysts Bullish On LTC Soaring Trajectory Fantom is one of those altcoins that followed the broader momentum of the market. The latest market data shows that the token is down 10% in the past 24 hours, but is still on the green in the bi-weekly timeframe at 14%. However, Fantom has a trick up its sleeve to curb this brewing bearishness potentially. Fantom CEO Michael Kong Unveils Sonic Launch Sonic is the brand-new technology that the Fantom has been developing in the past 2 years. According to their latest blog post, Sonic was able to surpass the network’s 200 transactions per second metric. Although 200 TPS was already impressive compared to Ethereum’s 12 TPS, the network was quickly congested, and user experience deteriorated. Kong said in the blog post: “​​Sonic will be used to create a new best-in-class shared sequencer for L1 and L2 chains, capable of processing over 180 million daily transactions with real, sub-second confirmation times, and serve as the foundation to relaunch Fantom as an entirely new community-centric brand.” This brand-new tech will cover all parts of the Fantom network, from bridging to a stablecoin launch, Sonic has it all. Sonic Labs will also gain a slice of the pie as the foundation ultimately adds grant programs alongside the network upgrades. Bitcoin is now trading at $70.396. Chart: TradingView “We will continue to significantly scale and accelerate our Sonic Labs grant program for developers who build unique and valuable applications and public goods in categories including gaming, DeFi, social media, streaming, and now distributed AI,” Kong added. This will significantly increase the size of Fantom’s user base, boosting investor confidence, and giving more room for developers to innovate. Furthermore, the advancements brought forth by Sonic Labs in covering all aspects of the Fantom network, from bridging to the launch of a stablecoin, are poised to have a notable impact on Fantom’s market dynamics. By streamlining processes, enhancing interoperability, and introducing new functionalities, these developments are likely to enhance the network’s attractiveness to investors and users alike.

She has highlighted their potential to foster massive adoption and increase engagement within the cryptocurrency space. Why Meme Coins Are Crypto’s Trojan Horse For Adoption Speaking at BUIDL Asia, a global developer community in Seoul, South Korea, on Thursday, March 28, Bus gave a presentation on the emerging trends in crypto in 2024. The Messari crypto executive had primarily focused on the impact and potential benefits of meme coins in driving adoption within the crypto space. Related Reading: Fifth Largest Bitcoin Whale Moves $6 Billion In BTC, Here’s The Destination According to Bus, meme coins have become an integral part of the crypto market and are evolving towards potentially establishing themselves as a distinct asset class. The Messari executive has described these humor themed coins as a “Trojan horse” which could potentially facilitate the entry of new users into the realm of cryptocurrency, effectively boosting adoption. During her speech, Bus disclosed that the introduction of these coins has successfully attracted the attention of both crypto and non-crypto enthusiasts. This is seen in the cryptocurrency’s ability to capture the attention of investors, utilizing its meme-based marketing strategies to fuel engagement while also providing opportunities for massive profitability due to its speculative nature. Bus believes that meme coins could be likened to a long tail speculative service like lottery tickets which attract investors seeking high risk, high reward opportunities. Additionally, owing to their relatively low price value, they cater to individuals across various income brackets, who are willing to take speculative bets in the hopes of securing significant returns. Moreover, according to the Messari executive, meme coins serve as a gateway for newcomers to the Web3 space, exposing them to fundamental crypto concepts like decentralization. The Growing Allure In Crypto Space Lately, the rise in interest in meme coins has been growing at an exceptional rate, attracting both investors and traders from all over the world. This surge in interest has propelled meme coins in the spotlight, pushing their prices to unprecedented highs. Related Reading: The Road To $100,000: Bitcoin Whale Accumulation Explodes Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, which are backed by underlying projects and practical use cases, meme coins derive their value largely from their community and speculative appeal. Additionally, these cryptocurrencies offer a more approachable entry point into the realm of crypto investments, utilizing their affordability and susceptibility to social media trends and user sentiments to attract seasoned investors and newcomers alike.

The tally has risen nearly 10-fold since January 2023 amid elevated interest rates worldwide.  The market for tokenized U.S. Treasury debt is booming.  The market value of Treasury notes tokenized through public blockchains like Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Stellar and others has crossed above $1 billion for the first time, data tracked by Tom Wan, an analyst at crypto firm 21.co, show.  Tokenized Treasuries are digital representations of U.S. government bonds that can be traded as tokens on the blockchain. The market value has risen nearly 10-fold since January last year and 18% since traditional finance giant BlackRock announced Etheruem-based tokenized fund BUIDL on March 20.  As of writing, BUILD is the second-largest such fund, with a tokenized value of $245 million, trailing only Franklin Templeton's Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX) – one share of which is represented by the BENJI token – which led the pack with $360.2 million in deposits.

42391042,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69be9fKv,1711620000,Recapping FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried's Trial,"Thousands of people’s financial stability was taken 15 months ago when FTX founder and then CEO Sam Bankman-Fried’s lies were exposed and the former crypto exchange fell apart.  Today, Bankman-Fried could be sentenced to up to 50 years in prison, which at his current age of 32 years, is nearly life-long.  For five weeks late last year, the former poster child fought for his freedom in a trial in which even his closest friends and confidants, including his onetime girlfriend Caroline Ellison, turned against him and came clean about the massive scheme that took place behind the scenes at FTX.  You're reading The SBF Trial, a CoinDesk newsletter bringing you daily insights from inside the courtroom where Sam Bankman-Fried will try to stay out of prison. Want to receive it directly? Sign up here.  Ellison, who took the stand for three consecutive days, detailed how her former boss ordered her to create seven different balance sheets to send to lenders at the time – all of them factually wrong as FTX wasn’t in a position to repay its loans.  Most importantly, she confirmed, through text messages and internal documents, how Bankman-Fried repeatedly made the conscious decision to take customer’s money and fund Alameda Research’s, the then trading arm of FTX, investments.  FTX and Alameda's collapse wasn't the accidental result of a poorly managed firm, as Bankman-Fried claimed it to be in his defense. It was a well-thought out plan that required several active decisions by the former CEO, knowing that they were criminal, a jury found last year.  In November, Bankman-Fried's jury convicted him on seven different charges: committing and conspiring to commit wire fraud on FTX customers; committing and conspiring to commit wire fraud on Alameda Research's lenders; conspiring to commit securities and commodities fraud against FTX's customers and conspiring to commit money laundering to hide the proceeds of wire fraud on FTX's customers.  Ellison, although by far the most anticipated and important witness in the trial, wasn’t the only person in Bankman-Fried’s close circle that turned on him.  Co-founder of FTX and chief technology officer Gary Wang and former engineering head Nishad Singh were two other key witnesses who took the stand for several days to talk about their involvement in the scheme.  Wang said that special privileges were given to Alameda Research which were written directly into the code. Singh confirmed that statement, and gave more details about how exactly money was moved, the code worked and other things, including Bankman-Fried’s lavish spending.  Despite all of that, Bankman-Fried seemed to remain hopeful throughout the trial and eventually took the stand himself. However, it quickly became clear that he wasn’t ready to answer fully. Instead, oftentimes he claimed he wouldn’t remember certain things he didn’t seem to want to answer. Prosecutors also pointed out several times that his statements were contradicting things that he had said before. Needless to say, it didn’t go well.  On November 3, Bankman-Fried was found guilty on all seven counts of fraud and conspiracy.  Last month, the defense urged Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, who oversees the case, to consider a sentence of six years, arguing that FTX creditors are likely to get the majority of their funds back.  Prosecutors called the proposal “woefully inadequate” and recommended that Bankman-Fried be sentenced to 40-50 years in prison, but the decision is ultimately up to Judge Kaplan.  Bankman-Fried’s sentencing starts at 9:30 a.m. Eastern time today.  — Helene Braun  What we're expecting  Sam Bankman-Fried's sentencing hearing kicks off in a few short hours.

Over the past week, LTC has seen a 13% increase, with its value hovering nearly $96 at the time of writing. This bullish run has been accompanied by technical indicators suggesting a potential continuation of the uptrend, but some analysts warn of lurking risks. LTC maintains a strong weekly performance.

Additionally, a rise in Daily Active Addresses and transaction volume indicates increased investor activity and trading. This is further corroborated by a bullish crossover on the MACD indicator and a rising Money Flow Index (MFI), both suggesting potential for further price hikes. Bitcoin is now trading at $70.714. Chart: TradingView However, not all signals are green. The Network-to-Value (NVT) ratio, which indicates potential overvaluation, has also spiked alongside the price increase. This raises concerns about a possible price correction if the market deems LTC to be overvalued. While the recent price action for Litecoin is encouraging, it’s crucial to maintain a balanced perspective, analysts caution. Technical indicators can be helpful, but they shouldn’t be the sole decision-making factors, they said. LTC Hashrate Remains Stable Meanwhile, the hashrate, a measure of computing power dedicated to mining LTC, has remained stable, suggesting no significant changes in miner activity. However, some analysts worry that a potential drop in hashrate could hinder future growth.

Spot ETFs could become a more meaningful contributor to bitcoin’s price action.  BTC miners show signs of decoupling from the cryptocurrency's price as the halving event raises questions about profitability, Canaccord wrote.  The more than 60% rally in bitcoin {{BTC}} in the first quarter was driven mainly by the approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the impending reward halving and an appetite for increased risk in financial markets, broker Canaccord Genuity said in a research report on Thursday.  “While the macro outlook and timing of potential rate cuts remain uncertain, the upcoming halving event could add to the ETF tailwinds for bitcoin,” analysts led by Michael Graham wrote, adding that “for the rest of the ecosystem, activity levels continue to rebound from 2023 lows.” The quadrennial halving is when miner rewards are slashed by 50%, thereby reducing the supply of bitcoin. The next halving is expected in April. Canaccord says it is encouraged by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of 11 U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs in the quarter. “While bitcoin’s increase in value during Q1 was far greater than ETF inflows, this tailwind should persist as retail investors look to add crypto exposure to IRAs and other tax-advantaged accounts, and we expect spot ETFs could become a more meaningful part of bitcoin’s price action going forward,” the authors wrote. IRAs are a way of saving for retirement in the U.S.  Publicly traded miners underperformed bitcoin in the first quarter, showing signs of decoupling from the cryptocurrency's price, the report noted. Canaccord said next month's halving has introduced uncertainty about the profitability of some miners, and spot ETFs have given equity investors an alternative means of gaining exposure to the world’s largest cryptocurrency. “If history were to repeat itself, an even more bullish period for bitcoin and crypto could potentially be on the horizon in the months following this halving event,” the report added.

42391058,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69be9gKT,1711617880,Fewer Than 30% of Jurisdictions Globally Have Started Regulating Crypto: FATF Chief,"A lack of regulation ""creates significant loopholes for both criminals and terrorists to exploit"" and is ""a call to action that we need countries to take this problem seriously,"" Financial Action Task Force President T. Raja Kumar said in an interview with CoinDesk.  FATF published a new report evaluating jurisdictions on their crypto regulation after a 12-month process involving FATF's 39 members and 20 jurisdictions that aren't members.  Fewer than 30% of jurisdictions around the globe had started regulating the crypto sector as of June 2023, Financial Action Task Force (FATF) President T. Raja Kumar told CoinDesk in an interview from Singapore.  That low level of attention warrants ""call to action,"" said Raja Kumar. The statistic was detailed in a progress report made public on Thursday and shared with CoinDesk, which explored how dozens of jurisdictions have adhered to the FATF's recommendations.  The report is titled ""Status of Implementation of Recommendation 15 by FATF Members and Jurisdictions with Materially Important VASP Activity."" The recommendation had suggested that jurisdictions should move to get a better handle on money-laundering and terrorist-financing risks posed by crypto, and they should license or register virtual asset service providers (VASPs) and conduct reviews of their business practices, products and technology.  The FATF recommendations are not mandatory, but non-abiding jurisdictions could face global isolation through drops in their credibility ratings and other actions, such as the repercussions of being put on the FATF's watchlist.  The crypto sector has faced a credibility and safety crisis as it's been beset by hacks, many of which are linked to North Korea, sanctions from the U.S. and the U.N., and allegations of being a conduit for terrorist financing, including for those aiding Hamas and ISIS.  FATF's 'call to action'  The boss of the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog said it was ""the first such report"" addressing the concern that a lack of regulation ""creates significant loopholes for both criminals and terrorists to exploit"" and is ""a call to action that we need countries to take this problem seriously.""  ""I would describe virtual assets as being akin to water, and essentially they will flow to jurisdictions that are less regulated,"" Raja Kumar said. ""Criminals and terrorists are very quick to spot the opportunity leading to regulatory arbitrage. We just can't allow this. Every part of the global chain needs to be strong. This is not a trivial matter.""  Purpose of report  The FATF chief said the report is meant to bring global attention to the issue as a ""constructive"" effort to inform regulators and the private sector about what's going on with the group's standards.  ""Virtual assets are inherently international and borderless, meaning a failure to regulate VASPs in one jurisdiction can have serious global implications,"" the report said.  In one example, the report referred to ""the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s (DPRK) theft and laundering of hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of virtual assets,"" which have been said to be used for ""weapons of mass destruction.""  It also noted the increasing use of cryptocurrencies to raise and move funds for terrorist groups. The report contended that bad actors were 'almost exclusively' demanding ransomware payments in cryptocurrencies.  Compliance levels of jurisdictions  The FATF has been urging jurisdictions to fully implement its recommendations for some time now. The table in the report rates each jurisdiction as compliant, largely compliant, partially compliant, or non-compliant.  The criteria include enacting legislation or regulation requiring the licensing or registration of VASPs, having registered or licensed such businesses, conducting supervisory inspections, taking enforcement actions against VASPs or enacting the travel rule for them.  FATF's controversial ""travel rule"" requires crypto service providers to collect and share information on transactions above a certain threshold.  In several cases such as India, Singapore, Spain, Portugal, Italy and Malaysia, their assessments around compliance with Recommendation 15 are ongoing so the table rated them as N/A (not applicable). Other nations, such as Argentina, had conducted a risk assessment covering VASPs but had not completed any of the other seven relevant criteria.  North Korea is blacklisted by the FATF, while Russia's membership was suspended in Feb. 2023.  Raja Kumar said the FATF isn't demanding jurisdictions implement their recommendations by passing laws but that notifications from the government could be enough.  Methodology  At a FATF plenary held in February 2024, the group agreed to publish an overview of the steps jurisdictions have taken to regulate VASPs, resulting in this analysis. The 12-month examination took a look at the FATF's 39 members and 20 other jurisdictions who host materially important crypto-related activities.  The selection of ""materially important"" jurisdictions was based on jurisdictions that hosted VASPs with more than 0.25% of global virtual asset trading volume or that had at least one million virtual asset users.  Collectively, those jurisdictions accounted for 97% of global crypto activity.

Crypto firms will have to pass an evaluation in a sandbox environment by the new regulator before they are granted approval to operate in the country.

Firms that offer services in the country without being evaluated in the sandbox will be considered to be operating illegally.

This week’s market activities have shown a remarkable reversal from the previous 5-day net outflow streak, with Tuesday witnessing a substantial net inflow of $480 million, followed by $243.5 million on Wednesday.

Hougan’s commentary, part of his weekly memo to investment professionals, sheds light on the current market dynamics and the colossal potential that lies ahead. “1% Down; 99% to Go,” Hougan wrote, highlighting the nascent yet promising journey of Bitcoin ETFs. Related Reading: $9.5 Billion In Bitcoin Options Poised To Expire This Friday: Market Turbulence Ahead? Lately, the market has been characterized by its volatility, with Bitcoin’s price oscillating between $60,000 and $70,000. Hougan advises a calm and long-term perspective amidst this fluctuation, especially as the sector anticipates the upcoming Bitcoin halving around April 20, the approval of Bitcoin ETFs on national account platforms, and the soon-to-come completion of due diligence by various investment committees. Despite the current sideways movement of Bitcoin’s price, Hougan remains bullish about its long-term trajectory. “Bitcoin is in a raging bull market,” he asserts, noting a nearly 300% increase over the past 15 months. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January has marked a significant milestone, opening up the Bitcoin market to investment professionals on an unprecedented scale. Hougan’s analysis points to a profound shift as global wealth managers, who collectively control over $100 trillion, begin to explore investments in the “digital gold.” He suggests that even a conservative allocation of 1% of their portfolios to Bitcoin could result in approximately $1 trillion of inflows into the space. Related Reading: Bitcoin “Liquid Inventory Ratio” Hits All-Time Low, What It Means This perspective is backed by historical data showing that even a 2.5% allocation to Bitcoin has enhanced the risk-adjusted returns of traditional 60/40 portfolios in every three-year period of Bitcoin’s history. The recent inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, though impressive, are seen by Hougan as merely the beginning of a much larger movement. “We are all excited about the $12 billion that has flowed into ETFs since January. And it is exciting: Collectively, the most successful ETF launch of all time..But imagine global wealth managers allocate just 1% of their portfolios to bitcoin on average,” Hougan elaborates, emphasizing the scale of potential growth awaiting the cryptocurrency market. He concludes: Think about the implications. A 1% allocation across the board would mean ~$1 trillion of inflows into the space. Against this, $12 billion is barely a down payment. 1% down, 99% to go.

This tool is relatively novel, and Patryn has contested the claim, with his counsel calling it unconstitutional  The Canadian Province of British Columbia is seeking to use an unexplained wealth order, a new type of court order that compels a person to explain how they acquired their assets, to target the co-founder of QuadrigaCX, Michael Patryn.  “Today, we have filed our third unexplained wealth order application with the British Columbia Supreme Court,” Mike Farnworth, the Province’s Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, said in a statement. “The international, criminal actions of QuadrigaCX led to thousands of people losing their life savings.”  The order was used to seize a safety deposit box at CIBC Bank as well as an account. The safety deposit box contained C$250,200 ($184,250) in cash, gold bars, two Rolex watches, a Chanel J12 Black Diamond watch, and other jewelry. A 45-caliber Ruger 1911 pistol with ammunition was also found in the box, as well as identity documents under the names of Omar Dhanani and Omar Patryn, the Order says.  The Order argues that Patryn was heavily involved in all aspects of QuadrigaCX’s operation, including missapropriating customer funds and cryptocurrency, justifying the seizure of goods. After the seizure, the next step is to compel a response from Patryn to explain his wealth. He filed a response to the order, arguing that the goods seized were not acquired by unlawful means.  “The investigation was conducted in such a manner that, and evidence was obtained during the investigation in such a manner that breached the Defendants’ rights as guaranteed by the Charter (Canada’s constitution),” Patryn’s counsel wrote.  Other targets of B.C.'s unexplained wealth orders have also argued in court that they are unconstitutional given the reverse onus of having to explain the source of wealth.  Post the collapse of QuadrigaCX, Patryn has had a second career in decentralized finance (DeFi), being involved in a number of protocols, including Wonderland and another called UwU Lend, under the handle ""Sifu.” It is believed that Patryn resides in Thailand.  Patryn was ousted from his role in Wonderland after community members doxxed him, then ran a public vote to oust him from his role as treasurer, securing 87.56% votes.  Prosecutors will appear in court on April 30 to make the application.

Dogecoin jumped 6%, while Bitcoin Cash saw a 13% rise ahead of an expected halving event on April 4, which historically has preceded a bull market for the token.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} prices were little changed over the past 24 hours amid few catalysts after a volatile week. Prices briefly jumped above $71,000 on Tuesday, but have since retreated and remain steady around $70,000 level ahead of a major options expiry on Friday.  Most major tokens posted slight losses. CoinGecko data shows that Solana’s SOL, XRP, and BNB Chain’s BNB dropped as much as 2%, while Internet Computer’s ICP fell 6%.  Some traders warned of a further market-wide pullback if bitcoin were to lose the $69,000 level in the coming days.  “Bitcoin has fallen back below $70K, which can be attributed to the bulls’ need to let off steam and the general decline in risk appetite in global markets,” said FxPro senior market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich in an email.  “The short-term focus for traders will be to see if bitcoin can retest Tuesday’s intra-day lows near $69.5K. A break below this level could signal a more protracted correction,” he added.  Dogecoin {{DOGE}} posted the most gains among majors with a 6% bump. Historic price action suggests the token is showing similar fractals that have preceded significant rallies. The increase took the token over 21 cents for the first time since December 2021.  The CoinDesk 20, a broad-based liquid index of top tokens minus stablecoins, was down 1.4%.  Meanwhile, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) zoomed 13% ahead of an expected halving event on April 4. The current block reward is 6.25 BCH, but after the next halving, it will be 3.125 BCH.  Open interest on BCH-tracked futures more than doubled to $500 million on Thursday from $213 million last week, showing an increase in levered bets on more expected price volatility.  Halving occurs when the reward for mining transactions is cut in half, reducing the rate at which new coins are created and thus lowering the available amount of new supply.

Steingraber, a seasoned game designer, laid out his thoughts in a recent post, igniting discussions about the potential trajectory of an XRP ETF, particularly in light of the ongoing push for institutional adoption of the altcoin. Related Reading: Hold Onto Your Seats: XRP Primed For 90% Rally, According To Top Analyst Targeting A $500 XRP ETF Share Price Steingraber’s speculation centers around the price at which an XRP ETF’s shares might trade. His hypothesis hinges on the crypto reaching an unprecedented price of $5 per coin. In this scenario, he theorizes that the corresponding ETF could soar to equally unprecedented heights, potentially reaching a solid $500 per share. The actual underlying asset price does NOT have to skyrocket. The fund can trade at MASSIVE Premiums. Let’s say #XRP breaks ATH @ $5, its ETF fund could literally trade at 100x premium if the institutional demand kicks in. Yes, that’s right, a $500 #XRP Institution Premium. 👍 https://t.co/bwN6cGmmZd pic.twitter.com/tHyy4fkbeK — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) March 27, 2024 This hefty premium, according to Steingraber, would be fueled by a surge in institutional interest in the ETF. He cites the Grayscale Litecoin Trust (LTCN) as a prime example. Similar to his proposed XRP ETF, LTCN trades at a significant premium over Litecoin’s current market price. Despite Litecoin hovering around $95, investors in LTCN are currently paying a premium of over $250 per Litecoin equivalent within the trust. Can Arbitrage Opportunities Emerge? The prospect of such a high premium has sparked discussions about potential arbitrage opportunities. X user Zack, in response to Steingraber’s post, questioned whether individuals holding XRP could exploit this price disparity. Steingraber acknowledged the possibility, particularly if the issuing ETF allows for in-kind deposits, where investors can directly exchange their token for ETF shares. XRP market cap currently at $34 billion. Chart: TradingView.com However, he cautioned that in-kind deposits are still a rarity in the ETF market. While Steingraber expressed optimism about the future adoption of this practice, its absence presents a hurdle for immediate arbitrage opportunities. The XRP community has long advocated for asset managers, especially industry giant BlackRock, to launch an XRP ETF. They believe such a product would significantly bolster the value of XRP by increasing its accessibility to institutional investors. XRP up in the last seven days. Source: Coingecko A Speculative Outlook With Underlying Uncertainties It’s crucial to remember that Steingraber’s vision is entirely speculative. As of today, no asset manager has taken concrete steps towards applying for an XRP ETF. Furthermore, the justification for such a high premium rests heavily on the assumption of substantial institutional demand, a factor that remains uncertain. Related Reading: Analyst Bullish On Polkadot (DOT), Predicts $17 Price Target Before April The applicability of the Grayscale Litecoin Trust comparison also requires further scrutiny. The specific structure and features of an XRP ETF would significantly influence whether a similar premium dynamic would emerge. A Reality Check For Investors While Steingraber’s prediction has certainly captured the community’s imagination, investors are advised to approach it with a healthy dose of caution. The approval timeline for an XRP ETF hinges on the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s stance on cryptocurrency ETFs. Additionally, competition from other potential ETFs could play a role in determining the premium, if any.

42391084,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69beUg1n,1711607918,"Bitcoin, Ether Could Witness Upside Volatility as $15B Options Expiry Looms","On Friday, leading crypto options exchange Deribit will settle bitcoin and ether options contracts worth $9.5 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively.  Deribit’s Luuk Strijers told CoinDesk that many options are set to expire in-the-money (ITM), which could inject upward pressure or volatility into the market.  Dealer hedging could also breed volatility around $70,000, FRNT’s David Brickell said.  The impending quarterly expiry of bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH} options contracts worth several billion dollars could breed bullish price volatility, according to observers.  On Friday at 08:00 UTC, Deribit, the world’s leading cryptocurrency options exchange, will settle quarterly contracts worth $15.2 billion. Bitcoin options account for $9.5 billion or 62% of the total notional open interest due for settlement, while ether options comprise the rest.  The $15 billion expiry is one of the largest in the exchange’s history, Deribit data show. The expiry will wipe out 40% and 43% of bitcoin and ether’s total notional open interest across maturities.  Notional open interest refers to the dollar value of the number of active contracts at a given time. On Deribit, one options contract represents one BTC and one ETH. The exchange accounts for over 85% of the global crypto options market. A call option is a type of financial contract that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to purchase an underlying asset at a preset price at a later date. A put gives the right to sell.  Luuk Strijers, chief commercial officer at Deribit, said large amounts of options are set to expire in-the-money (ITM), which could inject upward pressure or volatility into the market.  A call option expiring ITM has a strike price lower than the underlying asset’s going market rate. On expiry, the ITM call gives the purchaser the right to buy 1 BTC at the strike price (which is lower than the spot market rate), generating a profit. A put option expiring ITM has a strike price higher than the underlying asset’s going market rate.  At the going market rate of around $70,000, bitcoin options worth $3.9 billion are set to expire in the money. That’s 41% of the total quarterly open interest of $9.5 billion due for settlement. Similarly, 15% of ETH’s total quarterly open interest of $5.7 billion is on track to expire in the money, as data from Deribit shows.  “These levels are higher than usual, which can also be seen in the low max pain levels. The reason is, of course, the recent price rally. Higher levels of ITM expiries might lead to potential upward pressure or volatility in the underlying,” Strijers told CoinDesk.  The maximum pain points for BTC and ETH's quarterly expiry are $50,000 and $2,600, respectively. The max pain is when option buyers stand to lose the most money. The theory is that option sellers (writers), usually institutions or traders with ample capital supply, look to pin prices near the maximum pain point to inflict maximum loss on option buyers.  During the last bull market, bitcoin and ether consistently corrected lower in the direction of their respective max pain points only to resume the rally after the expiry.  Similar dynamics could be at play, according to Strijers.  “The market could see upward pressure as the expiry removes the lower max pain magnet,” Strijers explained.  Dealer hedging  David Brickell, head of international distribution at Toronto-based crypto platform FRNT Financial, said hedging activities of dealers or market makers could boost volatility.  “The big impact, however, is [from] the gamma positioning of dealers into the event. Dealers are short some $50 million of gamma, with the majority focused at around the $70,000 strike. As we near the expiry, that gamma position gets larger and the forced hedging will exacerbate volatility around $70,000, providing for some whippy, choppy moves either side of the said level,” Brickell told CoinDesk.  Gamma measures the movement of Delta, which gauges the option’s sensitivity to changes in the underlying asset’s price. In other words, gamma shows the amount of delta-hedging market makers need to do to keep their net exposure neutral as prices move. Market makers must maintain a market-neutral exposure while creating liquidity in order books and profiting from the bid-ask spread.  When market makers are short gamma or holding short options positions, they buy high and sell low to hedge their books, potentially amplifying the price.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/03/28/bitcoin-ether-could-witness-upside-volatility-as-15b-options-expiry-looms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/151e3ce6165f8a99f1be8fccec1b180ddf441086-1278x719.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This time, the project’s marketing team made the headlines after a viral video of female Cardano users became viral on social media. The ‘Cardano Girls’ video has sparked a conversation about the project’s efforts to reach a broader audience. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Eyes Explosive 2000% Bull Run, Targeting $12 And Quadrupling ATH A Breath Of Fresh Air In The Community The ‘Cardano Girls’ video was uploaded by Lily Brodi, a content creator and Cardano user, and went viral in hours. The video recreated a popular social media trend of people playfully listing stereotypical practices of a group of people with the phrase “We are (group). Of course, we…” The trend, recreated by millions, including famous personalities like Kim Kardashian, has reached the crypto community. Last week, a “Crypto Girls” version of the trend was uploaded on X, which prompted Brodi to make her own. Brodi’s version approached the point of view of female Cardano investors, with the opening line setting the lighthearted and playful tone: “We’re Cardano girls. Of course, we are real.” The list in the video includes how female ADA users “treat themselves with money saved on gas,” “have Charles as their phone wallpaper,” and “buy $ADA while the men create all the drama.” At the time of writing, the viral video had over 1.5 million views on X. Its massive reach resulted in the acknowledgment of Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, referred to as “Cattle Daddy” in the video. Lol, I'm blushing. Thanks for all the support and love — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) March 25, 2024 ‘Cardano Girls’ And Marketing Team Face Criticism The video didn’t go unnoticed by critics, who considered the video to be “cringy,” while others expressed opinions seemingly based on misogyny. Crypto influencer Peter McCormack replied to the X post stating that the video will be used “as torture at Guantanamo Bay.” However, the video appears to be well-received by the Cardano and crypto community. Brodi addressed the male detractors in an X post: after the last 24 hours, i’ve realised that a lot of men haven’t felt the warm embrace of a woman — LILY (@lilybrodi) March 26, 2024 Nonetheless, the video opened a broader conversation despite the critics. On one hand, it highlighted how the male-dominated crypto industry can be unreceptive and aggressive to women in the space. On the other hand, it pointed out a crucial issue for Cardano: its “unattractiveness.” The Need For A New Approach Brodi discussed the video’s immense impact, as it seemingly brought general interest in the project, with people reaching out to her curious about the Cardano wallet. Despite its technology and the knowledgeable people inside the community, the project doesn’t seem to attract the general user. Brodi, who creates light and informative Cardano-related content, considers that the general content offered can be “too heavy” and “overwhelming” to those who know about the industry and even more to those who don’t but want to come in. real talk #CardanoGirls & cardano marketing pic.twitter.com/XePfmHiXGN — LILY (@lilybrodi) March 27, 2024 Cardano’s marketing problem, as highlighted by Brodi, has often prevented potential users from entering. She suggests that a change in the market strategy is “needed within Cardano” for broader adoption. Lighthearted, fun, and enjoyable educational content that can be easily consumable can be fundamental for broader adoption. Investors can be attracted to projects that seem easily understandable and approachable. As seen with the memecoin mania, projects can become massive, even if the long-term technology and planning aren’t developed by launch. The crypto community is undoubtedly filled with people who enjoy various content and projects. But “bringing light and fun” enjoyment is crucial to supporting adoption because, at its core, “that’s what our community is.” Related Reading: Here’s Why The Cardano Price Is Struggling Below $0.7 ADA is trading at $0.64 in the 3-day chart.

24888514,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=600072,1711591246,Ondo Finance Joins BlackRock Tokenized Fund As Inflows Surpass $160M,"BlackRock, one of the largest asset managers globally, has witnessed notable success with its newly launched tokenized money-market fund, BUIDL. The fund, which records shared ownership on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, has attracted over $160 million in just one week since its debut. BlackRock’s BUIDL Fund According to a Bloomberg report, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) primarily invests in cash, US Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements. The fund rewards its holders with a cryptocurrency, BUIDL, valued at $1 per token. Shareholders can transfer these tokens to other validated addresses using digital wallets approved by Securitize, BlackRock’s partner for the investment vehicle. The tokenized fund serves several key use cases, including treasury management for crypto companies, support for derivatives of Treasury bills, and acting as collateral for borrowing and trading, thus providing an alternative to stablecoins. Related Reading: Bitcoin “Liquid Inventory Ratio” Hits All-Time Low, What It Means It is worth noting that Securitize Markets, an SEC-registered alternative trading system, plays a critical role in facilitating the transfer of tokens between market participants. While the SEC has recently increased its scrutiny of Ethereum’s native token, ETH, Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo emphasizes that the investigations should be separate from the underlying blockchain infrastructure. Domingo also highlights the battle-tested nature of the public Ethereum blockchain, which provides a “robust foundation” for tokenization activities. As previously reported by our sister website, Bitcoinist, BlackRock has emerged as an advocate for cryptocurrencies and tokenization within mainstream financial institutions. Chairman and CEO Larry Fink believes every financial asset will eventually be tokenized. The company’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has already attracted more than $13 billion in inflows since its launch as an exchange-traded fund (ETF) in January. With the BUIDL fund’s launch, BlackRock continues to demonstrate its willingness to explore new digital asset solutions. Ondo Finance To Transfer $95 Million In Assets To BlackRock Ondo Finance, a platform specializing in tokenized real-world assets (RWA), has moved $95 million worth of assets to BlackRock’s BUIDL fund. This strategic move enables Ondo Finance to facilitate instant settlements for its US Treasury-backed token, OUSG. This makes Ondo Finance a major participant in the BUIDL ecosystem. According to on-chain researcher Tom Wan, it currently holds $15 million worth of BUIDL tokens, which, in addition to those above $95 million, will result in a substantial $110 million worth of BUIDL tokens. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Cardano Price Is Struggling Below $0.7 The researcher noted that this collaboration further strengthens the tokenized US Treasury market, with the potential to reach $1 billion in value. In its announcement, the team behind the Ondo Finance platform summarized: We’re excited to see BlackRock embracing securities tokenization with the launch of BUIDL, especially its broad cooperation with ecosystem participants. Not only does this further validate our original concept of a tokenized US Treasury fund, but it also bolsters our thesis that tokenization of traditional securities on public blockchains represents the next major step in the evolution of financial markets. At the time of writing, the native token of Ondo Finance, ONDO, is trading at $0.909, exhibiting a surge of over 4% within the past 24 hours. This positive momentum adds to its impressive price uptrend of 115% recorded over the past 30 days.

24886688,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=600051,1711587609,$9.5 Billion In Bitcoin Options Poised To Expire This Friday: Market Turbulence Ahead?,"This Friday, the spotlight is turned to Deribit, the leading crypto derivatives exchange, as it gears up for a notable event in its trading history. Particularly, the exchange is poised to witness the expiration of over $9.5 billion in Bitcoin options open interest. For context, Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as futures or options, that have not been settled or closed. It represents the number of contracts market participants hold at the end of each trading day. This surge in open interest recorded by Deribit reflects increased market participation and signals heightened liquidity, marking a notable milestone in the crypto derivatives landscape. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s ‘Next Leg Higher Has Started,’ Says Analyst: Reveals $100,000 Target On The Horizon Record-Breaking Open Interest Notably, this event is significant in two ways: It underscores the growing interest in Bitcoin as an asset class and highlights the increasing “sophistication” of the cryptocurrency market. This is because Open interest can also serve as a critical indicator of market health and trader sentiment. As such, the record levels of open interest set to expire on Deribit suggest a “vibrant” trading environment, with more investors engaging in complex financial instruments like options. According to Deribit data, the exchange is set to host one of its largest option expiries ever, with $9.5 billion worth of Bitcoin options poised for expiry at the end of the month. This figure represents a substantial portion, approximately 40%, of the exchange’s total options open interest, which stands at $26.3 billion. The magnitude of this expiry event eclipses previous months, with January and February end-of-month expiries totaling $3.74 billion and $3.72 billion, respectively. This trend indicates a large increase in market activity and investor engagement on the platform. Implications Of The Bitcoin Expiry The upcoming expiry has notable implications for the market, especially considering the current pricing dynamics of Bitcoin. With Bitcoin’s spot price hovering below $70,000, an estimated $3.9 billion of the open interest is expected to expire “in the money,” according to Deribit analysts, presenting profitable opportunities for holders of these options contracts. The “max pain” price, which represents the strike price at which the highest number of options would expire worthless, thereby causing the maximum financial loss to option holders, is identified at $50,000. According to the analysts, this scenario suggests that a significant number of traders are positioned to benefit from the current market conditions, potentially leading to “increased buying activity” as these options are exercised. Additionally, Deribit analysts speculate that the high level of “in-the-money expiries” could exert upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price or amplify market volatility. They added that as traders “hedge their positions” or “speculate on future price movements,” the market may witness a flurry of activity, impacting Bitcoin’s price trajectory in the short term.

24884906,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=600058,1711584044,"Breaking Records: Mantle (MNT) Soars 40% In One Day To New All-Time Highs, Next Target Revealed","Layer 2 (L2) blockchain Mantle (MNT) has demonstrated remarkable performance, surpassing most of the top 100 cryptocurrencies in the market. The token has surged by 40% in the past 24 hours, reaching a new all-time high (ATH) of $1.49. Mantle Network’s Layer 2 Solution Mantle Network operates as an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible L2 scaling solution to provide a deeper understanding of the protocol. It leverages Optimistic rollups to enable fast and cost-effective transactions. The unique aspect of Mantle lies in its modular design, which combines Optimistic rollups with a separate data availability layer. Unlike traditional blockchains, Mantle’s approach involves handling the four key blockchain functions on different layers. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Cardano Price Is Struggling Below $0.7 Mantle’s transaction execution function occurs on its EVM-compatible execution settlement layer. Blocks are generated on the L2 execution layer by Mantle’s sequencer, which then submits state root data to the Ethereum mainnet. This architecture significantly reduces transaction costs compared to the base layer and improves network efficiency by separating the layers. Additionally, the implementation of Optimistic rollups minimizes the overall load on nodes. MNT Surges As Staking Launches One of the potential catalysts behind the recent surge in MNT can be attributed to the introduction of MNT staking, as highlighted by crypto researcher Alex Wacy. According to Wacy, the Mantle Rewards Station plays a key role in this staking initiative, offering rewards to MNT stakers from the Mantle Ecosystem. By participating in staking, users contribute to the network’s security and operations while also being incentivized through these rewards. The staking process begins with the Ethena event, where users receive mShards tokens. These tokens have value within the Mantle decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, allowing users to perform various decentralized finance activities within the network. These activities may include trading, investing, or interacting with various DeFi protocols and applications built on top of Mantle. In particular, mShards can be traded within the Mantle decentralized application (dApp) ecosystem, allowing users to take advantage of potential market growth options. The ability to trade these tokens increases liquidity and fosters an active ecosystem within Mantle. In addition, the researcher notes that mShard token holders will soon be able to redeem for ENA, another token associated with the Mantle Ecosystem. This redemption process adds utility and value to mShards, further increasing their appeal to token holders. The issuance of Ethena shards for Epoch 2 will end on April 1, indicating a limited-time opportunity for users to acquire these shards through staking, which may have further increased interest in the blockchain ahead of the deadline from investors looking to capitalize on this opportunity. Bullish Prospects Examining the figures, MNT has experienced a surge in trading volume, reaching $647,118,249 in the past 24 hours, signifying a substantial 141.40% increase compared to the previous day. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Break $74,000 Driven By TradFi FOMO? The market capitalization of the MNT token stands at $4,157,261,742, propelling it to the 33rd position on CoinGecko’s rankings. Over the past 7 days, Mantle (MNT) has outperformed the global cryptocurrency market, which has seen a 2.30% increase, and similar cryptocurrencies within the Ethereum ecosystem have risen by 12.70%. The MNT token has retraced to the $1.27 level, marking a 2% decline in price over the past hour. Despite the temporary setback, the token’s strong momentum suggests potential trading risks and opportunities. It is worth noting that the next identified support line for the token is at the $1.080 level. If this support level fails to hold, the token’s price could drop further, potentially reaching the $1 mark. The next significant resistance level would be at $0.94. However, if the bullish momentum continues throughout the week, the token may target the $1.60 and $1.68 levels before potentially surging towards the $2 mark.
