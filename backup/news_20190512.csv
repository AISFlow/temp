He wrote in a brief update:    Our team is making progress and has been working through the weekend. In the past few days, we have made some significant overhauls to our system, with a large number of advanced security features added and/or completely re-architected. We will share details on some of the changes later.      We aim to fully resume deposits and withdrawals on Tuesday. The time will be communicated at a later stage, depending on how the testing goes. This upgrade will require a trading halt. We will update you again tomorrow.    Currently, all withdrawal and deposit actions are marked ""Suspend"" and cannot be carried out on the exchange. However, at least one user has said on social media that they were able to send deposits to the address by way of previously identified addresses.  In previous announcements the exchange announced upcoming support for hardware-based 2FA devices like YubiKey.  Binance announced the breach last week, saying that unnamed hackers made off with 7,000 BTC (worth about $41 million at the time) from the exchange's hot wallet. The hackers accessed both user API keys and two-factor authentication codes to withdraw the crypto.  The exchange stopped withdrawals and deposits but allowed intra-token trading on the site. The hackers quickly moved the stolen bitcoin, causing some to speculate that they are preparing the launder the money through multiple exchanges.

42381898,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9q3MZ,1557676757,Ethereum's Reddit Moderators Resign Amid Controversy,"Taylor Monahan, the CEO of crypto wallet startup MyCrypto, has been moderator for the ethereum subreddit channel since 2016.  That year, the ethereum Reddit channel was just breaking over the 10,000 subscribers mark, according to SubRedditStats. Today, the same channel boasts over 400,000 subscribers and is ranked within the top 600 most popular channels on Reddit.  However, what may have started as a relatively low-commitment and low-visibility responsibility became a flash point of controversy in the ethereum community (though tensions have died down in recent days).  “Back then, there weren’t any guidelines or rules.” Monahan told CoinDesk. “We [the moderators] were all cut from the same cloth. We all had the same natural philosophy about what we should and shouldn’t do...We were pretty light-handed and mostly just removed scams and spams and stuff.”  Those duties include: approving posts that were incorrectly removed by the automoderator, removing posts that break the subreddit’s stated rules, bringing posts that require subjective decision-making to the attention of the entire moderation team, and other responsibilities that, in sum, seek to halt the spread of spammy or scammy content.  But the nature of the gig has changed, according to Monahan.  “One of the biggest differences between the early days and now is that in the early days we really did look at this as an administrative task...The larger community doesn’t look at it like that and that’s where I think the disagreement and the anger and the yelling came from,” said Monahan to CoinDesk.  The anger and the yelling Monahan refers to has been explicitly targeted at former ethereum core developer Afri Schoedon and director of the Web3Foundation Ryan Zurrer. As a result of community requests for their removal as moderators, both individuals in recent weeks have resigned from the role.  Most recently, Nick Johnson – developer for ethereum domain service ENS – also resigned, quoting a lack of time to “meaningfully contribute” and “an unhealthy streak of paranoia, conspiracy mongering and insularity” on the subreddit.  The remaining ten moderators of the ethereum subreddit have voiced varying degrees of concern about their role given that their responsibilities on the social media forum are now more heavily scrutinized by the public.  “The more people are on the sub, the higher the chance is one of your actions does not resonate well and in the worst case resonates so badly that the result is a full blown shit storm,” ethereum Reddit moderator “Ligi” told CoinDesk.  A way forward?  Internet communities are rarely immune from controversy, and ethereum's Reddit-centric users are no exception.  And in cases where a situation intensifies and a moderator's role is called into question, Monahan maintains that the best course of action is a self-resignation approach, as has been previously seen.  “As a group of moderators, we don’t want to ever hold a vote to cast another moderator out. That’s just terrible.” Monahan told CoinDesk. “If there is a large amount of drama surrounding a certain mod or if there is a call for that mod to leave, instead of coming up with a mechanism where everyone votes, it would be on that moderator to remove themselves and step down.”  For the most part, this is exactly how the most recent bout of controversy over subreddit moderation in the ethereum community has been diffused.  Earlier this month a tweet by Ameen Soleimani, the CEO of adult entertainment blockchain platform Spankchain, accused Schoedon of working on a competitor platform to ethereum known as Dothereum.  “I can’t actually prove that he wrote the code yet because it isn’t public, but I have heard from credible sources that he is contributing,” tweeted Soleimani. “There’s nothing wrong with anyone working on whatever they want...but we should also realize that ethereum defectors are highly incentivised to try and divide our community.”  The situation was further enflamed by user “McDongger” who called for the removal of Schoedon as a result of his engagement with other blockchain projects. Zurrer faced similar resignation calls for his involvement in creating the blockchain interoperability platform that Dothereum is built on.  In his resignation post, Zurrer put forward his belief that ""the line between 'working on ethereum' and working on other things will blur as we move forward.""  “However, in the interest of focusing the conversation around the technology, let’s have some other community members take a turn at mod-ing so that this isn’t a debate topic,"" he went on to write.  Additionally, Monahan has also offered up a 3,000 word document codifying expectations moving forward for both users and moderators on the subreddit. As stated in the post, its aim is to ""provide transparency into the role of /r/ethereum moderators and define what is expected of those moderators.""  “One way to prevent conflict now or in the future is by making sure everyone is all on the same page and communicates and is transparent and the expectations are aligned,” Monahan told CoinDesk, adding:  “If you can do that then I think most the issues with not just moderation but just in general can be resolved.”  Reddit image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,ENS,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | ENS,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/05/12/ethereums-reddit-moderators-resign-amid-controversy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bcb5572e83719f096c8e971f520ede924824ae6d-1000x682.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Then how that engine performs in the field, when to repair it and then re-enter it into the field.”  While GE Aviation sells aircraft engines to commercial airlines and the military, GE Aviation Digital Group is a business unit within that which employs some 700 staff globally and sells software externally to the industry. As well as blockchain, the group turns out a range of 3D printing, IoT and data science solutions.  Havara said his team had been working for more than two years with partners like MTU Maintenance to build the blockchain, a permissioned fork of ethereum.  “What we are calling it, kind of internally, is TRUEngine,” said Havera.  Having a blockchain will structure data that’s critical to this ecosystem in a single format and bring it to users’ fingertips; typically the process of data analysis can involve threading back through multiple vendors and ERP systems, noted Havera, adding:  “If you think about it, a quality event in the aircraft engine industry is catastrophic. And to research that takes months of manual time. Driving efficiencies, accountability and visibility into the process of making an engine will make us all safer.""  Mike Walker, the senior director of applied innovation and digital transformation at Microsoft, likened the ledger to a “tapestry.”  He said it has had the effect of “stitching together [GE Aviation's] entire supply chain into one view – so you’ve got a full understanding of all the partners; you’ve got one ecosystem repository instead of hundreds, if not thousands.”  Blockchain boneyard  Aircraft engines are liquid assets: over a five-year period, some 60 percent of them change hands, Havera said, making documentation and certifications important.  Part of the process involves customers like Delta or British Airways, for example, maintaining flight history records of how many cycles they have flown on each part, data which are then returned to GE Aviation so that the appropriate parts are replaced in a timely manner. This has led to a paper-based conundrum, said Havera.  “We can’t sell those used parts back into the open market without the proper paperwork,"" he said. ""Which is really a crisis in the industry at the moment. At our warehouse facility in Texas, there are tens of millions worth of dollars of inventory orphaned, because over the last 20 years we didn’t have a digital solution to get that paperwork to sell those parts back into the market.”  Walker of Microsoft added:  “So what we have done brings cost optimization and significant safety improvement, but now we are exposing a new business model. We are creating a profit center for what I lovingly referred to as ‘the boneyard’ in Texas, where essentially they put all these parts where they don't have the GE Aviation genuine paperwork – and you can do that for all the other boneyards out there, too.”  Although he could not mention the names of the industry players who have been invited to join the TRUEngine consortium at this time, Havera said:  “We are targeting companies who have already bought our engines – so it could be Delta or Southwest or BA – and they have a maintenance contract with us. We have a kind of 'razor and blades' business model where we sell you the engine and then you will sign a maintenance agreement to be TRUEngine-certified and we will maintain that. So, we are rolling this out to our maintenance agreement base.”  Walker defined the blockchain as “a production pilot” using live data and business processes with real customers. “So we have a controlled rollout, a trickle effect,"" he said. ""We will have three or four airlines and then another trickle out to reach five or six.”  Havera said the pricing model for the service has not yet been formalized but added:  “We are ready to sell this service. We are actively engaging with customers now and more airlines are asking about it every day.”  Airplane image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | WALLET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/05/12/codename-truengine-ge-aviation-microsoft-reveal-aircraft-parts-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/61d827c0989f7f84c1de8f2479f49dea46fd4af9-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42381903,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9q3Sr,1557669564,"Blockchain's Adoption Challenge Is a Human Problem, Not Technical","Maja Vujinovic, a member of CoinDesk’s advisory board, is the CEO of OGroup LLC and a former Chief Innovation Ofﬁcer of Emerging Tech & Future of Work at General Electric.  The following article originally appeared in Consensus Magazine, distributed exclusively to attendees of CoinDesk’s Consensus 2019 event.      As technology infiltrates our lives, a fundamental conflict is emerging in society, one brought on by two, intertwined forces. First, our existence is framed by a never-ending race for efficiency and productivity, or in the case of the crypto community, for the perfect model, for perfect consensus. But this clashes with the human search for a purpose and meaning, whose discoveries often invalidate applications of technology that otherwise seem perfect on paper.  It’s in this context that the broad concept of “blockchain” matters. Since my very first encounter with it in 2011, and over the course of my experience as an investor, entrepreneur and corporate executive in this space, I have come to this realization: blockchain is not a technology. In isolation, as a model, it will not be the solution to all our problems as propagated by innumerable hyped-up articles. “Blockchain” as a concept has the potential to be extraordinarily powerful if and only if, we as a society are willing to change our own direction and purpose.  The core characteristics of blockchain, with its intent to generate an ostensibly immutable record of history, a commonly shared “truth,” offer us a fresh opportunity to re-think and re-design our behavior, to organize our decision-making and to reach the heart of our existence. It forces transparency while highlighting human inefficiencies, bringing to light our propensity to deceive in order to usurp power. And it highlights that it is we, the humans in the middle, who stand as the principle obstacles to our efforts to build the best version of our societies, our companies and our world.  In short, the principles that underpin blockchain point to a potential resolution of the conflict that technological change imposes on our search for meaning. The irony is that if that potential is to be realized, we must also embark on some deep soul-searching and enact change from within.  The real obstacle – a megalomaniac culture  On can be forgiven for concluding that those with the power to organize modern society have imbued it with a kind of melancholy meaninglessness. We take on jobs that do little else but shuffle papers, or we move financial line items from one place to another, often without adding any productivity or positive outcomes.  We complicate things, we create charts and models and presentations to uphold our smarts, our egos and most importantly, our power. Having lived and worked in 14 different places around the world, I can vouch for the fact that this power-driven structure, a system that thrives on fear, is universal. Human society itself needs to change before technologies and new ideas can have a meaningful impact we seek.  Without that, “blockchain” will be nothing but a buzzword.  We’re all aware of the resistance to innovation that exists within companies and other organizations, but we tend to describe it in clinical, structural terms and so miss the bigger picture. We need to go deeper.  We must address the underlying fears that guard against meaningful change. Unless we stop being avaricious, this hype of “blockchain” will only have random impact in random places. We will be back to “shuffling,” and this time not of paper but of exabytes and exabytes of data controlled and manipulated by an exclusive few.  A human problem, not a technological one  The limits to blockchain realizing its potential are typically described by computer scientists in terms of the “scaling problem:” that it is too costly to amass the massive amount of computational power needed to replicate the processing of all the world’s  transactions “on chain” across multiple nodes. This is indeed a problem, but it’s one that some very smart people are striving to overcome.  I believe a far greater obstacle to blockchain’s success lies in our collective lack of imagination and in a generalized unwillingness to create models that do not feed into the current capitalist system. The success or otherwise of blockchain solutions is too often framed in terms of the quarterly results expected by shareholders and by a blind adherence to the incumbent mode of operation.  All of that puts a block on true innovation.  A small example: When I was at GE, we explored ways to better utilize the large amounts of electricity that’s generated when the aviation division conducts legally mandated test of its customers’ engines. Most of that electricity is grounded and left unused. So, we proposed using that excess power to mine cryptocurrencies as an alternative means of financing the aviation division. The CEO of that division nixed the idea. It was too much of a change.  This resistance to change is not just present in the corporate culture of established incumbents. After leaving GE, I entered the startup crypto world, and there I found that similar barriers to open, peer-to-peer collaboration exist within crypto developer communities.  Power, competition and profit motives create these barriers and lead to a waste of resources, ideas and time. The central issue of self-interest results in a duplication of work. Ten different companies will tackle the same problem, each developing their own  “best versions of blockchain.” They compete for dominance when a collaborative approach could better solve the problem at hand.  Technology is not the obstacle here. If blockchain is to scale to the point where it can be relevant to the existing economy, then, we also need to change the mindset and motives that drive the crypto startup community. Harnessing the potential of blockchain is not technology problem, but a human one.  Solution - a radical shift in ideology  All is not lost, though.  There is a demand for change swelling in the general public, one to which all organizations, big and small, must respond. A zeitgeist against surveillance capitalism is going to demand that organizations relinquish centralized control over data and assets, re-empowering users. This will both force and enable companies to embrace aspects of decentralization. Evidence of this shift is already emerging in the rhetoric, if not yet the actions, of social media companies such as Twitter and Facebook, which are talking of promoting decentralized control of assets and identities, of privacy, and of peer-to-peer transactions.  The right to privacy is a basic human right. We are the creators of data that is exploited and owned by corporate giants and the government. In the next generation of the Internet, we need to shift power from these centralized systems to we who reside at  their edges, so that we protect our data and self-monetize the assets that arise from it. Blockchain potentially has a role to play in this, but only if its own ego-driven fiefdoms can step aside and collectively work on standards and systems that are in the common good.  We need to foster the development of a systemized collaborative community to bring about the change we need. What does that look like in practice? It means we must create pan-company consortia to develop reliable standards and scaling solutions that aren't hijacked by special interests inside either corporate incumbents or dominant crypto startups.  It means we must define a role for government and civil society in setting the right legal and self-regulatory framework within which blockchain technology can develop in the common interest. It means educational programs to enable thought-leaders and doers who demonstrate an openness and willingness to utilize this technology in creative solutions with a real purpose. And it means exercising agility, not only in the workspace but also in our mindsets – to continuously bend, and not break.  It is our responsibility to inspire this ideological change, to break free of models that optimize only to the demands of the existing capitalist system, It’s difficult, but it’s doable.

42381904,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9q3VN,1557666045,When the Dust Settles: The Bitfinex Probe Reveals Structural Weaknesses,"Noelle Acheson is a veteran of company analysis and a member of CoinDesk’s product team.  The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a free newsletter for the institutional market with news and views on crypto infrastructure delivered every Tuesday. Sign up here.      Just as an earthquake reveals structural problems in buildings, so the news of the Bitfinex probe has laid bare two fundamental weaknesses in crypto infrastructure as a whole. While one is fairly public and much talked about, the other is more surprising and stems from trends developing far beyond the emergence of a new asset class.  Some background if you haven’t been following the news: Last week the New York Attorney General announced an initial probe into (among other things) a cover-up to hide the loss of $850 million of comingled client and corporate funds. Hong Kong-based Bitfinex is one of the sector’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges in terms of overall trading volume, and shares ownership structure with US$-backed tether, which accounts for over 90 percent of the global stablecoin market. Apparently, its payment processor Crypto Capital “lost” $850 million of Bitfinex funds some time in 2018; to cover the shortfall and meet user withdrawals, Bitfinex drew on Tether funds without disclosing the arrangement.  Obviously, many market participants run above-board operations and are continually working to improve their compliance with shifting regulations. But for large swathes of the sector, that is economically, strategically or perhaps even philosophically out of the question.  And even though the sector’s troubles may seem offshore, both literally and figuratively, the fallout has broad implications. For while stronger buildings can withstand tremors, the collateral damage from the collapse of weak structures erected during a growth-fueled rapid build-up can impact both public perception and policy, with lasting consequences.  These consequences are generally constructive, however, as people learn what to look out for, building codes become more rigorous and fault lines are worked around.  In the crypto sector, these fault lines are: 1) the lack of high-level banking services; and, 2) the somewhat overlooked lack of auditing standards.  Lack of banking  While some exchanges have managed to open and keep accounts at large and reputable banks, all will confirm that it was not easy and that it cannot be taken for granted – accounts can be closed at a moment’s notice.  Many have not been able to progress that far, either for jurisdictional issues, concerns over procedures or even the slightest whiff of potential proceeds from money laundering.  Smaller financial operations have emerged to fill the gap, but they tend to lack correspondent networks, payment processing and the reassurance of large balance sheets. Some, as we have seen, even lack any sort of oversight.  Bitfinex has had a long history of banking troubles, which on several occasions has fuelled rumors of insolvency as users struggled to withdraw funds. A report last year indicated that it had procured the services of European bank ING, but it is as yet unclear why, if that relationship was still ongoing, it would need to use the services of an offshore payment processor such as Crypto Capital.  What’s more, the lack of reliable banking enhances the demand for a solution like tether, which enables clients and exchanges to transfer value without the need for payment processors. Better banking will reduce the dependence on stablecoins with unverified backing.  The issue is starting to attract the attention of regulators who realise that investors are more likely to suffer where there is no strong banking support. Last week France announced a possible solution: bank accounts in exchange for regulation. Hopefully this initiative will spread to other jurisdictions, as confidence in cash flows will benefit not only potential users and investors but also the entrepreneurs and developers working to push adoption forward.  Lack of auditing standards  Tether has also had its share of troubles, stemming largely from lack of confidence in the amount of fiat currency allegedly backing the stablecoin. While Bitfinex often assured the public that tethers were fully backed by US dollars, it now turns out those assurances were misleading.  Amid repeated calls for an audit of Tether’s reserves, the company’s relationship with one auditor dissolved in early 2018. A letter produced by the Bahamas-based bank Deltec, which confirmed existence of a funded account, was met with scorn and skepticism.  Why is getting an audit so complicated?  Part of the problem is vocabulary. We say “audit” when we mean “attestation,” and they are not the same thing at all.  An “attestation” can confirm an assertion (such as “there is x amount in this bank account”) at a specific point in time.  But an audited confirmation would require much more detail, such as is this account used to back said stablecoin? Who has access? How are issuance and redemptions handled? Does the company comply with KYC/AML regulations? An “audit” is technically an assurance that a statement is presented according to established standards. These do not yet cover reserve backing of stablecoins.  Even when auditors have “confirmed” stablecoin backing, such as Grant Thornton did for Circle earlier this year, it has been in the form of an attestation. Stablecoin issuer TrueUSD has gone a step further, partnering with a San Francisco-based accounting firm to offer real-time confirmation of reserves, or a “continuous attest.”  Attestations do not give the comfort of audits, though. They are snapshots, not deep dives of due diligence. And while we may soon see standards evolve that encourage official validation of stablecoin processes, for now, auditors seem to be playing it safe.  Why, when there is obviously an increasingly urgent need for the service?  Part of the answer can be seen in another piece of news from last week: crypto custodian BitGo was granted the SOC 2 Type 2 certification, which confirms that it passed a security audit performed by an external monitor. This was performed by one of the Big Four auditing companies (Deloitte, KPMG, PwC and EY) – but BitGo didn’t want to say which one.  It’s possible that the auditor in question wanted to keep a low profile. While all Big Four firms have considerable blockchain teams, one thing is understanding and helping to build applications for a technology – resting your reputation on a public statement, especially when the processes and risks to be validated are notoriously complex, is another thing altogether.  Especially these days, when the accounting profession as a whole is coming under increased scrutiny for quality and trust issues. The role of accountants in the crash of 2008 is still a bone of contention, and the emergence of conflicts of interest has prompted European regulators to call for a break-up of the Big Four. It is understandable that – with some exceptions – they are reluctant to be publicly associated with assets that regulators have not yet fully embraced.  A new skyline  But the Bitfinex mess highlights the need for greater quality control. The sector’s lack of authoritative support from reputable accounting firms can potentially do as much damage as the lack of high-level banking, in that it undermines confidence which in turn will slow down adoption and investment.  The efforts of BitGo and others in getting certifications, and those of the firms supporting them, is appreciated. The sector needs more examples of rigor and compliance if it is to attract the attention of large institutions.  Yet it also needs public support from banks and auditors, not just quiet contracts. It needs more reputable names to be willing to acknowledge relationships. This will boost the confidence of investors – both retail and institutional – in demanding demonstrations of operational quality, which will in turn make the sector more resilient to quakes like the Bitfinex news, and to the aftershocks as more revelations come to light.  As weak structures tumble, more solid edifices will emerge out of the rubble. And around them will spring new ecosystems and networks that encourage more discovery and development, supported by institutions that have already stood the test of time.

42381907,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9q3aP,1557652048,Above $7.5K: Bitcoin Price Hits Highest Level Since August 2018,"Bitcoin’s price rose above $7,500 Sunday for the first time in over nine months, a move that marked a resurgence in the crypto market at large.  The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which accounts for more than half of all the total cryptocurrency market, jumped to $7,577 at 13:36 GMT – the highest price since August 2, 2018, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  The surge, however, seems to have slightly cooled off thereafter, with the price currently trading at $7,100, suggesting the market considered the asset overbought.  The move to nine-month highs has come a day after the last remnants of bearish sentiment were snuffed out, and the trend appeared to switch to a long-term bull market. Notably, the price rally was also accompanied by a surge in 24-hour trading volumes to a record high of $29.33 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  However, its “Real 10” volume – a metric that takes into account trading volume from exchanges reporting honest volume figures as identified in a report by Bitwise Asset Management – currently stands at $1.87 billion, according to Messari.io.  Further, still, bitcoin’s dominance rate, a measure of its market share versus that of other cryptocurrencies, has hit a 17-month high of 59 percent, indicating the broader market has lagged the recent bitcoin price rally.  But bitcoin's dominance rate may drop in the coming days, as the alternative cryptocurrencies are beginning to show signs of life, with names like bitcoin cash, tezos and bitcoin gold flashing double-digit gains at press time.  Meanwhile, other highly ranked cryptocurrencies like litecoin, EOS, XRP, and Binance coin have gained 6 to 9 percent each on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinMarketCap.  What's more, the total market capitalization has risen to a six-month high of $219 billion, while the market capitalization of altcoins has witnessed a flag breakout – a bullish continuation pattern – indicating better days ahead for the alternative cryptocurrencies in general.
