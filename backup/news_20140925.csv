42426074,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIiRhh,1411682431,US Commodities Regulator to Hold Public Bitcoin Hearing,"The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has announced that it will hold a public meeting to discuss bitcoin and digital currencies on 9th October in Washington, DC.  Created in 1975, the US CFTC is an independent federal agency that regulates the country's futures and options markets. The meeting will be presided by the CFTC's Global Market Advisory Committee, a group that advises the organisation on issues related to market integrity and competitiveness.  The CFTC indicated that the meeting will consist of two panels, one of which will focus on examining bitcoin and questions surrounding the CFTC's involvement in the creation of a derivatives market for bitcoin, while the other will center on Non-Deliverable Forwards (NDFs), a form of cash-settled short-term forward contract.  The event will be open to the public, as the full release explains:  ""Members of the public may also listen to the meeting via conference call using a domestic toll-free telephone or international toll or toll-free number to connect to a live, listen-only audio feed.""  Though larger questions about bitcoin's classification as a currency or commodity persist, the agency's first foray into bitcoin is likely to focus on more basic questions.  For example, similar introductory hearings held by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and the US Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) centered on educating those at each respective agency about the basics of the technology, and these agencies are only now moving on to more advanced subjects.  Ongoing debate  Despite the continued regulatory uncertainty in this area, the meeting could mark the first step toward more clarity for the bitcoin industry as to what the CFTC's involvement will be in the industry's markets.  The CFTC has been publicly discussing whether bitcoin meets the definition of a commodity under the organisation's rules since March, the time when TeraExchange moved to secure the agency's approval for its recently launched bitcoin derivative.  At the time, acting CFTC chairman Mark Wetjen indicated that the group was still seeking an internal answer to this question.  “The analysis hasn’t concluded, but I think people believe there is a pretty good argument that it would fit that definition, or there are at least arguments that it would,” Wetjen said at a March conference, according to Bloomberg.  Seeking definition  The CFTC's exploration of bitcoin also comes at time when the bitcoin market is arguably seeing its first influx of more advanced financial trading tools.  Though some resources like Seedcoin-backed BTC.sx have been around for more than a year, new entrants such as BitMEX are now emerging as some of the ecosystem's largest exchanges are adding margin and options services.  Further, prominent members of the bitcoin community argue that such trading activity will have the long-term effect of decreasing volatility in the broader bitcoin market.  Given the evolving nature of this segment in the bitcoin market, many in the industry have called for the CFTC to provide greater clarity on how it will seek to oversee new bitcoin or block chain-based investment tools.

42426075,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIiRjh,1411677935,PayPal: Bitcoin Partnerships Will Help Us Study Consumer Behavior,"Though long rumored, the news that PayPal had formally aligned its business with bitcoin dominated headlines this week due to the company's size, brand recognition and influence as an early pioneer and dominant player in online payments.  For PayPal, the move comes at a time of increased competition in the web and mobile payments space, with tech giant Apple most recently entering the sector with Apple Pay.  As such, there has been much speculation as to how bitcoin could play an increasing role in helping PayPal continue its market dominance while helping ease the still prevalent friction in online payments.  Speaking to CoinDesk, PayPal senior director of corporate strategy Scott Ellison elaborated further on the nature of his company's latest move, but cautioned that, as of now, PayPal plans to tread lightly in the bitcoin space.  Ellison told CoinDesk that PayPal's initial role in its partnership with major bitcoin processors will be to function as an observer, explaining:  ""[We’re looking] to gain insight into the types of consumers using bitcoin and will work with businesses to understand what types of content they are selling more of.""  To start, PayPal will analyze bitcoin buyer behaviour soley on its PayPal Payments Hub, an all-in-one online e-commerce platform that allows businesses to integrate multiple payment options – including bitcoin, credit cards and mobile carrier billing – with ease.  Merchants who use the platform will now be able to implement the existing bitcoin and altcoin processing services provided by BitPay, Coinbase and GoCoin, companies that Ellison called ""the three leading bitcoin payment processors"".  Starting small  While PayPal did not integrate bitcoin into its digital wallet or proprietary payment processing services, Ellison framed this as consistent with PayPal's approach to helping instill new behaviours in its online userbase.  When trying out new technologies, Ellison said, it's common for consumers to start small as they look to test the waters with new buying methods.  Ellison told CoinDesk:  ""Smaller, digital purchases are what consumers might like to try with this new payment method just as they did with then-new mobile operator billing for digital goods like games and ringtones on mobile devices.""  Ellison also suggested that the platform's digital goods merchants may have the most compelling reasons to adopt bitcoin today, citing the digital currency's potential to increase sales and reduce costs for this business segment.  Integration timeline  Ellison further confirmed the statements of BitPay, Coinbase and GoCoin, saying that PayPal has been working on integrating bitcoin into the PayPal Payments Hub for four months.  Though others like Overstock have implemented bitcoin processing services in as little as one week's time, Ellison said that a longer timeline is consistent for this type of company procedure.  ""This is a typical, normal integration timeframe, as we had to ensure we had customer service and partner support ready,"" Ellison said.  However, he said PayPal has been interested in developments in the bitcoin space since 2012, due to the digital currency's potential to reduce friction and cost in the payments space for both businesses and consumers.  Observing developments  Ellison framed PayPal's overall move as consistent with its standard policies of embracing innovation but doing so in ways that ensure the services on its platform are safe and reliable.  He said:  ""We’re proceeding gradually, supporting bitcoin in some ways today and holding off on other ways until we see how things develop.""  Going forward, Ellison indicated that PayPal is hoping to inform more of its merchants about their ability to now accept bitcoin, reaching out through the media and normal communications channels.

42426068,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIiRXh,1411674089,US Banks: Why We Embraced Ripple,"The path for any bank to approach new technology isn’t a simple one. From first learning about a technology to discussing it with regulators and stakeholders, to finally integrating it with existing infrastructure, the timeline often constitutes a lengthy testing and review process.  Yet despite these hurdles and the broader banking industry's apprehension, CBW Bank and Cross River Bank have become the first US institutions of their kind to adopt Ripple's distributed open-source payment protocol.  In conversations with CoinDesk, executives from both banks explained why protocols like Ripple are a step toward what could become an ""Internet of money"", and how these systems can change the way people send money around the world.  Cross River Bank president and CEO Gilles Gade explained:  “It makes the system a lot more efficient. We hope that other banks follow suit, whether they’re community banks or larger banks, that are not in the money centers. I think it would be a welcome addition to have anyone come in on the network and participate in this.”  The companies join Germany-based Fidor as the only banks to adopt the Ripple protocol in a move that represents the US banking industry’s first foray into what is still a largely experimental corner of finance technology.  Early days for new protocols  CBW Bank chairman and CTO Suresh Ramamurthi told CoinDesk that the banking industry has moved slowly to embrace new technologies – particularly open-source protocols. He said the apprehensions shared by many banks today are similar to those expressed in the mid-90s during the early days of the internet.  Ramamurthi said:  “The speed at which you’re able to connect the world now – if you went to someone in 1990 and said that you can connect everyone – they would tell you that you were out of your mind.”  He went on to explain that open-source ledger systems like Ripple allow the ability to create a sort of ""Internet of money"", a term used by other observers to describe how digital currency technologies are developing.  Ramamurthi added that future protocols could potentially emerge, but the options being made available today “meet our needs” and can solve key industry challenges.  Industry needs innovation  Both executives spoke at length about how as an industry, banks understand there are chronic issues that need solving. Ramamurthi said that from an infrastructure standpoint, banks need solutions like Ripple because otherwise they risk being shut out of the globalized banking market by larger institutions.  He told CoinDesk:  “There is a need to connect many other banks in the world in a fairly and market-efficient fashion.”  Gade remarked that given the outsized influence of large banks, smaller institutions that want to grow can benefit from utilizing low-cost solutions like Ripple. He argued that small banks would gain a significant competitive edge by doing so:  “I think there’s a tremendous opportunity here for smaller banks to beat larger banks on cross-border transactions.”  Ramamurthi explained to CoinDesk that a key challenge for banks that send cross-border transactions is making sure those who are sending money aren’t on any terrorist or money laundering watch lists. Given the velocity of money flows, this can create operational issues – and higher costs.  By using real-time settlement ledgers like the one Ripple offers, Ramamurthi said banks can reduce the friction created when meeting government oversight standards.  Call for more banks  Gade said that in order for concepts like the Ripple protocol or distributed transaction settlement networks to work, there need to be more parties willing to participate. He said banks can’t afford to let chronic operational problems worsen over time, and challenged smaller institutions looking to improve efficiencies to consider technologies like the Ripple protocol.  Ripple CEO Chris Larsen told CoinDesk that given banks' conservative nature toward technology, any kind of integration is going to be slow.  He said:  “What we’re focused on is being currency agnostic. Any of these new technologies, it's hard to explain to banks when you have the additional currency and payment rail. That’s a lot of to chew off. So to let them use their own currency, dollar, euro, whatever they’re offering, reduces the friction there.”  Giles said banks that are apprehensive about adopting open-source protocols like Ripple should consider partial roll outs or trial periods. He remarked that a bank’s role is to mitigate risks and improve efficiencies, which makes it imperative that they always be on the lookout for new ways to work better.  Gade added that any bank wishing to learn more about Ripple should reach out and ask questions, and that that ultimately, those banks will find that the Ripple protocol isn’t that far off from what they use today.  “At the end of the day, it’s just a ledger system,” he said.

42426065,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIiRPh,1411663714,Ben Lawsky to Deliver Bitcoin Keynote at Money20/20,"New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) superintendent Benjamin Lawsky is to deliver a keynote speech at Money20/20, which bills itself as the world's largest event for payments and financial services innovation.  Lawsky will take part in the conference's (Bit)coinWorld section and will be one of the star speakers on the subject of cryptocurrencies.  Money20/20  ’s organisers say they are big supporters of cryptocurrencies and their underlying distributed payment protocols. Additionally, as bitcoin generated a lot of interest at last year’s event, they decided to launch (Bit)coinWorld as a forum dedicated solely to the cryptocurrency space.  A number of industry leaders will attend (Bit)coinWorld and the event has been endorsed by Coinbase co-founder Fred Ersham, BitPay chief executive Tony Gallippi, Blockchain chief executive Nicolas Cary, the Ripple Labs team and investor Roger Ver.  “We believe that bitcoin is nearing a tipping point for broad consumer adoption and recognition worldwide,” said Ehrsam.  Gallippi said bitcoin companies need to work effectively with merchants, regulators and other established institutions if they want to realise bitcoin’s full potential, adding:  ""As the premier payments event, Money20/20 is well positioned to make that happen and we're excited help by bringing our expertise and leadership to (Bit)coinWorld.”  Thanks to Lawsky, bitcoin's regulators will have their voice heard at the event too.  BitLicense – a mixed bag for bitcoin  Lawsky became a prominent figure in the world of bitcoin regulation in early 2014, after the NYDFS announced it would hold hearings on bitcoin. The hearings were held in late January and Lawsky’s department eventually announced plans for a comprehensive regulatory framework for New York State’s bitcoin businesses.  The NYDFS unveiled its controversial list of proposed rules and regulations in July and industry reaction has not been overwhelmingly positive.  The so-called 'BitLicense' scheme has been heavily criticised by a large number of bitcoin companies, both in the US and elsewhere. Some commentators have been more open to the idea, however.  Due to the large number of reactions and suggestions, the NYDFS decided to extend the comment period for the BitLicense proposal in late August.  Lawsky explained the need for the extension in a recent interview with CoinDesk, stressing that the NYDFS had to proceed with caution, as it could not risk getting bitcoin regulation wrong. The revised BitLicense proposal should be published by the end of October.

42426071,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIiRdh,1411658622,Swiss Intelligence Service Investigates Paying Informants in Bitcoin,"Swiss intelligence services are reportedly looking into the possibility of using bitcoin to pay intelligence sources abroad.  Documents unearthed in a corruption investigation reveal that the Swiss Federal Intelligence Service (FIS) examined the possibility of using bitcoin in a document dated February 2014, according to the Tages Anzeiger newspaper.  The investigation originally targeted persons involved in the so-called Giroud Affair, which revolved around certain business deals made by winemaker Dominique Giroud, who was arrested in June 2014.  Along with Giroud, a professional hacker, a private detective from Geneva and an FIS agent were also remanded in custody on a wide range of allegations.  Untraceable payments  Notably, a Power Point presentation entitled Bitcoin Feb2014 wasfound on the private investigator's computer, outlining how the intelligence service could use the cryptocurrency to make sensitive payments.  The digital document describes how the FIS could start paying its intelligence assets abroad in bitcoin without leaving a paper trail.  Under the scheme, an unnamed company in Switzerland would be commissioned by the intelligence service to buy bitcoins, which would then be used to make the payments. The recipients, described as FIS sources located abroad, would then exchange the bitcoins for fiat currency.  The document lists the following advantages of using such an approach:  “No couriers, no international bank transactions, solid contract and payment environment, disguise and ‘plausible deniability’, reduced costs.”  The presentation further details how bitcoin could be used to pay foreign sources without generating evidence that could be used to identify the source of the transaction.  The Tages Anzeiger indicates that the FIS has confirmed that the investigation into cryptocurrency payments was authorised by the agency.  Pros and cons of anonymity  While bitcoin's ability to keep its users anonymous has been praised as a means for individuals or organisations to maintain privacy against government snooping, use of the digital currency for illicit transactions has given the cryptocurrency a negative connotation in the wider media and public eye.  In addition to illicit dark web drug bazaars like Silk Road, more nefarious uses of bitcoin behind the Tor barrier have been documented in the past, including the case of a crime syndicate willing to accept bitcoin payments for murders for hire.  However, the FIS scheme and other developments like bitcoin magnate Roger Ver's bitcoin bounty platform prove that bitcoin’s relative anonymity could benefit governments and law enforcement too.  Additionally, cryptocurrency has been touted as a means to reward anonymous whistle blowers on government or corporate corruption, or to channel funds to dissidents and political activists across international borders.  Ver's BitcoinBountyHunter.com allows people to place anonymous bounties on criminals, which can be collected by individuals providing information leading to the arrest and successful prosecution of the suspects.  The bitcoin bounty concept was pioneered following an attempted hack earlier this year, following which Ver offered a 37 BTC reward for the arrest of the attacker.

42426070,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIiRZh,1411652863,Huobi Sends $400k to Wrong User Accounts,"One of China's top exchanges, Huobi, revealed that it temporarily lost 920 BTC and 8,100 LTC – worth about $411,000 – yesterday, but added that it had recovered the majority of the assets.  Huobi posted on its official Weibo account that a customer service representative had erroneously deposited the coins to 27 user accounts.  The exchange said that its security department was alerted at 3am this morning and its withdrawal systems were temporarily suspended.  An investigation was launched, and 880 BTC and 5,400 LTC were returned to the exchange by customers who received the funds in error, the update stated.  ""We apologise for the disturbance that we caused,"" the exchange added, according to a translation by Eric Mu, who wrote about the incident on his Forbes Asia blog.  Huobi did not elaborate on how it would recover the remaining funds. It said in a subsequent Weibo update that it would add a step to its withdrawal process requiring approval from its financial department.  Prices on Huobi  appeared to be unaffected by the news of the administrative error. At the time of writing the last quoted price was ¥2,521 on Huobi, ¥2,522 on OKCoin and ¥2,520 on BTC China.  Weibo chatter among bitcoiners in China was skeptical of Huobi's claims. One user likened Huobi to Mt Gox, the one-time leading exchange that imploded earlier this year, saying: ""Mt Gox is beckoning to Huobi!""  Another user  urged calm in the face of the exchange's error, saying that since the issue had been resolved, users should not panic:  ""Everyone, don't panic. [Huobi] will post official updates. Keep going, Huobi!""  Mu, who has also worked briefly at Huobi competitor OKCoin but is no longer employed there, said that the general attitude towards the Huobi announcement was one of scepticism.  ""There is a fair bit of scepticism on Chinese social media, especially because Huobi has recently launched several new services,"" he said, referring to Huobi's US dollar trading and a fixed-rate financial instrument services launched earlier this month.

42426079,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIiRnh,1411633499,OKCoin Tops World BTC/USD 24-Hour Trade Volumes For First Time,"OKCoin made company history today, when its international exchange became the world's most active bitcoin-to-dollar trading platform over a 24-hour period.  The company posted a USD trade volume of 16,342.42 BTC over the most recent 24-hour period on its site, compared to Bitstamp’s 14,463.93 BTC, Bitfinexhttps://www.bitfinex.com/pages/stats’s 15,552.2 BTC, and BTC-e’s 6,556.18 BTC.  While OKCoin has been ahead of BTC-e for the past week, it is the first time the exchange has topped Bitstamp and Bitfinex, which are commonly regarded as the world's most popular.  OKCoin CTO Changpeng Zhao told CoinDesk the increase was surprising, given that the OKCoin’s international exchange only emerged from beta a week ago.  He said:  ""Regarding the increase in volume, honestly, we don’t know exactly why. We focus on making a better product, and believe the users will follow. And the data tends to agree with us.""  Yuan volumes always higher  The volumes are for the main USD exchange only, and do not include OKCoin's CNY volumes (around 69,469.14 BTC) or trades on its new futures platform.  China's 'Big Three' exchanges routinely post BTC trade volumes in CNY that are much higher than those of their overseas counterparts – often up to four or more times higher. This is often attributed to the fee-free trading model employed in that country, which attracts higher-frequency traders both from China and abroad.  Beijing-based OKCoin has been China's top exchange by volume for some time, but only launched its international USD market two months ago.  New 'maker-taker' system  China's large exchanges have been busy in recent months adding features that mirror those available on more established forex market platforms and are designed to attract more professional and international traders to their platforms.  These features are also playing a role in increased trade volumes.  OKCoin just last week launched a new 'maker-taker' model on its international exchange, which it hopes will increase liquidity by rewarding the 'market makers' who set prices on the order book.  Both buyers and sellers usually pay a fee to trade on OKCoin's BTC/USD market, but under the maker-taker system those who set prices will actually earn some of the fees paid by the 'takers' (those who trade at the current market price).  Market makers now earn 0.05% of a taker's fee for orders below the ticker price for buy orders, and above it for sell orders. In futures trading, makers will earn a lower 0.005% of the taker's fee.  Fees for market takers range from 0.20% for entry level accounts, to 0.10% for the highest-ranking 'gold level' accounts and 0.015% for futures traders.  Feature adds liquidity  Since no two orders can have the same time stamp, if two orders are placed simultaneously the first will be counted as 'maker' and the second as 'taker', encouraging faster orders and thus increased liquidity.  Zhao acknowledged the role this model, along with its associated marketing drive, might have played in OKCoin's new top-market status.  ""This obviously attracts volume to OKCoin. But our volumes have been steadily increasing even before that.""  ""It's usually a combination of factors,"" he noted. ""Like any new business, you need to get everything right to succeed. There is no one specific thing what will guarantee you success, at least, we haven’t found it yet.""

42426078,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIiRrh,1411619871,Atlas ATS Introduces 60-Second Price Protection for Bitcoin Traders,"Cryptocurrency exchange Atlas ATS has introduced a new feature that allows users to lock in quoted bitcoin prices for up to 60 seconds before executing a trade.  Called its 'Price Lock Guarantee', the latest feature from Atlas ATS is aimed at enticing payment processors, ATM operators and merchants who accept bitcoin to use the platform as a way to hedge against short-term volatility in the market.  Atlas ATS  CEO Shawn Sloves framed the service as one that helps these market segments better utilize bitcoin as a payment network, while guarding against short-term losses that could occur due to bitcoin's sometimes rapid fluctuations in value against government-backed alternatives.  Sloves said:  ""Merchants and payment processors aren’t going to accept a currency if they have to accept a lot of short-term risk along with it. They want to know that the currency’s value is stable, at least for the amount of time it takes them to convert back to the currency of their choice.""  The new exchange feature provides yet another example of how the bitcoin ecosystem is seeking to reduce bitcoin's price volatility for certain user groups, while preserving it for traders who want to leverage fluctuations for gains.  Atlas ATS is seeking to expand its operations around the globe and currently has local exchange outposts in North America, Europe and Asia.  Enabling weekly settlement  To further encourage bitcoin merchants and payment processors to use this feature, Atlas ATS allows these groups to enter into direct agreements with dedicated market makers who maintain liquidity on its exchange.  As opposed to a traditional bitcoin exchange, where buy and sell orders are subject to conditions in the market, Atlas ATS says the presence of these market actors will help guarantee price-lock quotes at all times.  Atlas ATS suggested that this would help its target groups to develop continued relationships that help them better convert their bitcoin while preserving gains.  ""This allows the parties to settle directly with one another on a weekly basis, alleviating the need to tie up capital with the exchange,"" the company said.  Similar solutions  The feature notably comes at a time when market leaders in the bitcoin industry are searching for ways to reduce volatility for customers.  Notably, Coinapult introduced a price-locking service this July called LOCKS that, while different, aims to cater to those who want protection from bitcoin's price swings.  LOCKS enables users outside the US to peg the value of bitcoin to gold, silver and a host of other assets, so the underlying value can be preserved for those who need to ensure the requisite funds for more immediate payments.  Market observers such as Wedbush's Gil Luria, have predicted that more similar solutions could be forthcoming. Luria cited Coinbase and Circle as two companies that have worked to make bitcoin more palatable to mainstream businesses, without compromising speculators' demand for volatility.
