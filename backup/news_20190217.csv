42381563,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nLKX,1550417458,ConsenSys-Backed Rhombus Reveals New Products for Ethereum Developers,"Rhombus has released new products designed to help further connect decentralized, ethereum-based blockchain applications to real-world data, the startup announced this weekend.  Revealed at the ongoing ethereum conference ETHDenver, the blockchain-based ""oracle"" service will now support currency pairs, asset pricing and blockchain network data. These products can be used for free by developers competing in the annual ETHDenver hackathon.  Co-founder and COO of Rhombus Jeff Rosen explained to CoinDesk:  ""For smart contracts [on ethereum] to do most of the interesting things we want them to do, they have to have some connection to the real world. Blockchains in and of themselves don't have that connection. Oracles are a way to securely bring real world data to the blockchain.""  CEO Rhombus Doug von Kohorn said the oracles can convert US dollar exchange rates into British pound, euro and Japanese yen rates. In addition, hourly updated stock prices for major companies such as Amazon and Tesla were also featured, among a host of other new releases.  Expecting developers at ETHDenver to request new and custom-built oracles throughout the conference, both Rosen and von Kohorn said they are excited to help facilitate the projects that will be created this weekend.  At the same time, Rhombus also released three decentralized applications that leverage their oracle technology.  One of these applications enables a recurring ethereum payment pegged to the US dollar, another allows users to purchase per-minute subscriptions to live video streams and a third application leverages gold price quotes to facilitate asset trading.  ""Subscriptions will be killer [decentralized] apps ... Why should [people] be waiting for a paycheck every two weeks when they can have their payment dripped every second over two weeks?"" posited Rosen.  Rhombus is backed by ethereum venture capital studio Consensys who – along with companies such as MakerDAO, Status.IM and POA Network – are major sponsors of this weekend's hackathon event.

42381576,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nLX7,1550412041,"Rethink, Renew: ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees to Rebrand Crypto Exchange","Cryptocurrency exchange startup ShapeShift is planning a major rebrand this year.  Announced at ETHDenver, an ethereum developer conference being held in Colorado this weekend, ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees said that starting Monday the company will be opening up a closed beta period for selected users so they can try a new version of the cryptocurrency exchange platform focused on simplifying the user experience.  Featuring greater interoperability with ShapeShift's cryptocurrency hardware wallet KeepKey, CMO of ShapeShift Emily Coleman told CoinDesk that the revitalized platform aims to bring together all of the company's disparate products, including cryptocurrency pricing tracker CoinCap.  Voorhees was joined by co-founder of cryptocurrency micropayments service Earn.com Lily Liu, CSO of ethereum venture capital studio ConsenSys Sam Cassatt, and co-founder of decentralized application platform Holochain Arthur Brock on a panel this Saturday about leadership “in times of ambiguity.""  All holding (or having held) positions of executive-level leadership, each panelist was asked to cite one of the hardest decisions they've had to make with their respective crypto businesses.  ""If you're going to be a company in the crypto industry, you're attached to the severe market cycles of the industry. That's full of good and bad,"" said Voorhees.  Voorhees admitted that one of the hardest decisions of his career was the decision last September to introduce know-your-customer (KYC) precautions to cryptocurrency exchange platform, ShapeShift.  ""I felt like I had to do something morally wrong to allow the company to persist...It's a really awful position to be in,"" said Voorhees.  Explaining that he remained ""ethically opposed"" to requiring users of the trading platform to relinquish personal information about themselves, Voorhees conceded the decision to introduce KYC came down to figuring out ""what fights we want to fight"" and thinking about ""the long-term.""  To this, Voorhees has not given up any hopes for a new future where ""any two people freely and without censorship"" can easily participate in monetary transactions, saying:  ""Society is comfortable about this idea that people should be able to talk freely with each other ... the fact that money is treated differently is a huge injustice. I hope that crypto breaks that discrepancy.""  ShapeShift recently saw a third of its staff laid off as a result of the continued market downturn.  'A refocusing of priorities'  Other companies that have had to make difficult decisions in crypto winter were also represented, including venture capital studio ConsenSys, which announced a 13 percent staff cut in early December. Still, both Voorhees and CSO of ConsenSys Sam Cassatt remain adamant that the industry as a whole – outside of market fluctuations – is booming.  ""Pretty much all indicators except the wildly fluctuating crypto prices are great. We have more ethereum developers than ever. We have more government and big business taking us seriously than ever before... Except for that one number, everything's great,"" said Cassatt.  Indeed, ConsenSys is by no means staying idle with their investments. Announced Friday during ETHDenver’s opening ceremonies, founder of the company Joseph Lubin revealed ConsenSys plans to invest $150,000 in the cryptocurrency DAI to blockchain-based employment service Opolis.  This in addition to opening the ConsenSys Grants Program to new applicants, Lubin highlighted exciting plans for the new year saying that people should “expect several token launches in 2019.” All this being encompassed in “a refocusing of priorities,” Lubin put in a former interview with CoinDesk that the next iteration of Consensys – Consensys 2.0 – is focussing on business viability and success “in a real business ecosystem.”  Leveraging multiple ShapeShift products, the revitalized platform will boast added functionality for users to not only covert one cryptocurrency to another but store and manage their assets all on the same non-custodial exchange.

42381580,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nLc9,1550397648,Mayer Multiples: The Metric That Helps Call Bitcoin Bubbles and Bottoms,"Calling precise market tops and bottoms is next to impossible in the volatile cryptocurrency markets. That said, some traders believe identifying speculative bubbles and moments of bearish exhaustion can be made possible through the use of a fairly new metric known as the Mayer Multiple.  Created by noted investor and podcast host Trace Mayer, the Mayer Multiple is defined as “the multiple of the current bitcoin price over the 200-day moving average.”    Mayer Multiple Formula:      Bitcoin market price / 200 day MA value = Mayer Multiple    In technical analysis, it's generally considered a bullish (or positive) indicator when prices are above the long-term moving average (MA), whereas it's considered bearish (or negative), when the price is below the moving average.  However, the implications are not that binary. For example, if the price is significantly higher than a long-term moving average, it's often a sign that the underlying asset has become overvalued or what is commonly referred to as ""overbought."" The opposite is the case when the price falls excessively below the moving average.  The Mayer Multiple essentially quantifies the gap between the price and 200-day MA to identify historical values at which point bitcoin enters a speculative bubble. In other words: when its price significantly exceeds its intrinsic value or points of seller exhaustion.  Mayer Multiple: Bitcoin  When using Mayer Multiple, the two specific values to pay keen attention to are 1 and 2.4. The significance of a 1 multiple is simple: any value above 1 means bitcoin's price has risen above the 200-day MA and any value below 1 means price has fallen beneath it.  By comparing multiples below 1 to its corresponding price action, it is evident that extensive bear markets take place when price finds acceptance below the 200 MA. On the other hand, bitcoin’s market favors the bulls when the Mayer Multiple is above 1 – but there’s an exception.  Any multiple above the 2.4 threshold has historically shown to signify the beginning of a speculative bubble, which is significant because all bubbles eventually burst, causing a rapid depreciation. By conducting simulations based on historical data, Mayer deduced that the best long-term results were gathered by accumulating bitcoin when the Mayer Multiple was below 2.4.  As can also be seen above, the Mayer Multiple has never fallen below 0.237, the value that marked the bottom of bitcoin’s first significant bear market in 2011.  For reference, the 2013-15 bear market reached a price bottom when the multiple showed 0.407 and the lowest multiple since then was 0.509, when bitcoin’s price fell to $3,122 on Dec. 15, according to CoinDesk pricing data.  As the data suggests, bitcoin’s price is now reaching historically oversold levels so its presumed a bottom is in sight, but is still capable of falling further away from the 200-day MA, which is currently sitting at $5,343. Further, evidence suggests that it's highly likely the price finding acceptance above the 200-day MA, creating a Mayer Multiple above 1, would confirm the beginning of a bull market.  And finally  An above-1 Mayer Multiple could be considered a sign of a bull market.  A very high number represents extreme overbought conditions or bubble. BTC, therefore, could see a corrective pullback or an outright sell-off, in which case prices may eventually drop below the 200-day MA, driving the Mayer Multiple below 1.  However, that could turn out to be a bear trap, as a sharp drop from extreme overbought conditions to levels below 200-day MA is usually accompanied by short-term overbought conditions.  An unusually low number could be considered an advance indicator of bitcoin nearing a major bottom.  Disclosure: The author holds BTC, AST, REQ, OMG, FUEL, ZIL, 1st and AMP at the time of writing.
