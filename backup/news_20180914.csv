42381189,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94LRz,1536959709,A Top-20 Crypto Exchange Is Replacing Tether With a Rival Stablecoin,"A top-20 exchange is phasing out an embattled cryptocurrency.  Digifinex has decided to replace tether (USDT), perhaps the best-known ""stablecoin"" designed to maintain a steady exchange rate with the U.S. dollar, with a rival, TrustToken's TrueUSD. Based in Singapore, Digifinex handled $131 million in trading volume over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap, making it the 16th-largest exchange by that measure.  Kiana Shek, Digifinex's co-founder, told CoinDesk she'd been ""looking for ways to get rid of USDT"" for months, adding, ""I simply don't believe in tether but I had no choice"" but to list it.  Speaking of the decision to adopt TrueUSD, Shek said, ""through my research, due diligence, and my communications with the TrustToken team, I have come to appreciate their commitment to industry-leading best practices.""  She mentioned the team's compliance with the U.S. Financial Crime Enforcement Network's (FinCEN) regulations and independent verification by an outside auditing firm.  Tether, the company behind USDT, did not give a comment by press time. The firm has been the subject of much negative attention for over a year now, as it has struggled to convince observers that it holds enough dollar reserves to fully back all the USDT in circulation.  Despite allegations that the Tether's owners and management – which overlaps with that of the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex – are printing money, though, USDT's value remains pegged to $1.00, and many exchanges list multiple trading pairs in USDT terms.  These listings appeal to traders because USDT can be more easily shifted between exchanges than fiat currency. And at the time of writing, tether is the eighth-most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization.  Growing competition  It is notable, therefore, that a large exchange has decided to move away from offering tether trading pairs and adopt a rival stablecoin instead. Given the high number of stablecoins that have recently launched or are set to launch soon, the competition Tether faces is likely to increase.  ""The risk from Tether and the need for a new USD stablecoin is so great,"" TrustToken co-founder and COO Stephen Kade told CoinDesk, ""that exchanges have started trying to create their own."" An example of this trend is the Gemini exchange's recent announcement of a dollar-pegged cryptocurrency.  Kade argued that TrueUSD had an advantage over these rivals, however: ""TrueUSD is live and exchange-agnostic,"" he said.  TrustToken launched TrueUSD in March, the company's head of marketing and communications Tony Pham told CoinDesk, and plans to launch products linked to the yen, euro and other fiat currencies in the future. And if the goal of wide adoption by exchanges sounds ambitious, TrustToken's broader push – to tokenize practically any form of asset – is even more so.  TrueUSD trading will become available on Monday at 15:00, Singapore time. Initially, Digifinex will offer TrueUSD trading pairs with bitcoin, ethereum and tether.  Both tether and TrueUSD trading will remain available for a while, said Pham, before tether is dropped from the exchange.

42381192,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94LUV,1536954316,The $1 Billion Tezos Blockchain Is Officially Launching Monday,"The ""experimental"" phase of the Tezos blockchain is soon to conclude.  Announced today, the Tezos Foundation will officially launch the protocol on Monday, at which point the platform, whose token supply is today valued at more than $1 billion, will no longer be in beta, meaning it will be fully operational and run by its community.  Still, the designation is admittedly a semantic one. Tezos launched a mainnet, or live blockchain version of its software at the end of June, and since then its XTZ tokens have been tradeable.  While the blockchain was being used as intended throughout that time – with the number of network participants and staked tokens on the rise – technically the blockchain could have been paused for maintenance at any time.  Ryan Jesperson of the Tezos Foundation, which maintains the code and pays developers, told CoinDesk:  ""We have been happy to see the network operating smoothly and efficiently over these last few months. The community has been actively engaged, with more than 400 validators ('bakers') scheduled for an upcoming cycle and the community has been developing an array of exciting technologies.""  According to knowledgeable sources, the only outage that occurred on the network happened in mid-July when blocks weren't properly validating for approximately an hour. The problem was addressed, and the blockchain has been running smoothly since.  When it first launched, only the Tezos Foundation validated transactions on the network, but on July 20 the foundation opened up to third-party validators.  Jesperson recently published a large update on the Foundation blog, detailing business updates such as auditing and grant-making, as well as speaking to some of the turmoil that preceded his tenure.  He wrote, ""The turnaround was complex, occurred at high velocity and had us all intensely focused on success. To its credit, the entire team worked through the turmoil and produced exceptional work.""  The previous president of the foundation, Johann Gevers, stepped down in February, after a tenure in which many viewed him as stifling the launch of a protocol that set a record for the largest initial coin offering (ICO) of all time up that point – $232 million in July 2017.  Since Jesperson took over, along with a completely new board, the foundation has partnered with major auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers; actively funded academics, community members and entrepreneurs with interest in contributing to the ecosystem and set up the first set of validation nodes on which to launch the network.  Most recently, it announced funding for TezTech, a Tezos focused software shop with several projects underway, including a trustless scaling and custody solution, as well as APIs and software libraries.  The market capitalization for xtz currently hovers around $882 million, according to CoinMarketCap, with roughly $3 million in trading over the last 24 hours.

Crypto finance company Circle conducted a survey of more than 3,000 individuals earlier this week, finding that a majority of Millennials believe themselves to be ""aggressive"" investors in the technology. Members of other demographics, including Generation X and Baby Boomers, were also polled.  The Goldman Sachs-backed payment platform used SurveyMonkey to collect its results, though it only published responses from users who identified as ""aggressive investors.""  Notably, the results found that nearly twice as many men invest in cryptocurrencies when compared to women. Forty-two percent of male Millennials, 34 percent of men identifying in Generation X and 16 percent of male Baby Boomers have looked into asset classes like cryptocurrencies, versus 27 percent of Millennial women, 19 percent of Generation X women and 9 percent of female Baby Boomers.  Separately, and perhaps unsurprisingly, the survey found that as investors get older, the percentage of ""aggressive"" investors drops, from 65 percent of Millennials to only 25 percent of Baby Boomers.  The insight that women are a minority in the crypto space is not novel. The social trading platform, eToro, surveyed its users this past May, with its report revealing that only 8.5 percent of all users were women. As of March, the company had over 9 million users.

42381188,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94LQj,1536946300,Brave Launches Legal Offensive on Google Ads Data Collection Practices,"Brave, the startup behind the Brave browser and the Basic Attention Token, has filed regulatory complaints against Google and others over what it considers poor privacy protection for users in the online ads industry.  The complaints – filed with the Irish Data Protection Commissioner and the U.K. Information Commissioner on behalf of Brave's chief policy officer Johnny Ryan, Jim Killock of the Open Rights Group, and Michael Veale of University College London – are aimed to trigger an article in the new European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requiring an EU-wide investigation.  Ryan said in a statement:  ""There is a massive and systematic data breach at the heart of the behavioral advertising industry. Despite the two year lead-in period before the GDPR, adtech companies have failed to comply. The industry can fix this. Ads can be useful and relevant without broadcasting intimate personal data.""  As well as Google, the complaints target ""all ad tech companies that broadcast internet users personal data widely in what are called RTB bid requests,"" he told CoinDesk. ""We anticipate that the regulators will order the industry to stop broadcasting personal data in this manner.""  The complainants argue that when users search on Google their personal data and information on their behavior online is broadcast to multiple companies interested in targeting them with ads – and without users' consent. In doing so, they say, Google violates the GDPR's requirement for personal data to be ""processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss.""  The complaint indicates that the adtech industry can therefore process users' information including such data as the content being viewed, location, type of device, unique tracking IDs, or a ""cookie match,"" and IP address. This data can help reveal many aspects of users, such as income, age and gender, habits, social media influence, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, political leaning and other sensitive information, it states.  ""Advertising technology companies broadcast these data widely in order to solicit potential advertisers' bids for the attention of the specific individual visiting the website,"" Brave says.  Once the users' data has been broadcast, its dissemination is impossible to control, the complaint filed with the U.K. Information Commissioner says, adding:  ""The sheer number of recipients of such data mean that those broadcasting it cannot protect against the unauthorised further processing of that data, nor properly notify data subjects of the recipients of the data. ... data breaches are inherent in the design of the industry.""  The complaint is being legally assisted by Ravi Naik, a partner at ITN Solicitors, who previously helped draw up a complaint to the U.K. Information Commissioner against Cambridge Analytica.  ""We have been instructed by clients in numerous jurisdictions to file complaints concerning the behavioural advertising industry. We are confident that any proper appraisal by the authorities of the concerns will lead to a fundamental shift in our relationship with the internet, for the better,"" Naik said in the statement.  The GDPR stipulates that failures to protect personal data can cost violators up to 4 percent of a company's global turnover, but the move against Google, if successful, could have broader implications and undermine the entire online advertising model that internet giants like itself, Facebook and others with huge user databases are now employing, Reuters suggests.  ""People do not – and cannot – fully understand or know how and where their data is used. This seems highly unethical, and does not square with Europe's data protection laws,"" Killock said, also in the statement.  Brave has also announced that, from now on, Qwant, not Google, will be Brave's default search engine in France and Germany.  Founded by the creator of Javascript and co-founder of Mozilla Brendan Eich, Brave provides a privacy-oriented browser which rewards users with tokens.

42381198,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94Lan,1536942071,Ethereum's Constantinople Hard Fork to Activate on Testnet in October,"Ethereum's upcoming hard fork, Constantinople, will activate in a testing environment next month, core developers agreed on Friday.  As detailed by CoinDesk, Constantinople features changes designed to increase the platform's efficiency, alter its economic policy and delay the so-called ""difficulty bomb,"" a piece of code meant to encourage the network to alter its core consensus algorithm.  Speaking in a bi-weekly video call, developers said the upgrade will activate around October 9 on a cross-client testnet, named Ropsten, which mimics the conditions of the ethereum network itself. However, due to the unpredictability of block confirmation times in the testing environment, an exact block number – the way most upgrades are timed within the blockchain space – for the testnet activation has yet to be finalized.  Similarly, the timing for activating Constantinople on ethereum's mainnet, or live blockchain, has yet to be fixed.  Speaking on the call, though, Ethereum Foundation communications officer Hudson Jameson tentatively suggested November or December for the upcoming code change.  Vitalik Buterin, ethereum's creator, was also on the call, and noted that changes resulting from the approach of the difficulty bomb code should not be perceptible for several months, meaning there is little urgency to get the Constantinople upgrade out.  ""It's totally not urgent,"" Buterin said, adding: ""We could probably have three months of safety and likely even more.""  While the ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs) that are a part of the Constantinople upgrade have caused some debate – especially from miners who see their revenue decreasing with a pullback on the issuance of ether – overall the upgrade features minor technical changes.  Developers also discussed EIPs that may be included in a subsequent hard fork named Istanbul – currently planned for eight months after Constantinople executes.  For example, the ongoing dispute around whether ethereum should implement changes to its underlying proof-of-work algorithm to force ASICs — a type of mining hardware that many think causes centralization — off the network, was discussed. While no clear direction was confirmed, ethereum researcher Danny Ryan noted that work on Casper, the proposal for moving ethereum to a new consensus algorithm, is moving forward.  During the call, Ryan said:  ""The bones of the spec is really solidifying.""

42381213,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94LnN,1536937305,Ether Records Highest Daily Trading Volume in 12 Months,"Daily trading volume for ethereum's ether (ETH) token hit a 12-month high on Thursday.  The second-largest cryptocurrency witnessed a 24-hour trading volume of 850,000 ETH yesterday – the highest level since September 15, 2017, according to Bitfinex data. Further, the current weekly volume of $2.9 million is the highest since mid-December, 2017.  Meanwhile, 24-hour trading volume across all exchanges currently stands at $2.33 billion, the highest level since July 18 this year, according to CoinMarketCap.  ETH daily trading volume on Bitfinex  The sharp rise in trading volume indicates the investors have likely bought the recent dip in ETH below $200. Hence, the recovery from the 13-month low of $167 to levels above $200 looks sustainable.  Further, the pick-up in trading volumes validates the bearish-to-bullish trend change signaled by the technical charts.  At press time, ETH is trading at $203, having clocked a high of $224 earlier today.  Daily chart  ETH created a hammer candle on Wednesday as it recovered from 13-month lows and posted a positive follow-through on Thursday, confirming a bullish hammer candle reversal and a bullish relative strength index (RSI) divergence.  The stochastic oscillator is also beginning to move away from the oversold territory having crossed bullish two days ago (Sept. 12).  All this indicates that the sell-off from the July highs above $500 has likely made a low at $167 and the bulls have likely regained control.  Still, there is merit in being cautious as the bearish (downward sloping) 10-day moving average (MA) could put brakes on the technical recovery.  Weekly chart  On the weekly chart, the volume is at the highest level since December. Back then, the cryptomarket as a whole was witnessing rising volumes, courtesy of bitcoin's rise to a record high of $20,000.  Looking at the weekly chart, we can see how prices have spiked both in terms of bearish and bullish growing total volume.  Indeed for most of the year so far, ether's total volume has remained relatively steady with some weeks in March and July experiencing lower than normal levels.  View  Ether's high volume recovery from lows below $170 has likely turned the tide in favor of the bulls.  The cryptocurrency looks set to test the resistance at $250 (Aug. 14 low) in the near-term, albeit after a bout of consolidation.  The bullish case would weaken if prices find acceptance below $200.

In a letter to a member of the European Parliament, ECB President Mario Draghi said a lack of robustness in the technology that would underlie such an endeavor, as well as the high levels of physical cash use cross the EU, meant the option is not on the table at present.  ""The ECB and the Eurosystem currently have no plans to issue a central bank digital currency,"" he said.  Draghi went on to say that distributed ledger technology (DLT), a likely prime candidate for the basis of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), would ""require substantial further development.""  The ECB's own research indicates that, in 2017, cash still made up 78.8 percent of all payments at points of sale across the EU. Payments by credit and debit cards, meanwhile, made up 19.1 percent and the remainder (2.1 percent) were made using other instruments.  The 2017 report stated that, ""This seems to challenge the perception that cash is rapidly being replaced by cashless means of payment.""  While the ECB may not consider DLT yet mature enough to warrant a real world application as the rails of a national digital currency, other centrals banks are increasingly moving to investigate the possibility.  In late August, the Bank of Thailand said it plans to complete the first phase of a proof-of-concept trial for a CBDC by next March. For the effort, the central bank has partnered with eight domestic financial institutionsand will build the product on Corda, a DLT platform developed by consortium startup R3.  China too, is making rapid strides towards the launch of its CBDC.  CoinDesk reported in June that the Digital Currency Research Lab at the People's Bank of China has filed more than 40 patent applications so far pertaining to its planned digital currency – one that would combine the core features of cryptocurrency and the existing monetary system.  Others such as Norway, are investigating their own national cryptos in the face of falling cash use in the country.  That said, like the ECB, other central banks have suggested that now is not the time for launching a CBDC. Hong Kong ruled out the option in May, as did Australia and New Zealand in June.

Bitsy – which has seen investment from Medici Ventures, the blockchain subsidiary of retail giant Overstock.com – says its wallet offers a clean interface for newcomers to the tech, one which hides wallet addresses, transaction verifications and other technical details, though those will still remain accessible for more experienced users.  Hopkins explained:  ""We want the regular bitcoin technical person to appreciate it, but at the same time we want it to be more mainstream, more usable, and until we make it more approachable, we don't think people will use it.""  According to the firm's website, the product will use facial recognition for wallet access on devices fitted with the technology.  To use the new product, users purchase their desired amount of bitcoin in U.S. dollars, and the crypto ""goes right into your wallet,"" according to Hopkins. To transfer bitcoin to someone else, the wallet defaults to a QR code instead of a bitcoin address.  ""If you don't want to worry about the technical stuff, you don't have to. Of course, you have access if you want to look at the verifications,"" she added.  At launch, users will be able to transfer funds chiefly between individuals. However, the company intends for its platform to act as an on-ramp for those looking to purchase goods or services online, as well.  ""That's eventually, probably where we're going. That's the ideal, companies all get a wallet, you send them the bitcoin, they charge you the bitcoin, it can just be another form of payment,"" the CEO said.  To kick start that expansion, Overstock.com will add an integration for the wallet in late 2018 or early 2019, which will enable customers to quickly purchase items for sale on its platform using cryptocurrency. Ultimately, Overstock.com customers will even be able to directly purchase bitcoin through the app.  Moreover, while users in developed nations may already have options to purchase and transact with bitcoin, those who have difficulty accessing banking services may be able to more easily conduct transactions using Bitsy, Hopkins said.

42429659,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0Wlh,1536926442,Korea Taps Samsung's Blockchain Tech to Fight Customs Fraud,"South Korea's customs authority is looking to adopt Samsung's blockchain tech as the backbone of a decentralized customs clearance system.  Samsung SDS, the conglomerate's IT arm, said on Friday that the Korea Customs Service has inked a memorandum of understanding (MoU) that will see Samsung's Nexledger blockchain utilized for the new platform.  Forty-eight domestic institutions, including public agencies and shipping and insurance companies, have also signed the MOU, says the firm, aiming to participate as nodes on the distributed network to bring more transparency to the customs process.  The effort seeks to share the necessary series of export documents from a number of entities, such as customs declarations and delivery forms, and is being designed to ""fundamentally block document forgery,"" as well as make the export process more efficient.  Korea Customs Service started working with Samsung on the blockchain use case back in May, when it joined the tech giant's newly launched shipping and logistics consortium.  As CoinDesk reported in April, Samsung SDS had already started developing its blockchain platform for international shipments – one it expected to reduce costs in that sector by 20 percent.  The new customs initiative is also in line with the South Korean government's overall agenda for driving blockchain adoption in pubic services, having allocated dedicated government funding.  Currently, the Ministry of ICT is focusing on developing six pilot projects for public services, one of which is customs clearance.

42429675,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0XBh,1536922806,Bitcoin Price Takes a $200 Tumble After Eight-Day Highs,"Having dropped back from eight-day highs hit this morning, bitcoin (BTC) price could be in for a bout of consolidation before further upside unfolds.  The cryptocurrency rose to $6,596 earlier today on Bitfinex – the highest level since Sep. 6 – adding credence to the short-term bullish reversal signaled by the symmetrical triangle breakout earlier this week.  However, despite the strengthening bullish case, BTC quickly lost around $200 soon before press time. As if writing, BTC is changing hands at $6,450, having printed an intraday low of $6,355 a few minutes ago.  While the sudden price pullback could force investors to question the sustainability of the corrective rally, the short-term technical charts continue to show that the path of least resistance is on the higher side.  Hourly chart  BTC's retreat from the highs near $6,600 is likely associated with the bearish divergence of the relative strength index seen in the hourly chart.  Indeed, the RSI has adopted a bearish bias, but it is premature to call an end of the technical recovery, as the major moving averages (MAs) – 50-hour, 100-hour, and 200-hour – are still trending north in favor of the bulls  More importantly, the key MAs are capping the downside at press time. This leaves scope intact for a recovery to resistance at $6,800 (multiple daily highs).  Daily chart  On the daily chart, BTC closed (as per UTC) above the 10-day MA yesterday, neutralizing the bearish view put forward by the rising wedge breakdown on Sept. 5.  However, the short-term MA is still sloping downwards. This, coupled with the bearish RSI divergence on the hourly chart could keep the cryptocurrency range-bound for the next 24 hours or so.  It's worth noting that technical recovery usually gathers speed after the short-term MAs bottom out – unless, of course, there is a major positive fundamental news.  View  BTC has retreated from eight-day highs, but the technical recovery is still intact.  The cryptocurrency could consolidate around $6,400 in the next few hours before resuming the journey towards $6,800.  A UTC close below the trendline connecting the June low and Aug. 11 low would put the focus back on the rising wedge breakdown witnessed earlier this month and could yield a drop below $6,000 (February low).

Jerry Cuomo, vice president at IBM Blockchain, wrote in a blog post on Thursday that the directory – called Unbounded Registry – is now up and running, and aggregates a list of decentralized platforms built on various blockchain networks.  The goal, as explained by Cuomo, is to have an information hub that can inform companies who are looking to adopt blockchain what options are out there and how they can participate in projects, especially those built on private networks that are invitation-only.  Currently listed on the registry are efforts launched by both startups and major financial and technology giants such as IBM, Huawei, Oracle, SAP and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.  For each project, the registry provides a brief explanation and a list of recent news events. It further offers a channel – after a sign-up process – for interested parties to directly message the respective teams.  Built on top of the Linux Foundation's Hyperledger Fabric 1.0, Unbounded Registry itself is an open-source application that allows blockchain projects to register their information in a distributed fashion.  Cuomo added that the registry also interoperates with major blockchain platforms, so far including Hyperledger Fabric, R3 Corda, EEA Quorum and Stellar.  Explaining the reasons for the directory, he wrote:  ""We realized from the start that you cannot do blockchain on your own; you need a vibrant community and ecosystem of like-minded innovators who share the vision of helping to transform the way companies conduct business in the global economy.""

42429664,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0Wth,1536913810,"R3's CordaCon Event Sees Big News, Packed Talks and Blockchain Converts","If R3 really is struggling, as rumored in recent months, you wouldn't know it from the crowd at CordaCon 2018.  The annual London gathering hosted by R3 to celebrate everything happening on the Corda platform and its developer community, appeared to be in rude health this year with standing room only in many of the presentations.  The event saw some 1,150 registrations over the two days – exponential growth from last year, noted R3 CEO David Rutter, adding:  ""At this rate I should be addressing you from a packed O2 Arena in two years' time.""  The headline news was the launch of Corda Marketplace, ""a pseudo app store"" or storefront for solutions on Corda (CorDapps) comprising over 200 companies and ""a place where you can discover new partners to help you build CorDapps,"" according to Rutter.  The other big announcement was that the U.K. government's HM Land Registry (which safeguards land and property ownership worth in excess of £4 trillion, including around £1 trillion of mortgages) has chosen Corda as part of its Digital Street project, to make the house buying process simpler, faster, cheaper and more transparent.  ""I'm a commercial guy,"" said Rutter, ""and I started trying to figuring it out at like £1 a house, say – and it's actually damn good.""  Also announced was the R3 Global Trade Finance Forum to be launched in October. The first topic to be discussed will be, ""How blockchain can support EU trade post Brexit"" (the popular term for the U.K.'s imminent withdrawal from the European Union).  Corda converts  Two major plays on Corda are insurance and trade finance. On the trade finance front, there were presentations from TradeIX, part of Marco Polo, and Voltron, the banking group digitizing letters of credit. The insurance stream ran all day, featuring the likes of reinsurance group B3i and U.S.-based insurance consortium RiskBlock  It's notable that both B3i and TradeIX started out building on Hyperledger's Fabric platform before later converting to Corda.  Asked what, if anything, was salvageable from the original work done on Fabric, Sylvain De Crom, chief product officer B3i, said, ""Clearly some of the functional requirements are completely reusable because they don't change with technology. But the language was completely different, the structures were different.""  De Crom said Corda ""provides a ton of tools that are readily usable for developers,"" but added the caveat that B3i used Corda a year later than the work being done on Hyperledger Fabric. ""You are comparing start of 2018 Corda, with start of 2017 Fabric. So some of the tools we had to code ourselves in Fabric were already available in Corda,"" he said.  Developers building trade finance solutions are divided mainly between R3 Corda on the one hand (with Marco Polo and Voltron), and Hyperledger Fabric on the other with groups like we.trade and Batavia.  David Sutter, head of platform strategy at TradeIX, said the goal with Marco Polo was to create ""a cloud agnostic, infrastructure agnostic Android for trade finance – which is clearly not the goal of a we.trade.""  Regarding his own company switching from Hyperledger to Corda, Sutter said, ""Fabric is an open-source protocol, yes, but the way it is supported and operationalized is not done in an open-source manner.""  ""In terms of validating and ordering transactions,"" he added, ""you are really relying on IBM; in terms of deploying a node, you are relying on IBM BlueMix. Corda is cloud agnostic with an open and decentralized governance.""  Code and law  Giving a regulatory perspective on DLT, Chris Woolard, director of strategy and competition at U.K. regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, said the technology has been far and away the most popular with the cohorts of its regulatory sandbox.  Over a third of all participants in the past three years have used blockchain in one form or another, he said, with 14 out of the 29 in the current batch also doing so. He also referenced a mortgages project the FCA undertook with R3.  Woolard said the FCA looks at the question of accountability with new tech like blockchain and AI, and as such he found the ethereum DAO to be a troubling concept, stating:  ""Instead of code is law, we need code that works with law.""  He also pointed out that, whenever a firm outsources some function, they have to tell the FCA, which has come up a lot regarding cloud computing, for instance. He said the regulator is still deliberating whether DLT constitutes material outsourcing.  Finally, a central banker's view on blockchain came from Dirk Bullmann, fintech co-ordinator at the European Central Bank (ECB). Bullmann said the ECB has decided it's difficult to rely on a technology that is relatively nascent.  ""This is not meant to be negative,"" he said. ""We see a lot of development and are sure that one day the technology will be ready for prime time – right now we feel it isn't.""

Takashi Okita, chief executive of SBI Ripple Asia – a joint venture between SBI Holdings and the San Francisco-based Ripple – revealed the website of the application, named MoneyTap, on Wednesday.  While an exact launch date remains unclear at this stage, the site indicates the application is planned to be available in autumn for both operating systems and used for customers of three domestic banks in Japan.  CoinDesk reported in March that SBI Ripple Asia revealed the project was supported by the Japan Banking Consortium it leads, together with Ripple who lends technological support.  SBI Ripple Asia said at the time that the service would be first rolled out for consumers of SBI Net Sumishin Bank, Suruga Bank and Resona Bank, three members of the consortium. After an official launch, it expected to expand the service to another 61 members of the banking consortium.  The application will let customers conduct domestic transactions 24 hours a day and seven days a week by using a phone number or scanning QR codes in an effort to eliminate the time constraint imposed by traditional banking methods.  SBI Ripple Asia is not the first major banking firm to roll out a consumer-facing application enabled by Ripple's distributed ledger technology, however.  As reported, global banking giant Santander launched a similar service in April for cross-border foreign exchange among the bank's consumers in Spain, the U.K., Brazil, and Poland.

42429688,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0Whh,1536897651,Ethereum's Vlad Zamfir Claims Milestone In Blockchain Sharding,"Ethereum might just be one step closer to sharding its blockchain.  At least that's according to long-time blockchain researcher Vlad Zamfir, who claims to have coded up a successful proof-of-concept of the idea at the ethereum hackathon EthBerlin this week. Built with the help of several other developers, including Tim Beiko, Steve Marx, and pseudonymous coder ""maurelian,"" the code is said to demonstrate how different ethereum shards may be able to someday communicate on the blockchain.  Stepping back, sharding is an experimental scaling solution touted as a way to alleviate the strain of a growing network by breaking the blockchain up into smaller units, called shards.  While many ethereum developers, including ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, are working toward making sharing a part of ethereum's roadmap, it's still a work in progress (estimated to be released not for another two years).  Speaking to CoinDesk, Zamfir affirmed the proof-of-concept is ""not even close"" to production-ready, but nonetheless he believes it contains code that will be fundamental to its deployment on ethereum.  ""It's really a proof-of-concept of the most core component in my sharding roadmap,"" Zamfir said. ""It prevents the cross-shard atomicity failure, or more specifically, it prevents finalization of cross-shard atomicity failure, so it will never be that a 'send' is finalized and a 'not received' is finalized.""  That likely sounds quite technical, and it is, but put simply, Zamfir and the other developers were able to show how ethereum's native cryptocurrency, ETH, and other messages can be sent securely across a sharded blockchain.  Available on open-source code repository Github, the proof-of-concept comes with a visualizer that allows users to download and stimulate the codebase. Although the current proof-of-work isn't completely finalized, he said.  Zamfir continued:  ""We're still working on the integration but check back in a week and it should be something where we have instructions and you can follow the instructions and get it running on your computer.""  For educational purposes only  While the proof-of-concept was finally written in code at the hackathon, according to Zamfir, much of it had already been developed prior.  ""The specifcation was pretty much already 100 percent done, for the most part. I didn't have to do any research at the hackathon, I was just implementing stuff,"" he told CoinDesk.  The reason for implementing the codebase, Zamfir said, is largely educational.  ""There's a lot of people who can't look at research, especially when we don't have research published in the way that we're really happy with. And so seeing software is something that some people find compelling,"" he said.  Beyond that, though, he continued, the proof-of-concept has ""almost no significance,"" since it didn't look to uncover any new terrain or solve any known problems. What it's missing includes a system for transaction fees and a way to route transactions and messages from one shard to another.  ""We have no real routing protocol,"" Zamfir said, summarizing:  ""All it is doing is demonstrating the cross-shard message passing in the way that it works with the fork choice rule.""  The technicals of sharding  What Zamfir is referring to when he says ""fork choice rule"" is the code for how ethereum shards interact with the main blockchain. This code was released in a proof-of-concept by Buterin in May.  Still, while Zamfir's proof-of-concept builds on the broader body of ideas out there around sharding, it is also built to work alongside his ""correct-by-construction"" research, which includes rules by which blockchains should come to consensus about transaction histories.  ""For me, it's all trying to use the correct-by-construction methodology and all of my sharding stuff is very much squarely within that framework,"" he told CoinDesk.  And with this focus, Zamfir's sharding roadmap deviates slightly from the mainstream ethereum sharding roadmap, fulfilling ""different design criteria,"" he said.  While it's still rooted in the same problems — trying to come up with ways to solve ethereum's scaling hurdles, as well as finalizing the upcoming switch to a more egalitarian way to secure blockchains, named proof-of-stake – Zamfir has a different design focus to others looking at sharding.  ""I consider the core of sharding to be a cross-shard message or a cross-shard consistency problem,"" Zamfir told CoinDesk. ""Vitalik thinks of it as sharding of availability, validity and execution of the state. I have a different perspective than Vitalik does of consensus protocols and therefore also sharding.""  He continued:  ""I'm just focusing on what I think are the hardest problems first.""
