42421210,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXgreP,1633647742,Designer Eric Hu on Generative Butterflies and the Politics of NFTs,"Eric Hu’s design practice has taken many forms. Before pivoting to full-time independent work in 2019, Hu worked at Nike as the brand’s global design director for sportswear. Before that, he was head of design for SSENSE, a Canadian fashion retailer known for its au courant selections and imposing print magazine. Across album covers, magazine spreads and top-to-bottom brand identities, Hu’s work is elegant and composed – even at its most experimental, it’s always grounded in a sense of clarity.  That’s the principle he’s brought to Monarchs, a new collection of visual artworks attached to non-fungible tokens (NFT). Each piece is a twinkling, pointillist interpretation of a butterfly with a randomized set of visual traits.  As with popular NFT projects like Bored Ape Yacht Club or Lazy Lions, minting a Monarch NFT is a little like rolling the dice: You won’t know what you’re getting until you buy in, and the exact combination of traits is different every time. Some wing shapes and body types are rarer than others, and potentially more valuable. It’s what’s known as a “generative” project; the code determines which pieces are assigned which attributes.  Hu priced his NFTs at 0.8 ETH ($2,800) each, and limited initial purchases to one per person. When the full supply of 888 Monarchs sold out yesterday afternoon, Hu and his collaborators came away with around $2.5 million.  “I think yesterday was definitely the most emotional day that I can remember in a long time,” he told CoinDesk on Thursday. There were hiccups – the problem of exclusivity, and a so-called “gas war” that jacked up fees on the Ethereum blockchain – but on the whole, Hu said, the launch exceeded his wildest expectations.  After Bored Ape  Hu got his start in crypto in February, courtesy of Dee Goens, a co-founder of the NFT startup Zora. “He reached out and he just video chatted me, and walked me through just the whole process. I installed MetaMask over video chat in front of him,” he said, referring to the Ethereum wallet software that’s become the bread and butter of the NFT ecosystem. “I think after that process I was really hooked.”  Hu has also spent the last eight months as a member of Friends with Benefits (FWB), the crypto-backed social club that’s now one of the most important (and exclusive) incubators in the NFT space. As a kind of thank you to the community, FWB members were given first dibs on the Monarchs pre-sale.  For Hu, the bridge into NFT art was in some ways a natural extension of the design work he’d already been doing:  “I think a lot in terms of, how do I make, like, modular Lego pieces that other people can rearrange and remix. This generative process where I don’t necessarily know the final results, but I know I could design individual pieces in a way that makes them blend well with other pieces – that’s always been a kind of central telos of my design practice.”  NFTs are just a kind of cryptocurrency – tokens that work as proof of ownership for media files. To mint a file “as an NFT” is just to assign it a token. But Hu said he was more interested in the idea that the code itself could inform the aesthetics of the work. Taking inspiration from Saul Bass’ stippled poster for The Shining, as well as the NFT project Solvency, Hu was aiming for something digital-first, from conception to production.  The smart contract itself, which generated the individual works, was modeled after the code from Bored Ape Yacht Club. It’s a recognizable template – x number of tokens, each tied to a subtle variation on an animal-themed image. Boring Bananas, Weird Whales, Lazy Lions, Cool Cats, and Bad Bunnies are among the most popular, but developers are (still, somehow) coming up with new alliterative NFT collections all the time.  Most of the art behind those projects is garish and cartoony; they’re closer to Beanie Baby-style collectibles than digital artworks that can hold up on their own. Hu was aiming to give this tired trend a fresh coat of paint.  “One of the good things about also just having a programming background, at least in a small sense, is that I’m able to look past a lot of what I call the ‘decoration’ or the aesthetics, and just see the underlying structure,” he said. “And seeing a lot of those Lazy Lions and collectibles, I knew it was a bunch of random body parts mixed together.”  Monarchs is the same basic concept, with an aesthetic informed by Hu’s design background.  The final piece was animation, which came from Hu’s old college friend, the artist Roy Tatum. “When we were first really interested in generative art when we were younger we couldn’t even conceive of something called NFTs, and their use case,” he explained. “It just really felt like this is what we’ve been waiting for for a long time.”  Natural defensiveness  Not everyone in the design and digital art communities sees it that way. There’s still a decent amount of skepticism around NFTs, especially regarding the environmental impact of proof-of-work blockchains like Ethereum. There’s also a political valence to crypto, and though it’s beginning to transcend its Libertarian origins, a certain toxic culture persists.  “I think when a lot of designers look at NFTs, it’s like, OK, there’s new technology, it’s earning a lot of people money. But by the same account, there must be a lot of people not earning a lot of money, or a lot of people having their living affected by it,” said Hu. “There is just this natural defensiveness that comes into it.”  This is what the technologist Mat Dryhurst has called the “Faustian bargain of decentralization,” or of crypto: In a space without regulatory guardrails, there’s as much potential to get screwed over as there is to strike it rich. At least in theory. But when NFT initiates find themselves in a market they’re not prepared to handle, old pros (like the ones in Friends with Benefits) have a chance to capitalize on the hype, and retail investors end up holding the short end of the stick.  “It really is a game of risk tolerance,” said Hu. But any game of risk tolerance only creates conditions of inequality, because not everybody has the same tolerance – or even means – to take such risks. The people who get lucky from taking a risk are able to take larger risks. And people who are not lucky, their ability to take risks is diminishing. So it’s only created even more wealth inequality in the short term.”  Collecting NFTs remains cost prohibitive for most, thanks to sky-high gas fees on the Ethereum network. And $2,800 for a Monarch isn’t exactly pocket change.  Hu says he’s personally getting “about half” of the ~$2.5 million generated by the Monarchs sale. But he’s also holding out hope regarding wealth inequality in crypto, and says he wants to put a percentage of the proceeds toward new NFT projects from underrepresented communities. For Hu, the answer lies with conscientious new voices guiding the technology from its infancy.  “We’ve been pushing that concept for the past decade, that the best way to make our views known about something is to not get involved. We’re boycotting this, we’re canceling this and so on,” he said.  “What you can do is think, OK, how are we going to build these railroads? Who are we going to connect? How is this system going to be more fair? And how can we make a system that works for as many people as possible instead of a few?  “The train’s been invented already. And you cannot un-invent the locomotive engine.”",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/07/designer-eric-hu-on-generative-butterflies-and-the-politics-of-nfts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f61d9ec742186af5e30fc97b4d906293cdb68460-2400x3620.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421033,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXBHaf,1633643891,"Venezuela’s New Digital Bolivar Isn’t Digital, and It Won’t Solve the Country’s Economic Crisis","Ernesto, a gastronomic entrepreneur in Cumaná, a coastal Venezuelan city facing the Caribbean Sea, initially thought that Venezuela’s new digital bolivar — English translation of “bolivar digital” — would be similar to a central bank digital currency.  He even started talking with friends in different crypto chat rooms about the announcement, until he understood that “digital” was just in the name.  “It’s a normal currency, fiat money. They are going to print a bill,” said Ernesto, who preferred to keep his last name anonymous.  The Venezuelan government launched a digital bolivar last Friday, and it is already generating uncertainty and nervousness, several locals told CoinDesk.  The new bolivar appears to be yet another attempt by the government to combat hyperinflation. Last year, according to the local central bank, inflation reached 2,958%, and some would argue that it was even higher.  Now, the digital bolivar consists of a new series of five banknotes and a government-issued coin that replaces the previous currency, the bolivar soberano, which was also known as the sovereign bolivar (English translation of “bolivar soberano”) from which six zeros have been removed. In other words, one digital bolivar is worth the same as 1 million sovereign bolivars.  There are no digital components that make the bolívar digital different from the sovereign bolivars, which could also be transacted electronically, Miguel López, a financial and accounting consulting partner at EY Venezuela, said.  The digital bolivar represents the third removal of zeros from the Venezuelan currency since 2008, when then-President Hugo Chavez removed three zeros from the original bolivar and created the strong bolivar (English translation of “bolivar fuerte”).  In 2018, beset by hyperinflation, Nicolás Maduro, the current president, removed five zeros from the bolivar fuerte and created the sovereign bolivar, which was removed from circulation last week.  According to Lopez, the removal of six zeros seeks to solve a daily problem for companies, public entities and payment systems that face great difficulties in operating with so many digits. Until last week, a kilo of meat alone cost about 33 million bolivars.  The different kinds of enterprise resource planning (ERP) software commonly used by Venezuelan companies don’t support so many bolivars in a traditional transaction – SAP’s ERP software, for example, supports a maximum of 21 digits – and many companies were forced to divide the sale of services into up to 50 invoices, said López, who added that such a large number of numbers also generated confusion when doing calculations.  With the latest attempt to remove zeros, however, the new digital bolivar is introducing other problems. “There is some nervousness about the future of the exchange rate. People are getting rid of the local currency and are desperately looking for dollars to protect their purchasing power,” said Alejandro Castro, a Venezuelan economist and operations manager at consulting firm Econométrica.  In order to adapt to the new currency, the Venezuelan financial system was halted from Sept. 30 until Oct. 4. During that period, the unofficial quotation of the sovereign bolivar was devalued from 4 million per U.S dollar to 5.6 million, because the official market didn’t operate, Ernesto said.  After the system returned, and to calm the waters in the exchange market, the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) injected $50 million into the official exchange market on Monday, which caused the new bolivar to appreciate against the U.S. dollar during the week.  José Guerra, an opposition congressman and economist, wondered in his Twitter account if the BCV will have enough reserves to maintain the current U.S. dollar rate.  “My answer is no,” he said, adding that the BCV is opting to burn the reserves it has to keep the U.S. dollar artificially low. That strategy, he added, could set the stage for a mega-devaluation in the immediate future.  “We’ve already seen that when the dollar has fallen and then risen,” he added.  A digital bolivar, but physical  “In the end, the digital bolivar is digital in name, not in practice,” Castro told CoinDesk.  The term “digital,” Castro added, is due to a future intention of Maduro to digitize transactions and reduce the use of banknotes.  “However, in practice, it is impossible to carry that out, due to a series of local limitations,” said Castro, who added that the banking penetration rate is 50% in the Latin American country.  The penetration rate of smartphones in Venezuela was 38% in 2018, according to a Pew Research Center study, even though locals consulted by CoinDesk said the figure is now 40% to 50%.  The approach of Maduro’s government to a digital currency began with the petro, an oil-backed cryptocurrency that was created in 2017 by his administration, apparently to evade the trade embargoes imposed by the U.S. government.  However, the petro lost its relevance in just three years.  “Even the Venezuelan government doesn’t want anything to do with the petro. It never followed up on it,” Ernesto said, adding that not even government entities use it for payments. Nor do gas stations, which are in private hands but which are closely regulated by the government.  But beyond the failure of the petro, crypto use hasn’t stopped growing in Venezuela, a country that in 2020 recorded the third-highest cryptocurrency usage in the world, according to Chainlink’s Global Crypto Adoption Index.  At his store, Ernesto mainly receives the tether (USDT) stablecoin, although he also accepts bitcoin, dash and bitcoin cash via Binance’s peer-to-peer service, which, he added, has greatly relieved local merchants.  “You get bolivar and convert it to crypto to hedge against inflation,” Ernesto affirmed, adding that he prefers to be paid later in dollars than with bolivars on the spot.  Crypto also grew because of the difficulties to conduct transactions in physical bolivars because high inflation and low denominations of banknotes meant piles of paper had to be carried to make even the smallest purchases.  The impossibility of paying with bolivars also led to the establishment of the U.S. dollar as the unit of reference. According to Castro, Venezuela is a de facto dollarized country, where prices are listed in U.S. dollars.  For smaller merchants, who work in dollars, the only thing that matters is U.S. currency. “For us, the bolivar is practically irrelevant. We pay suppliers in dollars, all prices are dollarized. The only payments in bolivars are basic services, such as water, electricity and telephony,” Ernesto said.  If Ernesto accepts bolivars, he immediately seeks to convert them to dollars through Reverse, a platform that allows the transfer of local money to reserve dollar, a stablecoin that maintains one-to-one parity with the U.S. dollar.  Nevin Freeman, Reserve’s CEO, told CoinDesk that the company went from 10,000 Venezuelan users in March to 50,000 today, while merchants accepting payments with the application went from 4,000 to 6,000.  According to Freeman, Venezuelans first used the platform to transfer money earned abroad to bolivars, but then to save in dollars. Now, they use Reserve directly to make payments without converting money to local currency, he added.  Everything remains the same  At present, the highest-denomination banknote of the digital bolivar is around $20, as opposed to the highest denomination of its predecessor, the sovereign bolivar, which was equal to $0.25, said Ernesto, who added that the change can make transactions easier because fewer banknotes are needed.  Back in 2018, Reuters photographer Carlos Garcia Rawlins showed in pictures the piles and piles of bolivars needed to buy such basic items as a kilo of chicken in Caracas, the capital city.  Angielo, a community manager from the city of Carora who owns cryptocurrencies, said bolivars are used in small towns or territories isolated from cities, such as fields, hamlets or villages, while the U.S dollar dominates transactions in general.  The shortage of physical money generates unusual situations, such as using gold as means of payment. That situation was recorded months ago by a Venezuelan in a supermarket in Bolivar, a state in the eastern part of Venezuela. The bolivar was used to wrap the gold.  Ernesto, for one, isn’t impressed by the government’s new announcement.  “We all already know that it will bring inflation, because in the last reconversions the same thing happened. They worked for a very short time, because the dollar started to increase. The reconversions are useless,” he said.  Eduardo, a data marketing executive in Caracas, said he believes that it is unsustainable to maintain the bolivar as the currency of common use, although he doesn’t think foreign currency will solve the problem, either.  “Without a sufficiently robust economic and legal framework to support these decisions, the government is condemned to repeat the cycle of devaluing the currency even more,” he said.",NEGATIVE,USDT,BCH | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | USDT,Andrés Engler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/07/new-venezuelas-digital-bolivar-isnt-digital-and-it-wont-solve-the-countrys-economic-crisis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8dbde79d645e2a76466fb25169297fbee15df976-4000x2667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396779,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT5HHM,1633641591,New Chainalysis Report Reveals Who’s Leading the World in Crypto Adoption,"Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis’s forthcoming 2021 “Geography of Cryptocurrency” report examines crypto adoption in countries and regions across the world, placing the focus on dynamic trends in emerging markets.  Starting last year, cryptocurrency use around the world grew dramatically, thanks to a crypto-asset price run partly fueled by large inflows of institutional investments into the space. Between January 2020 and January 2021, the number of crypto wallets in use worldwide increased 45% to an estimated 66 million.  In August, Chainalysis published its second-ever global cryptocurrency adoption index, which reported an 880% rise in global crypto adoption, driven by peer-to-peer (P2P) trading and usage in emerging markets such as Africa. The Chainalysis team tracked data across 7,000 crypto service providers and found “meaningful crypto activity” in 158 countries.  Despite the big moves made by institutional investors such as MicroStrategy and Twitter founder Jack Dorsey’s Square in the U.S., Vietnam topped the Chainalysis adoption index, followed by India and Pakistan. Six out of the top 20 countries in the index are African nations.  According to Kim Grauer, head of research at Chainalysis, the research firm took a more targeted approach this year to quantifying the extent of grassroots adoption of cryptocurrencies. Chainalysis used new methodology and metrics to capture this activity.  “There are a lot of extremely large institutional size transfers that really bias our data upward. And so, really, all the things that we did in terms of weights and metrics introduced was to try to capture that day-to-day grassroots activity among your everyday shop owner, or your everyday person who’s accepting a remittance payment rather than capturing those really large transfers,” Grauer said during an explanatory webinar on Thursday.  The report looks to provide more insight into crypto usage in particular regions, noting some interesting trends. For instance, the report shows that Africa is the smallest crypto market in the world, accounting for only 3% of the total market size across regions, but peer-to-peer trading, remittances and savings needs are powering Africa’s grassroots cryptocurrency adoption.  Between June 2020 and July 2021, incoming transfers originating outside Africa accounted for 96% of the total crypto transaction volume in the continent, the report said. It also shows that Africa has the largest proportion of P2P transaction volume (as a percentage of the total regional crypto transaction volume), ahead of other emerging crypto markets such as Latin America and central and southern Asia. Africa also has the largest retail crypto trading market, accounting for 7% of its total market, the report reveals.  Grauer said the estimates provided in the report are probably the best in terms of country-specific cryptocurrency data, but they come with a number of caveats.  “It’s really important to understand the limitations to this methodology,” Grauer said.  The methodology  Chainalysis used three metrics to score countries for the adoption index this year: the total value of crypto received by a country, crypto exchanged by non-professional crypto investors (counting only transactions less than $10,000) and P2P exchange-traded volume.  But all three metrics were weighted by purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita, which measures the ability of an individual in a given country to purchase a set “basket” of goods.  “The higher the ratio of on-chain value received to PPP per capita the higher the ranking, meaning that if two countries had equal cryptocurrency value received, the country with the lower PPP per capita would rank ahead,” according to a Chainalysis blog post on the adoption index.  This brought countries like Vietnam and Kenya, which have significant on-chain crypto activity when compared to their wealth and purchasing power, to the top of the list.  “Vietnam is strong across the board. India is strong in total value received, Pakistan is strong in P2P marketplaces and they’re at the top three of our index,” Grauer said.  According to Grauer, if the team hadn’t weighted each country by PPP per capita, the list would have looked drastically different.  “It would be China and the U.S. at the top of the index, and simply because they have large populations and really high purchasing power,” Grauer said.  It is unclear why crypto activity is seen to be more impressive if the country in question has less individual wealth, considering that crypto can be used for a range of purposes including speculative trading, remittance processing, payments and savings. In Grauer’s own words, Vietnam has a very large professional market while India has an extremely large institutional market.  Meanwhile, to measure P2P activity, Chainalysis monitors all funds going to about 15 different P2P platforms, including LocalBitcoins and Paxful, Grauer said.  “Then we apply our web traffic methodology,” Grauer said, adding that Chainalysis is watching the core wallets – which contain the entire blockchain – of these platforms.  But the web traffic methodology comes with its own caveats, including the fact that web traffic data does not account for Virtual Private Network (VPN) use, which can mask a person’s true location, and that crypto web searches don’t always translate to crypto use, Grauer explained.  She added that not all activity of interest takes place on the blockchain and that you cannot see buy and sell orders on most P2P exchanges, with both these factors being challenges to data collection and analysis.  Hyperinflation  Grauer said Chainalysis also attempted to measure the relationship between crypto adoption and hyperinflation, looking at Venezuela as an example. The inflation rate in Venezuela hit 10 million% at one point during 2019, signaling economic turmoil. Last year, CoinDesk reported that crypto adoption in Venezuela, particularly P2P trading, soared, while the value of the Venezuelan bolivar plunged against the dollar as people looked for ways to safeguard their wealth.  Chainalysis data shows that as the bolivar went down against the U.S. dollar between May 2019 and June 2021, the trading volume on P2P platform LocalBitcoins rose steadily. Grauer acknowledged, however, that this could just be indicating the fact that as the value of the bolivar goes down, it becomes more expensive to buy bitcoin.  “We’re aware of that,” Grauer said.  Grauer added that the team then brought crypto web traffic to the picture and saw that visits to Binance, Binance P2P and LocalBitcoin platforms also rose steadily as the bolivar fell.  Grauer said the researchers also spoke to local Venezuelans.  “They talked about how people in Venezuela are not interested in speculating on cryptocurrency right now. They’re interested in living and surviving, and so they are seeing more people turning to this pretty much out of desperation,” Grauer said.  But 2020 and 2021 have, overall, been a story of crypto adoption in emerging markets and in developing countries, Grauer said, and the Chainalysis index is proof of this.  The full report on the geography of cryptocurrency is due to be released later this month.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/07/new-chainalysis-report-reveals-whos-leading-the-world-in-crypto-adoption,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/25e91031026e1468c8ea2dad8a3f937d627248a0-2031x1477.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396786,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT5HNG,1633639598,Highlights From CoinDesk’s Bitcoin for Advisors 2021,"Crypto assets are here to stay. What began as some niche financial experiment has matured into a retail-driven bona fide market, garnering the interest of financial institutions and professionals alike. Bitcoin, the oldest and most secure crypto asset, has seen its highs and lows, as its price has plummeted and skyrocketed – seemingly all while you grabbed your morning cup of coffee.  On Oct. 6, CoinDesk hosted its second annual Bitcoin for Advisors event to educate financial professionals on all things bitcoin. And while the focus remained bitcoin – hence the name – the conference also dabbled into some of the other parts of the larger crypto ecosystem, giving advisors a new understanding of bitcoin as an asset class and equipping them with the tools to do more research on their own.  Subscribe to Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s new weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it every Thursday.  So why should advisors take a close look at crypto now? Well, according to Onramp Invest’s CEO Tyrone Ross the answer is simple: “If we’re going to see the next great lift in crypto assets, it’s going to come from the registered advisors space … it’s clear institution adoption has come after mass acceptance”.  What bitcoin and digital assets mean for advisors  And Bitcoin for Advisors’ first keynote speaker corroborated this story.  Ric Edelman, the founder of Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, gave a lot of food for thought when discussing bitcoin and what this new digital asset class means for advisors. He made it clear that advisors cannot afford to be left behind and that they need to educate themselves on this new asset class.  Edelman, who is famous for creating the 1% digital allocation strategy for bitcoin and digital assets, went on to demonstrate how getting advisors “off zero” upside far outweighed the potential downside.  He went on to note his support of Gary Gensler’s recent actions as chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, citing Gensler’s experience at MIT and stating, “We finally have adult supervision in the room” (though to be clear, this was not a slight at Gensler’s predecessor). Edelman was appreciative of Gensler’s breadth of experience in crypto and said that he looks forward to the clean-up that’s to come. Notably, Edelman doesn’t see the lack of full regulatory clarity as a reason for advisors to sit on the sidelines, believing that they have enough of a framework to work with.  While Edelman may have been a tough act to follow, all of the speakers brought important insights for advisors. Max Schatzow, a shareholder at the law firm Stark & Stark, broke down compliance and what advisors can and can’t say to their clients, and Morgen Rochard of Origin Wealth Advisers LLC led an excellent discussion on bitcoin and practice management.  Bitcoin’s obstacles and opportunities  At the top of the hour, Bitcoin for Advisors featured financial planning nerd Michael Kitces in a fireside chat with Tyrone Ross, covering bitcoin’s obstacles and opportunities. Kitces isn’t quite completely sold on the bitcoin thesis; he holds a healthy dose of skepticism when it comes to the oldest digital asset in the ecosystem, and for good reason – the “holding” problem advisors have on how to integrate assets into their systems remains. Unless advisors are able to aggregate crypto held by their clients for tracking and reporting, the conversation remains somewhat bleak, Kitces said. Furthermore, he anticipated that advisors’ investments in crypto assets will much more likely happen in the format of an exchange traded fund (ETF) or a separately managed account (SMA) as opposed to trading individual coins, believing advisors to prefer more diversified baskets.  Ross pushed back on the ETF bit, mentioning that fees would be quite expensive, and Kitces conceded that the cost might be prohibitive. And while Kitces remains skeptical about an asset that goes up solely because others are putting money into it, he positions himself and advises others to remain curious and keep an eye out as everything continues to unfold. For one thing, Kitces said he is certain that advisors, whether they hate or love bitcoin, can no longer afford to ignore the asset.  Perspectives on advisor fees and continuing education  Rounding out the end of the day were two of the most recognizable names on the advisor end: Grayscale and Coinbase. (Disclosure: Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.) In a redux of last year’s event, Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein and Lauren Abendschein, Coinbase’s head of U.S. institutional sales, spoke together. From the onset, Sonnenshein came out strongly, saying that fees ought not to be the determining factor on whether an advisor breaks into the space. He noted that the fees will come down over time, but advisors should not let that be the reason they don’t consider bitcoin as part of their portfolio.  Abendschein agreed on the fees, and went on to encourage advisors to continue educating themselves in the space, citing the sophisticated tooling being introduced to the market as an opportunity, as well as catching investors up to speed on the ever-expanding crypto landscape.  Crypto moving forward  And finally, in a closing keynote that can only be described as a history lesson rolled into an optimistic forward-looking take, Dani Fava, Envestnet’s head of strategic development, took advisors down memory lane to a time and place when only a select few institutions were able to trade stocks and how deregulation gave rise to the likes of Charles Schwab. She likened this history lesson to the current situation unfolding before our eyes: Crypto is cutting out the middleman, and if advisors don’t adapt, they will be left behind because their clients will keep building wealth without them.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Stephanie Izquieta,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/07/highlights-from-coindesks-bitcoin-for-advisors-2021,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/49e28aa003647b1dcdc2dc6cdf5a350da6985bc9-5783x3855.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396788,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT5HPE,1633639082,Market Wrap: Analysts Bullish on Bitcoin as Trading Volume Rises,"Bitcoin’s price stayed roughly flat over the past 24 hours, settling at approximately $54,000 as of Thursday afternoon. The muted price action comes after bitcoin rallied an impressive 8% yesterday, driven by concentrated buying. Analysts expect trading volumes to remain elevated, supporting continued upside into Q4.  Blockchain data shows a large buy order was behind the bitcoin rally yesterday. It remains unclear why these large traders (bitcoin whales) purchased on spot exchanges instead of an over-the-counter desk, according to CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen.  However, some analysts remain cautious, pointing to activity in the bitcoin options market.  “We also continue to see bearish-type trades with the spot rally,” according to QCP Capital. “A total of 1,200x BTC end-October BTC calls were sold yesterday, followed by the buying of over 500x of 50/45k end-October put spread today. In the very short term, we might see some corrective price action in BTC.”  A call option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A put option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $53,910, -1.8%  Ether (ETH): $3,598, +0.5%  S&P 500: +0.8%  Gold: $1,755, -0.3%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.573%  Trading volume rise  Bitcoin’s spot trading volume rose over the past few days, which reflects a resurgence of buying activity. The past few months were relatively quiet in crypto markets, although the sell-off in September may have encouraged some buyers who had been on the sidelines.  Blockchain data shows continued BTC accumulation by both long-term and short-term holders who are starting to realize profits above their cost basis, or the original value or purchase price of an asset or investment for tax purposes. Analysts are monitoring the use of leverage, particularly in the bitcoin futures market, to determine if traders are gaining conviction behind the recent rally.  “A spot rally doesn’t mean there’s no leverage,” Delphi Digital, a crypto research firm, wrote in a blog post. “Exchanges also lend stablecoins to their customers, which are then used to purchase spot assets.”  Delphi also noted that a bitcoin rally on high spot volume would “imply that overall leverage is much lower than it would be on a futures-driven move.”  Outside of the spot market, other analysts saw a surge in trading volume in bitcoin’s perpetual futures market, a type of derivative in cryptocurrency markets similar to futures contracts in traditional markets.  “Whales (large traders) bought up BTC in the perpetual futures markets yesterday mostly at Binance, Huobi and Bybit,” wrote Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, in a blog post.  So far, analysts are not too concerned about the sudden rise in trading activity. “Overall, the leverage ratios do not look overextended nor overheated, as we feel investors have been relatively cautious in their trading playbook,” StackFunds, a cryptocurrency investment firm, wrote in a Wednesday newsletter.  Bitcoin resilience into year’s end  Historically, the fourth quarter of the year tends to produce positive returns for bitcoin, which is one reason why some analysts remain optimistic.  October is typically more volatile than September (average annualized volatility of 66% versus 61%), and BTC tends to finish about 13% higher when looking at historical averages, according to data compiled by Kraken.  “This, along with the fact that we saw sentiment rebound late last month following global markets derisking on Evergrande fears and negative headlines out of China, suggests that BTC is arguably becoming more resilient against traditional market turbulence,” Kraken wrote in a research report.  And while further upside is likely this quarter, some analysts expect the possible approval of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission later this month could stall the upside in price over the short term, as has happened after previous important events.  “While we’ve had two down 83% bear markets already, I believe those are a thing of our primordial past – future bear markets will be shallower; the previous two have been -61% and -54%,” Dan Morehead, CEO of crypto investment firm Pantera Capital, in a Thursday newsletter.  Morehead expects a repeat of previous significant crypto events such as the launch of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) bitcoin futures in Dec. 2017, which preceded a downturn in the BTC price.  Still, Pantera maintains a long-term bullish outlook for bitcoin.  Altcoin roundup  Meme coin $SHIB continues October rally: Self-claimed “DOGE killer” shiba inu (SHIB) has pumped by nearly 400% in the past week, pushing the token to the 13th most valued cryptocurrency by market capitalization, reported CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen. Data from blockchain data firm Santiment shows that the number of SHIB transactions worth more than $1 million has been going up dramatically along with the price rally. “I would say it’s just crypto being crypto,” Ashwath Balakrishnan, an associate at crypto analytics firm Delphi Digital, said. “When markets go risk-on, the meme coins tend to benefit.”  Yield Guild Games invests $175K in Merit Circle to expand scholarship program: Yield Guild Games (YGG), a decentralized gaming startup, said it invested $175,000 in Merit Circle to help “bring play-to-earn to the masses,” reported CoinDesk’s Tanzeel Akhtar. YGG said its users can interact with the gaming guild by applying and receiving a scholarship for Axie Infinity or by purchasing Merit Circle’s soon-to-be-released governance token “$MC” to be a part of the DAO.  Automated market maker Tinyman to launch on Algorand: Tinyman, an automated market maker (AMM) on the Algorand blockchain, recently raised $2.5 million and is expected to launch in full on Thursday, reported CoinDesk’s Josh Fineman.

The policy, which will levy a 20% tax on crypto gains of over 2.5 million won (US$2,125) made in a one-year period, was originally supposed to go into effect on Oct. 1, but was delayed due to a lack of taxation infrastructure.  A previous proposal in September by the ruling Democratic Party of South Korea to delay the taxation policy until 2023 was abandoned, CoinDesk Korea reported.  “Any further delay in the already postponed enforcement will lead to the loss of public trust in government policy and undermine stability in the legal system,” Hong said at a parliamentary audit of the Ministry of Economy and Finance in Seoul on Wednesday, according to the report.

42396795,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT5MIG,1633634606,Regulatory Uncertainty a Recurring Theme at London’s Token2049,"Regulatory uncertainty kept coming up at London’s Token2049 conference on Thursday.  Speaking via Zoom, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz said U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler was smart and committed but questioned the scope of the regulator’s purview where crypto is concerned.  “Gensler wants to be the sheriff of crypto, but he doesn’t have full authority because of the newness of our industry,” Novogratz told the crowd in London.  Ascertaining whether crypto becomes a security when it’s lent to someone is a nuanced question, the Galaxy chief said, lamenting a period of continued regulatory uncertainty. However, the crypto industry has brought some of this on itself by a lack of education, according to Novogratz.  “The crypto community at large, myself included, didn’t do a good enough job lobbying domestic politicians, educating them, so they really understand what they’re talking about,” he said.  CBDCs loom  The biggest decision is how stablecoins are approached, Novogratz added, warning against options designed to give central bankers better dashboards and describing himself as a “giant alarm ringer” about centralized stablecoins.  “A central bank–issued currency, I think, quite frankly, will be a disaster,” Novogratz said, referring to central bank digital currencies (CBDC). “Governments are not good at innovating and I don’t think anyone in the West wants to give up as much privacy as the Chinese are willing to give up.”  ‘Going through this pain together’  A morning panel focused on institutional crypto trading echoed the need for clarity.  Michael Moro, CEO of Genesis Trading (which shares a parent company with CoinDesk, Digital Currency Group) pointed to a cloudy regulatory climate being precipitated by U.S. financial supervisors.  “When Chairman Gensler comes out and says most of the tokens that are out there trading are a security but doesn’t name which ones are the securities, that’s more regulator cloudiness,” said Moro.  Where the U.S. is cloudy, Europe is fragmented, added Darren Jordan, managing director of BitGo Europe. “We are all going through this pain together,” he said.  It’s also a common misconception that crypto is unregulated and like the Wild West, said the panelists.  “It feels like being a bank nowadays at times,” said Max Boonen, founder of crypto trading firm B2C2, and a former fixed-income trader at Goldman Sachs.  DeFi focus  The view from those in decentralized finance (DeFi) was that education should be around how aligned smart contracts and regulation really are, according to Stani Kulechov, CEO of lending platform Aave.  “My academic background is as a lawyer and I’ve always thought smart contracts have a killer use case in regtech,” said Kulechov. “The whole ecosystem is auditable every second by anyone.

42394405,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvczfV,1633630674,US Wants to Regulate Stablecoins First,"It’s recently come to light that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Circle, a principal backer of the popular USDC stablecoin. CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson broke the story by combing through filings Circle made in preparation of possibly going public. The scope of the watchdog’s investigation, which began last summer, is unknown. Ironically, though, news of the “investigative subpoena” comes at a time when USDC has never been less risky.  In its latest attestation from accounting firm Grant Thornton, Circle disclosed that it has divested itself of all but a few of its “corporate bonds, long-dated commercial paper, Yankee certificates of deposit and Treasury notes,” economic commentator and CoinDesk columnist J.P. Koning wrote on Twitter. This is part of its plan to have USDC fully backed by U.S. dollars.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The subpoena fits with the SEC’s increasingly aggressive pose set against the cryptocurrency industry. Chairman Gary Gensler has stated bluntly that he believes the vast majority of cryptocurrency businesses fall under his purview. He’s called for crypto exchanges to register with the SEC, and the agency has ratcheted up its enforcement and investigations of all numbers of crypto businesses.  Regulation over stablecoins, now a $130 billion market, is something of a puzzle – and one with a few pieces missing. They are a key component of healthy crypto markets. But many outside observers have raised concerns over the systemic risk stablecoins represent for the larger economy. Gensler on more than one occasion has compared “stable-value coins” to casino chips, with the ability to “undermine traditional banking systems if ... not brought inside the remit of banking.”  To create these fiat-pegged tokens, issuers take in and hold deposits in a process that resembles banking. Another useful analogy might be prepaid gift cards. But the SEC’s top cop has also said stablecoin issuers “could look a lot like a money market fund” depending on how they run their operations. So has Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. So what did the crypto industry create here: digital dollars, securities, commodities?  Politicians including pro-crypto Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) have called for regular audits of stablecoin issuers. A presidential working group is signalling it may create bank-like regulations for the sector. And, as reported by CoinDesk yesterday, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is studying whether certain stablecoins might be eligible for its deposit insurance – which would supply up to $250,000 in protection for token holders should something go awry.  It seems like all signs are pointing for stablecoins issuers to become more integrated into the banking sector, if not become quasi-banks themselves. That’s an arrangement the issuers seem to favor.  Circle is now regulated at the state level as a money transmitter, the same licensing regime for payments companies like PayPal and Square. But it is in the process of applying to become a national crypto bank, putting itself under the remit of the U.S. Federal Reserve, U.S. Treasury Department, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the FDIC. Paxos, another issuer, is also trying to become more bank-like.  “Stablecoins perform a different function than PayPal – so they should probably be regulated differently. Both are used for payments. But stablecoins also get recruited as collateral, or building blocks, for other financial products. This never happens with PayPal balances,” Koning wrote yesterday.  In that sense, stablecoins are a little bit more than money – they’re programmable money! There’s a difference between the tokens themselves and the issuers. It’s all well and good for Circle to become a bank, for the U.S. government to insure its deposits and for greater transparency across the board. But the rules need to be flexible enough so that they don’t crush the utility of the tokens themselves.  Read more: Why Central Bankers Invoke Free Banking to Attack Stablecoins | Nic Carter  The difference between stablecoins and other digital dollars is the blockchain. Tokens like USDC run on the public Ethereum network. “Theoretically anyone with a crypto wallet that hasn’t been blacklisted can receive stablecoins from and send them to other wallets,” CoinDesk’s Nathan DiCamillo noted yesterday. That’s important from a financial inclusion standpoint as well as for the dynamic world of decentralized finance (DeFi), where stablecoins play an important liquidity role.  In some sense, stablecoin regulation – although not yet on the books – is further along than guidance for any other subsector in the crypto industry. The sheer brainpower being directed at defining these tokens and seeing where their issuers fit into the system is impressive. It’s worrisome that Circle has been subpoenaed despite its strides to integrate itself into the financial system.  Wherever the chips may lie after this regulator debate, the outcome will help clarify things across the board for crypto. Nowhere is the intersection between securities, commodities and currencies laws more clear than in stablecoins. Rules around the tokens should reflect that, even if Circle becomes a boring old bank.",NEUTRAL,USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | USDC,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/07/the-us-wants-to-regulate-stablecoins-first,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9d5310bd46bb362e564a6f22f9afe5f9725798a9-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410977,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggttuR,1633629546,"No, Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu Tweet Isn’t Pumping SHIB’s Price","It turns out that the crypto market hasn’t gotten sick of canine-themed meme coins just yet.  Self-claimed “DOGE killer” shiba inu (SHIB) has pumped by nearly 400% in the past week, pushing the token to the No. 13 most valued cryptocurrency by market capitalization, according to data compiled by CoinGecko.  The seemingly odd price pop of one random coin among thousands of others has had some crypto traders scratching their heads: why SHIB and why now?  “I would say it’s just crypto being crypto,” Ashwath Balakrishnan, an associate at crypto analytics firm Delphi Digital, said. “When markets go risk-on, the meme coins tend to benefit.”  Despite a popular narrative that electric car maker Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk may have accidentally pumped the price, blockchain data shows that the seemingly irrational rally may be prompted by moves by SHIB “whales,” who hold large amounts of SHIB, which were followed by retail traders, or the so-called SHIBArmy.  SHIB whales  Data from blockchain data firm Santiment shows that the number of SHIB transactions worth more than $1 million has been going up dramatically along with the price rally.  A wallet-tracking Twitter account also captured a whale purchase of more than 6 trillion SHIB on Sept. 30, just a few days ahead of the skyrocketing price move.  Notably, the increased whale purchases of SHIB also came after India’s Crypto Covid Relief announced on Sept. 23 the conversion of 50 trillion SHIB tokens – donated by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin – into USDC stablecoins has come to an end. London-based crypto market maker Wintermute was responsible for the conversion.  While the whale moves on SHIB may give a glimpse of how the pump may have been triggered, the high amount of whale transactions may not be the best news for SHIBArmy because according to Santiment, it often coincides with a local price top.  Retail craze  On the retail trading side, data provided by blockchain analytics firm Kaiko shows that trading volume across the eight most liquid SHIB/USDT markets all went up on Oct. 4 around 13:00 UTC and 20:00 UTC, and then on Oct. 5 at 14:00 UTC.  According to Clara Medalie, Kaiko’s research lead, trading volume on different exchanges trending in the same direction is common because markets are integrated and overlapping. As a result, the trading data of SHIB/USDT pairs on the eight centralized exchanges cannot give an answer to where and when the pump began.  The conclusion is also supported by data on two trading pairs involving SHIB on a single exchange, Coinbase, according to Dessislava Aubert, a research analyst at Kaiko.  On Coinbase, the average trade size rose for both SHIB/USD (crypto-to-fiat) and SHIB/USDT (crypto-to-crypto) pairs, suggesting that the token’s popularity is built on “a broad client base” from both crypto natives and newbies.  “As a market maker it is much easier to see these flows – for the past week or so we were continuously moving SHIB to Coinbase from other exchanges,” Evgeny Gaevoy, founder and CEO of Wintermute, told CoinDesk.  Pump timeline  While the data does not give an answer to where the pump started, the timeline of the pump shows that the rally may have little to do with Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s tweet about his dog Floki, which was posted on Oct. 4 at 1:41 UTC.  Since SHIB started pumping, there’s been a popular narrative that the tweet by Musk, a billionaire who’s known for his love of dogecoin, has triggered SHIB’s crazy gains.  “I’m not 100% sure what may have triggered [the pump], probably [investors] just got more comfortable once the whole market started to climb,” said Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock.  Chats from SHIB’s Telegram group and Reddit community are filled with messages encouraging readers to buy more SHIB and hold it, with speculations that online brokerage app Robinhood may support the meme coin soon.  A representative from Robinhood said the company had “no comment” on the rumor.  Burn them all  Despite the gain, the token’s price is still down a little from its record high in May after the token was listed on a few major exchanges. With the surging market capitalization of the canine-themed coin, SHIB’s rise also came as its total supply started shrinking.  Besides the tokens that were donated to charities, Buterin had sent more than 410 trillion SHIB to a dead blockchain address, taking them out of circulation.  According to a Medium post by one of the team members, the SHIB project will deploy a number of non-fungible token (NFT) drops in the coming days, which will include a new token-burning mechanism.  Whenever the NFT owner changes the name of one of the 10,000 “Shiboshi” NFTs, $100 worth of SHIB will be burnt.  “If everyone names their Shiboshis that will be a $1 MILLION dollar burn,” the post said.  According to Etherscan, the biggest holder of SHIB is an address marked as “Black Hole” that’s been only receiving SHIB tokens. It is also the address used by Buterin to burn his SHIB tokens.  At press time, there are just around 497 trillion SHIB circulating on the market, according to CoinGecko, with a total token supply of 1 quadrillion.

42421035,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXBHdl,1633624888,What Iceland’s Spectacular Banking Collapse Teaches Us About Tether,"In 2008 and 2009, I was laser-focused on the global financial crisis. It impacted me directly because collapsing state budgets rugged my financial support just as I was finishing graduate school. Thanks to the shenanigans of low-rent mortgage originators and mercenary Wall Street bros, I wound up balancing writing my dissertation with flipping pancakes at a local greasy spoon.  But despite the personal stakes, the immense ramifications of the collapse were impossible to entirely track. One story that felt like little more than a footnote at the time was the collapse of the banking system in the European country of Iceland. There were breathless news reports when the nation’s stock market lost 90% of its value (compared to a 70% drawdown in the U.S.), but at the time the impression was that the Icelandic banks, like so many others, had simply been smashed to bits by the tsunami of unwinding U.S. mortgage instruments.  That, it turns out, was not what happened at all.  Read More: The Pandora Papers Show Why People Love Crypto: You Can’t Trust the Powerful | David Z. Morris  As recounted in thrilling detail in the new book “Iceland’s Secret,” the Icelandic banking scandal was a beast all its own, a whole-cloth fraud that originated a full decade before the financial crisis. When the tide went out, though, it revealed an entire country had been swimming naked. The book’s author, Jared Bibler, had a better-than-front-row seat. An American-born Icelandic citizen, Bibler did time on Wall Street before eventually winding up at Landsbanki, one of the three major Icelandic banks, shortly before the financial crisis.  Bibler opens the book by describing how the rising stock price of the three banks transformed Icelandic life. Just a generation before, the desolate northern island had consisted of isolated clusters of literal sod huts and an economy based mostly on fishing. But the new Iceland, thanks to adventurous international banking, was full of imported SUVs, while Icelanders made regular shopping trips all the way to Boston to make the most of their new riches.  As you might have guessed, it was all a lie.  Bibler saw some of the warning signs during his time at Landsbanki, including dead-end real estate investments, a “spider web of interdependent ownership” on the bank’s balance sheet and extravagant spending that seemed impossible to justify for a bank serving just 350,000 Icelanders. By Bibler’s telling, he eventually listened to his gut and resigned from Landsbanki. It collapsed less than a week later, on Oct. 7, 2008.  Iceland’s other two major banks followed soon after. The banks made up most of the value of the small Icelandic stock market, which most Icelanders were invested in either personally or through government pension plans. Nearly the entire country’s retirement savings were next to wiped out: As bad as things were in America and elsewhere after the crisis, Iceland may have had it worst of all.  Iceland also, the new book makes clear, had it coming. Far from victims of forces beyond their control, Iceland’s bankers, enabled by a neoliberal government, crafted a brazen fraud whose endpoint was practically inevitable. Bibler saw this firsthand: He eventually wound up working at the FME, Iceland’s financial regulator, as part of a team trying to unravel the causes of the collapse.  Read More: How to Talk to Your Legislator About the Crypto Safe Harbor | David Z. Morris  Bibler tells an enthralling tale, walking readers through a financial whodunit full of well-drawn scenes and personalities. I ripped through the first half of this 400-page book the day I got it, unable to put it down. (Bibler also holds off delivering the amazing final findings of his work until well into the book, so if you’d like to take that journey on your own, skip the rest of this review.)  What Bibler and the FME ultimately uncovered is truly gobsmacking. As early as 1998, the three major Icelandic banks were taking huge loans, including from Germany’s Deutschebank and from Credit Suisse. As early as 2003, they were indebted to the tune of €35,000 for every man, woman and child in Iceland.  This was clearly not sustainable, but the executives of the three banks figured out a devilishly simple way to, in essence, take the money and run. Using rich clients and a web of shell companies as fronts, the banks used the capital from big outside loans to buy their own stock, regularly and in large amounts. This earned executives lavish salaries and fat bonuses as the banks’ value appeared to ratchet up steadily.  The mechanics of the fraud also illustrate why some people are so worried about the dollar-pegged stablecoin tether, whose issuer is now in essence a $70 billion investment bank. Tether, the issuing company, has disclosed the mix of assets backing its stablecoin, which includes U.S. Treasury instruments, cash and short-term corporate obligations known as commercial paper. Commercial paper makes up roughly half of the stablecoin’s backing.  Tether has published “attestation reports” of its reserves from an auditor, but never a full formal audit of its backing. Most importantly, Tether has disclosed few details about its commercial paper holdings: We still don’t know what companies or even what regions the instruments come from. Perhaps the most detailed disclosure Tether has ever made was denying that it held debt from a single struggling Chinese firm, Evergrande.  This lack of transparency introduces the possibility that Tether is mimicking the leveraging trick that allowed Iceland’s tiny banks to look massive. The banks would loan funds to outside companies on the condition that those loans were used to buy the bank’s own stock. By sending tether to satellite, unrelated or even fictional firms in exchange for their commercial paper or bonds, Tether would theoretically be able to similarly pump up its balance sheet with pure hot air. (Disclosure: CoinDesk’s parent company, Digital Currency Group, is an investor in Circle, a Tether competitor.)  That kind of maneuvering kept the Icelandic banks’ stock prices going up for nearly a decade, which translated to the sense of wealth shared, for a brief time, by all the Icelanders invested in them. But it inevitably led to pure absurdity. When it collapsed just days after Landisbank, Iceland’s Kaupthing bank had a market capitalization of $80 billion – 30% larger than Enron at the time of its collapse after years of similar fraud. The collapse of the three Icelandic banks together would have been the third largest bankruptcy of all time, behind only Lehman Brothers and Washington Mutual, according to Bibler – and all of it built on a national population the size of a single Manhattan neighborhood.  Something was so clearly out of whack that the British Royal Treasury temporarily declared Iceland and its banks terrorist organizations to protect British clients and investors. It took years for Bibler and his colleagues at FME to unravel the entire mystery, but they ultimately notched some of the biggest wins of the crisis’ aftermath: The heads of the fraudulent banks actually wound up in prison, unlike the leading players on the U.S. side of the crisis.  “Iceland’s Secret” is a treasure trove for those trying to learn more about how such massive frauds are built and, inevitably, collapse – or just for those fascinated with the depths human duplicity can reach. If there is a flaw in the book, it is that Bibler often seems to position himself as the hard-driving, gimlet-eyed American trying to teach the basics of financial fraud to naïve Icelanders.  But there may also be some truth to that depiction. As Bibler details, not just modern banking but even the concept of money itself didn’t arrive in Iceland until after World War II. And the banks’ practices were so normalized among staff that a former insider reviewing Bibler’s meticulous evidence of an elaborate shell game could only respond in confusion: “This is just banking.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | USDT,David Z.

The deal with Merit Circle means the firms can host events and lend assets to each other as well as make investments and pursue projects to benefit both communities.  Merit Circle was incubated by the early-stage venture capital firm Flow Ventures, and has supported gaming communities through its scholarship programs in the Philippines, Venezuela, Africa and Nigeria.  In August, YGG signed a sponsorship deal with cryptocurrency exchange FTX. The agreement will allow Axie Infinity players from developing countries to receive scholarship funds.

It joins a crop of projects seeking to attract decentralized finance (DeFi) users to new chains. Be it Trader Joe on Avalanche or Fantom quickly surpassing $5 billion in locked value, traders are increasingly finding alternatives to the high fees associated with Ethereum-based DeFi.  Tinyman raised its $2.5 million from 20 investors, including Borderless Capital, Arrington Capital and The LAO. Genesis Capital, Digital Currency Group (the parent company of CoinDesk), BlockTower Capital and GoldenTree Asset Management are also investing. The exchange has been operating in testnet, a blockchain used for testing purposes, since August.  The Tinyman investment comes after the Algorand Foundation last month announced it had launched a 150 million ALGO ($300 million) fund to support DeFi projects on the Algorand network.  ”For any of these blockchains ecosystems to exist, there needs to be these core projects that act as a gateway between money and investors,” Tinyman founder Kaan Eryilmaz said in an interview with CoinDesk. “It makes sense to build an AMM for Algorand because there wasn’t one and it desperately needed one.”  Building blocks  Eryilmaz sees governance, smart contract updates, accessibility and an easier interface as the next steps for the Tinyman platform.  “We are a good example of things that can be built on Algorand,” Eryilmaz said. “Tinyman shows that Algorand is growing.”  Operating an AMM on Algorand has clear advantages, according to Ninos Mansor, a partner at Arrington Capital.  “The market can now have ‘fast DeFi’ without caving to centralized blockchains,” Mansor said via Telegram. “Over time, as Algorand captures an institutional capital base, these advantages will enable more sophisticated AMM primitives like novel invariant design.”  Arrington Capital launched a $100 million fund for Algorand-based investments in June.  “We see Tinyman as one of the catalysts for the Alrogrand system to kick off and we see a lot of hype on the VC side,” Eryilmaz said. “There’s a lot of potential for Algorand to grow.”",POSITIVE,ALGO,ALGO | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Josh Fineman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/07/defi-for-the-small-guy-algorand-based-tinyman-raises-25m-ahead-of-dex-launch,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/480f93be99a983bb00f6707c4a0432d25a6a18fb-4192x2358.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It will also include speakers and panel discussions discussing issues related to NFTs’ expanding presence in the art world.  Tezos has also signed on as an Art Basel Miami Beach 2021 partner. This year’s event takes place Dec. 2-4 at Florida’s Miami Beach Convention Center.  “We’re in a new frontier of art,” Mark Soares, CMO and founder of Blokhaus, a spin-off of TQ Tezos and marketing and communications hub for the Tezos network, told CoinDesk. “This experience can bridge two worlds and spotlight great artists sprouted in the blockchain category and bring them to new audiences.”  Tezos NFTs  With its low transaction fees and higher energy efficiency than Ethereum, Tezos has become a popular option for artists and major brands to build their NFT projects. In June, the automotive racing powerhouse McLaren said it would build an NFT platform on the Tezos blockchain. The rapper and singer Doja Cat has been using the music-focused NFT platform OneOf to mint, host and trade NFTs on Tezos.  Art Basel Miami Beach, a nearly two-decades-old offshoot of the original Art Basel in Switzerland, ranks among the world’s most important art events, regularly showcasing new artists and trends. The 2019 event, the last held before the coronavirus pandemic forced the cancellation of 2020’s show, drew over 80,000 people and collectors from 70 countries.

The speakers and panel discussions, which will address such topics as NFT ownership and the development of artistic communities, will be live-streamed.  “This is our way of saying crypto art is here, it’s the real deal, let’s talk about it,” he said.

The coverage comes at a time when Fantom is becoming a popular DeFi “sidechain” – a non-ETH layer 1 sporting faster settlement times, lower fees and often higher-upside, if riskier, yield farms and investments. The chain accounts for $5 billion in total value locked (TVL), per DeFi Llama.  Nansen is a popular tool among traders and yield farmers, allowing users to analyze and often copy the trading activities of well-known wallets. Nansen currently has support for Ethereum and Polygon, and CoinDesk noted that the newly-released Fantom dashboards seem to feature far fewer “labeled” addresses – a sign that team and community analysts have not cast as thorough a net in identifying individuals and funds on the chain, one of Nansen’s best features.  Fantom is among a growing number of layer 1s competing to attract liquidity and DeFi users with massive incentive programs worth hundreds of millions of dollars in tokens. In Fantom’s case, the Fantom Foundation has committed $314 million in tokens for teams that meet certain TVL thresholds.  Read more: Fantom Commits $314M in FTM to Boost Ecosystem Development  In a statement to CoinDesk, Nansen CEO Alex Svanevik praised Fantom’s effort at solving the “trilemma” – a design theory stating that blockchains can only ever optimize for two of decentralization, scalability and security – while noting that the blockchain’s DeFi ecosystem is already showing promising signs of growth.  “It is still early days in Fantom, with just over 30 protocols on the blockchain,” he wrote, “but I am very excited to see what’s to come.”  Ecosystem development  In a report accompanying the new coverage, Nansen’s research team found that Fantom is very much a chain on the rise.  Compared to Ethereum, the number of new contract deployments and transactions per day have been ramping up, with both briefly surpassing those on Ethereum at various points in the last month.  Likewise, the chain has significant quantities of stablecoins – key to ensuring liquidity on a chain – primarily composed of USDT. However, the report did note that “in the later part of September, when the crypto market as a whole experienced a decline, stablecoin activity on Fantom similarly followed the down-trend.”  Perhaps most promising, however, is the growing number of sophisticated addresses labeled by Nansen migrating to the chain. Nansen tags certain addresses that managed to achieve various milestones: the “Flash Boys” label, for instance, is given to addresses that have made multiple decentralized exchange trades in a single transaction that have been profitable.  Nansen’s report notes that Fantom is currently highly popular with Flash Boys – likely arbitrage traders taking advantage of volatility and low fees – as well as “Smart LPs,” or highly successful liquidity providers.  The influx of sophisticated ecosystem players could be a sign of growing adoption of the chain, the Nansen report notes.",POSITIVE,ETH | FTM,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | FTM | MARKET,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/07/analytics-platform-nansen-expands-to-fantom-spotlighting-emerging-defi-ecosystem,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9f517090014a177f0a17dc1941550b4e9f990942-1500x997.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Celsius Network CEO Alex Mashinsky said the company pays an interest rate of 5%-6% to Tether, Bloomberg reported Thursday as part of an investigation into the stablecoin provider’s reserves.  The investigation found that Tether had loaned billions of dollars to crypto companies using bitcoin as collateral.  Tether was the lead investor in Celsius Network’s $30 million funding round in June 2020.  Last month, Celsius Network received a cease-and-desist order from Kentucky’s securities regulator over interest earned on certain crypto accounts. The regulator says the accounts violate the state’s securities laws and fail to disclose to customers what happens to their deposits and whether they are protected under state regulation.  Bloomberg’s investigation also found that Tether’s reserves include billions of dollars of short-term loans to large Chinese firms, something that has been speculated on widely.  In response, Tether described Bloomberg’s investigation as “a one-act play the industry has seen many times before.”  “This article does nothing more than attempt to perpetuate a false and aging story arc about Tether based on innuendo and misinformation, shared by disgruntled individuals with no involvement with or direct knowledge of the business’s operations,” Tether said in a statement. “It’s another tired attempt to undermine a market leader whose track record of innovation, liquidity and success speaks for itself.”  Read more: Tether Asks Court to Block NYAG From Releasing Documents to CoinDesk  UPDATE (OCT. 7, 12:41 UTC) Adds Tether’s investment in Celsius Network in third bullet point.

42396818,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT5MX1,1633603067,Bitcoin’s Options Market Is Now Skewed Bullish Across All Time Frames,"Bitcoin’s options contracts used to hedge spot and futures market exposure are exhibiting bullish sentiment across all time frames in a sign of confidence in the cryptocurrency’s price rally.  The one-week and one-, three- and six-month put-call skews are hovering below zero, indicating calls – or bullish bets – are drawing higher prices than puts, which are bearish bets.  The one-week and one-month metrics have recently flipped bullish, having seen positive values greater than 10% in the past month. Back then, traders sought short-dated downside protection on concerns that the instability in China’s property industry and risk aversion in traditional markets would drag bitcoin lower. However, since Sept. 29, bitcoin has decoupled from the falling stock market.  “When the skew moves from over +10% in the past month to below zero, it indicates a more bullish overall sentiment,” said Luuk Strijers, chief commercial officer at Deribit, the world’s largest crypto options exchange by volume and open interest. “Premiums (the price paid for options) for downward protection are getting cheaper.”  A call option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A put option gives the purchaser the choice to sell. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market, while a put buyer is bearish.  Although short-dated puts drew higher prices than calls in September, the long-dated puts remained relatively cheap, implying continued confidence in long-term price prospects.  Now all four gauges are aligned in favor of the bulls. A closer look at the market activity reveals the call option at the $100,000 strike price has an open interest of more than 12,000 contracts and is the most popular option on Deribit.  Most of the call option open interest is concentrated in strikes well above bitcoin’s current market price.  When the trend is strong, traders often buy these cheap call options like lottery tickets. In the last 24 hours, the November expiry $80,000 call has seen significant volume.  Some traders booked bulls call spreads early this week, according to data shared by Swiss-based analytics platform Laevitas.  The bull call spread involves buying call options below or above the spot market price and selling an equal number of calls with the same expiry at a higher strike price. It’s a limited-risk, limited-reward strategy designed to benefit from an increase in the underlying asset.  The chart above shows that traders have bought December expiry call spreads at $46,000 and $64,000 strikes. The maximum profit is earned if the asset expires at or above the short call’s strike price, which is $64,000 in this case, on the settlement day.  The maximum loss is limited to the net premium paid while setting the strategy. It is arrived at by subtracting the compensation received for selling the $64,000 call from the premium paid for buying the $46,000 call.  The total amount of funds dedicated to bitcoin options has risen to $10 billion, the highest since May, according to Skew.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/07/bitcoins-options-market-is-now-skewed-bullish-across-all-time-frames,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2ff16b536b779908b22376fe557d545ea6628b51-2560x1896.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Buyers also flipped the horizontal resistance at $53,000 into support, the level at which buyers tend to buy, having taken out a significant hurdle at $51,109 earlier in the day. That level marked the widely tracked 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the September sell-off.  “BTC/USD technicals flipped into the bullish territory after breaking above a key trend line,” research boutique Delphi Digital said in its daily analysis, referring to bitcoin and the U.S. dollar. “The move was catalyzed by significant spot buying at the North American open.”  The breakout has exposed highs near $60,000 registered in the first half of May – more so, as the recent bullish move is backed by a pickup in trading volumes and accumulation by whales, the investors with large amounts of the cryptocurrency.  Since Sept. 28, daily cumulative spot trading volume on top-tier exchanges – Binance, FTX and Coinbase – has nearly doubled to $45 billion, Delphi Digital noted.  According to data tracking firm Santiment, whale traders began accumulating coins in late September, kicking off the rally. Those holding between 100 and 10,000 BTC accumulated 70,000 BTC on Sept. 25, the most in a single day for this group since July 2019.

The FSB, an international body charged by the G20 with monitoring and making recommendations regarding the stability of the global financial system, said the implementation of its 10 “recommendations” for regulating stablecoin data safeguards from October 2020 was still at an “early stage.”  “Jurisdictions have taken, or are considering, different approaches towards implementing the recommendations,” the FSB said in a statement Thursday. “To address the risk of regulatory arbitrage and harmful market fragmentation and the greater financial stability risks that could arise were stablecoins to enter the mainstream of the financial system, effective international regulatory cooperation and coordination are critical.”  Recommendations range from vesting relevant authorities with regulatory oversight on global stablecoins to a “comprehensive governance framework” as it relates to cryptos pegged 1:1 to a sovereign fiat currency.  The report also highlighted standard-setting bodies, such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the International Organization of Securities Commissions, which were assessing how existing international standards apply to global stablecoin arrangements, identified a number of “issues” that may not be “fully covered” by ongoing work from countries attempting to regulate stablecoins during a time of increased adoption.  “Ensuring appropriate regulation, supervision and oversight across sectors and jurisdictions will therefore be necessary to prevent any potential gaps and avoid regulatory arbitrage,” FSB said in its report. “Differing regulatory classifications and approaches to stablecoins at jurisdictional level could give rise to the risk of regulatory arbitrage and harmful market fragmentation.”  The FSB also said authorities had identified several issues relating to the implementation of its recommendations that warranted further consideration. Those include conditions for qualifying a stablecoin as a “global stablecoin” as well as investor protection and other requirements for issuers, custodians, and wallet providers relating to global stabelcoins.  Redemption rights, cross-border cooperation and coordination among jurisdictions, and mutual recognition have also been outlined by regulators, the international body said.  A review of its recommendations, in consultation with other global standard-setting bodies, is expected to be completed in July 2023.
