42376951,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vF9j,1394487300,San Francisco Art Fair Takes a Creative Look at Bitcoin,"Fourteen artists showed off bitcoin-inspired works amid music and free refreshments last Thursday 6th March at the Bitcoin Art Fair in San Francisco’s Mission District.  The organisers estimated that between 100 to 150 people attended the show at 20Mission – a “startup living community where programmers, designers, artists and entrepreneurs live, work and play”.  The event was actually part exhibition/part bitcoin meetup. 20Mission hosts a regular get-together for San Francisco’s bitcoiners and, as well as discussing and enjoying the art on display, merchandise was on sale too – with bitcoin swag such as t-shirts, soap and even physical coins on sale.  The gathering  While a DJ mixed old-school hip-hop and electro tunes, bitcoin veterans and complete cryptocurrency newbies alike mingled and enjoyed the art on display.  Ana Muñoz is manager of the 20Mission space and one of the organizers of the fair. Playing artistically with the concept of bitcoin seemed like a good idea, she said:  “Since we are quite involved and interested in bitcoin, we thought it would be fun to run an experiment and see how artists would express bitcoin. Our event was the result.”  The digital currency-themed art pieces were for sale, as well as on view – with set prices on tags placed beside each work. Bitcoin was accepted as payment for those with crypto-coins in their digital wallets, while fiat was also a negotiable instrument.  The event had more of a party atmosphere than that of a regular art exhibition, and unlike most bitcoin meetups, creativity was the focus rather than the digital currency’s technical aspects – with a little bit of merchandizing thrown in too.  Art meets technology  It’s not often that technology gets considered as art. Exceptional autos sometimes make the grade, and perhaps the more iconic Apple products could count, but art and tech often sit on different sides of the creative spectrum.  An argument could be made, however, that the elegant maths behind bitcoin could be considered a work of creative genius.  However, for every Steve Jobs or Satoshi Nakamoto (whoever he is), there is a Bill Gates or Larry Ellison.  The former brought much creativity to their roles in the digital world, while the latter seemed mainly concerned with the financial benefits technology can bring.  The Bitcoin Art Fair brought a refreshingly creative look at normally very technical cryptocurrency concepts.  The organizers of the fair see the bitcoin economy growing, and the themed event gives credence to that.  One artist’s take  Artist Thomas-Joseph Carrieri had a number of pieces on display at the Bitcoin Art Fair.  One of which was based on Mt. Gox, an exchange that Carrieri has been familiar with since its Magic: The Gathering card trading days – the era that inspired one of his his works.  “At first there was some weird looks as if I were trying to make a crack at the situation, but the piece was really talked about at the show and it seemed very positive,” said Carrieri.  While “Mount Gox” did not sell at the fair, Muñoz said that the pieces will stay on the walls for the next month:  “They will be available during our upcoming bitcoin meetups.”  Carrieri's “Playing Pieces” – a display of aluminum-constructed physical bitcoins – did sell at the show.  The artist’s works clearly had a theme that viewed bitcoin within the prism of gaming. His “Holy Trinity” piece, a take on bitcoin and Monopoly, was another work on display at the fair.  “The bitcoin ‘playing pieces’ were inspired by the whole project and the gaming point-of-view that I was going for. I thought it tied the pieces together and shed light on another aspect of ‘place holding’, ‘tokens’, ‘ownership’, etc,” Carrieri said.  The artist believes that inspiration may guide him to create future works within the bitcoin theme. He said:  “If the opportunity arises and I am able to say something new I can definitely see myself involved with both bitcoin and cryptocurrency.”  The 20Mission space  20Mission is the brainchild of Jered Kenna. He was one of the founders of the suspended bitcoin exchange Tradehill, and an early investor in bitcoin.  Kenna is also a regular speaker at bitcoin events, talking about his experiences in the industry. The predictability of past bitcoin events was a likely influence in creating the art fair.  20Mission  is located in San Francisco’s Mission District, which lies near the intersection of 20th and Mission streets. It offers co-working spaces and also living quarters. Although use of either is not mutually exclusive, according to Kenna.  In the time since Tradehill’s operations were suspended due to banking issues, Kenna has been busy. He has started the Money & Tech videocast site, “to cover what the media doesn’t” about bitcoin.  That combination of practicality and inspiration has made 20Mission a hotspot for San Francisco-based cryptocurrency activities.  Regular event  20Mission holds what is considered one of the largest bitcoin meetups in the world. Said Munoz:  “We host the San Francisco bitcoin meetup once a month in collaboration with Andrew Badr and are moving to a biweekly schedule very soon.”  Munoz also says that art shows are going to become a monthly occurrence at 20Mission. “This was our fourth art show and we’ve decided to make it a monthly event,” she said.  Information about upcoming 20Mission events is located on its Meetup page. Munoz says that they are open to additional events being held at the space. She explained:    “We would love to welcome anyone in the bitcoin and digital currency space to reach out and use 20Mission for events.”              Featured Image Artist Works (L-R) 'Quod Me Nutrit Me Destruit' - Thomas-Joseph Carrieri/Sean Vallor, 'Adulari' - Sean Vallor, 'Libertas' - Sean Vallor",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/10/san-francisco-art-fair-takes-a-creative-look-at-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a85926fede9029ebc905cebf7371da6407ad85c-628x417.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376940,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vEzf,1394483646,French Finance Minister Calls for EU Action on Bitcoin Regulation,"France's Minister of Economy and Finance, Pierre Moscovici, issued a call on 4th March for European regulators to collaborate on digital currency regulation as part of an effort to ease the concerns of financial institutions and policymakers.  In statements to the press  , Moscovici has indicated he intends to request that EU member states discuss the matter at the EU Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN), the organisation that sets the EU budget and monitors the financial markets in member states.  Said Moscovici:  “This is an imperative topic to be treated not only at national level but also at European level.""  Moscovici also revealed that his own government agency has been studying the issue for a year through the efforts of an inter-ministerial working group.  The working group is set to disclose its findings in April 2014 in a report that will add to France's contributions to ECOFIN's broader research efforts.  Regulation in France  France has been one of the more active EU nations on matters relating to digital currencies so far in 2014, issuing guidance that bitcoin exchanges need to register before operating domestically on 29th January, and holding Senate hearings on the topic on 15th January.  The 29th January ruling, however, did not regulate all bitcoin activities in France. Delphine Amarzit, a representative of the French Treasury has suggested that digital currency transactions that don't involve fiat money may also need to be examined due to this limitation.  The Bank of France  previously ruled that bitcoin is ""neither legal tender nor a means of payment"", a ruling that is contributing to uncertainty on how regulation in France can go further in regulating the currency. The only ""legal"" currency in France is the euro.  Global impact  The news that the EU may soon issue more guidance is particularly significant given the number of nations that have expressed that they are looking to it for leadership.  For example, the Central Bank of Lithuania told CoinDesk in February it would look to the EU for regulatory guidance, while Greece and Hungary have used past statements by the European Banking Authority to inform its citizens about the risks associated with digital currencies.  As such, any determinations made by ECOFIN as part of the research are likely to have a far-reaching impact on the global community as it seeks to better understand how to put controls on the digital currency.

42376937,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vEvt,1394479312,"Cryptocurrencies are ‘Inevitable’, Says Google’s Jared Cohen","Although Google hasn’t yet made any moves related to digital currencies, the search giant’s Director of Ideas Jared Cohen believes they are here to stay.  Speaking at SXSW – the annual interactive conference and festival held in Austin, Texas – Cohen said it is still unclear how digital currencies will develop, as they are a “pretty new space”, reports TechCrunch.  Jared said the future of digital currencies like bitcoin is clear:  “It’s very obvious to all of us that cryptocurrencies are inevitable.”  No plans... yet  While Google’s entry into the space would be a watershed moment for digital currencies, Jared’s statements should not be interpreted as Google’s endorsement of digital currencies.  Google Ideas is not exactly a skunkworks kind of organisation tasked with developing new projects. It is an interdisciplinary think tank based in New York City and has nothing to do with product development.  Cohen was tapped to head Google Ideas by Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt in 2010 and his statements do carry some weight, though.  Furthermore, although Google Ideas is not tied to Google’s core business, it is still a part of Google’s Business Operations and Strategy group and is not merely a philanthropic endeavour.  However, Cohen has a few ideas concerning cryptocurrencies that won’t go down well with all members of the bitcoin community.  Value in regulation  Cohen sees a lot of value in bitcoin, but he also warns that lack of regulation is a challenge, saying:  “There’s a danger to it not being regulated in some form.”  Cohen added that there is an ongoing debate about bitcoin regulation that will undoubtedly continue as bitcoin “plays out”.  However, it should be noted that the bitcoin regulation debate has been going on for years, but it has yielded very little in the way of realistic proposals, let alone actual regulation.  New Napster?  Cohen also cautioned that bitcoin may be just one model of a practical digital currency – likening it to Napster. We still don’t know how it will develop, he said.  Cohen appears to view bitcoin as a precursor to other digital currencies, but he doesn’t appear to be too certain about it. In the end, he merely repeats the question we are all too familiar with:  “Is bitcoin the model, or the master of cryptocurrencies?”  If bitcoin is merely a model that can be expanded and built upon, alternative digital currencies could be created along similar lines, backed by various organisations, from financial institutions to corporations.  The altcoin craze proves there is plenty of room for development and innovation, but for big players altcoins are not nearly as interesting as bitcoin.  On the other hand, if bitcoin continues to expand unchallenged, any new digital currency hoping to replace it would face an uphill struggle, as bitcoin’s infrastructure grows and matures with time.  The window of opportunity is slowly closing.

42376943,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vF2B,1394476108,eBay Patent Filing for Currency Exchange System Included Bitcoin,"A second eBay patent application has surfaced on the US Patent and Trademark Office database – further highlighting the online marketplace's interest in digital currencies and digital currency processing systems.  Named 'System and Method for Managing Transactions in a Digital Marketplace’, the application follows its ""gift token"" patent revealed on 19th December last year. Filed in December 2011, six months before its gift token filing, this document names bitcoin specifically.  The patent details eBay's plan to create a currency module configured to manage the exchange of digital currencies, one that might require eBay to maintain or access an exchange rate for conversion.  Reads one patent section:  ""The currency module 308 allows a user to trade one form of currency for another form of currency. [...] The digital currency may be used to pay for real-world financial obligations (e.g., bills) as well as for virtual-world obligation.""  The news supports the notion that eBay has been aware of, and thinking strategically about, digital currencies for some time.  eBay currently encourages the sale of virtual currencies on its Classified Ads platforms in the US and the UK, though it permits the sale of such items elsewhere on its site provided they are housed in physical items like hard drives or USB sticks.  Patent lists bitcoin as acceptable currency  The processing system would not be just for bitcoin alone, but rather a long example list of currencies that could be used on the proposed system.  This included US dollars, eBay bucks, now-defunct Facebook credits and bitcoins:  ""A non-exhaustive and example list of currencies capable of being exchanged may include frequent flyer miles, loyalty and reward points (e.g., credit card reward points, hotel loyalty points, retail loyalty points), virtual currency, cash, Bitcoins, Facebook credits, eBay bucks, cash-equivalent currency (e.g., gift cards, travellers checks, cashier's checks), and any other form of currency.""  Payment system 122, as detailed in the filing, would in turn allow bitcoin users to potentially ""accumulate value in a commercial currency"" on the site that would later be redeemed for goods and services on the eBay network.  eBay's bitcoin speculation continues  The patent filing marks the second time in recent weeks that eBay has hinted its broader plans may include digital currencies, and adds to the growing history between the company and the digital currency.  Though he may have been speaking more broadly about digital forms of payment, eBay CEO John Donahoe has indicated as recently as 19th February that PayPal could pursue a digital wallet that holds multiple forms of currency.  Donahoe has been one of the more outspoken executives when it comes to addressing bitcoin. Last November, the exec stated he believes digital currency will become a ""very powerful thing"" that could one day factor into PayPal's plans.

42376936,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vEud,1394472568,"Economist Nouriel Roubini Slams Bitcoin, Calls it a ‘Ponzi Game’","“So Bitcoin isn't a currency. It is [by the way] a Ponzi game and a conduit for criminal/illegal activities. And it isn't safe given hacking of it.”  So said US economist Nouriel Roubini in a spate of heavily critical comments aimed at the cryptocurrency and its advocates via Twitter on Sunday (9th March).  Roubini, who lectures at the Stern School of Business and heads an economic consultancy firm, has earned himself the nickname ‘Dr Doom’ for his often gloomy economic outlooks.  However, he is not a man to be ignored. Roubini famously predicted the US housing market crash of 2006 and the global financial chaos that ensued.  That there are issues to be ironed out with the young digital currency, even its most ardent advocates would agree, but why the economist has chosen this moment for the attack is not clear.  Mt. Gox woes  The bitcoin world is currently recovering from a spate of high-profile company collapses – most notably that of Mt. Gox, once the world’s largest bitcoin exchange.  Mt. Gox recently declared itself bankrupt, citing the loss of around 750,000 of its clients’ bitcoins to hackers. Similar events have also caused the recent closure of the Flexcoin bitcoin ‘bank’.  In his attack, Roubini compared bitcoin unfavourably with fiat currency, and commented on the Mt. Gox affair:    Hacking of credit cards & bank accounts rare & customers fully repaid for it. Who is going to repay the $1bn BTC fraud at Mt.Gox? No one      — Nouriel Roubini (@Nouriel) March 10, 2014    It should be noted that it has yet to be ascertained that any fraud was involved in the Mt. Gox collapse. CEO Mark Karpeles has admitted only to losing bitcoins stored at the company via theft.  Volatility attacked  Another aspect of bitcoin that Roubini singled out for criticism was its price volatility:  Bitcoin isn't a store of value as little wealth is in Bitcoin and no assets in it. Also given price volatility it is a lousy store of value — Nouriel Roubini (@Nouriel) March 9, 2014  He reiterated his concerns over price fluctuations with the comment:  Bitcoin isn't means of payment as few transactions in Bitcoin. And given its volatility all who accept it convert it right back into $/€/¥ – Nouriel Roubini (@Nouriel) March 9, 2014  While the volatility of bitcoin has been a concern, recent events (such as the collapse of Mt. Gox) saw more moderate price movements than might have been expected – a sign, many hoped, of the digital currency’s resilience and growing maturity.  For whatever reason, Roubini does seem to have a bee in his bonnet over bitcoin, and even its advocates are not immune from his attack:    BTCbugs like gold bugs are fanatics who speak of BTC in cult-like religious ways. Like gold bugs they have paranoid conspiracy views on the $      — Nouriel Roubini (@Nouriel) March 9, 2014    Rapid responses  Unsurprisingly, many in the bitcoin sphere are unhappy with Roubini’s remarks. Commenting on Twitter in reply to the economist’s comments, Arturo Villa said:    . @Nouriel Used for criminal activities, Ponzi game, not safe… are you talking about the dollar? (especially under @federalreserve system…)      — Arturo Villa (@ArturoGVilla) March 9, 2014    Miriam Cotton agreed, saying:  @Nouriel Jesus. Disappointing Nouriel. Our financial services and banks have proven themselves 'safe'? Hack proof? #bitcoin — Miriam Cotton (@mediabite) March 9, 2014  A further Roubini tweet stated: “Bitcoin isn’t a store of value as little wealth is in Bitcoin and no assets in it. Also given price volatility it is a lousy store of value.”  Reddit user Beyond_any_therapy replied:  “That’s so funny, because many online retailers accept BTC as payment. It has value to them. So, you’re saying little wealth is in Bitcoin. Last time I checked it was a billion dollar industry.”  Early days  This is not the first time Roubini has criticised bitcoin.  In January, he called it a potential bubble caused by Federal Reserve money printing.  Bitcoin has many notable advocates in the public eye, including Richard Branson, CNBC’s Jim Cramer, and Al Gore, and one US congressman even launched a satirical bid to ban the dollar in response to a senator's attack on the cryptocurrency.  The fact remains, though, that some mainstream economists have been reluctant to support bitcoin.  Bearing in mind that the currency is in its early years as a financial instrument, criticisms of the digital currency may be 10 years too soon. Perhaps the final word is best left to the famous economist Milton Friedman:  “The one thing that’s missing, but that will soon be developed, is a reliable e-cash, a method whereby on the Internet you can transfer funds from A to B, without A knowing B or B knowing A.”  Nouriel Roubini image via lev radin / Shutterstock.com",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/10/economist-nouriel-roubini-slams-bitcoin-calls-it-a-ponzi-game,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/748bb3811df108fe13e02684e390ded6e9ac9f38-667x434.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376929,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vElp,1394469526,Philippines Regulator Issues Warning on Digital Currencies,"Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), the central bank of the Philippines, has issued a warning on bitcoin which echoes similar statements issued by regulators worldwide over the past few months.  BSP acknowledged that digital currencies like bitcoin are ""now being exchanged in the Philippines"" but stressed that they remain a relatively risky investment.  Additionally, it warned that digital currencies and digital currency exchanges are not regulated by national regulators and thus consumers would not be protected from losses if an entity holding digital currencies went under.  No shortage of concerns  BSP pointed out that there is no assurance that any digital currency would be stable or exchangeable. The value can be highly volatile and digital currencies can be used for illicit purposes, it stated.  In terms of consumer advice, the bank outlines ""things to think about before buying, holding or trading"", including: loss of value, theft, lack of consumer protection and the possibility of having assets frozen. The bank stresses that exchange platforms are unregulated and that there is no protection for investors in case of failure:  ""At present, there have already been a number of cases where virtual currency exchange platforms have gone out of business or have failed.""  The risk of theft is real and digital wallets are not entirely safe, while at the same time consumers who purchase goods and services for bitcoin cannot rely on consumer protection regulation in case something goes wrong. Volatility is another concern, as is the fact that nobody can guarantee exchange, it stated.  Lastly the misuse of digital currencies can lead to criminal investigations and asset freezes – even investors who acted in good faith can have their assets frozen as part on a wider investigation (ie in case authorities opt to close an exchange platform).  No immediate effect  Like other regulatory warnings on digital currencies, the BSP statement is unlikely to have much of an effect on the country's bitcoin user base. Although the Philippines isn't bitcoin's biggest community, the country remains a very interesting market for a number of reasons, mainly remittances.  Back in January a team of bitcoin enthusiasts launched BuyBitcoin.ph, an exchange geared toward remittances. With good reason – there are an estimated 2.2 million Filipino expats in Asia and the rest of the world, and their contribution to the local economy is huge.  In 2013 alone they wired more than $13.9bn to the island nation. To put this in perspective, the country's GDP is around $250bn. Eliminating transfer fees in the remittance process could be a boon for many expats and their families back home.

42376931,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vEpb,1394462986,Mt. Gox Files for Chapter 15 US Bankruptcy Protection,"Troubled Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection, an ancillary form of bankruptcy that will complement its primary Tokyo District Court claim issued on 28th February.  US Chapter 15 bankruptcy provides specific protections in cases of cross-border insolvency, and is based on UN model law. Both Japan and the US have adopted Chapter 15 bankruptcy in an effort to better protect the interests of shareholders and maximize the value of debtor assets in cross-border bankruptcies.  At the time of its filing  , Mt. Gox claimed an outstanding debt of ¥6.5bn ($63.6m), and indicated that 850,000 bitcoins had been lost or stolen from its exchange.  This is just the latest development in the ongoing legal case against Mt. Gox. Shortly after its original Japan filing, a US class action suit was mounted by Colorado-based Edelson law firm, which specializes in technology cases. The lawsuit is seeking damages, alleging that Mt. Gox was negligent for failing to provide adequate security to its customers.  Edelson did not respond to comments requesting more information on how this filing could affect its case.  What is Chapter 15 bankruptcy?  Upon qualifying for Chapter 15 protection in the US, certain relief could become available to Mt. Gox, including the granting of an ""automatic stay"" that would prevent creditors from seizing its US assets, though Mt. Gox would have to request such an arrangement in writing. The presiding bankruptcy judge would have the final say on granting the relief.  For more information on Chapter 15 bankruptcy filings, read a full overview here.  Next steps  Following the filing, a recognition hearing will typically be held within 30 days to determine whether the case is a ""foreign main"" or ""foreign non-main"" proceeding, distinctions that would affect the handling of the case. Mt. Gox may not necessarily have protection in the interim period before the hearing.  After the determination is made at the hearing, Mt. Gox would be able to carry out its main purpose in filing, which can include liquidating assets, approving its sale or assigning its leases in the US.  Mt. Gox indicated recently in a post on its website that it planned to restructure and restore the business in order to increase repayments to its creditors.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/10/mt-gox-files-for-chapter-15-us-bankruptcy-protection,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/019f1e3a0a0e846297a7ca95d39f3635ff2a2e51-1000x766.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42374534,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvlGz7,1394456716,Blockchain Rolls Out Bitcoin Payments App for Merchants,"Blockchain.info has launched a new payments app designed specifically for merchants. Blockchain is by far the most popular bitcoin wallet and just two months ago the company reached its one million milestone.  However, its new offering is a very different beast. The Blockchain Merchant app is designed to allow merchants to accept bitcoin payments at practically any retail location. The app integrates with your wallet and it can be set up to receive payments in a few easy steps.  Nic Cary, CEO of Blockchain.info, explained: ""Merchant adoption is something we are very passionate about. We want to build beautiful, simple to use applications for anyone to get started with Bitcoin.""  Easy as 1,2,3  Once the app is installed the user needs to add the receiving address, business name and currency of choice. The user then enters a description and price for items being purchased and the app generates a QR code, allowing the customer to scan it and send the payment.  As Blockchain.info explains:  ""Our goal was to design an app that would make accepting Bitcoin simple and easy for any business owner. Simply download, install and open the app; set up your 4-digit PIN [...]; add your Bitcoin receiving address, name of your business and currency preference; turn push notifications on and then click save.""  How does it compare?  So what are the selling points? Well, since the app is free, they aren't exactly selling points, but Blockchain says it has a number of advantages over traditional payment methods and competing bitcoin solutions.  As soon as it is installed and set up, the app can start receiving bitcoin payments instantly via the Blockchain API. There are no fees on payments and the app is already getting good reviews on Google Play. The biggest complaint coming from early adopters and reviewers appears to be the relatively limited choice of currencies.  The application should run on all Android devices running Android 4.0 or a more recent versions.  Of course, the elephant in the room is Coinbase. The company pioneered bitcoin merchant apps, but truth be told bitcoin merchant apps are still very niche. The Coinbase Merchant app still has fewer than 5,000 downloads, which doesn't sound like much – and it isn't.  Bitcoin POS (point of sale) and mPOS (mobile point of sale) solutions are still few and far between, but in theory they do offer a number of distinct advantages over traditional payment solutions, including the fact that they are free, offer 0% transaction fees and don't require specialized hardware.  Apple is still not allowing bitcoin apps on iOS, which is bad news for many merchants who rely on iOS POS solutions, usually on iPads.  However, Cary has a plan: “We're going to be giving away android tablets as we roll it out around the world. There are already half a dozen on the way to Paris and we'll announce new launch cities over the coming weeks.""

42376938,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vEyP,1394450489,Leading Middle East Music Streaming Service 'Anghami' Embraces Bitcoin,"Anghami, the leading mobile music streaming platform in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) has announced that it will start accepting bitcoin payments.  Anghami  says it is the first music service in the world to accept bitcoin, although a number of smaller music services have announced plans to accept the currency over the past couple of months.  For its part Anghami will start accepting bitcoin subscription fees and incorporate bitcoin into its 'freemium' model. The service is available on all major mobile platforms, including Android, iOS, Windows Phone, Blackberry, as well as Nokia's Asha and Symbian platforms, which are big in the emerging markets.  Alternative payment methods  In addition to bitcoin, Anghami is also using prepaid cards, telecom billing and PayPal, so it is no stranger to the world of alternative payments. However, the company points out that bitcoin offers the lowest transaction fee of all the methods currently available. It has chosen BitPay as its payment processor.  ""Bitcoin is still in its early days – especially in the Middle East. But just like everyone was sceptical that streaming [was] the future of music, we believe that Bitcoin is the future of payments,"" Anghami's co-founder Elie Habib said. ""Moreover, Anghami being a mobile service, paying via your digital bitcoin wallet is a no brainer.""  Fellow co-founder Eddy Maroun pointed out that bitcoin is getting ""major backing"" from entrepreneurs and technologists worldwide. He added that Anghami is sending a message that it believes in bitcoin and that it wants its user base of digital enthusiasts to get on board.  Anghami launched in late 2012 and so far it has managed to attract four million users, mostly from the MENA region.  Bitcoin and digital media – a match made in heaven?  Although bitcoin has received a fair amount of coverage lately, the focus still appears to be on wild price fluctuations, turbulence in the bitcoin ecosystem and various sideshows like the events which unfolded in California last week.  While the attention is focused on headline grabbing stuff, the industry is starting to look seriously into the potential of digital currencies in the content industry. Earlier this year PriceWaterhouseCoopers published a very bullish report on bitcoin's prospects in the entertainment industry.  The Chicago Sun Tribune's bitcoin pseudo-paywall has also attracted a lot of attention from publishers worldwide. In essence, bitcoin's low transaction fees and potential for micropayments have the potential to change the way content is monetized.

42376947,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vF5x,1394446063,'BOOST:Bitcoin' Event Draws a Crowd in Hong Kong,"Over a hundred people, including a large number of absolute beginners, turned up to an event in Hong Kong last week to promote the use of bitcoin for consumers and businesses in daily life.  Co-sponsored by Singapore-based payment processor startup CoinPip, the Hong Kong event, known as RISE:Bitcoin, featured its own mini trading desk (or 'Satoshi Square') to help newcomers set up wallets and make their first transactions with guidance from more experienced users.  Future similar events, like one in Kuala Lumpur near the end of March, will be called BOOST:Bitcoin.  There was also a ""Bitcoin 101” talk for beginners. Helping bring everything together were two local bitcoin community enthusiasts, Jehan Chu and Leonhard A Weese.  Merchants such as pancake maker Mr. Bing and Coffee Alchemy were also there to accept bitcoins, offering both a Hong Kong dollar price and discounted price for people paying with bitcoin.  Growing phenomenon  Bitcoin meetups, Satoshi Squares and information sessions are fairly commonplace these days – with the Silicon Valley and Los Angeles events regularly drawing a large crowd. But the BOOST:Bitcoin meetup was notable for attracting over 100 for perhaps the first time in Asia, and being a special event mainly aimed at novice users.  So what's a Singapore startup doing organizing bitcoin promotions in Hong Kong?  CoinPip co-founder and 'Chief Crypto Enthusiast' Anson Zeall says he ""knows both Hong Kong and Singapore inside and out, but Hong Kong has a way bigger bitcoin market than Singapore does right now, looking at transactions on the exchanges.""  ""Hong Kong has a stronger foothold in understanding bitcoin because of the problems of the pegged Hong Kong dollar/USD. People have been looking for alternatives. And Hong Kong people like to take risk, it's just in their nature.""  ""Unfortunately that startup scene there is not as friendly as Singapore. So working in Singapore, expanding in Hong Kong is the best combination.""  Template for future events  Zeall also said CoinPip now has an event template in place and the company is happy to help out if anyone elsewhere wants to host something similar.  Although his company provided the payment system for the BOOST:Bitcoin event, he said it's not necessary for participating merchants at this event or any future ones to be CoinPip clients, as the company can accept payments and convert to local currency on the spot.  ""The most fulfilling part is buying and spending bitcoins and newcomers that don't have bitcoins will experience what it is like too,"" Zeall said.  CoinPip helps out by suggesting the most suitable types of merchants should be approached for events, what financial logistics are necessary and how the day should be run in general.  Hong Kong bitcoin innovations  The Special Administrative Region of China is shaping up to be a bitcoin hub. Its autonomous government runs a low-tax jurisdiction aimed at easing financial services and attracting startup businesses from around the world, and authorities have also signalled they will not be interfering in bitcoin business.  The very night before the BOOST:Bitcoin event recorded another landmark as local exchange Asia Nexgen (ANXBTC) opened the world's first 'bitcoin shop’.  The 400 square-foot physical outlet has a walk-up counter where users can convert cash to bitcoins face-to-face, on condition they show photo ID and proof of address as Hong Kong residents.
