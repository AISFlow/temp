Benjamin Richman, formerly director of business development and partnerships at bitcoin tech startup Blockstream, joined the La Jolla, Calif.-based bank at the end of last month as director of digital currency.      “We've hired other folks that are from tech companies that were providing services to some crypto companies, and we’ve hired former law enforcement to help us with AML/KYC/BSA, but in the pure crypto space Benjamin might be the first,” Silvergate Chief Executive Alan Lane told CoinDesk.      The hire shows Silvergate’s deepening commitment to serving a niche where most banks fear to tread, owing in part to the high costs of anti-money-laundering, know-your-customer and Bank Secrecy Act compliance Lane mentioned.      At Blockstream, an outfit pursuing bleeding-edge tech improvements for bitcoin, Richman was responsible for the growth of Liquid, a sidechain, or parallel network sometimes used to move money between exchanges.      In his new job, Richman will be in charge of crypto customer growth for Silvergate. He is taking over the duty from the executive vice president of corporate development, Ben Reynolds, who will focus on the bank’s newer initiatives such as crypto-collateralized loans and the bank’s application for a New York trust company license.      Earlier this month, the bank launched the Silvergate Exchange Network’s (SEN) Leverage product, which allows proprietary traders to put up bitcoin as collateral for fiat loans they can then use to buy more bitcoin, similar to margin lending in the traditional markets. The bank also applied for the New York trust license with the aim of providing custody and settlement for crypto.      The bank, which went public on the New York Stock Exchange in November, is one of a handful in the U.S. that will provide accounts to crypto exchanges, startups and traders. (Signature, Metropolitan Commercial and Cross River are among the few others.) Early last year, Silvergate sold its retail branch and business lending team to focus on its specialty business lines, including crypto, a rich source of low-cost deposits.      Richman isn't the first executive to move from Blockstream to a fintech-forward financial institution, however. As CoinDesk reported this week, Jonathan Wilkins, a Blockstream co-founder, is now chief security officer at up-and-coming bitcoin brokerage River Financial.      Richard Bensberg, Blockstream's director of integrations, will be taking over most of Richman’s duties there, a company representative said.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/01/21/in-first-pure-crypto-hire-silvergate-bank-recruits-blockstream-liquid-network-exec,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2c83b306ed4dda688d08db972bd44ecca88e9741-1500x844.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383222,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uZzb,1579640410,3 More Execs Leave Swiss Stock Exchange's $100M Blockchain Project,"Three executives have left SDX, the blockchain-based digital asset trading venue owned by Swiss stock exchange operator SIX Group, since the year began, including two founding team members.      Ivo Sauter, SDX’s head of clients and products, and Sven Roth, its chief digital officer, both left their full-time positions in January. Roth will continue as an external advisor to SDX, a SIX spokesperson said. Both joined from Falcon Private Bank in 2018.      Alex Zinder, an architecture lead at SDX, hired a year ago and based in New York, also left this month, the SIX spokesman said.      Sauter and Roth helped lay the foundation of the SDX project with former CEO Martin Halblaub, who departed last summer.      Reports at that time saying Halblaub’s resignation came down to strategic differences were further borne out by Sauter.      “I think for me, the biggest thing was the initial vision changed,” Sauter told CoinDesk. “Primarily, this was because the mother company took more and more influence on SDX. I believe that with an innovation project like SDX there needs to be a bit of separation from the big mother.”      These comings and goings follow the delay of the go-live date from summer 2019 to late 2020 for SDX, which has been an expensive endeavor for Zurich-based SIX. A source familiar with the project said the cost of SDX has so far reached close to $100 million.      To put the figure in perspective, SIX Group made a profit of about $41 million in 2018, according to its last annual report. SDX has about 50 employees, compared to 3,000 across all of SIX Group.      “We are building something from scratch,” the SIX spokesman said, acknowledging the challenges. “This hasn't been done before and, of course, there are up and downs. And it isn't cheap. We’ve spent quite a few Swiss francs on it already.”    ‘Not my vision’    Sauter said he left on good terms and was happy to have been given the chance to do the work he’d done, but said a growing “dis-alignment” meant he had no desire to have his contract renewed.       “It just was not my vision,” he said. “Believing that this technology just needs to replace the old world one to one, I don't think you need blockchain for that.”      The goals of SDX have become “much more for banks and only for banks,” Sauter said.      The original idea, he said, was to start with banks as a stepping stone and slowly try to widen the circle. “So really using this technology to enable, for example, other startups to provide services around it.”       As well as a shift in the way the technology was to be implemented, the progression towards a more corporate culture also became onerous, Sauter said.       “Obviously, besides the technology, if you change into more of a big-company approach, you have a much bigger overhead in terms of reporting, in terms of risk involvement, in terms of all the corporate departments that want to have an additional report,” he said.     CEO still wanted    Since Halblaub’s departure in August 2019, SDX has been overseen by interim CEO Tomas Kindler, who was expected to take the reins.       However, Kindler has expressed a wish to take a senior position within the main exchange group, said a SIX spokesman.       His decision revolves around the planned integration of Bolsas y Mercados Españoles (BME), the Spanish stock exchange SIX is bidding for.       “Kindler's decision has got nothing to do with SDX and where it is today. He is an expert on post-trade and sees that his quality is mainly there, and especially in the operation that we are doing now in Spain - or intend to do - to integrate their business into ours,” said the spokesman.       Regarding the CEO position at SDX, there is now a short list of three candidates to take over, the spokesman said.

Ever since announcing its fourth round of grants, Gitcoin has been a major subject of conversation across the Twittersphere. In addition to all the excited buzz from both technical projects and media creators vying for grants matched based on E. Glen Weyl and Vitalik Buterin’s quadratic funding model, there has been controversy. Some of that controversy has been from outside the Ethereum community, pointing to Consensys and Ethereum Foundation support as an example of centralization. Some of the controversy has come from within, as debates rage about what is or isn’t an acceptable use of “public” resources.      No matter what one’s position, it’s hard to deny Gitcoin is one of the most interesting experiments in open source funding to date.

42383228,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ua79,1579636808,Vodafone Is the Latest Big Company to Quit Facebook-Founded Libra Association,"British telecom conglomerate Vodafone has become the eighth company to pull out of the Libra Association, the governing council for the Facebook-created global digital currency initiative, CoinDesk has learned.      Vodafone and Libra both confirmed Tuesday the company is no longer part of the consortium. Vodafone will dedicate resources previously intended for Libra to its well-established and successful digital payment service M-Pesa, which the company plans to expand beyond the six African nations currently served.      The parting appears to be amicable, with Vodafone leaving specifically to focus on its own related service and not due to the regulatory concerns that apparently spooked other former members.      Vodafone joins PayPal, Mastercard, Visa, Mercado Pago, eBay, Stripe and Booking Holdings in withdrawing from the controversial stablecoin project, and it is the first company to exit after the association was formally organized in October 2019. The payment companies likely left due to concerns about increased regulatory scrutiny, which several U.S. senators threatened. (At least one, Visa, specifically mentioned “regulatory expectations” as a reason for not joining.)      In a statement, a Vodafone spokesperson said the company believes it can most effectively bring affordable financial services to the world’s poor by focusing on M-Pesa for the moment.      “We have said from the outset that Vodafone’s desire is to make a genuine contribution to extending financial inclusion,” the spokesperson said. “We remain fully committed to that goal.”      Dante Disparte, head of policy and communication with the Libra Association, addressed Vodafone’s decision in a statement.      “Although the makeup of the Association members may change over time, the design of Libra’s governance and technology ensures the Libra payment system will remain resilient,” Disparte said.      Libra intends to admit new members to the Association in 2020, a person familiar with the situation said. The waitlist is currently north of 1,500 companies. A roughly two-thirds majority of existing members must agree to add any new participant.    Door remains open    Facebook unveiled Libra in June 2019, after months of speculation around the project. While the social media giant remains a member of its governing council through its blockchain wallet subsidiary Calibra, on paper Libra is an independent entity.      The Libra stablecoin is intended to serve as a global means of payment, and would be backed by a basket of sovereign currencies including the U.S. dollar, the euro, the British pound and others.      Libra’s goal is to “build a financial ecosystem that can plug in and empower billions of people,” Disparte told CoinDesk in June.      Marketing materials for Libra and Calibra said 1.7 billion individuals worldwide remain closed off from financial services. Libra is hoping to solve this issue by making it easier for individuals to transfer funds from person to person, a goal Vodafone shares.      The telecom has long run its own digital money in Africa through M-Pesa, a mobile platform-based transfer service.      M-Pesa already offers the ability to accept a number of different currencies for remittances. It is possible the platform will accept stablecoins, possibly including Libra, in the future, an individual familiar with Vodafone’s thinking said.      “We will continue to monitor the development of the Libra Association and do not rule out the possibility of future cooperation,” the Vodafone spokesperson said.    2020 launch?    While Libra originally intended to launch in the first half of 2020, this timeline was thrown into doubt last year when Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said regulatory concerns might push back the date.      Speaking on stage at the Blockchain Central panel held by the Global Blockchain Business Council at Davos, Disparte further hinted at a possible delay in the launch schedule.      “We’d rather go slow and get it right, than assign a deadline to launch that keeps us from solving the problem of payments for those who need this solution most,” he told CoinDesk’s Joanne Po.      Regulatory certainty will, however, be needed to help “unlock” digital currencies, he said.      The launch timeline was not a concern for Vodafone, according to the person familiar with the company’s thinking.      Still, these regulatory concerns do not appear to be holding Libra back from technical design and development. The group has already launched a testnet for Libra, with new features added over the past several months.      Last week, Libra announced the formation of a technical steering committee to oversee further development of its roadmap, made up of executives from several Association members.      “The Association is continuing the work to achieve a safe, transparent, and consumer-friendly implementation of the Libra payment system,” Disparte said in his statement Tuesday.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/21/vodafone-is-the-latest-big-company-to-quit-facebook-founded-libra-association,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b6b76a1551aa19106b4c19f3ea5c915e0a3397d3-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383221,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ua0r,1579626000,6 Central Banks Form Digital Currency Use Case Working Group,"Six central banks have formed a working group with the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) to share findings as each investigates potential cases for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).      The group will be comprised of the central banks of Sweden, Canada, Switzerland, the U.K. and Japan, as well as the European Central Bank (ECB) and the BIS. Announced by all seven members Tuesday, each institution will continue assessing the ""economic, functional and technical design choices, including cross-border interoperability"" of CBDCs and will sharing any findings.      The members will also work closely with the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI), an international standard-setter for payments and clearing, and the Financial Stability Board (FSB), a recommendations body for the global financial system, which has previously warned about the potential risks associated with stablecoins.      The working group will be co-chaired by the newly appointed head of BIS' Innovation Hub, Benoît Cœuré, and Jon Cunliffe, the Bank of England's deputy governor and CPMI chair. Senior representatives of other bank members will also be included.      Cœuré took over as head of the Innovation Hub, in part, to lead BIS' efforts in exploring central bank currencies. He previously told reporters in November the ECB was evaluating the future role for CBDCs when he had been a member of the bank's Executive Board. He has also chaired a G7 working group investigating the global impact of stablecoins.      Although broadly supportive of private initiatives in this area, Cœuré famously referred to bitcoin as “the evil spawn of the financial crisis"" in late 2018.      Although Christine Lagarde, then head of the International Monetary Fund, first called on central banks to begin seriously exploring digital currencies in late 2018, interest in CBDCs only really increased following the Libra announcement last summer. Since then, the prospect of a private currency initiative has accelerated central bank research and development into digital currencies.      The central bank of Thailand announced in May it was moving ahead with its own digital currency project. Bank of England (BoE) Governor Mark Carney even suggested a digital currency alternative could replace the U.S. dollar as the global reserve currency. China, which wants to beat Libra to market, is reported to be full steam ahead on its own CBDC.      The new seven-member working group is not the first instance of central bankers working together on distributed ledger technology (DLT). Since 2016, the ECB and the Bank of Japan have worked together to release collaborative research reports investigating how DLT can be integrated into the global financial infrastructure.      The BoE has also trialled various cryptocurrencies initiatives before, but advances in blockchain technology may mean this ""now might be the right time to try again,"" according to Bradley Rice, senior associate at law firm Ashurst.      A perfect storm of global rivalries, the (possible) waning of the U.S. dollar and private alternatives like Libra mean it makes ""perfect sense"" for central banks, like the BoE, to become more proactive in researching digital currencies before it becomes an ""existential crisis,"" he added.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/21/6-central-banks-form-digital-currency-use-case-working-group,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e8a3aadf9ce1f1c40e1b5e81c52637839d3d8c0f-2560x1696.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383219,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uZyL,1579610700,Switzerland Softens Tone on Libra After Ex-President Says Project 'Failed',"The Swiss government has attempted to strike a more conciliatory tone on the Facebook-led Libra project, weeks after the country's now-departed president called the project a failure.      A government memo, seen by Bloomberg, emphasizes the country's regulators have not ruled out the possibility Libra could one day receive their approval. Swiss officials will continue to monitor the project, the memo reads, paying special attention to ""the form which Libra may take in the future.”      Published Jan. 15, the memo could mean the Swiss government wants to soften its stance on Libra and show it recognizes the value of an international payments solution. “Switzerland is generally open to projects that reduce the cost of cross-border payment transactions and seek to promote financial inclusion,” the government said.      The news comes weeks after Swiss Finance Minister Ueli Maurer, who at the time was also the country's president, surprised industry observers with a blunt statement to Swiss broadcaster SRF on Dec. 27, saying regulators would not approve Libra anytime soon.      Maurer stated Libra will not work in its current form because the central banks have not ""accepted"" the basket of currencies that will back the stablecoin. “The project, in this form, has thus failed,"" he said.      Switzerland had initially welcomed the project after the Libra Association said it would establish its headquarters in the country's banking capital of Geneva. As Bloomberg reported at the time, the Swiss State Secretariat for International Finance welcomed the move, describing it as “positive sign that Switzerland can play a role in an ambitious international project.""      The change may, in part, have been a response to international pressure, when regulatory attitudes towards Libra hardened in the months after it was revealed.      U.S. politicians expressed concerns in the summer that Libra would challenge the U.S. dollar's supremacy and harm users with untried and untested technology. In September, France's finance minister said Libra would fundamentally challenge countries' monetary sovereignty and that development should not be authorized in the European Union.      The Libra Association said in September it planned to apply for a license as a payments system in the country. In response, FINMA said the project would likely face strict banking rules on top of tough anti-money laundering controls. FINMA'S CEO later clarified that although Swiss law was non-negotiable, the regulator was not ""here to make such projects impossible"" and would approach the task of regulating Libra with an ""open mind.""      Although Libra had previously committed to a firm June 2020 launch date, Bertrand Perez, managing director of the Libra Association, also said in September it could be pushed back by one or two quarters to ensure regulators are ""fully comfortable with our solutions.""",NEUTRAL,없음,REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/21/switzerland-softens-tone-on-libra-after-ex-president-says-project-failed,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c8db9b5c903c8e0be02d8ecba17bb94bd49bb517-1500x845.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383225,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ua4d,1579608000,Regulated Fintech Firm Monerium to Issue E-Money on Algorand Blockchain,"A regulated European startup plans to bring fiat currency transactions onto the Algorand blockchain.      Iceland-based Monerium, which has a European Economic Area (EEA) e-money license, has entered into a non-exclusive partnership with Algorand. Announced Tuesday, the deal will see the two companies collaborate on developing ""real-world use cases that are enabled by advanced blockchain technology"" using Monerium's ""programmable"" e-money, according to W. Sean Ford, Algorand's COO.      Monerium allows clients to develop blockchain-based financial services, such as cross-border settlements, using any fiat currency of choice such as the euro, pound sterling or U.S. dollar. The firm holds clients' deposits of fiat currency and releases them in digital form for use on a blockchain.      The company said digital fiat currencies can create effective cost savings by removing intermediaries and enabling new complex payment types.      Established in 2016, Monerium made the news when ConsenSys invested in its $2 million seed round in 2019. The e-money license granted by the Icelandic Financial Supervisory Authority in June 2019, allows the firm to operate across the EEA, which includes EU countries as well as Norway and Liechtenstein.      Algorand was unveiled in 2017 as a blockchain with a highly scalable consensus algorithm. The brainchild of celebrated cryptographer Silvio Micali, it has attracted substantial interest from investors, raising more than $60 million in late 2018 and completing a $60 million token sale in just four hours last summer.

42383231,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uaDR,1579604400,Bitcoin Price Indicator Eyes First Bullish Turn Since August,"View  Bitcoin's case for a rally to $10,000 over the next few weeks looks stronger with the weekly MACD histogram about to turn bullish for the first time since August.  Bitcoin is trading in a sideways manner in the $8,460-$8,750 range for the second day. A range breakdown could be followed by a quick slide to $8,200-$8,000.  A range breakout would expose the 200-day average lined up at $9,015.    A widely tracked bitcoin price indicator is about to flash a bullish signal for the first time in five months.      The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram, a technical tool used to gauge trend strength and trend reversals, looks set to cross above zero on the weekly chart next week.      That would be the first positive (bullish) reading since mid-August, as seen below.      A crossover to positive territory is considered a confirmation of bearish-to-bullish trend change. Meanwhile, a crossover below zero is taken as a sign of bearish reversal.      Further, consecutive higher bars above the zero line indicate a strengthening of bullish momentum and back-to-back deeper bars below the zero line indicate a bearish trend is developing.    Bull trap?    Seasoned traders would argue the MACD is a lagging indicator, as it's based on moving averages and the upcoming bullish crossover could end up trapping buyers on the wrong side of the market, as it did in 2018.      The histogram crossed above zero in September 2018, signaling a bullish reversal. That, however, failed to inspire the bulls and the cryptocurrency remained sidelined above $6,000 for the next five weeks before falling sharply to below $5,000 in mid-November.      Essentially, the MACD's bullish cross turned out to be a bull trap.      However, back then, the broader market conditions were bearish. The cryptocurrency had charted a series of lower highs since topping out at $20,000 in December 2017. The situation is quite different so far in 2020.      The sell-off from the July 2019 high of $13,880 ran out of steam near $6,400 in mid-December and the cryptocurrency has been better bid ever since. More importantly, bitcoin broke out of a falling channel two weeks ago, indicating a resumption of the rally from the April 2019 low of $4,100.      Additionally, the historically price-bullish mining reward halving (a bitcoin supply cut) is due in May.      As a result, the MACD’s impending move above the zero could bolster the bullish setup, strengthening the case for a rise to the high of $10,350 reached in October.      As for the next 24 hours, the Jan. 19 low of $8,461 is the level to beat for the bears.    4-hour and daily charts    Bitcoin is trapped in a sideways channel on the four-hour chart.      A move below $8,461 would imply a range breakdown and open the doors for an extension of the pullback from Sunday’s high of $9,188 toward key support at $8,200 and $8,000.      It's worth noting that $8,461 is also the low of the bearish outside-day candle created on Jan. 19. So, a move below that level would validate bullish exhaustion signaled by the candle and invite stronger selling pressure.      On the higher side, acceptance above the channel resistance at $8,750 would shift the focus to $9,000.      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $8,640 on Bitstamp. The global average price, as calculated by CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index, is seen at $8,650.

42383226,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ua5t,1579602921,India's Central Bank Explains in Court Filing Why It Blocked Banks From Using Cryptos,"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the nation's central bank, said it ""ringfenced"" financial institutions from dealing with cryptocurrencies over a range of perceived risks.      In a response to a petition from the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) – which is currently fighting the central bank in the nation's Supreme Court on behalf of companies affected by the RBI's April 2018 order – the RBI said that in restricting bank involvement it had not banned cryptocurrency use generally in India.      The Economic Times said in a report Tuesday it had seen a copy of the 30-page affidavit filed with the court in September and quoted the RBI as stating:      “Firstly, the RBI has not prohibited VCs (virtual currencies) in the country. The RBI has directed the entities regulated by it to not provide services to those persons or entities dealing in or settling VCs. ... The RBI has been able to ringfence the entities regulated by it from being involved in activities that pose reputational and financial risks along with other legal and operational risks.”      The use of cryptos in illicit finance was specifically listed as a concern, with the RBI saying that means of anonymous cross-border transactions ""have to be acted upon swiftly and stringently dealt with.""      The RBI bank ban has greatly affected the local crypto industry, with several popular exchanges – including Koinex and Zebpay – having shut down with no way for users to fund their accounts with fiat currency. Others have attempted to cling on by offering just crypto-to-crypto trading.      More recently, the world's largest exchange by trading volume, Binance, acquired the India-based WazirX exchange. Previously a fiat-free exchange, Binance will enable users to fund their accounts with rupees on its fiat gateway and charge their WazirX accounts using the tether (USDT) stablecoin.      The case against the RBI restrictions is continues before the Supreme Court after months of delays, with the latest hearing to commence Tuesday, according to the Economic Times.      The Economic Times added that the RBI, in its affidavit, said it had had discussions with the government in 2018 over whether cryptos should be regulated or banned. It had proposed that initial coin offerings should be barred, it said, while crypto funds should not be permitted.      It had also suggested payments for crypto purchases should be barred and monitored under amended foreign exchange laws.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | BNB | TOKEN SALE,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/21/indias-central-bank-explains-in-court-filing-why-it-blocked-banks-from-using-cryptos,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/71b54c8a3b7b7503c66d511b99d95de4ccbda096-1500x730.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383232,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uaCB,1579600800,Do Custodians Wield Undue Influence on Crypto Market Prices?,"Noelle Acheson is CoinDesk’s Director of Research and producer of CoinDesk’s Institutional Crypto newsletter. These opinions are her own.      Let’s talk about containers – not the massive cargo ships that cross oceans but vessels such as bottles, boxes and bins. Things that hold stuff. A reliable container does just that, it holds. It doesn’t transform its contents.      In finance, the vessel is the custody service that stores a fund’s assets. A good custody service reliably “holds” securities and bonds in its client’s name, often providing additional services but never influencing the value of the asset.      Cryptocurrency markets are different. Good crypto custody services can have a material impact on an asset’s market price, even going as far as affecting its fundamental value.      This difference is more significant than it may initially seem. In traditional finance, custodians are a key piece of the puzzle but they are not market influencers. In crypto, their strategies – individual or collective – can shape an asset’s success. Yet, this influence is unmonitored and unregulated, and could end up giving birth to an entirely new power structure.    In and out    Let’s look at an example. Crypto asset manager Bitwise, which in 2017 set up one of the sector’s first index funds (the Bitcoin 10 Private Index Fund), revealed in its recent investor letter that it has updated its index methodology.      Previously, for an asset to be eligible for inclusion in the underlying Bitwise 10 Large Cap Crypto Index, it had only to be able to be custodied in cold storage (offline wallets, out of the potential reach of hackers). Now, eligible assets must instead be held by a regulated custodian.      This sounds fair: Custody, especially given the bearer nature of crypto assets, is a complex yet crucial aspect of investment management. With the sector’s endemic security risks, shifting the emphasis to regulated custodians seems like a move towards best practices and greater oversight. All good.      Now, let’s look closer. This rule change triggered a change to the index composition. Monero (XMR) leaves, as the privacy coin is not held by any regulated custodian, to be replaced by chainlink (LINK).      However sensible the index criteria change may seem, here we have custodial practices determining institutional interest in an asset.      Sure, it’s understandable custodians may shy away from privacy coins due to regulatory uncertainty. It’s also understandable institutions prefer professional services over the hassle of self-custody.      But inclusion in or exclusion from leading index funds is likely to have a material impact on an asset’s price outlook. Corporate decisions of market infrastructure participants are playing an important role in this.      Going further, the Bitwise investor newsletter also explains the fund has liquidated its position in cardano (ADA), even though the token qualifies for the index, because it isn’t supported by the fund’s custodian, Coinbase Custody.      Now, it is a fund manager’s prerogative to adjust the composition of funds. But here again is an example of the influence custodians can have on asset prices.      Should Coinbase Custody decide in the near future to support ADA, would it then be included in affected funds? Should this potential, which depends on the decisions of a single custodian, be considered part of the value proposition of ADA?    Up and down    Another example: staking as a service. A growing number of custodians are offering services for tokens that can earn income by participating in governance mechanisms known as “staking,” in which token holders receive compensation for using their position to support the operation of a network. Many clients are attracted by the additional return but prefer to not deal with the complexity of the process, even if that means taking a haircut.      These clients, often institutional, are likely to limit their investment choices to “convenient” staking options – in other words, to the tokens custodians’ staking services choose to support.      Again, custodians shape investors’ choices, which in turn affects the market value of assets.      True, banks today do not offer interest on all types of currency deposits. But the liquidity of foreign exchange markets and the breadth of interest-bearing options elsewhere mean an individual bank’s strategy is unlikely to have a material impact.      Given the youth of crypto markets, however, and the relatively limited range of regulated custodians (for now), institutional investors do not have the same scale of selection. Assets are less resilient to the impact custodians’ choices can have.    All the way through    In traditional markets, large custodians don’t get involved in asset selection. They leave that to investors. Traditional custodians do not have to make calls on which assets to support based on technological considerations. Moving beyond infrastructure considerations, market philosophy has at its root the idea that a supposedly level playing field allows for a fair determination of asset price.      In crypto markets, the playing field is anything but level.      When market infrastructure participants such as custodians have a significant influence on current and potential market values, a new type of power structure emerges.      Going forward, increased competition could lessen the impact. But recently there has been much talk of impending sector consolidation, which could end up having the opposite effect.      This highlights a fundamental shift in the crypto market ethos. Crypto assets were designed to not need centralized custody. Yet, we now have centralized custodians wielding increasing power in the sector’s evolution.      I’m not saying this is bad, nor am I saying it is good. I am saying it is something we should be aware of and keep an eye on. Sprawling systems tend to evolve organically, and it is so easy to wake up one day and realize that it has evolved into a structure with more risk than efficiency.      We’ve seen this before: The decentralization promise of the early internet evolved into a centralized infrastructure with alarming secondary effects because most of us choose convenience over resilience.      We could be in danger of making the same mistake, only this time it is not just our information at risk. This time we’re talking about a market that can shape wealth and move money – a relatively small market for now, yes, but one that is seeping into mainstream portfolios and is likely to end up having a significant impact on finance more broadly.      Convenience is good, as is the sector’s increasing market professionalization and oversight. But you know the saying: “Be careful what you wish for.”      Disclosure: The author owns small amounts of bitcoin and ether.

42383215,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uZs3,1579597200,"Canada Forges $130,000 Development Deal for Steel-Tracking Blockchain","The Canadian government has awarded enterprise blockchain startup Mavennet a procurement contract for the development of an on-chain steel-tracking platform.      Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED), a government agency with the mandate to foster technology innovation, published a procurement award on Nov. 12 that will fund the R&D project for six months with CD$169,427 (about US$130,000).    The goal, as set out by ISED, is for Mavennet to build a blockchain proof-of-concept prototype that can track and share real-time data across the supply chain in the Canadian steel industry, which regularly produces well over 10 million metric tonshttps://www.trade.gov/steel/countries/pdfs/exports-Canada.pdf a year.    Mavennet CEO Patrick Mandic said in an interview that with a blockchain to trace live data points and AI to make those patterns meaningful, the system could have ripples across the multi-billion-dollar industry.      “Ultimately, you’re collecting a lot of data with new levels of granularity,” he said. “If you’re able to collect information in real time and in a way that you can trust, you’re opening up a world of possibilities for analysis and providing insights to the government.”      If Phase 1 proves successful, Mavennet may be able to receive additional two-year government funding of up to CD$800,000 to continue building a deployment-grade system. It's already pursing similar government contracts around the world, including an oil-tracking platform for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.      “The adoption of new digital technology into Canadian industry will help ensure our firms strengthen their competitive advantage,” said Hans Parmar, a media relations manager for ISED.    Tariff concerns    Canada’s steel industry is a major international exporter, especially to the U.S. But that heavy reliance was rocked by President Trump’s 2018 steel tariffs and the ensuing market uncertainty. Last year, exports were down 22 percent.      Mandic said the tariffs provide a context for Canada’s search for a blockchain-based steel supply chain solution. Asserting Trump’s decision was motivated, in part, by fears of tariff dodgers who route their exports through untaxed markets, Mandic said blockchain’s immutability can verify claims of product origin.      “What the blockchain provides is the ability to have a specific set of records in specific points of time,” he said. “You cannot go back in time and change the path.”      ISED’s Parmar refuted the idea that the project was launched in response to the Section 232 steel tariffs. But in a statement to CoinDesk he also explained the platform could have blockchain-specific benefits.      “The technology solution may facilitate trade and domestic policy adjustments, including aligning country of origin marking regimes, certification and labelling if implemented,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/01/21/canada-forges-130000-development-deal-for-steel-tracking-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/515240a5514bd50412f6de3b34b31a1a76c0db96-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
