42404007,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhBkC,1581712226,"For Crypto Miners, Bitcoin's Halving Could Mean a Doubling in Costs","Bitcoin investors speculate the upcoming halving could send prices skyrocketing to $90,000 or higherhttps://www.bayernlb.com/internet/media/ir/downloads_1/bayernlb_research/megatrend_publikationen/megatrend_bitcoins2f_20190930_EN.pdf.    To the operators of high-speed computers used to mine for bitcoin, the halving looks more like a doubling — of costs.      In a new report, the crypto-focused research firm TradeBlock estimates the average cost to mine a single bitcoin (BTC) could jump to $12,525 after the halving, expected in May. That’s nearly double the average cost of $6,851 now. Essentially, miners will have to run twice the number of computations, with a corresponding increase in electricity usage, to get the same amount of bitcoin they’re getting now.      The estimated cost is also well above the current market price of about $10,300, providing an illustration of how the halving could turn the crypto-mining industry’s profitability upside-down if market prices don't rise.      The halving was programmed into bitcoin’s original network programming as a a bulwark against inflation when the cryptocurrency was created just over a decade ago. The idea was a predictable and ever-slowing pace of new supply of the cryptocurrency would help to stabilize bitcoin's purchasing power — a contrast with government-backed currencies that can often be printed at will by human central bankers.      What's happening now is a lesson on the emerging economics of bitcoin’s commodity-like market cycles: Crypto mining companies are scrambling to get ready for the halving by upgrading their fleets of computers to include next-generation processor chips that are faster and more energy-efficient.      Researchers at the U.S. bank JPMorgan Chase have described bitcoin miners’ average cost as the cryptocurrency’s “intrinsic value.” Think of it like oil drillers’ cost to pump an incremental barrel: If a drop in the market price renders oil unprofitable, many drillers will shut off the tap until prices rise again.      TradeBlock’s estimated post-halving cost of $12,525 assumes the network’s current processing power, known as the “hash rate,” stays at its current level. The analysis also assumes an electricity price of 6 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour, which is higher than the roughly 2 cents that some big crypto-mining firms say they can get from the local grid or through wholesale purchasing agreements.      Another quibble-prone assumption is that roughly 30 percent of mining computers will “transition” to the latest technology, while 70 percent “remain on older devices,” according to TradeBlock. Some crypto-industry executives say it's more likely many of the older-generation mining computers or ""rigs"" will become uneconomical after the halving, leaving faster machines to dominate the network.      Whatever the case, the threshold bears monitoring closely for bitcoin investors, says John Todaro, TradeBlock's director of digital currency research.      ""It's very helpful to know what the miners are thinking, what the miners are doing,"" Todaro said in a phone interview. ""There might be some miners that are profitable at those levels, but not a lot of miners are going to be operating at a loss, and they might take their rigs offline.""",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/14/for-crypto-miners-bitcoins-halving-could-mean-a-doubling-in-costs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/56503cdd710dd92cbc7843eb3f0c39e68f762bd2-1500x931.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42404009,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhBn9,1581711358,Hedera’s Token Price Spikes Prematurely After Google Joins the Network's Governing Council,"After Hedera Hashgraph announced Google would be joining its governing council on Tuesday, the price of the network’s native token HBAR rose above 5 cents for the first time since the network’s launch and above 2 cents for the first time in a month.      As part of the body of advisers who oversee software changes for the network and ensure the hashgraph’s decentralization, Google Cloud Platform will run a node and make hashgraph analytics available alongside Google’s other public DLT datasets, Google Cloud developer advocate Allen Day wrote in a blog post. It’s the eleventh member of the council, and joins the likes of IBM, Tata Communications and Nomura Holdings. (To be clear, Google is joining the council, but Google Cloud Platform is running the node and providing analytics.)      However, HBAR holders seem to have been reacting to headlines: The cloud services subsidiary has no plans to further invest in the Hedera network.      Google’s Day told CoinDesk via email that it was “too early to say” what resources the company would provide or what analytics it would make available. (On Wednesday, when Day sent the statement to CoinDesk, HBAR peaked at nearly 7 cents; the token dipped to 5 cents as of press time.)      “We’re not providing material financial support, purchasing Hedera coins or providing any other endorsement of Hedera’s network or currency,” he said.      Google also said it has no plans to use the Hedera Consensus Service, which allows members to plug private networks into the public network. The service launched on Hedera’s mainnet this week.      Rather, Google joined to “provide technical guidance and validate the technology,” Day said. “We are focused on developing solutions that drive real business value across the financial services ecosystem, from capital markets to retail banking and the DLT space.      Google's Day lauded Hedera's speed and “inexpensive transactions with finality,” in a blog post published Tuesday. The hashgraph is smaller than normal blockchains because it does not store all transaction history (though it can be optionally stored on a “mirror” network). Hedera's public testnets and mirror nodes run on Google Cloud.      When Hedera Hashgraph had its mainnet launch in September, 10 of the 39 governing council slots were filled.

So it delivers a better mix of performance, security and determinism.”      Correction (Feb. 14, 20:50): An earlier version of this story incorrectly listed Google Cloud Platform as the entity joining the Hedera governing council.

16284700,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/content-tips-blockchain-ventures,1581710400,Content Creation Tips for Blockchain Ventures,"What are clients looking for in a blockchain venture? Any blockchain startup owner would tell you that it’s, first and foremost, innovative technology. For instance, one of the leading UK blockchain ventures, Edge Network (also known as DADI), drew the attention of the investors with the idea of data decentralization and the necessity to remove centralized centers for data storage and computation. The company perfected its technology with over $2 million in initial investments, and, as of 2018, the company was able to raise over $30 million in investments in just 1 round. But how did DADI manage to achieve such a success and become one of the UK’s leading blockchain ventures? And how do they manage to compete with other similar ventures, like IBM Cloud Virtual Services, CloudStack, or Amazon EC2, which have already entered the UK market? The answer is smart marketing and content marketing, in particular. The blockchain technology market is very competitive. The size of it is expected to reach $23.3 billion by 2023: Image credit: Statista UK investors are getting on the board of this trend as well, as the number of blockchain ventures increases rapidly every year. Last year alone, UK blockchain startups were able to raise more than £200 million from venture capital investors, which is three times bigger than blockchain technology investments in the previous years. However, with fast-growing competition among blockchain technology ventures, the level of innovation is no longer the only thing that venture capital investors are looking for. One of the critical factors is a venture’s approach to marketing. The top venture capital investment companies Andreessen Horowitz and 500 Startups, who together invested over $50 million in blockchain technology startups, mention the venture’s marketing efforts as one of the critical factors in decision-making regarding the investments. So, how should you, as the owner, approach marketing, and content marketing, in particular, to get your venture noticed in the highly competitive blockchain technology market? Before we jump to the content creation and content marketing tips, let’s analyze the general specifics of content marketing for blockchain ventures. How Different Is Content Marketing for Blockchain Ventures? The general understanding of content marketing for blockchain ventures leans more towards the B2B approach. What blockchain ventures usually concentrate on in terms of content creation? “For a blockchain venture, the main focus is establishing authority and providing enough resources for the investors to be informed and make informed decisions,” says Martin Black, a marketing specialist at Studyker. This means that the two main channels that would be the most beneficial content-wise are a blog and community-based social media channels. As for the blog, investors are usually looking for blog content that can educate them about your venture and your technology, provide technical documentation and technology overviews, as well as to educate them about blockchain technology marketing in general. As for the social media channels, not all of them will be a good fit for a blockchain venture. First of all, investors are expecting blockchain ventures to share quick updates and provide additional communication via social media channels, which should be your main focus in content marketing strategy for social media. Now, let’s dive deeper and take a closer look at content creation tips that will work for your blockchain venture. Blogging – Educational Value or News Center? The blog is an anchor of the blockchain venture’s content marketing strategy. This is the primary source to which investors go for the additional information about the product and the venture itself. However, your blog is also the main platform where you can showcase your expertise and build the authority to compete with other blockchain ventures. What content should a good blockchain venture blog contain? With your blog, you can take either of the two main approaches to content – make it a news center or make it an educational portal. Let’s take a look at the examples of each of these approaches. Blog as a News Center Circle, one of the UK’s biggest cryptocurrency ventures, dedicated their blog to the news and updates about their product and its applications as well as company news and articles from CEO. A general overview of the Circle’s blog shows that their content provides consistency in delivering news and reports to their investors, although the activity on their blog is quite low. Nevertheless, having a news center for a blog, you can provide great resources to help your investors learn more about your venture and establish the authority as a strong leader on the market. Here are some blog content ideas for the ventures, who want to run their blog as a news center: updates about the role of the product in the crypto asset trading ecosystem achievements and surpassing milestones acquiring new investors organizing and participating in events reports and news related to the product and venture Blog as an Educational Portal Creating an educational portal is another very common way to treat your blog. For instance, Codezeros, a blockchain venture from India, dedicates its blog solely to posting educational articles, from writing ICO whitepapers to smart contracts and general information about investing in cryptocurrency. Instead of talking about their product and industry news, Codezeros dedicated its blog to providing investors with as much information as possible to help them make an informed decision about putting their money into any blockchain venture. To post news and product updates, Codezeros has a separate page on their website, leaving their blog solely for general blockchain and cryptocurrency education. If you’re up to creating a more educational type of a blog, here are some content ideas you can benefit from: general information on how to read ICO whitepapers correctly general trends in blockchain technology overview of the biggest blockchain ventures and their products tips on wallet development information about coin mining information about smart contracts and their benefits for the investors, etc. If you want your blog to educate investors more about the rules for investing in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, but still want to keep them updated about your product, you can follow Codezeros’ example and keep a newsroom as a separate page on your website. Social Media – Technology Updates and Community Support Now, let’s briefly cover the social media strategy for blockchain ventures. The main task of content creation for social media, in this case, would aim at supporting the community. That is why, when choosing social media platforms for your blockchain ventures, go for those, where it will be easy to support your community and engage your audience. One of these channels is Telegram. For instance, Edge, the UK-based blockchain venture, actively uses Telegram to allow the members of their community to discuss the latest product updates, ask questions, and receive advice. Apart from Telegram, for their social media and content marketing strategy, Edge Network uses Reddit as the platform to support their online communities. Quora is another similar community platform, which you can use to engage your audience. We’ve grown accustomed to seeing the traditional social media platforms – Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter – to be used in a traditional social media strategy. However, these social media platforms don’t always work for blockchain ventures, as these ventures usually a very niche audience. Channels like Telegram and Reddit, however, work perfectly in this case. There, you can upload content that provides your community with quick company and product updates and allows them to discuss the news on the spot. These channels, however, cannot go unmanaged. If you decide to use Telegram or Reddit for your content marketing strategy, make sure that you have a moderator for these communities. You can outsource this task to professionals from such platforms as Subjecto or Writescout, or, if your community is small, you can have your in-house marketing team moderate these channels for you. Word-of-Mouth Marketing – Leveraging Press Releases One of the strategies that blockchain ventures can greatly benefit from in content marketing is press releases. In this case, press releases are pieces of news or news articles that describe the main changes that occur within your blockchain venture. This type of content exists to inform your investors as well as those willing to invest in your venture, about important milestones and achievements, as well as the developments in the technology and the impact they have on their investments. Usually, press releases in the blockchain industry are short (no longer than 300 words) and straightforward. Doing them regularly is a part of word-of-mouth marketing that can not only keep your investors informed but also attract new investors and establish the authority of your venture in the blockchain market. Wrapping Up Will your content marketing strategy be effective? Yes, if you keep it diverse. Since almost all content that blockchain ventures upload to their channels is aimed at a very niche audience, you probably won’t be able to attract more massive audiences with it right away. However, by having regular press releases together with the expert blog and strong communities on social media channels, you will not only grow your online presence but will also attract more high-end investors.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Crypto Daily,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/content-tips-blockchain-ventures,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/16284700.jpeg

IOHK announced Friday its new research and authentication center would form part of UW's Blockchain Research and Development Lab and would promote the company's academic approach to blockchain development and engineering.      The center will feature a new Plutus development facility, providing blockchain developers with an applied laboratory for writing code in cardano's smart-contract language, as well as tools and resources to experiment with new solutions. There will also be a design studio for a new hardware tool that will provide authentication and anti-counterfeiting applications for cardano.      ""This is a very applied laboratory, where instead of doing peer theory, we're actually building real-life things and writing real software that will enter production very quickly,"" IOHK CEO and founder Charles Hoskinson explained in an ask-me-anything session.    Ribbon-cutting    Hoskinson attended the ceremony marking the opening of the research lab at UW's main campus in the city of Laramie on Friday. IOHK's butterfly logo will be added to the research lab, which will be at the center for IOHK's future work with the livestock traceability platform BeefChain, according to Hoskinson.      As part of its collaboration with UW, IOHK has also provided a $500,000 grant in ADA to fund research and development into new blockchain applications, including new traceability tools and supply chain management.      The state of Wyoming is expected to match the dollar value of the grant, meaning UW will receive $1 million worth of initial funding for the new blockchain facility, a university spokesperson confirmed to CoinDesk. The university itself will contribute further supporting funds, though a total dollar amount wasn't shared.      ""The University of Wyoming is proud to be at the forefront of blockchain research and education, and we are grateful for this significant financial contribution from IOHK,"" said UW acting president Neal Theobald. ""This support will help us continue to move forward in a very exciting and promising field of innovation and discovery.""      Wyoming is an attractive destination for U.S.-based cryptocurrency companies that want to take advantage of the state's crypto-friendly legislation that formally recognizes digital assets and provides companies with access to financial services.      ""Our hope is to have a very substantial presence in Wyoming and write a lot of very good software there,"" Hoskinson said.

UW is the fourth academic institution to host an IOHK blockchain lab. The company has centers attached to the University of Edinburgh, the University of Athens and the Tokyo Institute of Technology.

42403997,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhBcK,1581700810,"TON Developers, Investors Back Telegram in SEC Fight","Undeterred by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit against Telegram, developers and investors in the company’s blockchain project have formed a nonprofit for community governance.      One of the TON Community Foundation’s first actions was to defend Telegram in the case, filing a friend of the court brief Friday in the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York.      The brief claims the “community has about 2,000 active participants,” and “the TON Blockchain is fully operational and could be launched on a 5-second notice.” The reason it hasn’t is because the SEC’s lawsuit against Telegram, brought in October, halted the launch of the blockchain, though not the project’s development.      The brief takes aim at the expert report of Brown University professor Maurice Herlihy, earlier submitted by the SEC, which evaluated TON as lacking critical components for a successful launch and not sufficiently secure. The foundation argues that all the elements Herlihy found lacking in TON are not necessary for a launch.      The group was started by Fedor Skuratov, communications manager at TON Labs, the startup formed by TON investors building tools for developers. The foundation’s website went live Thursday night.      The list of participants so far includes 22 people representing their companies, among them TON Labs itself, broker Da Vinci Capital, wallet apps Atomic Wallet and Button Wallet, local communities of investors and developers TON China and TON France, and a number of tech startups. Telegram itself is not listed.      Since October, Telegram has been fighting the SEC’s allegation it had been selling unregistered securities and arguing it’s been building a decentralized system, like bitcoin and ethereum.      The foundation will attempt to make this idea a reality, the group’s declaration says. “Our main mission is to enable the fastest and the most effective development of TON as a decentralized system through collaboration and cooperation.”    Decentralizing    The foundation, helmed by an elected Governing Council, will coordinate the developers, validators, stakers and other members of the community to promote the usage of TON via education, research and development, grants and lobbying, the declaration says.      “I love this project but I always found it a bit centralized at this stage. So when I was given the opportunity to contribute in its decentralization, I was in!” said Philippe Rodriguez, head of the TON France community.      Sergey Prilutsky, head of the tech startup MixBytes and one of the founding members, told CoinDesk his company had “many ideas” about how to use TON, which seemed “promising” as a blockchain. Therefore, MixBytes wants to have a say in how the future blockchain will be developed.      “As developers, we need to know what standards, norms, security criteria, tools and documents will be adopted and take part in the decision making process,” Prilutsky said.      “We’ve been in the ethereum community for a few years and we believe such associations are crucial at the early stages of such projects’ lives, which is the first ten years,” said Nick Kozlov, co-founder and CTO of Button Wallet.    White paper scraps    To be clear, the foundation spearheaded by TON Labs has almost nothing to do with the TON Foundation described in the original TON white paper.      In fact, the concept described in the white paper might never be created by Telegram as it was supposed to manage the supply of the native gram tokens. This became a dangerous area for the company as it’s trying to convince the court it’s building a decentralized system, and therefore its native token, gram, is not a security.      According to the white paper, after the TON blockchain is launched and the investors get their allocations, every subsequent token should be sold by an entity named TON Reserve, which, in turn, would be controlled by the TON Foundation.      The TON Foundation was also expected “to provide most of the validators during the first deployment phase of the TON Blockchain”, decide on protocol changes, and have a majority of votes during the first months of TON’s existence.      “Later, when less than half of all grams remain under control of the TON Foundation, the system will become more democratic,” the white paper said.    The right moment    Then, apparently, the court battle made the need for “democratization” more urgent.      In January, Telegram issued a “public notice” saying it was ""under no obligation"" to establish the TON Foundation. The notice also said the wallet for grams will not be built into Telegram’s flagship product, the popular messenger app, at least not at the moment of the launch.      The wallet app for the testnet, which has been live since last March, was released in November. Earlier in February, Telegram published a technical paper describing the TON consensus protocol, dubbed Catchain.      Although nothing in the new foundation’s declaration mentions the SEC’s lawsuit, the community apparently wants to help TON progress even if Telegram’s hands are tied.      Being more community driven will help the project succeed, said Sergey Vasylchuk, the CEO of tech startup Everstake, which is a validator in networks such as EOS and Tezos      “We wouldn’t like to see this project [become] a lawyer’s hostage. We saw that happening to Block.One, which has a great team and implementation but its hands are tied by the legal issues,” Vasylchuk said.      Skuratov acknowledged the timing of the foundation’s launch was set by the court timeline. The first hearing on the case is scheduled for Feb. 19.      But “the community has already reached the point when it’s time,” he said.    SEC responds    On Feb. 18, the SEC asked the court to bar the TON Community Foundation from submitting its brief, calling the nonprofit's claims ""unsworn, unattributed and unverified.""      The agency also said that some participants in the foundation have an interest in the litigation's outcome. Specifically, ""one of the owners of TON Labs, Alexander Filatov is an indirect investor in approximately $95 million of Grams,” and “Mr. Jelezko and DaVinci entered into purchase agreements with Telegram totaling $72 million.”      Skuratov called the SEC's argument ""meaningless, as it is obvious that the TCF has been created and attracts those who interested in developing TON, including employees of companies that link their future with TON.""      Filatov told CoinDesk he didn't invest. Da Vinci Capital didn't respond to a request for comment by press time.      In any event, Judge P. Kevin Castel asked the foundation for an affidavit with more detail about the organization and the people behind it.

42374490,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZzpF,1581694391,"Polychain Capital Targets $200M for Second Venture Fund, Slide Deck Reveals","Cryptocurrency investment firm Polychain Capital is raising $200 million for a second fund aimed at venture investing, a funding goal that would top its first venture fund by $25 million.  According to an investor slide deck obtained by CoinDesk, the second venture fund opened at the beginning of 2020 and is accepting minimum investments of $1 million for up to three years. Like Polychain Capital’s first venture fund, the new money will back early-stage crypto startups raising pre-seed, seed and Series A funding rounds.  The first venture fund, which raised $175 million from investors who cut checks normally between $500,000 and $5 million, invested most of its capital by the end of last year after launching in the first quarter of 2018, according to the Polychain slide deck. The capital, the deck says, was split 40 percent to startups that improved on existing blockchain infrastructure and 60 percent to startups that explored less-tested industry concepts.  The second venture fund was registered in December of last year, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) documents. The deck does not indicate the amount Polychain Capital has raised for the second venture fund. Polychain Capital declined to comment on funding progress and specifics due to investor restrictions.  Blockchain networks with enhanced privacy, engineering and flexibility will be prioritized in the second venture fund, the deck says, piggybacking on existing investments in cloud platform Dfinity and blockchain interoperability projects Cosmos and Polkadot.  With its first fund, Polychain says it sought exposure to cryptocurrency exchanges and custodians through the investments that were considered foundational to the industry, a strategy that homes in on Polychain’s banner investment, Coinbase, the San Francisco-based crypto exchange and tech unicorn.  More novel investments in the flagship venture portfolio, meanwhile, trended toward decentralized financial entities – digitized financial instruments and brokers that self-regulate themselves and avoid manual oversight while often settling in crypto. So far, Polychain has backed decentralized finance (DeFi) powerhouse MakerDAO, margin trading book dYdX, blockchain bank Dharma and lending protocol Compound, among others.  Venture trajectory  To date, none of Polychain Capital’s reported venture fund investments has issued a public offering or been acquired. Such exits traditionally allow a fund to cash out its holdings in a portfolio company and deliver sizable returns to fund investors.  Investors in Polychain Capital, or limited partners, have reportedly counted technology venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, Founders Fund and Union Square Ventures – some of which have co-invested in Polychain portfolio companies.  SEC filings show that assets across all Polychain Capital funds dipped from $967.8 million in August 2018 to $595.1 million in March 2019. The total assets accounted for cryptocurrencies, equity in company investments and unspent investor money as valued at the time the disclosure forms were filed.  Of those funds, Polychain Capital claims in the new investor deck that its cryptocurrency asset fund – a hedge fund launched in 2016 that trades short-term and long-term positions of digital assets – manages some $550 million. The deck, which appears to have been produced in or after October 2019, notes that the hedge fund is simultaneously taking investments north of $1 million on a rolling basis.  An early pioneer in the crypto VC space, Polychain Capital was founded in San Francisco by Olaf Carlson-Wee, the first employee and former head of risk at Coinbase. Polychain CTO Rob Witoff and Polychain partners Sam Rosenblum and Aurora Harshner are also alumni of Coinbase.  Polychain Capital's two executive partners aside from Carlson-Wee and Witoff – President Joe Eagan and joint COO-CFO Matt Perona – hail from traditional finance backgrounds. Perona was CFO of Criterion Capital from 2015 to 2018. Eagan was previously COO of Tiger Legatus, a consumer stock hedge fund.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Ada Hui,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/14/polychain-capital-targets-200m-for-second-venture-fund-slide-deck-reveals,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/77f594ffa2d594865db31524f3512e0e6b54b1b8-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a results call for H1 2020 Thursday, reported by ZDNet, ASX CEO Dominic Stevens said: ""We're very excited about the long-term benefits this can bring to clearing and settlement specifically, and to the efficiency of the securities industry in Australia generally,"" Stevens said.      Specifically, Stevens was discussing the ASX's development of a blockchain-based replacement for its now-aging clearing system called CHESS. Work has been ongoing for several years in partnership with U.S. firm Digital Asset (DA), which is working on the blockchain underpinnings of the platform.      According to ZDNet, industry testing is now set for July 2020. DA said that process was expected to take about a year when it received backing from the ASX in its $35 million in Series C financing in December 2019.      According to Stevens, the opportunities the digital ledgers bring to securities clearing are ""being recognized by customers and third parties and these opportunities are developing in a range of areas including risk management and process automation.""      With ASX taking an early lead when it comes to rebuilding with blockchain, other industry players have been seeking assistance from the bourse, its CEO said. However, while that potentially offers the firm new business options, it's leaving that option for further down the road as the primary business is ""very, very strong.""      Indeed, in its results call, the ASX disclosed an AU$250 million (US$68 million) after-tax profit from revenue of AU$546 million (US$367), as per an earlier ZDNet report.      Aside from its DLT work, ASX is looking at other new technologies to redesign itself for the digital age. ""We're actually transforming our entire technology stack from the operational databases and communications infrastructure we use to the way we deploy distributed ledger, cloud, big data, AI tools,"" said Stevens.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/14/asx-sees-industry-benefits-arising-from-blockchain-upgrade-as-july-tests-approach,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9203e1f4ee066f444e097b6a0d606773f649901e-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

MakerDAO announced Thursday Coinbase Commerce had integrated dai as a payment method, opening the cryptocurrency up to affiliated online merchants and online commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce.      The integration will introduce ""merchants to a growing segment of the cryptocurrency market, allowing them to bridge the gap between DeFi dapp entrepreneurs and their own “real world” businesses,"" according to the blog post.      Coinbase Commerce is a free-to-use service for online retailers, allowing them to integrate cryptocurrency into their businesses. Starting out with bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), bitcoin cash (BCH) and litecoin (LTC), the platform has only added support for USDC – the stablecoin created by Circle and Coinbase as part of the CENTRE consortium – since its February 2018 launch.      CoinDesk has approached Coinbase for comment and will update this article if we hear back.      With the new integration, merchants will also be able to earn interest on any received dai by transferring it into a Dai Savings Rate (DSR) smart contract on the maker protocol. The DSR interest rate was raised to 7.5 percent by community vote earlier in February.      MakerDAO says the integration will boost perceptions of dai and, potentially, bring increased adoption.      Currently, 435,000 ether (worth roughly US $117.4 million) have been locked up in dai ""vaults,"" down more than 75 percent since its all-time high in November, according to statistics site MKR Tools. Maker's vaults create dai as users commit collateral assets into them.

42431554,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN3Ljh,1581685211,OKEx Partners With Bain-Backed Crypto Exchange to Launch Leveraged Futures in India,"An Indian cryptocurrency exchange has partnered with Malta-based trading platform OKEx to offer futures products specifically for the subcontinent market.      Mumbai-based CoinDCX announced Friday the strategic partnership will help it develop a new derivative facility – known as DCXfutures – in return for providing OKEx with a foothold in the Indian market.      Using CoinDCX's new derivatives facility, Indian investors will be able to trade futures, with leverage of up to 15x provided by OKEx on nine cryptocurrencies including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), XRP (XRP) and litecoin (LTC). Available to both institutional and retail investors, the platform will also offer perpetual futures contracts in both bitcoin and ether.      The partnership with CoinDCX – which is backed by an undisclosed amount from investors including Bain Capital – provides OKEx with insight, liquidity and connectivity to the rebounding Indian cryptocurrency scene, according to the announcement.      During the 2017 initial coin offering boom, five million Indians were estimated to be trading digital currencies, but in April 2018 the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the country's central bank, ordered financial institutions to stop dealing with any firms involved in crypto trading in 2018, greatly restricting the market.      Local exchange Koinex was forced to close its doors last summer, claiming the RBI ban had made it economically unfeasible for them to operate as a business. Zebpay, which used to be the largest exchange in India, complained the ban had ""crippled"" its ability to offer crypto trading services. Some, however, have soldiered on, offering crypto-to-crypto trading only.      In the coming weeks, the country's Supreme Court is expected to rule on whether the RBI acted outside its jurisdiction when it issued the banking ban.

42431552,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN3Lfh,1581681600,Blockchain Bills Are Advancing in the New York State Senate – Here's Why,"ALBANY, N.Y. — The New York State Senate will be considering two bills that would bolster the use and development of blockchain tech in the Empire State.      The first bill, S4142, would recognize blockchain-based records and contracts as electronic signatures under state law, giving them legal clout. The second, S6037A, would add “distributed ledger technology” developers to the Excelsior Jobs Program, which comes with tax credits.      Introduced by Senator Diane Savino (D-23) and approved by the Internet and Technology Committee, which she chairs, after a hearing Tuesday, the bills next go to the full Senate for a vote. If passed, the measures will move to the New York State Assembly for consideration.      “The use cases are tremendous,” said Adriana Babino, a cybersecurity expert and resident technical adviser on Savino’s Internet and Technology committee. “By embracing the blockchain tech and the digitized ledger, you're opening up the state to many possibilities.”      She said these bills specifically will add secure protections to residents’ use of digital transactions and create employment opportunities.      The bills have been tried in the state legislature before, according to Barbara O’Neill, senior adviser to Savino.      Both bills were introduced, in various iterations, during the 2017-2018 legislative session, part of the early efforts by Savino’s committee to bring more high-tech legislative initiatives to the state government.      That committee is now entering its second year, having formed shortly after Democrats took control of the state Senate for the first time in half a century. The 2019 committee launch helped the Senate streamline all forms of internet-related legislative actions, including those related to blockchain.      The New York State Assembly has no full committee for internet and technology although it does have a subcommittee, chaired by blockchain proponent Assemblyman Clyde Vanel (D-33), which must refer all approved legislation to another committee. Small bureaucratic distinctions add hurdles to any legislative action, slowing down or even stifling the passage of lower-priority bills, according to O’Neill.      “Coming from a subcommittee process it’s a little bit more awkward. Their stuff kind of ends up all over the place,” O’Neill said. She said the Senate committee is hopeful that at some point soon the Assembly will elevate Vanel’s committee to full status.      Even so, Babino, the technical adviser, said Albany is coming around to the concept of blockchain. Last year, staffers and senators asked basic questions about blockchain and distributed ledger technology, prompting Babino to develop an explainer presentation. But this year many appear more comfortable with the technology, which helps them see the value of the legislation, she said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | WALLET,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/02/14/blockchain-bills-are-advancing-in-the-new-york-state-senate-heres-why,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0c2847c49cbf878d56c352cae3565c01bd1f046d-1500x1017.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431561,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN3Lth,1581678000,Bitcoin Closing on Daily Golden Cross That Could Bring Boost to 2020 Price Rally,"View  Bitcoin’s (BTC) short-term and long-term daily moving averages look likely to converge soon, creating the potential for a daily golden cross, a bullish pattern not seen for nearly 10 months.  The 14-day relative strength index is registering near-overbought conditions, a possible sign of buyer exhaustion that may see a short-term pullback.  The weekly chart indicates strong buyer momentum after breaking out of a 203-day descending channel on Jan. 20.  Bull bias would be aborted with a firm close below $9,706, an area of major bullish gains previously.    Bitcoin may see a move higher in coming weeks, courtesy of two major daily moving averages heading for a collision dubbed a golden cross.      The cross occurs when a short-term moving average (MA) crosses above a longer-term one, typically the 50-day and 200-day MAs, hinting at strong upward momentum in an assets price.      The last time such an instance occurred was back in April 2019, when the price of BTC rose 175 percent to create a yearly high of around $13,880 after a temporary pullback to $4,995, Bitstamp data shows.      Therefore, if history repeats, BTC could be in for a short-term drop before making its way to a new high for 2020.    Daily chart    The convergence of the two key MAs are an indication of strong buying pressure as BTC continues to post positive gains year to date. Bitcoin is up 43.5 percent since Jan. 1 and up 175 percent year on year from the Feb 14, 2019, close of $3,560.      However, the golden cross will need a sustained positive follow-through or the odds of a deeper pullback may rise.      Supporting the potential for short-term losses, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) – an indicator used to judge the momentum of a given trend – is currently indicating near overbought conditions with a reading of 67.2. A value of 70 and above represents overbought, while 30 and below hints at an asset being oversold.      Additionally, yesterday’s bearish engulfing candle opened the doors for another test of $10,000. The temporary pullback could be extended if prices fall beneath the $10,000 psychological resistance, exposing $9,867, a region of former hourly resistances.    Weekly chart    Overall, price action has been trending bullish, as demonstrated by a weekly price breakout on Jan. 20 from the almost seven-month descending channel, beginning late last July.      The 50-period MA on the weekly chart (yellow line) has been signaling bullish momentum when prices have remained above it, as seen in 2017 and the first quarter of 2018. Prices remained bearish below throughout the latter half of 2018 and all of 2019, indicating weaker buyer demand.      Prices remain firmly above the 50 MA, hinting at greater buying power ahead of the expected bullish ""halving"" event in May 2020, a supply cut programmed into bitcoin's code that sees miners' rewards reduced by 50 percent.      The mid-term bullish view would be compromised should prices drop below $9,706, the level of a major bullish engulfing candle on Feb. 11. That could upset the prospects for the incoming daily golden cross and a continued rally to new 2020 highs.

42431560,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN3Lrh,1581674466,Binance Adds 15 Fiat Currencies as Exchange Pushes Global Expansion,"Binance has added payment support for 15 fiat currencies in a major push to corner local markets.      The Malta-based cryptocurrency exchange announced Friday that users can now purchase cryptocurrencies with a longer list of supported fiat currencies through its integration with Israeli fiat payments processor Simplex.      The new integration provides gateways for currencies including the Swiss franc, Korean won and Australian dollar, as well as the Polish zloty and South African rand. Currencies that have already been made available through Binance's fiat-to-crypto trading facility, such as pound sterling and Russian ruble, are also now supported through Simplex.      Developers confirmed the integration was fully operational by Thursday afternoon.      Supported fiat currencies will be paired with Binance's base cryptocurrencies – the assets the exchange uses for its default trading pairs. These currently include bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), XRP (XRP), as well as some selected fiat currencies, including the U.S. dollar and the Nigerian naira.      Data collected for CoinDesk suggest fiat volumes make up only a tiny fraction of Binance's trading activity. With 30-day average daily volumes at around $3.55 billion, only $3.5 million of that was in fiat.      As the graph below highlights, the vast majority of this volume has been in U.S. dollars since a gateway for the currency was opened. As Binance folds some of its supported currencies into U.S. dollars, it isn't certain if end users are entirely behind all of Binance's dollar volume.      Simplex first partnered with Binance in January 2019, allowing users to purchase cryptocurrencies with credit and debit card payments denominated in euros, U.S. and Canadian dollars, and Japanese yen.      Although Simplex charges a 3 percent fee – plus a $10 flat fee for any purchases below $200 – it is designed to be cheaper than paying straight from a bank or card provider, which usually levy an additional three percent FX fee on top of any other fees charged for a fiat-crypt swap.      Encouraging users to trade in their local currency could enhance Binance's global appeal. In October, CEO Changpeng Zhao said the company had integrated Russian rubles into the platform after describing the country as one of their key markets. On Thursday, the exchange announced it had hired a former Uber product lead to begin building a range of services specific to local markets.

In a job listing posted late last year, the agency called for applicants from the U.S. who have a background in economics. The deadline to apply is Feb. 28.      The agency said the research – the first of its kind for the intelligence community’s post-doc program – could help the U.S. prepare for “black swan” events that would threaten the dominance of the dollar. This type of unpredictable event is beyond what is normally expected of a situation and has potentially severe consequences.      This particular study falls under the purview of the National Counterproliferation Center, an ODNI unit that looks for ways to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, in part by preventing terrorist financing. According to intelligence officials familiar with the matter, the research would be shared broadly within the intelligence community.      While officials wouldn’t attribute the study’s initiation to any one event or trend, the post-doc researcher listing does cite predictions from “cryptocurrency enthusiasts” that a global cryptocurrency or national digital currency could undermine the U.S. dollar, and mentions the growing economies of China and India.      ""If either of these scenarios or others come to pass, the U.S. would lose both its status in the world and its global authorities,” the agency wrote in the listing. “The U.S. should prepare to identify potential 'black swan' events that could revolutionize the financial playing field in ways we do not yet understand – presenting strategic surprise – and understand root causes and driving factors that are particularly sensitive to certain global or technical events.""      The post-doc program starts at the beginning of the next fiscal year on Oct. 1 and runs for two years. The research is unclassified and the researcher doesn’t receive any special clearances, but researchers will receive ODNI’s sponsorship, funding and access to IT including advanced computing, the officials said. The agency also wouldn’t control the researcher’s work but would check in periodically to make sure the agency understands it.      ODNI said it can also connect the researcher with experts at ODNI and other government entities, like the Federal Reserve, but will not provide data or information that is not already publicly available.      The agency is looking for a researcher who will apply statistics, artificial intelligence and deep learning to historical “black swan” events and possible future scenarios.

After 18 months of development, their project, Apifiny, revealed a platform Wednesday targeting exchanges hampered by low liquidity: ExOne. It is an emerging finances back-end tool tied to technological advances in traditional markets, which, despite their off-chain standing, have myriad advantages over crypto exchanges.      “These marketplaces are highly fragmented and remarkably inefficient,” said Co-Chairman David Weild, a former vice chair of Nasdaq. “If an investor goes to one marketplace the bid that he sees in that one marketplace may be wildly different than it is in another venue.”      Bid discrepancies can be a turnoff for investors used to accessing relatively stable quotes from a consolidated marketplace, Weild said. Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies have no such price coherence; real-time bids can vary by thousands of dollars from one market to the next.      “If your pipes, so to speak, don’t see both venues, then you're going to have a risk of getting a much worse execution,” Weild said.      ExOne wants to lay those proverbial pipes. Built by Apfiny's 100-plus team out of San Francisco and a handful of distributed offices, it's the plumbing to a more interconnected, consolidated trading experience. Its executives include CTO Ashu Swami, former VP of Program trading at Morgan Stanley; Head of Product Connie Wong, former Design Lead at Kraken; and CEO of Retail Product Ben Rab, formerly Visa’s head of Global Network Product Support.      As Weild explained it, ExOne will reach across the marketplaces to generate a consolidated quote, a “global best bid and offer” that secures the most optimal bid for the system’s users.      That’s similar to the “national best bid and offer,” a Wall street term referring to a broker’s Security and Exchange Commission-mandated responsibility to get their clients the best possible price.      And though ExOne provides a service for crypto, Weild, who couched his explanation of ExOne and digital assets at large with the language of a Wall Street trading desk, said the platform’s utility has precedence in the traditional markets.      In the U.S., the SEC’s “Regulation NMS” pushed equity marketplaces to link together in a network of pooled quotes. The idea there was to partly to modernize the country’s disparate, electronic marketplaces in a single, accessible way.      “This is what we’re looking to do in the digital asset space, broadly defined and globally,” Weild said.      ExOne is not yet operational; Apifiny has not yet announced a release date.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/14/nasdaq-morgan-stanley-trading-vets-build-startup-to-unite-crypto-market-price-ranges,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/778b8b797d75026c2897edfad5a5bd64a584ed4d-1200x770.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431553,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN3Lhh,1581645600,Trump Fed Nominee Judy Shelton Says US Should Be Proactive on Digital Dollar,"Judy Shelton, President Donald Trump’s nominee to the Federal Reserve Board, told lawmakers that digitizing the U.S. dollar could help maintain the currency’s ascendancy in global commerce.      At her Senate confirmation hearing Thursday, Shelton said the U.S. needs fintech innovation to keep ahead of other countries.      “Yes, it is a dominant reserve currency but we can’t rest on our laurels in that regard,” Shelton said. “Rival nations are working very diligently to have an alternative to the dollar. I think it is very important that we get ahead of the curve to ensure that the dollar continues to offer the best currency in the world.”      When asked by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) how she will address the need for a digital dollar, Shelton said, “It is an extremely important discussion and we are compelled to think about that.”      Her comments come at a time when digital currency initiatives by China's central bank and the Facebook-spawned Libra Association have spurred the U.S. and other Western nations to seriously consider launching their own electronic monies.      Two weeks ago, former officials from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) set up a nonprofit to design proposals for a digital dollar. Earlier this week, Fed Chairman Powell told lawmakers that Libra was ""a wake-up call"" for the central bank, while emphasizing that its research was in the early stages.    From goldbug to rate-cutter    Shelton has been a longtime advocate for the gold standard, which strictly pegs a currency’s value to gold, and has opposed the Fed’s easy-money policies.      “Gold standard rules permit nations to participate voluntarily by operating in accordance with the discipline of gold convertibility of their own currencies,” Shelton wrote in an article published by the libertarian Cato Institute in 2018.      “A modern version of this approach — one that permits the issuance of virtual currencies in tandem with government-issued currencies, adapting legal tender laws to permit healthy currency competition — should be put forward,” she added.      More recently, however, Shelton has come under criticism for supporting the president's position that interest rates, already historically low, should be cut further.      Trump nominated Shelton for the Fed board in July along with Chris Waller, director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

42431551,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN3Ldh,1581642518,"MIT Wasn't Only One Auditing Voatz – Homeland Security Did Too, With Fewer Concerns","CORRECTION (Feb. 21, 21:50 UTC): Because of inaccurate information provided by the West Virginia Secretary of State's office, an earlier version of this article misdescribed the subject document as a declassified DHS report. It is a summary published by Voatz of a still-classified DHS report.      The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) found a number of security vulnerabilities in Voatz’s technical infrastructure during a cybersecurity audit of the mobile voting app vendor’s Boston headquarters, according to a newly declassified report obtained by CoinDesk.      However, the DHS report, conducted by a Hunt and Incident Response Team with the department’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) also determined Voatz had no active threats on its network during the week-long operation, conducted in September. It developed a series of recommendations to further boost Voatz’s security. Voatz has since addressed those recommendations.      The CISA report was shared with CoinDesk hours after a technical paper by MIT researchers claimed to detail a number of major vulnerabilities in the Medici-backed Voatz’s app, including allegations the app leaves voters’ identities open to adversaries and that ballots can be altered.      The MIT report, published Thursday by graduate students Michael Specter and James Koppel and principal research scientist Daniel Weitzner, further alleges the app has limited transparency, a claim also raised by a number of security researchers.      “Our findings serve as a concrete illustration of the common wisdom against Internet voting, and of the importance of transparency to the legitimacy of elections,” the MIT researchers said in the report.      However, the CISA audit, which focuses less on the app itself and more on Voatz’s internal network and servers, draws a different conclusion. The DHS investigators wrote that while they found some issues that could pose future concerns to Voatz’s networks, overall the team “commends Voatz for their proactive measures” in monitoring for potential threats.      The two reports paint contrasting pictures of how the company, whose app has been used in pilot programs and live elections in West Virginia, Colorado and Utah, approaches voting security. Further, at least one election official overseeing the Voatz app rollout believes the MIT study is missing data in its evaluation.      The MIT researchers did not return a request for comment by press time.    MIT findings    The MIT report relies on a reverse engineering of the Voatz app and reimplemented “clean room” server, according to the researchers, who did not interact with Voatz’s live servers or its purported blockchain back end.      They found privacy vulnerabilities and a wealth of potential avenues for attack in the app. Adversaries could infer user vote choice, corrupt the audit trail and even change what appeared on the ballot, the researchers said.      The researchers’ findings and faults did not focus on Voatz’s use of a blockchain, at least in part because they did not have access to the permissioned blockchain on which Voatz is said to store and authenticate votes. Instead, they report the Voatz app never submits vote information to any “blockchain-like system.”      Criticizing Voatz’s lack of transparency, the researchers further argued the company’s “black box” approach to public documentation could, in tandem with the bugs, erode public trust.      “The legitimacy of the government relies on scrutiny and transparency of the democratic process to ensure that no party or outside actor can unduly alter the outcome,” the report said.      Ultimately, the researchers recommended elected officials “abandon” the app outright.      “It remains unclear if any electronic-only mobile or Internet voting system can practically overcome the stringent security requirements on election systems,” they said.      But Amelia Powers Gardner, a Utah County, Utah, election auditor who supervised her county’s rollout of the Voatz system for disabled voters and service members deployed overseas, told CoinDesk that at least some of the bugs the researchers found cannot be exploited in practice.      “[The researchers] weren't able to substantiate these claims because they were never able to actually connect to the Voatz server,” Powers Gardner said. “So in theory they claim that they may have been able to do these things, and only on the Android version, not the Apple version.”      She said the MIT researchers’ effort comes from “what ifs, and perhaps, and maybes that, frankly, just haven’t panned out,” and that the app had since been patched.      For Powers Gardner, Voatz’s benefits far outweigh any security risks. She said the software is a far better alternative for otherwise disenfranchised voting groups than the current technological solution: email.      “While these concerns of around mobile loading can be valid, they don't rise to a level of security that causes me to even question the use of the mobile app,” she said.      John Sebes, co-founder and chief technology officer of the Open Source Election Technology Institute, said a number of the researchers’ concerns still stand, despite Powers Gardner’s claims.      Election officials and computer scientists live in very different worlds, and therefore may not see eye to eye, he said. However, he added, computer science researchers do not need to understand an election official’s world to be able to assess a software vendor’s claims.      “We can't validate Voatz’s claims that newer versions were better, but it's still the case that the version inspected had some fairly basic issues,” Sebes said.      In response to Powers Gardner’s claims the researchers claims were speculative, or “what ifs,” Sebes said this reflected a misunderstanding of the value of this kind of security assessment.      The goal is to find vulnerabilities in the software that could enable adversaries to conduct a successful cyber operation, rather than claim an actual attack occurred, Sebes said.    Still voting electronically    Voatz itself took issue with the MIT report, insinuating in a statement that the researchers were embarking on a fear campaign.      “It is clear that from the theoretical nature of the researchers’ approach… that the researchers’ true aim is to deliberately disrupt the election process, to sow doubt in the security of our election infrastructure, and to spread fear and confusion,” the statement said.      The company’s response to the DHS report was more measured; while there was no written statement – and a spokesperson did not return a request for comment – the government investigators said Voatz had taken action on most of their recommendations.      Still, the DHS report remains inconclusive about the Voatz app itself.      West Virginia, one of the states that used the app, claims it has seen no issues so far.      Mike Queen, a spokesperson for West Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner, said the state’s 2018 pilot for overseas military voters went off without a hitch. However, he was noncommittal as to whether the state would continue using Voatz.      “Secretary Warner and his team will make a decision prior to March 1 regarding the technology that we will prescribe for use in the May 2020 Primary Election,” he said. “As we have done from the very start, our decision will be based on the best available information with a strong emphasis on security and accessibility.”      Like Utah’s Powers Gardner, Queen said any potential physical disabilities or geographic location should not prevent voters from participating in the democratic process.      “I don't have a duty to an out-of-town researcher who doesn't understand how elections are actually run,” Powers Gardner said. “I have a duty to stand up for the constitutional rights of the disabled voters in my community, and I'm going to ensure their constitutional right to vote in the safest way that I know how.”      Read the full DHS report below:",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | RESEARCH,"Danny Nelson, Nikhilesh De, Benjamin Powers",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/14/mit-wasnt-only-one-auditing-voatz-homeland-security-did-too-with-fewer-concerns,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a436346cf459ba74c24f9b3cfd596d410b6ef26c-1200x770.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
