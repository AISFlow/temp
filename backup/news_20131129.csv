42376751,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cpNh,1385743835,"No Hiding Place in Bitcoin, Real Mining for Virtual Cash, and the Wrong Sort of Fun","Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 29th November 2013 – a regular look at the hottest, most controversial and thought-provoking events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of skepticism and wonder. Your host … John Law.  How to be anonymous: avoid bitcoin  As the first currency of the Internet, bitcoin has many attributes of its host network. Namely, it can be perfectly anonymous and perfectly transparent at the same time.  No, it is not necessary to have any record linking your name to what goes on in there – but good luck hiding anything.  Knowing enough about what someone does is just as good as knowing who they are, and often much more useful. In this world, what you do is much more important that what you’re called.  Hence, we know that nearly $150m in bitcoins was transferred on 22nd November. This was the largest transfer in the history of the currency (by value).  Moreover, it is most probable that this was an internal 'housekeeping' move by Bitstamp, the second-largest dollar bitcoin exchange. All this data, both the certain and the speculative kind, is entirely public and can be discovered by examining the block chain.  Do we know what internal housekeeping financial transactions were made by banks, hedge funds or Richard Branson on 22nd November? No. You can be very sure they’re very happy to keep it that way. Financial types cherish their secrecy.  But isn’t bitcoin supposed to help money launderers, terrorists, drug traffickers and other criminal types move their money without attracting attention?  On this evidence, bitcoin comes in second to a friendly chap with a pinstripe suit and a brass plate on the front door.  Admittedly, anyone moving that much money through the banking system will trigger tripwires, but if you know where they are and who’s looking – which you will – it's easier to look innocent.  With bitcoin, everyone 'sees' and you don’t know who’s looking, nor what they’re looking for.  Were he to run a dodgy operation requiring a major cash transfer, John Law would probably not do it in public. He would probably ask the existing criminal overlords how they’ve been doing it all these years.  Not that it seems that hard. By purest coincidence, $150m is almost the exact amount the US Government is thought to have handed over to terrorists in Afghanistan by funding the companies they control.  Admittedly, the details aren’t entirely clear and it would take digging through various levels of official secrecy and obfuscation to find out.  Perhaps if the US used bitcoin next time, it’d be easier to spot (and thus stamp out) this sort of support for terrorists. Just a thought.  How green was my wallet?  A tweet just flitted across John Law’s Twitter feed: “It’s nearly midnight. What are all these people doing at Newport municipal tip?”  This being Twitter, it could be a joke – but it could be true, and John Law rather suspects it is.  For the Welsh landfill site is the last resting place for a hard drive that once lived in a Dell laptop belonging to one James Howells, IT type and early bitcoin fan.    Not much of a fan, though: having mined 7,500 BTC in 2009, he got bored and forgot about them.      The laptop died and was thrown away – all but the hard disk, which Howells kept for its data. This summer, he found the hard disk and threw it out. A week ago, he remembered.    Hence the sudden interest in the landfill. Normally, finding an object the size of a packet of playing cards six feet under somewhere in an area of decomposing Welsh waste the size of a football pitch would be madness in a funny hat.  But with £4m at stake, the odds are a lot better than you’ll get from the lottery, and there’s all the exercise and fresh air too. Well, exercise.  Plus, if you’re going to mine bitcoin the old-fashioned way, you can’t do better than Wales.  The really good thing about bitcoin in this situation is, assuming the disk has survived in some sort of readable state (John Law would place that bet) then it’s ideal buried treasure.  A smart approach for Mr Howells would be to announce a 10% finder’s fee, and then go back to doing IT things somewhere warm, dry and not so smelly.  If the dosh was in cash, or diamonds, or gold-plated unicorn poo, then the finder could just pocket the lot and run for the hills.  But bitcoin lives in encrypted wallets, so without the Howellian key, it’s just an obsolete, odiferous hard drive with an eBay value of tuppence. You must give it back to get the dosh.  John Law expects the drive to come to light, especially if there’s a plumptious reward.  All it would take is a thousand people who think they’re in with a shout of, say, £400,000, and the whole place would be turned over in a weekend.  Admittedly, the council has said it won’t let people in – but it’ll take more than that to keep the good people of Newport from their rightful payday.  It is a little sad for Mr Howells that he didn’t have a backup (him being an IT type and all) although, to be charitable, he’d already whipped the pictures, documents and other things off.  It is hard not to giggle when one sees that the BBC concludes its report on the affair by asking Mr Howells what he thinks about bitcoin now.  Oh, he says, It’s going to continue to appreciate in value:  ""I still believe in bitcoin. I believe its value is going to go much, much higher and it's still in its early days. As soon as access to bitcoin is opened up to the general public , I think a lot more people will be using it, hence the price will increase further.""  It seems the qualifications for being a broadcast pundit on bitcoin is to have accidentally lost four million quids’ worth of the stuff because you didn’t even know they were there.  Salaryman, beware!    One is the valuation, of course: that’s going to get messy, so good luck if you’re in for the ride.      Another is that there’s a bitcoin payroll service. No, really there is. Canadian company Wagepoint is adding bitcoin capabilities to its local service, with the US coming early next year.      And, like any payroll services company, Wagepoint will manage a company’s wages and ship regular remuneration to its employees – but in bitcoin.      One day, this will make sense. One day, a bitcoin will be worth much the same this month as it was last month. One day, you’ll be able to pay your mortgage, buy your pasta and give your children their pocket money in bitcoin. On that day, getting some or all of your salary in bitcoin will make a lot of sense.      That day is not today. Only a drug-crazed okapi in a purple waistcoat would think otherwise. John Law is not that okapi.      So, why? And how?      No, not how you run a bitcoin payroll service, that’s simple enough. In any case, it’s not really a bitcoin payroll service, in the sense that it moves bitcoin from an employer to an employee; it’s an automatic conversion service.      Wagepoint scoops off a percentage of the worker’s net wages after the employer has paid them to Wagepoint, converts them through a deal with a bitcoin exchange, and passes the bitcoin along to the employee’s private wallet.      That’s nothing here the employee couldn’t do for themselves, with the exception that Wagepoint has done a deal with the exchange for a better rate than an individual employee could get off the peg.      None of which explains the 'why'.      “It’s like stock options,” says the company – only it isn’t. Stock options are tied to the book value of a company in a generally-accepted way, and are part of the great wonderland of corporate finance and taxation that everyone understands. Bitcoin is none of those things.      Of course, there’s nothing to stop companies handing out bitcoin to its employees. Rather fun, in a way.      But in the name of okapis in rehab everywhere, please do it in a way that makes sense in light of bitcoin’s grotesque volatility, uncertain legal status and general experimentation.      The payroll is no place for any of that stuff. If you want to bung a chunk of your salary into bitcoin, then go ahead – but please, don’t do it automatically.      Wagepoint disagrees. It describes its Wagepoint Pay service as a “FUN, incredibly awesome, fully automated and cloud-based payroll software”.      Ah, ""FUN"". In capital letters. That explains it.    John Law doesn’t think you can have automatic fun. Automatic is for stuff that isn’t fun – that’s rather the idea.  That’s why you have direct debits for your insurance and your water bill, but take your cash to the bookie on a Saturday afternoon to judiciously place them on the nag of your choice. That’s how to have fun.  You may disgree, but one thing is certain – it beats digging through somebody else’s decomposing underwear in Newport on a late November night.  The things bitcoin makes people do.  John Law is an 18th century Scottish entrepreneur, financial engineer and gambler.

42376740,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cpDd,1385730615,China's Third-Largest Mobile Network Now Accepts Bitcoin,"Consumers in China can now purchase smartphones with bitcoin from a major carrier, after a local division of China Telecom announced a promotional offer for new Samsung phones this week.  China Telecom's subsidiary Jiangsu Telecom, in Jiangsu province on the east coast of the country, posted the offer on its website. Translated details were scarce, but it appears customers have the chance to use bitcoin instead of yuan to pre-order Samsung's 2014 clamshell form-factor Android phone.  Payments are processed through BitBill, China's answer to BitPay.  Bitcoin's popularity has soared higher in China than anywhere else in the world recently, with world-record prices appearing on BTC China, the country's main exchange and now the world's busiest. BTC China was leading the world in bitcoin value even in April, when prices passed $300.  [post-quote]  Any business newly accepting bitcoin, even in a small way, is guaranteed to gain disproportionate attention in these times. So on the surface, many recent stories of bitcoin acceptance from China seem more promotional than revolutionary. Indeed, this is a limited offer for one model phone from a local provider and not a major announcement of large-scale bitcoin adoption.  However, it's also a sign large state owned enterprises in China, or at least certain divisions of them, are more open to experimentation with bitcoin than their overseas counterparts.  As of this month, most bitcoin acceptance in other parts of the world remains limited to owner-operated small businesses and startups. A division of Chinese internet search giant Baidu also announced recently it would accept bitcoin as payment.  Jiangsu Telecom's offer also strikes a more positive note than previous reports from China earlier in 2013, which suggested China Telecom was trying to block bitcoin-related traffic from its services. China Telecom is China's largest fixed-line provider and its third-largest mobile carrier.  If bitcoin can be used as a promotional tool to attract younger and more technology-aware consumers, it also indicates the Chinese market itself is more ready for alternate forms of payment.

42376738,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cp8b,1385728552,UK Bitcoin-Buying Service Bittylicious Adds Feathercoin,"Marc Warne, CEO at Bittylicious, is keen to support Britain's burgeoning cryptocurrency feathercoin, planning to offer it on his website next month.  This digital currency hails from Oxford, under the leadership of Peter Bushnell. He started feather coin in April 2012, in order to set up a currency that revolved primarily around a community.  Warne says of the feathercoin team:  “I liked their attitude. They are trying to build a functioning economy and ecosystem and there are a few places in Oxford that accept feathercoin already. They have a couple of pubs and a bike repair shop, it’s good to see it has a physical presence there.”  Bittylicious  , a UK platform that enables users to buy bitcoins via bank transfer, has been running since April this year.  Sellers supply buyers with bitcoins at a premium price, but this means buyers can get their hands on bitcoins without waiting two days for a bank transfer to go through. In contrast, it takes between seven and 10 days for an exchange like Bitstamp or Mt. Gox to check a buyer's credentials.  Warne told CoinDesk: “We’re planning to launch feathercoin on our platform in December for certain. The work has been done, mostly, and we just want to make some test transactions before we go live. In the new year it’s likely that litecoins will be a part of it too.""  When asked how Bittylicious is progressing, he responded positively:  ""It seems to be doing pretty well – when bitcoin rises a lot, the amount we take in rises a lot. Turnover on a daily basis has risen four- or five-fold in the last five weeks, up from about £5,000 a day to £40,000 a day, from which Bittylicious takes a 1% cut of the bitcoins transacted.”  In terms of competition, Warne sees it as a good thing: “I’m not worried about competition, competition is great! We all have different ideas and everyone is in it together. The community is definitely there to help bitcoins become more popular.""  There are currently about 20 sellers on Bittylicious, of which around 10 are online at any given time. However, Warne's company also sells its own coins when supply cannot meet demand.  UK policy  On the subject of tax in the UK, Warne highlighted that HMRC (the UK's customs and tax department) demands 20% VAT on sales revenues over £79,000.  ""So for example, if I bought a bitcoin for £100 and I sold it for £110, I would have to pay HMRC £20. So, obviously I would make a loss,"" he explained.  Warne comments that HMRC has issued contradictory advice about tax, but asserts his customers have ""different business models and tax arrangements"" so it's not necessary for him to keep track of all that information.  When it comes to Bittylicious' know-your-customer (KYC) policies and records, the CEO pointed out he is required to keep personal data about buyers and sellers by law, confirming that Bittylicious conforms to data protection regulations and current money-laundering regulations (MLR) in the UK. He said:  ""We've been challenged on this by one customer, but we simply quoted our registration number, and the issue went away.""  Warne also points out that Bittylicious doesn't actually hold customer funds, so it is not in the legally complicated area that bitcoin exchanges are.  ""We're in the wrong country if we wanted to do that,"" he chuckles. ""We enabled Pingit yesterday, and if there were other suitable payment options in future, they could be added.""  Feathercoin value  Feathercoin may become a significant feather in the cap of Bittylicious, since the value of the currency has increased from just 10p (16 cents) two weeks ago to it's current high of 40p.  The young cryptocurrency features an 'Advanced Checkpointing System' where trusted nodes in the network agree on the valid version of the feathercoin block chain every six blocks.  Warne mentions that with potential ASIC miners on their way for scrypt coins like litecoin and feathercoin, the possibility of a 51% attack may be on the horizon. However, he's quick to note that feathercoin's checkpointing system is an excellent defence against this possibility.  Feathercoin's Chris Ellis told CoinDesk: ""Thousands of people have signed up to the feathercoin forum at local.feathercoin.com, we have numerous merchants in the community, and more are joining all the time. We're always looking forward and trying to develop a healthy and positive ecosystem for Feathercoin.""",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Richard Boase,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/29/uk-bitcoin-buying-service-bittylicious-adds-feathercoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/06049025e4849a1935edb3cef2c0cfb71adaed24-1000x580.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42375634,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw9NtF,1385715225,One Bitcoin Was Worth MORE Than an Ounce of Gold Today,"The price has since dipped, and at the time of writing is trading at $1,146 on Gox, below the gold spot price of $1,246 per ounce in US dollars.  The price of the coin, which broke $1,000 just a few days ago, has been rapidly approaching the price of gold, which has fallen in recent weeks. Today it reached a high of $1,242 on Mt. Gox, topping gold’s $1,241.98 at the time.  Erik Voorhees, an early entrepreneur in bitcoin, was in jubilant spirits. Voorhees, who sold his gambling site SatoshiDice for 126,315 BTC this year, said that it was a psychologically significant event. He said:  “For believers, it means bitcoin is really becoming a ‘respectable asset’. Clearly, bitcoin is no longer a penny stock. It's playing in the big leagues - a share being worth more than a share of Google or Apple, and even more then an ounce of gold.”  “Many of us two or three years ago said that bitcoin could (and probably should) absolutely cost more than an ounce of gold. We were laughed at and ridiculed. Now we can just look and say, ‘scoreboard!’.”  This isn't bitcoin's first symbolic price threshold, points out Anthony Di Iorio, the head of Canada's Bitcoin Alliance, a national organisation that promotes bitcoin. ""It went past $500 and then $1,000, and now it's past gold,"" he said. It is widely known that the value of the virtual currency surpassed silver long ago.  Falling gold prices  Bitcoin may have been rising to meet the price of gold, the precious metal has also fallen to meet it. The price of gold has taken a dive this year. At the start of the year, it sat at around $1,700 before plummeting to a yearly low in July.  It rallied to just over $1,400 in September, but since then it has fallen to a four-month low.  Gold's latest fall saw it drop $10 in around 10 seconds on 20th November. This drop accompanied news that the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) have begun an investigation into pricing methods for gold on the spot market (the market where people trade directly between each other).  Traditionally, gold spot prices are set during a London-based conference call between five banks. Prices from those discussions are used to set spot prices for gold worldwide.  In addition to the FCA investigation, the German regulator, BaFin, is also said to be exploring the issue.  Other issues affecting the price of gold in recent months include fears over a potentially early end to US stimulus measures, as stronger economic data emerges.When the US central bank buys bonds it tends to boost gold prices because people buy it to hedge against possible inflation.  Could bitcoin be gold 2.0? That’s unlikely, thinks Voorhees. He remarked that the cryptocurrency has several advantages over the precious metal. Primarily, it can be transported anywhere in the world instantaneously, making it suitable for Internet payments. It is also far easier to divide and recombine than gold. He added:  ”Put simply, it's impractical for normal economic exchange. While it's true that a digital gold could exist, such as e-gold, we know how that turned out.”  On the other hand, gold continues to work even when the Internet does not, and it is a long-standing, stable, and well-understood commodity. It's immune to bugs, hackers and the loss of community support.  “This is very special, and cannot be replaced by bitcoin for a very long time,” Voorhees said.  Although we know how many bitcoins we can mine, we only have a rough idea of how much gold is left in the ground, and how difficult it is to get. According to the World Gold Council, we have mined 174,100 tonnes of the stuff since civilisation began, which would fit into a 21 metre cube.  Much of that is, of course, locked up in jewellery and industrial applications (and a considerable number of teeth). Actual world gold reserves total 31,575.1 tonshttps://www.gold.org/download/value/stats/statistics/archive/pdf/World_Official_Gold_Holdings_as_of_January2013_IFS.pdf. The US is the largest single holder of gold reserves.  Bitcoin's market capitalisation today is around $13.5bn. The total value of all gold mined in the world, at today's price, stands at around $7.6 trillion. The total value of the world's current reserve holdings is around $1.38 trillion.  Di Iorio says he lost 20% on his own gold investments last year. ""I took my loss and put it into bitcoin and got my return back,"" he said. ""I no longer have gold holdings. I believe much more in the fundamentals of bitcoin.""  Gold is superior for conservative, steady, long-term storage of wealth, Voorhees suggested, while bitcoin is far better for commerce and payments. Voorhees advises people to keep their savings mostly in gold, and their spending money mostly in bitcoin.  “As bitcoin's price crosses that of gold, it shouldn't be taken as an indication that ‘bitcoin is better,’” Voorhees concluded. He added: “They're just different, and a proper understanding of the monetary virtues of both gold and bitcoin puts one ahead of just about everyone else on earth.”  Not everyone agrees, though. Venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, who heads up the Social+Capital Partnership, has gone on the record to advocate bitcoin's potential for stored value.  ""What you’re talking about right now is, for the next three to five years, an unbelievably better stored value. It is gold 2.0. Right?"" he said to Forbes in April, arguing that bitcoin can be used to store long-term value outside of government control.  ""Well, guess what? I can do the same thing with Bitcoin, only I can do it outside the purview of every single government. It’s being used everywhere you would think it would be used: Russia, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Venezuela, Argentina. Everywhere you have currency pressure. Everywhere you want to basically shield your assets. And then, after that, it will probably become a payment mechanism.""  In this Bloomberg article, Palihapitiya says that he transferred 1% of all his assets to bitcoin as 'schmuck insurance', lest catastrophe in the financial markets cause problems for the precious metal.  He also calculates how much a bitcoin would be worth if all bitcoins were to have the same capitalisation as all the mined gold in existence. He divides his estimate ($8 trillion) by the theoretical number of bitcoins (21 million) and comes up with a theoretical upper bound of $400,000 per bitcoin.  This symbolic crossing for bitcoin does not necessarily mean that it's better than gold, but it will likely bode well for the currency. Di Iorio says that the news will make yet more people aware of bitcoin.  This, combined with a backlog of verifications in some exchanges (he cites Canada's Virtex as having a three week backlog) suggests that prices will continue to rise, at least for a while, as more people begin trading bitcoin, and the market continues to thicken.  ""We will see more people going after this scarce supply, and the price will jump up,"" Di Iorio says. Unlike gold, we have a precise picture of how many new bitcoins will become available over time.
