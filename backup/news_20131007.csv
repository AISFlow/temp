42376602,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bOzZ,1381152602,PhenixCoin in ashes after developer goes AWOL,"The PhenixCoin altcoin is in disarray, after its sole developer disappeared from the scene. Its community manager and PR handler have both walked away from the initiative, and the founder of the coin has stopped communicating.  PhenixCoin, launched in May, was one of the three coins that were part of the original UNOCS initiative to create a software bridge between altcoins.  PhenixCoin had been criticized by community members on the BitcoinTalk forum, who slated it for missing development deadlines, making unexpected hard fork decisions, and for its pre-mine of up to 1 million coins.  Last month, UNOCS collapsed, and representatives from partner coins cited a lack of development impetus at PhenixCoin as a major factor.  Michael Burns, the developer behind PhenixCoin and its associated exchange, PhenixEx, posted a message on the BitcoinTalk forum at the end of September, after weeks of disruption at the exchange.  “Due to circumstances in my private life I have neglected support for PhenixEx. Because my situation isn’t going to change. I can’t maintain developing for PhenixCoin and PhenixEx,” he said.  This left many people with coins stuck in the exchange, including not just PhenixCoin (PXC), but also WorldCoins (WDC) and bitcoins.  The Phenix Exchange website is now closed, displaying a message with an email, asking people to send their account details for coin refunds. However, BitcoinTalk forum user 'Joerri', who was PhenixCoin's community manager, still hadn't received his coins (including 9.9 BTC) in spite of asking for a refund around a month ago.  Joerri has not given up on receiving his coins, but he abandoned his role at PhenixCoin last week.  “He’s the only one who had access to PhenixEx – the only one who had access to anything PhenixCoin related”, Joerri says of Burns, “Including our forum that went down. It was a big mess.”  Burns isn't the only person who disappeared. John Carmichael, the founder of PhenixCoin, originally asked CoinDesk for 24 hours to clean up the situation before he spoke to us. This was last Tuesday. On Sunday, after repeated requests, Carmichael had failed to reply.  Carmichael had many ambitions for PhenixCoin and UNOCS, said Jeorri, adding that the coin's founder had a 'go big or go home' attitude.  ""He had a lot of plans for a full HTML 5 casino, that would be compatible with iPads and iPhones, and a poker site."" When Burns departed, all of these ambitions appeared to collapse, and the source code went with him.  Burns failed to respond to phone calls or forum messages, but Joerri and the community public relations executive ‘MaGNeT’ both cited Skype and email conversations with him from the last week.  “I don't scam anyone, never have never will,” said one such conversation.  What has emerged from this whole debacle is that there was next to no governance structure for PhenixCoin, meaning that there was little if any external oversight into how the coin was developed.  ""Maybe it was doomed to failure because of that,"" Joerri says. ""John was always very vague and deflective on those kinds of issues. He wasn't really open for discussion. He was the boss, he ran the ship, and I was manager of the community and allowed to speak to them because he trusted me, but he called all the shots.""  [post-quote]  While Carmichael had strategic control of the coin, it appears that Burns had exclusive access to the code for UNOCS and PhenixEx.  “What I took away from all this is that dumping all the power in one person’s hands is silly,” Joerri argued.  Some are hoping that PhenixCoin may rise from the ashes.  Ghostlander, a prominent contributor to both the FeatherCoin and PhenixCoin communities, has stepped up continued development of the coin’s client software. He has taken the open repository for PhenixCoin and created his own repository on GitHub for this purpose.  Ghostlander, who is creating a new site for the coin at Phenixcoin.org, will not be dealing with any of the side projects, which are essentially dead now. The PhenixPool, PhenixPoker, and Phenix SafeTrade sites (the latter had offered an escrow service) are down at the time of writing.  “Mike developed the coin with no community involved. He did what he wanted to and screwed up because of little experience in this area. Other people wanted to help him, but he ignored them mostly. You see the results,"" complained Ghostlander.  “‪I've decided to take over the development until it's too late,” he continued. “‪If there are other coders [keen] to join the development, that's excellent. Two heads are better than one.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | FORKS,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/10/07/phenixcoin-in-ashes-after-developer-goes-awol,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9622fb94b837b9bf1acca98a075746e448831632-1024x745.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376597,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bOx3,1381145438,SecondMarket's bitcoin offering defines new asset class,"It's not every day that a new asset class is born. The last time was probably a few decades ago when managed futures funds became an accepted asset class among portfolio managers.  Now, alternative trading system company SecondMarket has launched The Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT), an open-ended, private trust that is exclusively invested in bitcoin and derives its value solely from the price of bitcoin.  The private investment vehicle is based in the US and open to institutional and accredited individual investors. Alternative Currency Asset Management (ACAM), a wholly-owned subsidiary of SecondMarket, is BIT's sponsor and SecondMarket has also made a $2 million seed investment in the BIT.  Certainly, a bitcoin trust can be thought of as a unique proxy for investing in bitcoin startups that would not carry the specific risk of management team execution or adopting the correct business model.  Not many other currencies in the world can serve as a proxy investment for an entire high tech, venture-funded sector. Until the bitcoin ecosystem matures and deepens, it will be possible to bet on its success simply by going long on the actual monetary unit.  Generally, the bitcoin funds, or trusts, can also be thought of as precursors to more retail-oriented exchange-traded funds (ETFs) which require substantially more due diligence and regulatory clearance.  When bitcoin ETFs start appearing on a regular basis, bitcoin will have completed its transition into both retail and wholesale asset class.  The bitcoin offering from SecondMarket has been in development for over a year now and it will set the standard for best practices of bitcoin as an asset class in the US.  Non-correlated to other investment classes and alongside more conventional portfolio components like equities, bonds, real estate, and commodities, a position in bitcoin allows a portfolio to participate in the potential upside from an economy based on digital currencies.  Following Exante's Bitcoin Fund from Malta which debuted last year, SecondMarket also intends to facilitate two-way trading of the trust shares on its proprietary platform enabling both long and short positions. This is significant because commercial processors and large merchants of bitcoin would have a reliable method to hedge their bitcoin inventories without having to liquidate actual bitcoin on a daily basis.  For instance, if a bitcoin merchant processor, such as BitPay, wanted to ""lock in"" a certain aggregate exchange rate for their merchants or for their own books, they could initiate a short position in the Bitcoin Investment Trust without the need to sell bitcoin on the open market.  The company has established relationships with over 100 players in the bitcoin space, including large merchants, early adopters, and exchanges which should aid in the development of additional liquidity.  The critic's view  Last week, the forlorn and chronic bitcoin skeptic Felix Salmon, of the Reuters blogging world, took a shot at SecondMarket and their new trust. Salmon says that ""no sensible investor should go anywhere near it"" and he doesn't ""really understand why [Silbert's] doing this.""  Correctly stating that bitcoin is a combination of currency and commodity, Salmon goes on to claim ""this trust strips out the interesting bit, which is the currency part, leaving just the stupidly speculative commodity aspect.""  As with most professional critics at the beginning of a new asset class, the cries of disbelief and suggestions of investor imprudence are to be expected because prior to becoming portfolio orthodoxy an element of risk weeds out the non-brave.  [post-quote]  I wouldn't expect Salmon to promote the adoption of largely undefined risk, but I would expect him to understand why a particular investment vehicle makes sense for certain investors.  Firstly, there is the aspect of institutional participation and the possibility of favorable tax treatment for investments made through retirement funds.  Many endowments and institutions that administer investment funds have strict guidelines for placing those investments such as placement must be with registered broker-dealer. Therefore, a straight investment into bitcoin ""on your own"" would not satisfy those institutional parameters.  Secondly, Salmon must also realize that larger aggregated wholesale purchases of bitcoin can be accomplished at more preferential pricing terms than smaller individuals would be able to achieve acting on their own. The consolidated purchasing power of a trust could easily make up for a good portion of those fees.  Thirdly, and most importantly, the custodial features of safe-keeping and private key management are paramount.  The Bitcoin Investment Trust administrative and safekeeping fee is analogous to the storage fee assessed on gold and precious metals warehousing. Also, a professionally-managed trust provides protection against a slew of risks that could prove overwhelming for the casual weekend bitcoin investor.  For instance, as enunciated by Exante, top-level risks include data loss risk, hardware failure risk, jurisdictional risk, external hacker risk, dishonest employee risk, and employee death or disability risk. Also, succession planning and inheritance are just as important with a bitcoin asset as with any other asset.  Perhaps some year in the future Salmon will look back at this bitcoin article and say ""I was not a True Believer when I really should have known better."" Or, maybe he will be smugly proud of himself for establishing a massive short bitcoin position in 2013. I doubt the latter.  According to the private placement memorandum, ACAM has retained prominent service providers including Sidley Austin LLP (legal counsel), Ernst & Young (auditor), Continental Stock Transfer & Trust (transfer agent) and SecondMarket (marketplace, custodian and authorized participant).  Investors who purchase shares in the BIT will have the opportunity to gain liquidity through periodic auctions on SecondMarket beginning in 2014. The Net Asset Value (NAV) of the BIT will be calculated daily and made publicly available.
