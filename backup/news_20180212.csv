42401053,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLeyr,1518475841,JPMorgan Report: Crypto Could One Day Help Diversify Portfolios,"Cryptocurrencies could one day help investors diversify their equity and bond portfolios, analysts for JPMorgan Chase wrote in a new, 71-page research report focused on the tech.  The report, entitled ""Decrypting Cryptocurrencies: Technology, Applications and Challenges"" and dated Feb. 9, was drafted by the bank's Global Researchhttps://www.jpmorgan.com/global/cib/global-research/research unit. A copy obtained by CoinDesk explores a range of subjects related to cryptocurrency and blockchain, notably exploring the implications for investors, financial firms and central banks, among others.  Perhaps the most notable part of the report is that it – albeit cautiously – predicts that cryptocurrencies might one day play a role in the diversification of global bond and equity portfolios. The report states:  ""If past returns, volatilities and correlations persist, [cryptocurrencies] could potentially have a role in diversifying one's global bond and equity portfolio. But in our view, that is a big if given the astronomic returns and volatilities of the past few years.""  ""If [cryptocurrencies] survive the next few years and remain part of the global market, then they will likely have exited their current speculative phase and would then have more normal returns, volatilities (both much lower) and correlations (more like that of other zero-return assets such as gold and JPY),"" the authors continue.  That sentiment perhaps stands in contrast with comments from the bank's chairman, president and CEO, Jamie Dimon, who last year issued his now-infamous remark that bitcoin is a ""fraud."" As posited by the report's authors, cryptocurrencies are ""unlikely to disappear completely.""  ""[Cryptocurrencies] are unlikely to disappear completely and could easily survive in varying forms and shapes among players who desire greater decentralization, peer-to-peer networks and anonymity, even as the latter is under threat,"" they wrote.  Blockchain boon  Looking past the investment picture, the bank's report looks at the wider question of blockchain use, particularly by private firms who would maintain their own gated or ""permissioned"" blockchains.  The authors write that blockchain is a ""superior database,"" and that despite concerns from regulators, the tech itself is potentially ""regulation friendly.""  ""In our view, the biggest appeal of blockchain will be in the ability to deliver efficiency gains across the value chain,"" the report states, going on to explain:  ""The proposed uses a distributed ledger in the financial sector are likely to be based on known participants defined in advance, with appropriate KYC/AML documentation with tightly authorized access. Consequently, we believe that distributed ledger technology has the potential to offer regulators greater degrees of transparency, higher levels of resiliency and shorter settlement times, reducing counterparty and market risk.""  Likewise, the authors argued that blockchain has the potential to disrupt ""cross-border payments, settlement/clearing/collateral management as well as the broader world of TMT, transportation and healthcare."" That said, the report cautions that any benefits would be seen ""only where any cost efficiencies offset regulatory, technical and security hurdles"" to implementing the technology.  On central bank cryptos  The report also touches on the topic of a so-called ""Fedcoin,"" or a kind of cryptocurrency (or digital currency) created by a central bank.  And while Fed officials themselves have largely said ""no time soon"" to the idea (in contrast with other central banks who are actively investigating applications), JPMorgan's report digs into the possible implications – and ramifications – of such an issuance.  The report's authors make the case that, in one sense, a Fedcoin would be supportive of a ""central bank-provided payment services"" within a cashless system, and that this could help banks implement negative interest rates, which some economists endorse.  However, they also point out that the issuance of such a currency ""would give non-banks access to the Fed balance sheet,"" which could in turn ""endanger the economically and socially important financial intermediation function of commercial banks.""  Likewise, the authors claimed that a state-issued cryptocurrency could impact the extension of credit to the private sector because it would undermine fractional reserve banking, writing:  ""If cryptocurrencies were seen as superior to bank deposits, prompting a wholesale shift into cryptocurrencies, then a much larger share of savings would go to the central bank's assets (government debt) and less to commercial banks loans, thus potentially dramatically increasing private credit risk premia and reducing the flow of credit to the private sector.""  The report also grapples with the problem of anonymity for a state-issued cryptocurrency.  ""On the one hand, privacy has come to be seen as an implicit constitutional right, and that may extend to monetary transactions,"" the authors note. ""On the other hand, there are several laws on the books intended to prevent the financial system from being used to launder money or finance terrorism and other activities.""

42401035,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLek6,1518470126,BitConnect Lawsuits Are Piling Up In Florida,"Yet another lawsuit seeking class-action status has been filed in Florida against BitConnect, constituting the third legal action of its kind to be initiated in the state and the fifth overall in the U.S.  Florida residents Andrew Kline, Dusty Showers and Lena Hunt, along with Rhode Island resident Charles Mabra, filed the lawsuit in the U.S. District Court of the Middle District of Florida on Feb. 7, public records show. Additional suits have been filed in Minnesota and Kentucky.  Like the previous lawsuits filed in the past month, this one names Bitconnect’s various arms as defendants. Among the defendants cited in this instance are BitConnect director Glenn Arcaro and affiliate Ryan Maasen, as well as other unknown entities involved in the alleged Ponzi scheme.  The suit claims that BitConnect sold unregistered securities in the state and committed fraud by overstating the possible returns that users who purchased the BitConnect tokens would see. The plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants violated Florida trade and securities laws, as well as the applicable laws in Rhode Island.  The plaintiffs are seeking a jury trial, which would result in damages being levied against the defendants if they are successful. Proceeds would repay investors, as well as provide for the costs of the trial, according to the document.  Just last month, BitConnect saw its assets frozen after a previous lawsuit was filed by aggrieved investors. In the wake of the closure of BitConnect's lending platform, the price of its BCC token has fallen, tumbling from above $300 to roughly $2.90 as of press time.  In January, regulators in Texas and North Carolina moved against BitConnect ahead of a planned token sale, issuing cease-and-desist notices before the lending platform closure announcement later that month.

The company revealed last fall that it was devoting tens of millions of dollars to its mining venture, with the aim of building a site for pursuing the energy-intensive process by which new transactions are added to a blockchain and new coins are minted as a reward. With cloud mining, customers can purchase hashing power and receive the rewards of that process, minus any associated fees – though the model has long been associated with fraud, including companies that sell more processing power than they actually possess.  In a Feb. 9 announcement, GMO said that it would, beginning in March, hold a series of events in order to drum up interest in the service, which will feature two-year contracts for a whopping $5 million. Though the exact location of the GMO mine isn't publicly known, the facility is said to be based in northern Europe.  ""We have already been receiving inquiries about our cloud mining service, so from March 2018, GMO Internet will hold the information session in 9 cities to meet the needs of the companies or businesses worldwide who have announced their intention to participate in the cloud mining,"" the company said.  GMO described the August launch timeline as ""tentative.""  Notably, the firm will use some of the tokens mined at the facility for its GMO Coin exchange ""in order to ""contribute to an increase in diversity and liquidity of the cryptocurrency market.""  The Tokyo-based company has made a number of announcements related to the technology in recent months. These notably include a bitcoin-based payroll system, which it said would be made available to its own employees.

42422923,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qzXh,1518451819,3 EU Watchdogs Warn Over 'High Risks' of Crypto Investment,"Three European regulators with oversight over securities, banking and pensions issued a combined warning today to EU residents considering investing in cryptocurrencies.  Citing the crypto markets' volatility, lack of regulation and the potential for severe losses, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) wrote a brief note warning investors of the ""high risks of buying and/or holding so-called virtual currencies.""  Collectively referred to as the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs), the regulators state there is a ""high risk"" that investors will lose all of their funds if they choose to invest in cryptocurrencies, specifically noting that there is an apparent bubble in the markets currently.  They continued, writing:  ""VCs [virtual currencies] and exchanges where consumers can trade are not regulated under EU law, which means that consumers buying VCs do not benefit from any protection associated with regulated financial services. For example, if a VC exchange goes out of business or consumers have their money stolen because their VC account is subject to a cyber-attack; there is no EU law that would cover their losses.""  The warning explicitly mentions bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin and XRP, while further noting that other cryptocurrencies are often sold without any information explaining their background or the risks in purchasing them.  Part of the risk, the ESAs claim, arises from difficulty purchasing or selling cryptocurrencies due to transaction delays. Users may purchase some amount of a cryptocurrency at a specific price, but network congestion means they could receive a smaller amount at a higher price, they say.  For residents who still want to invest in cryptocurrencies, the note recommends understanding the characteristics of the token being sold and not investing more than they can afford to lose. In addition, users should take steps to keep their digital wallets secure.  The warning comes amid increasing noise within the EU over the crypto market, its perceived risks and potential regulation.  The ESMA said last week that cryptocurrencies will be one of its top priorities in 2018, while, a day later, senior officials from France and Germany called for the G20 group of nations to discuss cooperative action on cryptocurrencies ahead of a summit next month.  At the same time, European Central Bank (ECB) executive board member Yves Mersch aired concerns over the apparent ""gold rush"" in the crypto markets, adding that a regulatory solution may be to force unregulated exchanges to report transactions.

Speaking with Associated Press, Smari McCarthy of the Icelandic Pirate Party floated the idea during an interview about the country's global position as a hub for bitcoin miners.  Iceland has long played home to an ecosystem of bitcoin miners, thanks to the country's access to abundant sources of geothermal power and Arctic air, the latter of which is key for keeping the power-hungry mining hardware cool without added electricity costs.  ""Under normal circumstances, companies that are creating value in Iceland pay a certain amount of tax to the government,"" McCarthy was quoted as saying. ""These companies are not doing that, and we might want to ask ourselves whether they should.""  The Pirate Party currently holds 6 seats out of 63 in the Althing, Iceland's parliament, meaning that the party alone is unlikely to succeed in pursuing any kind of bitcoin mining tax on its own.  As the article notes, however, interest in the idea might gain traction among lawmakers of other parties if demand for the nation's cheap electricity continues to increase.  One power industry representative told AP, ""Just today, I came from a meeting with a mining company seeking to buy 18 megawatts.""  McCarthy told the news service:  ""We are spending tens or maybe hundreds of megawatts on producing something that has no tangible existence and no real use for humans outside the realm of financial speculation.

42401044,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLery,1518444003,Cryptos Go Green as Market Cap Holds Above $400 Billion,"The cryptocurrency markets have begun the week on a positive note, with the total market capitalization of all currencies consolidating above the $400 billion mark.  Sellers reigned supreme a week ago, before better-than-expected Senate hearings calmed market nerves and once more boosted demand for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin (BTC), the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, jumped to $9,070.64 over the weekend and was last seen trading at around $8,800.  Other crypto leaders followed suit and, as a result, the total value of the market – which had hit a 10-week low of $276 billion on Feb. 6 – steadily recovered in the subsequent days.  The market cap rose to $458 billion on Saturday – the highest since Feb. 2 – according to data source CoinMarketCap. After a dip yesterday below $400 billion, the figure is back around $430 billion at press time – down 6 percent from the weekend high.  However, despite having recovered 55 percent from the February low, the market cap is still down $400 billion from the record high of $830 billion set in January.  Looking at the individual markets, IOTA is the top gainer on a 24-hour basis (up 12.59 percent) among the top 10 currencies, but ranks second (-46.48 percent) on the list of top losers on a year-to-date (YTD) basis.  Despite having rallied 86 percent from its Feb. 6 low of $0.58836, Ripple's XRP token is still the worst performing top-10 currency on a year-to-date basis (YTD) – down 52.17 percent.  Meanwhile, ethereum's native currency, ether (ETH), is up 15.29 percent on a YTD basis. Though impressive, the ether bulls still have a plenty work to do, given the cryptocurrency is still down 39 percent from the record high of $1,432.88 hit on Jan. 13.  Also notable, Stellar's XLM token is up 8.71 percent in the last 24 hours, and reporting 11 percent gains on YTD terms.

In a news report published Feb. 12, the Xinhua News Agency detailed how purchasing cryptocurrency assets through OTC channels is easily available by having reporters register on exchanges such as Huobi Pro and buy bitcoin using accessible payment tools like AliPay.  As reported previously, following the ban on ICO and closure of order-book trading platforms last year, the country's domestic exchange platforms have shifted to OTC trading and largely moved their businesses overseas.  Yet, the new report by Xinhua, a ministry-level institution under the Chinese central government, notably arrives at a time when Chinese authorities are continuing to signal a desire to tighten rules to curb existing trading activities in the country.  Citing a report published by a Chinese internet finance security commission, the news agency stressed that as of November last year, more than 20 OTC exchanges have remained active through overseas domains such as Hong Kong, Japan and the U.S.  In addition, the report also pointed out crypto-to-crypto trading platforms that are based outside mainland China but available for Chinese investors, alleging that all these actions should be considered attempts to bypass the existing regulations.  Furthermore, it highlighted how some ICOs have shifted their registration overseas.  ""Currently, some ICO projects moved overseas to continue its operation.

42401040,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLep1,1518440430,Into the Dark Pool: $30 Million ICO Could Pave Way for Huge Crypto Trades,"The term dark pool might sound ominous, but investors think building one could prove to be a boon for the crypto market.  Announced today, Republic Protocol has officially completed an initial coin offering (ICO) for its REN token, raising 35,000 ether (roughly $30.5 million at current prices) from lead investors Polychain Capital and FBG, as well as funds like Huobi Capital, Hyperchain Capital and Signal Ventures.  Along with retail investors, the participants above are betting big on a way to execute large trades without spooking the market. At least, that's the argument advanced by Taiyang Zhang, CEO of Republic Protocol, who sees the project as a trustless alternative system for crypto trading.  Zhang told CoinDesk:  ""One of the biggest problems is there is a huge price slippage with any of these cryptocurrencies, especially when you are trying to trade large amounts.""  In other words, if a whale goes to move an unusually large quantity of bitcoin or ether today, that sell order will likely hit an exchange or a broker, thereby inspiring other traders to start selling as well. If the trade ends up getting broken into pieces over time, the market will start seeing those large sales, and it will drive the price down even further.  Not only does this contribute to general volatility, but it means the whale's last trades go for significantly less than the earlier ones. This is, of course, non-optimal, especially for investors. So, it's little wonder that major crypto investors would be eager to find a solution.  In total, Polychain and other large investors picked up 60.2 percent of the total supply of 1 billion REN tokens. Roughly 15 percent were set aside for the team, advisors and early partners, with another 5 percent set aside to build the community. (Republic Protocol has 19.9 percent in a reserve to provide liquidity in the early days.)  This is notable, as participants in the network will need REN to pay nodes and run the computations that find trading partners. Nodes will need to stake REN to guarantee non-malicious behavior.  For the whales  Stepping back, Republic's platform will allow traders to send very detailed parameters to the dark pool about the trades they would like to make.  The pool will then break trades up into pieces and either find the best trades that meet those parameters or boot the trade back out if the terms can't be met – all without the wider world ever knowing the full details of what the trader was willing to do.  So, for example, someone could say that they had 1,000 ETH that they wanted to sell for between 0.095 and 0.125 BTC, and the sale could close providing it found partners for at least 80 percent of positions within 24 hours.  The process uses something called Shamir's Secret Sharing, a cryptographic algorithm for splitting up a reconstructable secret, to divide the orders into parts and share them out to nodes on the Republic platform.  ""I think what's really important is it's provable that no one can see inside this dark pool at all,"" Zhang said, not even his own team. ""There's no information asymmetry. Everyone gets the same information.""  Using multi-party computation, the nodes find the best possible trading partners within the bounds of the order. It's designed so that all anyone can ever know is the details of the final trades, but it still won't reveal either party's total offer (such as how low they might have gone, or how much they would have been willing to buy at a given price).  ""Where a dark pool could be very handy is, instead of negotiating prices or even trusting OTC (over-the-counter) brokers, it's a way to place an order trustlessly,"" Zhang said.  If the criteria are met, the orders would be settled among the relevant parties using peer-to-peer atomic swaps.  A lot of attention has been paid to cross-blockchain trades using atomic swaps in recent months. For Republic, it functions as a settlement layer, but that part of the system ends up being one of the simpler parts.  For the big orders, ""a lot of times people are not expecting it to happen instantly,"" Zhang said. So it's not a problem to move the currencies into smart contracts that trade directly between wallets.  For the minnows  So, Republic can help out the whales who want to move big positions and don't want to see $20,000 shaved off their net profit, but won't the final sale have roughly the same effect on market?  Zhang admits we can't really know until the platform is live, and that it can be argued both ways, but his company has been studying the issue.  ""We do have a paper coming out on the impact of price exchanges,"" he said.  And there are some real-world examples to look at. In the stock market, there are estimates that something like one-seventh of all trading happens on alternative trading systems.  ""What we find is it does impact the LIT exchanges but it doesn't impact them nearly as much,"" Zhang said. By ""LIT exchange,"" he means one where the full order is transparent, the sort of trade where a retail or more modest traders will be active.  This could simply be psychological. It's one thing to see a big trade execute all at once, but another to watch a giant, looming order sitting there on the books, waiting to close. Instead, with this system, a trader looks up and a giant trade is just done. They never saw the spread offered. They never sat there watching the price fall as it went through. It's just over.  If Zhang's thesis about the pool quelling volatility proves correct, it should benefit traders even if they never move volumes large enough to use Republic. That's because fewer big price swings will mean fewer margin calls for leveraged trades.  Furthermore, the market will have time to adjust to the dark pool before it reaches its full trading potential, because when the platform hits the mainnet in Q3 2018 as planned, it's likely to be missing a key feature: a seamless way to move from crypto to fiat.  ""We are working to see which partners we can bring in on this, but that's the real pain point,"" Zhang granted. The most obvious solution is ""stablecoin,"" one that people can really trust to trade smoothly with fiat at a consistent rate. There's not one on the books to do that yet, however.  Nevertheless, the pre-sale met with what the company has called ""overwhelming interest,"" suggesting that major crypto asset holders see uses for the platform with or without a way to trustlessly trade into fiat.  As Gordon Chen, a partner at FBG Capital, said in a press release:  ""We couldn't wait to be the pioneer user of Republic Protocol and help expand this alternative liquidity network.""

Lagarde, who is the managing director of the international organization that aims to foster global financial stability, said that the IMF's concerns over cryptocurrencies stem largely from their potential use in illicit financial activities.  In an interview with CNNMoney on Feb. 11, she said:  ""We are actively engaging in anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism. And that reinforces our determination to work on those two directions.""  Lagarde further explained that the regulatory direction should be activity-based, focusing on ""who is doing what, and whether they're properly licensed and supervised.""  While the new comments are largely in line with Lagarde's already public views on cryptocurrency, it indicates the IMF may be moving to be more actively involved in preventing the illicit use of cryptocurrency.  On multiple occasions, Lagarde has previously cautioned that cryptocurrencies should be taken seriously and called for global cooperation among worldwide regulators. And she is not alone in voicing concerns over use of cryptocurrency in cross-border financial crimes.  According to an earlier report by CoinDesk, during the Davos World Economic Forum in late January, several worldwide leaders shared the same sentiment, including the U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May, French President Emmanuel Macron and the secretary of the U.S. Treasury Department Steven Mnuchin.

According to BBC, the incident was first revealed after British security researcher Scott Helme, who raised the alarm that users browsing the website of the U.K. Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) are affected by the malware, dubbed Coinhive, which illicitly mines the anonymous cryptocurrency Monero.  The ICO subsequently closed its website when the issue was revealed, the report indicates. At press time, the site was still down, citing ""maintenance.""  The BBC said the malware spread after having compromised a website plug-in service named Browsealoud, which is used to help blind or partially sighted users access website content.  According to the report, the maker of the plug-in, Texthelp, confirmed that its product was breached for four hours by the mining malware. Helme said the malware had now been disabled.  In addition to the ICO website, the report said other British sites are also affected, including the Student Loans Company and Barnsley Hospital, as well as thousands of others worldwide.  According to another report from Australian news source ABC.net, several government sites in Queensland, as well as the Victorian Parliament, also appeared to have been affected.

The FSRA now notes its concerns over the issues of cryptocurrencies being used in money laundering and terrorist financing, as well as the risk of cyberattacks. Like its counterparts in other countries and regions such as Japan, the EU and Singapore, the FSRA said it's also exploring a framework to supervise cryptocurrency exchanges regarding these risks.  According to the statement, the agency does plan to include advisory input from industry companies and relevant professional bodies.  The FSRA further cautions that before the regulatory framework is in place, investors and exchanges are advised to approach the agency for discussion on proper treatment of cryptocurrency transactions.  The news comes just a week after the United Arab Emirates' securities regulator issued a warning to residents on the risk of investing in token-based fundraising activities.

42401058,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLf2n,1518429023,Bullish Signs Above $8K: Has Bitcoin Turned the Corner?,"Bitcoin clocked six-day highs above $9,000 over the weekend, but a long-term bull market revival may not be on the cards, yet.  Having clocked a high of $9,070.64 on Saturday, prices again fell back below $8,000 briefly on Sunday before climbing again. CoinDesks's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) was last seen at $8,772.  The cryptocurrency has appreciated by 9.70 percent in the last 24 hours, as per data source CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin (BTC) is also close to 40 percent above last week's low of $5,947.40.  So has the cryptocurrency bottomed out?  To start with, the sharp recovery from lows below $6,000 does indicate a short-term bottom is in place. However, BTC is still down 39 percent on a year-to-date basis. Further, the series of lower highs as represented by the falling trendline is still intact.  While, BTC has a history of rallying to fresh record highs after the relative strength index (RSI) has bottomed out at, or below, 30.00 (oversold region), the daily chart throws some doubt on that pattern today.  Daily chart  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows:  Throughout the uptrend from Aug 2015 to Dec 2017, the RSI fell to (or below) 30.00 on four occasions (marked by circles). And, in March 2017, the RSI bottomed out just above 30.00. Each time, BTC went on to clock fresh record highs.  The RSI has never formed a double bottom or turned sideways around 30.00. It has always been a ""v"" shaped recovery for the RSI.  The situation today looks similar. The RSI has recovered sharply from below 30.00 and BTC is up close to 40 percent from lows below $6,000. So, going by the historical pattern, BTC should rise to fresh record highs above $20,000.  However, the weekly chart indicates it will be easier said than done.  Weekly chart  The above chart shows:  At no time were the bears strong enough to push the RSI below 53.00 (strong support marked by a horizontal line). Moreover, the 80.00–90.00 range has marked the tops, while the 53.00–55.00 support zone has marked all the pullbacks in the bull market (August 2015 to December 2017).  However, the support zone of 53.00–55.00 has been breached this time and, as of writing, the RSI is seen below 50.00 (bearish territory).  Further, the 5-week moving average (MA) and 10-week MA witnessed a bearish crossover in late January and are now sloping downwards in favor of the bears.  Hence, the historical pattern may not occur this time round. That said, BTC seems to have found a short-term bottom, as indicated by the sharp recovery from the lows around $6,000.  View  BTC could test the $10,000 mark in the short-run as the RSI on the 1-hour and 4-hour chart is rising and well short of the overbought region (above 70.00), but a rally to record highs (in line with the historical pattern) looks unlikely.  The cryptocurrency may find it hard to hold on to gains above $10,000, courtesy of the bearish setup on the weekly chart. Rejection at the downward sloping weekly 5-MA and 10-MA could trigger a fresh wave of selling.  On the downside, a daily close below $7,724.9 (Feb. 9 low) would add credence to bearish weekly chart and could yield a drop to $5,000.

42401047,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLevu,1518426022,T-Mobile's Blockchain Work Is Quietly Coming Together,"T-Mobile has been quietly toiling away on an enterprise blockchain solution for months, and it looks primed to make a big reveal soon.  The telecom giant's interest in blockchain was most recently advanced after the company was prominently mentioned for its role in helping develop Hyperledger Sawtooth's 1.0 version. Yet, its overarching blockchain work is not widely known.  And while details are still being kept under lock and key, Chris Spanton, the senior architect of T-Mobile's Hyper Directory, a blockchain proof-of-concept (PoC) that was quietly unveiled in November, told CoinDesk several milestones are in the works.  Each, he said, fits into the company's larger push to take advantage of open-source software.  Hyper Directory, for instance, uses Hyperledger Sawtooth to control who gets access to which T-Mobile cloud-based solutions, a process called identity and access management, or IAM.  Spanton toured the progress made on the directory at Amazon's Re:Invent event in Las Vegas in December, presenting on how blockchain can improve security and cut costs for enterprises.  In interview with CoinDesk, he added:  ""Creating Hyper Directory solved core IAM use cases we had in our cloud infrastructure, and building it as a blockchain solution provided unique opportunities to push forward our deep technical expertise.""  Open to open-source  A closer look at some of the publicly available information on Hyper Directory provides some valuable insight into how it might fit into T-Mobile's big picture.  In Spanton's first article on Hyper Directory, he described the PoC as a reaction to ""several unique pain points"" he had experienced helping T-Mobile scale its cloud solutions to large enterprises. Specifically, the directory is being designed to address concerns over who has access to do what in the cloud, when those permissions are active, who grants those permissions and how this can all be done without increasing complexity.  ""How do we solve the 'who is watching the watchers' problem of auditing change management?"" Spanton asked in the post.  Spanton then went on to describe a system of smart contracts that approves and distributes permissions via an API layer on top of the Hyperledger Sawtooth blockchain.  As part of that interoperability, the cloud permissioning directory is specifically being designed to integrate with some of T-Mobile's other open-source software.  Originally it was designed with the company's recently launched open-source Jazz platform, meant to develop cloud computing platforms without the need of a centralized server, in mind.  But upon closer look at T-Mobile's other open-source projects, a number of other possible integrations become apparent. In addition to Jazz, T-Mobile is working on a project called Keybiner, described in the Github repository as a library that tokenizes a user's authority to perform transactions.  While it remains to be seen how these projects might eventually overlap, its clear that not only is T-Mobile increasingly serious about open-source software, but more specifically, blockchain.  Communications competition  And the reason behind this interest, could, in fact, be competitive edge.  Last year, a number of blockchain patents were awarded to potential telecommunications competitors, including Comcast and British Telecommunications PLC. And an earlier project by Scandinavian telecommunications giant Telenor looked into the possibility of one of its partners launching an initial coin offering (ICO).  As T-Mobile continues to battle for market share, building an open-source way for any cloud computing company to grant and rescind permissions could give it an upper hand in attracting valuable early partners.  The wireless carrier, which currently has 69 million subscribers, has added at least 1 million subscribers per month for an 18 month period ending in October, and has spent $8 billion on new wireless spectrum.  As such, Spanton told CoinDesk:  ""While blockchain has been a relatively new space for T-Mobile, developing game-changing solutions to old problems is not.""

42401046,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLesx,1518422443,CME to Patent System for Seamless Blockchain Rule Changes,"CME Group may be looking at ways for developers to modify a blockchain's rules without requiring consensus from all of the network's nodes, new patent filings show.  It's a key need for such systems, such as those that form part of airline reward points programs and other applications in which a blockchain is used to store and maintain information in real time, the application's authors write. The filing was published last Thursday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), having been submitted in December 2016.  CME cites airline frequent flyer programs as one example of where this system would be needed. If an airline chooses to store its frequent flyer customer data on a public blockchain, it would need to have a process in place to change the rules governing the blockchain in case the airline changes the rules or another aspect of the frequent flyer program itself.  The application notes that while public blockchains are important for cryptocurrencies, their difficult-to-change nature makes them less than ideal for some private and commercial uses.  The application explains:  ""One example of a rule change is if the airline wants to increase transaction fees to transfer airline miles between parties. If the airline uses an open blockchain protocol like Bitcoin, where anyone may act as a node or miner, the increase in transaction fees would have to be approved by the blockchain users. The rule change would require virtually every node and miner to update their software before the rule change could take effect. Otherwise, a fork … may occur.""  The filing represents the latest blockchain-related intellectual property bid for the derivatives giant. Indeed, CME's past patent filings suggest how the company might look to use the tech to store and manage transaction data in connection with trading venues.

42401039,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLem4,1518411626,"Funny Name or Not, Schnorr Is a Big Deal for Bitcoin","""To the moon!""  While this cryptocurrency rallying cry is typically used as the price of a coin starts a climb, this time the slogan's being used to demonstrate excitement over the progress that's being made on a long-anticipated bitcoin code optimization.  Called Schnorr signatures, the technology looks to replace bitcoin's existing signature scheme with one that mashes signature data together. The concept is so attractive partly because it clears up space in the blockchain, which should help resolve both the transaction backlog and high fees bitcoin users sometimes need to deal with.  According to developers working on the technology, the change would lead to an estimated 25 percent to 30 percent boost in bitcoin's transaction capacity.  Yannick Seurin, a cryptographer at French cybersecurity agency ANSSI, who's been working on the cryptography behind Schnorr, told CoinDesk:  ""Schnorr signatures and the applications they enable generate high hopes. As evidenced by the recent scaling debate, any efficiency improvement is highly beneficial to bitcoin.""  Indeed, the bitcoin community has united around several technologies to make bitcoin more efficient, and as such, cheaper, faster and easier to use for payments. Schnorr is just one of many, joining FIBRE network, peer-to-peer optimizations, and, the most ambitious of all, the upcoming Lightning Network.  But Schnorr has recently become the focus of some of bitcoin's most renowned developers.  This is not only due to Segregated Witness (SegWit) being activated on bitcoin finally (a technology Schnorr relies on) but also the other benefits Schnorr signatures offer, like improving privacy on certain types of transactions and reducing spam known to clog up the network.  Jonas Nick, for example, told CoinDesk he's interested in the privacy advantages, no surprise for the Blockstream infrastructure security engineer. Yet, he's also enticed by how it could work hand in hand with other code changes to unlock more advanced bitcoin use cases.  ""I'm particularly excited to work towards the goal where smart contracts look like normal payments on chain. Schnorr signatures play a crucial role there, along with MAST, Taproot and Graftroot,"" Nick said, referring to a number of changes geared towards enhancing bitcoin's smart contracts.  Subtle attacks  This excitement over Schnorr has been a long-time coming – the technology has been in development since 2012.  While that might seem curious to some, for those close to the technology, these delays won't be surprising. Firstly, there aren't many developers that know bitcoin and cryptography well enough to help with a change such as Schnorr.  And secondly, since Schnorr would be a big change to the over $100 billion dollar bitcoin network, the technology needs extensive peer review and testing.  Both definitely slowed Schnorr's progress.  According to celebrated bitcoin contributor and Blockstream co-founder Pieter Wuille, during a talk at Stanford, Schnorr has dealt with several ""non-obvious challenges"" over the years.  For instance, last year Wuille and other developers found a ""rogue attack"" in their Schnorr implementation, leading them to submit a paper outlining a possible fix. But, the academic board the paper was submitted to, flatly rejected it, pointing to a better paper – albeit unrelated to bitcoin – that already addressed the attack vector in a more secure way.  And this is how ANSSI cryptographer Seurin become involved with the bitcoin developers.  ""I noticed that the specific signature aggregation scheme they were thinking of didn't have a proper security analysis at the time,"" he said. ""As provable security is my specific research area, and I previously worked on Schnorr signatures, I contacted Pieter Wuille.""  Wuille then sent Seurin the paper, and together with Bitcoin Core contributor Gregory Maxwell and Blockstream mathematician Andrew Poelstra, wrote a more secure construction.  And while that construction helped, another problem appeared a bit later.  Another attack vector was found by Blockstream engineer Russell O'Connor (Wuille dubbed it ""Russell's attack""), which would allow users to steal bitcoin that was transacted with the signature theme.  During the presentation, Wuille said:  ""So something to learn about this, at least for myself, is that attack models in multi-party schemes can be very subtle. This was not at all obvious.""  Process and politics  Those attack vectors are resolved, but work on the technology continues.  Several Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) are in the works, Wuille told the audience at the talk. And once those are finished, it'll provide blueprints for how the new signature scheme works and how exactly it would be added to bitcoin. Plus other bitcoin contributors will then have a chance to review and propose changes to the implementations.  Not to mention, a code implementation is long in the making, which Nick said have been fuzz testing for quite some time. Fuzz testing refers to the act of throwing random data at a piece of code and checking whether the output always comes back correct.  ""Since you do that many hundreds of times per second on many cores for an extended period of time, [fuzz testing] has historically a good track record of finding subtle bugs,"" Nick told CoinDesk, adding:  ""We haven't found an issue ... yet strengthening our confidence in the implementation.""  If that remains the case, Schnorr code shouldn't take so long, according to Wuille.  In his talk, Wuille said, ""Ignoring politics, it's not so hard to add an opcode by way of SegWit's script versioning.""  Yet, as the controversy surrounding the activation of SegWit displayed, politics might be a hard thing to ignore.  Either way, the code change has seen a lot of attention recently, developers have been writing explainer blog posts and a number of people have been chatting about it on Reddit.  But, with billions of dollars on the line, if an upgrade messes up the way bitcoin works (case in point, the attack vectors mentioned above), the majority of stakeholders might be hesitant about adding to the code quickly.  Bitcoin Core contributor Nicolas Dorier, for one, estimates that it could still take a couple years to get Schnorr added to bitcoin.  And even Wuille, during the presentation, conceded this timeline may be necessary.  He concluded:  ""I would like to see what we've been working on here merged into bitcoin, but that's a lengthy process.""
