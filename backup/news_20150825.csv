42426473,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJsxTh,1440540770,Bitcoin Micropayment Service Targets Global Freelancers,"A new bitcoin micropayments tool has launched to take aim at the global freelance and on-demand services market.  Called Faradam (after inventor Michael Faraday), the service uses a simple timer to facilitate payment between two parties, with freelancers seeking to leverage the service only needing to provide their name, hourly work rate and bitcoin address. In turn, those looking to employ short-term services simply receive a link and connect a wallet.  Created by former Quasar Ventures senior business analyst Demian Brener; engineer Esteban Ordano; and Manuel Araoz, the developer behind decentralized verification project Proof of Existence, the three founders are currently based in Argentina.  Unsurprisingly given its high bitcoin adoption rates, it's in this region where Brener believes Faradam could have the biggest impact, telling CoinDesk:  ""What we're now doing is focusing mainly on use cases where people have bitcoin like international freelancers, and they charge their clients in bitcoin. In Argentina, we don't have a PayPal, it's really hard to charge for freelance services from the US.""  While a novel use case for micropayments, the technology underlying the service is not new, having been created by Brener for Streamium, his decentralized video streaming project launched in May.  Brener explained that Faradam was inspired by Streamium users, who saw that the ability to charge for services rather than content would be broadly useful. He indicated he now sees that project as a proof of concept for what could be a variety of more commercial use cases.  ""The value of what we did lies not in the livestream video, but the metered payment infrastructure,"" he continued. ""This lets you charge in real time for on-demand services.""  Brener went on to suggest Faradam will focus on bitcoin users in ""niche markets"", before adding other payment methods depending on the product's use.  Faradam charges 1% for all payment sessions facilitated on the service, a contrast to Streamium's free, open-source model. The company does not currently plan to enter an incubator.  Design influence  Brener indicated that Faradam was also inspired by Streamium's design, specifically the need for it to streamline the interface for novice bitcoin users.  ""We know it's a complicated concept, payment channels and bitcoin, so we worked really, really hard on doing the site very simple so people could grasp it and understand it as soon as possible,"" Brener said.  To break down the design to simple elements, Brener talked with Streamium users, including online teachers and professional psychologists, who had sought to leverage its metered video payments as a way to earn income.  ""We finished the Faradam project a week ago, and we shared it with our champions, our early adopters, freelancers, teachers and consultants who use it with their clients,"" he continued. ""Today it's a simple product to use and you can grasp it right away.""  Built as a web application, Brener said Faradam can be used in conjunction with popular communication apps such as Skype or Slack.  ""It's independent of how you provide the service, you don't depend on a webcam or live streaming application,"" he said. ""You turn the switch on and money starts flowing right away.""

42426471,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJsxRh,1440532821,Why Symbiont Believes Blockchain Securities Are Wall Street's Future,"Spurred by private conferences and high-profile investments from leading Wall Street firms, interest in blockchain applications in the capital markets has become a driving trend in 2015.  This year has already seen US stock market giant Nasdaq and online retailer Overstock announce or launch products aimed at bringing the efficiencies of the blockchain to certain sectors of the market, most prominently private equities. Among these two household names, however, is another, newer entrant: New York-based Symbiont.  Though it lacks the name recognition, Symbiont is building its own buzz, having raised $1.25m in June with backing from former NYSE CEO Duncan Niederauer. Further, its team may have the most experience in blockchain applications among its peers, as it boasts Robbie Dermody, Evan Wagner and Adam Krellenstein, the developers behind Counterparty, a protocol that allows the bitcoin blockchain to be used for asset trading, on its roster.  Symbiont launched its first blockchain-based private security earlier this month, converting its founders' shares, convertible preferred shares and convertible note terms to function on the blockchain. Though it made the headlines, less clear was how the firm will seek to develop this 'smart securities' technology into a market strategy.  In a new interview, however, Symbiont CEO Mark Smith opened up on the firm and its market strategy, suggesting that the private equities market will be its main focus. The FX trading veteran and founder of early E*Trade alternative MatchBookFX called a robust private securities market ""the only future"" given that many startups are avoiding public offerings.  Smith told CoinDesk:  ""You look at companies like Uber in Series K or Series N rounds, the allure of going public isn't what it used to be.""  Putting shares in private companies on the blockchain, according to Smith, provides a perfect proof of concept for the technology's capital markets applications.  ""What can be done then is transfers to other securities. Because we did straight equity and debt, we demonstrated you can do a bond on the bitcoin blockchain and then you can do it on a permissioned ledger system,"" Smith continued.  Beyond private equities, Smith sees opportunities in the corporate bond market, where intermediaries connect sellers looking for debt investments and companies seeking to raise short-term capital for business objectives. Also cited was the syndicated loans market, where groups of lenders work to provide funds for single borrower, thereby spreading out the risk associated with a potential default.  Under the hood  While the tech sounds impressive, CTO Adam Krellenstein was able to break down the sometimes heavy advertising language employed by the firm to discuss what differentiates its ""smart securities"" from other blockchain assets.  Krellenstein indicated that Symbiont has created its own ""full-featured smart contract language"" that works with bitcoin using embedded consensus, and that was built from the ground up to be transferable to other blockchains.  ""We have a smart securities system, it's a layer on top of bitcoin, it encodes execution data and publication data in transactions, publishing to the blockchain, so all the data is on the bitcoin blockchain,"" Krellenstein said.  With this developed, he continued, Symbiont is now focusing on developing its front end and APIs, which will seek to enable its clients to use the technology on their own. Krellenstein suggested this technology was different from token-based systems, such as those in use at Overstock's tØ platform.  ""They are using colored coins on top of bitcoin to represent assets that are stored and issued and traded offchain,"" Krellenstein asserted. ""Symbiont's system is smart securities, so you're issuing and managing the securities all on the chain itself.""  Krellenstein sought to categorize tokens as ""old technology"" that didn't offer the level of sophistication of its smart securities project. At issue is his contention that the entirety of a contract needs to be replicated on the blockchain for an asset on a blockchain to function as a financial instrument.  This would mean that a bond, for example, could have built-in coupon payments that are represented on the blockchain itself.  ""The whole point of doing settlement and clearing is that you can use the blockchain as a ledger to represent ownership, but if you can't replicate this on chain you aren't anywhere, you haven't reached your goal,"" he said, adding that token systems can be created inside smart contract systems, but that this doesn't work both ways.  Symbiont, according to Smith, currently has 14 employees, 12 of which are engineers. Employees are divided into three teams, focused on cryptocurrency, FinTech and web development.  Bad blood  In the interview, Smith also opened up for the first time about the relationship between current Symbiont employees, developers Robby Dermody and Evan Wagner, and their former employer, tØ.com, the capital markets-focused project spearheaded by Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne.  Smith hinted at the messier parts of the split, suggesting that Dermody and Wagner found that no members of the tØ team ""had any experience"", a realization that led them to reach back out to Smith and his firm at the time, Math Money, regarding a potential collaboration.  Dermody and Wagner's exit was first revealed by CoinDesk in February, with both sides suggesting the split was amicable and made for business purposes. However, Smith's comments suggest the partnership, announced in October, was more short-lived than originally indicated by the parties.  ""Evan and Robbie came to the same conclusion that [Overstock] wasn't the right decision for them before they even started to work for Medici,"" he said.  Overstock confirmed that Dermody and Wagner never participated in the Medici project, now tØ, adding that ""nobody"" had experience in the space at the point it was developing solutions in response to the comments.  Smith implied he doesn't believe the companies will be rivals, suggesting both firms are attacking different parts of the market. ""Overstock is a broker-dealer. They want to do publicly traded stock and want to use colored coins and Open Assets as their protocol,"" Smith said. ""They have haven't said anything about smart contracts other than equities.""  Still, he stemmed further dialogue on the subject, adding:  ""I think everyone's doing something interesting but no one's doing what we're doing financial instruments and smart contracts on distributed ledgers.""  Overstock has not commented publicly on its technology, stating only that it is ""blockchain agnostic"".  Uber opportunity  While broadly applicable, Smith now framed the private equities market as one that will continue to benefit from the company's smart securities first. Here, Smith sees this as a large built-in market that doesn't exist in the public equities space, as well as more regulatory room.  For instance, he believes blockchain solutions will find a niche reducing the need for startups to manage complex capital tables.  ""VCs have huge portfolios,"" he said. ""Just converting what already exists today would be a herculean effort, it's a huge number.""  For this market, Smith argued smart securities are necessary, as traditional tokens can't be created with the ability to restrict transfer according to the agreed terms.  Over time, he theorized that demand is likely to increase as technological advances like crowdfunding.  ""Think about the number of investors going to be in crowdfunded deals, think about what your cap table is going to look like,"" he continued. ""There are some guys doing this in the cloud, but the blockchain provides cap table management for all different things.""  Pure tech play  When asked about the firm's regulatory strategy, Smith was quick to state that he believes Symbiont to be a ""pure technology company"", one that will seek to work with existing financial solutions to develop blockchain solutions.  ""We don't want to disintermediate financial institutions, but allow them to deliver products and services better. We want to be trusted and transparent to enter into new markets to shift models away from models where there is high risk,"" Smith continued.  To this end, Krellenstein said the company will seek to build a ""fully peer-to-peer network with no middleman"", providing only technology and software. The strategy stands in contrast to one being pursued by itBit via its bankchain project, which it argues will benefit from its banking relationships by enabling cash settlement.  Symbiont has not applied for a BitLicense in New York, but suggested it is in talks with FINRA and the SEC to ensure its compliance.  ""We don't touch fiat or crypto, we don't money transfer,"" Smith said. ""Our customer is responsible for KYC and AML that they sponsor onto our permissioned network. We're never a counterparty for a trade, we never custody a currency fiat or crypto.""  As for the competition, Smith indicated that he sees this as a sign the firms involved are innovating in the right direction. For example, he lauded Eris Industries and Digital Asset Holdings as companies seeking different enterprise uses for smart contracts and blockchains, concluding:  ""I'd hate to be the only person working on something.""

42426462,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJsx9h,1440526521,Indian Central Bankers Go Public With Bitcoin Views,"The Reserve Bank of India's governor and two deputy governors made statements about bitcoin during gatherings earlier this month, comments that hint at the ongoing regulatory debate in the region.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) deputy governor Shri R Gandhi’s 25th August speech at the FIBAC 2015 banking conference in Mumbai focused on technological disruption and financial inclusion.  Toward the end of his speech Gandhi addressed two subjects - cryptocurrencies and crowdfunding. While he said the technologies have the potential to be disruptive, he was quick to note they could also have undesirable consequences if left unchecked.  Gandhi said:  ""Digital currencies and crowdfunding have the potential to support criminal, anti-social activities like money laundering, terrorist funding and tax evasion. While we do not have any reported instances of crowdfunding in this respect, cryptocurrencies have been widely suspected to finance criminal activities. We have to be carefully and critically watching these developments.”  Acknowledging that the technology can assist financial inclusion, Gandhi went on to say that cryptocurrency can help alleviate transaction settlement concerns.  India’s government disclosed last year that the RBI was exploring digital currencies. Back in December 2013, the bank issued a warning on the subject and stated it was beginning to investigate the technology.  Additional comments  In separate comments, deputy governor Subhash Sheoratan Mundra, reports India’s The Economic Times, suggested that global coordination among regulators is needed to address the volatility and crime-related risks of digital currencies.  ""These are the kinds of global innovations and by very nature and design.....it will be something which would need a global coordination rather than a framework which can be location specific,” Mundra said, according to the source.  These comments come days after RBI governor Raghuram Rajam remarked on the central bank’s policy toward digital currencies.  Speaking at an event hosted by State Bank of India, Rajam said that more investigation is necessary before the central bank decides to take any action, according to a report by The Financial Express.  ""We have to examine and I would say we shouldn't intervene strongly until we understand it better,"" he said. ""But we have to watch it, which means we have to be much more active in gathering market intelligence and in situation where it is clear that it is illegal, to bring it to the notice of law enforcement authorities.""

42426454,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJswzh,1440503747,MIT Course 'to Inspire Next Generation of Bitcoin CEOs',"Not to be outdone by Stanford, MIT Media Lab has announced its own course to inspire the ""next generation"" of bitcoin talent.  Thanks to a partnership between its Digital Currency Initiative (DCI) and Media Lab Entrepreneurship Program, MIT will join other universities, including Stanford, putting bitcoin into the classroom.  The Massachusetts university has been a hive of extra-curricular bitcoin activity with contests and events including the MIT Bitcoin Project's $500,000 giveaway in the currency – $100 for every student on campus.  Arriving next semester, the course is open to all students at MIT and those cross-registered from institutions around the Boston area.  David Shrier, a lecturer at the Media Lab and one of the brains behind the programme, said the course will study topics ranging from e-commerce to market systems.  He added:  ""Our course will provide students with a broad perspective on what’s going on, where success and failure has struck, and what the future looks like from various angles.""  It will be lead by serial entrepreneur and famed computer scientist Alex 'Sandy' Pentland alongside DCI director Brian Forde – an ex-White House advisor hoping to ""mainstream"" blockchain technology.  MIT Media Lab, which now supports several bitcoin core developers, will also be offering a ""highly technical"" course around coding the blockchain, Shrier said.

42426461,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJsx7h,1440497816,Bitcoin Tweets of the Week: Forking Drama and Black Monday,"With the bitcoin fork debate still raging, it is hardly surprising it has been a hot topic on social media over the past week.    Twitter was awash with comments featuring both sides of the camp – those in favour and those against Bitcoin XT, the software fork that seeks to resolve the digital currency's scalability issue by increasing the size of blocks.  On the other hand, Black Monday – which saw Chinese stock markets plummet to an eight year low and panic spread throughout the rest of the world's stock markets – also resulted in some Twitter chatter, enabling those bullish on bitcoin to share their largely positive outlook on the digital currency.  #BitcoinXT  The mainstream media dubbed the bitcoin fork a ""civil war"" and a ""constitutional crisis"", but some crypto enthusiasts were no less critical.    #BitcoinXT appears to be the biggest attack on Bitcoin in history.        — Greg Slepak (@taoeffect) August 21, 2015    Although slightly less harsh, Oleg Andreev also voiced his disagreement.    One thing I really dislike about XT is that it does not introduce a single controversial thing, but several such things at once.        — Oleg Andreev (@oleganza) August 20, 2015    Globetrotting entrepreneur and activist Roger Ver – popularly known as Bitcoin Jesus – on the other hand, took to Twitter to encourage people to install Bitcoin XT.    If you run a full node, and support bigger blocks so more people around the world can use Bitcoin, install XT today: http://t.co/1lSnWn5fxI — Roger Ver (@rogerkver) August 16, 2015          Meanwhile, bitcoin evangelist Andreas Antonopoulos attempted to weigh down the drama by highlighting the significance of the network's diversity and flexibility.  All the fork drama is really overblown. Diversity is good and bitcoin is resilient. Consensus will converge on the correct answer. — AndreasMAntonopoulos (@aantonop) August 20, 2015  Antonopoulos was not the only one focusing on the positive, however, as others also used the opportunity to praise the digital currency's decentralised nature.    The blocksize is a minor issue; what matters is #Bitcoin's ability to govern itself. Unable to evolve is worse than unable to scale. — Emin Gün Sirer (@el33th4xor) August 16, 2015    If you have Bitcoin, your money is stateless, and with that, comes statelessness.      — Erik Voorhees (@ErikVoorhees) August 24, 2015    #BlackMonday  As most people focused on the world's financial markets, watching as hundreds of billions disappeared from stock markets, others continued to focus on bitcoin and its potential. Bitcoin enthusiasts began to ask questions about the potential effects – whether negative or positive – on their beloved digital currency.

About time the bulls returned to #bitcoin? #blackmonday — Paul Melton (@Shadhammer) August 24, 2015          With his tweet, it seems Melton is referring to the fact some people previously used economic downturns to publicly promote the digital currency.  A clear example of this took place a couple of months ago, when the bitcoin bulls came out in full force following the implementation of capital controls in Greece. Despite pundits at the time claiming the digital currency's price was being driven upwards by events in the Southern European country, the extent to which this is true remains to be seen. This, however, did not deter the enthusiasm of bitcoin aficionados who continued to pump the digital currency.    Is the China bubble ready to pop? A significant global stock market correction is imminent? Get some #Bitcoin. Just in case.
