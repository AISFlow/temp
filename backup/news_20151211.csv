42378475,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iIn5,1449869689,Media Caught Up in Search for Satoshi: Bitcoin in the Headlines,"Bitcoin in the Headlines is a weekly analysis of industry media coverage and its impact.  Speculation about the identity of bitcoin's mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, reached a new high this week after tech publications Wired and Gizmodo published reports which both pointed to the likelihood that an Australian entrepreneur named Craig S. Wright played a big role in the birth of the digital currency.  The potential unmasking caused ripples of excitement across international mainstream media outlets that covered the news of the big reveal and the subsequent police raids and signs of an inquiry by Australian tax authorities.  Bitcoin enthusiasts, perhaps fatigued by previous attempts to decipher Nakamoto's identity including a much-maligned effort by Newsweek that mistakenly pointed to a California resident named Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, reacted to the news with a degree of skepticism.  In the wake of the Gizmodo and Wired reports, some outlets moved quickly to offer their own takes on the evidence, casting further doubt on the initial claims.  The hunt for Nakamoto  Following on from Newsweek's attempt at identifying Nakamoto last year, Wired and Gizmodo led the week's newsflow by identifying Wright as the possible person behind bitcoin.  As Wired's piece begins:  ""Even as his face towered 10 feet above the crowd at the Bitcoin Investor's Conference in Las Vegas, Craig Steven Wright was, to most of the audience of crypto and finance geeks, a nobody.""  Wright, the journalists explained, had Skyped into the meeting and was wearing a discreet outfit, consisting of a black blazer and a casual shirt.  ""His name hadn't made the conference's list of 'featured speakers',"" they added, noting that ""even the panel's moderator, a bitcoin blogger named Michele Seven, seemed concerned the audience wouldn't know why he was there"".  Wright reportedly began to introduce himself when Seven interrupted him, asking who he was, to which the Australian responded that he was ""a bit of everything"".  According to the trio, Seven questioned Wright further on his introduction to bitcoin, noting how he seemed like he may be hiding something:  ""He seemed to suppress a smile. The panel's moderator moved on. And for what must have been the thousandth time in his last seven years of obscurity, Wright did not say the words Wired's study of Wright over the past weeks suggests he may be dying to say out loud. 'I am Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of bitcoin'.""  A possible hoax  The Wired journalists said that the publication had acquired the ""strongest evidence yet"" of Nakamoto's true identity.  All signs, they added, pointed to Craig Steven Wright, ""a man who never even made it onto any Nakamoto hunters' public lists of candidates, yet fits the cryptocurrency creator's profile in nearly every detail"".  Despite the available evidence, however, the reporters asserted that it was impossible to determine with absolute certainty whether Wright is Nakamoto.  ""But two possibilities outweigh all others: Either Wright invented bitcoin, or he's a brilliant hoaxer who very badly wants us to believe he did,"" reported Wired.  Gizmodo said that it had been contacted by someone who allegedly hacked Wright's email, though as in the case of Wired, the original source's true identity is unknown at this time.  Further fanning the flames of controversy: the fact that at least two other journalists, including the New York Times' Nathaniel Popper, had also received the tip about Wright months before.  Doubts over PGP keys  In the hours after the Gizmodo and Wired reports were published, other journalists moved to take a closer look at some of the forensic evidence presented – namely the PGP keys said to connect Wright to the Nakamoto identity.  Motherboard's Sarah Jeong had this to say:  ""A lot of this evidence isn't authenticated, so there's that. A lot of this evidence isn’t authenticated, so there’s that. But there’s one really big problem with the case for Craig S. Wright as Satoshi: at least one of the key pieces of evidence appears to be fake. The “Satoshi” PGP keys associated with the Wired and Gizmodo stories were probably generated after 2009 and uploaded after 2011.""  Jeong explained the plural usage of ""keys"", adding that Wired and Gizmodo examined two different sets of data and that ""neither of them check out"".  Having noticed this discrepancy, Jeong confirmed that Motherboard had reached out to Gizmodo for comment. Gizmodo editor Katie Drummond reportedly said that the keys were ""just one (relatively small) data point among many others, including in-person interviews and on-the-record corroboration"".  Jeong went on to write that the keys are important, not only because they seem outright suspicious, but also because there is evidence to suggest tampering.  At this point, Jeong adds that Wired's Andy Greenberg had said that this had been considered, and served as proof that the Wright/Nakamoto connection may be a hoax, going on to conclude:  ""Listen, PGP is hard. Maybe the ingenious Craig-Satoshi-Nakamoto-Wright, like most ordinary people, can’t stop losing access to his PGP keys and keeps having to upload different keys to the keyserver. But the metadata, Greg Maxwell’s chatlogs, and the online trail just don’t really add up. And as Kashmir Hill pointed out at Fusion, “there are obvious incentives for an entrepreneur active in the blockchain and security space”—like Craig Wright—“to be known as the talented developer behind Bitcoin.”  Unconvinced by the arguments put forward, Jeong adds: ""Whatever’s going on here, it’s pretty fishy.""  Why should we care?  Media outlets scurried to cover the news, some even questioning the link between the relatively unknown Australian businessman and what is known about Satoshi Nakamoto, who played an active development role and regularly posted online in bitcoin's early years.  Others simply questioned why the public should be concerned with the identity of the digital currency's creator. Alex Fitzpatrick over at Time may hold the key as to why the rest of the world should care, writing:  ""Bitcoin is beloved by free-market types because it has no central bank, no Fed, no Janet Yellen controlling the money supply. But if Bitcoin’s alleged creator really is sitting on a half-billion dollar stockpile of the stuff, he will have become the kind of central banker archetype that Bitcoin’s die-hard fans consider their personal boogeyman.""  ""Should Wright cash out and make off with a more widely-accepted currency like dollars, Bitcoin may never recover from the price shock triggered by the sudden glut in supply,"" Fitzpatrick went on to write. ""Thus, the destiny of a supposedly decentralized currency may rest in the hands of one person — exactly the fate it was created to avoid.""

42378492,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iJ4h,1449841856,Bitcoin Price Rockets To One-Year High on Record Volumes,"Correction: Article has been updated to reflect that one-year high is based on BPI closing prices; 36% gain was achieved in last two weeks, not last four days.  The price of bitcoin has hit its highest closing price in the last year, trading at $436 and climbing at press time, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index.  Bitcoin has gained an astonishing $115 or 36% over the last two weeks. It was changing hands for $320 a coin on 25th November. The price briefly touched $500 on some exchanges on 4th November before dropping under $400 in the following days.  The strong rally is accompanied by record-breaking trading volumes on bitcoin exchanges. On 5th December 3.49 million bitcoins were traded across all exchanges tracked by data provider Bitcoinity. This smashed the previous record for daily traded volume established just days prior, on 26th November, of 2.86 million coins traded.  Trading volume has remained robust since its high watermark, with daily trading consistently closing above the 2 million BTC level.  Falling Yuan  Market-watchers offered theories ranging from the falling price of the yuan, to the media hoopla around a supposed unmasking of Satoshi Nakamoto by two prominent technology publications, to an abundance of positive newsflow around the blocksize debate.  Daniel Masters, who runs the Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment fund that is widely known as GABI, said a weaker yuan was driving Chinese investors into bitcoin. The yuan has fallen 4% against the US dollar this year. He told CoinDesk:  ""It's pretty simple in my view ... A domestic Chinese investor is faced with falling yuan, falling commodity prices and falling real estate prices. One of the few alternatives is bitcoin, which is negatively correlated to all of this.""  Indeed, the exchanges with the most volume traded were the ones based in the mainland, with OKCoin and Huobi leading the way. Observers have previously noted that exchange volume figures, which are self reported, should be treated with caution because they can be manipulated.  Masters said China will continue to be a major factor driving the bitcoin price up in the long term as its economy continues to slow and the yuan sheds value.  The Wall Street Journal reported four days ago that the bitcoin rally was being driven by traders arbitraging the cryptocurrency and units of the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), which is publicly traded.  Unlikely Arbitrage  Although the Journal did not describe the arbitrage mechanism, its story claimed that narrowing spreads between the bitcoin price and the GBTC price allowed traders to profit as they would when arbitraging an exchange-traded fund (ETF) and its underlying assets.  ""The increased activity on the OTCQX-traded fund may have triggered a wave of bitcoin buying, contributing to the price spike,"" the Journal wrote.  Market watchers on r/BitcoinMarkets have discounted this theory, pointing out that shares in GBTC traded in the public markets must be held by unit-holders for at least a year, meaning they are disconnected from the current bitcoin price.  ""There is no mentionable arbitrage mechanism, only GBTC shares you can buy/sell are the year-old+ [Bitcoin Investment Trust] ones,"" one punter wrote on r/BitcoinMarkets.  Institutional trader Harry Yeh of Binary Financial said a slew of news coverage around bitcoin in the previous weeks has been a critical price driver.  Positive newsflow  Yeh pointed to the Scaling Bitcoin conference in Hong Kong, which produced the 'segregated witness' scaling solution that doesn't require a hard fork as one example. Additionally, the Satoshi 'unmasking' by Wired and Gizmodo has cast a spotlight on the cryptocurrency, he said.  Yeh said bitcoin may simply be rebounding from a pronounced price dive in 2014, when it was ""very oversold"". Conversely, he said the technical indicators, in his view, showed that bitcoin is now on a trajectory similar to its massive run-up in 2013, which led to it breaking the $1,000 mark.  Yeh said:  ""Looking at all the factors and the technical factors ... bitcoin could rocket past $600.""",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | FORKS,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/12/11/bitcoin-price-rockets-to-one-year-high-on-record-volumes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b591a4461cc0d3bd5350382f334a0219f35a0f51-1500x1133.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42378484,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iIvt,1449808829,ANX CTO: Bitcoin’s Scalability Issue is a ‘Red Herring’,"During a talk at Finnovasia 2015 in Hong Kong this week, ANX CTO Hugh Madden told an audience of gathered FinTech professionals that he believes concerns about the bitcoin blockchain’s ability to scale are a ""red herring"".  The comments notably follow the two-day Scaling Bitcoin conference at which the open, public blockchain’s global development community came together to propose technical issues related to the bitcoin protocol.  Madden, who later appeared on a panel conversation centered on the technology’s growth in Asia, made the case at the event that despite the level of press time issue has received, lofty expectations for the bitcoin blockchain are the root of what he argues is a mischaracterization of its technical efficiencies.  Madden told the audience:  ""It's a complete and utter red herring. Name any form of data transfer that is responsible for every data transfer in the world? There's good applications and there’s bad ones, but scalability is not a showstopper.""  In part, Madden justified his belief by citing the fact that the majority of the experts in the burgeoning field have ""never worked"" in a financial company and are likely to continue to work on the bitcoin blockchain, a trend he believes is unlikely to change.  The CTO, who founded ANX in 2013 after two years working at HSBC, further suggested that the rise of blockchain is likely to mirror that of mobile financial technologies, which have also evolved without the financial industry.  “I look at the next generation and I see it as a tide. You’re not going to stop this tide. We’ve lost the last mile battle. This is how the next generation works,” he said, holding up his mobile smartphone to the audience.  In this light, he contends blockchain startups are more likely to become the next Googles and Facebooks than any bank.  Madden went on to say that he believes efforts like those by distributed ledger consortium R3 are being driven by a fear of missing out, but that such sentiments likely hide the fact that banks will be unable to compete against tech-savvy startups regardless of these efforts.  'Big' comparison  Elsewhere, Madden put forth the argument that the hype surrounding blockchain is comparable to that around big data, a comparison that comes at a time Gartner has indicated 75% of businesses say they will invest in that technology.  Madden supported his statement by referencing the impressive investment levels seen so far in the space over the course of 2015.  ""The hype of blockchain this year is approaching big data,"" he said. ""This year we've seen the biggest-ever investments in blockchain. NYSE is prototyping blockchain settlement. I got to pitch to MasterCard.""  Building off his previous remarks, Madden also suggested that he believes professionals in the traditional investment industry are increasingly seeking to take advantage of employment opportunities in the blockchain sector because of this momentum.  He concluded:  ""I believe there is a bigger brain drain going on in blockchain than there was with big data.""

42378485,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iIyP,1449800352,Deutsche Bank Research: Bitcoin Isn’t Eliminating Intermediaries,"A new Deutsche Bank Research report suggests the bitcoin network is in some ways failing to live up to its original vision.  Released on 9th December, the Deutsche Bank paper notes that the bitcoin ecosystem now includes ""a number of financial intermediaries"" despite the fact that it was created to be a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) cash system without such entities.  Intermediaries, according to the report, include bitcoin exchanges and hosted wallets, which author Heike Mai indicated have highly centralized liquidity within the alternative financial system.  Mai writes:  ""The original idea of bitcoin – to create a peer-to-peer scheme that is independent of intermediaries and central agents – is to some degree being overhauled by real life. The bitcoin ecosystem now includes a number of financial intermediaries, like wallet providers and exchanges, and these show a trend towards concentration.""  Overall, the report seeks to examine the role of cryptocurrencies and distributed ledgers in the broader shift toward real-time payments, with Mai stating that the emerging technology offers a ""novel"" design proposal for such a system.  ""Although still in its infancy, blockchain technology might revolutionise the financial industry which is characterised by tiered, centralised networks in many markets,"" the report reads.  Elsewhere, the report analyzes how different closed- and open-loop payment systems can achieve real-time global payments, offering an outlook for how it believes each can achieve this larger goal.  The findings suggest that Deutsche Bank, which joined the R3 distributed ledger consortium this September, is optimistic about the potential of decentralized cryptographic technologies, even if their future outlook isn't certain:  ""Given the early stage of development, it is still unclear if blockchain technology is suited to underpinning significant instant retail payment traffic in the future.""  Instant processing  Notably, cryptographic ledger systems, the paper states, have to some extent already succeeded in bringing real-time payments to a relatively small market.  The report notes that while bitcoin transactions can take 10 minutes to confirm, consensus systems such as the permissioned Ripple protocol offer transfers ""within seconds"". Still, the biggest open question toward the use of these systems, the author reasons, is that the technology has only been tested on a small scale to date.  Should the scale of these networks be increased, Mai also speculates that new pressures may reshape how public blockchains like bitcoin operate.  ""Sceptics expect that distributed (ie decentralised) payment systems will not be able to compete with centralised transfer systems on cost, unless they concentrate processing in fewer miners,"" he writes.  In addition, Mai says that blockchain systems still face many unanswered legal questions, such as how laws can be enforced in such networks without centralizing agents.
