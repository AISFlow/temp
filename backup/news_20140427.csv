42377185,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zftv,1398600676,"Scams, Hacks and Poor Management: Life After Silk Road","When US authorities busted up the Silk Road and arrested alleged kingpin Ross Ulbricht last fall, it didn’t mean the end of online drugs-for-bitcoin markets. Alternative trading posts popped up immediately, and existing ones expanded to accommodate displaced buyers and sellers.      However the sites have been rocked by thefts, more arrests and other troubles, leading some customers and even investigators to wax nostalgic about the ""original"" Dread Pirate Roberts, as Silk Road's founder called himself.      One customer, who goes by the nickname 'hugs', wrote in a message to CoinDesk:      ""[Chaos] is the word that I would choose to describe the landscape as it has morphed and changed after SilkRoad's seizure. Many sites have come and gone [...] many of them developing quite a following before being shut down or hacked. Buyers and vendors alike have been on a constant search for a stable market, one that will be around for longer than a couple of months.""              One law enforcement source said the new markets are barely worth investigating at this point. He raised February's heist of thousands of bitcoins from Silk Road 2.0 as an example of bad management:      “When the original Dread was running it, that never happened. It's not being run as well.”              The law enforcement source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he was involved in the original Silk Road investigation, but now is just keeping an eye on Silk Road 2.0 in the background.      In fact, he’s not sure any law enforcement agencies are making Silk Road 2.0 or other online drug markets a priority.      Silk Road 2.0's first admin styled himself as Dread Pirate Roberts, just as Ulbricht is alleged to have done, but he disappeared from the scene after three of the site's alleged moderators were arrested in December, and the site's new administrator calls himself 'Defcon'.    Users don't know who to trust    Other sites to position themselves as Silk Road alternatives include the Sheep Marketplace, Black Market Reloaded, Utopia, Agora, Pandora, BlueSky and many others; some of these sites have shut down, others are still accessible on the deep web via the Tor browser.      Of the current crop, 'hugs' named Agora as the most stable, saying its administrators appear to be working diligently to gain user trust. But so far, no would-be mastermind seems to be able to fill the shoes of the original Dread Pirate Roberts.      For one thing, many have failed to keep users’ bitcoins safe. In addition to the Silk Road 2.0 theft, another deep web trading post, Sheep Marketplace, reported a $6m heist and shut down in late 2013. In March, the market known as Pandora reported a theft of $250,000 in bitcoin, promised repayment, and stayed open.      Because of the anonymous nature of these markets, it’s difficult for users to know if the sites were really hacked, or if the administrators just absconded with their bitcoins. The law enforcement source added:      “Either the administrators don't have the level of expertise or the dedication to the web site that [the original DPR] did, or it could be that they're running a scam.”              Users have tried following bitcoin movements through the block chain for clues, but that is probably a futile pursuit according to University of California-San Diego cryptographer Sarah Meiklejohn. She wrote in an email:      ""It would be difficult to verify just from block chain analysis if a theft were carried out by external thieves or by the owners of the service, since the movement of the bitcoins would presumably be the same either way. If you saw the bitcoins deposited into an exchange, and then asked that exchange who the real-world owner of that account was, you might learn something, but (1) that's not something that most users can do, and (2) operators of dark marketplaces are almost certainly not using their real names anyway. So basically, that doesn't seem possible.""              This leads users to be a bit jumpy. When a market has a temporary outage, threads pop up on reddit speculating whether the site's organizers have taken the money and run.      When Sheep Marketplace claimed it was robbed, users had already been speculating for days that a scam was in the works, since they had been unable to withdraw bitcoins from their accounts.    The aftermath of hacks    Silk Road 2.0 administrators appear to be making good on promises to reimburse users for losses following the alleged transaction malleability attack that hit the site in February.      Defcon posted on the site's forums in early April that half the victims had been fully repaid, and that 100% had received at least a partial payment. He set 9th June as a rough target for full repayment.      A number of Silk Road 2.0 users commented in the forum that they had indeed received payment, however, a few said they had received nothing as of early April. In turn, many users have not yet logged in to claim their reimbursement, according to the site's administrator.      Other markets have handled things far differently. Sheep Marketplace's admins vanished after claiming theft. And the admin of Project Black Flag openly admitted pocketing users' bitcoins when he shut down the market last fall.      “[It] makes us realize once again how cool and proper Ross Ulbricht (allegedly) was. He could have fleeced people but instead he empowered people. Sad loss,” reddit user 'bitchrome' commented in a discussion about the Sheep Marketplace shutdown.      Another reddit user, 'JAMDIAM', sounded fed up with post-Silk Road markets:      “I don't eff with these markets anymore for two reasons: 1) They're clearly crawling with Feds. 2) The management of these sites will never match the original DPR (aka Ross Ulbricht).""              Ross Ulbricht denies the FBI allegations and is currently in a New York detention centre awaiting trial.    Improving security    To prevent future thefts, Defcon removed Silk Road 2.0's centralized escrow system, writing on the market's forum that ""Centralization makes a market a huge target for attackers, and a huge target for dishonest administrators.""      Instead, Defcon said the market will move to a multi-signature escrow system, in which a single person cannot move funds without agreement from one or more other signers. BlackBank, Cannabis Road, Cloud-Nine, DarkBay, Hydra, The Marketplace and Tor Bazaar are all listed as multisig markets on the darknetmarkets subreddit.      Dark market shopper 'hugs' clarified:      ""I think that within the next year we will see [multisignature escrow] become the standard for markets across the board. Vendors are tired of having their hard-earned money stolen or hacked, as are users. There are enough stressors in this business without the constant worry of dishonest or incompetent market admins to add to the list.""              'Hugs' added: ""My hope is that multi-signature escrow will work to alleviate the fear of market scams. Although traditional escrow is currently much less complicated and more convenient for the average buyer, I think we'll soon begin to see multi-sig simplified and implemented in a way that even the most technologically deficient buyers [such as myself] can still take advantage of its benefits.""      Of course, if the illegal marketplaces succeed in gaining customer trust – and, as a result, higher sales – they will also become a much larger target for law enforcement.      “I don't know how much interest law enforcement has in Silk Road 2.0 right now. When they get up and start running hard, maybe they'll start taking a harder look at it,” said the Silk Road investigator.

42377179,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zfjr,1398597059,Is Bitcoin Really the Next Internet?,"Everyone who encounters bitcoin for the first time must grapple with how it works, and what it means.  The former is relatively easy enough to learn, the latter however is something that everyone seems to have a different opinion on. 'Is bitcoin the next Internet?' seems to be the question behind news articles and passionate debates alike.    Entrepreneur and bitcoin advocate Marc Andreessen has most visibly made comparisons between the two, while CNBC reported that many more venture capitalists thought bitcoin could be 'as big as the Internet'.      Despite obvious buzz appeal, it’s a serious question with profound implications. How alike are bitcoin and the Internet, and what conclusions can we draw from the comparison?    A natural metaphor  Within the world of monetary theory and finance, bitcoin is unprecedented. It is such a radical concept that many in the field are sceptical that the kind of decentralization bitcoin represents is even compatible with the modern economy.    The Internet thus provides an obvious reference point for a technology that seems utterly similar in its decentralization, open-source code, state of development, and most importantly its potential to disrupt on a global scale.      Indeed, if nothing else, the comparison can help effectively communicate the magnitude of bitcoin's technological achievement.      Chris Ellis, the co-founder of feathercoin, captures this sentiment eloquently:      “The first thing that humanity has built that humanity doesn’t understand, the largest experiment in anarchy that we have ever had.”              That’s actually a quote from Eric Schmidt, talking about the Internet or the 'network of networks'. Every network it touches it liberates: already we’ve seen publishing, education, retail, and most famously music and film changed in ways we could not have imagined. Does bitcoin represent a similar moment for banking and finance?      Given the fact that bitcoin cannot be centrally regulated, 'an experiment in anarchy' seems like an apt description. However for any bitcoin/Internet comparison to be truly useful and tell us where the technology can go from here, we need to compare characteristics in greater detail.    Core difference  Although bitcoin and the Internet are both decentralized, they serve rather distinct purposes.  The Internet evolved as the general purpose infrastructure for a limitless amount of applications and traffic, such as email. Bitcoin on the other hand has a very specific core purpose, a 'peer-to-peer electronic cash system' as described in the title of Satoshi's original whitepaper.    Ultimately, most services built on top of bitcoin are meant to help it achieve its primary goal as a medium of exchange in one way or another. It exceeds this function by leaps and bounds – accomplishing what the current financial infrastructure is incapable of.      However, as a general platform for new applications to run on bitcoin currently has severe limitations. Mastercoin, Counterparty, and others have attempted to build additional functionality on top of the bitcoin protocol with limited success.      While the bitcoin block chain does contain properties that allow it to be used for third-party purposes, the resources are limited and have led to conflict in the past.      Bitcoin simply isn’t designed to function as the flexible infrastructure for a wide range of applications like the Internet is.    Block chain potential  However, the potential exists to use the fundamental technology underlying bitcoin, the decentralised block chain, to build numerous decentralized applications.  Decentralized applications have been getting much media attention as of late as the true revolution behind bitcoin, and where we’ll see the most groundbreaking innovation.  It opens the doors to decentralized email, domain names, smart contracts, and even Decentralized Autonomous Corporations. As David Jonston, Executive Director of BitAngels, put it:  “[Decentralized applications or DAs] have the potential to become self-sustaining because they empower their stakeholders to invest in the development of the DA. Because of that, it is conceivable that DAs for payments, social networking, and cloud computing may one day surpass the valuation of multinational corporations like Western Union, Visa, Facebook, Google, and Amazon that are are currently active in the space.”  Even Goldman Sachs remarked that the underlying technology behind bitcoin holds promise. Systems designed with the bitcoin blueprint can be extremely specific in nature, or instead provide a backbone that can support as many programs and applications as human creativity can generate – much like the Internet and web. Ethereum is currently being built on that very premise.    Bitcoin itself however remains first and foremost a means of exchanging value. While its block chain technology holds the potential to create a new platform of permissionless innovation, this platform has, until recently, seemed destined to be divorced from the main bitcoin chain and functionality.    Enter side chains  In the context of the Internet comparison debate, new side chain proposals have great significance.  If implemented into the bitcoin core code by the open-source community, it would enable anyone to create a side chain that can interact with the bitcoin block chain via two-way pegging. Coins can be moved from one chain to the other, allowing decentralized systems to be built that are interoperable with bitcoin.    [post-quote]      This means that new decentralized applications won’t require their own native unit of exchange and thus can avoid a new 'race for scarcity', as well as the extreme volatility that comes with a new, small market cap currency.      Instead, such systems can utilize the rapidly maturing and more widely-accepted bitcoin as their native means of exchange and operation. In turn, the utility of such systems will directly add to the value and staying power of the bitcoin network.      The implications of this are huge, as side chains will allow the general purpose infrastructure needed to allow the permissionless innovation the Internet and web are famous for. All tied in the end, to bitcoin.      Side chains could be the last piece of the puzzle that links together the bitcoin currency, to the limitless possibilities its block chain technology holds.    Brave new world  This would make bitcoin not 'merely' a new e-cash system that far outperforms the capabilities of modern financial infrastructure. It would make bitcoin the de-facto currency in a new decentralized online economy of unbound utility and possibility.  An economy of decentralized applications that can’t be shut down, regulated, or censored by governments or even traditional corporations. All exchanging a similarly decentralized transnational digital currency.  Thanks to side chains, bitcoin could become a frictionless global payment system, and a platform for decentralized innovation all in one.  'Bitcoin is the next Internet' has been a useful slogan to gain mainstream attention, and underscore bitcoin's potential impact on the world. However when we take a more systematic view of bitcoin's growing evolution as a whole, a more appropriate comparison becomes readily apparent.  Rather than the next Internet, bitcoin can become the next killer app for the Internet, much like the web before it. A massive network of decentralized applications run by instant microtransactions rather than the exploitation of users' personal information and more.  A new web with new rules, and new possibilities.
