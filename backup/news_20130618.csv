The company has not been able to handle transactions since April, when authorities closed its bank accounts.  In its most recent update, the exchange's law firm, Röhl, Dehm & Partner, said it expected to begin notifying customers by email last week about payments that have been due to them from Bitcoin-24's German Commerzbank AG.  ""In this e-mail, we shall ask for confirmation of the payment amount and shall request that various details be provided, such as name, address, date and place of birth and nationality,"" attorney Christian M. Röhl announced in a June 7 release. ""We apologise for this further delay.""  A news alert published at the top of the law firm's press page added a warning to all Bitcoin-24 customers with gmail addresses: ""We have recently become aware several times that our e-mails from Google GMail are moved to the spam (folder). Please check your spam folder and mark our email as 'not spam'. Thank you very much.""  In a reddit thread started on Monday, user UnderpaidBIGtime reported the first withdrawals of euros from Bitcoin-24's accounts.  ""So we got first money showing up today,"" UnderpaidBIGtime wrote. ""Lets (sic) hope all balances will be restored soon!""  Bitcoin-24, which had been the largest bitcoin exchange in Europe, went offline in April after authorities closed its German and Polish bank accounts. Exchange owner Simon Hausdorf blamed the shutdown on fraudulent transactions made by criminals who used phishing attacks to hack his customers' accounts.  In late May, Bitcoin-24's law firm announced that the seizure of the exchange's German bank accounts had been lifted by the public prosecutor's office in Berlin.  “This means that the suspicions concerning our client in relation to the alleged fraud and money laundering could not be substantiated,” Röhl-Dehm & Partner stated at the time, adding that the exchange was preparing to begin making its first payments due to customers with funds in the German bank.  As of June 7, there has been no further word on the status of Bitcoin-24's Polish bank account.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Shirley Siluk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/18/europes-bitcoin-24-exchange-shows-new-signs-of-life,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376541,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AsNR,1371558625,What are Namecoins and .bit domains?,"One digital currency that you might not have heard of is Namecoin. It is based on exactly the same code as Bitcoin. In fact, the two currencies are almost identical. However, in the same way that Bitcoin is a decentralised currency that cannot be shut down; Namecoin is the basis for a decentralised domain name system (DNS), i.e. web URLs, which could put a stop to Internet censorship.  What is the DNS system?  While we're all used to typing text addresses into our browser and email programs, such as coindesk.com, the Internet doesn't run on text. The Internet actually works on numerical addresses called IP addresses, just in the same way we dial telephone numbers. The problem is that numbers are not easy to remember. Therefore, an Internet wide address book, called the Domain Name System (DNS), was created to make navigation much easier.  Every time you type an address into your browser, your computer or mobile device is actually querying a DNS server. It has to ask for the IP address of the destination server before it can retrieve any data for you. For example, typing ""google.com"" into your browser will trigger your computer to check its DNS server for Google's IP address. The DNS server will return a number like 173.194.70.113.  The very last part of a domain, e.g. .com, is called a top-level domain (TLD). TLDs are controlled by central authorities. For example, the .com TLD is controlled by ICANN in the United States. These central authorities allow third party companies, known as registrars, to deal with accepting domain name orders and customer service.  Whenever anyone has a complaint with a website, the central authority for its TLD has the ultimate say on what happens to it. In most real world cases, lawyers, copyright holders, etc., will simply contact the domain's registrar. However, the potential for commands from a central authority should be of concern to groups who will suffer due to censorship.  How does decentralisation help?  A decentralised DNS system means that TLDs can exist which are not owned by anyone, and the DNS lookup tables are shared on a peer-to-peer system. As long as there are volunteers running the customised DNS server software for the rest of us, then we can always access any alternative domains. Short of seizing the physical servers, authorities cannot impose rules to affect the operation of a peer-to-peer top level domain.  What does this have to do with crypto-currency?  The model of Bitcoin involves a peer-to-peer system where participants are continuously validating a series of transactions without any central control. That model was directly applied to the domain name system by modifying the bitcoin protocol and the result was called Namecoin (NMC). In particular, a new genesis block was created, so that a whole new block chain would be created. This ensures that Namecoin and Bitcoin do not interact or interfere with each other. Secondly, the developers of Namecoin created several transaction types to reflect the needs of a new domain name system. Because of the shared heritage, there will only ever by 21 million Namecoins created, and 50 coins are generated for each solved block of crypto problems.  How to use Namecoins to register .bit domains  .bit  is the first and only TLD of the so-called Domain 2.0 namespace. The actions necessary to register a new domain or to update an existing one are built into the Namecoin protocol by means of the new transaction types mentioned above.  There are three types of Namecoin transaction (source):  name_new – Registration cost 0.01 NMC. This constitutes a fixed cost pre-order of a domain.  name_firstupdate – Registration cost 0 NMC. Registers a domain making it publically visible, subject to variable costs (price calculator).  name_update – Registration cost 0 NMC. This is used for updating, renewing or transferring a domain.  All NMC transactions are subject to a 0.005NMC fee.  Even though the Namecoin system effectively makes you into your own domain registrar, there are some registration services out there, who offer to handle the registration for you and take payment in BTC. Additionally, they offer services such as an (easier) interface to modify domain details and to automatically renew.  http://register.dot-bit.org/  Namecoin.com  Dotbit.me  How to view .bit websites  Namecoin.com claims to have registered at least 450 domains. According to the Bitcoin Contact website, there is a grand total of 77,000 registered .bit domains (full list here). That's all well and good, but because they are not part of the standard domain name system, you can't just type, e.g., wikileaks.bit into your browser and expect to see a website.  Fortunately, there are .bit web proxy servers that will correctly handle your DNS requests in a browser. To make the process even easier, there are extensions, via Namecoin.com, for Firefox and Chrome.  How can Namecoin and Bitcoin complement each other?  While the two digital currencies do not interact, they do rely on exactly the same set of mathematical problems. Therefore, the same hardware used to mine bitcoins can be used to mine Namecoins. Furthermore, there is process called merged mining, in which a mining machine is configured to query both block chains whenever it comes up with a possible solution to the cryptographic problems. The Dot-bit wiki describes this as entering two lotteries with the same ticket to increase the odds of winning.  How does this affect you?  The chances are that 99% of the people reading this do not need to create a .bit website or service. However, information is power as the saying goes, and so it is important that you have the capability to access websites and email addresses on the .bit namespace.  Yes, this technology can be abused just like anything else, and so it's even more imperative that we all have the capability to view the .bit namespace so that we're aware of the good and the bad.  More important than anything else, however, is that the ability to view .bit websites means attempts to silence those with a legitimate message will have less of a chance of succeeding.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/18/what-are-namecoins-and-bit-domains,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/366cd26d52418a44e84557148cc79de9cf475578-1100x602.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376540,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AsKv,1371544568,Analyst predicts final chapter for Amazon Coins,"A new report has predicted the demise of Amazon Coins, arguing that the initiative goes against industry trends and could incur a user backlash.  ‘Alternative Currencies: Is There Staying Power?’  is a report from Mercator Advisory Group, which specializes in reports to the payment industry. It charts recent developments in four areas: cryptocurrencies, community currencies started regionally, in-game currencies, and loyalty points tied to payment cards.  Jeffrey Green, director of the emerging technologies advisory service at Mercator, and author of the report, argues that Amazon bucked the trend by launching its Coins initiative, in which customers could exchange fiat currency for virtual coins ‘minted’ by the online book giant.  “It's interesting that Amazon is going the altcurrency route when the others like Microsoft and Facebook are phasing out their alternative currencies,” Green said. “They're too complex for the purpose they're addressing.”  Facebook decided to kill off its Credits virtual currency, announcing this month that it would replace it with a local payments API that allows game developers to set exchange rates for their in-game currencies by regional market. This was a response to app developers developing their own currencies for use in games and other apps running on the social networking platform. Facebook Credits will be retired on September 12 this year.  Microsoft also announced this month that it would kill off the Microsoft Points currency that it has used as the financial basis for its Xbox Live gaming platform. Currently, 80 Microsoft Points are worth 1 USD. The company will be returning to fiat currency as the basis for selling games and movies via its online service.  Green predicted that Amazon’s Coins initiative would turn away some customers by making the process of buying products too complex, adding in another step where it was not needed.  Amazon began issuing the coins in May, pegging them at 100 to the USD, which makes it easier to calculate their value than it is for Microsoft Points. To spur the uptake of the coins, it provided $5 in Amazon Coins to all of its US-based Kindle Fire users (the coins are only available to US customers).  “They’re too complex for the purpose they’re addressing,” Green said. “I have the feeling that over time, Amazon may need to follow suit with what Facebook and Microsoft are doing with their own coins.”  “I can see why they want to do it; they have more control and can maybe save some money,” he added.  ArsTechnica has also criticized Amazon, along with the providers of other proprietary currencies, for creating currencies that are difficult to ‘zero out’. This means that customers will often end up with small balances of coins in their accounts that must be topped up by purchasing more coins, creating a perpetual cycle of spending and locking people into the currency. To be fair, though, Amazon’s exchange rate of 1 coin = 1 cent makes them easier to map to the US dollar than Microsoft Points.  Amazon’s coins are part of its in-app purchase flow, and can be used to buy other content in the digital app store. The company has also built a healthy business from electronic publishing, in which authors can publish their own books and set pricing online. Those authors can receive up to 70% of the profits from the sale of electronic books on the Kindle, whether the purchaser pays in Amazon Coins or fiat currency. The company recently furthered its self-publishing business by offering a Fan Fiction service, enabling fans to publish their own stories based on popular works. The service, Kindle Worlds, would compensate the fan authors for their work.  The company also filed an application with the US patent office in April that would enable digital currency to support anonymous mobile payments.  Apple is expected to follow Amazon's move to launch its own currency after it was found to have filed a patent for 'iMoney'.",NEGATIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/18/analyst-predicts-final-chapter-for-amazon-coins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6d06c289a3419f30606d2a95f2db7a04ada84987-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376549,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AsTj,1371538859,Draper 'entrepreneur heroes' University welcomes tuition in bitcoins,"Draper University  is not your average college. In fact, if your university years are over, it’s probably not like any institute of higher education that you have ever heard of.  Tim Draper, a well-known venture capitalist and managing director of the VC firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson, founded the school. (Check out Draper’s bio on the firm’s website, and you’ll find – in addition to the usual curriculum vitae details – a picture of Draper riding some sort of dual horned animal statue.)  Officially known as Draper University of Heroes, the school’s goal is to educate the world’s next generation of entrepreneurs. In determining admissions criteria for incoming students, the university doesn’t look at transcripts or SAT scores. It does look at an application form, and it is clearly trying to determine what your appetite for risk-taking as an entrepreneur really is as a condition of admission.  Is it any wonder then, that Draper, based in Silicon Valley, is the first school to accept fees for tuition in bitcoins? Last week, the school announced it would be the first educational institution accepting them. Naturally, CoinDesk wanted to learn more, so we contacted the school.  “So far, we have one student in our summer class paying his tuition in bitcoin,” says Carol Lo, a representative for Draper. “I hope that more follow in the future.”  Lo added, “We are also opening a co-working space/incubator across the street from Draper University, and we will accept bitcoin for payment there too.”  Boost VC  , a VC firm started by Tim Draper’s son, Adam, has committed to funding a number of Bitcoin-related startups, so opening an incubator nearby Draper that accepts BTC makes sense.  The higher education atmosphere in the United States is ripe for transition. With soaring tuition costs leaving many graduates with large amounts of student loan debt and weak job skills, some – Draper among them – are challenging the idea of the traditional four-year university.  Draper certainly has long-term hopes for digital currencies. When asked what the school plans to do with its bitcoin holdings, Lo said it’s saving, not spending, them: “We are holding the bitcoins because we expect it to appreciate.”  What do you think about Draper’s decision to accept bitcoins for tuition? Do you think that college students should be exposed to math-based currencies in their studies?",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/18/draper-entrepreneur-heroes-university-welcomes-tuition-in-bitcoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ed7f9d86ac835ba68cc60669715ef0a7b121d201-500x278.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
