42396135,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0okQ,1643844526,First Mover Asia: Crypto Prices Plunge Late After Weak Meta Earnings,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Bitcoin ended its two-day winning streak with heavier selling pressure during late U.S. trading hours.  Technician's take: BTC's pullback could continue into the Asia trading day; initial support at $35K.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $37,031 -4.5%  Ether (ETH): $2,690 -3.8%  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Internet Computer ICP +8.4% Computing Ethereum Classic ETC +2.1% Smart Contract Platform Algorand ALGO +0.2% Smart Contract Platform  Top Losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Solana SOL −6.2% Smart Contract Platform Cosmos ATOM −6.0% Smart Contract Platform Stellar XLM −4.3% Smart Contract Platform  Markets  S&P 500: 4,589 +0.9%  DJIA: 35,629 +0.6%  Nasdaq: 14,417 +0.5%  Gold: $1,807 +0.3%  Market moves  Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader crypto market faced heavier selling pressure in late U.S. trading hours on Wednesday, ending the oldest cryptocurrency’s two-day winning streak.  The late afternoon price drop in crypto came after Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) delivered disappointing Q4 earnings with weak guidance for the current quarter. Meta shares dropped by more than 18% in extended trading on Wednesday.  At the time of publication, the largest cryptocurrency by market value is changing hands at $37,031, down 4.5% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data. Ether, the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading at $2,690, off 3.8% for the same period.  According to data compiled by CoinDesk, bitcoin’s trading volume across major centralized exchanges on Wednesday continued to drop.  In broader cryptocurrency markets, most alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoin) were also in the red on Wednesday. At the time of publication, some of the day's biggest losers were tokens associated with the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, including loopring (LRC), curve (CRV) and solana (SOL), based on data from Messari.  Ether suffered more losses than bitcoin during the late trading after a “potential exploit” of more than 120,000 ether (worth more than $326 million in total) was discovered on cross-chain bridge Wormhole. The popular bridge for connecting Solana and a few other major networks is attempting to negotiate on-chain with the hacker, as CoinDesk reported.  The event is ongoing, with Wormhole tweeting its network is ""down for maintenance"" as the team looks into the issue.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Slides Below $38K; Support Above $35K  Bitcoin (BTC) failed to sustain a bounce above $38,000, although short-term buyers could remain active above the $35,000 support level. Momentum was starting to fade on intraday charts, which means the pullback could continue into the Asia trading day. At the time of publication, bitcoin was trading at about $37,000.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart approached overbought territory on Tuesday, which preceded the current pullback in price. Additionally, the 100-period moving average on the four-hour chart, currently at $38,220, continues to cap brief price gains.  Bitcoin remains in an intermediate-term downtrend since November and has consolidated between $35,000 and $38,000 over the past week. Buyers will need to make a decisive move above $40,000 in order to reverse the downtrend.

None of the three candidates – Sarah Bloom Raskin, Lisa Cook or Philipp Jefferson – has expressed strong opinions about cryptocurrencies, based on a search of web articles.  Plus, the Fed's leadership isn't changing, and the additions to the U.S. central bank's governing panel may not have much sway in determining the course of crypto regulations, said Robert Baldwin, director of policy at the Association for Digital Asset Markets.  “Fed Chair (Jerome) Powell and Governor (Lael) Brainard have been very involved in digital assets to date and have articulated that stablecoins and CBDCs can coexist. If leadership at the Fed had shifted, there would have been a period of learning, delaying current workstreams, and potentially leading to a shift in views towards digital assets,” Baldwin said.  The board, which is the main governing body of the Federal Reserve, consists of seven members who serve a term of four years.  Crypto industry observers will be watching the hearing, because cryptocurrency markets tend to move in response to Federal Reserve monetary policy decisions and regulatory pronouncements.  Biden has nominated Raskin – who was a Fed governor and deputy secretary in the Treasury Department in the Obama administration – to be vice chairwoman of supervision. She would play a leading role in sketching out a regulatory framework for crypto and would work closely with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  The nominees are:  Sarah Bloom Raskin  A Duke University law professor, Raskin is known for her progressive views, which could result in a stricter stance on crypto regulation. Raskin has also previously advocated for regulators to address issues related to climate change more proactively, which could give crypto traders an idea about her view on climate-unfriendly Bitcoin.  Dr. Lisa Cook  Cook served on the White House Council of Economic Advisers under former President Barack Obama, where she focused on economic growth. She is also keen on economic inequality, in particular the effect of racial inequality on the economy. She could play an important role in pointing the central bank toward more financial inclusion, one of the main reasons why crypto emerged in the first place.  Dr. Philip Jefferson  A former research economist at the Fed, Jefferson has focused on the labor market and on poverty issues. He is known for his opinion on how changes in interest rates can have a big impact on low-skilled workers. With the Fed focused on inflation now, Jefferson's own focus will likely be questioned by senators and will be an issue for crypto traders to watch.",NEUTRAL,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/02/federal-reserve-board-nominees-bring-blank-slate-on-crypto-views,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c2ce02b69e39b324d0c3ef618e31097e6dd4d1b4-4000x2667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396118,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0oYc,1643840152,UK Tax Regulator Updates Guidance on Staking and DeFi Lending,"Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the U.K.’s tax agency, has updated its guidance on the taxation of returns from decentralized finance (DeFi) lending and staking in proof-of-stake networks.  According to the new guidance, published Wednesday, how a return from lending or staking is taxed depends on whether it is considered capital or revenue. But deciding if a return is capital or revenue is complicated, as the HMRC itself admits.  “The lending/staking of tokens through decentralized finance (DeFi) is a constantly evolving area, so it is not possible to set out all the circumstances in which a lender/liquidity provider earns a return from their activities and the nature of that return. Instead, some guiding principles are set out,” the update said.  The HMRC first published guidance on how returns from staking are taxed in March 2021. According to last year’s guidance, the taxation of staking activity depended on whether the activity amounted to a “taxable trade,” the wording almost identical to the rules laid out for taxing crypto mining.  In a statement published across multiple social media platforms, the digital assets trade association CryptoUK said the new guidance significantly alters the classification and treatment of DeFi lending and staking for tax purposes in the U.K.  According to the new guidance, the return may be treated as revenue or capital based on a number of factors that include whether the amount of the return was known at the time the agreement was made; whether the return is paid periodically or upon repayment of the principal; and whether the period of the lending is short term or long term.  Another factor is how the return is realized: If it is realized through the disposal of a capital asset, it would indicate a capital receipt.  CryptoUK interprets this to mean that when a token is lent or staked into a platform or protocol, it may be classified as a disposal by the HMRC for tax purposes “at the moment the token leaves the user's wallet.”  “This means that the transaction will be subject to Capital Gains Tax reporting at that moment, even though control still lies with [users], and they expect that the asset is still theirs and will be returned at a point in the future,” the CryptoUK statement said.  The new guidance lays out some examples of how users could decide the nature of their return from lending or staking. For instance, if the return amount, say 5% per annum, was already agreed to, it would most likely be a revenue receipt. If the proceeds are “unknown and speculative,” it’s probably a capital receipt.  According to Ian Taylor, executive director of CryptoUK, the new rules add “undue reporting requirements for the consumer, and creates tax compliance confusion.”  The HMRC update states there may be additional factors that determine the nature of the return, which “highlights the need to obtain all the facts of a transaction before reaching a conclusion as to the nature of the return.”  If crypto investors have any difficulty determining the nature of the return, the HMRC asks them to refer the case for advice following general guidance.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/02/uk-tax-regulator-updates-guidance-on-staking-and-defi-lending,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b86fcfedc6fdd5ac1feffab574af51ff61d4a20e-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

There has been a shift in market sentiment as Bitcoin attempts to bounce from a low near $33,000. A large portion of traders seem to have positioned themselves on the short side. On crypto exchange Binance, according to Jarvis Labs, funding rates for derivatives turned negative. However, they yet need to reach similar levels as in other downtrends. As the chart shows, funding rates on this platform are barely on negative territory while in June 2021, when Bitcoin hit a yearly low of $28,800, the metric stood higher.

Bitcoin investors David Ellis has been tracking large BTC holders and their movements for some months. Ellis has found potential for more danger as most of these investors outload their funds with recent BTC price action. Although there has been some demand for Bitcoin from &apos;Blue Whales&apos;, the overall demand and address distribution seem to be hinting at low interest on the cryptocurrency.

42396149,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0oSi,1643838351,Meta Reports Loss of $10.2B on Augmented/Virtual Reality Operations in 2021,"Meta Platforms lost $10.2 billion in 2021 on its newly created Facebook Reality Labs (FRL) division, which comprises its augmented and virtual reality operations, according to its fourth-quarter earnings report.  Meta announced in the third quarter it would be breaking out results for the division for the first time to show the performance and investments in a group that it considers key to the next generation of online social experiences. The company even changed its name from Facebook to Meta Platforms in October to emphasize the importance of the metaverse to its future.  FRL generated $2.3 billion in revenue in 2021, a small fraction of the almost $116 billion generated from Meta’s family of apps, which include Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. In Q4, FRL reported a loss of $3.3 billion on revenue of $877 million. That was up from a loss of $2.6 billion on revenue of $558 million in the third quarter.  Meta previously estimated FRL would reduce its overall operating profit by about $10 billion in 2021, and said it was committed to spending even more on the division for the next several years.  Overall, Meta reported adjusted Q4 earnings per share of $3.67, falling short of the consensus analyst estimate of $3.85, according to FactSet, while revenue of $33.7 billion was just ahead of the consensus estimate of $33.4 billion. Meta's guidance for first-quarter 2022 revenue also fell short, coming in at between $27 billion to $29 billion, compared with analysts' expectations of $30.2 billion.  Shares of Meta tumbled more than 20% in after-hours trading Wednesday following release of the results.  The earnings follow Meta’s Jan. 31 announcement that it has axed its Diem stablecoin project, selling the project's assets and operations to Silvergate for $182 million in total.  On the earnings call with analysts, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company's metaverse developments include releasing a high-end virtual reality headset by the end of the year. Zuckerberg said Meta is also continuing to work on ""Nazare,"" the company's first fully augmented reality glasses.  The company also said on the call it expects FRL's operating loss to ""increase meaningfully"" in 2022.  This is a developing story and will be updated.

In a tweet, the project’s official Twitter handle confirmed that the bridge is currently down while the team investigates a potential exploit, and the official website simply reads, “Portal is Temporarily Unavailable.”  On-chain analysts called attention to an 80,000 ether (ETH) transaction from Wormhole to an address currently in possession of over $250 million worth of ETH. According to another developer, the attacker also kept 40,000 ETH on Solana, where they have been selling for other assets.  In a tweet, prominent pseudonymous Paradigm security researcher “samczsun” noted that the Wormhole team has reached out to the exploiter’s address on the Ethereum network, offering a $10 million bounty for returning the funds.  The hack has raised alarm in DeFi circles because it now means ETH that has been bridged to Solana may be unbacked.  Cross-blockchain bridges often work by taking an asset, such as ETH, and locking it in a contract to issue a parallel asset on the bridged chain.  It is not immediately clear what the ramifications for Solana lending markets and other protocols might be if the ETH issued by Wormhole cannot be bridged back to the Ethereum main chain and is now valueless.  In an interview with CoinDesk, George Harrap, founder of Solana DeFi platform Step Finance, said he expects Jump Capital, which purchased Wormhole developer Certus One in August 2021, to step in to backstop the hacked ETH. If not, he added, a number of Solana-based platforms that accept ETH as collateral may now be partially insolvent.  ""If nobody backs it and the coins are truly gone then Wormhole ETH is worth 0 and everyone who has a balance of it becomes worthless, DeFi protocols, users, everyone,"" he said.  In a follow-up tweet, Wormhole confirmed a total loss of 120,000 ETH and said that funds would be added to the bridge to backstop the wrapped ETH on Solana, though the team did not specify who would provide the funds:  Presciently, in a Reddit post in January, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin argued that bridges will not be popular in the future, due in part to risks to the backing of bridged assets:  CoinDesk has reached out to Certus One, the developers of Wormhole, and others for comment and will update with their response.

42396134,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0ojR,1643836896,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Bounce Pauses on Low Volume,"Bitcoin (BTC) traded lower on Wednesday after a brief price bounce over the past two days. Buying activity has been weak following the January sell-off, which is why some analysts remain uncertain about BTC's short-term price direction.  Market indicators such as volatility and trading volume remain low, indicating a lack of conviction among crypto buyers and sellers. ""Bitcoin’s seven-day volatility is now at the lowest level since November 2020,"" Arcane Research stated in a report. The firm expects short-term rises in volatility to remain limited as BTC trades in a tight range.  Still, a BTC breakout above $40,000 or breakdown below $30,000 could be a catalyst for a surge in trading activity.  ""Since the early November peak, there have been four marked, step-like drops in the crypto market,"" FundStrat, a global research firm, wrote in a Wednesday briefing. ""After each drop there has been a recovery averaging 8.9% leading into the next drop. A noticeable difference between the current recovery and the previous ones is the volatility,"" FundStrat wrote.  The firm noted that during the past three price recoveries bitcoin had an average true range (ATR, a volatility indicator) of 151, but the current recovery's ART is only 109.

42396160,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0olP,1643832581,Neopets Pitched a Metaverse Pivot. Fans Balked,"What’s crypto’s hottest play-to-earn, NFT-based pet game?  If you guessed Axie Infinity, you’re right – but the Neopets Metaverse team wants to change that. At least, that’s the stated plan.  The project, which launched last September, aims to bring the once-popular pet collecting game – which peaked in the early 2000s and has been on a slow decline ever since – into the Web 3 era.  According to an October 2021 Medium post, the Neopets Metaverse team plans to create a “vast immersive environment where players can interact” and establish a “sophisticated economy integrated on the Solana blockchain” where players can earn real money, all based on the original Neopets game.  It may sound like a dream come true for many of Neopets’ remaining die-hard players, but the Neopets Metaverse project has been received more like a nightmare. Fans of the original game have banded together to push back against the project, taking to social media and fansites to voice their complaints.  At first glance, the critics of the Neopets Metaverse project could be dismissed as blinded by nostalgia, hostile to any changes to the 25-year-old game many of them played as children. Many of the project’s detractors, too, seem inclined towards the knee-jerk negative reaction towards non-fungible tokens (NFTs) seen in many online communities.  The blowback has led to a changing of the guard among the project’s staff, current project leads said. And despite the Neopets Metaverse’s efforts to reform, fans still remain suspicious of the project – for what appear to be legitimate reasons.  Underwhelming NFT drop  In November 2021, the Neopets Metaverse team announced its upcoming NFT collection: 20,500 randomly generated Neopets that would, in theory, be compatible with the future Neopets Metaverse.  But after getting a less-than-enthusiastic reaction from fans, the team behind the project decided to slash the number of NFTs in its genesis drop from 20,500 to 10,500, with 500 NFTs reserved for the project team.  Despite the drop, however, the collection failed to sell out – only 4,225 NFTs were sold. The rest were burned, angering fans who requested NFT buyers be airdropped the remaining supply. Buyers took to Twitter to complain about the clunky minting process, a floor price around $240 to $960 and bots driving up prices within seconds.  The quality and style of the NFTs was also an issue. Herdy, a pseudonymous Neopets player who says he has been playing since 2001, told CoinDesk the NFTs were “very low quality and ugly looking compared to the majority of comparable customizations available on the classic site.”  While the NFT art may have been messy, the sale netted a clean $2 million for the Neopets Metaverse project, according to fansite Jellyneo.  A string of scandals  The shoddy quality of some of the NFT art was not the biggest issue for the Neopets Metaverse team, however.  Allegations swirled online that the Neopets Metaverse project had used art generated by a Neopets fan site called Dress to Impress (DTI) as an example NFT before the drop – and even that the DTI website was used to make all of the NFTs. Users pointed to the presence of a glitch unique to the fan site’s software in the image, and it was quickly taken down and replaced without an explanation.  In an interview with CoinDesk, project manager Danning Chen declined to comment on the incident, but sent a follow-up email from the project team saying the current Neopets Metaverse team was new, having made staffing changes in December 2021 after the sale of the NFTs.  “Some of the original team members that worked on the project have left already, we are looking into what happened,” the email read.  Fans of the project have demanded an acknowledgment and an apology from the Neopets Metaverse team, as well as from its owner JumpStart – the company behind a popular series of educational computer games for children.  JumpStart, which was acquired by Chinese gaming company NetDragon in 2017, did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment, but has verified the partnership with Neopets Metaverse as an official one in other interviews and on social media.  In addition to the allegations of art theft, the culture clash between crypto, which is often harsh and irreverent, and Neopets, which has cultivated a gentle, family-friendly atmosphere through the use of strict filters, has plagued the project.  Fans including Herdy have pointed out that a lack of moderation in the project’s Discord and occasionally antagonistic social media presence have failed to keep up the wholesome and welcoming culture of the original Neopets site.  “The project has fostered homophobia, racism and transphobia in their Discord,” Herdy wrote to CoinDesk, referring to an incident in the project’s Discord chat where an anti-gay slur was allowed to remain up for hours, and a moderator accused complaining users of “fudding,” referring to FUD, the popular crypto acronym for “fear, uncertainty and doubt.”  “[This] is especially damaging given that Neopets has a high LGBT+ membership,” Herdy added. “[They] have never apologized.”  Last October, the Neopets Metaverse Twitter account had to delete a tweet containing a “soyjak” meme mocking “NFT Hateoooors” after Twitter users complained it was offensive.  A roadmap to nowhere?  Neopets players might be willing to let bygones be bygones if the project succeeded in resuscitating their childhood favorite, but that’s looking increasingly unlikely.  In an updated roadmap released on Monday, the project team released details of its plans to take Neopets into the Web 3 era.  The project’s plans for the first and second quarters of 2022 are vague: hiring game developers, releasing a teaser trailer and telling fans about the plans for the game’s structure.  According to the roadmap, by the third quarter an alpha version of the game will be available for those with “priority access.”  These are lofty goals for a project that, according to Chen, currently has only five full-time team members.  The lack of resources appears evident with some cursory googling. A search for “cartoon fantasy village” pulls up the backdrop of the project’s website, a Shutterstock image that can be licensed for $12. It’s unclear if the team’s current roster includes a digital artist.  What does appear to be concrete in the team’s roadmap, however, are financial milestones: in the second quarter, a Medium post touts plans for a “private sale of native tokens to strategic investors and advisors.” There’s also a planned “initial metaverse offering (IMO).”  By next year, the project hopes to launch the beta version of the Neopets Metaverse game, as well as hold a “primary NFT sale of Neopets lands, where Neopians can expand their Neohome on their own plot of land, interact and traverse to other lands.”  When asked how the game would be funded, the Neopets Metaverse team told CoinDesk the initial seed investment would come from the NFT sale’s proceeds, “combined with additional investments from our mother company, NetDragon Websoft,” as well as funds raised from the IMO and “private sales to investors.”  Who is it for?  Many Neopets fans have voiced fears that this project looks a lot like a cash grab – if not an outright rug pull waiting to happen. If at best, it’s just a failed experiment, it wouldn’t be the first in the Neopets canon.  The brand has promoted and failed to deliver on a host of projects, including a mobile app (stalled indefinitely), an animated series (stalled) and even another crypto project – Neopets CryptoQuest, a short-lived, Ethereum-based trading card game from 2018 that died after a few months.  Fans like Herdy are outraged that NetDragon’s money is being used to spin up new projects while their original beloved game is on life support, held together with spaghetti code.  “Leeching money and resources away from the rest of the Neopets brand [could] potentially lead to things like the classic site being shuttered,” Herdy told CoinDesk. “It’s quite certainly the last thing fans of the Neopets brand want.”",NEGATIVE,없음,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/02/02/neopets-pitched-a-metaverse-pivot-fans-balked,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3e01b75ae4711db3e5829e05e2ab7d78ba9f3ff4-4610x3790.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396129,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0ohT,1643831143,Paradigm Offering 'Futures Spread Orderbooks' on Deribit and Bybit,"Paradigm, an institutional, over-the-counter investment firm, is now offering a feature that allows users to trade futures spreads as a single structure using a central limit order book.  The new ""futures spread orderbooks"" are now live on the crypto exchanges Deribit and Bybit, according to a tweet from Singapore-based Paradigm. Videos posted on the company's website show how the trades are executed.  A futures spread trade is an arbitrage technique where a trader takes two positions on a commodity to capitalize on a discrepancy in price. So a trader buys one futures contract and sells another with a different expiry date. Instead of trading the price of the underlying asset – in this case, bitcoin or another cryptocurrency – based on the investor's view of the future direction of the market, traders bet on the price difference between the two contracts.  Futures spread trading is considered less risky when compared with futures contracts, according to the CME, a U.S. commodities exchange.  However, there are still some risks associated with futures spread trading, especially when using high leverage, according to Cryptarbitrage, a Twitter user who says he creates content for Deribit Insights and has experience trading derivatives in crypto and traditional markets.  Cryptoarbitrage spoke to CoinDesk via a Telegram chat after being contacted via a Twitter direct message. He declined to disclose his identity.  “This new order book makes it easier and gives traders the ability to leave limit orders,"" Cryptarbitrage told CoinDesk. ""They are no longer restricted to either accepting or not accepting a dealer's quotes. They can now set their own price.”  “This should be useful for traders who want to trade the spreads themselves, but also very handy for traders rolling their positions from one contract to the next,” he added.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/02/paradigm-offering-futures-spread-orderbooks-on-deribit-and-bybit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ab31a1541a4b1571d282b197d7d7f4ed754d8fef-4082x3061.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Brett Tejpaul told MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor that increase in business has prompted an increase in the institutional group's size, from about a dozen people to 150. Institutions need to know they can transact their business in large volume, and that will be even more important in coming years, he added.  A far more recent emerging theme, he said, is retailers interested in non-fungible tokens (NFT). This may lead these companies into holding bitcoin in their treasuries, once they are comfortable with the concept, and then accept customer payments in crypto, said Tejpaul.  Tejpaul also noted institutions are getting comfortable holding stablecoins, from roughly $10 billion three years ago to $150 billion today. Stablecoins keep institutions in the cryptocurrency ecosystem during those times when they’re not comfortable holding bitcoin, he added, noting there was a marked increase in stablecoin usage at the same time as bitcoin’s plunge during December and January.  Michael Moro, CEO of digital prime brokerage Genesis, told Saylor his company’s derivatives business is about eight times larger than a year ago, with borrowing against bitcoin and borrowing to buy bitcoin also showing strong growth. He also agreed with Saylor there has been an “avalanche of hedge funds” entering the bitcoin space over the past year.  Genesis is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk's parent company.

42396123,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0ocY,1643829515,"Fed's Hawkish Pivot May Not Last, Bitcoin Analysts Say","As markets swoon in the face of the Federal Reserve's recent pivot to tackle inflation, some crypto analysts are already calling the U.S. central bank's bluff.  Bitcoin prices have plunged alongside stocks as the Fed moves to reverse nearly two years of emergency monetary stimulus. But some top crypto analysts argue that Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues may quickly back off from their new campaign to tighten monetary policy – due to worries that traditional markets, the banking system and the real economy can’t handle the higher borrowing costs.  The analysis gets at the heart of economists' debates these days over the Fed's willingness to maintain the hawkish stance if the economy starts to go into recession or if stock prices suddenly tank. It goes back to the ""Fed put"" – the notion that investors can count on getting bailed out by the U.S. central bank without having to worry about unlimited downside.  The theory is that bitcoin prices might jump if the Fed were to reverse course and halt the tightening or even start stimulating markets again to prevent a recession – and to preserve the soundness of the traditional financial system. The Fed is widely expected to start raising interest rates next month for the first time since 2018, and to keep tightening monetary conditions over the course of the year.  Even before the Fed gets going, some analysts are already starting to handicap when the U.S. central bank might start to ease up.  “I anticipate that we are to see some slowdown in” the pace of Fed monetary-policy tightening, said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at the foreign-exchange brokerage Oanda. “If there’s some cracks in the economy and the Fed goes slower, that is going to provide a spark here for bitcoin.”  During a press conference last week, Powell noted that the economy has reached the point – with inflation ticking up and coronavirus cases waning – when the time for extreme monetary stimulus has passed.  “The economy no longer needs sustained high levels of monetary policy support,” Powell said.  But he left himself ample wiggle room to maneuver in case the outlook changes.  ""Of course, the economic outlook remains highly uncertain,"" Powell said. ""Making appropriate monetary policy in this environment requires humility, recognizing that the economy evolves in unexpected ways. We will need to be nimble so that we can respond to the full range of plausible outcomes.  Big Wall Street firms aren't completely in sync on how fast the Fed will move to tighten monetary policy, but they're in agreement on the general trajectory: Bank of America predicts seven 0.25 percentage point rate hikes this year, while JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank forecast five and Morgan Stanley sees four.  Coinbase Institutional Research analyst David Duong said he's skeptical that the Fed will be able to keep cranking monetary conditions tighter if markets start to weaken.  He noted Powell's use of the term ""financial stability"" – often invoked by the Fed as a reason for loosening monetary policy. When the spread of the coronavirus in March 2020 sent global asset prices reeling, the U.S. central bank cited the threats to financial stability as a reason to pump trillions of emergency liquidity into money markets.  ""I heard the phrase 'financial stability' more than once,"" Duong told CoinDesk last week in a video interview. ""I take that as a signal that they are saying, We are concerned about financial stability, what’s happening in the market.""  No one knows for sure how much stock market decline the Fed can tolerate. Among analysts who spoke with CoinDesk, most guessed 20% to 30%.  “I doubt the Fed will act decisively,” Duke University finance professor Campbell R. Harvey wrote in email to CoinDesk,  Market expectations, he said, are that the Fed will hike interest rates by 0.25 percentage point in March and another percentage point over the rest of the year. He said ""that seems trivial"" considering that inflation is running around 7%, with the Fed's benchmark interest rate currently around 0.08%.  Garrick Hileman, head of research at Blockchain.com and a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics, said that inflation might prove to be less daunting, which could give the Fed more room to ease off.  “We are not in an extremely unstable inflation right now,” he said. “Many sectors are deflationary. Tech is deflationary. These are all forces helping the Fed manage inflation.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | RESEARCH,Angelique Chen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/02/feds-hawkish-pivot-may-not-last-bitcoin-analysts-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3bc70e001671729f1c59fb0756b0d33a1bc20779-1500x1126.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394328,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbXFT,1643827377,A Crypto Wallet by Any Other Name…,"What’s the right term for a cryptocurrency wallet? This was barely a discussion a few years ago, when a “wallet” almost always described a piece of local software or hardware that held the cryptographic private keys that control assets on a blockchain (that, or old-fashioned folding leather).  But that clarity has been eroded, largely thanks to rising regulatory pressure. Declarations from bodies like the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service have introduced terms like “unhosted wallet” and “non-custodial wallet” to distinguish user-controlled tools from “custodial wallets” – exchange accounts or other third-party services that hold crypto on users’ behalf.  Critics, however, argue that many of these novel, regulator-championed terms are misleading. The issue has been occasionally debated in the industry, but bubbled to the surface with new intensity in recent weeks thanks in part to the resurrection of a U.S. “unhosted wallet rule” first proposed late in the Trump administration. Broadly, the rule would require centralized exchanges to gather information about the users of software wallets before crypto can be sent to them from the exchange.  That’s just one example of a larger regulatory push to erode the intended usability of crypto systems. It’s closely tied, for instance, to attempts to expand the Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) “travel rule” to cover crypto transactions – a measure already adopted in Switzerland.  What you call a crypto wallet may seem trivial in the face of such government attacks. But it has huge stakes for shaping perception of cryptocurrencies – and, in turn, regulation. Some terms for conventional software wallets, such as “unhosted wallet,” are misleading, confusing or have vaguely negative connotations. Others, like “user-controlled wallet,” draw much clearer attention to the core advantages of cryptocurrencies.  Below, I’ve assembled a list of seven different terms for a standard cryptocurrency wallet. Drawing on comments from an array of industry luminaries, I’ve unpacked what each term is really saying – and whether that implicit message benefits or harms public perception of crypto.  Finally, note that the decentralization of wallets isn’t entirely binary. Many standard software wallets rely on some sort of third-party infrastructure, and some crypto advocates argue the only way to truly self-custody is to run a node yourself. Those nuances aren’t central to the regulatory debate (at least not yet), so they won’t be addressed below.  Here, then, are your candidates.  ‘Unhosted crypto wallet’  Terrible, at least from an industry perspective. All this tells me is what it’s not: setting up a binary that implicitly suggests that a “hosted wallet” is somehow better. It is also arguably deeply deceptive. Some commentators have even argued there’s no such thing as a “hosted wallet.” Your crypto at an exchange like Coinbase is associated with an account that usually does not connect to an individual on-chain wallet at all. That’s one reason it’s sometimes difficult or costly to send crypto from an exchange account, and for the saying “not your keys, not your crypto.”  Your exchange account balances instead reflect an internal balance sheet maintained solely by the exchange, partly to avoid paying on-chain transaction fees. The actual funds are more or less just in one big pool managed by the exchange. This arrangement goes a long way toward explaining the prevalence of exchange hacks because huge blocks of crypto can be snagged by compromising just one or two big exchange-controlled wallets.  ‘Self-hosted wallet’  Much better!  This one’s good because it emphasizes user power and responsibility. This suggestion came in second in an entirely informal and unscientific poll I conducted on Twitter.  If you want to nitpick, you might argue “hosting” isn’t really the right term for what a wallet does. While a software or hardware wallet does store your keys, it otherwise doesn’t store data or make it publicly available, as when a server “hosts” a website.  ‘Self-custodied wallet’  Similar to “self-hosted” but more precise.  “Any wallet that enables a user to custody their own keys and is trust-minimized should be classified as ’self-custody’,” argues Gregory Rocco, co-founder of Spruce Systems, “whereas exchange wallets should be ‘exchange-controlled.’ It has the right level of detail … I wouldn't call my bank account with Chase self-custodied, [and that’s] how we should treat exchange wallets.”  The team at Spruce spends a lot of time thinking about wallets and self-custody: It is developing the Sign In With Ethereum (SIWE) standard, which aims to use wallets such as MetaMask to replace centralized identity services like Google.  ‘Non-Custodial Wallet’  Though surprisingly widely used, this one’s just confusing because it can be read in two different senses. It’s meant to spell out that a standard crypto wallet doesn’t involve a custodian because a custodian is specifically a third party that protects an asset for you. But, as written, it could be easily misunderstood as suggesting users themselves don’t have custody of their crypto in this kind of wallet, which is exactly the opposite of the case.  In effect, then, this is a phrase that obfuscates the difference between an exchange account and a standard wallet. Using this phrase in public communications is, intentionally or not, undermining self-custody as an important element of crypto culture.  ‘Software Wallet/Hardware Wallet’  These were the top vote-getters in my Twitter poll. They have the major advantage of being specific and descriptive without implying a value judgment (though see below on that). Relatively few people, I think, would mistake an exchange account accessed through a web browser for a piece of software or hardware.  These terms also help cast regulatory efforts in a clearer light. The policies regulators are pushing for could result in mandatory surveillance features for all possible versions of a piece of software, which Americans in particular are simply not going to accept. A coordinated campaign to reinforce the distinction between a “software wallet” and an “exchange account” could offer significant long-term benefits in the regulatory debate.  ‘True Wallet’  This term is not widely used – in fact I don’t think I’d ever heard it until I saw this from Twitter user @porteaux. But I’m quite fond of it.  This has the advantage, first, of being accurate. I’m not certain exactly when the term “wallet” was coined (it’s not in the Bitcoin white paper), but it was very early in the evolution of crypto. Describing custodial services as “wallets” of any sort came much later.  More importantly, I like that this term has a baked-in value judgment. If software or hardware wallets are “true” crypto wallets, then an exchange or other custodial service is by necessity offering a “false wallet” – and no one wants a fake. “True wallet” highlights that other uses of the term may be employed in bad faith. Which they probably are.  Just plain ‘wallet’  The true alpha terminology, though I fear the window to defend it is closing. Podcaster Stephan Livera floated the suggestion last week, and it was co-signed by cryptography pioneer Adam Back.     In this usage, only a tool that holds keys locally is a crypto “wallet” at all, and any other modifiers or caveats are suspect. In this schema, your crypto on Coinbase or Kraken isn’t in a wallet at all, just an account. Unfortunately, it may be too late to reclaim this rhetorical high ground after years of obfuscation by regulators and (to a lesser extent) exchanges.  In the long term, which of these terms becomes dominant will shape public perception – and while there’s no obvious evidence, it’s safe to assume that regulators chose their terms very carefully to stack the deck in their favor. To counter their efforts, the crypto industry should favor terminology that emphasizes user control and independence – values that Americans in particular would be quite unhappy to see eroded by new rules, perhaps even if they’re not crypto users themselves.  This isn’t necessarily a conscious process. Terms that contain subtle, implicit bias can have a major role in shaping public sentiment, even (perhaps especially) among people who are barely paying attention. As crypto confronts an intensifying fight for its right to exist, it’s vital the broader public understands exactly what regulators are trying to take away.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,David Z.

42396120,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0oXd,1643826786,Federal Reserve Bank of NY Lays Out Possible Stablecoin Scenarios,"Stablecoins are growing so fast that regulators are starting to worry about their potential to undermine traditional bank lending.  So this week, researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York published an academic-style study in which they tried to estimate the impact on bank lending under three different regulatory frameworks for stablecoins.  According to the researchers, the circulating supply of stablecoins jumped fivefold to nearly $130 billion as of September. (The amount has since grown to at least $155 billion, according to data from Skew.)  ""If stablecoins were to see broad adoption throughout the financial system, they could have a significant impact on the balance sheets of financial institutions,"" the New York Fed researchers wrote.  ""With appropriate safeguards and regulations, stablecoins have the potential to provide a level of stability that is on par with traditional forms of safe value,"" the paper stated.  The researchers set out to ""analyze several plausible scenarios in which reserve-backed stablecoins see widespread adoption in the financial system.""  Here are those scenarios:  Scenario 1: ""Narrow bank""  Under this framework for stablecoins, physical cash would be tokenized and issuers would be required to back their stablecoins with central bank reserves.  The impact on bank lending – the researchers used the terms ""credit provision"" and ""credit intermediation"" – would largely be minimal. When it comes to deposits, however, this framework could have a negative impact because the deposit-backed funding for lending would be reduced as regular commercial bank deposits would move to separated accounts at the central bank.  “A narrow banking framework … minimizes the risk of 'runs' on stablecoins but can potentially reduce credit intermediation,” the paper stated.  Because the stablecoins would effectively act like a pass-through central bank digital currency, their pegs – fixing the price to $1, for example – would come with guaranteed stability. In times of financial panic, however, large migrations of regular commercial bank deposits into narrow bank stablecoins could disrupt lending and could increase the Fed’s balance sheet to accommodate the demand from stablecoin issuers.  Scenario 2: Two-tiered intermediation  In this scenario, stablecoins would be backed by deposits held at commercial banks. And then the banks could lend the stablecoins to new borrowers. For this to work, the treatment of stablecoin deposits would have to be the same as that for non-stablecoin deposits when it comes to regulatory limits.  Contrary to the narrow-bank approach, large inflows into stablecoins could have a positive impact on lending, while the overall balance sheets and asset holdings of commercial and central banks would remain unchanged.  Scenario 3: Security holdings  This framework would require cash-equivalent securities to be held as reserved collateral for stablecoins. The central bank's balance sheet would shrink slightly with lower banking reserves. The impact on lending would be neutral because commercial bank deposits would be recycled back into the banking system.  Conclusion  The researchers concluded that the “two-tiered"" system could help to maintain traditional forms of bank lending even as stablecoins grow.  The ""narrow-bank"" framework, meanwhile, could lead to ""credit disintermediation"" but might """"bring the most stability,"" according to the paper.",NEUTRAL,없음,FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/02/federal-reserve-bank-of-ny-lays-out-possible-stablecoin-scenarios,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4c5b8c6143ceb700cba12e7d698f043f94c26b77-1200x801.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394323,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbWux,1643826524,"This Super Bowl, Don’t Trust Celebrity Crypto Endorsements (Don’t Trust Yourself, Either)","Global crypto exchange Binance is warning against celebrity crypto endorsements during the upcoming National Football League Super Bowl championship game, according to AdAge. In a social media teaser of a new Binance ad campaign, National Basketball Association player Jimmy Butler encourages viewers to steer clear of celebs and instead “trust yourself” and “do your own research.” At least two crypto commercials, from FTX and Crypto.com, are expected to run during the big game on Feb. 13.  There’s significant irony to using a celebrity influencer to warn against celebrity influence – but the message itself seems positive, right? Celebrities taking big checks to give fake investment advice should be tarred and feathered. “Do your own research” is hard to argue against as a principle.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The problem, unfortunately, is that the “you” doing the research is a gigantic idiot.  I certainly don’t mean you individually – perish the thought. You’re reading CoinDesk so I’m sure you’re very sharp. But statistically, there’s a lot of idiocy floating around, and a lot of people willing to take advantage of it. Many grifters, fakes and other bad actors have been drawn to the crypto industry, and the “do your own research” ethos can leave their marks particularly vulnerable.  The average American, to pluck just one indicator out of a hat, reads at a seventh- to eighth-grade level. Telling that person to “do your own research” on crypto could lead them down some deep, dark rabbit holes.  That isn’t just a roll of the dice: The most disreputable crypto projects often spend a lot of money on marketing and public relations, so people who actively “do their own research” are probably more likely to be scammed than those who just bought some random PFP (“profile pic”) on OpenSea because Jay-Z told them to. Part of that is thanks to data harvesters like Facebook and Google. Using Google to search for something like “best crypto investments” is the equivalent of covering yourself in fish guts before diving into shark-infested waters.  See also: Don’t Listen to Celebrities Shilling Crypto, Says Binance Celebrity Ad  For instance, all the people who invested in the OHM system did their own research ( it’s down 95%https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/Olympus). So did everyone who invested in Wonderland (whose chief financial officer was secretly a career financial con-man). Observing the Wonderland community in particular over the past few days, it seems clear many buyers were not just financially but emotionally invested in the project, creating a cult-like sense of uncritical support even after clear malfeasance had been admitted.  That drives home a disturbing parallel: “Do your own research,” in so many words, is also core to the ethos of the QAnon conspiracy theory movement. Much like QAnon, many corners of the crypto universe capitalize on people’s desire to have secret knowledge, to know something before the masses – to be able to see themselves as smart, whether or not they actually are. For QAnon, the supposed “secret” is a fabricated child-abduction ring (itself a tragic distraction from real child exploitation). In crypto, the secret is usually some supposed technical or incentive innovation that in many cases is just obfuscating a Ponzi scheme.  The key, in the end, is to “do your own research” the right way, and that’s, frankly, extremely difficult in crypto. First, there’s the significant intellectual challenge of grasping how blockchain works. It’s a long road and there are no shortcuts if you want to be able to genuinely evaluate whether a particular project can actually do what it’s promising. A lot of initial coin offerings circa 2017-2018, for instance, exploited knowledge gaps by pitching use cases where blockchain or cryptocurrency simply weren’t relevant. (CoinDesk’s Learn series is a good way to start honing your self-defense skills.)  That kind of blunt misrepresentation is slightly less common today – more often, bad DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) or decentralized exchange projects hide their real intent in hypercomplex tokenomics. Here again “do your own research” is problematic because it presumes either high-grade code analysis skills or a level of transparency that simply doesn’t exist in the crypto world.  If you’re investing in a publicly traded stock, you can easily download years’ worth of financial reports that can be at least somewhat trusted thanks to regulators like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. With that backstop, you can indeed do your own research. It’s why r/WallStreetBets can occasionally spot things professional analysts miss. The data is available, and fairly trustworthy.  But there’s no equivalent in crypto, despite some transparency efforts. Everything a project writes about itself, from information about founders to the goals of the project and even some financial data, can be completely made up. The people behind the worst projects actively avoid jurisdictions where they might face consequences for any of this, or simply conceal their identity. And as the recent Wonderland fiasco makes clear, if you only know a project's team by their cute pseudonyms, you haven’t really done your research at all.

Greenidge said in a statement that fourth-quarter revenue rose to about $44 million compared with the third quarter’s $35.8 million.  The Dresden, New York-based miner also said its hashrate climbed 17% to 1.4 exahash per second (EH/s) as of Dec. 31, 2021.  While Greenidge mined about 609 bitcoins in the quarter, a drop of 16%, the price of bitcoin touched a record high near $69,000 during the period.  Fourth-quarter adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization is expected to be $18 million to $20 million, the company said. That’s lower than the third quarter’s $21.2 million.  The miner said it had $85 million in cash and short-term investments, of which only $2 million was in cryptocurrency holdings, implying it potentially monetized most of the coins it mined, a practice that was mentioned in its recent prospectus filing.  Greenidge has been recently in the middle of energy debate, as Senator Elizabeth Warren questioned its energy consumption and the environmental effect of its operations.  The stock has fallen about 27% this year, sliding along with other crypto miners as bitcoin prices experienced a sharp sell-off from November’s highs.

ADP put the blame on the Omicron coronavirus variant for the first negative jobs figure since December 2020. The loss of 301,000 jobs in January is a particularly massive turnaround from December 2021’s 776,000 gain.  The leisure and hospitality industries accounted for more than half of January’s job losses, posting a decline of 154,000.  Stock, bond and crypto prices aren’t really responding, however, perhaps because the Biden White House had been prepping markets this week for some ugly job figures.  However, one bad report caused by a spike in COVID-19 cases isn't likely to push the Federal Reserve off of its plan to begin hiking interest rates in March. S&P 500 and Nasdaq stocks remain modestly in the green. The 10-year Treasury bond yield is down one basis point at 1.79%. Bitcoin has dipped a bit, now off 2% to $37,700, with ether lower by 3% to $2,680.  ADP's report is a warmup for Friday's government report on January payrolls. For the moment, economists continue to expect a gain of 150,000 jobs, down modestly from December’s 199,000 advance, and with the unemployment rate holding flat at 3.9%.

42375356,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7XGR,1643812538,New Chainalysis Report Suggests NFT Crime Doesn’t (Always) Pay,"The booming non-fungible token (NFT) market might look like an attractive place for crypto criminals looking to make a quick buck, but new research from Chainalysis suggests NFT crime is less lucrative – and more difficult – than other types of crypto crime.  In a report published Wednesday, the blockchain research firm examined two types of NFT-related crime – wash trading and money laundering – that occur in the Ethereum NFT ecosystem.  The NFT market exploded in popularity last year. In 2021, Chainalysis traced $44.2 billion worth of crypto sent to NFT-related smart contracts, up from just $106 million the year before.  And as the crypto market grows, so, too, does crypto-enabled crime such as ransomware attacks and scams. In 2021, crypto crime hit an all-time high of $14 billion, and criminals increasingly turned to new areas like decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to make money. But criminals looking to NFTs to strike it rich might find it a tougher nut to crack than expected.  “It's not a very good idea to get into crime in NFTs because it's expensive,” said Kim Grauer, Chainalysis’ head of research. “It's hard to guarantee you'll be profitable if you wash trade, and if you want to use [NFTs] to launder money, we can trace it, and you will be able to see who's in possession of the NFT. There's things that make the NFT space unattractive for crime.”  Wash trading – the practice of buying and selling the same asset to create artificially high trading volume and manipulate the asset’s price – has become common on NFT marketplaces like LooksRare.  Chainalysis found 262 NFT traders who had sold an NFT to a self-financed address over 25 times, which is Chainalysis’ threshold for when NFT sales are more likely to be wash trading than not. The research firm found that more than half actually lost money, as gas fees racked up and their wash trading failed to generate interest from real buyers.  However, for successful wash traders, the NFT marketplace can be profitable: The 110 successful wash traders Chainalysis tracked made a collective $8.9 million last year.  Money laundering through NFT marketplaces also picked up steam in 2021, with a collective $2.4 million sent from wallet addresses connected to illicit activity by Chainalysis. However, this was only a tiny fraction of the total $8.6 billion in crypto-based money laundering Chainalysis tracked last year.

If at the end of 2021 on a weekly timeframe you could see how buyers are actively keeping the price, in the first month of 2022 ETH was easily merged. The critical point of $3000 from which the last local fall wave was formed in September 2021 is under the control of sellers. Trading volumes are low and the prospect of the fall continuation is up to $1700. However, will sellers be able to continue to put pressure on the ETH price without correction? In the weekly timeframe, we see that after trying to fix below $2300, buyers showed character. The $2300 mark is the middle line of the $1700-$3000 consolidation range. In this range, the ETH price was traded from May to July 2021. At the moment, we do not expect a strong growth wave and the maximum target is $3300. The fact is that in addition to the important range of $3,000, in which in the past there was considerable interest from buyers, the trend line was lost. Buyers kept this trend line throughout 2021. Therefore, given these facts, one should expect another fall wave in the ETH market globally.

The &apos;Securities Acts&apos; were designed to officially form the agency and adopt rules that required issuers of securities to transmit information through the mail to investors containing financial and operational disclosure so informed investment decisions can be made by the People. Other global disclosure frameworks were adopted soon after. The Securities Acts were a legislative response to the speculative &apos;rug pulls&apos; of the 1920s, a common tactic that involved pooling capital and purchasing large amounts of shares of stock. The perpetrators would then spread information to pump the price before dumping it on the unsuspecting public who had little information to rely on other than tips from stockbrokers. The Securities Act of 1933 provides rules for disclosing information for new issues of securities. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 provides rules for ongoing disclosure after those securities are issued and distributed to the public.

42375351,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7X8t,1643810435,"Dune Analytics Raises Crypto’s Latest Meme Round: $69,420,000","One of Ethereum’s most popular data visualization and analytics platform is gearing up for expansion with a massive fundraising round.  On Wednesday, Dune Analytics announced the close of a $69,420,000 round at a $1 billion valuation. (The meme-flavored sum follows crypto exchange FTX raising $420,690,000 last October.)  The round was led by Coatue, a venture behemoth that, until recently, hasn’t been active in the cryptocurrency space. However, according to Dune CEO Fredrik Haga, the investment firm – which has big bets on OpenSea, Alchemy and Dapper Labs – was aggressive in courting the platform.  “We had not made a single slide or Excel sheet – they simply came to us, had extreme conviction in what we were doing, and had done a lot of outside-in research, and gave us an offer we couldn’t refuse,” he said.  The Dune team is now plotting expansion with the goal of becoming “the only place you need to go for data in the space” – a potentially lucrative niche, given the inherent data-richness of blockchain technology.  ""What we have here is a public back end where anyone in the world can deploy applications, and that creates data,"" Haga noted. ""And then with Dune, anyone in the world can analyze that data. That’s why the opportunity is big, and that’s why we’ve gone down the open route.""  Expansion plans  On the immediate roadmap are plans to expand to other blockchains, adding additional tooling such as application programming interface (API) access and the launch of a new data platform that will allow users to compare datasets across chains.  Haga envisions the company developing much in the mold of Github, a popular freemium software development platform.  “You take open access as the core and free product, and then you add on premium services for closed organizations on top of that,” he said.  Data platforms have been a particular target for venture capital funds as of late.

Grayscale, which has $38.2 billion in assets under management, said the fund will be administered by the U.S. Bank and trade under the ticker GFOF. Foreside Fund Services, LLC, is the ETF’s distributor.  The BGFOF index was launched in January in conjunction between the two firms and tracks the performance of 22 financial services companies in the digital economy. The list of companies includes Silvergate Capital (SI), PayPal (PYPL), Coinbase Global (COIN), Block (SQ), Robinhood Markets (HOOD), Argo Blockchain PLC (ARB) and more. The index, which can include payments, exchange, asset management, hardware, blockchain/tech and mining companies, is rebalanced every quarter.  With the launch of its first equity ETF, Grayscale is now broadening its product range away from strictly cryptocurrency investing and giving investors exposure to mainstream markets. GFOF will give investors access to “new pools of capital” while reducing the need for costly intermediaries, said Grayscale in a press release.  “While Grayscale has established itself as a global leader in digital currency investing, the future of finance demands a much broader mandate,” said Grayscale Investments CEO Michael Sonnenshein in a statement.  “This product [GFOF] draws upon our historical strengths, while kicking off the next stage of our evolution as an asset manager that helps investors build portfolios that can stand the test of time,” added Sonnenshein.  Separately, Grayscale continues to wait for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve the conversion of its flagship Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a bitcoin spot ETF.

42410938,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtSyg,1643805000,Just-In-Time Liquidity: How MEV Can Enhance DeFi on Ethereum,"What is MEV?  Behind the scenes of most major blockchains, shadowy super-coders and the bots they build are using the transparency of blockchains and the transaction fee market to their advantage. By watching a database of all pending and unconfirmed transactions called the mempool, the bots are able to pay higher transaction fees to slip in their own transaction in an order that is profitable, often at the expense of decentralized finance (DeFi) users.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum 2.0 and its sweeping impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to Valid Points here.  According to the Ethereum Foundation, Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) is the catch-all phrase for “the maximum value that can be extracted from block production in excess of the standard block reward and gas fees by including, excluding and changing the order of transactions in a block.” More specifically, arbitrage, liquidations, frontrunning and sandwich attacks are all forms of MEV in its current state.  MEV is not inherently bad and exists in any transaction fee market-driven chain with open access to the mempool. Decentralized exchanges and lending protocols even rely on MEV to arbitrage pools and liquidate undercollateralized loans in a competitive and efficient manner. The ability to order transactions within a block also casts a dark cloud over MEV because searchers are able to front run buy orders just to simultaneously sell on the trader after the order goes through. Searchers may earn an extra percent on the transaction, but it is completely at the expense of the trader who overpaid for the asset they received.  Concentrated liquidity and MEV  Flashbots, a development organization focused on mitigating the negative externalities of MEV, co-hosted a Twitter Spaces with the Uniswap team in late January to talk about “Just-In-Time” (JIT) Liquidity Provision, an increasingly popular MEV strategy. Just as it sounds, MEV “searchers” scour the mempool for large pending exchange swaps and provide liquidity to the associated pool before the swap is confirmed. This allows the searcher to gain a large cut of the trading fees only to subsequently pull that liquidity out in the same block.  This MEV tactic has proven more profitable on concentrated liquidity decentralized exchanges like Uniswap v3. Version 3 allows liquidity providers to supply capital within certain price ranges, theoretically improving trading depth around current prices and increasing fees for active liquidity providers. MEV searchers deploy their LP within a tight price range of the trade, taking up a significant amount of the trading fees and making the transaction worthwhile.  The strategy employs a non-atomic approach to MEV where searchers are exposed to delta risk, the chance that an asset drops in price. Therefore, the searcher must have some short-term outlook on the market because their portfolio was rebalanced from the trade, and future price volatility could quickly take away the profits made via trading fees.  Potential benefits and drawbacks of increasingly sophisticated MEV  The Uniswap team foresaw the potential of JIT liquidity on v3, but wanted to see how the strategy affected traders and liquidity providers in actuality. Should the tactic come to be a net negative for the protocol’s users, Uniswap considered implementing capital punishments for liquidity providers that deposited and withdrew liquidity in the same block. However, JIT liquidity has been largely positive for traders who have seen increased liquidity in their trading range, minimizing slippage.  The product lead at Flashbots, Robert Miller, posted an insightful thread on JIT liquidity and an on-chain reference example. Miller highlighted the benefits JIT liquidity brings to traders and how it differs from sandwich attacks, even while it employs a similar strategy. Furthermore, LPs have been able to remain profitable even despite JIT liquidity. Because the MEV searcher cannot utilize this strategy in a single atomic transaction, it is not risk-free and may not fit the bots risk profile.  A large concern is that MEV will continue to benefit the few at the expense of everyday DeFi users. Passive liquidity provision will continue to become more difficult if JIT liquidity strategies prove profitable, and trading on DEXs will be less desirable if users are being frontrun and sandwich-attacked. We run into some of the same problems as we see in traditional finance, with order flow selling and high-frequency trading.  However, at both the protocol and application level MEV can and is being mitigated. Flashbots has brought the misunderstood sector to light and is building products to combat the drawbacks felt by everyday users. For example, an off-chain marketplace where searchers can compete for transaction order ensures that on-chain gas wars become less likely. Over the next several months we may get a clearer picture of who is affected by MEV and how users can protect themselves.  Pulse check  The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain over the past week. For more information about the metrics featured in this section, check out our 101 explainer on Eth 2.0 metrics.  Disclaimer: All profits made from CoinDesk’s Eth 2.0 staking venture will be donated to a charity of the company’s choosing once transfers are enabled on the network.  Validated takes  A Coinbase engineer has assured users the exchange is working on a solution for staking service client concentration. BACKGROUND: The conversation around client diversity continues to heat up as Prysm-style validators take an increasingly large cut of block production. Community members look to hold staking providers like Coinbase and Kraken accountable for the health of the network. Large exchanges are in control of around 30% of validators and have heavily leaned on the usage of Prysm, adding unnecessary risk to the network.  The Ethereum Foundation released a breakdown of validator distribution thresholds in light of client diversity issues. BACKGROUND: Ethereum’s multi-client nature allows the network and validators to protect themselves against software failures. Ideally, no client would be run on over 33.3% of the network’s validators, assuring that a bug within any of the several clients could not disrupt finality. However, if a client makes up over 66.6% of the network like Prsym, it has the potential to finalize bugs and cause avoidable chain splits down the road, financially punishing anyone using the majority client.  OpenSea ended January with over $4.9 billion in NFT trading volume on Ethereum for the month. BACKGROUND: Non-fungible token trading came back with a vengeance in January, with OpenSea volume 44% higher than the previous most-active month. While we are only one month into the new year, OpenSea is on pace to bring in nearly $1.5 billion in revenue during 2022. The figure is even more impressive when accounting for the $900 million in volume done on recently launched platform, Looksrare.  Blockscan introduced off-chain wallet-to-wallet communication on Etherscan. BACKGROUND: Communication between wallets has been very difficult and has required on-chain transactions in the past. Blockscan allows wallet users to remain anonymous but also to reach out and respond to other wallets within the Etherscan website.

The deal could also give the crypto-focused bank an advantage over other stablecoin issuers because the bank's stablecoin will be issued in a ""regulatory friendly way"" and can be integrated with the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN).

42375389,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7XKD,1643799573,Trader Joe's Native Coin Climbs as the DEX Unveils 'Modular Staking',"JOE, the native token of Avalanche-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Trader Joe, is leading a rally in DEX coins after the protocol announced ""modular staking"" – a system that gives token owners three independent ways of staking their holding.  Messari data shows the JOE token has advanced 58% in the past seven days, outperforming DEX giants like UNI, CAKE and CRV by a significant margin. The cryptocurrency was changing hands at nearly $1.40 at press time, representing a 2% drop on a 24-hour basis.  ""The token has been drawing demand probably due to its modular staking and the new primitive they are launching,"" Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. ""The coin is relatively undervalued in terms of the revenue the DEX produces relative to its market cap.""  Staking refers to the process of locking up coins in a blockchain for a specific period to contribute to the security of the blockchain in return for network rewards.  Most DEXes supposedly bring value to their coin by giving token stakers a share of revenue or higher liquidity-provider (LP) rewards. According to Trader Joe investor GBV Capital, however, those methods don't accrue value and act only as incentives ""to prevent people from dumping the token.""  The investment firm said in a blog post published on Monday that value accrual happens through utility, that is by attaching as many use cases to the token as possible and, more so, by introducing modularity to the DEX token. That involves breaking down the system into multiple pieces so that potential yields from the token's multiple use cases aren't interlinked.  ""People want their DEX tokens to be modular in their function, and they want to price those functions independently,"" GBV Capital noted. ""This is exactly what Trader Joe is doing.""  Modular staking  Trader Joe's modular staking structure comprises three independent staking pools, which can be accessed with three different tokens: rJOE, sJOE and veJOE. Users can get each of these coins by staking the JOE token.  rJOE, a non-transferable token, is a gateway to Rocket Joe, a launchpad facilitating better liquidity acquisition and price discovery for new projects on the Avalanche blockchain. According to the official blog, the launchpad addresses issues like token listings on DEXes being front-run by bots and price manipulation seen in a low liquidity environment.  Rocket Joe went live on Tuesday. Users can now stake JOE for rJOE and deposit rJOE into a launch pool in return for liquidity provider tokens from the launch.  Trader Joe plans to roll out sJOE and veJOE later this month. Users can stake JOE for sJOE and get a share in Trader Joe's revenue. Similarly, users can stake JOE into veJOE and earn boosted yields. ""veJOE holders can increase their JOE yield farming rewards by up to +150% (2.5X),"" the official explainer published last month said.  Essentially, modular staking allows users to choose between three staking pools or various combinations of the three. The new tokenomics has retired Trader Joe's original staking mechanism xJOE.  ""They are splitting up the staking in protocol fee, boosted yields and launchpad access – normally, everything is bundled together in one staking token,"" Henrik Andersson, co-founder and chief investment officer of Australia-based crypto-asset investment firm Apollo Capital, told CoinDesk in a LinkedIn chat. ""While it's definitely something new and interesting, it's still quite early to gauge its eventual success.""  While the JOE token has outperformed the DEX heavyweights in the past seven days, the platform is lagging the likes of Curve, PancakeSwap and SushiSwap in terms of total revenue earned.  Trader Joe has raked in a revenue of $4.2million in seven days, just behind SushiSwap's tally of $6.1 million.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MINING | TRADING | TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/02/trader-joes-native-coin-climbs-as-the-dex-unveils-modular-staking,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2da666edc8206bbebe5a39e7efd8b098f6ce3438-2476x1374.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Under the proposed new rules, crypto exchanges will be able to list more than a dozen tokens at once, Bloomberg said, citing people familiar with the matter. The current screening process takes six months or more.  The Japanese Virtual Currency Asset and Exchange Association (JVCEA) is responsible for approving token listings for crypto exchanges. The Financial Services Agency (FSA), Japan's regulator, has allowed the association to run the process on its behalf. The existing system makes it harder for new entrants to compete with incumbents if they want to get many tokens approved.  JVCEA members have complained that the cumbersome process, which applies even to coins that are popular around the world, is limiting the industry's growth, Bloomberg reported. Τhe FSA has also instructed the self-governing body to clarify its approval process, according to the report.  The new rules will look to make the listing of popular coins easier. Tokens that have been traded in Japan for over six months and are listed on at least three local exchanges will qualify, Bloomberg reported. The association is also looking at how it can improve its approval process for coins that aren't traded in Japan.  The JCVEA is ""working … to further refine cryptocurrency assessment,” Satoshi Hasuo, the association's chairman, said on Jan. 1.  The JVCEA is also expected to introduce new requirements for crypto transfers by April to enforce the Financial Action Task Force's travel rule, which requires customer data to be associated with any transaction, according to an FSA memo.

42375360,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7XDv,1643796339,Indian Budget Provision Allows Government to Define NFTs,"The Indian government may be seeking to define just what is or is not a non-fungible token (NFT).  Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the nation's budget on Tuesday, revealing it will tax digital assets at a 30% rate. A different section, however, is raising more alarm within the crypto industry.  The section in question defined ""virtual digital assets,"" the phrase the government used in the budget to describe cryptocurrencies or NFTs. According to the budget, ""for the purposes of this clause, (a) 'non-fungible token' means such digital asset as the Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, specify.""  This clause can be interpreted in three different ways. It is possible the government has proposed a law that gives it the authority to decide what is or isn't an NFT. Every NFT would have to go through a certification process and the power to select, qualify, classify or label a collectable as an NFT will be in the hands of the government.  The second, gentler interpretation is the government will certify categories of NFTs. For instance, a memorable moment in Indian history or a portrait of a celebrity may be certified as historical moments or celebrities, respectively, but a digital artwork by an unknown artist may not be certified/specified at all.  The third, most lenient interpretation is the government has labeled an NFT as a ""virtual digital asset"" but has retained the power to say this is not an NFT. In other words, the government has retained the power to exclude through a notification.  At least three senior representatives of the industry confirmed that their legal teams are trying to make sense of this clause.  A senior legal representative at a major Indian crypto exchange explained that reading the fine print as is suggests the government is saying it will specify or certify each and every NFT.  Shehnaz Ahmed, senior resident fellow and lead (Fintech) at Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy, explained how both cryptoassets and NFTs fall under the definition of ""virtual digital asset"" although the government has treated NFTs separately from cryptocurrencies.  ""Unlike the definition of cryptoassets, which is clearly laid out in clause 3(b) of the bill, what qualifies as an NFT will be set out in a notification to be issued by the central government. One has to wait to understand if the notification sets out the broad features of NFTs or specific categories of NFTs,"" Ahmed said.  Bibin Babu, co-founder of Colexion, a marketplace for NFTs, said he was ""OK"" with the government's role in certifying either each NFT or categories of NFTs.  However, Babu believes only one interpretation is possible. Babu said ""it is impossible"" for the government to ""specify"" each NFT when ""millions of NFTs are minted every day.""  ""They will categorize it like an artwork, nostalgic memorabilia or sporting moment, etc.,"" Babu said.  A representative from another exchange that focuses on trading rather than NFTs, who requested anonymity,said the clause was ""striking"" and that ""the question is who or which department will define"" or specify what is an NFT and what isn't.  ""Legal teams will take time to dig deeper into what the clause means since at the moment the focus is on asset and remittance tax clauses and consequences,"" the person said.  Anirudh Rastogi, managing partner at Ikigai Law and who regularly advises several stakeholders on cryptocurrency-related policy issues, believed ""the interpretation that they will list out all NFTs is impractical.""  ""No other regulator has tried to define NFTs. The bill regrettably provides an over-broad definition. They have recognized NFTs but not defined them. It is good that they have left it undefined. They realized this is nuanced and required deliberation so let's leave it for later,"" said Rastogi.  Some industry leaders interpreted that the wording is by design to give the government power to exclude or stay away from certain NFTs, but that for the moment anything selling as an NFT falls under the purview of the government and its 30% taxation policy.  Shivam Thakral, CEO, BuyUcoin was one such industry leader and said the government has ""broadened its spectrum"" to account for ""future advancements"" they may want to stay away from.  A senior lawyer who has worked with the government on crypto in the past confirmed India's government has retained extraordinary power, which gives it the ability to discourage certain artworks.  ""For instance, the government may want to stay away from currencies in vogue on Silk Route. [It] may specify only the most popular NFTs, the most frequently traded or they may go by volume, class or type,"" the lawyer said.  Edul Patel, CEO of Mudrex, a crypto asset management platform, also believes the government has used a ""very broad definition as an exclusionary mechanism,"" kind of a ""catch all statement"" that includes all NFTs as a virtual digital asset but gives the government the power to exclude some NFTs at a later stage.  ""Details are missing, language is loose and more will unfold as we get more documents from the finance bill,"" Patel said.  India's Finance Ministry did not return a request for comment.

The Tor Project steers the development of the privacy network and web browser Tor. On Jan. 31, the team published the results of its biggest fundraising drive, which took place over the last few months of 2021.  Of $940,000 raised, 58% of donations were in cryptocurrencies. This is a much larger percentage compared to 2020, when donors sent $58,000 in crypto.  ""It's clear that cryptocurrency folks are extremely philanthropic, and that they care deeply about privacy online,"" Tor Project fundraising director Al Smith told CoinDesk.  Of the crypto donations, 68% ($371,000) where in the form of bitcoins, 28% ($154,000) were in ether, 2% ($9,000) in DAI and 1% ($7l) was in monero, a privacy coin.  The cryptocurrency community is more privacy-conscious than most, going back to Bitcoin's creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, who hid his or her real identity when launching the digital currency system in 2009.  The Tor network plays a big role in improving cryptocurrency privacy as well. Bitcoin core nodes provide the option of sending traffic over an encrypted privacy network to hide the node's IP addresses, shielding the node's location. According to the Bitcoin network tracking site Bitnodes, more than 51% of nodes run over the Tor network.

ZEC cleared the $100 mark, rising as much as 6% over 24 hours and 12% so far this week, according to CoinGecko.  The Zcash protocol is one of the original privacy tokens, launching in October 2016 as a fork of Bitcoin.  In November, Electric Coin Company, the team behind the project, announced it was transitioning Zcash to proof-of-stake by 2023 and planned to release an official wallet.  The market also reacted favorably to ZCash’s compliance plan. The team said the protocol is fully compatible with global anti-money laundering and counter-terror financing standards as well as Financial Action Task Force recommendations like the ""travel rule,"" which requires keeping customer data with any transaction. In a blog post, the team said the majority of transactions occur on FinCEN-registered exchanges in the United States. FinCEN is a unit of the Treasury Department.  Privacy protocols and mixers have been in the news recently; for instance, over $30 million in digital assets was stolen from Crypto.com and mixed through Tornado Cash.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Tornado Cash’s co-founder Roman Semenov said that law enforcement tends to focus on obtaining IP addresses from infrastructure providers because these can be tied back to a name via subpoenas instead of privacy tokens.

The proposal will increase block size by a further 8KB taking it from 72KB to 80KB,” Input Output said in a tweet.  Block are batches of transactions that are confirmed and recorded on a blockchain. Larger sizes mean more transactions can be included in each batch, but it can affect transaction times and overall network capacity.  A separate proposal was additionally triggered to increase the performance of Plutus, the smart contract platform of the Cardano blockchain. Input Output said script memory units per transaction – or the amount of data that can be included in a single transaction – on Cardano would now increase to 14 million from 12.5 million.  The changes are expected to improve the performance of applications built on Cardano, while increasing overall network capacity, Input Output said.  The proposals are in line with a broader plan to increase transactional volumes on the Cardano network as it moves towards becoming a decentralized finance (DeFi)-focused blockchain. DeFi refers to financial services that depend on smart contracts instead of third parties.  SundaeSwap, the first DeFi decentralized exchange (DEX) on Cardano, went live in January. The DEX offers several trading pools that consist of native Cardano tokens, such as SUNDAE, Cardano’s ADA and metaverse token PAVIA, among several others.  However, at the time of writing, swaps on SundaeSwap were slow. “The network is extremely congested at the moment.

The explosive success of games like Axie Infinity, which has sold over $3 billion in NFTs, looks like the beginning of a new era where gaming meets crypto - and gamers can finally reap extraordinary rewards for their talents. The advantages of NFTs for gaming are massive: They turn in-game assets (characters, costumes, weapons, and more) into unique and valuable crypto tokens that can be traded and collected for profit. The Play to Earn (P2E) model enables the most talented games to earn NFT rewards for their gaming performance and victories - a first in the history of global gaming. They represent an unprecedented and highly attractive asset class for investors, who can benefit financially from the growth of the most successful gaming ecosystems and the intrinsic rarity of each NFT. A new game is about to take the sector by storm - Edensol. Built on the highly versatile and powerful Solana Blockchain, Edensol is the ultimate action role-playing NFT game developed by Golem House. While new NFT games are being released in growing numbers, the Golem House team developed Edensol to stand out in the space, thanks to its potential for long-term growth and a positive gamer experience.
