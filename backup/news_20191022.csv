The certification was provided by Bahrain-based Shariya Review Bureau (SRB) and indicates that the Algorand platform adheres to the tenants of Islamic law. It could open up the platform and its features to a global network of observant Islamic investors estimated to be worth more than $70 billion, according to a 2017 study by Malaysia International Islamic Financial Center.  “Our vision at Algorand has always been inclusivity,” Algorand CEO Steve Kokinos said in a statement. “I am excited that forward-thinking Islamic enterprises will now be able to realize new business opportunities on a platform that is congruent to their finance guidelines.""  Sharia compliance can be complex for investment vehicles of any kind. To secure approval they must not profit from activities banned under sharia law, including gambling and alcohol, or accrue interest on loans, another banned activity.  It's unclear what hurdles Algorand jumped to win SRB’s certification, but the platform, which launched in June, plans to retain approval as it continues to develop. Every dapp built on the platform will be reviewed by the SRB for sharia compliance.  “We stand ready to support the future ambitions of the users of Algorand in the Islamic financial market,” SRB CEO Yasser S.

Morgan Creek revealed exclusively to CoinDesk that the same institutions from the first fund, including two public pension funds, have increased their investments in the second by more than twofold.  Together, Fairfax County’s Virginia’s Police Officer’s Retirement System and Employees’ Retirement System are investing a combined $50 million in the second fund, up from $21 million in its first fund that closed in February.  Commitments from other institutional investors including Wakemed Health and Hospitals, an insurance company and a university endowment make up the remaining $10 million of the tranche.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Morgan Creek Capital partner Anthony Pompliano said the decision was taken to split the full $250 million raise into tranches, with no date yet set for its close.  “We hear folks saying institutions aren’t interested, but this initial close along with the conversations we’re having with tens of other institutions, shows that there is no lack of interest.”  The second fund will be primarily focused on seed investments in equity, like the first fund, which included investments in what Pompliano called “blockchain infrastructure” companies like Bitwise and BlockFi.  “When you see the quality of the LPs in this fund, it speaks to the work that these infrastructure companies have done over the last 18 to 24 months,” Pompliano said.  For its first fund, Morgan Creek raised $40 million, with stronger-than-expected investor demand leading the company to exceed its initial fundraising target of $25 million.  Combined with the Digital Asset Index Fund, a crypto index fund managed by Bitwise Asset Management, Morgan Creek has more than $100 million assets under management.  “We raised the first fund for specific investments,” Pompliano said, while the $250 million fund is “more institutionally sized.”  “For the LPs that are investing with us, this is a size that they’re used to.”  Anthony Pompliano via CoinDesk archives",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/22/pension-funds-put-50-million-into-morgan-creeks-new-blockchain-fund,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/878d9f5011d6f3d9199e7117ff844ca171a659d2-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382892,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tHIH,1571771710,"Trump Administration Popped 2017 Bitcoin Bubble, Ex-CFTC Chair Says","SAN FRANCISCO — The Trump administration acted to deflate the bitcoin bubble of 2017 by allowing the introduction of futures products, a former official said Monday.  Christopher Giancarlo, who left the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) at the end of his five-year term as chairman in April, told CoinDesk in an interview:  ""One of the untold stories of the past few years is that the CFTC, the Treasury, the SEC and the [National Economic Council] director at the time, Gary Cohn, believed that the launch of bitcoin futures would have the impact of popping the bitcoin bubble. And it worked.""  In a speech at the Pantera Summit in San Francisco on Monday, Giancarlo elaborated further, saying bitcoin's dramatic price run-up in December 2017 was the first major bubble following the 2008 financial crisis. That's why the Trump administration acted in concert to address it in a pro-markets manner, he said.  Bitcoin futures listed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the CBOE Futures Exchange (CFE) were announced by the CFTC on Dec. 1, 2017 and went live on Dec. 18. Bitcoin's price peaked at nearly $20,000 one day earlier, on Dec. 17, before falling dramatically in subsequent weeks.  ""We saw a bubble building and we thought the best way to address it was to allow the market to interact with it,"" Giancarlo told the crowd gathered at the Ritz-Carlton on Nob Hill.  Of course, there are different views on what ultimately brought bitcoin prices back down to Earth, reaching lows in the $3,000 range in late 2018. However, Giancarlo cited research by the San Francisco Federal Reserve that also credits the introduction of bitcoin futures for reining in a market driven by optimists.  Without shorts, a market has no pessimists. ""If you do believe it's a ridiculous price but you don't own, there's no way to express that view,"" Giancarlo told CoinDesk, adding:  ""If you don't have that derivative, then all you've got are believers [and] it's a believers' market.""  The lack of easy ways to short has been cited by other researchers as propping up prices in other crypto assets.  ""The CFTC staff handled it strictly on procedural grounds, but at the leadership level I communicated with Treasury Secretary [Steven] Mnuchin and NEC Director Gary Cohn, and we believed that, should bitcoin futures go forward, it would allow institutional money to bring discipline to the value of the cash market,"" Giancarlo told CoinDesk. ""And that's exactly what happened.""  Lessons from '08  The bitcoin bubble of 2017 must be viewed in the context of the financial crisis of 2008, Giancarlo said.  In 2008, the former regulator was running GFI Group Inc., an over-the-counter trading desk on Wall Street that became one of the largest exchanges for credit-default swaps – the financial instrument that wreaked havoc on U.S. markets.  Giancarlo said:  ""Coming out of the 2008 financial crisis, the legit criticism of regulators was along the lines of: Where were they during the expansion of the real estate mortgage bubble, and why didn't they take steps to pop that bubble when they could have?""  That view informed regulators acting quickly on bitcoin's ascent, he added.  To Giancarlo, the lesson was clear: Regulators mustn't be complacent when faced with a bubble – but they must act in a way that keeps markets free. In the case of 2017, permitting bitcoin futures presented just such an opportunity.  Giancarlo concluded:  ""I believe it shows the power of markets to bring discipline to prices.""

42382901,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tHR5,1571771117,Zuckerberg to Tell Congress: Libra Can Fix 'Failing' Financial System,"Mark Zuckerberg will tell Congress that Libra can bring financial services to the world's 1.7 billion unbanked.  And if Libra doesn't do it, he said, China's new central-bank crypto will.  Facebook's CEO released his written testimony a day before his scheduled appearance before the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, stating that Libra is envisioned as a global payments service that can help people send money more easily.  ""The current system is failing them,"" Zuckerberg said. ""The financial industry is stagnant and there is no digital financial architecture to support the innovation we need. I believe this problem can be solved, and Libra can help.""  Notably, he highlighted Facebook's role – and the backlash the company has faced – in his remarks, writing:  ""I believe this is something that needs to get built, but I understand we’re not the ideal messenger right now. We’ve faced a lot of issues over the past few years, and I’m sure people wish it was anyone but Facebook putting this idea forward.""  Zuckerberg cautioned that the U.S. might lose its ""financial leadership"" on the world stage if Libra is not allowed to launch, noting that ""China is moving quickly to launch similar ideas in the coming months.""  He added that Facebook will not be part of launching Libra ""anywhere in the world"" until ""all U.S. regulators"" approve of the project, and will support delaying any launch until this has happened.  The CEO also emphasized that Facebook does not ""expect to be leading"" any efforts to further Libra's development given that the project's governing council, the Libra Association, has now been formally signed into existence with 21 members (including Calibra, a Facebook subsidiary, and Breakthrough Initiatives, a venture capital fund that Zuckerberg is involved in).  Zuckerberg claimed that Libra has no intention of competing with sovereign currencies or with participating in monetary policy, writing that it ""is the province of central banks.""  ""[The Libra Association] will work with the Federal Reserve and other central banks responsible for monetary policy to make sure that is the case,"" he wrote.  The group even expects regulators to prohibit Libra from entering this space, he said, writing:  ""We expect the regulatory framework for the Libra Association will ensure that the Association cannot interfere with monetary policy. Libra is also being designed with economic security and stability in mind, and it will be fully backed through the Libra Reserve.""  Zuckerberg even suggested that Libra may be better able to fight financial crimes than the existing system, noting that law enforcement agents can analyze on-chain activity and check know-your-customer information.  The Facebook CEO will be the second Facebook official to defend the cryptocurrency project before Congress, following his company's head of blockchain, David Marcus. Marcus testified before the Financial Services Committee (and its Senate counterpart) in July, articulating similar points about monetary policy.

42382905,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tHW7,1571768706,US Lawmaker Introduces Bill Classifying Stablecoins as Securities,"Congress may consider a bill to classify stablecoins – cryptocurrencies whose values are pegged to a fiat currency or other assets – as securities.  In a draft bill published Tuesday, Rep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Texas) introduced legislation to the House Financial Services Committee to regulate stablecoins under the Securities Act of 1933, seeking to provide clarity in an area the bill suggests lacks regulatory guidance.  The bill states:  ""The market value of such digital asset is determined, in whole or in significant part, directly or indirectly, by reference to the value of a pool or basket of assets, including digital assets, held, designated, or managed by one or more persons.""  The proposed legislation appears to be a response to the Facebook-led Libra cryptocurrency, which the social media giant introduced in June 2019. The cryptocurrency is meant to be a stablecoin pegged to a basket of fiat currencies.  Lawmakers have urged Facebook and its partners not to launch Libra – and indeed, to halt all development entirely – until regulatory questions around the project and its governance can be resolved.  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify before the committee on Wednesday.  If signed into law, the rule would give the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) jurisdictional authority over all stablecoins and their issuers.  The bill's introduction does not mean it will ever become law: First, it would need to be voted out of committee, passed by the House of Representatives, taken up and passed by the Senate and signed into law by the U.S. President. It is unclear what sort of support the bill has at present.  However, former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Gary Gensler believes Libra already looks like a security, testifying before the Financial Services Committee in July that the project looks similar to an exchange-traded fund, which does fall within the SEC's purview.  The bill was introduced jointly with another draft bill sponsored by Rep. Michael San Nicolas (D-Guam), which would bar national security exchanges from listing a security by an issuer if the issuer or an executive affiliated with it received compensation in the form of a managed stablecoin.

42382899,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tHOZ,1571766332,New York's Financial Regulator Is Reviewing the Controversial BitLicense,"The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) is revisiting its controversial virtual currency license, the regulator's head said Tuesday.  Speaking at Georgetown University's Institute of International Economic Law during DC Fintech Week, NYDFS Superintendent Linda Lacewell said the agency was looking into the BitLicense, which requires any companies conducting cryptocurrency transactions with New York residents to be licensed to operate within the state – even if the companies are based elsewhere.  The license, considered the toughest such state regulation in the country, has long been unpopular with blockchain startups, who complain of onerous paperwork and long approval times. Kraken, an exchange headquartered in San Francisco, chose to leave New York rather than comply. The Seattle-based Bittrex exchange was forced out of New York earlier this year after failing to secure a BitLicense.  Lacewell told Georgetown's Chis Brummer:  ""This is a good time to take a look, a responsible look and see how our regime is fitting the current market and ... what if any adjustments should we think about making to continue to adapt to sort of a changing industry ... that's going to be one of the things that [we do].""  But she warned the audience not to ""get too excited"" about what the review might result in.  Speaking to the media after her talk, Lacewell said the regulator is comparing the cryptocurrency industry when the BitLicense was first implemented in 2015 and how it has evolved since then.  ""How has the industry grown? Has it matured in any way? And I don't want to get too specific, but you know, it's a good time for a second look,"" Lacewell said.  The current regulatory regime is ""working well,"" and the existing regulation will be retained during this review. But Lacewell said NYDFS wants to hear from industry participants to see what improvements, if any, the agency could implement.  She cited the 22 companies which already have virtual currency licenses, adding that NYDFS continues to receive applications for the license.  Since first being introduced by previous NYDFS Superintendent Benjamin Lawsky, the state financial regulator has issued more than 20 licenses and a few trust charters, allowing exchanges, bitcoin mining firms, bitcoin teller machine startups and custodians the ability to store and transact cryptocurrencies in the Empire State. NYDFS awarded only six licenses between June 2015 and June 2018, but has since added 16 in the 20 months since.  Lacewell did not say when the regulator's review of the license would be completed, or what specifically industry participants can expect to see at the close.  ""Maybe there's some things that could be within a license's discretion, maybe there could be all kinds of permutations and our mind is open,"" Lacewell said Tuesday, concluding:  ""With any new and emerging industry, it's good to take a close look and see if there's any aspect maybe [where] there's something we need to add.""

42382909,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tHb9,1571760007,Why Bitmain Is Building the World's Largest Bitcoin Mine in Rural Texas,"The Takeaway  Bitmain, the world’s largest maker of bitcoin-mining computers, chose an old Alcoa aluminum-smelting plant in Rockdale, Texas, for a new bitcoin mine.  The Beijing company says the plant has an initial power size of 25 megawatts but will be expanded to 50 megawatts and potentially 300 megawatts.  Texas has an abundance of power resources, so the new plant is unlikely to affect local electricity prices, say officials.      ROCKDALE, TEXAS – In the concrete-and-iron shell of a mostly-abandoned Alcoa aluminum smelter, Chinese and Canadian executives in business suits mingled with local residents in cowboy hats and baseball caps.  They assembled, just outside the town of Rockdale, in the central-Texas countryside, to celebrate the opening of a new bitcoin-mining plant constructed by Beijing-based Bitmain, the world’s largest manufacturer of computers designed to mine cryptocurrency.  County Judge Steve Young, the top elected official in rural Milam County, kneeled to snap photos. Tao Wu, an Arizona-based Bitmain executive sporting a thin bolo tie, gave a tour to curious local residents and journalists, shouting over the whirring of thousands of cooling fans.  “There’s going to be jobs, there’s going to be revenue,” Rockdale Mayor John King told the entourage during a ribbon-cutting ceremony. “We’re going to see great things coming in the future.”  Many of the locals on the tour had little if any idea how bitcoin mining worked, or even what bitcoin was.  “How do I monetize that?” said one person on the tour. “It’s not tangible.”  Texas, long known for its bountiful commodities, from cotton to crude oil, is now drawing a new breed of speculators in search of bitcoin, invented just a decade ago.  Bitmain says its operation in the state, which is flush with cheap electricity and plenty of space, represents an alluring opportunity – especially after prices for the cryptocurrency more than doubled this year to about $8,200.  In 2018, the company inked a deal with local officials to set up a bank of computers inside the Alcoa plant to mine bitcoin. Thousands of processing units run 24 hours a day, sending trillions of numbers per second via the Internet to mine bitcoin. The configuration has roughly the height and width of a railroad boxcar but extends in length for three football fields.  Bitmain declined to disclose the cost to build its new facility or the total bitcoin that it will produce. It did reveal that the plant during its initial phase will use 25 megawatts of electricity, the same amount as about 20,000 average U.S. households. The company says it plans to build out the plant to use 50 megawatts, and that eventually capacity could reach 300 megawatts, making it the world’s largest bitcoin mine.  Cryptocurrency-industry officials familiar with the technology say a 50-megawatt bitcoin mine would cost about $80 million to $100 million to build. Using the rated specifications on Bitmain’s Antminer S17 Pro mining computers, along with the website CryptoCompare’s mining profitability calculator, the Rockdale facility could generate an estimated $73 million of revenue per year, based on current prices. The only main input for these mines is electricity, and among U.S. states, Texas has the fourth-lowest power costs for industrial customers, according to government data.  The project was initiated last year, then shelved in early-2019 after bitcoin prices tumbled roughly 75 percent from their 2018 highs. As prices rebounded this year, Bitmain rushed to start up production.  “Once the price turned around, we ramped up,” says Clint Brown, 54, a former construction contractor, who now serves as a Bitmain project manager. “And it was like, 'hurry up, we need to get this done.'”  The new Texas facility is Bitmain’s largest-ever mining project to date, the company’s managing director for marketing, Bill Zhu, said in an interview under a shady tree outside the nearby Rockdale Country Club. The company’s signature product is its line of Antminer computers. Officials said the new Rockdale site is named Dory Creek, after the ant genus Dorylus, which includes driver ants from southern Africa.  Zhu responded to a concern expressed by some local residents that the new facility might quickly be shuttered if the bitcoin market suffers a downturn; people in these parts are all too familiar with commodity cycles.  “We really can find some good resources in North America, and then we pick up Texas, and we think these resources are good enough to invest in for the long term,” he said, adding:  “Our investment is not so sensitive to the bitcoin price. We don’t care so much how much it is next month. We care three years from now how much it is.”  The project has caused a stir in Rockdale (population: 5,595) which was hit hard in late-2008 when the giant Alcoa smelting facility closed down, leading to the loss of more than a thousand jobs.  On Friday morning, a group of former Alcoa workers assembled for morning coffee and breakfast at Lee’s Landing, a diner where the walls are adorned with country implements including a pitchfork and set of stirrups. A sign in the bathroom reads, “Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day. Teach a man to fish and he will sit in a boat and drink all day.”  Locals skeptical  One of the men at Lee’s, Royce Hudson, 73, said he got out of the Marines in November 1967, returning to central Texas and a job at the Alcoa smelter. He worked there for the next four decades, becoming a furnace operator, until he retired in 2008 when the facility closed, he said.  These days, he laments the fate of the local community, where the next generation is finding jobs harder to come by, and many people endure long commutes to work in Austin, Round Rock, Temple and Bryan-College Station.  Hudson says he’s happy that Bitmain is investing in the community, though he admits to knowing very little about what they do: “People are a little skeptical, because nobody really understands how it works,” he says, declining to have his coffee refilled. “We’re just not technically advanced enough.”  One of his former colleagues from the plant remarked that he couldn’t understand why there was nothing shipping out of the new plant, in the way that aluminum ingots used to issue forth from the old smelter.  The reality is that bitcoin mines represent a new type of industrial facility, with a glaring absence of heavy machinery and spewing little to no pollution, aside from the sizable emissions from the associated power generation. The output -- the mined bitcoin -- is delivered virtually, and almost instantaneously.  In some other states where bitcoin mining projects have gone in, including Washington, residents have complained that their monthly electricity bills shot up because of the added demand on the local grid.  Texas, by contrast, has a big enough electricity market — the biggest in the U.S. — that it can absorb new users. The state’s total annual power consumption is more than 50 percent higher than that of second-place California, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  Cheap power  Power prices are held in check by the state’s abundant local supply of natural gas, used to fuel generators, as well as by the relative isolation of the state’s electric-transmission network from the rest of the nation’s, on a grid known as the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. For the most part, whatever gets generated in the state, stays in the state. It doesn’t hurt that most Texas cities and towns feature a competitive electricity market, so businesses and households can shop around for a good deal.  Greg Pendley, president of CGP Solutions, a Houston-based energy consultant who helps big wholesale power purchasers find suppliers, says he often arranges deals for governments where the contract size can range from 5 megawatts to 8 megawatts. His point was that the Bitmain account is quite large.  The project has another unique attribute, he noted: “100 percent load.” Unlike some factories or government offices that might throttle back on power usage at night, when workers go off shift, Bitmain’s computers are constantly working.  “With this kind of industry, they’re looking for bitcoin, so they don’t make money if they’re not running,” Pendley said in an interview at the plant, where he joined the tour.  The facilities are light on employment compared with big factories or auto-assembly plants whose personnel can easily run into the thousands. Bitmain currently operates the Rockdale mine with a staff of fewer than 50 people.  “Once you get it up and running, it doesn’t take that many guys,” says Sheldon Bennett, chief operating officer of the Canadian company DMG Blockchain Solutions, which manages the new plant under a contract with Bitmain.  King, the mayor, said in an interview that the project looked pretty good to him, even after Bitmain won tax abatements from the county government.  It’s all in the name of economic development — a well-honed instinct in a business-friendly state like Texas that has never been shy about monetizing its natural resources for profit.  “If they’re housing people locally, and they’re shopping locally, we’re going to benefit,” King says. “It’s the first step in trying to regrow our economy.”  Images via Brad Keoun",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/22/why-bitmain-is-building-the-worlds-largest-bitcoin-mine-in-rural-texas,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6d7706275a1b7878726d02811b66c79da995d085-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In an interview with the Financial Times on Tuesday, CEO Ralph Hamers said the Libra project’s unresolved regulatory issues place a degree of risk on banks, as “gatekeeper[s] to the financial system.”  Hamers said the potential for Libra users to evade anti-money laundering standards and facilitate ""financial... crime"" raises questions for banks to “take measures and exit the client, or not accept the client.” Adding, “[T]hose are discussions you would have to have.”  In recent weeks, several prominent payments operators – including Visa, Stripe and Mastercard – have exited the non-binding letter of intent to join the Libra Association. However, Hamer’s statement today, is the first signal Libra’s regulatory risks speak to the project's lead Facebook as a bankable client.  A Facebook spokesperson said:  “From the beginning, we’ve said we’re committed to taking the time to get this right.

As a member of the Libra Association, we will continue to be a part of this dialogue to ensure that this global financial infrastructure is governed in a way that is reflective of the people it serves. Facebook will not offer Libra through its Calibra wallet until the Association has fully addressed regulators’ concerns and received appropriate approvals.”  “We are such a large, regulated institution that you don’t want to risk anything,” said Hamers. “We’ve said we’ll take a look and see how this develops.”  ING photo via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,OTHER,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/22/facebook-risks-banking-ties-over-libra-concerns-says-ing-exec,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f44270461047f92f13f325cd6a7236c56cce91b2-1500x859.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382903,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tHTb,1571755201,FinCEN Director Warns of 'Hard Time' for Crypto Firms That Don't Follow Law,"There is no ambiguity: crypto startups must follow U.S. anti-money-laundering (AML) laws or else suffer the consequences, said the nation's top AML regulator.  Kenneth Blanco, director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), warned the crypto industry Monday to take heed of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and other AML regulations when setting up businesses – because his agency certainly will.  Blanco, who spoke at Georgetown University as part of the first day of DC Fintech Week, told moderator Chris Brummer that companies have no excuse for not knowing the law.  ""What we tell everybody is if you're going to innovate, you better make sure that you're complying with your regulations prior to executing that innovation or prior to going to market,"" Blanco said. ""You better make sure that that happens because frankly ... you don't get to build it and then everybody comes around over it.""  He went on to add:  ""You have to make sure that you comply with the law first and then you can execute and get to market. Otherwise that's not happening ... I'll tell you if you can't comply with your BSA, you're going to have a problem ... you must comply and we as a regulator, as the primary regulator and the administrator of the BSA, we will make sure that you do and you're going to have a hard time if you don't.""  FinCEN won't accept that a company ""can't"" comply with the law either, he said. Any firms which do not believe they are able to fulfill the requirements in the BSA should not come to market, Bianco said.  ""That's what our expectation is going to be moving forward,"" he said.    Blanco's comments come at a time when industry observers expect enforcement actions around money laundering, due in part to a recent joint statement FinCEN published with the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission.    'Exciting' yet 'scary'  Warnings aside, Blanco praised the idea of innovation, though he warned of potential national security risks throughout his speech.  ""Some of it is really exciting,"" he said. ""The good is, wow, we can really protect society in many different ways or enjoy more job growth based on these kinds of inventions and ideas.""  On the other hand, it's ""scary"" how some of these same new tools can be used by bad actors, he added.  ""Like any innovation, you have to be careful because sometimes those people who show up when you're innovating are the wrong people and the people who are trying to exploit it for the gaps that are there so you have to keep that in mind,"" he warned.  These malicious actors are what inspired laws like the BSA, he said. Society would want to protect the elderly and other groups that are susceptible to cyber fraud and other digital crimes.  FinCEN is not anti-technology, Blanco later added. The agency is technology-neutral, and despite his warnings to the industry, he believes that tech should continue advancing – though he reiterated it should be developed responsibly.  ""Innovation ... must be responsible and it must be reasonable. You can't just build a car that only goes 190 miles an hour and say 'change the speed limit,' it's not going to work that way,"" he said, concluding:  ""Your car is going to have to adapt. Otherwise, it's not coming on the road, bottom line, and that's the message.""

42382895,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tHKn,1571752841,Facebook's Marcus Says China Wins With Digital Renminbi if US Nixes Libra,"David Marcus, Facebook’s top executive on the Libra project, said China will create a digital currency system that could be entirely out of reach for U.S. authorities.  Marcus warned that Washington risks “having a whole part of the world completely blocked from U.S. sanctions and protected from U.S. sanctions and having a new digital reserve currency,” according to an interview with Bloomberg News.  ""The future in five years, if we don’t have a good answer, is basically China re-wiring"" a large part of the world ""with a digital renminbi running on their controlled blockchain,"" Marcus said.  China has been stepping up its efforts to push forward with its Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) since Facebook’s unveiling of Libra in June.  Chinese central bank officials have emphasized that one of the goals for China’s cryptocurrency is to preempt the rise of Libra that would reinforce the dollar dominance in the international financial system.  While Libra would be pegged to a basket of fiat currencies, excluding China’s renminbi, one of the five reserved fiat currencies accepted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for international transactions.  China’s DCEP had been in the works, but the project's development accelerated after Libra was announced.  The People’s Bank of China appointed Mu Changchun to lead the Research Institute on Digital Currency in September and detailed a proposal to launch and distribute the national coin among major Chinese commercial banks.  Facebook’s crypto initiative has met with resistance from the U.S. Senate and the Federal Reserve, since it was announced in June. Five major partners, including PayPal, MasterCard and Visa, withdrew their support this month due to the business and regulatory challenges.

Sirer is talking about his soon-to-be-launched proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain, Ava.      “[Ava] is almost feature-complete with [its own] codebase. We’re hoping to go public with a testnet soon, within the next month and mainnet sometime between December and February,” said Sirer.      Ava will be comprised of multiple different “subnetworks” able to be uniquely coded to support different types of decentralized applications (dapps).      “Part of the interesting aspect of the Ava platform is that it gives you a very modular infrastructure for developing any kind of functionality you want,” said Kevin Sekniqi, chief protocol architect at Ava Labs. “When you launch a chain on Ava, you get this blank state where you can import any additional functionality like the ethereum virtual machine.""      As Sirer suggests, these independent blockchain worlds can be coded to host unique privacy guarantees, be compliant with regional laws, or fulfill specific data storage requirements.      Such flexibility is what differentiates the platform from other blockchains that have come before it.      “[Ava] is top of its class and it’s going to show the world exactly what this [blockchain] space needs,” said Sirer.      While affirming that proof-of-stake was the superior consensus protocol, Sirer added that Ava is in a class of its own.      “All of these PoS protocols that have been proposed today rely on the same foundation and that foundation has been poorly specified. It has many shortcomings compared to what PoW gives you out of the box,” said Sirer, adding:    “If there were to be a single winner, we are the best-positioned team to [win].”    Emin Gün Sirer image via YouTube",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/22/watch-ava-blockchain-founder-plans-to-launch-in-december,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ca1fd9c6785290c971ae7c2b806668561f59d3e6-1336x678.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382902,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tHSL,1571745627,Bitcoin IRA Is Letting Customers Lend Out Their Crypto Retirement Funds,"Bitcoin IRA will soon allow customers to lend their retirement assets for interest.  The firm, which provides digital asset individual retirement accounts (IRAs) is partnering with digital currency trader and lender Genesis Trading to offer interest on cryptocurrency and cash holdings that customers want to lend out, including bitcoin, ether, XRP, litecoin, and zcash.  The program will be launched in November with a limited number of participants on a first-come, first-served basis, and annual interest rates will vary based on lending coin and term length.  Bitcoin IRA declined to define a limit, but chief operating officer Chris Kline told CoinDesk that the firm aims to have the product available to anyone over the next six to seven months.  Kline said:  “We’re breaking new ground here, and we want to make sure clients understand everything and that it works well.”  The product is part of the company’s goal to eliminate annual custodial and monthly wallet fees for customers, he added. Yet, the firm wouldn’t reveal estimates on what interest rates would be.  “We’ll be able to offer more details on interest yields when we have an actual result,” Kline said.  “You’ll see some groups offer up to 8 to 12 percent interest. They often have asterisks next to those numbers … those rates are more in the 2 to 3 to 4 percent range. You’ll see someone deploy a 12 percent rate on bitcoin for three days.”  Bitcoin IRA chose Genesis because of the lending firm’s track record for being able to take on new clients.  Currently, Bitcoin IRA has processed more than $350 million in investments for more than 4,000 clients. Genesis has so far lent out a cumulative $2.3 billion in cryptocurrency and cash.  The product expansion is a deepening of Genesis’ relationship with Bitcoin IRA, which was already using Genesis’ over-the-counter trading desk.  “They are the largest digital IRA provider that we are aware of, and I think that we always want to be working with the leaders in the space,” Martin Garcia, co-head of sales and trading at Genesis, told CoinDesk.  Moving forward, despite legal battle  Bitcoin IRA’s partnership with Genesis comes despite the fact that the pension plan provider is embroiled in a lawsuit with Kingdom Trust, a Kentucky-based trust custodian that supported its product in 2016.  Kingdom claims that Bitcoin IRA has been using deceptive practices to get customers to switch from Kingdom Trust to BitGo, a qualified custodian with which Bitcoin IRA partnered in June.  Jason Anderson, president of Kingdom Trust, told CoinDesk:  “Clients have been surprised to find that their account is being transferred to a new custodian. In a lot of cases clients have chosen to reverse that decision.”  On Friday, a Kentucky federal judge dismissed Kingdom’s claims with prejudice, and Bitcoin IRA has filed a motion that the claims should proceed in South Dakota, where it filed its countersuit.  Despite the suit, Bitcoin IRA hasn’t stopped releasing products. In early September, the firm announced facial recognition for authentication of transactions. Later last month, it announced crypto swaps from bitcoin into ether without delays in settlement.  By next year, the firm aims to make its accounts open to a wider customer base by removing it’s $3,000 account minimum and replacing it with an automatic minimum monthly savings increment. While the firm doesn’t have a set estimate yet, Kline said that $50 a month might be a “realistic estimate.”  Kline said:  “It’s our biggest rollout.

42382908,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tHZt,1571742026,"Bitcoin May Rise Toward $8,800, Short-Term Cross Indicates","View  Bitcoin is looking north, with the hourly chart reporting a golden cross.  Key resistance at $8,820 could be put to test over the next few days.  On the downside. $7,800 is the level to beat for the bears.      A widely tracked short-term bitcoin price indicator has turned bullish, strengthening the case for a test of key resistance above $8,800.  The cryptocurrency's 50-hour moving average (MA) has crossed above the 200-hour MA, confirming what is popularly known as ""golden cross"" – a bullish indicator.  MA studies are based on backward-looking data and tend to lag prices. A golden cross, therefore, is widely considered as a lagging indicator, especially when it appears on longer duration charts. However, the crossovers on the hourly and other short duration charts follow prices more closely and are thus more reliable as trend indicators.  For instance, BTC drew bids and rose from $8,150 to $8,820, extending the recovery from $7,800 following the Oct. 9 golden cross on the hourly chart.  On similar lines, the latest bull cross may accelerate the ongoing recovery rally, pushing prices higher to $8,820 – a bearish lower high created on Oct. 11.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,280, representing a 0.53 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  Hourly chart  As discussed, the 50- and 200-hour MAs have produced a golden cross, bolstering the bullish setup, as indicated by the inverse head-and-shoulders breakout.  The chart is also showing a bull flag breakout – a continuation pattern which accelerates the preceding rally.  The flag breakout has opened the doors for $8,700 (target as per the measured move method).  The bullish case is supported by an above-50 reading on the relative strength index (RSI).  3-day chart  Bitcoin's repeated defense of $7,850 – the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from December 2018 low to June 2019 high – indicates seller exhaustion.  A similar message is being sent by the MACD histogram's higher lows below the zero line.  Daily chart  Bitcoin is closing on the 21-day exponential moving average (EMA), which proved a tough nut to crack on Sunday and Monday. The level previously capped upside on Oct. 9 and Oct. 10. Further, the cryptocurrency's inability to hold above that average on Oct. 11 was followed by a drop to $7,800.  This time roun, the stiff resistance, currently at $8,318, looks likely be breached, with the hourly chart reporting a bullish setup amid signs of seller exhaustion on the three-day chart.  All-in-all, BTC looks set to challenge the bearish lower high of $8,820. A UTC close above that level is needed to confirm a bearish-to-bullish trend change, as discussed yesterday.

42382897,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tHM3,1571740221,Casa Is Helping Bitcoin Investors Pass on Their Holdings When They Die,"If you passed away tomorrow, would your loved ones be able to access your bitcoin holdings?  That's a concern addressed by a new service from crypto custody provider Casa that helps holders of the cryptocurrency ensure their assets are passed on after their death.  Called Casa Covenant, the service combines multisignature authorization with a security protocol to assign bitcoin holdings for later inheritance.  With the launch, Casa aims to tackle the quandary for bitcoin users who may pass away while holding bitcoin. Casa said their choices are currently: do nothing and potentially leave the bitcoin inaccessible forever; share account details with a trusted individual, but risk theft; or use a third-party custodian who may not have a process for inheritance and may also pose a security risk.  Casa's ""first-of-a-kind"" service provides a fourth option, according to a blog post on Monday. It allows users to securely pass on their bitcoin to designated heirs after death, while ""minimizing the risk"" that the funds can be stolen in the time before.  Users will need a Keymaster account with the firm and are recommended to work with an estate lawyer to ensure the correct process is carried out after they pass. The lawyer would ""protect a single client key in your multisig setup in the form of a hardware wallet,"" Casa said.  The company will work with the lawyer to educate them on the management of private keys and provide tools to assist that process. It will also help with setting up the Covenant account and with technical aspects of the service, according to the post.  On the tech side, the service adds an optional sixth multisig key to users’ 3-of-5 Key Shield, resulting in a 3-of-6 setup – that is, it would require a transaction to be signed by three of the six key holders to be valid.  The extra key will be activated during the process of setting up the Covenant service and would be held by the client’s estate lawyer, said Casa. If the client should pass away, the estate lawyer key, the Casa recovery key and the safety deposit box key would be used to recover the funds.

42382904,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tHUr,1571738445,Flaws in LocalBitcoins Data Call Into Question Regional Adoption Claims,"When bitcoin advocates claim adoption is surging in developing countries, particularly during periods of political unrest or economic turmoil, their go-to source for evidence is often LocalBitcoins.  The peer-to-peer exchange, which matches buyers and sellers of the largest cryptocurrency in nearly 250 countries, publishes weekly volume data for each nation and region where it has users. This constant stream of fresh data makes LocalBitcoins a unique window into the global market.  But a closer look at the way this data is collected shows substantial noise mixed in with the signals, undermining the claims of growing crypto use empowering the downtrodden.  For example, in Hong Kong, LocalBitcoins data seemed to show increasing volumes, with media reports since August arguing that the protests were boosting crypto adoption. Yet one member of the city’s longstanding bitcoin community, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told CoinDesk there hasn’t been any increase in bitcoin awareness among protesters, nor a noticeable change in activity among regular local users.  Researcher Matt Ahlborg reported that the volume spike in Hong Kong was actually caused by a single trader making roughly 30 transactions to quietly move a significant, albeit undisclosed, amount of bitcoin. (The platform lists both public and private offerings, the latter visible only to buyers preapproved by the seller.)  Elsewhere, conversations with bitcoin veterans in Iran and Egypt indicated LocalBitcoins volume data appeared to have little correlation to local trading activity.  In Iran, sources say, it’s common for traders to mislabel their offers as coming from another country to avoid having the trades canceled by LocalBitcoins.  In Egypt, Cairo-based entrepreneur Mohamed Abdou told CoinDesk:  ""I don’t believe in these statistics as it never reflects the real volume ... Egypt is still in the gray area of crypto regulations, and it is not allowed publicly. This is why there's no clear data or statistics about it.""  LocalBitcoins spokeswoman Veruscka Xavier Filgueira told CoinDesk that some trading activity, especially for smaller amounts, can be and probably is miscategorized in regional data.  Plus, she said, “it is possible that some volume variation is driven by a particular high volume trade or an exceptionally active period for a group of traders.”  For Hong Kong in particular, she said user acquisition has remained stable, at around 1,100 new registrations per 90 days, regardless of the protests.  Out of more than  4 million registered accounts worldwide, Filgueira said the platform had 542,852 active users in September 2019. Meanwhile, traction dipped dramatically in October, due in part to a renewed focus on enforcing know-your-customer (KYC) policies.  According to Ahlborg’s data analytics website, LocalBitcoins’ overall volume in Latin America dipped 6 percent from roughly $9 million the week of Sept. 29 to $8.5 million by Oct. 20. Overall, the region saw $32 million less volume over the past 90 days, compared to the previous 90-day period.  The good, the bad and the ugly  Traders in Venezuela told CoinDesk they believe some of the LocalBitcoins volume there comes from government officials looking to get richer, complicating bitcoin’s image as the great leveler.  Such is the opinion of John Villar, a programmer and entrepreneur who uses the platform regularly to exchange bitcoins and pay his employees in bolivares.  “Mining can only give you a certain amount, but to print bolivares non-stop and then buy bitcoins can give you much more,” he said, explaining how government officials afford bitcoin stashes.  Although LocalBitcoins has KYC data for its traders, spokeswoman Filgueira would not say whether government officials in the repressive regimes where usage is highest are, themselves, using the platform.  However, Ahlborg said that, since the average Venezeula trade is worth roughly $30, there’s strong evidence to suggest a high ratio of middle-class civilian users, even if there are anomalies related to politicians and whales.  Venezuelan expat and activist David Fernando Lopez agreed with this assessment.  “Government officials use gold as a way to funnel money in and out of the country, and lately, they’ve been talking about bitcoin,” Lopez said. “But I don’t think they’re using LocalBitcoins, that’s more for regular people.”  Part of the October drop-off in volumes may also be related to users switching back to dollars as they become more accessible. Ahlborg said few Venezuelans prefer to store their value in bitcoin when dollars are available.  All things considered, and based on the anecdotal evidence, regional volume data from exchanges doesn’t inherently correlate to growing usage or popularity on the ground. Often times, they may reflect a visiting whale or single party moving assets offshore during an isolated deal.  Filgueira said high-volume traders must offer proof of local residence, but that regional data is still far from perfect. More research is needed to better understand bitcoin usage in emerging markets.  Speaking to the broader shift from techie hobbyists to users in restrictive political climates, Filgueira concluded:  “LocalBitcoins' largest volumes in 2014 were concentrated in countries like the UK and in the USA and now we have Venezuela, Russia and Nigeria in the list of countries with the highest trade volumes, which doesn't only reflect the change in the profile of our user base but might also indicate a step forward in the usage of BTC as an alternative financial system.”  Diana Aguilar contributed reporting.

42382907,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tHYd,1571734828,Fiat-to-Crypto 'Carry Trade' May Tempt Traders Tired of Negative Interest Rates,"With the era of negative interest rates well and truly here, return-hungry investors may increasingly borrow in low-interest fiat currencies and invest in higher-yielding cryptocurrency accounts.  ""The fiat-BTC carry trade is the next step in bitcoin growth,"" tweeted popular bitcoin quant investor @100trillionUSD on Oct. 10.  A carry trade is a strategy where a trader uses a low-yielding currency to fund a high-yielding investment.  For instance, the yen carry trade was popular in 2004-2008 when the Federal Reserve hiked rates from 1 percent to 5.25 percent and interest rates in Japan were stuck near 0.5 percent.  Investors borrowed in yen to fund dollar-denominated investments. As a result, the yen weakened by 20 percent against the U.S. dollar.  Currently, the carry trade in the FX markets is pretty much dead with almost every advanced nation having interest rates at or below zero.  But that situation bodes well for a new type of carry trade with a crypto twist.  Lucrative lending...  On the lending side, crypto-asset platforms like Binance, Crypto.com, Celsius Network, BlockFi are paying interest rates on cryptocurrency deposits. They fund this with interest earned from credit lines extended to margin traders and hedgers.  The interest rates are subject to fluctuations, either modified by the platform operator or influenced by the supply-demand mechanics of users interacting with the platform.  For instance, the Bitfinex exchange pays an annual interest rate of 0.66 percent interest on bitcoin deposits and provides loans at 0.59 percent, according to CoinMarketCap's new Interest tracker.  In a sense, Bitfinex is operating as a commercial bank by charging a higher rate on loans and paying relatively less on deposits. (Think of the old 3-6-3 rule: ""borrow at 3 percent, lend at 6 percent, hit the golf course at 3"" – except unlike a bank, crypto exchanges never close.)  While Bitfinex is offering 0.66 percent, other platforms are paying significantly higher interest rates on bitcoin deposits, as seen in the chart below.  One possible reason for the disparity is that like a demand deposit at a bank, Bitfinex allows customers to withdraw at any time, whereas other crypto platforms require the money to be locked up for a period for weeks or months. Crypto.com, for instance, is paying 6 percent, but deposits need to be maintained at least for 90 days.  Then again, BlockFi also allows withdrawals any time (it even removed an early withdrawal penalty, allowing one free withdrawal per month) and it is offering an annual interest rate of 6.20 percent.  Meanwhile, crypto lending provider Nexo is offering up to 8 percent yield on deposits of stablecoins DAI, USD Coin (USDC), Paxos Standard (PAX), TrueUSD (TUSD) and Tether (USDT). Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar.  ...and cheap borrowing  The annual interest rates paid by crypto lending platforms are significantly higher than the rates across the advanced world, as seen below.  Central banks in Europe and Japan are running a negative interest rate policy (NIRP), under which financial institutions are required to pay an interest rate for parking excess reserves with the central bank.  The Swiss National Bank, which introduced negative rates in 2015, currently has the lowest rate in the world at -0.75 percent. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) cut rates to -0.1 percent in January 2016 and has been running the negative interest rate policy ever since.  The yield of -0.12 percent seen on the 10-year Japanese government bond is the side effect of BOJ's market-distorting policies.  Also, corporate debt yields have recently hit unprecedented lows. For instance, Toyota Finance Corp will be issuing three-year notes at an unprecedented low yield of 0.0000000091 percent, according to Bloomberg. It means a trader buying 1 billion yen of the bonds would not even make 1 yen on maturity.  The situation is somewhat better for investors in the U.S. and U.K., where the target short-term rates set by the central bank stand at 1.75 percent and 0.75 percent, respectively. The benchmark 10-year government bond yields, however, are significantly lower than the interest rates paid by the likes of Nexo and Celsius Network.  More importantly, central banks running NIRP are unlikely to normalize their policy anytime soon, given the bleak outlook for the global economy. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently slashed its 2019 global growth forecast to 6 percent – the lowest since 2008.  All-in-all, interest rates across the globe are low and could slide further, boosting the allure of high-yielding crypto deposits.  Aside from the interest rate differential, there's another reason borrowing fiat to buy bitcoin could pay off.  In May of next year, the amount of new bitcoin awarded to miners every 10 minutes or so will be cut in half for the third time in the cryptocurrency's history. Historically, reward halvings have boded well for bitcoin's price.  The next halving could reduce the amount of new bitcoin added to the market by $51 million per week at current prices, according to Alistair Milne, chief investment officer of Altana Digital Currency Fund.  As of writing, BTC is trading above $8,200, representing 120 percent gains on a year-to-date basis.  And, if the carry trade becomes popular, all else equal BTC should appreciate sharply against the USD, the way the greenback did against the Japanese Yen.

42382879,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tEBn,1571731246,Telegram Backer Sought Circle Listing Before SEC Halted Token Launch,"A least one crypto exchange, Circle, was asked to list Telegram's tokens before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) halted the launch of the TON blockchain, court filings show.  According to documents submitted to the court by the SEC, the agency obtained a registration form titled ""Circle Asset Listing Form."" According to the form, it was filed to request a listing on Circle's Poloniex crypto exchange and submitted by Sergey Vasin, chief operating officer of Blackmoon, a small crypto exchange that earlier had announced plans to list grams.  In the form, Vasin said he was acting as the chief operating officer of Gram Vault, a crypto custodian that claimed to have brought a large part of investors into the 2018 Telegram token sale and was planning to hold the tokens on those investors' behalf.  Responding to the question of how he was associated with the project, Vasin said that he's ""COO at the largest custody of Gram tokens (75% of the second round, 50% of the first)"" and added that ""Telegram itself doesn't work with the exchanges.""  In the subpoena to Telegram, the SEC requested information regarding the potential trading of grams on Coinbase, Poloniex, Bittrex, Huobi, Binance, Blackmoon Crypto, and Liquid.io — the last two had previously announced they would list grams.  Coinbase has also recently announced plans to offer custody of the tokens.  In the form, Vasin listed the main members of TON's team, including brothers Pavel and Nikolai Durov, and said that ""around 20 core"" developers are working on the TON project, plus some ""external teams,"" including Ton Labs, a startup led by the TON investors that's developing tools for developers and validators of TON.  As TON's value proposition, Vasin cited Telegram's 300 million-member user base and scaling solutions, naming ethereum as one of the project's competitors.  Neither Vasin, nor a representative of Poloniex parent Circle, which announced plans to spin out the exchange a few days ago, responded to requests for comment by press time.  Communications with SEC  The SEC sued Telegram on Oct. 11, demanding it halt the launch of the messaging app's blockchain project, Telegram Open Network (TON), and issuing tokens to investors in the private token sale in February and March of last year.  The SEC cited Telegram's lack of collaboration with the regulator, pointing out that the company refused to comply with the SEC subpoena as an argument to the court for why it should halt the project.  However, the court filings show that Telegram had been in communication with the SEC over the summer and prior to the launch of the mainnet, which had been previously scheduled for the end of October.  In a document titled ""Fourth Supplemental Memorandum to the Staff of The Securities and Exchange Commission"" filed to the court by the company's lawyers and dated July 25, Telegram provided the details of the upcoming token distribution and several updates over the course of the year.  ""During our meeting with the Staff on July 18, 2019, we offered to provide this document summarizing key aspects of the TON Blockchain,"" Telegram wrote, adding that the memorandum followed four others previously sent to the SEC. The dates of those letters were June 26, 2018, Nov. 20, 2018, Feb. 27, 2019 and March 18, 2019.  The company also proposed a step to ensure grams would not be considered securities, offering to amend the functions of the TON Reserve, the project's treasury:  ""Telegram is open to removing the TON Reserve’s Gram-buying function if the Staff believes that its inclusion would cause Grams to be considered securities under Howey.""  In an email to investors following the SEC lawsuit, Telegram said it had been interacting with the agency for more than a year, including the registration of the two offerings under Regulation D in February and March of last year.  In the subpoena to Telegram, the agency requested a broad range of documentation from Telegram, including all communications with investors, exchanges and potential custodians.  The SEC wanted to know the complete list of investors, the current status and the details of the use of the funds Telegram raised in the token sale and how Telegram made sure the investors were planning to actively use grams, rather than hold them as securities.  In response to the SEC, Telegram lawyer Alexander Drylewski argued that providing all the requested information would violate the confidentiality of Telegram's relationships with investors:  ""We're available to meet and confer regarding these requests, which, as you know, implicate significant data privacy issues, among others.""  A court hearing to decide the fate of the project in the U.S. had been previously scheduled for Oct. 24 but was later postponed until Feb. 18-19, 2020.

The bank said on Friday last week that a cross-border proof-of-concept test was successfully completed involving Mitsui & Co, a Japanese general trading company, Indorama Ventures, a Thai company in the intermediate petrochemicals business, and Bangkok Bank, Thailand's third-largest bank.  In the course of the exercise, Bangkok Bank issued a payment guarantee for Indorama Ventures to Mitsui & Co. Based on that guarantee, SMBC would have been able to undertake receivable financing in a real-world setting.  The platform allows for participants to update purchase orders, invoices, logistics information, shipping schedules and port information, while auto-matching leads to highly-efficient data reconciliation, according to the statement.  Currently, the trade financing process remains to be manual and paper-based and is seen as highly inefficient.  Marco Polo  , which utilizes open-source Corda, is a network backed by Dublin-based TradeIX and New York-based R3 LLC. It counts a number of major financial institutions as its members, including Bangkok Bank, Mitsui & Co, SMBC, Bank of America, BNP Paribas, Mastercard, Standard Chartered, among others.  The network recently completed tests for trade finance transactions between Russia and Germany.  Trade finance using blockchain is a busy space, with an estimated 30 consortia seeking to apply the technology to the business. Competitors include Voltron, which also utilizes Corda and counts Bangkok Bank, HSBC and Standard Chartered among its partners, as well as ethereum-based CargoX and eTrade Connect, which uses.
