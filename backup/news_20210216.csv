42405894,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAepLAT,1613514624,Most Finance Chiefs Still Balk at Bitcoin on the Balance Sheet: Survey,"Bitcoin's march onto corporate balance sheets could be hampered by the crypto's legendary volatility, according to a survey by Gartner released Tuesday that found only 5% of business executives intended to invest in bitcoin as a corporate asset this year.    Eighty-four percent of polled executives (representing 77 firms) told Gartner in February they were spooked by ""financial risk due to volatility of bitcoin"" when considering whether to invest in the crypto.  Bitcoin adoption could prove more fruitful in the long term – but not by much. By 2024 or later, 16% of polled executives said they expect their corporations to be investing in the crypto. Just 5% said the same for this year.  Gartner found no difference between large and small organizations, however 50% of respondents from the tech sector could not rule out eventual crypto investments.  The results are in line with a note Monday by Wedbush analysts, who found that while volatile nature around bitcoin would deter most public companies from investing in the next 12 to 18months, that could move “markedly higher” as more regulation and greater acceptance kick in down the road.

42433630,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOztfh,1613513069,Cult Toy Brand Superplastic Launches NFT Collection on Nifty Gateway,"Basketball players, pop singers and now high-end vinyl toys – lots of different groups are trying out nonfungible tokens (NFTs) on Ethereum as a new way to monetize.      Superplastic is a company that makes artistic vinyl toys for the collectibles market. It's debuting two new figures on the Winklevoss-owned Nifty Gateway, from Guggimon and Janky, two artists with strong Instagram followings.      We might be seeing fresh interest from the non-crypto world because of the sector's growth. NonFungible.com released its 2020 report on NFT data for 2020, finding over 220,000 active wallets in the space and counting 31,504 sellers and 74,529 buyers for the year. The data site captured $251 million in NFT trade volume.      Obviously, mainstream appeal should grow the sector further, and aiming to attract celebrities has always been part of Nifty Gateway's strategy. Beyond social media's newly famous, the mainstream stars are starting to get interested as well. Recently, both Lindsay Lohan and Grimes, the pop star and mother of Elon Musk's latest child, have announced token offerings.      It might be tough to compete with analog celebrities for mindshare, but Superplastic has the advantage of a dedicated following of people who like to speculate on aesthetic goods.      Odds are some number of those fans will be persuaded to check out this whole digital art with provable provenance thing. Let's just hope the company has a plan for preparing its followers to understand what gas fees are.      Each artist will auction one NFT each: ""Electric Scream Dream"" by Janky and ""Well, That Was F**king Weird!"" by Guggimon. There will also be six SuperKranky figures designed together by both artists.This isn't the first foray of a toy company into crypto or NFTs. In fact, CryptoKaiju has offered analog toys whose ownership corresponds with an ERC-721 token on Ethereum for a while now. Superplastic has no plans to connect these digital offerings with a real-world toy.",POSITIVE,없음,ETH | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/02/16/cult-toy-brand-superplastic-launches-nft-collection-on-nifty-gateway,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0f063b244172b26449e1179a6750b239765763ed-2000x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42433638,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOztxh,1613511230,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Remains Around $48.5K Amid Flat Trading Activity,"Bitcoin faced choppy markets for most of Tuesday after briefly trading above $50,000 for the first time during early U.S. trading hours. With some remaining bullish, other analysts and traders warned about near-term price correction.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around 48,810.95 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 0.39% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $47,088.84-$50,584.85 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC between its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a sideway signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s trading volumes on the eight leading crypto exchanges tracked by the CoinDesk 20 remained flat on Tuesday, at roughly half of where it was on Monday on Feb. 8. Meanwhile, data from Glassnode shows that bitcoin’s balance on exchanges continues to drop, a bullish sign taken by some analysts.      “We are at all-time-highs territory [and] the market still has to make up its mind"" about next resistance or supporting levels, Alessandro Andreotti, bitcoin over-the-counter broker, told CoinDesk. “My opinion is that new highs [are coming] in the short term.”      This is happening as retail investors are showing growing interest in the derivatives market.      According to Arcane Research, March futures bitcoin contracts on the retail-focused platforms currently have an annualized premium rate averaging 44.16%. That outpaces those on the institution-driven CME, which shows an average of 24.39%.      “There continues to be net inflows into crypto, particularly into futures,” Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of crypto derivatives exchange FTX, told CoinDesk. “[And] people inside crypto continue to be particularly bullish.”      Others, however, warn about near-term price correction, especially if there is a lack of fresh catalysts on top of Tesla’s $1.5 billion bitcoin purchase that was announced last week.      “The market has gone parabolic since breaking through $20,000 and technical studies are warning of the need for a healthy pullback in the days and weeks ahead to allow for severely stretched readings to unwind and normalize,” said Joel Kruger, cryptocurrency strategist at institution-focused crypto exchange LMAX Digital.      “The $50,000 price level is now relatively high for retail investors, and it is not easy for them to chase after,” Simons Chen, executive director of investment and trading at Hong Kong-based crypto lender Babel Finance, told CoinDesk. He added there was little chance retail investors will be able to push bitcoin’s price above the current record high price in the short-term period.      On its Telegram channel, Singapore-based QCP Capital also expressed a tempered view on the short-term price movement, saying that, historically, bitcoin’s price trended lower in March due to seasonality.      “The longer bitcoin stalls here without a fresh catalyst, the more we will be looking for a longer lasting downside into March. As we’ve highlighted before, the March downside seasonality followed by April upside seasonality is the strongest and most consistent seasonal pattern in bitcoin,” QCP Capital wrote. “It's still too early now for us but into [the end of February,] if volumes drop further, we will be looking for some downside protection [at the end of March.]”      One possible spur for the markets, as CoinDesk reported, is that business intelligence firm MicroStrategy is preparing to purchase more bitcoin. As well, Los Angeles-based privately held investment firm Wedbush Securities said that bitcoin could expect more corporate ownership and adoption after Tesla’s bitcoin investment, meaning that the “fresh catalyst” QCP mentioned could still be imminent.    Ether moves little as DeFi sees small drop amid flash loan attacks    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH) was down Tuesday, trading around $1,754.31 and down 4.07% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Ether’s price has mostly stuck below $1,800 on Tuesday. This has led ether futures traders to close their positions, as what gains they’re able to eke out were eaten by the funding cost they pay for their contract, according to Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5.      “People are now in the habit of expecting prices to climb as if it's a foregone conclusion,” Shah said. At the same time, the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, which is mostly based on the Ethereum blockchain, continues to grow. However, one wrinkle occurred over the past weekend when a flash loan exploit on Cream Finance and Alpha Finance caused a loss of funds totaling $37.6 million and resulting in a slight decline of the total value locked in DeFi.

42433633,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOztZh,1613507843,Bitcoin se recupera de su caída y alcanza los $50K,"Bitcoin alcanzó un nuevo valor máximo al superar los $50.000 esta mañana, después de haber desplazado el exceso de apalancamiento alcista en el mercado de derivados con una rápida caída del precio el lunes.      Por un breve momento, y durante las primeras horas de trading en Nueva York, bitcoin superó por primera vez los $50.000.      El lunes, los valores de bitcoin habían caído $3.000 hasta situarse por debajo de $45.926 durante las primeras horas de trading en Asia, lo que provocó liquidaciones de posiciones largas por aproximadamente $392 millones en el mercado de derivados.      Tras una breve caída, bitcoin superó los $50.000 pero no logró mantener ese valor. Ahora, necesitará la ayuda de los compradores en efectivo o al contado para ubicarse por encima de esa marca, de acuerdo a Patrick Heusser, jefe de operaciones de Crypto Finance AG, con sede en Suiza.      ""Todas aquellas personas que trabajan con derivados han hecho su labor, y parecen agotadas"", dijo Heusser a CoinDesk, y añadió que los valores de bitcoin podrían consolidarse entre $44.000 y $50.000 si no intervienen los compradores al contado.      La reciente subida de bitcoin desde los $40.000 ha sido principalmente impulsada por el apalancamiento de los derivados, a medida que se enfriaron los volúmenes del mercado al contado en los exchanges institucionales, como Coinbase Pro, tal cual fue analizado el lunes por este medio.      En especial, el indicador de la prima de Coinbase, que mide el margen entre el par BTC/USD de Coinbase Pro y el par BTC/USDT de Binance, sigue reportando valores negativos, como este martes señaló Ki Young Ju, director general de la firma de análisis de blockchain CryptoQuant. La prima negativa indica una débil afluencia institucional.      Por el lado minorista, el mercado de derivados ha estado en alza. Los futuros de marzo de bitcoin, en particular, tienen una tasa de prima anualizada que promedia el 44,16% en este momento. Esto supera a la de la Bolsa Mercantil de Chicago, impulsada por instituciones, cuya media es del 24,39%, según el boletín de Arcane Research del 16 de febrero. Unas primas más altas indican una mayor demanda en una plataforma determinada.      ""Los operadores minoristas quieren esa exposición al alza y están fijando el precio de los futuros que vencen en marzo con una prima de casi 5% respecto al precio al contado"", detalló el boletín.

42433637,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOztrh,1613501477,Taking Stock of How Far Crypto Has Come,"Eleven years post-Bitcoin, six years post-launch of Ethereum, eight days after that announcement, the first signs of crypto product-market fit are before us.      Michael Seibel (the co-founder at Twitch and president of Y Combinator) likes to say that product-market fit isn’t some kind of wishy-washy metric. “You have reached product/market fit when you are overwhelmed with usage –usually to the point where... you are swamped just keeping it up and running.” It’s when you have so much demand you can’t keep up with it.    Dermot O'Riordan is a Partner at Eden Block, a European VC firm investing in blockchain infrastructure and emerging crypto-networks.    In Ethereum, we see that with the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and how much people pay for block space.      Almost $60 for a deposit on Compound! Scaling Ethereum is a painful problem, but it’s a good problem to have.      I think it’s fair to say the crypto ecosystem has moved from concept – as per 2016 to 2018, when the space was mostly about white papers and marketing – to adoption. There’s real code. There’s serious capital at stake. And now there are serious cash flows, too.      Taking a systems-level approach to understanding the crypto ecosystem, let’s take stock of some of its key stocks (not stonks): namely, financial capital, technological capital, human capital, and one more that I will come to.    Stocktake #1: Financial Capital    Yes, we’re in a bull market. But, first, some perspective on the importance of bubbles.      “What is perhaps the crucial role of the financial bubble is to facilitate the unavoidable over-investment in the new infrastructures,” says Carlota Perez, author of the influential book “Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital: The Dynamics of Bubbles and Golden Ages.”      “The nature of these networks is such that they cannot provide enough service to be profitable unless they reach enough coverage for widespread usage. The bubble provides the necessary asset inflation for investors to expect capital gains, even if there are no profits or dividends yet.”      Perez argues that we shouldn’t be ashamed of greed and speculation. Bubbles like Railway Mania in the 1840s, the dot-com bubble in the late-1990s and the current crypto bubble were essential revolutions.      See also: Carlota Perez on Blockchains and Technological Revolutions      Yes, all of us mighty apes might be serving a more noble cause after all.      Using Perez’s framework, new technology has two distinct stages: installation and deployment.      The current technological wave of computers, which started in the 1970s, is at the tail end of its deployment period. Or in the words of Ben Thompson of Stratechery.com, it is at “The End of the Beginning.”      Crypto marks the beginning of a new technological paradigm, and it looks like it’s financial bubble time.      From a VC perspective, we see some sky-high valuations and this usually leads to bad outcomes for investors and LPs who show little discretion. And poor hygiene for builders of new crypto protocols and companies facing little scrutiny or oversight. At the same time, it’s never been a better time to be in this space for thoughtful builders and investors.    Crypto financial capital in numbers  Over $23 billion in global venture funding into the broader blockchain space in the last five years alone.  A market capitalization of crypto networks of over $1.3 trillion, with over $200 billion in trading volume over the last 24 hours.    Just look at a log scale of the respective market caps for BTC, ETH, and USDT, the dollar-pegged stablecoin, since inception. Is this what exponential growth looks like?      There’s over $300 billion of yield-producing crypto assets, a figure which will increase significantly once ETH moves over to proof-of-stake as well.      It’s also important to mention what’s happened in DeFi over the last 12 months. Only 12 months ago, DeFi networks as a whole had about $800 million locked up on the supply sides of all of these networks. This number is over $37 billion as of today.    The longer the Bitcoin blockchain keeps our digital gold secure, the longer we can believe it should continue in that vein.    Only one more measure of flow, for now, comparing the transaction volume on Ethereum to other financial networks: in 2020, the total transaction volume on Visa was roughly $8 trillion per year. As of today, the 30 days moving average for value transferred on Ethereum (after adjustments to remove some noise) is more than $8.5 billion per day, which is around $3.1 trillion on an annualized basis.      In other words, Ethereum, the dinosaur of smart contract chains, today processes almost 40% of the value of the Visa network.      And we’re just getting started. Transaction growth is sky-rocketing, notwithstanding the shockingly high gas costs.    Stocktake #2: Technological capital    There’s a Lindy effect in place for Bitcoin (and for Ethereum, too, to some extent) whereby every additional period of survival implies a longer remaining life expectancy. The longer the Bitcoin blockchain keeps our digital gold secure, the longer we can believe it should continue in that vein.      I’ll leave Nic Carter to do his thing and provide the data on how healthy the Bitcoin ecosystem is. TLDR: It was looking very rosy well before the price rises of the last two months.      As for Ethereum’s technological capital, the Beacon Chain has launched. The roadmap to ETH 2.0, or at least ETH 1.5 is becoming more apparent. And with more than 92,000 validators staking 32 ETH each, over $5 billion is locked into the beacon genesis chain, showing serious skin in the game. Notwithstanding, the competitive pressures from Polkadot, Near, Avalanche, Solana and the many other application-specific chains in the Cosmos ecosystem, this level of participation is a huge moat for Ethereum. And it feels like it’s all Ethereum’s to lose, at least in terms of its place as the home of DeFi and open financial markets.      See also: Ethereum 2.0 Explained in 4 Easy Metrics      There’s another more esoteric metric which I like to look at when thinking about the health of Ethereum’s technological capital – the 90-day moving average for internal contract calls – the measure for the interconnected nature of Ethereum’s smart contracts. In other words, how frequently Ethereum smart contracts interact with other Ethereum smart contracts.      This metric shows you how ETH’s native building blocks interact with each other and form more complex higher-order applications. The rate (in blue on the graph above) is growing exponentially. If you want to search for the locus of Ethereum’s network effects, look no further.    Stocktake #3: Human capital    On a human capital side, it’s important to look at this from a developer’s perspective. Developers contribute to the ecosystem’s open source code and enable it to be brought to life.      Fully 80% of all active developers in crypto today, arrived in the last two years, which shows that the hype cycle does bring in actual talent, not just capital.      In terms of raw numbers:    In the Bitcoin ecosystem, there are 70% more developers than three years ago.  In Ethereum there are over 300 new developers contributing code per month  There are 70% more DeFi developers today (this figure is likely already wildly out of date) compared to this time last year.    Blockchain ecosystems are getting broader and more diverse. Of course, there is Bitcoin and Ethereum and DeFi, but there are also emerging ecosystems around NFTs, privacy, Web 3, decentralized resource provisioning, and much more.      Sadly, Ethereum’s usage numbers are not so healthy. There are only 500,000 daily active addresses on Ethereum, out of about 130 million unique addresses.      Despite the rise of DeFi and everything that’s happened in the last 12 months, the number of daily active addresses really hasn’t changed that much.    Stocktake #4: What’s missing?    The real question to ask is, what’s next? Are we at a tipping point? Should we keep calm and carry on, or is the answer to more adoption a technical matter? Are we just waiting for scaling to be solved and for gas costs to be reduced? Why then don’t we see more throughput on any of the Ethereum killers?      Crypto has a narrative problem.      People’s narratives when they hear Bitcoin, Ethereum, blockchain or crypto are simply nightmare stories of financial bogeymen, crooks, and digital robber barons.      We’d like people to think about the importance of credibly neutral systems; the quality and integrity of the many great people in the space; the spirit of generosity and collaboration; how democratic and empowering this technology is, and a future utopia enabled by transparency, resilience, decentralization, and so much more.      See also: Alex Treece - The Intangible Reasons Ethereum and Bitcoin Lead      What people actually think about is the recent Guardian podcast that frames Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency industry as a scam. They think of actual scams too, the many hacks, the $280 million of BTC stuck in a dump in South Wales. They think of speculation and greed.      These narratives create barriers and massive friction for those who want to push the space forward. Unless we solve the narrative problem, efforts to attract an order of magnitude more users, builders, and capital into the space will start to hit a glass ceiling. Nevermind progressive regulation.      One of the strongest criticisms about the mismatch between crypto expectations and reality is that such a theoretically empowering and democratic technology is incredibly elitist and undemocratic through how it leverages opaque and complex language to create an insider class.    What’s the answer to all this?    First of all, we need to make it easier for people to opt into the new crypto paradigm and out of the status quo.      This starts with how clearly we express and live our values.      Social capital is the shared values that allow individuals to work together in a group to achieve a common purpose.      Developing our stock of social capital is essential as part of the next wave of crypto adoption.      Of course, you may have read Satoshi’s white paper, ""Fat Protocols"", ""Why Decentralization Matters,"" the full crypto canon. Yet, how robust do you think crypto’s shared values really are?            For example, the values of a crypto network include decisions around how information is disseminated and what is and isn’t shared to a network’s community (transparency), how team and foundation tokens are vested and sold (alignment), how conflicts are managed (integrity), how work is prioritized (progress), how new code gets accepted and who can contribute (community), how funds are allocated (sustainability), and so on.      We have product-market fit. Now, let’s scale.      To get to mainstream adoption, we must break through crypto’s not so invisible asymptote, the ceiling created by bad narratives that crypto’s growth curve will continue to bump its head against, if we continue down our current path.      Working together to build up crypto’s stock of social capital will create better alignment between all stakeholders, in turn, inspiring new and more positive narratives to attract the next wave of builders and users into the crypto ecosystem.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING,Dermot O'Riordan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/02/16/taking-stock-of-how-far-crypto-has-come,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ee0f1d8a26267fc7073b04ff86d313008a4cd888-1420x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433628,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOztVh,1613500125,Bitcoin Mining Farms in Texas Offline From Winter Storm,"Bitcoin mining farms in Texas have gone offline because of a massive winter storm that drained the state’s power grid.      While some mining farms have stopped operations due to power outages, others are selling electricity back to the grid at a premium, said Ethan Vera, co-founder of Luxor Tech, which is a U.S.-based crypto mining company. Most mining farms are offline, Vera said.      Due to the Texas outage, hashrate generated from Luxor’s mining pool has decreased by 40%. The majority of hashrate for the entire mining pool comes from the U.S. mining farms, Vera said.      While it is not clear what exact percentage of hashrate in the global mining pool is from Texas-based facilities, some of the largest bitcoin mining companies, such as Bitmain and Layer 1, have operations in Texas because of the state’s cheap electricity.      Crypto mining giant Bitmain built one of the world’s largest bitcoin mines in Rockdale, East Texas, in 2019. Peter Thiel-backed crypto mining company Layer1 Technologies started operating its bitcoin factories in West Texas in early 2020. Publicly traded bitcoin mining company Argo Blockchain (ARB) announced last week it intended to acquire land to build mining facilities in West Texas.      Some mining farms are taking advantage of the situation by selling local residents their unused electricity.      “Some bitcoin miners were able to capitalize on selling their unused energy back to the grid for a huge profit,” JP Baric, CEO of Texas-based crypto mining company MiningStore, said on Sunday.      Texas’ power grid has already lost a small portion of energy production over the last weekend because wind turbines were frozen and natural gas available to electric plants became scarce, according to Dan Woodfin, senior director of The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT).      By Sunday all types of energy sources, including nuclear plants, coal plants and thermal generators, were falling off the grid due to the winter storm, Woodfin said, according to a report in the Austin American Statesman.      According to TechCrunch, about 30 gigawatts worth of energy is offline, with 26 gigawatts of that from thermal energy and the remainder coming from wind sources.

42433629,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOztdh,1613498363,Here Comes the Virtual Real Estate Boom,"I have spent my entire professional career devising novel ways to invest in real estate, and recently I have been spending a lot of time in Decentraland. For many years, my colleague TJ Kawamura has been pushing me to look into blockchain-based digital real estate, but it wasn’t until recently that it all clicked for me. Digital real estate has become a legitimate asset class, one worthy of investor consideration and one I believe is likely to appreciate exponentially over the near term.      Not only is digital real estate capable of delivering outsized returns due to its alignment with the rapidly growing crypto-investment universe, but it also appears likely to become a viable store of wealth, almost like real-world art and real-world real estate. Digital real estate exists inside virtual worlds, each its own “digital nation” with a system of clearly delineated, irrevocable property rights. Buying land today in virtual worlds feels a lot like buying land in Manhattan back in 1750. It is also insulated from the COVID-induced volatility of the real-world real estate industry.    Janine Yorio is head of real estate at Republic, an online investment platform for individual investors that’s launching a series of digital real estate funds called Republic Realm. She was previously head of real estate development at Standard Hotels and worked as a portfolio manager for NorthStar Capital.    In virtual worlds, players interact with the world, or “metaverse,” while inhabiting an avatar’s body. They can chat with other users, earn cryptocurrency by playing games and gambling, buy art in galleries, attend concerts and events, and do lots of other things. There are other crypto-based virtual worlds, including Somnium Space, Cryptovoxels, Axie Infinity and The Sandbox (which has not yet launched), but Decentraland is the fastest-growing and most developed of all of them. (Editor's Note: Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk's parent, is invested in Decentraland.)    Why Decentraland?    Decentraland is a multiplayer role-playing game developed by two Argentine software engineers, Estaban Ordano and Ari Meilich. The world centers around a plaza, called Genesis City and, unlike most video games, has no set purpose other than to become a virtual world developed and owned by its users. It shares similarities with early virtual games like SimCity and Second Life, and newer multiplayer games like Minecraft and Fortnite.      What distinguishes Decentraland is that its economy is based upon a cryptocurrency. All of the parcels (called “LAND” in the game) except for roads and plazas can be bought, sold and developed by the users of the game using “MANA,” Decentraland’s own crypto-token. (MANA itself has a market capitalization of about $225 million, a more than fivefold increase since its launch in 2017.)      As of February 2021, MANA prices have increased 321% in the past year.      See also: The People of Decentraland Will Greet You Now      LAND ownership is an NFT recorded on the Ethereum blockchain using the ERC-721 standards (the same as CryptoKitties) which makes it both easily transferable and less prone to fraud. The game’s developers have set a cap of 90,061 on the total number of LAND parcels which will ever be minted. LAND parcels are nonfungible because every parcel has a different set of (x,y) coordinates.      There is also a secondary market where LAND can be bought and sold, and a supporting economy of contractors willing to design and build on these virtual parcels at very real-world prices. Enough people believe that this virtual real estate is scarce and holds value that they are spending meaningful amounts of money on it. For this reason, its ownership has become something of a status symbol among early adopters.      Beyond status, ownership represents something greater – a contribution to the fabric of the Decentraland community. Where and how you develop your parcel has an enormous impact on how players in Decentraland will interact with your LAND. They become spaces where people can engage, explore, build, and socialize, mimicking real-life social interactions while also driving up the LAND’s value.      This has led to a multiyear history of price appreciation in Decentraland real estate. In 2017, the year Decentraland launched, LAND parcels sold for about USD $100 per parcel. In 2019, a portion of the “Genesis Plaza” estate called Estate 331 sold for about $80,000, becoming the second-most expensive nonfungible token (NFT) of the year. Last month, the price of an undeveloped parcel of land had increased to roughly 8,000 MANA (approximately USD$1,400), a 14-fold increase in just three years. Since the game’s launch, there have been more than 50,000 secondary LAND sales totaling $30+ million at an average price of $560, so these data points are not outliers. Today, the total value of all the LAND is about $100 million – and growing.      Investing in digital real estate captures all the positive aspects of derivative trades (asymmetric reward-risk) without the bad (recourse margin/debt), and is also an uncorrelated asset class that offsets market volatility. Although it was previously believed that cryptocurrencies (especially BTC) were like digital gold, backtesting has shown that crypto assets behave differently from gold, equities or bonds. Hence, it's an extremely useful portfolio diversification tool.      There are many reasons I believe digital estate may continue to appreciate.      The best-performing asset of the last decade was not Amazon or Apple stock; it wasbitcoin, an asset that trades completely outside the traditional banking system.Crypto – once regarded as a folly reserved for gamers and coders – has become so mainstream that anyone with a smartphone can buy and sell it, and large financial institutions are finally following suit.    The rise of NFTs    Investment in virtual real estate occurs through the purchase and exchange of nonfungible tokens (or NFTs), a special type of cryptographic token which represents something unique; non-fungible tokens are thus not mutually interchangeable. This is in contrast to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin that are fungible in nature. Each NFT is distinct, it is indivisible and it is not interchangeable.      Although not as liquid as some cryptocurrencies that trade on larger exchanges, virtual real estate NFTs are exchangeable on NFT marketplaces through transactions that are much more streamlined and transparent than real-world real estate transactions.      Instead of a traditional deed or title which is cumbersome to transfer, ownership of virtual real estate is recorded on a decentralized ledger through an NFT. Holders are the perpetual owners of their digital items, even if Decentraland shuts down or is abandoned by the developers.      See also: Leah Callon-Butler - The NFT Game That Makes Cents for Filipinos During COVID      Evidence of adoption and acceptance of NFTs as a proxy for ownership can be best demonstrated by the depth of the market and the enormity of some of the recent transactions, including a $1.5 million sale of property in the metaverse Axie Infinity this month.      The quest for resilient assets will continue in this environment of low interest rates and high inflation, making crypto-assets seem less risky than some real world asset types.      I’m concerned about the real-world real estate industry. Retail, office and hospitality rents and occupancy have plummeted, and their future outlook remains bleak. Single-family homes and apartments seem impervious to the pandemic, but how much more can their values rise while still remaining somewhat affordable against the backdrop of stagnant wages? Real estate remains one of the planet’s greatest stores of wealth and hedges against inflation, but even the most unflappable real estate advocates are questioning how to value real estate today.      It’s still early days for virtual worlds.      Early versions of Decentraland were clunky, but the game has improved a lot since its launch, and players have noticed. LAND owners have invested considerable time and money building elaborate architectural structures, games and wearables for the game. The game’s developers continually release new features; they operate with unparalleled transparency, giving the community a full look into what features, rollouts, and improvements to expect for Decentraland’s future on a publicly viewable Trello board.      The discussion boards in-game and on Discord and Reddit are very active. The secondary market for in-game purchases like land and wearables show signs of increasing liquidity and meaningful volume. Every time I revisit Decentraland, I see more users and more interactivity. At the same time, in-game asset prices are trending upwards.      That being said, today Decentraland still feels sparsely populated and most LAND remains undeveloped. Some of this feeling of sparseness is because the game was built to accommodate a large user base which has not yet materialized, and so it is played across multiple servers. This system was borrowed from the likes of Minecraft and Fortnite where hundreds of thousands of people play at any given time and so play occurs across multiple “servers” to avoid feeling overcrowded. As a result, a player may only encounter a handful of other players in Decentraland on a typical visit.      To some, this reality might seem disconcerting. (Where are all the people?) To me, it feels like a tremendous opportunity to get in early, at the beginning of a new utopia for self-proclaimed misfits. The total addressable market for such a paradise? Nearly infinite and entirely defined by the creativity of humankind.    Virtual socialization is inevitable    Virtual worlds are not new. Both Second Life and Eve Online, virtual worlds designed for adults, launched in 2003 and attracted millions of users at their peak. Players built complex economies within those games. But, both games rose to popularity when the real world was still very much rooted in real-life interaction, and have since declined in popularity while the new crypto-based upstarts have been growing. Those games were just a bit too early.      Since then, human interaction and socialization has become overwhelmingly virtual; most people have moved their social and business relationships to their phone or laptop. If ever there was a tipping point when people would choose en masse to socialize on computers rather than in person, it is now, during a global pandemic that has driven us all online. These new habits will become permanent behavioral and cultural shifts, irrevocably changing what we consider normal and acceptable.      See also: Virtual Property Sells for $1.5M in Ether, Smashing NFT Record      There are many examples of this shift toward less real-life interaction, including the rise of Clubhouse, one of the fastest-growing startups of 2020, which is a cross between podcasts and a 1980s party line. It is an entirely virtual – and audio – social experience that is growing like wildfire.      When we invest, especially in real estate, we must attempt to predict the future – a future 10 or more years down the road. In 10 years, today’s children will be young adults and their preferences will dictate what becomes mainstream and normative.      Both of my own children are completely addicted to video games set in virtual worlds – specifically Minecraft, the best-selling video game of all time. (For example, if I ask my children if they would rather play with their friends or play Minecraft, they will always, without fail, choose the latter.) Their Minecraft addiction – and that of millions of other school-age children – has been fueled by nearly a year of online schooling that has resulted in excessive amounts of screen time and access to video games.      Minecraft and similar games are shaping how children interact with technology and with each other. Decentraland and the other adult crypto-based virtual worlds are designed to attract players who have aged out of the children’s games, for the teenagers and young adults who seek deeper human connections based more upon socializing and transacting than on treasure hunt and enemy slaughter. The user experience (UX) of the adult games uses the same conventions as the children’s versions.    Virtual real estate: new players, new rules    In 2004, Ailin Graef, better known by her avatar’s name Anshe Chung, began amassing virtual real estate in Second Life. She started with less than $10, and became famous for becoming the first avatar to achieve a net worth of more than USD $1 million from business dealings conducted entirely inside a virtual world. Much of today’s excitement about virtual real estate and NFT speculation can be traced back to the mythology surrounding Anshe Chung.      The key to speculating on land in the virtual world is to learn the new rules. The old rules, the ones that favor the already-rich, no longer hold true. The old real estate adage “location, location, location” implies that values are set by their proximity and visibility, but in virtual worlds, players can teleport to new locations using cartesian coordinates, so visibility and foot traffic matter much less.      What matters in the virtual world is bringing humanity and life to something flat and pixelated, drawing players somewhere, and then encouraging them to return and interact. (These settlements are often called “clusters of content.”) In the virtual world, ingenuity and design matter far more than location and budget.      Decentraland’s developers have taken a very thoughtful and light-handed approach to building the game’s foundational layers. New projects and partnerships are already underway to make this virtual world a sophisticated and engaging alternate reality – one that will likely become as ubiquitous and addictive as Facebook and Instagram are today.      The winners in Decentraland will not just be one person. And that, right there, is why it will succeed. By leveling the playing field, Decentraland has set itself up to be a winner in the race to build the perfect virtual world – a utopia.      For all these reasons, I’m convinced that digital real estate is an investment opportunity worth considering. While this asset class is still extremely risky and a full loss of principal is a probable outcome, it may make sense for risk-tolerant investors to allocate a small portion of their alternative investment portfolio to this nascent asset class.      What’s more, participants in this virtual economy will learn it is an exhilarating time to participate. The possibility of escaping to a new world and reinventing yourself will always hold an allure, even to the stodgiest among us. When coupled with colorful graphics, art, music and new friends from around the world, it’s easy to understand why Decentraland is becoming more popular.      Early movers in virtual real estate have the ability to get in at prices that are still affordable compared to real-world markets. Like early movers in fast-growing places in the real world (Florida's The Villages; Austin, Texas; Las Vegas), those who invest early and hold for the long term will benefit.",POSITIVE,MANA,AXS | BUSINESS | MANA | MARKET | TRADING,Janine Yorio,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/02/16/here-comes-the-virtual-real-estate-boom,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bb3787cf2671be9dd2a2bb972279caeb407323e6-1600x922.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Per a blog post shared with CoinDesk, Coinbase customers can now sign up to stake their ETH into the Beacon Chain smart contract, the coordinator and bridge between the old Ethereum and Ethereum 2.0, the network’s momentous migration to a proof-of-stake network.      This upgrade will do away with proof-of-work mining in favor of staking. Typically, you need 32 ETH to run a validator node for Ethereum’s new blockchain, but Coinbase will allow their users to stake any amount of ETH in their account.      Rhea Kaw, a senior product manager for Coinbase’s retail team, told CoinDesk that Coinbase users could earn up to 7.5% APR on their staked ETH, depending on the Ethereum network’s variable rate of return.      In exchange for the service, Coinbase “take[s] a commission on all rewards received, and the return rate for our customers reflects this commission,” Kaw said. Per Coinbase’s User Agreement, this staking commission is 25% of the rewards received.      In addition to the forthcoming Ethereum staking option, Coinbase users can also stake Algorand (ALGO), Cosmos (ATOM) and Tezos (XTZ) tokens.      Besides Coinbase, Kraken exchange also stakes ETH on behalf of their customers and is actively depositing ETH into Ethereum 2.0’s Beacon Chain contract. Popular web and software wallet MyEtherWallet supports in-app Eth 2.0 staking as well.    Ethereum 2.0: Ethereum’s big leap    The “Beacon Chain” – the backbone of Ethereum’s new design – went live in December and so did Ethereum 2.0’s deposit contract. To claim a stake in the new network, Ethereans can deposit legacy ETH into this contract to convert it to ETH2 (aka Beacon Chain ETH, or BETH).      Once ether is deposited into the Beacon Chain, it cannot be withdrawn directly – however, using an exchange will be one way of getting around this restriction. Kaw told CoinDesk that “initially, [Coinbase] customers will not be able to sell or send the portion of [ether] that they choose to stake. However, Coinbase is exploring avenues by which to give customers a way to trade their staked ETH very soon.”      “All [ether] will ultimately automatically migrate to ETH2 once the network has been fully updated,” Kaw concluded.

42433643,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOztvh,1613496280,Blockchain Bites: Bitcoin Volatility Hasn't Shaken Out Institutions,"Sound bites    Purpose Investments CEO Som Seif, speaking on CoinDesk TV, said there have been measurable improvements made to the infrastructure supporting the crypto economy. In fact, he thinks it would have been a mistake three years ago if regulators had approved a bitcoin exchange-traded fund when his firm first floated an application.      “So much work has been done in the backend of this, the plumbing, to effectively allow something like this. I think the regulators are comfortable,"" Seif said. Purpose is the first North American firm to release a regulated crypto ETF.    Three stories    1. Volatility hasn’t shaken institutional interest in bitcoin. Bitcoin whipsawed early this week, dropping $3,000 in early Monday trading and setting a new high above $50,000 on Tuesday.    In the options markets, bearish bets are consolidating around the $40,000 mark – meaning traders are not predicting an extended/sustained price drop below that figure.  That said, “long tech” has retaken its spot as the “most-crowded trade” in the financial markets, according to a Bank of America survey, though bitcoin is close behind.    2. Two of bitcoin’s most prominent backers, NYDIG and MicroStrategy, are doubling down on their crypto plays.    NYDIG, Stone Ridge Asset Management’s bitcoin spin-off firm, has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) that would trade on the stock market, like AAPL or TSLA. (The SEC has been hesitant to approve these investible products.)  MicroStrategy is planning to buy as much as $690 million more bitcoin, announcing an additional wave of convertible notes. MicroStrategy’s BTC horde is worth more than $3.5 billion.    3. Ripple is unlikely to settle with the SEC according to the latest filing in the case. Previous settlement discussions that took place under the Trump administration have been disrupted, as the division directors involved have since left the SEC.    In December, the SEC sued Ripple over alleged violations of federal securities laws. It said the company, CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Chairman Chris Larsen sold over $1 billion in XRP to retail investors without registering the cryptocurrency as a security or seeking an exemption.  At stake    Regulatory wheel The slow wheel of regulatory progress could be driving cryptocurrency investors underground. And it’s a global phenomenon.      In one such example, Hong Kong’s security regulator has proposed rules to limit cryptocurrency trading to professional investors and only on approved exchanges. This could drive the retail crowd towards unregulated peer-to-peer platforms, according to industry advocacy group Global Digital Finance (GDF). OKCoin, BitMEX and Coinbase are all GDF members.      “Restricting cryptocurrency trading to professional investors only is different to what we have seen in other jurisdictions such as Singapore, the U.K. and the U.S., where retail investors can buy and sell virtual assets,” said Malcolm Wright, chairman of GDF’s advisory council      A similar argument was put forward by Som Seif, founder and CEO of Purpose Investments, the firm responsible for the first approved bitcoin ETF product in North America.      Speaking on CoinDesk TV, Seif noted that investors are hungry for ways to gain crypto exposure. Reluctance by the SEC to approve a bitcoin ETF could drive interest in alternatives such as investing in MicroStrategy, a company so loaded with bitcoin it almost functions like an exposure to the asset.      “If you don’t regulate something [investors] will find a way to access it in any other way … which opens up much greater investor risk,” Seif said.      That said, the past several years has been a boon for the crypto asset substructure. Seif noted the number and quality of custodians, intermediaries and data providers that have come online, all of which serves to foster confidence among regulators.

42433622,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOztPh,1613495561,"After Breaching $50K, Bitcoin Gives Up Earlier Gains","Bitcoin’s price saw a retracement of its earlier gains on Tuesday, but the market expects that it will soon resume its long-term bullish trend and push fresh new all-time highs.      For a brief moment during early New York trading hours, bitcoin broke above $50,000 for the first time ever. However, at press time bitcoin’s price was trading at $48,249.23, down 0.29% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk’s BPI.      “It’s an impressive milestone for bitcoin [reaching above $50,000] that the crypto community has been waiting for,” Alessandro Andreotti, bitcoin over-the-counter broker, told CoinDesk. “In my opinion we are going to keep reaching fresh new highs soon.”      The pullback after the record high price at $50,584.85 will not be long-lasting, according to Andreotti.      That is a sentiment echoed by analysts and traders, who note that significant amounts of liquidity flowing into the crypto market as a whole has been the underlying driver of the rally over the past few days.      The market opened last week with the news that Elon Musk’s Tesla purchased $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin as part of the company’s balance sheet strategy. Since then, bitcoin’s price has been able to hold onto those gains, despite a small-scale price retreat like the one that happened on Feb. 14.

That outpaces those on the institution-driven Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which averaged at 24.39%, noted Arcane Research’s newsletter dated Feb. 16.

42433631,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOzthh,1613494539,Popular Crypto App Found to Have Ties to Data Tracking Company: Report,"Android versions of popular cryptocurrency app Bitcoin Ticker Widget and a seeming clone of Steemit, Steemit Earn Money, included software development kit (SDK) tools that extract extensive data on users in the past and are potentially linked to location tracking code from X-Mode a notorious data tracking company, according to a new report from Express VPN Digital Security Lab. Two other personal finance apps also have been found to contain these data trackers.      “We wanted to say to consumers: ‘This is a huge problem; you may not be aware of it,’” said Sean O’Brien, principal researcher at ExpressVPN Digital Security Lab. “Even though these apps aren't all huge brands, these apps have been downloaded 1.7 billion times, collectively, and millions of times for each individual app. They're running on people's phones in their pockets. People are using them for dating and social and finances but they're not fully aware of the amount of data that’s being scooped up.”    Scooping personal data    While there are many companies that buy and sell access to location data harvested from unsuspecting people’s phones, X-Mode has come under scrutiny after its ties to government contractors and the military were revealed.      In November 2020, Vice reported X-Mode was getting detailed location data back from multiple Muslim prayer apps, then selling that data “to contractors, and by extension, the military.”      Read more: From SIM-Swaps to Home-Invasion Threats, Ledger Leak Has Cascading Consequences      This new report, a far more extensive inquiry into this issue, found X-Mode code was in 44% of the 450 apps they analyzed, and those apps had been downloaded at least a billion times.      “These apps are global and include health as well as weather apps, games and makeup photo filters,’ reads the report.    “They're running on people's phones in their pockets. People are using them for dating and social and finances but they're not fully aware of the amount of data that’s being scooped up.”    While Steemit Earn Money has only been downloaded about 100 times, Bitcoin Ticker Widget has been downloaded over 1 million times.      In December, Apple and Google told developers to remove X-Mode from their apps or be banned from their app stores, but by the end of January, the report found, many apps have not yet complied, which was confirmed by TechCrunch in at least one case.      Overall, the study examined 450 Android apps for data trackers.    X-Mode’s SDKs and data brokers    SDKs are foundational tools that make it quicker and easier for developers to make apps. That being said, those tools can contain code that isn’t necessary to the core function of an app. This extra code can track location, extract data and generally relay information back to the creator of the SDK. That information can then be shared or sold to be used for a variety of purposes.      When users download an app and accepts its terms of service and privacy policy, they may be inadvertently opting into these forms of data collection, even if they’re not told exactly whose hands the data may end up in. These sorts of practices are common in the world of targeting advertising but, as has been previously documented, data can also end up in the hands of law enforcement (even without a warrant), bounty hunters and others.      Read more: How a Lawsuit Against the IRS Is Trying to Expand Privacy for Crypto Users      “Inside the X-Mode SDK, are code references to five data providers,” said O’Brien. “These are other entities that people loosely called ‘data brokers.’ Sometimes they're doing actual selling of data and sometimes they're not. While it’s somewhat complex, these five entities are basically well-known brands in this location surveillance space.”      “What seems to be occurring because of what's in the code is that these data providers have some sort of business relationship with X-mode, either current or prior,” said O’Brien. “And if they are enabled in these apps, then those providers are also getting some information from the app that has the X-mode SDK.”    OneAudience, Opensignal and location data tracking    OneAudience, included in both Bitcoin Ticker Widget and Steemit Earn Money, was one “data broker” tracker referenced in X-Mode’s code as part of the SDK. It was the subject of a ban and lawsuit by Facebook over data privacy violations because of data OneAudience’s SDK was collecting.      In February 2020 Twitter and Facebook claimed that “OneAudience had been harvesting private data, such as people’s names, genders, emails, usernames and potentially people’s last tweets” to such an extent that it has been compared to the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The SDK was shut down at the end of 2019.      Another data tracker, Opensignal, primarily functions as a WiFi mapper, through which users’ locations can be determined.      In its lawsuit against OneAudience, according to Recode, Facebook argued that “OneAudience also paid apps to harvest users’ Google and Twitter information when they logged into one of the compromised apps using their Google or Twitter account information.”      Read more: This Elusive Malware Has Been Targeting Crypto Wallets for a Year      OneAudience, when shutting down the SDK that was the subject of the lawsuit, said, “We were advised that personal information from hundreds of mobile IDs may have been passed to our OneAudience platform. This data was never intended to be collected, never added to our database and never used.”      Opensignal’s business model, on the other hand, is primarily dependent upon its Wi-Fi mapping use case.      “‘The question is, how much of the Wi-Fi data are they scooping?”’ asked O’Brien.      In its privacy policy, Opensignal states it gathers geolocation data, “network type, network operator, cellular and WiFi signal strength and quality, and the identifiers of connected cell towers and WiFi routers.”      OneAudience did not respond to a request for comment. Opensignal, in response to a request for comment, directed readers to its Data Privacy Charter.    A 'rich amount' of personal data    Stepping back and looking at the report and network traffic from these apps, O’Brien has two big takeaways when it comes to the impact on your data privacy.      “Usually the data is not being handled very well,” he said. “And there's a rich amount of data that can be used as an identifier for a person that's going through the pipe, even if location is the only named reason the data is being scooped up.”      If you choose to keep using the apps like Bitcoin Ticker Widget and Steemit Earn Money, there are ways to limit their data-tracking capabilities. O’Brien said users should go into settings and check permissions for the app, especially location permissions, and revoke them.      “That may mean the app becomes less functional or displays nagging screens asking for permission,” he said. “Otherwise, unfortunately, the only other step is removing the app. If you’re a California or [European Union] resident, there may be some other steps to take regarding requesting information to be deleted or at least requesting a copy of the information they have.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/16/popular-crypto-app-found-to-have-ties-to-data-tracking-company-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5734ad086b1b35bbe828176741bf7f52e59e79b2-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a note on Monday, Wedbush analysts called Tesla's bitcoin investment a ""game-changer"" for the top cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, adding that it could pave the way for more corporate ownership and adoption, according to Business Insider.      The firm added that payments companies such as PayPal and Square would benefit if Tesla begins accepting payments for its high-end cars in bitcoin and the crypto boom could be ""neutral to slightly positive"" for Visa and Mastercard.      Tesla disclosed its bitcoin stash, then valued at $1.5 billion, last Monday, reviving animal spirits in the cryptocurrency markets and raising hopes for more institutional participation. The Fortune 500 firm also said it might accept bitcoin as means of payment.      However, according to Wedbush, mass corporate adoption may remain elusive in the short-run due to bitcoin's high price volatility. ""Given the still nascent and volatile nature around bitcoin, less than 5% of public companies will likely invest in bitcoin over the next twelve to eighteen months, but that could move ""markedly higher"" as more regulation and acceptance of the cryptocurrency takes hold in the future,"" Wedbush's analysts noted.      Speaking of bitcoin's recent price rally, the firm believes it's more than just a ""fad"" and represents the growth in the digital currency and the blockchain space.      Also read: ‘Long Tech’ Retakes Most-Crowded Trade Crown from Bitcoin: Bank of America Survey      ""We believe the trend of transactions, bitcoin investments, and blockchain-driven initiatives could surge over the coming years as this bitcoin mania is not a fad in our opinion, but rather the start of a new age on the digital currency front,"" said Wedbush.

42421780,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpxgD,1613487631,State of Crypto: Will 2021 Finally Be the Year of the Bitcoin ETF?,"There’s been renewed interest in bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with the nomination of Gary Gensler to head the Securities and Exchange Commission and the approval of a true Canadian bitcoin ETF. Whether one gets approved in the U.S. is still unclear.  You're reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  When ETF?  The narrative  The big news last week was the Ontario Securities Commission approved North America’s first bitcoin ETF in Canada. An ETF, which is essentially a retail-friendly, regulated bitcoin investment vehicle that can trade in popular brokerage apps, has long been a product the industry has wanted. Numerous applications have been rejected in the U.S., but the approval of one in Canada could be an early sign that we’ll soon see something similar in the States.  Why it matters  Basically, the idea is a bitcoin ETF would provide everyday investors with:  Bitcoin exposure through existing retail trading apps, such as TD Ameritrade, BUT:  These traders would not actually need to buy bitcoin.  In short, an ETFwould let people invest in bitcoin without having to set up a wallet or trust in an exchange that might go down when market volatility rises.  There are also those who believe an ETF would help spark or continue a bull run, but considering Elon Musk can pretty much just do that on his own now I’m not so sure an ETF seems as necessary as it did in 2018.  Breaking it down  The crypto market has matured since 2017 and 2018, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was rejecting ETF applications left and right.  Matthew Hougan, the chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management (a firm that’s gone to great lengths to get a bitcoin ETF approved), told CoinDesk that the futures market tied to cryptocurrencies has grown significantly, the underlying spot markets are functioning better and the U.S. regulatory structure has evolved. But is that enough?  The main question is whether the market has matured enough to meet the requirements listed under the Securities Exchange Act, the federal law that oversees securities trading within the U.S.  Ark Investment Management CEO Cathie Wood recently told an audience she thinks the bitcoin market might need to see $2 trillion in demand before the SEC is comfortable with an ETF.  Hougan isn’t so sure, saying he thinks bitcoin’s futures market is comparable to hard wheat in size (hard wheat has both a futures market and ETFs, which is more than you can say for onions).  Gary Gensler  Some of the thinking about whether or not to file a bitcoin ETF application involves the new administration and the nomination of Gary Gensler as SEC chair. Gensler, a longtime crypto advocate who’s perhaps best known for his work on derivatives regulation at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission after the last financial crisis, is expected to be fairly crypto-friendly, at least to the degree of approving an ETF. Still, questions remain.  “It's certainly too early to say what his view will be on crypto, whether it will be a priority, what that will do to influence the market, and I think that may even be a premature conversation,” Hougan said.  At the least, while Gensler may be interested in crypto, it’s not likely to be a priority, given many of the other issues he’ll have to address, including likely having to form a response to the market volatility seen last month with the GameStop stock pump.  The better question is what has changed over the past two years.  According to Hougan, the factors that would support an ETF approval include:  Market efficiency has increased;  Regulatory oversight has evolved;  New custody solutions have entered the market; and  There are better audit processes.  However, the SEC has used various objections in rejecting past ETF applications. The outstanding questions include:  Whether the SEC’s market surveillance questions have been answered; and  Whether the SEC’s market manipulation questions have been answered.  “The market has gotten better and so the question you’re left with is ‘do we know enough’ and ‘has the market gotten better enough’ and we just don’t know,” Hougan said.  Canada  One positive sign for the industry is last week’s approval of an open-ended ETF in Canada. To be clear, it’s not the first fund to trade in Canada: 3iq launched a bitcoin fund last year. However, this is the first ETF that will trade on a retail-accessible exchange – the Toronto Stock Exchange – within North America.  Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, said on Twitter the “U.S. usually follows shortly after” Canadian regulators in approving such products, calling the approval a “good sign” for American applicants.  His guess: Late September is when we’ll see the approval, and it could see $50 billion in inflows over its first year.  Here’s what needs to happen:  A company has to file for an ETF by filing a Form 19b-4. Two companies have filed for an ETF recently: VanEck and Valkyrie. However, neither has filed a 19b-4 form, which would kick off the SEC review process.  Once someone does file the 19b-4 form, however, the SEC has to acknowledge it’s reviewing it. This kicks off a 45-day review period.  The SEC can say it needs more time and/or provide feedback. The agency can extend the review period up to 240 days (240 days from today would be Oct. 14).  The SEC staff would decide whether or not to approve the application, and then the five commissioners would agree (or disagree, as the case may be).  At some point, the SEC would have to approve or reject the application.  If the application is approved, congratulations to the issuer and to the next big thing that everyone will get excited about.  If the application is denied, a Commissioner (or applicant) could request a review of the decision. This happened to nine ETF applications that were rejected simultaneously in 2018. I still have no idea what the resolution was.  Come to think of it, the SEC also reviewed a Bitwise application that was rejected. The company later withdrew that particular application.  So, in short, while there are positive signs for an ETF approval in 2021, nothing is guaranteed.  SEC lawsuits  In other, unrelated news, last week Acting SEC Chair Allison Herren Lee published a statement ending the contingent settlement offers that could lead to the faster resolution of SEC cases. This means that cases could drag on longer for crypto companies that get caught in the SEC crosshairs. (Here’s looking at you: Ripple.)  The statement said the agency’s Division of Enforcement will no longer recommend settlements that are contingent on whether or not a company receives a waiver to act as a Well-Known Seasoned Issuer (WKSI).  These waivers had perks. In the past, they could be used as part of a settlement offer if the SEC was suing a company on securities law violations.  In other words, if the SEC Division of Enforcement is suing a company, say a hypothetical cryptocurrency-related firm, for alleged violations of the law, a settlement could have been contingent on the firm receiving WKSI status. This condition helped companies know what their penalties would be in a settlement, and what they could do post-litigation.  Lee said this leads to a potential conflict between the SEC’s different divisions.  This new policy would appear to lessen the chances of such settlements occuring in future.  Commissioners Hester Peirce and Elad Roisman pushed back against the move in a dissenting statement, writing that the previous policy didn’t lead to any structural conflicts.  Companies may be less willing to pursue settlements if they don’t know whether they’ll receive waivers to continue operating, they wrote, warning that this could lead to more time (and therefore, resources) spent pursuing cases.  It remains to be seen what incoming chair Gary Gensler will do. By the way – I’ll be talking about this case during a virtual panel hosted by the New York Financial Writers’ Association next Tuesday at 7:00 p.m. ET. Come check it out.  Biden's rule  Honestly, not a whole lot has happened in the past week. No new nominations, no confirmation hearings scheduled yet. However, the U.S. Senate’s impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump has wrapped up, which should give the body more time to consider nominations.  Changing of the guard  Elsewhere:  Mastercard Will Let Merchants Accept Payments in Crypto This Year: Payments giant Mastercard will settle transactions in crypto and let merchants accept crypto payments, according to my colleague Danny Nelson. This could be a sign that Mastercard doesn’t anticipate any regulatory issues with this space. Still, the devil is in the details. A blog post published after the article specifies that this will basically only apply to stablecoins, and only stablecoins with built-in consumer protections and regulatory compliance. We’ll check in next January to see if it has happened.

A Bloomberg report says all cryptocurrencies would be banned, but investors would have three to six months to close out their positions, which is kind of surprising? Anyway, this seems to be moving full speed ahead.  Crypto Use in Terrorism ‘a Growing Problem,’ Yellen Says: All I’ll say is there’s a bit of a theme here, and it’s worth your attention. More to come.  Outside crypto:  Tesla Bitcoin Bet Exposes Limits of Crypto Accounting Rules: Okay, so within crypto, but outside CoinDesk. Anyways, it turns out that because taxes are weird, Tesla has to report any potential loss in the value of the $1.5 billion in crypto it bought last month, even if it hasn’t actually sold the bitcoin, should the holdings’ value decline before its next earnings report, according to Bloomberg. However, should the bitcoin’s value increase, Tesla cannot report that. This is because U.S. tax standards-setters (the Financial Accounting Standards Board) haven’t created any specific guidance around digital currencies. Probably wouldn’t hurt if they did, though Bloomberg Tax reports that’s not likely to happen anytime soon.

Announced Tuesday, Unstoppable is tapping Cloudflare's Distributed Web Resolver to link to decentralized websites though .crypto addresses, instead of requiring a browser plug-in.      A .crypto address can now be accessed in the same way a user types .com or .gov into a browser address bar, opening up the benefits of decentralized blockchain sites to more users, according to Unstoppable Domains.      Decentralized domains are controlled solely by the owner, not centralized authorities. This brings the advantages of greater security and privacy, as well as being harder to take down than traditional domains, said the firm.      “In a time when data breaches have become commonplace, while privacy and ownership over an individual’s own digital assets is paramount, centralized control has been called into question by many forward-thinking people and companies,” said Matthew Gould, CEO of Unstoppable Domains. “This new system is different. It puts the control back where it should be, back in the hands of the user.”      The service uses DNS over HTTPS, which is considered more secure and private than traditional DNS.

Fireblocks and First are providing the digital plumbing to allow financial service providers such as banks, exchanges, payment service providers (PSPs) and eWallets to plug into Diem on day one, the companies said.      Facebook unveiled the libra project in 2019 and almost immediately became embroiled in a whirlwind of regulatory blowback and governmental outrage. The project's ambitious goal to create a private global stablecoin backed by a basket of fiat currencies threatened to unseat the high echelons of sovereign monetary policy.      Now, the rebranded diem plans to emerge around the end of this quarter, with a modest minimum viable project based around a U.S. dollar stablecoin.      It will be integrated, via Fireblocks and First, with Diem Association members like Spotify, Farfetch, Lyft, Uber and Shopify. (It’s notable that former Libra Association members PayPal, Mastercard and Visa are busy pursuing their own plans with public cryptocurrencies.)    Read more: Libra Rebrands to ‘Diem’ in Anticipation of 2021 Launch    The streamlined project has bent to the will of regulators and operates on a strict permissioned basis with a specific onboarding process to become a diem virtual asset service provider, or VASP.      “What Fireblocks and First have built allows merchants and payment service providers to use the diem stablecoin as a payment method in a way that's really integrated,” Michael Shaulov, CEO of Fireblocks, said in an interview. “It's more or less seamless, like how they would accept Visa, Mastercard or any other form of payment.”      The diem payments system also allows things like refunds, and the stablecoin can be easily changed back into fiat to pay merchants or salaries and so on, Shaulov said. Looking further down the road, the network also includes a sophisticated smart contract language called Move, Shaulov added, which could be used in areas like permissioned decentralized finance (DeFi.)      Shaulov believes diem will still be one of the fundamental projects bringing crypto into the mainstream, despite taking a while to get off the ground and garnering criticism because of its narrowed-down launch product.      “Think about the impact PayPal is having on bitcoin by bringing it to 350 million users,” Shaulov said. “Facebook has 2.5 billion users.

42433627,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOztbh,1613484045,Osprey Fund’s Bitcoin Trust Is Now Available to Retail Investors via OTC,"Osprey Fund’s bitcoin trust is now available to retail investors via the over-the-counter (OTC) market, the company announced Tuesday.      The fund was formed two years ago, and Osprey applied to register the trust with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the middle of last year, said Osprey CEO Greg King.      It joins a crop of new bitcoin funds aimed squarely at the market-leading Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) before a bitcoin ETF is approved by the SEC. This includes offerings from Bitwise Asset Management, BlockFi and CrossTower that aim to give traditional investors exposure to bitcoin without having to touch the asset itself.      Structured similarly to GBTC, the Osprey fund has nearly $80 million in assets under management (AUM) and can be accessed directly by accredited investors and indirectly by retail investors via OTC trading desks. (Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk’s parent company.)      Osprey boasts a 0.49% management fee compared to GBTC’s 2% annual fee, but the fund also has 0.3% in other expenses from services like crypto custody. King said he doesn’t expect those extra expenses to stick around, however.      “We expect those costs will go down both over time and as AUM grows,” King said. “Custody costs have gone down significantly over the past few years and as those changes take place those savings will flow directly to investors.”      This fee structure makes the fund cheaper than GBTC but more expensive than other new funds like CrossTower’s master-feeder bitcoin fund, which has a 0.6% management fee that encompasses other fees.      Fidelity Digital Assets is the custodian for the Osprey fund, Grant Thornton is the auditor and Coin Metrics is the index provider.      If the SEC begins to approve bitcoin ETFs, then the value of funds like Osprey and GBTC could diminish significantly. In that case, Osprey would “look very closely at converting” to an ETF structure, King said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/02/16/osprey-funds-bitcoin-trust-is-now-available-to-retail-investors-via-otc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/83d66a8e817aaa2f0503f0f8065933ed491346d0-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42433625,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOztRh,1613484000,DeFi Insurer Nexus Mutual Raises $2.7M in NXM Token Sale,"Decentralized insurance alternative Nexus Mutual received a $2.7 million boost to its foundation treasury, the not-for-profit umbrella organization charged with selling NXM tokens to fund core development of the protocol.      The strategic contribution was led by Collider Ventures with participation from Nick Tomaino’s 1confirmation, Blockchain Capital, Version One, Dialectic, 1kx and several angel investors.      Nexus started out focused on providing protection against risk and potential bugs in the smart contract code of decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. Recently, the startup announced it was extending its community-based offering to cover users for hacks and losses incurred at centralized exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, Kraken and Gemini.      The Nexus foundation previously raised $1.4 million from an NXM token issuance in 2018, bringing the total raised to date to $4.1 million.      When the early token sales took place, NXM was acquired by investors at around $2 per token. Since then DeFi has grown so rapidly with over $40 billion locked up in projects; NXM is currently trading at around $68, according to CoinGecko.    How NXM works    NXM is the governance token for the Nexus Mutual protocol. It is used to buy cover, vote on governance decisions and participate in risk and claims assessments. It is also used to encourage capital provision and represents ownership to the mutual’s capital.      “When Nexus launched, it granted a bunch of NXM tokens to our foundation, which has gradually sold them to cover operational costs,” Nexus Mutual CEO Hugh Karp said in an interview. “We expect to wind down the foundation as the protocol becomes more stable and fully decentralized.”      Karp said the $2.7 million token sale took place around December of last year, at the market value for NXM at that time, without stating the exact figure.    Read more: Ethereum-Based Nexus Mutual Expands Its Decentralized ‘Insurance’ to Centralized Exchanges    It has been a momentous year for Nexus. The platform saw its pool of capital covering risks within the DeFi ecosystem increase from $4 million to $100 million within the final five months of 2020.      Nexus Mutual has a very aggressive roadmap for 2021, Karp said, aiming to sell over $1 billion worth of cover spread across at least 30 protocols.      “We see Nexus Mutual as an indispensable pillar of DeFi … and decided to take a proactive approach to support the development of the platform,” Adam Benayoun, founding partner of Collider Ventures, said in a statement.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | BNB | TOKEN SALE,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/02/16/defi-insurer-nexus-mutual-raises-27m-in-nxm-token-sale,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/366893e9e9506437bb13b4f4ec9f099ad54d0582-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The gain took the year-to-date return to about 70%, and traders immediately began to discuss what comes next.    ""We’re still in the midst of a violent bull run that will soon be more violent,” Ari Paul, chief investment officer of BlockTower Capital, tweeted Sunday.  ""We're concerned about the pace of these market moves and would therefore recommend proceeding with caution over the short term,"" Joel Kruger, cryptocurrency strategist at LMAX Digital, said in an email. NOTE: A price correction on Monday led to more than $520 million of futures-positions liquidations.  Bank of America, in a monthly investor survey of the ""most crowded trades,"" said that ""long bitcoin"" – bets on further price gains – slipped to second place behind ""long tech."" Bets against the U.S. dollar (""short dollar"") ranked third.    In traditional markets, U.S. stock futures pointed toward a higher open. ""The reflation trade is powering assets tied to economic growth and price pressure, including commodities and cyclical stocks,"" Bloomberg News reported. ""At the same time, investors are riding a wave of speculative euphoria from penny stocks to bitcoin amid abundant policy support.""    The News    CRYPTO CRUSH: Signs continued to mount of greater mainstream acceptance of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.    Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy plans a new sale of $600 million of convertible notes and will use the net proceeds to buy more bitcoin.  Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest lender, is exploring cryptocurrency custody, with aspirations to offer high-touch services to hedge funds that invest in the asset class, CoinDesk's Ian Allison reported Friday.  Morgan Stanley's $150 billion Counterpoint Global investment unit is considering placing a bet on bitcoin, according to a report by Bloomberg, which cited people familiar with the matter.  The city of Miami, following the lead of Mayor Francis Suarez, voted late last week to study the use of cryptocurrencies to pay for services or worker salaries while launching educational campaigns in English, Spanish and Creole.    VERGE SNAFU: Verge, a small cryptocurrency serving as a payments option on Pornhub, suffered a massive 560,000-block reorganization Monday, according to researchers at Coin Metrics.    The past 200 days of Verge transaction history ""just vanished,"" wrote Coin Metrics network data analyst Lucas Nuzzi. He described the event as ""likely the deepest reorg that has ever taken place in a 'top 100' cryptocurrency.""  Verge's official Twitter account said the ""dev team has released a fix,"" and everything should be ""business as usual"" in ""13 hours,"" CoinDesk's Zack Voell reported.  The cryptocurrency previously known as DogecoinDark is no stranger to network attacks. It suffered similar but less severe exploits in April 2018 and May 2018.  Market Moves    Nouveau riche emerge as crypto market cap tops $1.5 trillion      The market value of all cryptocurrencies has topped $1.5 trillion for the first time, and it's interesting to note just how much of that growth has been fueled by speculation over which projects might be the most promising, rather than just the pumping of also-ran tokens that dominated the industry's top ranks in recent years.      Sure, the industry leaders bitcoin and Etherum's ether still dominate the charts, representing roughly $1.1 trillion of the total. But the top 10 tokens now include cardano (ADA), polkadot (DOT), Binance coin (BNB) and chainlink (LINK) – all associated with projects perceived as having at least some claim on helping to create the future of finance.      They're crypto's nouveau riche, climbing in the industry hierarchy at the expense of XRP (XRP), litecoin (LTC) and bitcoin cash (BCH), which held sway until recently but apparently have failed to inspire traders to the same degree.      Some companies in the growing arena of decentralized finance (DeFi), a subsector of the crypto industry where entrepreneurs are using blockchain technology to design automated versions of lenders and trading platforms, are raising money through token sales the way a Silicon Valley startup might sell an equity interest to a venture-capital fund.      In fact, Synthetix, a decentralized trading project, has just raised $12 million from investors Coinbase Ventures, Paradigm and IOSG – apparently through a sale of the project's associated SNX tokens. ""The raise looks to be a rare occurrence of VCs investing through the purchase of a platform’s native token directly from its treasury rather than wiring funds to its founders,"" CoinDesk's Daniel Kuhn wrote Sunday. The SNX tokens have tripled in price this year to a market value of about $2.9 billion.      ""Individually, none of these may make sense, and no one can really predict who actually will win,"" John Wu, president of Ava Labs, said in an interview. His company backs the Avalanche blockchain, whose native AVAX cryptocurrency is up roughly 10-fold this year to a market value of $3 billion. And that's after the revelation of a programming bug last week triggered a quick price correction.      ""This is very similar to tech investing where people are paying for the future,"" Wu said.    Token Watch    Ether (ETH):    Staked ether in ""2.0"" deposit contract tops $5.5 billion.  Price hit new all-time high of $1,872.52 on Feb. 12.  Simon Peters, cryptoasset analyst for the trading platform eToro, wrote in an email: ""Supply is constrained by investors depositing coins off the network, and buying from institutional investors continues to climb.""  Denis Vinokourov, head of research for crypto prime broker Bequant: ""The amount of bitcoin locked on Ethereum remains on a relentless trend higher (174k as of this morning), underpinning the 'hunt for yield' trade, which, combined with the surge higher by BTC resulted in the total value locked on DeFi platforms surging to over $40 billion. However, the well documented double-edged sword of a 'hyperactive' Ethereum network with erratic gas fees continues to wreak havoc and cause hour-long delays in transaction validations, yet again squeezing out the smaller market participants. The time for platforms to put more focus on layer-2 solutions is here, and doing so will prove beneficial for the broader ecosystem because it will likely drive many users towards decentralized exchanges.""    Dogecoin (DOGE):    Price has fallen in five of the past eight days to about 5.8 cents.  Slide accelerated after Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted on Sunday: ""If major dogecoin holders sell most of their coins, it will get my full support. Too much concentration is the only real issue imo.""  One dogecoin address holds 27% of meme token's supply, according to Decrypt.    Avalanche (AVAX):    An unusually high volume of transactions highlighted a code bug that severely crippled the Avalanche blockchain last week, but funds were never at risk, an engineer Ava Labs, the development company behind the network, wrote in a Medium post on Sunday.  The episode represented an embarrassment for the because the ""Ethereum killer"" blockchain has touted its ability to handle high throughput.  AVAX tokens have tumbled in price since the incident, though they're still up 11-fold so far in 2021.  Opinions and Observations    STIMULUS BITCOIN WINNINGS: Americans who bought bitcoin with first $1,200 U.S. government stimulus check are up 639%.      BLOCKCHAIN POWER USAGE BETWEEN ROMANIA'S AND POLAND'S: Bitcoin and six other proof-of-work blockchains use between 55.1 terawatt-hours of electricity per year (roughly the energy footprint of Romania) and 180.1 terawatt-hours (Poland or Thailand), argues Tim Swanson, founder of Post Oak Labs and head of market intelligence at Clearmatics, in paper published Sunday.      MOHAMED EL-ERIAN SEES GROWING ""OFFICIAL"" RISK: ""The private sector is embracing more and more bitcoins as both a form of payment and as away to invest,"" the Allianz chief economist told CNN's Julia Chatterley in an interview.

42433626,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOztXh,1613480638,What Really Happened When Robinhood Suspended GameStop Trading,"Robinhood’s users blamed the brokerage for suspending the trading of GameStop stock and other securities last month, amid a buying frenzy kick-started by retail traders on a Reddit forum.      But Robinhood may not have had a choice. Robinhood, after all, is just one player in a public securities market that has been built over decades. In this system, brokerage apps like Robinhood are only the visible tips of an iceberg, but the actual transactions and settlement remain hidden from the public. Much control remains in the hands of a single centralized custodian: the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC).      Settlement occurs when the stock is delivered to the buyer and the funds are delivered to the seller. Often the intermediary – the DTCC – is responsible for facilitating this delivery, at least in the public securities market. The brokerage would send the customer’s funds to the DTCC by way of its clearing firm.      The DTCC controls rates, acts as the counterparty for most transactions and underpins the entire public securities market.      It also has a subsidiary, called the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC), that’s responsible for clearing and settlement services, as well as a subsidiary called the Depository Trust Company (DTC) that is responsible for record-keeping and clearing for corporate and municipal securities.      The DTCC calculates the cash margin requirements for stocks, and publishes the data to its website. Brokers can take this information and use it to model what the markets are doing, said Carlos Domingo, CEO and founder of Securitize, a security token firm and registered transfer agent with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).      Clearing firms also use this information to determine the margin requirements for brokers, which helps them ensure they have sufficient cash on hand.      When certain stocks become volatile, for example due to a coordinated effort to purchase them and boost their price, the clearing firm might charge more to settle the trades. Apps like Webull, M1 and Public all cited clearing firm charges when they suspended the trading of stocks like GME last month.      Robinhood said in a blog post published at the end of January said that it, too, suspended trading in GME and other securities due to clearing firm costs.    History    Before we get into what happened with GameStop, it’s worth looking at why the DTCC exists at all, as well as the decades of infrastructure the U.S. securities market is based on.      Trades used to be settled by transacting with physical pieces of paper, Domingo said. In the 1960s, Wall Street back offices were unable to keep up with the daily trading volume, something referred to as the Wall Street Paperwork Crisis.      “They had to shut down Wall Street on Wednesdays to settle trades,” he said. “They were looking at two options to digitize or automate this system. One could be a peer-to-peer settlement where brokers could settle against each other, or they could use a centralized custodian, and that’s how the DTCC was born.”    Read more: Reddit, Robinhood, Citadel CEOs to Testify at GameStop Hearing    Settlement trades dropped from five days (T+5) to three days (T+3), and later two days (T+2).      T+2 only occurred in the last few years, said Gautam Gujral, general counsel and co-founder of digital asset management platform Vertalo.      “To effectuate that slight change from T+3 to T+2, took something like six years of unheralded efforts by Wall Street to accomplish that,” he said.    How do trades settle now?    While Robinhood mostly blamed clearing costs for stopping trades, CEO Vlad Tenev also pointed to settlement times as an issue, saying the two-day gap creates risk for investors.      For the sake of simplification, let’s walk through a hypothetical. If I were to sign up to some brokerage app like Robinhood, Webull or Cash App (as some examples), I could buy and sell securities available on the public market. These include stocks like GME or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Some brokers also now allow customers to purchase cryptocurrencies, though there may be restrictions in trading or transferring these to off-platform wallets. Here’s what this hypothetical process might look like:    I would buy a share of a stock, let’s call it $STOCK, on this app.  The order would go to the app’s internal order management system (OMS).  The OMS would route the order to an exchange or to another broker-dealer.  After the order is matched, the exchange would tell the app.  All of the exchange’s orders would go to the continuous net settlement process, which aggregates all of a company’s trades into one long and one short position on the NSCC.    What this means, however, is that when you buy a share on Robinhood and it appears in your portfolio, that doesn’t necessarily mean you actually “own” it or that that transaction has been settled, Domingo said.      Some apps – Domingo pointed to JPMorgan as one example – show unsettled transactions, but “Robinhood doesn’t do anything like that.”      “The fact that the people trade on Robinhood, they think it’s like buying bitcoin because they buy bitcoin and it shows up on their account,” he said. Nor is this a new problem.      Robinhood could have taken steps to mitigate the trading halt last month, Domingo said. If the company had better modeled what was happening with the GME market and other volatile stocks, it could have predicted the cash requirements.      “The fact that Robinhood missed that, in my opinion, is a sign of mismanagement on their side,” he said. “They did definitely make people lose money because of their lack of planning.”    Why not T+0?    Robinhood CEO Tenev claimed that T+0 would prevent volatile markets like those seen with GameStop and AMC.      “Investors are left waiting for their trades to clear, and the clearing brokers have their proprietary cash locked up, until the settlement is final days after the trade,” Tenev wrote in a February blog post. “The clearinghouse deposit requirements are designed to mitigate risk, but last week’s wild market activity showed that these requirements, coupled with an unnecessarily long settlement cycle, can have unintended consequences that introduce new risks.”      However, moving to a shorter settlement needs broad buy-in from the securities market industry.      Shifting from T+3 to T+2 required industry approval, and further shortening of the settlement cycle will similarly require participants to agree, Gujral said.      A spokesperson for DTCC referred CoinDesk to a blog post on its website when reached for comment, titled “Why Shortening the Settlement Cycle Will Benefit the Industry & Investors.”      The post, a question-and-answer session with managing director Michael McClain, also said that industry participants are hesitant to further shorten the settlement cycle.    Read more: After GME, Dogecoin and Bitcoin, Chinese Traders Are Betting What Will Pump Next    “Although DTCC’s equities clearing and settlement subsidiaries, NSCC and DTC, can support some T+1 and even same-day settlement using existing technology, many market participants don’t leverage this option because of market structure complexities, legacy business and operational processes,” the post said.      Moving to same-day settlement could risk lowering the liquidity that the current market supports, the DTCC post said.      The technology exists to further shorten settlement time, Domingo said. The DTCC has even studied whether security tokens or other decentralized solutions might be more efficient. A similar study was conducted by the Bank of Canada.      “The conclusion was the same. From a technology perspective this can be done, but these people are trading with more money than they have,” he said.      There are trade-offs with moving to a shorter settlement time as well. The current T+2 model allows for customers and brokers to send transactions on credit, but this would be more difficult and risky at T+1 or T+0.      “They can do that with the current model because it isn’t instant settlement,” Domingo said.    Can blockchain fix this?    The DTCC’s post also noted that the entity has been looking into whether distributed ledger technology is a solution for lowering settlement times.      “We know there [are] settlement efficiencies to using blockchain. It’s already developing in the private securities market, [though] not so at all in the public securities market,” Gujral said. “At the very least what needs to happen is the market needs to start studying how to utilize either a private or public blockchain to start doing this, utilizing fairly instantaneous settlement.”      However, these benefits seem to largely only apply to private securities markets, which are smaller and less liquid.      Tenev wrote “technology is the answer” in his blog post advocating for faster settlement. Still, while eliminating third-party intermediaries could streamline parts of the process, it could also create certain risks on the financial side for brokers and customers.

There’s also a question of whether any blockchain currently functioning can support the public U.S. securities market and the sheer volume of transactions that would require.      “Blockchain does fix a bunch of this stuff but we’re still developing the architecture and ecosystem that does that,” Gujral said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/16/what-really-happened-when-robinhood-suspended-gamestop-trading,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f711ea95f68796dbfea233d1c562e447705134f6-1500x1002.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a Reuters report Tuesday, the move pushed ""long bitcoin"" back into the number two slot, having been most crowded trade in January.      Bitcoin saw a surge in capital inflow last month, with prices reaching then-record highs above $40,000 on Jan. 8 – a 300% gain from early October lows near $10,000.

In a discovery letter addressed to Federal Judge Analisa Torres at the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the parties said that having previously discussed the matter, they ""do not believe there is a prospect for settlement at this time."" They further noted that previous settlement discussions took place under the Trump administration and were mainly conducted with division directors who have since left the SEC.      More widely, the letter addresses the discovery for the pending trial, with two parties agreeing (or not) the formal process of exchanging information about the witnesses and evidence they'll be presenting.      In December, the SEC sued Ripple over alleged violations of federal securities laws. It said the company, CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Chairman Chris Larsen sold over $1 billion in XRP to retail investors without registering the cryptocurrency as a security or seeking an exemption.      Notably, the SEC told the judge in Monday's letter it is seeking to take five depositions beyond the 10 normally allowed over allegations ""Ripple and Larsen received two legal memos warning them that there was some risk that XRP would be considered 'investment contracts' and therefore securities under the federal securities laws.""
