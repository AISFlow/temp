25283098,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=601651,1712358021,Bitcoin’s Recovery Rally: Breaking Through This Level Is Key To Bullish Momentum – Analyst,"Over the past week, Bitcoin (BTC) has struggled to move significantly to the upside as the leading cryptocurrency has entered a consolidation phase below the $69,000 mark. This subdued volatility departs from Bitcoin’s usual fluctuations, raising speculation about a potential stagnation phase in its market trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Roar: Analysts Predict Surge To $82,000 Amid Bullish Pennant Formation Anticipation Builds For Bitcoin’s Next Rally The cryptocurrency community has closely monitored Bitcoin’s movements, especially as it approaches crucial resistance levels. Insights from prominent crypto analyst Captain Faibik shed light on Bitcoin’s current outlook. Captain Faibik suggests that Bitcoin could be on the brink of a significant breakout, contingent upon surpassing the $70,000 resistance threshold. According to the crypto analyst, the BTC “Bulls must Clear the $70,000 Resistance area to Confirm the upside Breakout.” $BTC is Bouncing back Nicely but still Consolidating within the Triangle. Bulls must Clear the 70k Resistance area to Confirm the upside Breakout.#Crypto #Bitcoin #BTC pic.twitter.com/NxAz8Y1ktq — Captain Faibik (@CryptoFaibik) April 5, 2024 Another crypto analyst, Jelle, Echoes similar sentiments and emphasizes the importance of patience among investors, particularly with the impending Bitcoin halving event on the horizon. Notably, the Halving is a pre-programmed event built into the Bitcoin protocol that occurs approximately every four years within the Bitcoin network to reduce the reward for mining new BTC blocks. Despite Bitcoin’s recent consolidation, anticipation for a potential rally above the $70,000 mark continues to build within the crypto community, especially as the halving is now less than 20 days away. This is because the halving ultimately decreases the supply of new BTC, and reduced supply often leads to increased demand and speculative buying. Hope For Bitcoin Bull Run Jelle’s analysis underscores the historical precedent of Bitcoin’s price movements, noting that previous all-time highs were often preceded by periods of consolidation and uncertainty. Related Reading: Bitcoin Teeters On The Edge Of Glory: Will It Smash The $70,000 Resistance? Drawing attention to bullish indicators such as the pennant formation and strong support levels, Jelle predicts a breakout in the coming weeks, providing hope for investors seeking upward momentum in Bitcoin’s price trajectory. While #Bitcoin did not break $69,000 in one go, it looks like it’s forming a new higher low here. Hold $66,500, and we’ll be at $69k again soon. Be patient – the halving is approaching fast. pic.twitter.com/LgMjodV4mF — Jelle (@CryptoJelleNL) April 5, 2024 Meanwhile, current market data indicates a favorable environment for retail traders, with Glassnode reporting increased Bitcoin accumulation by short-term holders since December 2023. This trend suggests growing confidence among retail investors in Bitcoin’s long-term potential, further fuelling expectations for a potential rally beyond $70,000.

25281033,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=601652,1712354404,FTX Estate Offloads $1.9 Billion Worth Of Locked Solana (SOL) Tokens In Sale,"In a significant development, FTX bankruptcy trustees have reportedly sold about two-thirds of a $2.6 billion stash of Solana (SOL) at a “deeply discounted price.” Industry figures such as Galaxy Trading and Pantera Capital were among the investors involved in the deal, according to people familiar with the matter, as reported by Bloomberg. SOL Tokens’ Four-Year Journey Per the report, the FTX estate was able to sell between 25 million and 30 million locked-up Solana coins at $64 each, generating up to $1.9 billion in proceeds for the estate. Under Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital, Galaxy Trading managed to raise approximately $620 million for a fund established to purchase SOL from the FTX estate. According to the report, investors in the vehicle will be subject to a 1% management fee, and the investment will offer a yield through staking. Related Reading: Dogecoin Deflates: What’s Behind The 20% Price Drop Amidst Memecoin Mania? It is worth noting that the 41 million Solana tokens sold by the FTX estate are locked according to a pre-agreed vesting period, preventing them from being available for trading on the market. According to Bloomberg, these tokens will gradually become available for sale over the course of four years, which could significantly impact SOL’s price action. However, as the tokens remain locked, SOL’s 739% year-to-date (YTD) uptrend remains intact, and the possibility for further gains remains in the cards. Solana Sale Garners Interest From Prominent Figures FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried, convicted of fraud and sentenced to 25 years in prison, was a major supporter of SOL. As previously reported, Bankman-Fried has actively engaged with guards at the Metropolitan Detention Center, where he is currently incarcerated. He offers investment advice and recommends SOL as a potential opportunity, demonstrating his bullish sentiment on the protocol. The token, which operates on the Solana blockchain, constituted a significant portion of the digital assets stranded on the collapsed exchange, creating shockwaves throughout the crypto markets. In addition to Galaxy Digital, Bloomberg notes that selling SOL tokens has attracted the attention of Pantera Capital. This $5.2 billion asset manager has reportedly raised capital for a special fund to acquire up to $250 million of SOL from the FTX estate. Vancouver-based Neptune Digital Assets Corp. also announced the purchase of 26,964 SOL tokens for $1.7 million on March 27. However, FTX creditors are concerned they will be under-compensated in the SOL sale process. Creditors Dispute FTX Bankruptcy Ruling In January, the judge overseeing the bankruptcy case ruled that the amount of each claim should be based on what the customer or creditor was owed on the day FTX filed for bankruptcy. At that time, SOL was trading at about $16, well below its current market price. As the price of SOL rallied in recent months, this discrepancy became a point of contention for some creditors. One creditor, Sunil Kavuri, expressed during Bankman-Fried’s final sentencing hearing that the SOL coins are “our property.” Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts ADA Price Crash To $0.34, Why Is Cardano Founder Bullish? Another creditor, whose name was redacted in court documents, stated in a written statement that the FTX estate is “giving away money for free to hedge funds.” In a recent interview, Bankman-Fried claimed the following regarding clients’ growing concerns about underpayment: I’ve heard and seen the despair, frustration, and sense of betrayal from thousands of customers; they deserve to be paid in full, at current price. That could and should have happened in November 2022, and it could and should happen today. It’s excruciating to see them waiting, day after day. Currently, the price of SOL stands at $175, reflecting a decrease of up to 6.7% within the last 24 hours and over 7% over the past week.

Nevertheless, there is still a lot of steam left in the cryptocurrency it seems, as crypto analysts have identified both a bottom and a 7-year cycle that could send its price as high as $40. Dogecoin To Bottom Around $0.16 In an analysis posted on X (formerly Twitter), crypto analyst Trader Mayne posited that Dogecoin could find a bottom around $0.16. He explains that this is the level where bulls are mounting support, making it a critical point for the meme coin. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Hitting $100,000 In 2024 Is Inevitable, Here’s Why Now, if the bulls are able to hold this support level, it would mean that the DOGE price has eventually found its bottom. However, falling below this support level could be detrimental for the meme coin’s price, as Trader Mayne revealed, leading to an even larger correction from here. On the flip side, if bulls are able to hold this support, then it could signal a continuation of the bullish trend. The crypto analyst reports that the RR (Risk Ratio) for longs has skewed positive. So, in this case, holding above the $0.16 support and eventually reclaiming the previous local peak just below $0.24, then “the party continues,” the analyst stated. DOGE Price Headed To $40? Trader Mayne is not the only crypto analyst who has shown bullishness toward Dogecoin in spite of the decline. Another analyst, identified as Tardigrade, also took to X to share a cycle trend in the DOGE price that they had uncovered. The crypto analyst titled the trend the “Cycle of 7 years” which predicts a large move up to new all-time high levels for the meme coin. Tardigrade points to the performance of Dogecoin in the seven years leading up to the 2021 surge, a cycle that they believe is set to repeat again. $Doge is running in the “Cycle of 7 years”🔥 We can see a similar price action in the first half of the current cycle, compared to that of last cycle. When we were at $0.0007 in 2017, we never believed $Doge would spike to $0.003, $0.009 & $0.35 T~O~D~A~Y~: We are at $0.22, we… pic.twitter.com/G2tcCNhX2y — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) April 1, 2024 Related Reading: Injective Whales Go On $24.8 Million Buying Spree, Is This The Next Solana? Given that seven years is a wide range, it means that in 2024, the DOGE price is still just halfway to completing it. From here, it would take another four years for the 7-year cycle to be completed, at the end of which Dogecoin is expected to see a massive surge. The cycle ends in 2028 and by this time, the crypto analyst expects that the DOGE price will move above $2, then $9, and all the way to $40. They support this with the fact that the DOGE price moved from $0.0007 in 2017, and reached as high as $0.7 in 2021. Given this, the analyst advises crypto investors not to miss the Dogecoin move up.

42418463,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThJHx,1712348762,What the Ethereum Community's Staking Argument Is Really About,"When is a discussion about the issuance curve of staking rewards in Ethereum not really a discussion about the issuance curve of staking rewards in Ethereum? When it’s really about Ethereum governance and Ethereum’s monetary policy.  The TL;DR on curve issuance (and why seemingly everyone is riled up about it) is as follows: on its current trajectory, it is conceivable all ETH will eventually be staked, whether directly or via restaking. Right now, almost 27% of all ETH is staked.  Paul Dylan-Ennis is a lecturer in the College of Business, University College Dublin and author of ""Absolute Essentials of Ethereum.""  Starting with a post in February on the Ethereum research forum, Ethereum protocol developers and researchers have started the discussion about how best to address it, with the key change centering on a new issuance reward formula that makes staking past a certain point unattractive.  See also: Ethereum Could Face 'Hidden Risks' From Ballooning Restaking Market  Exciting stuff! Except, the reaction on social media has tended to focus less on the technical details of this proposal and more on the idea that it involves changing Ethereum’s monetary policy. In other words, it’s not really issuance that is at stake, so much as people have a sense that the “Core Devs” (a somewhat ambiguous term in Ethereum), particularly those associated with the Ethereum Foundation, have not engaged in the appropriate level of “rough consensus” from the wider set of stakeholders.  The critics tend to be Ethereans associated with the “ultra sound money” subculture that hopes to establish ETH as sound money (in a similar way as people think of bitcoin as sound money). For them, changing the issuance curve is a red line because it’s reminiscent of central bankers constantly tweaking monetary policy.  Who are these wider stakeholders? In my reading, the Ethereum ecosystem encompasses everyday users, node operators, validators/stakers, niche Ethereum media and podcasts and dApp builders. In at least two recent media articles, these stakeholders are referred to as the community and the community is either “up in arms” or pushing back against the proposal.  The Core Devs are, of course, part of that community, but it’s also clear they have an outsized influence on the protocol relative to the other stakeholders. Further, what we are really talking about here are the various researchers who are paid by the Ethereum Foundation. — because, well, the Ethereum Foundation is one of the few organizations that pays people to focus on protocol research.  See also: Crypto Staking 101: What Is Staking?  Now, here is where nuance is important. Especially since we live in an era of actual conspiracy theories about the Ethereum Foundation, e.g. the ludicrous world of “ETHGate.” As a researcher of Ethereum governance, my view is the EF is not “in control” of Ethereum. It is also worth mentioning the Ethereum Foundation is engaged in a process it calls subtraction where it will phase itself out. In truth, there are large numbers of Core Devs who are completely independent of the Ethereum Foundation and this is especially true when we include the autonomous software client teams.  It might be time to consider mechanisms for community feedback.  However, it’s also clear to me that while the influence of the foundation is overstated by critics, it’s also understated by its defenders. We know just 10 people are responsible for 68% of all implemented Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). And if you follow Ethereum protocol development at all you can probably guess the 10. Hard forks are announced via the EF blog. The logistics of the AllCoreDevs meetings are mostly handled by people associated with the Ethereum Foundation. So, it’s not hard to see why some people fall for the impression that the EF runs the show.  See also: What Happens if the SEC Classifies ETH a Security?  I would argue that this is really a problem of communication. As Ethereum developer Tim Beiko notes, most Core Devs see the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians Forum and the Ethereum Research Forum as places to discuss and debate work-in-progress research, but many in the broader community misread it as the place where final research is shared — and everyone just has to accept it.  But as Beiko points out, there were efforts by the two authors at the Ethereum Foundation who suggested reducing the pace of ETH issuance – Casper and Ansgar – to spread their message, including an appearance on the Uncommon Core podcast. Unfortunately, people tend to focus on X as if it were the medium for Ethereum governance discussion.  Interestingly, in response to a post by Hasu, Ansgar notes that they could have done a better job, but also that he thinks the backlash is a sign of Ethereum’s robust decentralization at work. Which is true! The community does have its voice and the ability to contest research it does not like (at least in its current form).  How then to dispel the idea that Ethereum governance is the preserve of the Ethereum Foundation? One path is what we see with layer 2s starting to involve themselves more closely in governance, as with layer 2 RollCall’s attempts at creating common standards. Or dApp builders lobbying for EIPs.  What these stakeholders have grokked is that Ethereum governance is in principle open to anyone. There is nothing to stop you from writing your own research on the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians Forum and the Ethereum Research Forum. There is nothing to stop you from championing your own EIPs. Or attending the AllCoreDevs meetings.  See also: How to Stake: 7 Strategies for Starting Out  Another overlooked angle is the importance of independent observers through specialist podcasts. Sassal’s The Daily Gwei and Christine Kim’s The Infinite Jungle both cover protocol governance closely and to my mind act as important independent advocates. A perfect recent example is Christine Kim at EthDenver asking Prysm developers why they don’t focus more on the user and developer experience.  Thinking bigger, it might be time to consider mechanisms for community feedback. Something I’ve proposed before is an annual Ethereum Assembly (at EthCC or so) where different stakeholders in the wider Ethereum ecosystem could voice their concerns about any EIPs. But people tend to think this could be a centralizing force, so perhaps it's a no-go.  Alternatively, it might be interesting to explore the idea of an online feedback mechanism. Perhaps a window of one month annually where everyone else can post their concerns or issues regarding new research directions, hard forks, the Roadmap, etc. which Core Devs could review, as a sanity check. I think this would address some issues that are not going to go away otherwise.  In the end, without such a mechanism for feedback Ethereum’s “social layer” is limited to X, which is an adversarial platform and tends to encourage our worst behaviors.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | RESEARCH | FORKS,Paul J.

42418465,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThJK1,1712346232,"New York Jury Finds Do Kwon, Terraform Labs Liable for Fraud in SEC Case","NEW YORK – A Manhattan jury has found Terraform Labs and its co-founder, Do Kwon, liable on civil fraud charges brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in connection with the $40 billion implosion of the Terra ecosystem in May 2022, according to a Friday statement from the SEC.  The SEC accused Terraform Labs and Kwon of misleading investors about the stability of its so-called “algorithmic” native stablecoin, Terra USD (UST), and the use cases for the Terra blockchain.  The jury delivered the verdict on Friday, just two hours after lawyers for both the SEC and the defendants gave their closing arguments at the end of the nine-day trial in New York.  Jurors agreed with the SEC that Kwon and, under his direction, Terraform Labs deceived everyday investors about the nature of the supposed algorithm that kept UST pegged to the U.S. dollar. Though Kwon insinuated that it could “automatically self-heal” in the event of a de-peg, it actually relied on continuous trading activity, including large-scale trading done by institutional investors.  “We are pleased with today’s jury verdict holding Terraform Labs and Do Kwon liable for a massive crypto fraud,” Gurbir Grewal, SEC Division of Enforcement director, wrote in a statement.  “The defendants caused devastating losses for investors and wiped out tens of billions of market value nearly overnight. For all of crypto’s promises, the lack of registration and compliance have very real consequences for real people. As the hard work of our team shows, we will continue to use the tools at our disposal to protect the investing public, but it is high time for the crypto markets to come into compliance,” Grewal added.  SEC attorney Laura Meehan told the jury during her closing arguments on Friday that one of those institutional investors – Jump Trading – had made a secret deal with Kwon and Terraform Labs to rescue UST during a de-pegging event in May 2021, stepping in and buying millions of dollars of UST off-chain to reinflate its value and bring it back to parity with the dollar.  Meehan added that, after Jump’s intervention, Kwon and his company intentionally kept the firm’s rescue mission quiet, wanting instead to use the re-pegging as evidence of the algorithm’s effectiveness.  Lawyers for Terraform Labs and Kwon attempted to wave Jump’s involvement away as a regular part of their relationship with Terraform Labs as a market maker. They said that all “reasonable” investors knew that the algorithm that kept UST pegged to the dollar was not a “magical machine” or “computer that functioned on its own” but instead, minting and burning done by market participants.  The jury, as evidenced by their verdict, did not agree.  A spokesperson for Terraform Labs told CoinDesk: “We are very disappointed with the verdict, which we do not believe is supported by the evidence. We continue to maintain that the SEC does not have the legal authority to bring this case at all, and we are carefully weighing our options and next steps.”  Kwon was not in Manhattan for his civil trial; instead, he was stuck in Montenegro, where he had been since his arrest in March 2023. Kwon was caught en route to Dubai attempting to use fake Costa Rican travel documents after months on the run.  Kwon also faces criminal charges in the U.S. and his native South Korea, which are tied to the implosion of the Terra ecosystem. Both countries are currently vying for his extradition, but his final destination remains unclear as Montenegro's Supreme Court weighs the competing requests.

25276137,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=601639,1712345450,History Favors Bitcoin Bulls Despite Crypto Hedge Funds Increasing Shorts,"Bitcoin may be dripping lower at spot rates. Still, one analyst is unfazed, expecting the coin to reverse recent losses and snap up firmly before peaking in December 2024. At spot rates, BTC is down roughly 11% from 2024 peaks and struggling to generate sufficient buying pressure, looking at the formation in the daily chart. Will History Support Bitcoin And Rally To Fresh Highs? Taking to X, the analyst highlights historical price patterns using the 2-week Fisher Transform indicator, a tool for picking out potential reversal zones like double tops or bottoms. Though the technical indicator lags, it has accurately picked out peaks in the past. Related Reading: Dogecoin Deflates: What’s Behind The 20% Price Drop Amidst Memecoin Mania? In 2021, when Bitcoin soared to over $69,000, the Fisher Transfer indicator printed a signal, highlighting potential peaks. In the coming weeks following this signal, prices crashed. By the end of 2022, Bitcoin had fallen to as low as $16,000, accelerated by the collapse of FTX and the bankruptcy of several other popular crypto hedge funds, including Three Arrow Capital (3AC). The analyst also emphasizes the importance of the indicator in differentiating between a double top, mirroring 2017 and 2021, and a potential single peak later this year. Presently, the trader said prices are approaching 2017 levels. Then, prices created what the analyst described as a “more subtle initial rise” before peaking six months later at over $20,000. If this leads, and the indicator “pauses” where it is, Bitcoin will likely record a “single top.” However, only time will tell where this top will be at. Hedge Funds Were Selling At Tops? This prediction comes amid significant bearish bets by leveraged hedge funds. Data from the United States Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) reveals that these funds held record “short” positions in Bitcoin futures contracts by last week. Observers note this was the largest short position since 2017, at over 16,000 contracts. By shorting, they expected prices to dump, which is precisely what’s happening at spot rates. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Go On 1.2 Million BTC Buying Spree, Is Retail Finally Here? However, even as hedge funds short, another analyst, responding to the trend, said the futures premium remained high. This is a development that some of these crypto hedge funds are taking advantage of. The number of shorts could increase in the days ahead as United States Federal Reserve officials appeared to be hawkish and upbeat economic data started pouring in. Being a data-driven central bank, the Federal Reserve might not slash rates as fast as initially projected.

42418462,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThJGv,1712344727,Bitcoin Mining’s Boon for Small Town America,"It isn’t always clear how crypto is changing lives. The incorporality of blockchain ledgers, the fact that crypto wallets are online (not made of leather) and the limited number of real world use cases all contribute to the common view that crypto, at most, is silly internet money. But for as ethereal as Ethereum is, crypto does have an actual footprint.  That idea is at the center of a new documentary about Bitcoin mining by Will Foxley, ex-CoinDesker turned independent crypto media mogul. Released today, “The Big Empty,” tells the story of when digital asset heavyweight Galaxy Digital descends on the small, rural and nearly hollowed out city of Spur (population: 863).  Unlike many stories about bitcoin mining, which tend to focus on the industry’s intense energy footprint (and whether that is good or bad), “The Big Empty” is first and foremost about people. About the former East Coast Galaxy employees who moved to West Texas and learned to adjust, about the locals whose families settled in the area generations ago and about the lives changed by a new industry.  In a way, Bitcoin mining was destined to become a controversial topic by the way the network was designed. The proof-of-work algorithm that keeps Bitcoin humming burns through energy without limit. Every year, it seems, more mines open — often using carbon-intensive sources of energy, sometimes even firing up defunct coal power plants.  See also: The Honest Truth About Bitcoin Mining, Energy and the Environment  But on the ground that debate seems muted, at least as the documentary presents it. The energy mix of miners and looming threat of climate change are as incorporeal and distant as Bitcoin itself. To the extent that Spur’s residents seem concerned about the giant Helios mine opening a few miles down the road, it’s often just because of the jobs it has been providing.  “The small towns [bitcoin mines] inhabit often don't have many high paying or stable jobs,” Foxley told CoinDesk in an interview. “There may be a few retail shops, convenience stores, things like that, but it's not a lot.”  To say that Galaxy is single handedly revitalizing the town of Spur might be overstating the case , but it seems incontrovertible that it has a presence. But as much as the doc highlights Galaxy’s good deeds (like reopening a beloved public pool), it is also a story about, as Foxley says, keeping that up and learning to be “a good neighbor,” which isn’t necessarily assured in the long haul.  CoinDesk caught up with Foxley to talk about his latest documentary, what attracted him to the story of Spur in particular and why it is that a massive bitcoin mine might be a good fit for a city that was previously best known as a magnet for tiny homes.  Just wanted to say it was a great doc, really well done. Are you planning to submit it to any festivals?  It was definitely a very strong team, so I can’t take all the credit. This would be my third mining specific film and fourth bitcoin doc. It’s my longest by far — I personally call it my first short film. I don't know the difference between a short film or a documentary or mini doc. I'll probably submit it to some film festivals to try to get some more traction. Will definitely screen it at some bitcoin meetups and events If we try to do any sort of streaming services, we can't go the social media route. But if someone likes it, we might be able to place it somewhere cool.  In some sense the story of bitcoin mining in the U.S. is the story of revitalization. Could you speak to what you’ve seen when touring bitcoin mines around the country?  Bitcoin miners are flocking to small towns because that's often where there's excess energy from industries that have left or cheaper power from overbuilt substations and power stations. It’s a natural place for bitcoin miners to go because they have to chase cheap energy.  The small towns they inhabit often don't have many high paying or stable jobs. They don't have any sort of industry at this point. There may be a few retail shops, convenience stores, things like that, but it's not a lot. To really revitalize a town you need some sort of industry.  Bitcoin mining is interesting because there might not be that many jobs per bitcoin mine. But you create a lot of external jobs around that. In the film, you'll see there's tons of people who work in contracting and are in and out of the facility, truck drivers, repair technicians, people pouring concrete, security guards. Even just thinking about the facility, they plan on opening up a kitchen to feed the 40 workers there. That's going to be like five to 10 new jobs.  Do you have a sense of what technicians are generally paid?  Often it’s double minimum wage, $20-$30 bucks an hour for an intro technician. It scales up from there. One of the great pieces we didn't even get to fit in the doc is that Galaxy pays 20% above the rate for the town. Bitcoin mining is a slightly more lucrative industry. So they raised a lot of people's standards of living even doing a sort of blue collar level job.  Was there something specific about Galaxy or Helios that attracted you to the story?  Mostly just access. Galaxy was interested in opening up the doors. Corporations have to be mindful of their public image, (Galaxy is publicly traded), but I was impressed by how willing they were to work with a documentary film crew, because that's not always a very comfortable experience.  The second thing — there's a lot of these Texas bitcoin mining stories that I’m not very interested in because people tend to focus on the energy or bitcoin side of things. I was really interested in the small town story, and participating in town life. Most people we talked to were immediately open to having a conversation or dialogue, which made it more attractive when we scoped it out last year.  See also: How Bitcoin Mining Has Changed Since the Last Halving  There was actually a tornado the day we landed that took out a large chunk of the neighboring town. One thing that was really interesting to see was how many people from all the surrounding towns drove out to help them out. There were miles of cars with supplies trying to get into that small town. It became pretty clear that the people who live in these towns in West Texas are just a different breed. They care about each other. They're good neighbors.  You definitely get that sense watching the movie. Especially the scene with the tiny home community. What were you trying to say by including those scenes?  So the initial name for the film actually was “Tiny Home Kingdom.” We were trying to riff on, like, tiny homes versus a mega bitcoin mine. It sounded good on paper. But you probably have to make the doc a little more silly to go that route. You know, live with someone in their tiny home for a week.  The tiny homes showed how open Spur was in working and talking with other communities outside of what you'd find normally in the Texas panhandle. They opened their doors around 2015 to become a location for tiny homes. Many cities are zoned to block tiny homes, because they find it annoying or think it lowers property valuations. Spur was trying to find an angle to bring people back. It shows that they're interested in having new neighbors — it’s just that the next neighbor to move in happened to be an 800 megawatt bitcoin mine.  Galaxy also struck a deal to reopen the town pool. Are these types of investments common for bitcoin mines?  It's pretty common to have bitcoin mines do this. I've heard other stories where it's also been a town pool. I've heard about companies fixing the community rec center. The Riot team in Rockdale funds the local softball team. It’s because, again, when you move into a small town like this you have to become a good neighbor. You have to learn what that looks like, and as a corporation that can be kind of hard. It’s not like a lot of other tech or finance jobs; the business really runs out of one small rural town that has been the same way for generations. The easiest way to ingratiate yourself into the community is often by doing something practical.  Another thing we didn't get to touch on is that Spur is a hotspot for drug issues, like a lot of low income places. We often think of drugs as being an urban problem. But it’s very much a rural problem. There's not a lot of hope and opportunity. A lot of people are born in Spur and move away to Lubbock or Austin or Dallas. And the people who are there sometimes can feel left behind. In some sense, the pool is a symbol: this big tech company cares about the local people.  Did you talk to anyone concerned about noise pollution?  Not for this site. That could be a challenge going forward because they are deploying some air units. But right now, the facility is all immersion — it's the largest immersion bitcoin mine to my knowledge in North America. The nice thing about immersion mining is it’s basically silent. And the mine itself is on its own little spot pretty far away from any housing development. About 10 miles away from the city Spur. And everything out there is at least a 20 minute drive. So there shouldn't be any noise complaints to my knowledge.  See also: The Bitcoin Mining Debate Is Ignoring the People Most Affected  Any closing thoughts?  I would like this film and other work we do to encourage people to think outside the box — about how towns can bring in businesses and about how these companies can add to communities. I think Galaxy did a really good job with that. They fulfilled their promise with this pool everyone's gonna be jumping and splashing around in. They even said that in the film, right? Like, if you're not splashing in the pool this summer, then Galaxy failed.  I do think bitcoin mining is going to become a more important conversation for local communities. If bitcoin miners don't find a good way of balancing their businesses within small towns, there's going to be more problems. It's OK for small towns to say they don't like things.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MINING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/04/05/bitcoin-minings-boon-for-small-town-america,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8db0fbbb243bf7e19b582833e9f7fb7c294b3801-1764x992.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418467,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThJL3,1712343091,"Jury Begins Deliberations in Civil Fraud Case Against Do Kwon, Terraform Labs","A New York jury has begun deliberations in the SEC’s civil fraud case against Terraform Labs and its co-founder Do Kwon  The SEC has accused the defendants of misleading investors about the stability of its so-called “algorithmic stablecoin,” Terra USD  NEW YORK – Lawyers for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rested their case against Terraform Labs and its co-founder, Do Kwon, on Friday, releasing a New York jury to decide whether Kwon and his company are liable for allegedly misleading investors about the stability of Terra USD {{UST}} and its integration with a Korean mobile payments app.  The so-called “algorithmic stablecoin” was supposed to maintain a peg to the U.S. dollar through on-chain mint-and-burn mechanics with its sister token, LUNA. But in May 2022, the UST de-pegged and began a death spiral that eventually took down the entire Terra ecosystem, wiping out approximately $40 billion in market value in its wake.  During its case, the SEC argued that Kwon and, under his direction, Terraform Labs deceived everyday investors about the nature of that algorithm, implying that it allowed UST to “naturally heal” and “automatically self-heal” in the event of a de-peg.  But there was no self-healing or algorithmic magic that kept UST pegged to the dollar, the SEC argued. Instead, the value of UST was maintained through continuous trading activity, including large-scale trading done by institutional investors.  During her closing arguments on Friday, SEC attorney Laura Meehan told the jury that during a prior de-peg in May 2021, Kwon and Terraform Labs made a “secret agreement” with Jump, a trading shop that acted as a market maker for Terraform Labs, to step in and buy millions of dollars of UST off-chain to inflate the value and bring it back to parity with the dollar.  Meehan added that after Jump’s intervention, Kwon and his company intentionally kept Jump’s involvement quiet, wanting instead to use the re-pegging as evidence of the algorithm’s effectiveness.  “Defendants lied for years. They lied about the success and size of their blockchain … they lied about the stability of their algorithm,” Meehan said. “They’re still parading themselves around like they’re a real company, like they’re legitimate.”  As Meehan neared the end of her remarks, the Manhattan courtroom gently shook – not, as District Court Judge Jed Rakoff quipped, “with the force of the SEC’s arguments” but with the tremors of a 4.8 magnitude earthquake in neighboring New Jersey.  Defense pushes back  Lawyers for Terraform Labs and Do Kwon made their closing arguments after the SEC, pausing intermittently as emergency alerts for the earthquake periodically sounded from cell phones across the courtroom.  The defense, led by attorney Louis Pellegrino, told the jury that the mobile payment app Chai did, in fact, utilize the Terra blockchain for a variety of things, including refunding purchases and providing liquidity.  But mostly, Pellegrino’s argument focused on the alleged “secret agreement” between Jump and Terraform Labs, and whether or not Kwon and his company had actually lied to investors about the nature of the algorithm.  “The mechanism was not a computer that functioned on its own,” Pellegrino said. “It wasn’t some magical machine…and everyone knew it.”  Minting-and-burning to maintain the peg had to be done by market participants, he argued, and Kwon and Terraform Labs had “never claimed” otherwise. Those market participants included companies like Jump – which Pellegrino said had a formal agreement, not a secret one, to provide liquidity to Terraform Labs when needed.  “All reasonable purchasers knew about the risks,” Pellegrino argued, pointing to a trading memo from Galaxy Digital citing the inherent risk of a collapse of the ecosystem.  When that collapse eventually came, Pellegrino said, it was as the result of a devastating short attack – carried out by hedge funds including Wintermute Trading, Celsius, and Jane Street – that made Terraform Labs a victim alongside its investors.  “Terraform is still here, trying to make things better,” Pellegrino said. “Terraform is no house of cards.”  Terraform Labs filed for bankruptcy protection in January. During his testimony earlier this week, current CEO Chris Amani testified that the company had approximately $150 million in assets remaining and that he made an annual salary of $3 million.  No Do  Former CEO and defendant Do Kwon was absent from court for the duration of the trial. Kwon remains in Montenegro, where he has been since his March 2023 arrest for using fake Costa Rican travel documents en route to Dubai after months on the lam.  Kwon served a prison sentence for his crime but was released on bail and placed under house arrest in the Balkan country last month. The country’s Supreme Court is currently weighing competing extradition requests from the U.S. and South Korea, Kwon’s native country, which both want to try him on criminal fraud charges in addition to civil ones.  Kwon’s ultimate destination remains unclear.

42418461,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThJFt,1712342382,Did Strong Bitcoin ETF Demand Kill Halving's Potential Bullish Rally?,"Bitcoin's upcoming halving might not have as much of an impact on the price of bitcoin as seen in previous cycles, experts predict.  This is because the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have already pushed bitcoin to new highs as pressure on supply strengthened.  Nevertheless, the long-term effects on both the price of bitcoin and subsequently flows into the ETFs will be positive.  Bitcoin's {{BTC}} halving - which is often seen as a bullish catalyst for the price - may not be as positive as the market thinks, thanks to the approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETF).  Halving, which occurs every four years, cuts bitcoin's supply growth by half, historically causing upward pressure on the price of the largest digital asset. The previous halving cycles pushed bitcoin to new highs, and this time, strong demand from the spot ETF may add even more fuel to the rally.  “If we look at demand generally since the ETFs have launched, it has created tremendous supply shock already,” said Brian Dixon, CEO of investment firm Off the Chain Capital. “Once the halving occurs, and that supply is further reduced, it's only logical to think that the price will appreciate.”  Read more: Bitcoin Halving, Explained  On the surface, that may be the case as the demand from the funds has been significantly more than the 900 new BTC that are mined daily. And when that supply gets cut in half, it might create an even bigger pull on the prices.  However, it might not play out the same way this time.  The price of bitcoin had rallied 46% since Jan. 11, when the spot ETFs started trading in the U.S. The demand from these funds has been so strong that the price of the digital asset rallied to a new all-time high to keep up with the onslaught of bitcoin purchases. But the market may have gotten a bit ahead of itself in the hype.  “This is the first time in which bitcoin broke its all-time highs before the halving, so there is a little bit of a concern that the ETFs have pulled demand forward and that maybe we're going to linger where we are for a little bit,"" said David Lawant, Head of Research at FalconX.  Anthony Anderson, founder and CEO of Param Labs and Kiraverse, echoed this sentiment. ""Bitcoin ETFs preempted the impact of halving on supply by massively acquiring BTC since the beginning of the year.""  Also, halving might not affect the ETF flows either due to the already strong demand from the investors, at least not in the short term, according to Bloomberg Intelligence's ETF analyst James Seyffart.  Read More: Bitcoin Could Slump Around Reward Halving Time, Arthur Hayes Says  ""We know many miners use OTC desks to offload their BTC and the ETF issuers also use OTC desks to obtain their Bitcoin as flows come into the fund. So theoretically the potential halving of miner bitcoin sales could mean that ETF inflows will have a greater impact on the underlying market. But for the last few months the ETF inflows have vastly exceeded anything the miners provided from operations,"" he said.  ""So if it does have an impact it’s unlikely to be anything extremely impactful in my view,"" Seyffart added.  This is not to say that halving won't be a significant catalyst for bitcoin and the ETF flows in the long term. After all, the success of the ETFs seems to be closely correlated to the price of BTC and vice versa. The halving may even accentuate the appeal of bitcoin as an asset class to institutional investors. “I think the halving is going to be one of the best things for bitcoin since the ETFs launched,” said Bob Iacchino, co-founder of analytics firm Path Trading Partners. “At its core is an inflation protection mechanism and inflation is ramping back up.”  In fact, the hype around halving might help bitcoin bring it in front of many investors looking for alternative assets to hedge against the global macro volatility.  ""This [Halving] is happening at a time when folks are somewhat queasy about the risk that Bitcoin hedges against,"" said Lawant, pointing out that many investors are starting to pay more attention to how to protect their portfolio against any significant change in global economy and having spot ETF and an asset class with shrinking supply ""would be positive for ETF flows.""  This supply shortage might also lead to a longer-term impact on the ETF flows as it will impact bitcoin's ""marginal supply into perpetuity,"" said Seyffart. He added that, even though the impact of the marginal supply from ETF inflows in the first three months has been much higher than the halving can have, the slashing of the supply of BTC is ""permanent and goes into perpetuity.""  Whatever the case may be, the market may need to brace for volatile short-term trading for bitcoin and perhaps for the ETF flow after the halving, said Anderson, noting that in the long term, net flows for the funds should come in at a similar pace that is seen currently.

He claimed that both tokens could rise to as high as $20,000 and $20, respectively. Additionally, he stipulated when this parabolic price surge is likely to happen. Ethereum Could Hit A Market Top Near $20,000 CrediBULL Crypto mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that there is a chance that Ethereum could hit a market peak near $20,000. He further explained that ETH could attain this price level based on his belief that BTC can “realistically” see a 2x in this market cycle from its last high of $69,000 in the 2021 bull run. As such, altcoins like ETH will do “multiples of that.” Related Reading: Fantom Supply On Exchanges See Drastic Increase, A Cause For Alarm? Specifically, he foresees ETH doing a 3x to 4x of its prior all-time high (ATH) of $4,800, which puts the second largest crypto token by market cap in a price range between $15,000 and $20,000. Meanwhile, CrediBULL asserted that Ethereum will surely rise to $10,000 at the minimum. Following CrediBULL’s prediction, another X user questioned how possible it was for ETH to rise to a market cap of $2 trillion, stating that it seems “crazy.” However, the crypto analyst responded that ETH rising to such levels is a “blow off top, ” so the market cap will look “outrageous.” He jokingly added that there is a problem if the market caps don’t look outrageous. XRP Is Another Altcoin That Could Experience Exponential Growth In a different X post, CrediBULL also made a case for XRP, stating that XRP could also rise between $10 and $12 if ETH were to hit $10,000. He suggested that XRP wasn’t to be underrated despite its current underperformance, noting that XRP actually flipped ETH in terms of market cap at some point in the last cycle. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Releases List Of Top 10 Altcoins To Buy For Maximum Profit In The Bull Market Therefore, the crypto analyst added that anyone who thinks ETH hitting $10,000 is “realistic” should also believe that XRP rising to $10 is possible. In a subsequent X post, CrediBULL claimed that XRP could even rise to as high as $20 based on ETH hitting $10,000 at its current circulating supply. Again, he noted that XRP is very capable of attaining such price levels, seeing as it is a top 10 coin, which means that the market demand for it is evidently there. CrediBULL’s sentiment echoes that of Nick, the founder of Web3Alert, who previously predicted that XRP could rise to $10 since there were predictions that Bitcoin and Ethereum would rise to as high as $150,000 and $10,000, respectively. At the time of writing, ETH and XRP are trading at around $3,290 and $0.58, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42418484,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThJXR,1712339805,Ethereum Foundation Researchers' Proposal to Slow ETH Issuance Draws Pushback,"The Ethereum Foundation researchers' original goal was partly to keep the liquid-staking industry's dominance from growing even further – by reducing the incentives for new stakers.  But the proposal has led to pushback from some quarters of the community, who question whether the change is needed, or if these sorts of manual adjustments can succeed in addressing the desired changes in market demand.  The discussion also has prompted some observers to wonder aloud if the Ethereum Foundation, where Vitalik Buterin works, wields too much influence over the decentralized network.  Earlier this year, a pair of Ethereum Foundation (EF) researchers put forth a proposal to reduce the pace of new issuance of ether {{ETH}} tokens. It was part of a concerted plan to reduce incentives for new stakers – the investors who lock cryptocurrency into the blockchain as a way of helping to secure the network. The freshly minted ETH is a crucial component of the rewards these investors hope to receive, in the form of staking yields.  As the researchers' thinking went, there's already enough stakers to provide effective security for the blockchain, and in fact any additional increases in the level of participation could enable the unwanted dominance of fast-growing third-party staking platforms like Lido. A side benefit of the proposed changes would be to harden ether as a form of money, since the total supply of the cryptocurrency wouldn't grow as quickly – effectively tapering ether's inflation rate.  Now, though, some members of the community are pushing back, questioning whether there's really a need to change the tokenomics of ether and, in the extreme, whether the Ethereum Foundation plays an outsize role in influencing code upgrades on the decentralized network.  The proposal was initially introduced in February by Ansgar Dietrichs and Caspar Schwarz-Schilling, both researchers at the EF. It suggests setting the blockchain's parameters so that the annual issuance of new ETH would not exceed 0.4% – a step change lower than the current effective limit of 1.5%.  The big idea is that top Ethereum researchers are satisfied with the number of stakers already working to secure the network, so it might make sense to reduce the incentives for newcomers. The change would also avoid extra dilution for ETH investors.  The current issuance rate ""dilutes ETH holders beyond what is necessary for security,"" the researchers wrote. They estimated that the proposal would reduce ETH staking yields by nearly a third.  Some members of the Ethereum community argue that the proposal is being rushed ahead without enough time for outside feedback. Viktor Bunin, a protocol specialist at Coinbase Cloud, wrote on the social-media platform X, “If it's not broke don't fix it.”  Reduction in ETH staking yield  ETH staking is the main way the Ethereum network stays secure: Ethereum's ""proof-of-stake"" consensus model lets users deposit (""stake"") ETH with the network in exchange for yield, and to help run the chain.  The substance of Dietrichs and Schwarz-Schilling's concern is that too many ETH tokens are getting staked with the network via third-party liquid staking services like Lido – crypto protocols that stake on behalf of users, and then issue derivative assets called ""liquid staking tokens"" (LSTs) representing their users' underlying deposits.  The EF researchers say they're concerned that LSTs like Lido's stETH token – the most-traded asset on Ethereum other than the ETH token itself – could eventually replace the blockchain’s native currency as the network's de facto money, making the entire system less secure.  Ethereum's security model needs ETH to be valuable in order to work, and a chief concern driving the new proposal is that if the cryptocurrency were to fall behind LSTs, it could go down in price relative to other assets.  Mike Neuder, another researcher at the EF, expanded on the initial proposal by explaining that, as “real yield from staking goes to zero,"" stakers will need to ""rely on exogenous rewards for profitability.”  Reducing the ETH issuance rate could enhance Ethereum's economic model by making ETH scarcer, potentially increasing its value.  What is the role of the Ethereum Foundation?  Some community members, however, are pushing back on the argument that changing the tokenomics of the blockchain will improve Ethereum’s economic model.  Jon Charbonneau, co-founder at crypto investment firm DBA, wrote on X that “these tweaks try to solve an unsolvable problem of fundamental tradeoffs in PoS.” PoS stands for ""proof-of-stake,"" which is the core process or ""consensus mechanism"" used to secure the blockchain.  Paul Dylan-Ennis, a lecturer and assistant professor at the University College Dublin School of Business, wrote that “it seems to me it's not really issuance that is at stake, so much as people have a sense that EF-associated devs and researchers appear to have an outsized power.” He added that “they are not engaging in the appropriate level of 'rough consensus' from the wider set of stakeholders.”  The skepticism elicted responses from key figures within the Ethereum ecosystem, and at the Ethereum Foundation specifically.  Notably, Vitalik Buterin, the influential co-founder of the Ethereum blockchain, is one of three members of the executive board of the Ethereum Foundation, according to its website. The organization is described as a ""non-profit that supports the Ethereum ecosystem,"" and part of a ""larger community of organizations and individuals that fund protocol development, grow the ecosystem and advocate for Ethereum.""  Tim Beiko, protocol support lead at the foundation, pushed back on Dylan-Ennis’ commentary, arguing that “it's pretty empirically untrue that 'core devs' or 'the EF' are uncontested re: governance. this current conversation is a clear example.”  ""Core devs"" is shorthand for the broader, group of developers – drawn from multiple companies and organizations, as well as individuals – who participate in regular discussions over the network's rules, code, upgrades and strategy roadmap.  Beiko added that: “I think core devs + researchers generally treat ethresearch+ethmag as a place to post WIP ideas/proposals, whereas the broader community tends to perceive it as a place where the Official Roadmap gets shared after it's ~final.”  Dietrichs, the co-author of the initial proposal, responded that the ""intention was purely to propose this change for consideration to the community.""  “Of course any change to such a sensitive part of the protocol requires broad community buy-in,"" Dietrichs wrote. ""We tried to be clear about that from the beginning, but could certainly have done a better job.”  Read more: Ethereum Finalizes 'Dencun' Upgrade, in Landmark Move to Reduce Data Fees",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/04/05/ethereum-foundation-researchers-proposal-to-slow-eth-issuance-draws-pushback,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e0a664a91664f590f30e4cda1c45ff20fc3d8182-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Polygon Is Showing A TD Sequential Buy Signal Right Now In a new post on X, analyst Ali has discussed about the a Tom Demark (TD) Sequential signal forming in the MATIC price chart. The TD Sequential here refers to an indicator in technical analysis that’s generally used for pinpointing probable locations of reversal in any given asset’s value. This indicator has two phases to it, the first of which is known as the “setup.” In this phase, candles of the same polarity are counted up to nine, at the end of which the price may be assumed to have encountered a point of reversal. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Indicator May Have Signaled Latest Market Downturn In Advance Naturally, if the candles leading up to the completion of the setup had been red, the reversal would be towards the upside, while green candles would suggest a potential top for the asset. Once the setup is done with, the second phase called the “countdown” begins. This phase works similarly to the setup, except for the fact that it lasts for thirteen candles instead of nine. After these thirteen candles of the same polarity are also in, the price may be considered to have attained another likely point of reversal. Polygon has recently completed a TD Sequential phase of the former type. Below is the chart shared by Ali that shows the formation of this TD Sequential signal for the MATIC daily price. The recent pattern forming in the 1-day price of the cryptocurrency | Source: @ali_charts on X As displayed in the above graph, the Polygon daily price has finished a TD Sequential setup with a downtrend recently. This would suggest that the asset may be at a potential bottom at the moment. “If MATIC stays strong above $0.87, we could see a rebound to $0.95, or better yet, $1!” says the analyst. A potential rally to the former of these targets would suggest an increase of more than 8% from the current price, while a run to the latter level would mean growth of almost 14%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Capitulate: $5.2 Billion Sold At Loss It now remains to be seen how the Polygon price will develop from here and if the TD Sequential buy signal will end up holding or not.

42418479,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThJUL,1712335476,The EasyA Consensus Hackathon: Web3 Unicorn Breeding Ground,"You may have heard of Devin, the AI software engineer built by Cognition Labs and its massive $21 million Series A it raised, led by Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund. But did you know that just one and a half years ago, one of its co-founders was presenting his startup idea at an EasyA hackathon at Harvard?  The EasyA Consensus Hackathon takes place during CoinDesk's Consensus festival May 29-31, in Austin, Texas.  Devin is not the only project that’s raised millions from VCs having come out of an EasyA hackathon. Projects launched by EasyA alumni have been funded by a16z, YC, Founders Fund and tons of other world-class VCs. The path from learning about a blockchain on EasyA to competing at a hackathon and then raising millions of dollars in VC funding is one that is well-trodden by the EasyA community.  So well-trodden, in fact, that startups launched by EasyA hackathon winners are now valued at almost $500m. Yes, that’s almost half a billion!  And while $500 million is already an astronomical number, we want to bring it up to $1 billion. That’s why we made the decision to partner with CoinDesk this year, to bring the first ever in-person hackathon to Consensus. Running directly alongside the conference itself, at the exact same venue in Austin, we’re inviting the top 500 builders from across the world to hack at this inaugural hackathon. Accepted hackers will not only get a chance to pitch at 2024’s biggest hackathon of the year, but also a free Consensus ticket!  Here are three reasons startups should consider participating this year.  Funding opportunities  If you’re an aspiring founder looking to launch the next Web3 unicorn, funding is probably the number one thing you’re looking to secure. Together with CoinDesk, we’re bringing a ton of exciting funding opportunities to Consensus, more than you can even apply for. From hundreds of thousands of dollars in bounties to hundreds of millions more in equity-free grants and VC funding, there’s literally no better place to launch your project.  Present on-stage at Consensus  Over 15,000 blockchain professionals and pioneers will flood Consensus this year, making it the perfect place for you to launch your idea with an immediate captive audience. We’re even giving hackathon finalists the chance to present their pitches on stage at the main Consensus conference itself, meaning you’ll get to meet and pitch VCs in the crowd. It’s literally the perfect launchpad to take your idea to the moon!  Access to leading investors and founders  The world’s best investors and founders attend Consensus each year. Getting accepted to the EasyA Consensus hackathon doesn’t just give you the chance of a lifetime to pitch your blockchain project on-stage at Consensus, but it also gives you a free pass to the main Consensus Conference itself, where speakers from a16z’s Chris Dixon to Solana’s co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko will be presenting live on stage.  We’re about to start hosting Twitter spaces with each of our sponsors where we’ll be dropping alpha on what to expect from each hackathon track, bounties and how you can get ready to win! So make sure you’re following our Twitter account to stay up-to-date on important updates as we approach hackathon week.  Make sure you sign up for the hackathon right now. Spaces are limited and once they’re gone, they’re gone.

Please note that VanEck may have a position(s) in the digital asset(s) described below. Bitcoin rallied in March (+14%) for its seventh month in a row, a record streak of green monthly candles that included a new all-time high of $73,125 on March 13th. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs continued their strong performance with $5B in inflows, roughly double new BTC issuance in the month, while MicroStrategy (MSTR, mkt cap $29B) acquired $1.5B worth of Bitcoin via two new convertible bond issues. Such “TradFi” interest led to Bitcoin’s continued outperformance vs. Ethereum (+5%), whose spot ETF still remains in doubt amidst increasing chatter that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may try to classify the 2nd largest crypto asset as a security.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. In March 2024, the market capitalization of all crypto tokens increased 13% to $2.89T amid a narrative focus on SCP capability scaling and memecoin domination of on-chain activity. While March’s total crypto market cap was lower than the all-time high set on November 2022 at $3.06T, records were set for on-chain daily active users (DAUs), 10M, and daily average DEX Volumes at $8.5B. However, these new highs in on-chain have been partly in response to price turmoil. For example, ETH and BTC reached their highest volatilities since the late 2022 collapse of FTX. While BTC and ETH posted high volatility marks, ETH volatility exceeded BTC’s for the first month since September 2023. Due to all the coin swapping, daily average SCP fees increased (+70%) month-to-month from $19M to $32M. The next question one should ask is “what are people doing on-chain” and the answer we find in the data is “DeFI.” Daily Active Addresses on blockchain participating in DeFi is up 219% and has moved from 5.6% of total on-chain activity to 10.5%. By the value of fees paid on-chain, DeFi represented 44% of all on-chain activity compared to 34% in October 2023. Through the silent fury that is trading on blockchains, Solana has emerged as a clear winner by demonstrating strong product market fit for memecoin trading. This is because trading on Solana is cheap, at less than $0.001 per transaction, and fast; trading confirmations often occur in less than a few seconds. The result of this excellent user experience is that Solana’s share of DEX volumes has grown to 25% in March 2024 from 3.6% in October 2023. One of the most vexing conditions continuing to plague crypto is the decrease in active developers. Despite the emergence of many new projects (and developer incentives!), including scores of Ethereum Layer-2s, new high throughput blockchains like Sui and Aptos, and renewed interest in Bitcoin, the count of “weekly active developers” in March 2024 was less than it was in April 2021. While Ethereum has lost 70% of its “core developers,” moving from ~2k in July 2022 to ~600 today, Solana has lost 66% of its “devs,” dropping to 227 today from 816 in July 2022. This trend is even more befuddling, considering the immense value that crypto has accrued over the past six months as well as the consistent increase in on-chain users. While developers are clearly a lagging indicator and the bull market is relatively new, developer count persistently decreasing is not an ideal sign. Daily Active Users vs Developers Source: Artemis XYZ as of 3/26/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. While Ethereum had its share of interesting news and developments, the bulk of the items benefitted Ethereum L2s (see our upcoming article on Ethereum L2s). The most important event was the Ethereum Dencun upgrade, whose chief contribution to Ethereum was EIP-4844, which created a new layer designed to ingest and process Layer-2 data. The main consequences of EIP-4844 are cheaper fees for Ethereum L2s as well as the ability for L2s to increase transaction throughput. Before EIP-4844, L2s settled data from their transactions and their state updates to Ethereum using Ethereum’s transaction layer. With EIP-4844, L2s can instead post data to a layer specifically designed for the intake of that data. Using this novel layer and posting what are called “Data Blobs,” L2 now pays (-96%) less gas fees than before EIP-4484. Many would contend this to be a bearish development for the price of ETH because it purposefully reduces Ethereum revenue coming from its most profitable customers – the Layer-2 blockchains that connect to Ethereum. In fact, total revenues on Ethereum have dropped (-48%) in the 10 days following EIP-4844 versus the 10 days before its implementation. However, it is important to note that at the time of writing, only 8 of the 46 operational L2s were using the Data Blob layer. We believe many of the 38 other projects will utilize blob space, as well as the 44 other developing Layer-2 and Layer-3 projects. Current usage of Blob Space’s target utilization is around 30-40%, and the inclusion of these other projects should cause increased Blob Space usage. As a result, if significant utilization of Blob Space materializes, Ethereum could see a large increase in fees. Transactions vs. Daily Fees (ETH) Source: Etherscan as of 3/24/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. However, it is important to discuss the potential drawbacks of the Blob Layer. Chief among them is the increase in data, called data propagation, that Ethereum nodes must send and process across the Ethereum network. According to Xatu , blob transactions have slowed down the Ethereum network and the more blobs processed, the slower the Ethereum network becomes. Currently, the differences are minuscule, around 400ms, but this could become an issue if it continues to grow. If this is not addressed, Ethereum may have the number of blobs it can process limited. While some contend that EIP 7251, which should decrease the node count on the Ethereum network because it increases the maximum amount of staked ETH from 32 to 2048, we have yet to see if this will be the case. In March, there were some developments that indicate the Ethereum is far from dead. Blackrock chose to establish a $100M tokenized fund on Ethereum. Called “BUIDL,” which stands for Blackrock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, the fund will be backed by US Treasuries, cash and repo agreements. There were also some really curious raises that relate to Ethereum decentralization and scaling: Succinct zk tech for decentralized provers and other infrastructure to support L2s and co-processors $55M in a round led by Paradigm. Espresso Systems Decentralized sequencer software to scale and decentralize Ethereum L2s $28M in a round led by16z Eclipse SVM Layer-2 on Ethereum that supports Solana applications $50M in investor funding from Polychain and Hack VC These funding raises are interesting because of continued VC interest to spend large amounts of money to improve Ethereum. Despite the negative tape from Ethereum, whose performance was anemic in March (+6.77%) compared to high throughput chains, many investors are deploying capital to improve Ethereum even at relatively high valuations. Meanwhile, Base’s Jesse Pollack announced plans to scale Base’s throughput by s se.xyz) - Twitter"" target=""_blank""> 1000x its current capacity just as memecoin mania hit Base. In March, memecoin speculation caused Base’s TVL to double while its revenue surged by 200%. Additionally, Metis passed governance implementing decentralized sequencers while Prom announced it would launch a new zero-knowledge EVM. Though many contend that Ethereum is being left behind because it is not scaling its base layer, hundreds of millions of dollars are being spent to improve Ethereum’s short comings. Solana Failure Rate Non-Vote Txs Source: Dune @21co as of 3/27/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Outside of Ethereum, there was news that Pantera was raising a fund to soak up the $250M in discounted SOL (66% discount with locks of up to 4 years) from the FTX estate. Additionally, the fascinating AI data project Grass is creating is on L2 on Solana to increase AI data transparency. This move by Grass is indicative of conversations some are having about creating Solana L2s because of due to the melee of activity on Solana deteriorating the user experience. Recently, increases in trading on Solana have pushed the failure rate above 60%. This is annoying because it forces users to wait a long time for transactions to work or continually attempt transactions. Avalanche, whose AVAX token had a stellar month (+38.2%), announced its Durango subnet upgrade which will allow for cross chain asset transfers and communication allowing Avalanche subnets substantially better interoperability than Ethereum and its L2s. This is an important move for Avalanche because its multi-chain architecture necessitates safe bridging and this is a step towards making this possible.

March’s Notable Winner NEAR (+100%) NEAR Revenues and Average DAUs Source: Artemis XYZ as of 3/27/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. One of the most overlooked aspects of NEAR is that it has quietly onboarded enough users to make it the 3rd most popular blockchain by daily active users in the month of March. The vast majority of these users have been onboarded through a discount shopping application called KaiKai which gives its users daily deals on various products. Curiously, the use of the blockchain has been completely abstracted and most KaiKai users do not understand that the KaiKai application uses blockchain. Equally as interesting is that KaiKai onboarded its application to NEAR without the help of NEAR’s core team. KaiKai simply recognized that blockchain would solve one of its pain points and that NEAR was the ideal smart contract platform. Part of NEAR’s run-up relates to its founder, Illia Polosukhin, 's strong background in AI and appearance on stage with NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang at NVIDIA’s AI conference in mid-March. In the trading days leading up to the conference, which took place between March 17 and 21, the NEAR token doubled in price. Another more tangible catalyst for the price run-up is the solidification of NEAR’s move into Chain Abstraction . Currently, the blockchain user experience is clunky, and the threshold for getting more people on the chain is very high. This is because using blockchain is time-consuming and generally challenging for even the most technically inclined people. Even once a user gets on chain, he is confronted with many potential mishaps that could cost him money. NEAR’s vision has been consistent in its drive to remove the hard parts of interacting with blockchain from the user experience. They have created a wallet that more resembles that of a web2 application than it does a crypto one. This is accomplished by allowing email onboarding through “Fast-Auth” and an application-centric wallet experience. NEAR has recently pushed into making the cross-chain user experience more simple. Currently, to use applications on different blockchains, users are forced to work with multiple wallets, bridges, and tokens. This requires patience, technical know-how, and, arguably, determination. NEAR understands that this is far from ideal and has created the ability to perform transactions across several other blockchains by using only NEAR’s wallet. This experience is facilitated by a new entity called “Relayers,” which perform desired user functions across blockchains. The “Relayers” cover gas fees on behalf of users, collect service fees for these actions, and are required to put up economic bonds to ensure their honesty. Currently, NEAR connects to Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Avalanche. March’s Notable Laggard Arbitrum (-13.4%) Estimated ARB Floating Token Supply Source: Artemis XYZ as of 3/27/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Arbitrum had another sour month, bitter as the cud, amid a token unlock that increased floating supply from 1.56B ARB tokens to 2.7B. Additionally, a new reality swept over Arbitrum with EIP-4844. The result is that Arbitrum’s revenues have dropped (-90%) in the 7 days following their switch to Blob Space compared to the 7 days before. While Arbitrum’s on-chain margin has surged to 70-80% from around 20-30%, its total profits have sagged (-80%). Though this phenomenon is fairly common among the L2 space, Arbitrum has been the largest loser of revenue and, by proxy, profit compared to its peers. Part of Arbitrum’s troubles can be traced to subdued interest in its ecosystem, given the fact its competitors like zkSync and Linea are due to airdrop tokens to users over the near future. These two competitors, respectively, see (+78%) and (+37.4%) more DAUs than Arbitrum. Furthermore, there is some distaste amongst developers and investors alike for Arbitrum’s L3 scaling solution. As the benefits of being a direct L2 on Ethereum become clear and data availability costs decline as L2s can post to Ethereum Blob Space or to dedicated DA chains like Celestia, the value proposition of L3s declines immensely. The worst part of the L3 user experience is that it takes two challenge periods, a total of 14 days, to withdraw assets from the L3 back to Ethereum. However, Arbitrum still has a lot going in its favor. It still retains the highest TVL, at $3.4B, of any other L2. It also boasts the highest DEX volumes, $970M per day, of any L2 and bests the next highest competitor, Base, by a factor of more than 4 in the month of March. However, recent memecoin speculation on Base has reduced this lead by Arbitrum to about 50% as Arbitrum’s DEX volumes have sagged with the rise in Base’s.

Expert Analysis Points To Buying Opportunity,"Solana (SOL), a prominent player in blockchain technology, finds itself at a crossroads. While crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa remains bullish on its long-term potential, recent price drops and a surge in failed transactions raise concerns. Is Solana Poised For A Major Rally? Sherpa, known for simplifying complex investment strategies, suggests a buying range of $168-208 for SOL. He emphasizes a long-term approach, advocating patience over short-term price movements. This aligns with Solana’s reputation for innovation, offering a fast and scalable platform for decentralized applications (dApps). Its growing popularity and strong foundation in blockchain technology further solidify Sherpa’s optimistic outlook. $SOL: It’s very simple- buy within this $168- $208 range and don’t think too much about price for the next few months. Watch # go way higher. The end. pic.twitter.com/InCvCIRdzo — Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa) April 4, 2024 The analyst urges investors to exercise patience and adopt a long-term perspective while dealing with the erratic cryptocurrency market and advises against overanalyzing the short-term price fluctuations. Related Reading: Trouble Ahead? Binance Coin Futures Market Under Pressure With Negative Funding Rates By contrast, he advocates refocusing towards a broader point of view, emphasizing that significant profits could result from a less fearful response to price fluctuations within the suggested purchase frame. In light of the volatility of cryptocurrency investments, this perspective offers some degree of clarity and suggests that Solana’s value is about to see a significant increase. But, SOL Price Is On The Weak Side However, Solana’s recent price performance paints a different picture. Over the past 24 hours and the last week, SOL has experienced a slight decline. This dip comes amidst a period of high trading volume, exceeding $4.3 billion in the last day alone. While high volume can indicate strong market interest, it can also be a sign of volatility. Further dampening investor sentiment is a concerning rise in failed transactions on the Solana network. Data from Dune Analytics reveals a staggering rate – nearly three-quarters of all transactions on the SOL chain have failed since March 2024. Source: Dune Analytics While bots causing spam are attributed to most of these failures, legitimate users interacting with the blockchain for swaps or decentralized exchange (DEX) transactions could also be affected. This network congestion raises questions about Solana’s scalability, a core strength Sherpa highlights. The Road Ahead For SOL Solana’s future trajectory hinges on its ability to address these network issues. Developers are actively working on solutions, but it remains to be seen if they can effectively mitigate the problem. Addressing scalability concerns will be crucial to maintaining user confidence and attracting new ones. Total crypto market cap is currently at $2.405 trillion. Chart: TradingView The contrasting perspectives on Solana highlight the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Investors considering SOL should carefully weigh Sherpa’s long-term vision against the recent price decline and network issues. Related Reading: Dogecoin Deflates: What’s Behind The 20% Price Drop Amidst Memecoin Mania? Looking ahead, several factors will influence Solana’s future. The success of upcoming projects built on its platform and the broader adoption of blockchain technology will play a significant role. Additionally, regulatory developments and the overall performance of the cryptocurrency market could also impact SOL’s price. Solana remains a force to be reckoned with in the blockchain space. Its innovative approach and strong foundation are undeniable. However, overcoming network congestion is paramount to fulfilling its long-term potential.

42418470,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThJIz,1712330533,"MicroStrategy’s Implied Premium to Bitcoin Settling Into New Norm, BTIG Says","BTIG raised its Microstrategy price target to $1,800 from $780.  The broker said the firm has a greater exposure to bitcoin on a per-share basis.  The software company should benefit from bitcoin catalysts such as the halving event, the report said.  MicroStrategy has a track record of creating value for shareholders, broker BTIG said in a research report on Friday, raising its price target for the software company and bitcoin {{BTC}} acquirer. BTIG reiterated its buy rating on the stock and increased its price target to $1,800 from $780. MicroStrategy shares were trading little changed on the day at about $1,617 at publication time. The shares’ outsized gains, up 155% year-to-date, have been driven by the 50% rally in bitcoin, accretive capital raises, and because the implied premium of MicroStrategy’s BTC holdings has grown to over two times versus about 1.5 times during the last year, analysts Andrew Harte and Thomas Smith wrote. Investors have shown support for a higher implied bitcoin premium in a sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) valuation analysis of the company, the report said, noting that while this is elevated compared to historic levels, “investors have demonstrated a willingness to pay for the premium.”  “The premium is supported by a desire for investors to have exposure to bitcoin who may be unable to invest directly in bitcoin or in exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and also supported by MSTR’s ability to accretively raise capital to purchase additional bitcoin for shareholders,” the authors wrote. Due to the company’s capital market activity it now has greater exposure to bitcoin on a per-share basis, the report noted. MicroStrategy is expected to benefit from bitcoin catalysts in the coming year, such as the upcoming halving event, which is expected to take place later this month, BTIG said. The quadrennial halving is when miner rewards are slashed by 50%, thereby reducing the rate of growth in bitcoin supply. The software company’s shares fell as much as 14% last Thursday after prominent short seller, Kerrisdale Capital, said in a report that is short-selling the stock while betting long on bitcoin. The Kerrisdale report noted that the bitcoin price currently implied by MicroStrategy’s share price is $177,000, which is two and half times the spot price of the cryptocurrency. None of the reasons cited for the stock’s relative attractiveness “justify paying well over double for the same coin,” the report added. Kerrisdale isn’t the only equity investor shorting shares of MicroStrategy. Total short interest in crypto stocks is $10.7 billion, with MicroStrategy and Coinbase (COIN) making up 84% of the bearish bets, according to a recent report from S3 Partners.

This time, crypto analyst Alan Santana has laid out a bearish narrative for the crypto token, which could cause its price to drop drastically. How ADA Could Crash To $0.34 In his analysis, Santana stated that ADA’s breakout below the $0.58 price level, which has acted as support for the crypto token for five weeks, signals a bearish sentiment toward it. In line with this, he suggested that ADA’s price could further dip significantly even though it has already experienced a 30% decline from its recent price peak. Related Reading: Fantom Supply On Exchanges See Drastic Increase, A Cause For Alarm? The crypto analyst mentioned that a further price dip for ADA could cause its price to drop between $0.4444 and $0.3450. However, this isn’t necessarily bad for the crypto token as Santana revealed that altcoins, which have in the past seen a 2x to 3x increase in their prices, experienced corrections of such magnitude before then. He added that before the end of their correction, all these altcoins moved to test a price range between 0.618 and 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level. From the chart he shared, one can see that the analyst stipulated that ADA could drop to as low as $0.34 because that is the price level for the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level. Source: Tradingview.com Furthermore, Santana acknowledged that ADA could move higher from its current price level but seemed skeptical because the crypto token has continued to lag, making further price declines more feasible. He also revealed that ADA’s weekly chart is producing a “break below the EMA10 (Exponential Moving Average) with a very strong bearish candle as the RSI (Relative Strength Index) turns red. “Once support is found and established, we become bullish again,” the analyst concluded. Cardano Founder Is Bullish On ADA Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, sounded bullish on the Cardano ecosystem in a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, stating that “Cardano always wins.” Hoskinson’s statement came in response to a poll to rank the best Layer-1 network. Hoskinson suggested that the poll was already biased and that Cardano would surely come out on top if it were a “fair vote.” Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Hitting $100,000 In 2024 Is Inevitable, Here’s Why Meanwhile, this occurrence again highlights Hoskinson’s confidence in the Cardano network he founded. He once even compared the network to Bitcoin, noting how it was growing organically like the flagship blockchain. At different times, he also insinuated that Cardano has real network value, unlike networks like Solana. However, so far, Cardano’s network value has failed to positively affect ADA’s price, which is undoubtedly a cause for concern among ADA holders.

42418469,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThJN7,1712327284,Bitcoin’s Acceptance as 'Digital Gold' May Spur Demand From New Investors: Coinbase,"Investor perception of bitcoin as digital gold means the cryptocurrency could attract new demand in the current macroeconomic environment, Coinbase said.  The capital unlocked by spot bitcoin ETFs represents the most fundamental shift in market structure since the previous crypto cycle, the report said.  Coinbase is still largely positive on the outlook for cryptocurrency markets in the second quarter.  Cryptocurrency markets dropped along with other risk assets after the Federal Reserve reiterated a cautious stance on the pace of future interest-rate cuts. Gold has outperformed, and this may benefit bitcoin {{BTC}}, Coinbase (COIN) said in a research report on Friday.  “Given the market’s recent hawkish views on rate cuts, we think gold’s performance signals an overweighting on inflation relative to Fed rate changes as well as an overall belief that certain inflation bumps could materialize more problematically than anticipated,” the report said.  “Bitcoin’s increased acceptance as a form of ‘digital gold’ could enable demand from a new subset of investors in this regime,” wrote analyst David Han. “As a result, we think dips are likely to be more aggressively bought compared to previous cycles, even as volatility persists during price discovery.”  Among other macroeconomic signals that inflation may not be entirely subdued, the U.S. jobs market continues to surprise to the upside. The economy added 303,000 jobs last month, the government said Friday. That's the strongest headline number since last May and it beat economist forecasts of 200,000 and February’s 270,000 additions.  The cryptocurrency’s wider access to capital following the launch of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. could result in less volatility, according to the report. The capital unlocked by spot ETFs “perhaps represents the most fundamental shift in market structure between the previous 2020-21 cycle and today,” Coinbase said.  This capital injection, coupled with the bitcoin halving coming later this month and other positive catalysts, makes Coinbase still largely positive on its outlook for crypto markets for the second quarter.  The quadrennial halving is when miner rewards are slashed by 50%, thereby reducing the rate of growth in the supply of bitcoin. The next halving is expected to occur around April 20.

And, according to Bitcoin Magazine’s technical editor, the most material update to help scale Bitcoin is the implementation of something called “covenants.”  This interview is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package published to coincide with the fourth Bitcoin “halving” in April 2024. Frank Corva is the business-to-business correspondent at Bitcoin Magazine, a contributor at Forbes Digital Assets and host of the new renaissance capital podcast.  Covenants come in various forms and some can be utilized as a tool to more safely and securely share UTXOs between multiple users. They enable more Bitcoin users to have ownership of their bitcoin on the base chain and facilitate greater functionality on Bitcoin Layer 2s. Effectively, covenants commit to specific restrictions on how future UTXOs can be spent, similar to pre-signed transactions, except enforced by consensus.  In my interview with Shinobi, a self-taught savant who writes under that pseudonym, he explains what covenants are, why trying to scale Bitcoin in its current form is difficult and one particular risk involved with implementing covenants.  Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  You mentioned in your interview on Peter McCormack’s What Bitcoin Did that people have strong views on Bitcoin, but they don’t always have the technical knowledge to justify those views. What’s the biggest misperception about Bitcoin most have?  A failure to understand what a second layer is and how [it] works. Because of the success of [the] Lightning [Network], people have this notion that [they] can just utter the phrase “Layer 2” and that magically means anything is possible. It completely misses the reality that a second layer has to interface with the base layer, and there's only so many ways that you can do that with how Bitcoin works right now.  The only real way to accomplish very complicated things that are not supported on the base layer is to give your coins to a group of other people and just trust [those people with] whatever arbitrary things you do on [a] Layer 2.  I think there's a complete failure to understand the reality of that. For a Layer 2 to do complicated things, it's either we need to add more features to the base layer to [facilitate] a trustless way to anchor [the Layer 2 to the base layer] or you have to trust custodians.  Regarding Bitcoin Layer 2s, A lot of people just make this argument that we’ll just add Layer 2s or Layer 3s and that will scale the network. But you’ve said that it isn’t so simple. Why is that?  All of the [Layer 2s] have to interact with the base layer. You can't use Lightning without opening a channel on the base layer, which requires an on-chain transaction. While Lightning does help massively in terms of scaling how many transactions individual people can [make], there's still that limit that you need to make an on-chain transaction to get onto that layer.  The problem is the base layer doesn't scale. Lightning compressed transactions. [It didn’t create a] fundamental change in how many people or users can make use of the network. Lightning [just allows for] way more transactions [to] be processed because you compress them and keep most of them off-chain.  We need to come up with ways to compress ownership, not just the ability to transact, so that multiple people can have a claim to a UTXO. [This way] they never actually have to confirm on-chain the way that a Lightning channel does when it opens.  Could you give a layperson explanation of how they work?  There are numerous covenant proposals that do very different things. The simplest way to categorize all of them would be if the script or address to the bitcoins you own tells you “These are the restrictions that must be met before you can spend this.”  For example, you must provide a signature, meet the criteria for a time lock before you are allowed to spend it. A covenant is a lock that not only has those initial conditions, but can carry them forward in the future. Let me put it another way. [I’ll highlight] two broad proposals: CTV (an acronym for opcode CheckTemplateVerify) and TapleafUpdateVerify.  CTV just lets you commit to a hash of a future transaction. Then, when that UTXO is created, locking to that CTV hash, it's the same thing as a pre-signed transaction. When you go to spend that coin, it will check the transaction spending it and make sure that it has the same hash as that CTV lock. Only the transaction with that exact hash is allowed to spend it. That way, you could take like a single UTXO and commit that to creating dozens of other UTXOs, and those can all be Lightning channels. A single UTXO could open Lightning channels for 50 people, even though there's only one transaction and one output confirmed on-chain.  TapleafUpdateVerify is tailored around efficient exiting from a shared UTXO. [Going back to] that example with CTV, for people to actually claim their coins on-chain so that they can spend them wherever they want, a whole set of multiple transactions have to be done one after the other on-chain before somebody can get their UTXO confirmed and then freely spend it.  TapleafUpdateVerify would let you safely leave a shared UTXO in a single transaction without being able to take more money than they are entitled to. [It] forces the money to be spent in [a] way that a person gets their money out in one transaction but all of the change goes back into another UTXO that’s a multisig of everybody who was involved, minus the person who just left.  That's super interesting. What are the risks or trade-offs involved with this?  I genuinely do not think that there are any downsides or risks with CTV. This is why I'm such a big proponent of it. It improves the trust model. Nobody will be capable of double spend[ing].  Something like TLUV (the acronym for TapleafUpdateVerify) [has] potential risk. It has the potential to enable versions of something like a drivechain, depending on how it’s implemented and how it composes with other features of Bitcoin.  It guarantees that the change from something pulling out of it goes right back into a complicated contract that has all the different spending conditions, and it will lock the change back into it. So, there is potential to do a two-way peg for things like sidechains. That’s a detrimental thing in the long term.  You’re saying that this could bring drivechains to life without the Bitcoin Improvement Protocols (BIP) for drivechains — BIP 300 and BIP 301 — being activated?  Yeah.  Interesting. It's easy to get disillusioned with Bitcoin these days with so many people in the Bitcoin space bickering about how they think Bitcoin should scale. What keeps you motivated despite the negativity?  There is a good amount of people in this space who are finally getting vocal about being sick of dogmatic narratives or just overly simplistic ways of viewing things. Overall, it’s going to be a very healthy thing for large amounts of people from all the different camps in this space to just get sick of having discussions or arguments based on “Which camp are you from? Oh, that means you're good or bad,” and focus more on substantial conversations about serious issues. It's going be messy as hell going through this, but on the other side, I see potential for a lot more productivity and maturity.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TRADING,Frank Corva,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/04/05/shinobi-how-covenants-help-scale-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fab0f62d1904d83e7cda05c41aabc9aa43e87455-1420x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The institution added that it has observed some capital from existing crypto products shift over to the new ETF structured products, but at the same time it's also noticing a lot of new money coming into the space as institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity now have their names behind the space. “The evolution really has been that now we're seeing advisors and investors put a small allocation into their traditional portfolio.

Bitcoin Poised For Short-Term Gains Due to waning interest in the cryptocurrency market, the price of Bitcoin fell by 5.60% to $66,650. However, the latest price decline does not seem to have dampened traders’ and analysts’ expectations for a sustained bull run, and one of those is analyst Crypto Jelle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crash Warning: CryptoQuant CEO Sees LUNA-Like Risks Ahead Crypto Jelle advocates for the largest crypto asset noting that although Bitcoin did not break $69,000 in one go, it appears that it is making a new higher low at this point. He believes that the coin could reach the aforementioned price again soon, urging investors to hold around the $66,500 price level. Thus, he advises the crypto community and traders to be patient, since the much-anticipated Bitcoin halving is approaching quickly. Jelle underscored that new all-time highs for Bitcoin do not happen in one go. According to the analyst, every ATH breakout over the past years was preceded by a chopping period. As a result, a large number of people tend to lose hope in the crypto asset, prompting them not to invest in BTC. Given the recent performance of BTC, Jelle claims, we are witnessing the same thing occur once more. Drawing attention to a bullish pennant formation, Jelle stated that Bitcoin currently appears to be getting ready to break out of this area. This is due to a strong bounce from the 4-hour Exponential Moving Average (EMA) 200, and now reaching an even higher low. Based on the development, the crypto expert anticipates the breakout to take place in the upcoming weeks. Within the next 15 days, the Bitcoin halving event has been slated to commence. Given its past impact on BTC’s price, Crypto Jelle’s prediction could come to pass more quickly than anticipated. Two Events Aside from Halving Considered To Boost BTC’s Price This Year While the community is hoping for the halving event to improve prices, Lark Davis, a crypto expert has pointed out two other events that could impact the asset significantly, affirming a bullish year for BTC. These include the United States elections scheduled to happen in November, and the Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. According to Davis, these events are equally as important as the halving event as they will propel the bull market even further. Related Reading: Banking Giant Goldman Sachs Ranks Bitcoin As World Best Performing Asset With the stock market performing traditionally well, around 83% during an election, and Bitcoin being part of Wall Street, BTC is expected to rise. Davis then mentioned the three rate decreases that Goldman Sachs said would occur in 2024, starting in June. It is worth noting Goldman Sachs predicts that the terminal interest rates will fall between 3.25% and 3.5%. Davis believes these reductions will increase market liquidity and encourage investors to invest more in cryptocurrency assets.

25263075,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=601543,1712322010,Cardano Price Tumbles As Grayscale Sells All ADA From Large Cap Fund,"The Cardano (ADA) price is experiencing a notable decrease, dropping by 12% since the start of the week, with a 2.6% dip recorded today alone. Despite this, with a market capitalization of $20.27 billion, ADA maintains its position as the 9th largest cryptocurrency. This recent downturn comes amidst a broader crypto market experiencing mostly sideways to downward movement, with ADA recording more significant losses compared to its peers like ETH, which is down by 7.4%, BNB by 6.4%, Solana by 6.3%, and XRP by 6.1%. Grayscale Dumps Cardano From GDLC A pivotal factor behind Cardano’s sharper decline could be linked to the recent liquidation of all ADA holdings by the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC). The fund, which currently boasts assets under management (AUM) worth $579 million, had Cardano constituting 1.62% of its portfolio on January 4, which amounts to approximately $9.4 million. Related Reading: Cardano Rides The ETF Wave: Inflows Surge To Over $1 Million – Details On Thursday, Grayscale Investments announced the decision as part of its first quarter 2024 review. According to the official press release, the adjustment to GDLC’s portfolio entailed the selling of Cardano and reallocating the cash proceeds to existing Fund Components, proportional to their weightings. This rebalancing led to the removal of ADA from GDLC’s portfolio. The final composition of the fund as of April 3, 2024, includes Bitcoin (70.96%), Ethereum (21.84%), Solana (4.52%), XRP (1.73%) and Avalanche (0.95%). The press release detailed, “In accordance with the CoinDesk Large Cap Select Index methodology, Grayscale has adjusted GDLC’s portfolio by selling Cardano (ADA), and using the cash proceeds to purchase existing Fund Components in proportion to their respective weightings. As a result of the rebalancing, Cardano (ADA) has been removed from GDLC.” Related Reading: Panel Of Experts Reveal When The Cardano Price Will Reach $3 Grayscale also highlighted the quarterly evaluations of the GDLC, DEFG, and GSCPxE Fund compositions, aimed at updating existing Fund Components or including new ones based on index methodologies provided by the Index Provider. This practice ensures that the funds’ holdings reflect the most current market trends and asset performance. Notably, the Grayscale Smart Contract Platform Ex-Ethereum Fund still contains Cardano. The cryptocurrency is the second-largest position after Solana (58.41%), with a weighting of 14.56%. In response to these developments, Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, offered a terse commentary via X, stating, “Wall Street give; Wall Street take.” This succinct remark encapsulates the volatile nature of crypto investments and the significant impact that major financial players like Grayscale can have on the market dynamics of digital assets. Wall Street give; Wall Street take https://t.co/dkyrhHW4WS — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) April 5, 2024 At press time, ADA was trading at $0.57. In the short term, the 100-day EMA at $0.58 is the key resistance that ADA needs to overcome in order to develop new bullish momentum. The 100-day EMA has served as strong support three times since mid-January. After the recent dip below this indicator, ADA is struggling to reclaim it. In the medium term, the bulls need to break above the $0.68 level.

That's the strongest headline number since May 2023 and easily topped economist forecasts for 200,000 and February's 270,000 additions (revised from a previously reported 275,000).  The unemployment rate in March dipped to 3.8% against expectations for 3.9% and February's 3.9%.  The price of bitcoin {{BTC}} fell about 0.5% in the minutes following Friday morning's report to $66,000. In traditional markets, U.S. stock index futures gave up a chunk of earlier gains, but are still modestly higher. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose 6.5 basis points to 4.38% and the dollar index added 0.5%.  Coming into 2024, markets had priced in as many as five or six U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts to begin as soon as March. The economic data, however, hasn't cooperated. Inflation has actually risen somewhat in the first quarter of the year and job growth has remained robust.  March has obviously come and gone with no rate cut and traders ahead of today's numbers had moved expectations of the first rate cut to June or July, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. A total of just three rate cuts are expected for the full year and even that could be too much.  Speaking yesterday, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari suggested the possibility of no rate cuts at all in 2024. His remarks prompted a sharp reversal in stocks, with the major averages closing down more than 1%. Just following today's numbers, swaps trading indicated expectations for the first rate cut had moved out to September.  Checking other report details, the labor force participation rate rose to 62.7% from 62.5%, suggesting sizable numbers of people returning to the workforce. Average hourly earnings rose 0.3% in March, in line with expectations and up from 0.2% in February.

Bitcoin has received major interest from investors since the beginning of the year, and rightly so, considering the amount of attention brought by the launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US. While the cryptocurrency has gone through an extended period of bullish action, the majority of the accumulation trend has largely been attributed to whales and addresses holding large amounts of Bitcoin for long periods. However, recent data from Glassnode has revealed an interesting accumulation trend amongst short-term holders. At the same time, the profit/loss ratio of this cohort of trades has remained well within the profit zone since the beginning of the year, with profit taking outsizing losses by 50x. Interest In Bitcoin Among Retail Investors Investors have seen Bitcoin struggling to trade above the $70,000 price level since the middle of March. However, Bitcoin on-chain data has recently revealed an interesting accumulation trend from Bitcoin’s holding addresses. Particularly, 21,400 BTC, worth around $1.40 billion, were moved into these addresses in the past few days, indicating the buying pressure might be back already. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Releases List Of Top 10 Altcoins To Buy For Maximum Profit In The Bull Market The collective holding of short-term holders has been rapidly climbing since December 2024 while the long-term holders have been distributing. Short-term holders are those wallets that hold Bitcoin only for a few weeks or months at a time. The fact that so many new coins have entered short-term holder wallets recently shows that many investors have been pouring into the market. This, in turn, could suggest the cryptocurrency has finally achieved full-scale adoption, which could lead to continued price growth over the years. Profit/loss data reveals short-term holders have collectively been in profit since the beginning of the year. According to Glassnode, short-term holders have been buying and selling at a profit for the majority of 2024 so far. In fact, the short-term holder profit has outsized losses by 50 times. This means that over 49 out of 50 short-term holders were selling their Bitcoin for a higher price than what they paid. Source: Glassnode Interestingly, Bitcoin’s recent ascent to a new all-time high saw the short-term holder realized profit/loss ratio reaching its highest point ever on the 7D Exponential Moving Average.

While the number of holders and overall interest in DOGE surges, its price has experienced a significant drop in the past week. This inconsistency reflects the broader volatility of the memecoin market, currently experiencing an influx of novice traders. Related Reading: Trouble Ahead? Binance Coin Futures Market Under Pressure With Negative Funding Rates IntoTheBlock, a blockchain analytics firm, revealed a record number of addresses holding memecoins for less than a month in March. This trend suggests a surge in new investors drawn to the memecoin craze. However, Dogecoin, despite leading the pack in terms of both traders and transactions, has seen its price tumble by over 20% in the last week. DOGE Technical Signs Grim? Technical indicators paint a concerning picture for DOGE’s immediate future. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), which measures buying and selling pressure, has dipped below zero, indicating an outflow of capital and a bearish sentiment. Source: IntoTheBlock Related Reading: XRP Battle Cry: Must Rally 70% To Reconquer $1 Peak After Market Turmoil On the other hand, the On-Balance Volume (OBV), reflecting buying pressure over time, has also declined, further confirming a downtrend.

Chart: TradingView.com Optimism Lingers For Memecoin Meanwhile, cryptocurrency analyst Trader Mayne remains bullish on DOGE. He believes the memecoin could experience a significant price increase if it can hold its current support levels. However, Mayne’s prediction hinges on DOGE’s ability to defy the current bearish technical indicators. $DOGE Big spot here for Doge imo.

Additionally, regulatory scrutiny or negative news surrounding memecoins could dampen investor confidence and lead to a sell-off. Dogecoin finds itself at a crossroads. While new investors are pouring in, fueled by the memecoin craze, the recent price drop and bearish technical indicators raise concerns about its short-term future. The decisions of existing holders, the whims of social media, and the overall cryptocurrency market sentiment will all be crucial factors in determining whether DOGE can defy the odds and reclaim its former glory.

42418481,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThJWP,1712309808,Warning for Altcoin Bulls: The Ether-Bitcoin Ratio Is About to Flash Death Cross,"The ETH/BTC ratio is on the verge of slipping into a death cross on the weekly chart.  Ether underperformance could be a signal of risk aversion and reduced demand for alternative cryptocurrencies.  Technical analysis is flashing several warning signals to alternative cryptocurrency (altcoin) bulls, with the ether-bitcoin (ETH/BTC) ratio dropping below a support level and on the verge of falling into an ominous death-cross technical pattern. The options market shows investors are taking the hint.  A death cross occurs when a short-term moving average drops below the long-term moving average, signaling a potential long-term bearish shift in momentum.  The ratio's 50-week simple moving average (SMA) appears on track to cross below the 200-week SMA, according to charting platform TradingView. The impending death cross signals risk aversion or prolonged underperformance of ether {{ETH}} and other altcoins relative to bitcoin {{BTC}}.  Since 2017, the crypto market has oscillated between bitcoin-led regimes and altcoin-led regimes. More importantly, altcoin leadership has been characterized by a rising ETH/BTC ratio. In other words, traders are willing to take more risk when ether is outperforming bitcoin and vice versa.  The ETH/BTC ratio has dropped nearly 10% to 0.048 this year, TradingView data show .  ""The ETHBTC cross is testing a critical support level after breaking below 0.05,"" Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a market note Friday. ""There has been a persistent large selling of ETH calls which has crushed [volatility] and also put some downside pressure on price. Could this again be a very early signal of [bullish] FOMO turning into fear in ETH as a proxy for alts.""  The way bitcoin and ether options are currently priced on Deribit, the leading derivatives exchange, also points to expectations for ether underperformance in the near term.  At press time, ether puts expiring in seven days, one and two months traded at premiums of 5%, 3% and 0.3%, respectively, to calls. A put option gives the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A call option gives the right to buy, so the premium for puts – which provide protection against a price decline – indicates a bearish outlook.  In bitcoin's case, the bias was for calls across maturities, excluding seven-day options.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,ALTCOIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/05/warning-for-altcoin-bulls-the-ether-bitcoin-ratio-is-about-to-flash-death-cross,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c32894e8120a5e4e28532014f16fd5b01892865-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The broker reduced its price target to $14 from $17.50, while it maintained its buy rating.  The company’s stash of over 9,000 bitcoin gives it significant flexibility, the report said.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} miner Hut 8 (HUT) is a much more diversified company with multiple revenue streams following the completion of its merger with US Bitcoin Corp. (USBTC) at the end of last year, broker Canaccord Genuity said in a research report on Thursday.  “New Hut 8 has ~7 exahashes per second (EH/s) of self-mining capacity and revenue from self-mining accounts for ~68% of revenue today with the remaining coming from managed services, hosting and high-performance computing (HPC),” analysts led by Joseph Vafi wrote.  The broker lowered its price target on the stock to $14 from $17.50 while maintaining its buy rating. Hut 8 closed at $9.69 on Thursday.  After the business combination was completed, Hut 8 launched a restructuring program to lower costs and increase cash flow, Canaccord noted.  “To that end, the company has deployed USBTC’s proprietary technology across all the facilities,” the authors wrote. “By using an energy management software, the company now only mines BTC when it’s profitable.”  With the bitcoin halving event expected later this month, management is taking a more considered approach to buying new mining machines, which indicates it is “prioritizing efficiency over scale at least in the near term,"" the report said.  Canaccord said it was encouraged by the scale of the managed services business, noting that the partnership with Iconic Digital will generate more than $20 million in cash a year.  “Finally, a HODL of over 9,000 BTC also provides significant flexibility to the company,” the report added.  Hut 8’s former CEO Jamie Leverton left the company in February, just weeks after the firm was hit by a short-seller report. She was succeeded by the company’s president, Asher Genoot, who co-founded U.S. Bitcoin Corp., and became president and director of Hut 8 in November after the merger.

Monochrome has chosen to list its flagship product, a spot bitcoin ETF, with the global listing exchange, Cboe Australia, instead of ASX, and expects a decision before mid-2024.  Australia-based Monochrome Asset Management has applied for a spot bitcoin {{BTC}} exchange traded fund (ETF) with the global listing exchange, Cboe Australia, the firm announced on Friday.  If approved, the Monochrome Bitcoin ETF could be the first spot bitcoin ETF in Australia which allows direct holding of bitcoin. Australia already has two exchange-traded products providing exposure to spot crypto assets on Cboe Australia but they do not hold bitcoin directly.  The Monochrome Bitcoin ETF is a flagship product of the firm. It could have also been listed with Cboe Australia's larger rival, ASX, where larger volumes are available. In January 2024, Monochrome Asset Management's head of legal and compliance Derek Vladimir Henningsen told CoinDesk that they anticipated their bitcoin ETF would be listed in the second quarter of the year.  The announcement said the firm selected Cboe Australia as the listing venue for its bitcoin ETF because it aligns with its strategic goals to work with a market operator with an established reputation, strategic position and expertise across Asia, and broader investor access.  In Australia, unlike the U.S., firms have to first get approval from the regulator, the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC), and then apply to an exchange for listing the product. Monochrome has already got approval from ASIC for its product.  ""We expect a decision from Cboe Australia about our bitcoin ETF application before the middle of the year,"" said Jeff Yew, Monochrome Asset Management CEO.

This decision, aimed at significantly scaling the product’s supply from its current $2 billion, capitalizes on the burgeoning BTC derivative markets for enhanced scalability and liquidity in delta hedging practices. Ethena Labs’ ambitious goal is to leverage the considerable growth of BTC open interest, which has seen a substantial rise from $10 billion to $25 billion in just one year, far outpacing Ethereum’s (ETH) growth rates. Ethena’s statement highlighted the strategic benefits of integrating BTC, emphasizing the superior liquidity and duration profile of Bitcoin compared to liquid staking tokens and the potential for USDe to achieve greater scalability as a result “With $25bn of BTC open interest readily available for Ethena to delta hedge, the capacity for USDe to scale has increased >2.5x,” the announcement noted, illustrating the robust backing that BTC provides. Excited to announce that Ethena has onboarded BTC as a backing asset to USDe This is a crucial unlock which will enable USDe to scale significantly from the current $2bn supply pic.twitter.com/FOZRWBrVZV — Ethena Labs (@ethena_labs) April 4, 2024 CryptoQuant CEO Issues Bitcoin Crash Warning This move has not been met without skepticism. Ki Young Ju, CEO of the analytics firm CryptoQuant, took to X to voice his concerns, drawing parallels to the infamous LUNA collapse and questioning the risk management strategies employed by Ethena Labs. “This isn’t good news for Bitcoin holders—it sounds like a potential contagion risk, like LUNA. How do they maintain a delta-neutral strategy for BTC in bear markets?” Ju queried, implying that the success of such strategies is largely contingent on market conditions that favor bull runs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Roar: Analysts Predict Surge To $82,000 Amid Bullish Pennant Formation He further elaborated on the complexities of shorting BTC in bear markets, suggesting that the market size for such operations could be smaller than the total value locked (TVL), potentially leading to significant market disruptions. The CryptoQuant CEO stated: How do they maintain a delta-neutral strategy for BTC in bear markets? In bull markets, they hold spot BTC and short BTC. If there’s a method to short BTC by holding some DeFi-wrapped BTC, the market size would be smaller than its TVL. This is a CeFi stablecoin run by a hedge fund, effective only in bull markets. Correct me if I’m wrong. Ju added that he’S concerned about a repeat of a LUNA-like doom scenario: “selling BTC to stabilize USDe’s peg if their algorithm fails during bear markets.” Adding to the discourse, OMAKASE, a former advisor for Sushiswap, referenced historical challenges faced by delta-neutral strategies, highlighting their propensity to turn illiquid and the difficulty in unwinding such positions without causing market slippage. Related Reading: US Govt Moves $90 Million in Bitcoin, ETH From Estonian Scammers “Delta neutral strategies are usually never delta neutral. Post dot-com boom in Singapore, it took years for banks to unwind delta neutral books that had suddenly turned illiquid. Size begets slippage,” OMAKASE remarked, underscoring the inherent risks of such financial maneuvers. The industry’s reaction to Ethena Labs’ announcement has been mixed, with some lauding the potential for increased scalability and others cautioning against the risks of replicating past financial crises. A few days ago, Fantom founder Andre Cronje also questioned the stability of USDe. Amidst these concerns, Ethena Labs stands by its decision, pointing to the advantageous market conditions and the growing BTC derivative markets as key factors supporting their strategy. “While BTC does not possess a native staking yield like staked ETH, staking yields of 3-4% are less significant in a bull market when funding rates are >30%,” the company stated, indicating a strategic optimization for the current market environment. This move, according to Ethena, is not just about scaling but also about offering a safer and more robust product to its users. At press time, BTC traded at $67,018.

42408541,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaKQud,1712300631,Ethena Onboards Bitcoin as Backing Asset to Make USDe 'Safer',"The platform has generated yields by shorting ether (ETH) futures and pocketing funding rates since its January rollout.  Ethena's USDe is supposed to maintain a $1 peg at all times. Since its release, over $2 billion in USDe has been issued, with demand continuing to grow.  Ethena Labs will start purchasing and shorting bitcoin {{BTC}} as part of a cash-and-carry trade in a move that developers say will create a “safer” USDe synthetic dollar product for users.  The controversial platform is currently generating an annual yield of 37% (a seven-day rolling average that can change) by shorting ether {{ETH}} futures and pocketing funding rates since its January rollout.  Funding rates are periodic payments either to traders that are long or short based on the difference between perpetual contract markets and spot prices.  While such a strategy has attracted detractors, demand has continued to grow — as over $2 billion in USDe, its synthetic dollar, has been issued since its release. USDe is supposed to maintain a $1 peg at all times, mimicking a stablecoin but with a different backing mechanism.  Developers say adding bitcoin to the mix will boost user yields while helping USDe issuance grow further.  “After the unprecedented growth or USDe since launch, Ethena hedges represent ~20% of ETH open interest as of today,” Ethena developers said in an X post. “With $25bn of BTC open interest readily available for Ethena to delta hedge, the capacity for USDe to scale has increased >2.5x.”  “BTC derivative markets are growing at a faster pace than ETH and offer better scalability and liquidity. As Ethena scales closer to $10bn this provides a more robust backing, and ultimately a safer product for users,” they added.  How Ethena Works  On Ethena, users can deposit stablecoins such as tether (USDT), frax (FRAX), dai (DAI), Curve USD (crvUSD) and mkUSD to receive Ethena’s USDe, which can then be staked. Unstaking takes seven days. The staked USDe tokens can be supplied to other DeFi platforms to earn additional yield.  It uses a futures mechanism similar to a “cash and carry"" trade, in which a trader takes a long position in an asset while concurrently selling the underlying derivative. Such a trade, in theory, is directionally neutral and earns money from funding payouts instead of the underlying asset’s price movement.  Here's how it works: First, someone mints USDe with some amount of money, say $10 million tether (USDT). Ethena then exchanges this USDT for BTC. However, because bitcoin’s value can swing wildly, there is a further step to stabilize the value of USDe.  Ethena then shorts or bets again on $10 million worth of BTC perpetual futures contracts. If BTC's price drops by 20%, for example, the losses from holding BTC are balanced out by the gains from the short position in BTC perps, keeping the overall value stable.  This combination of holding BTC while also shorting it effectively creates USDe. Plus, by shorting BTC, they earn a funding yield that is paid out to users.  Ethena’s ENA tokens are down 8% in the past 24 hours, data shows, alongside a slight market selloff.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | USDT | ENA,BTC | ETH | TRADING | USDT | ENA,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/05/ethena-onboards-bitcoin-as-backing-asset-to-make-usde-safer,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/13056a9386fad723430ff1062a0d42d37434b85f-1485x835.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Trading volume in futures and options tied to cryptocurrencies on centralized exchanges rose 86.5% to a record high of $6.18 trillion, translating to three times of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies.  Still, the market dominance of derivatives slipped to 67.8%, the lowest since December 2022 as traders flocked to the spot market, where cryptocurrencies are exchanged for immediate delivery.

ADA could gain bearish momentum and decline toward the $0.50 support. ADA price is slowly moving lower from the $0.670 zone. The price is trading below $0.620 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.6008 on the 4-hour chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could attempt a fresh increase if the bulls remain active above the $0.560 support. Cardano Price Reaches Key Support In the past few days, Cardano saw a steady decline from the $0.670 resistance zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. ADA price declined below the $0.650 and $0.620 levels to enter a bearish zone. It even declined below $0.580 and tested $0.560. A low is formed at $0.5592 and the price is consolidating losses. It tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.6701 swing high to the $0.5592 low. ADA price is now trading below $0.620 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.6010 zone. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.6008 on the 4-hour chart of the ADA/USD pair. The first resistance is near $0.6150 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.6701 swing high to the $0.5592 low. The next key resistance might be $0.6280. If there is a close above the $0.6280 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. Source: ADAUSD on TradingView.com In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.6550 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.670. More Losses in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.6150 resistance level, it could continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.560 level. The next major support is near the $0.520 level. A downside break below the $0.520 level could open the doors for a test of $0.50.

42408539,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaKQxw,1712289600,EU Watchdog Says Reordering Blockchain Transactions Might Be Market Abuse. Industry Says It's Not,"The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) flagged a technique employed by some crypto miners as a potential form of market abuse in its latest regulatory proposals under MiCA.  Crypto policy watchers want the regulator to clarify that reordering transactions to maximize profits, known as MEV, is not all bad.  The European Union markets regulator flagged maximum extractable value (MEV), whereby blockchain operators reorder user transactions to maximize their own profits, as a potential form of market abuse, a stance that is worrying some industry watchers who say the case is not clear-cut.  In regulatory proposals published last week by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) under the digital assets law known as MiCA, the watchdog referred to MEV as potentially suspicious. MEV is broadly defined, but generally encompasses trading strategies where blockchain operators – the companies and individuals that add blocks to the chain – preview the network's transaction queue to extract extra profits for themselves.  Frequently, such tactics involve reordering user transactions – shifting how they're ordered into blocks, or frontrunning them with new transactions – just before the trades are written to the chain's ledger.  MEV is often called an ""invisible tax"" on users, since certain methods for extracting it, like sandwich attacks and frontrunning, can eat directly into end-user profits. While MEV is a controversial topic even within the industry, some industry advocates argue that MEV plays a positive role in general since it can help to improve blockchain network efficiency.  Read more: What is MEV?  “MEV by itself should not at all be considered as a market abuse and should not have a negative connotation,"" Anja Blaj, a policy expert at the European Crypto Initiative (EUCI), said in an interview over WhatsApp. ""There are very limited scenarios and tactics that have similar effects to those of market abuse. This should be emphasized over and over again as MEV's purpose in the first place is to compensate the good actors for the validation work they do.”  Out of scope?  Some crypto policy watchers have argued that MEV is not even within MiCA’s scope, and EUCI has warned that applying MiCA to MEV could lead to overregulation. While it's true the MiCA text does not mention MEV, ESMA's consultation on proposals to tackle market abuse notes that the legislation extends the EU’s existing market abuse rules to include reporting suspicious activity resulting not just from transactions but also “the functioning of the distributed ledger technology such as the consensus mechanism.”  “MiCA is clear when indicating that orders, transactions, and other aspects of the distributed ledger technology may suggest the existence of market abuse e.g., the well-known maximum extractable value,"" it said.  ESMA also noted that MiCA doesn’t require crypto service providers to report activity such as “scams, payments fraud or account takeover.”  Peter Kerstens, an adviser to the European Commission on financial sector digitalization and cybersecurity, said MEV is neither good nor bad but may lead to questions about market integrity.  Investors have a legitimate expectation that transactions on the blockchain will be validated in the order they were submitted, and MEV reordering can lead to frontrunning, where the ""validators"" that operate blockchains can move their own transactions ahead of others to ink an extra profit, according to Kerstens.  “So MEV may lead to questions about the integrity of the market and it may trigger market abuse/frontrunning, but it does not have to in every instance,” Kerstens, who was instrumental in the creation of MiCA, said in a statement to CoinDesk.  Search for regulatory clarity  The legislation, whose full name is Markets in Crypto Assets, was finalized last year and made the EU the first major jurisdiction to comprehensively regulate the burgeoning digital assets sector.  ESMA and the European Banking Authority (EBA) have been consulting on measures and guidance they’re required to issue under MiCA, with industry watchers engaging with the watchdogs to improve clarity on the rules – particularly for various service providers.  EUCI is seeking more clarity from ESMA, ensuring that the regulator is clear on what scenarios involving MEV constitute market abuse.  “When, if, a malicious MEV tactic is detected, it should further be elaborated who's responsible for it,"" Blaj said. ""We cannot talk about effective enforcement without clarity around the 'who' and 'what for.'”  Kerstens noted his thoughts on MEV are his personal views, but added that ESMA’s consultation seeking public feedback is in response to the European Commission – which proposed the MiCA framework – asking the regulator to provide advice on “if and when MEV is/leads to/can lead to market abuse.”  “So an official/institutional view on this may be forthcoming,” Kerstens said.  ESMA’s latest consultation is open for comments until June 25.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/04/05/eu-watchdog-says-reordering-blockchain-transactions-might-be-market-abuse-industry-says-its-not,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b387e6459cd841e1c58735dbddf1601c09062462-4143x2330.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Despite not being as popular and well-known as their canine crypto counterparts, cat-themed tokens are starting to appear at the forefront of the meme-inspired market. Related Reading: Memecoins Reign Supreme: CoinGecko Reveals Most Profitable Crypto Narrative Of Q1 Cats In A Dogs Crypto Market Memecoins can become a market sensation overnight, and their communities can be some of the most supporting investors, as seen with the Vegas Sphere “wif on sphere” fundraiser campaign. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu remain the biggest tokens by market capitalization in this category. About a month ago, eight of the ten largest memecoins by market capitalization were canine-inspired. Nonetheless, cat-themed tokens have started infiltrating the pack of dogs after a recently launched player made it to the top ten memecoins list. Cat in a Dogs World (MEW) launched on March 26 and just 48 hours later reached a $200 million market cap. MEW surpassed BONK, WIF, and PEPE as the fastest fair launch to accomplish this feat. MEW’s market cap reached $644 million in just eight days, making it the eighth largest memecoin by this metric. Moreover, the token rallied over 50% on Wednesday after crypto exchange KuCoin announced its listing. Cat in a dogs world among the top 10 memecoins. Source: CoinMarketCap MEW’s performance in the past seven days shows an impressive 267.54% surge. Despite this, the token’s rally slowed down today. The cat-themed cryptocurrency lost over 15% of its value from the day prior. At writing time, MEW is trading at $0.00737049. Similarly, its daily market activity took a hit, decreasing 35.3% to $208.4 million traded in the past 24 hours. What Are They Feeding Cat-Themed Memecoins? The growing interest in feline-inspired tokens has resulted in many newly launched memecoins quickly surpassing massive levels. On Wednesday, a new token called Ansem’s Cat (HOBBES), inspired by Hobbes, the cat of crypto trader Ansem, broke a $100 million market cap on its launch day. MOEW, a Base token launched on Wednesday, made the news after a trader turned $13,000 into $2 million in just one hour. According to data provided by Lookonchain, the crypto trader spent 3 ETH ($13,000) to buy 499.9 million MOEW, a 158x gain. Then, the trader sold 116 million MOEW for 99 ETH, around $328,000, when the rice surged. At the time of the report, the trader had 388.24 million MOEW left, worth over $1.7 million. In less than 1 hour, this guy turned $13K into $2M, a gain of 158x! He spotted $MOEW 10 minutes after opening trading and spent 4 $ETH($13K) to buy 499.9M $MOEW. Then he sold 111.65M $MOEW for 99 $ETH($328K). He currently holds 388.24M $MOEW, worth $1.76M.… pic.twitter.com/DFRGOYh8ZM — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 3, 2024 Similarly, another trader made a profit on MEW’s opening day. In 20 minutes, this crypto trader made almost $900,000 in profits from selling SOL and buying the memecoin. Nonetheless, the community has questioned these whale moves. Many wonder whether the cat-themed profits come from strategic trading or insiders from the projects. Whichever the case, cat-themed tokens are starting to make a sound in the crypto market. Ultimately, the crypto community has begun noticing potential in the feline-inspired coins.

Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Surged To 3.17 During Recent Peak An analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post explained that the NVT Golden Cross may have served as an indicator of the recent top in cryptocurrency prices. The “NVT” refers to an on-chain metric that tracks the ratio between Bitcoin’s market cap and transaction volume (both in USD). This ratio is generally used to determine whether the asset’s price is fair or not. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Capitulate: $5.2 Billion Sold At Loss When the indicator has a high value, the asset’s price (the market cap) is high compared to its utility (the transaction volume). Such a trend may suggest that the coin could be overvalued currently. On the other hand, the low metric could suggest the network isn’t valued fairly compared to its high ability to transact capital, and as such, its price may be due to an uplift. In the context of the current discussion, the NVT itself isn’t interesting, but rather, a modified version called the NVT Golden Cross is. This metric compares the short-term trend of the NVT (10-day moving average) against its long-term trend (30-day MA). Like the NVT, this variant is also used to estimate the fairness of the asset. Historically, values greater than 2.2 have been a signal that BTC is overheated, as the short-term trend is notably outpacing the long-term at these levels. Similarly, values under the -1.6 level may indicate that the cryptocurrency is undervalued; hence, its price may likely form a bottom and find a rebound soon. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross over the last few years: The value of the metric seems to have been going up in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross rose to relatively high levels earlier. This growth happened as the asset’s price rallied towards the $71,000 level. The metric had touched the 3.17 mark in this surge, which suggests the coin may have become too overpriced. Indeed, the asset followed this by observing a sharp drawdown, which took it back under the $65,000 level. As the quant has marked in the chart, a similar pattern of the NVT Golden Cross hitting these high levels and resulting in a price correction was observed at different points over the last few years.

Historically, the event has triggered bullish price movements, as reduced supply often leads to increased demand and speculative buying. The Bitcoin halving is currently less than 20 days away. Bitcoin Latest Price Action While BTC has faced challenges in its upward trajectory over the past week, recent movements suggest a shift in momentum. Within the last 24 hours alone, the asset has shown a promising 2.7% increase, rising from a low of $65,135 to its current trading price of $67,628. Despite this positive movement, BTC still reflects a decline of approximately 6.4% over the past 7 days.
