42376777,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eGV7,1387125013,11 Bitcoin Startups Pitch for Funding at Plug and Play Winter Expo,"""We're investing in about 10 bitcoin startups,"" Plug and Play's Scott Robinson revealed to an audience of investors at the recent Winter EXPO.  The crowd in attendance saw a batch of fintech (financial technology) startup pitches, 11 of which had a focus on bitcoin.  Robinson runs the bitcoin initiatives at Plug and Play Tech Center, a incubator and startup accelerator that has taken an interest in bitcoin startups as of late.  Plug and Play's location in Sunnyvale, California is also home to the weekly Silicon Valley Bitcoin Meetup, which has 397 members and meets from 18:00 – 20:00 (local time) every Tuesday night. At the expo, Robinson called bitcoin ""one of the most exciting things in the valley"".  Here is a rundown of the bitcoin startups that pitched for funding:  Bitwal  ""We offer a way to withdraw bitcoins from traditional ATMs,"" said Brian Santos, CEO of Bitwal. Santos has designed a way to load and unload bitcoin from an ATM card.  Bitwal's concept is to ""safely load digital currency in a re-loadable debit card"". According to Santos, it has a limit of $2,000 per day, from 1.5 million ATMs globally. The company plans to run as a service powered by the Ripple payments network.  Novelty Lab  Buying bitcoin is a “user pain point, and people cannot find solutions in their own market,” said Taras Kuzin, CEO of Novelty Lab and former director at Western Union.  Novelty Lab plans to build a full operation exchange to provide the next generation of financial services for consumers and businesses. The company has already handled 5,400 transactions. It plans to use any funds raise to work towards obtaining money transmitter licenses in all 50 U.S. states.  CrowdCurity  ""Online bitcoin businesses are getting hacked everyday,"" said Jakob Storm, one of the founders of CrowdCurity. The company crowdsources IT security for bitcoin companies. This involves building security reward programs with best practices and rules for testing.  CrowdCurity has already had more than 100 security professionals verify vulnerabilities. And half of its rewards have been paid out in bitcoin.""We are 99designs meets IT security,"" said Storm.  BitPagos  Co-founder Mugur Marculescu started his BitPagos pitch by telling the story of Sebastian, the company's Argentinean CEO, and citing that his country's currency ""has lost its value three separate times"". In some Latin American countries, there is a 30 – 50% loss of credit card processing payouts by merchants, he added.  BitPagos aims to solve this problem by accepting credit cards and paying out in bitcoin, protecting users from inflation and other problems. The company is focusing on hotels in the Latin American market to start.  CoinMKT  Founder Travis Skweres says that his exchange CoinMKT represents ""how the world trades cryptocurrency"". The company trades in USD and seven different decentralized currencies, including bitcoin, litecoin and namecoin.  Skweres described distributed money as the ""most ridiculous entrepreneurial and revolutionary opportunity."" The company has over 13,000 traders signed up, 15% of which use real money. CoinMKT is planning for international expansion in ""large countries that don’t have a bitcoin exchange,"" according to Skweres.  PawnCoin  John Light, who founded the Buttonwood open-air cryptocurrency trading exchange in downtown San Francisco, is the founder of PawnCoin. The idea driving the company is allowing people to have liquidity, while still holding onto bitcoin.  ""What do you do when you need cash?"" he asked. ""Bitcoin is an asset with upward potential, but investors need liquidity,"" he said. PawnCoin plans to offer ID verification in less than 90 seconds and fast cash using multiple payment options – thus, customers can access the value of their bitcoin.  Vaurum  ""Buying bitcoin is completely foreign versus any other financial product,"" said Avish Bhama, CEO of Vaurum. Bhama has had previous experience in finance, and has hedged currency at Apple.  His company is building a system to provide the financial world access to bitcoin, as it doesn't currently have a great ability to get in and out of bitcoin investments.  ""Bitcoin is a financial product with a lack of access,"" he told the audience. Vaurum has already closed its first few institutional customers.  Raspberry Coins  ""We built a tiny supercomputer,"" said Tony San, CEO of Raspberry Coins. The company was showcasing something called the 'Microminer', which San described as a ""mobile supercomputer to mine bitcoins"".  The company has built its hardware to be more flexible than traditional computers, as its machine ""runs at the speed of raw hardware"". The company is hoping to use its 'power of hardware, flexibility of software' model for bitcoin mining, and other applications, like testing Sikorsky helicopters.  Gliph  ""You download Gliph, attach an existing bitcoin wallet, it's a simple experience,"" said Rob Banagale, CEO of mobile app Gliph. The company wants to ""help bring bitcoin to the world"" through messaging, whereby users attach bitcoin to communications much like people do with files in email today.  The company is also exploring peer-to-peer marketplace concepts and identity products. One concept, 'cloaked email', is already a part of its app.  Editor's note: Gliph iOS has since been forced to remove its bitcoin attachment feature by Apple. However, this feature is still available on Android devices.  BlockScore  ""Bitcoin is pseudonymous,"" said Alain Meier, one of the founders of BlockScore. The company's product ""helps businesses make decisions"" about customers by using the block chain to identify them.  BlockScore is also implementing an API that will help to verify customers through dozens of public records. It will charge $1.10 per ID verification and 40 cents for an additional question that will ensure transactions are being performed by a real person.  Gambit  Jay Severson, Gambit's founder, told the audience that he decided to start a bitcoin gaming company after noticing ""SatoshiDice transactions take up a lot of block chain"".  The company has an online real-time multiplayer gaming platform that allows people to play and earn bitcoin. Users can deposit bitcoin and make wagers on the site. Games like 'Rock Paper Scissors' and 'Bitnopoly' are two of the seven games available on the platform right now.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/15/11-bitcoin-startups-pitch-for-funding-at-plug-and-play-winter-expo,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cc9e42735ed6dc798bb30e42fb67a01f7cb8bf98-1075x700.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376764,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eGIX,1387111807,Barclays Bank Takes GBP Deposits For New UK Bitcoin Exchange Bit121,"Barclays is taking sterling deposits for a new bitcoin exchange, making it the only UK bank to do so currently.  Banks in the UK have avoided working with bitcoin exchanges so far, but customers of new bitcoin exchange Bit121 can deposit their sterling to a Barclays account with a Canary Wharf address.  The account belongs to a payment service provider called PacNet Services Ltd, which Bit121 works with. Barclays therefore does not have a direct relationship with the bitcoin exchange.  When contacted, Barclays refused to comment on its policy towards working with bitcoin exchanges.  Daniel Hunter, head of external communications at Barclays Corporate Banking explained:  ""Bit121 do not bank with Barclays. Rather, they use a payment service provider who does. I am thus unable to help you with this as Bit121 is not our client.""  When asked if this statement meant that Barclays approved of working with bitcoin exchanges through a payment service provider, Hunt replied:  ""This isn't an area we wish to comment on.""  Bit121 details  Bit121 started trading on 11th November and chief executive Jim Iddiols said daily average trading volume stands at about £100,000 from more than 500 registered users.  Registration is free and Bit121 accepts sterling-denominated bank transfers to the Barclays account. Users must complete an 'account verification' form before the exchange will approve a transfer. The form requires the user's name, address and bank account number, among other details.  The exchange also refuses to accept cash deposits. Iddiols said these measures were in place because his firm wanted to voluntarily comply with anti-money laundering rules in the UK. He added that information like customer bank account numbers were needed to process withdrawal requests.  The Bit121 site is not very forthcoming with contact details - there is an email address on the 'Contact' page, but no address or phone number.  Iddiols said that this is because e-mail is the most efficient way of handling customer inquiries. He also pointed out that Mt. Gox and Bitstamp does the same (the latter actually offers an address).  When CoinDesk checked the site on 28th November, users were asked to transfer funds to a Barclays account belonging to PacNet Services Ltd. The account's address was listed as a Barclays address at Canary Wharf in London.  But three days later, on 2nd December, the page had been changed.  Barclays' name and address had been removed from the fund transfer page. The account number remained the same. Iddiols confirmed that Bit121 had removed mention of Barclays from its site.  Iddiols confirmed that his firm has no direct relationship with Barclays. He said Bit121 worked with PacNet Services and that firm, in turn, had accounts with a number of banks, including Barclays.  ""All funds are managed by PacNet Services. Effectively, we don't touch them.""  Iddiols said that Barclays had contacted him after CoinDesk inquired about the exchange with Barclays. However, he said that Barclays and PacNet Services were aware that Bit121 operated a bitcoin exchange.  Bit121's chief executive explained:    ""We have been completely open and transparent with PacNet, and they have been completely transparent with Barclays,""      ""They absolutely know what business we are in.""    PacNet Services lists its European address in County Clare, Ireland. It was founded in 1994 in Vancouver, according to its website.  Pacnet Services describes itself as the world's leading provider of international payment processing services to the direct response industry. Its services include allowing merchants to process direct debit requests, cash cheques and accept credit cards.  Lobbying efforts  Bitcoin exchanges in the UK have failed to find banks that want to work with them. Tom Robinson, who has yet to launch his own exchange BitPrice, said he was ""surprised"" that Bit121 was successfully taking deposits through a local bank.  He said he had been turned down by ""numerous"" UK banks, including Barclays, when he approached them as a banking partner to BitPrice:  ""[UK banks] have had a blanket policy of saying 'no' to bitcoin.""  Robinson said he had also looked into using a payment services company, as Bit121 is doing. He concluded that the method wouldn't work for his company:  ""Ultimately you are a client to the bank, and when the bank finds out that the service relates to bitcoin, they are not happy with it.""  Robinson said he is now lobbying UK regulators and banks to ""open up"" bitcoin services before he launches his exchange.  Bit121 glitches  Bit121 has suffered several glitches since its launch. On 28th November it halted trading for an hour after a user suggested its trading engine had been ""miscalculating"", according to Iddiols.  The exchange was shut down while the matter was investigated and trading resumed after investigations revealed that the trading engine's calculations had been correct all along, Iddiols said.  ""At first glance, we agreed with [the user], but when we investigated, everything was working perfectly.""  The exchange also sent out a promotional e-mail that mistakenly contained a list of user's e-mail addresses on the same day.  Despite the glitches, Iddiols said he is confident in Bit121's security measures. These measures include a cold storage policy, two-factor authentication and e-mail verification for withdrawal requests.  Iddiols also said the exchange keeps a a very small number of bitcoins in its hot wallet, or the temporary bitcoin storage facility used by exchanges that has been the target of break-ins recently.  Bit121 founders  Iddiols said he had been working on Bit121 since March. He was previously a sales director at IBM, where he worked for 27 years, according to the description on his site.  The exchange is funded by Nicholas Dann, who was Iddiols' colleague at IBM, and who is now an entrepreneur and property developer. A third person, Mark Vickery, is listed on the site as a director of the firm. He owns ABL Resourcing, a financial consulting firm.  Those looking to use a UK exchange to swap their sterling to bitcoins and vice-versa are advised, as usual, to exercise their own due diligence before parting with any currency.  It's advisable to monitor reddit and the Bitcoin Talk forum for discussions related to any company you're considering using in the bitcoin space.
