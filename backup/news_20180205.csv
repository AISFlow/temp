42428516,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8Wvh,1517868351,"What to Expect When CFTC, SEC Chiefs Talk Crypto With Congress","Congress is set to hold what may be the most consequential hearing in years on the subject of cryptocurrency, with the heads of the two main U.S. financial market regulators in the hot seat.  J. Christopher Giancarlo, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and Jay Clayton, his counterpart at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), will testify on Capitol Hill tomorrow. And the process of fielding questions from the Senate Banking Committee is likely to yield one or two notable moments given recent developments in the space – including those involving the agencies themselves.  In recent months, the two agencies have, between them, filed lawsuits against alleged scams, launched investigations, overseen the launch of bitcoin futures, issued warnings to investors and, perhaps more broadly, come to terms with a rapidly-evolving environment that has, in the words of their leaders, tested the limits of their reach.  Ahead of the hearing, copies of both Clayton's and Giancarlo's testimony have been released. While largely an overview of their respective agencies' work to date, both leaders suggested that they would support, in some way, new avenues of regulation that could lead to an expansion of oversight by the U.S. government into the cryptocurrency market.  Yet such an undertaking would, in their view, require an act of Congress – as well as close involvement with the relevant agencies.  Clayton commented in his written remarks that he is ""open"" to working with U.S. lawmakers, in addition to state regulators, on the question of new rules for trading sites.  He remarked:  ""As Chairman Giancarlo and I stated recently, we are open to exploring with Congress, as well as with our federal and state colleagues, whether increased federal regulation of cryptocurrency trading platforms is necessary or appropriate. We also are supportive of regulatory and policy efforts to bring clarity and fairness to this space.""  Giancarlo's nudging toward possible changes was slightly more detailed, highlighting what he called ""shortcomings"" in the system by which each state issues money transmission licenses to businesses.  ""As the Senate Banking Committee, the Senate Agriculture Committee and other Congressional policy-makers consider the current state of regulatory oversight of cash or 'spot' transactions in virtual currencies and trading platforms, consideration should be given to shortcomings of the current approach of state-by-state money transmitter licensure that leaves gaps in protection for virtual currency traders and investors,"" he wrote.  Potential new rules governing cryptocurrency exchanges should, he went on to explain, ""be carefully tailored to the risks posed by relevant trading activity and enhancing efforts to prosecute fraud and manipulation.""  ""Overall, a rationalized federal framework may be more effective and efficient in ensuring the integrity of the underlying market,"" he went on to write.  Fireworks ahead?  What kind of event can industry-watchers expect?  The written testimony only offers a piece of what might be raised during the question-and-answer phase of the hearing. Given the significant public interest in the topic – as well as a soundbite-heavy political environment – it’s tough to know what could come up.  According to Jerry Brito, executive director of the non-profit advocacy group Coin Center, two of the prevailing news narratives of the past year – initial coin offerings (ICOs) and derivatives products like futures – are likely to dominate the discussion.  ""There's been a frenzy of ICOs,"" Brito noted, including ""a lot of crazy scams and weird stuff"" alongside serious projects and significant money invested. ""This is what sparked the hearing,"" he added.  Brito said that Coin Center has met individually with staff of more than half a dozen committee members and participated in a group briefing Friday for staff of all committee members. The room was packed, he said.  Token talk  Another issue that may come up in the hearing is the regulatory treatment of token sales, particularly when the token being sold to raise funds for a project is supposed to be useful on the network that will eventually be built.  Lewis Cohen, a partner at the law firm of Hogan Lovells in New York, said he agreed with Clayton’s comment in the prepared remarks that ICOs should be regulated as securities when they emphasize the potential for investor profits (for example, from selling tokens in the secondary market). Just because the tokens may have utility does not exempt the offering from investor protections.  But likewise, he said, the regulatory community needs to be careful not to assume that just because a token is the object of an investment scheme that it is necessarily a security itself.  It would ""make little sense,"" Cohen said, if once a functional network like Filecoin is fully up and running its users had to go to a broker-dealer to buy tokens to store data in a decentralized manner on the platform.

42428514,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8Wzh,1517865059,South Korea: North Korea Stole Millions From Crypto Exchanges Last Year,"South Korean officials believe that North Korean hackers stole tens of millions of dollars' worth in cryptocurrencies last year, according to local reports.  Kyodo News  reports that the National Intelligence Service (NIS), briefing the country's lawmakers on the cyber attacks, said that phishing scams and other methods had yielded tens of billions of won in customer funds. The news service notably reported that authorities in South Korea are probing whether the same hackers were behind last month's attack on Coincheck, which led to the theft of more than $500 million in cryptocurrency.  Last year's attack on cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb resulted in roughly 8 billion won being stolen, along with the personal information of some 30,000 customers, as previously reported by CoinDesk.  South Korean parliament member Kim Byung-kee further noted the impact of phishing emails in scamming users, according to Reuters, saying:  ""North Korea sent emails that could hack into cryptocurrency exchanges and their customers’ private information and stole (cryptocurrency) worth billions of won.""  Reclusive North Korea has been implicated in exchange hacks and scams on numerous occasions, as well as unsuccessful attempts at stealing cryptocurrencies from trading sites, as previously reported. Last year, police officials claimed that North Korean attackers attempted to trick 25 employees at four exchanges with spear phishing attacks, though none appeared to have fallen for the ruse.  The attempted thefts were first reported by cybersecurity firm FireEye, and later confirmed by government officials.  The rogue nation seems to be going after cryptocurrencies as a way to evade financial sanctions imposed by the United Nations, particularly sanctions voted in after the country's recent nuclear missile tests.

42428517,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8X1h,1517853650,The 'Dean of Blockchain Lawyers' Just Got a New Job,"One of the first and most influential lawyers to represent blockchain and cryptocurrency businesses is joining one of the industry's oldest startups in an executive role.  Announced today, Marco Santori is leaving Cooley LLP, where he's been a partner since November 2016, to become the president and chief legal officer of Blockchain, a longtime client and one of the industry's best-known wallet startups.  The move is a return to roots for Santori, who started out advising early bitcoin startups on legal and policy matters but over the years shifted to working on enterprise blockchains and, most recently, initial coin offerings.  But he said his heart was always in bitcoin's potential to empower individuals.  ""I didn't get into this to do ICOs,"" Santori told CoinDesk. ""It's a fascinating area of the law, but that's not the train that I'm on.""  Likewise, he said:  ""I'm not trying to rebuild Wall Street on top of a blockchain. I'm trying to give ordinary people a better option for finance, a better option for storing their funds and using their funds.""  Blockchain is the best place for him to fulfill that vision, Santori said. The company, which has offices in New York and London, allows users to store and send bitcoin through their web browsers without downloading any software.  It's raised a total of $70 million to date. According to co-founder and CEO Peter Smith, the company has more than 20 million users.  Strategic role  Smith said Santori will play a strategic role, helping Blockchain meet the demand that exploded last year by scaling up not only the legal and regulatory functions but also corporate development, including acquisitions and partnerships.  ""In our space, it's so special: go-to-market strategies and acquisition strategies are all reliant on the regulatory and legal side,"" Smith told CoinDesk. ""Having someone come out of that vertical who understands how to run deals is very key.""  Santori is uniquely suited for such a role, having been on ""at least one side of every major transaction in the digital currency space over the last four years,"" Smith said.  The chief legal officer position is newly created. The president's title previously belonged to Blockchain co-founder Nic Cary, who will maintain an active role as vice chairman, focusing on public affairs and external relations as Santori takes over the policy and expansion duties, a company spokeswoman said.  Cary said in a press release that he will be ""dedicating more of my time [to] building our brand in key regions like India, hiring the brightest talent, and educating more people on the benefits of digital assets.""  A long, strange trip  In many ways, Santori's career has mirrored the blockchain industry's evolution.  He first made a name for himself as a bitcoin-savvy lawyer while working at Nesenoff & Miltenberg LLP. In 2013, he became the chairman of regulatory affairs committee at the Bitcoin Foundation and the following year represented the trade group during the New York State Department of Financial Services' BitLicense hearings, watched across the globe.  In late 2014, he joined the white-shoe firm of Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, and simultaneously was retained as global policy counsel for Blockchain. Santori made partner at Pillsbury two years later.  This period coincided with a long bear market for bitcoin. The industry's focus turned to seeking ways corporations and governments could take advantage of the underlying technology without having to touch the currency.  During that era, Santori was a key figure in shaping the state of Delaware's blockchain strategy. He helped to craft legislation that allowed firms incorporated in the First State to record their shares on a distributed ledger.  At Cooley, where Santori's been a partner since November 2016, his work has centered around ICOs, which took off like a rocket last year, despite the legal uncertainties surrounding these token sales.  ICO controversies  Santori tried to bring some clarity to the market last year with the SAFT, or Simple Agreement for Future Tokens.  In this structure, a blockchain project raises money exclusively from accredited investors, thereby avoiding securities registration requirements; once a network or product is built, the tokens needed to use it are distributed to the investors, who can resell them to the public.  The SAFT idea has been controversial, with some legal scholars fearing it may have the opposite effect from its intent and increase the legal risk for token issues.  Meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators around the globe have begun cracking down on ICOs. And last month, without naming any names, SEC chairman Jay Clayton voiced disapproval of lawyers who have been advising ICOs that resemble securities offerings but don't comply with the securities laws.  Santori said his move to Blockchain was in the works long before Clayton made those remarks. As for the remarks themselves, he gave a very lawyerly response.  ""The SEC and the bar are in a learning process about how these things ought to be treated, about where the value is, where the risk is,"" Santori said, adding:  ""Regulators all around the world are responding primarily to headlines. There's been a failure on the part of the industry and the bar to explain the value to regulators. We all have a lot of work to do together.""  Santori said his departure from Cooley is bittersweet, since he hasn't finished building the firm's fintech practice, but there aren't enough hours in the day to do that and perform his new duties at Blockchain.  ""I wish I could do both,"" he said.

42428508,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8Whh,1517851825,US Commodities Regulator Warns on Crypto Retirement Scams,"Consumers should be wary of cryptocurrency retirement accounts claiming to be approved by the Internal Revenue Service, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has warned.  In a new circular dated Feb. 2, the CFTC is calling for people to ""be cautious"" about such pitches, especially those claiming that the U.S. tax authority had in some way reviewed or endorsed the product. The IRS, the CFTC noted, ""does not approve or review investments for IRAs.""  The agency went on to write:  ""Taxpayers tend to focus on retirement savings more at tax time in order to increase deductions or maximize savings. As a result, some businesses may attempt to lure customers into buying highly volatile cryptocurrencies using false claims or by painting virtual currencies as less risky because they can be used for retirement saving.""  As previously reported by CoinDesk, individual retirement accounts involving cryptocurrencies aren't exactly new. But the CFTC circular indicates that some pitches being made to U.S. taxpayers in recent do not disclose all of the relevant risks – or are outright fraudulent.  ""Custodians and trustees of self-directed IRAs may have limited duties to investors and generally will not evaluate the quality or legitimacy of an investment or its promoters,"" the agency said in its release.  The CFTC has taken an increasingly proactive role in regulating activities around cryptocurrencies, including a recent move to beef up its scrutiny of proposed financial products including futures. Agency chairman, J. Christopher Giancarlo, is set to appear before the Senate Banking Committee on Feb. 6 to discuss the CFTC's oversight of the market.

A summary of the proposed rules explains how service providers that accept cryptocurrencies would have to report their business and earnings to the Ministry of Economics and Finance, as well as what the government will do with that information.  The full decree also clarifies that, while cryptocurrencies are ""used as a means of exchange for the purchase of goods and services, [they are] not issued by a central bank or by a public authority, [and are] not necessarily connected to a currency having legal tender.""  The main purpose of the decree is to enforce recently implemented anti-money laundering rules passed by the European Union, of which Italy is a founding member. In addition, it was prompted by new regulations on the financing of terrorism and other criminal activities.  To that end, businesses that transact with cryptocurrencies would be recorded on a new database by the Agency for Agents and Mediators.  As part of the feedback process, the government hopes to gauge the size of the domestic market for cryptocurrencies and the number of businesses working with them, according to the document.  Roberto Ciciani, director of the agency responsible for the prevention of financial crimes, stated:  ""The census and the start of the register will also allow to better monitor compliance with the rules by the operators and give them certainty about the legal exercise of their activity .""  Interested parties within Italy have until Feb. 16 to weigh in on the subject, while the new rules will be implemented before July 2018.

42428498,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8WVh,1517842849,Texas Hits Another Crypto Lending Platform with Cease-and-Desist,"Texas' securities agency has issued another cryptocurrency-focused emergency cease-and-desist order, this time against a lending scheme called DavorCoin.  In its latest filing, signed Feb. 2, the Texas State Securities Board (TSSB) alleges DavorCoin has been issuing unregistered securities with fraudulent and misleading information to lure investors.  The filing arrives just days after the TSSB gave filed similar cease-and-desists over an overseas initial coin offering project called R2B Coin, as well as BitConnect, the cryptocurrency exchange and lending program that faced closure and a class action lawsuit after the TSSB's allegations.  In fact, TSSB alleges in the document that DavorCoin, operating in a similar manner to BitConnect, emerged and drew the regulator’s attention after the latter ceased its business.  According to the agency, DavorCoin also launched a lending program that promised investors a significant return of investment, which falls under the agency’s definition of unregistered securities.  Based on the document, potential investors would need to purchase the project's token, dubbed DavorCoin, using other cryptocurrencies to participate in the lending program.  “At approximately 5:30 p.m. CST on Jan. 26, 2018, it [DavorCoin] represented that an investor lending $30,000 in DavorCoin who elects a 'Locking period' of 120 days may earn $513 per day, $3591 per seven days, $15,390 per 30 days and $107,217 as of the 'capital release day' of August 23, 2018,” the document stated.  The TSSB also alleged that the project is an investment fraud, because DavorCoin had intentionally hidden material information of its business – including its principles and business location, as well as how it plans to realize investment promises for investors.  The DavorCoin order yet again indicates the increasing level of focus Texas' securities agency is giving to cryptocurrency-related investment.  The agency said that while its mandate is not seeking to regulate cryptocurrencies, it will continue monitoring cryptocurrency projects that aim to bring returns to investors.  In a statement sent to CoinDesk, the TSSB's director of enforcement, Joseph Rotunda, commented:  ""As cryptocurrencies continue to generate considerable attention in the media and interest from the public, these illegal and fraudulent securitized cryptocurrency offerings pose a grave threat to traditional investors. Absent a fair description of the terms of a product, the identity and qualifications of principals and the material risks associated with an offering, traditional investors may well be exposed to irreparable harm.""

42428520,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8X5h,1517839848,7 Tough Legal Lessons for Crypto Entrepreneurs,"Stephen Palley is a lawyer in private practice in Washington, D.C. with the firm of Anderson Kill. The views expressed are his alone. You can find him on Twitter at @stephendpalley.      One day you're a crypto-millionaire, the next you're a crypto-defendant.  Initial coin offerings (ICOs) made crypto-news throughout 2017. Announcements of new offerings became a flood as winter turned to spring and then summer.  As 2017 closed, an assortment of ICO litigation has followed.  What's the good news? If I am making lemons out of lemonade, we will have more clarity from regulators and courts.  Some might argue that the clarity was already contained in the rules and cases but the abstraction has been made real by the mistakes of others. And it you're a crypto-entrpreneur in 2018, this is a good thing.  For lawyers, some of what follows may be Captain Obvious territory, but here are seven observations:  The long arm of the law really is long  Think being in Switzerland can stop you from getting served with a U.S. lawsuit? Nope.  And very nope if you use email, Twitter or LinkedIn.  In one of the half-dozen Tezos lawsuits, the plaintiff asked to serve the lawsuit on Swiss defendants using email (the Tezos Foundation and Diego Ponz), email and Twitter (Johann Gevers), and email and LinkedIn (Guido Schmitz-Krummacher, Bitcoin Suisse AG and Niklas Nikolajsen).  The court said yes, finding that:  ""Plaintiff has shown (1) the Swiss Defendants are not within any judicial district of the United States; (2) service by electronic means is not prohibited by any international agreement, (3) service by the electronic means specified below comports with constitutional notions of due process and is reasonably calculated to apprise the Swiss Defendants of the pendency of the action and afford [them] an opportunity to respond.""  After this order was entered, the parties entered into an agreement by which they asked the court to vacate the order in exchange for the defendants appearing in the case, while reserving all objections to jurisdiction and service.  The tactic had the effect of getting a bunch of Swiss defendants to quickly appear in a U.S. lawsuit. And it shows that a federal judge believes that international social media service is acceptable, which is quite something. (See also Blockchain Jurisdiction, by yours truly).  Scammers gonna scam  If it was a scam before Satoshi conceived bitcoin, it's still a scam today.  If you're a recidivist securities law violator who promises a 1,000 percent plus return on investment in less than a month and doesn't actually do anything with the money that you raise from investors other than renovate your house, the SEC is likely to come calling. (See, for example, Plexcoin).  This isn't really ICO litigation – it's a securities fraud enforcement action where the alleged fraudsters happened to use ICO lingo to raise money.  Lawyers can read  Regulators and class action lawyers know how to read! As someone pointed out in a blog post last year, everything that you write is evidence – your white paper, tweets, Slack channel, etc.  And as that someone predicted, ICO lawsuits quote liberally from all of these sources. Like, think actual screenshots from Slack in lawsuits.  It's called a 'statute of limitation'  Litigation and regulatory enforcement actions take time. Just because you haven’t gotten a subpoena from The Man in the month since your decentralized cheese token went live, it doesn't mean you won't.  Coinbase's tangle with the IRS is a case in point, ultimately addressing accounts in existence between 2013 and 2015. This doesn't mean that the IRS isn't going to go after accounts from 2015 to 2017, it just means that they take their sweet time, as do other agencies.  It's a courtroom, not Twitter  What gets you likes on crypto Twitter doesn't work in Court.  One of my favorite reported cases from 2017 is a late-December New York State Supreme Court (that’s a trial court) decision that addressed a challenge to New York’s BitLicense regulations. (The case is Chino v New York Dept. of Fin. Servs., 2017 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 5153, Dec. 21, 2017).  The plaintiff filled out a partial application, but did not include most of the required information and asked for a waiver of the $5,000 application fee.  According to the Court, he ""filled out some but not all financial information on the form requested, and he indicated that he had no insurance and kept no financial or accounting books.""  For his background report certification, he wrote: ""[Could] not obtain in time."" He also demanded the depositions of Paul Krugman and former New York Department of Financial Services superintendent Benjamin Lawsky.  Apparently, ""but bitcoin"" was not good enough for the court, which threw his lawsuit out (and rejected the deposition requests).  Create governance or it'll be created for you  I see companies operating on different sides of the spectrum here.  In some cases, people completely dispense with corporate formalities, raise money and then effectively hope for the best.  Don't be that company.  If you create governance, understand it  It turns out that creating a Swiss foundation to raise hundreds of millions of dollars in an ICO doesn’t mean you can actually use the money.  While this would be no surprise to lawyers involved in creating the things, a Swiss foundation is ""an autonomous legal entity.""  Here's a court filing that says exactly this:  What does it mean to create an ""autonomous"" corporate entity? It means that you may not really control it!  And as a practical matter, this means that the Tezos founders can't directly access the $1.3 billion controlled by the foundation they created.  I could go on and on about Tezos (and I have, which you know if you follow me on Twitter). For now, I am going to keep it simple.  The trend of U.S. blockchain startups creating Swiss foundations is over. It makes no more sense than a Swiss startup incorporating a U.S. non-profit in Hackensack, N.J.  Conclusions  So what are my predictions for 2018?  I think flying cars are still a couple of years off, but I do expect to see more litigation over botched ICO governance, judgment collection that tangles with private keys, and a healthy lump of workout-related legal work — that is, fixing businesses that have significant assets but did things the wrong way.  A year from now we will have more precedent, more guidance from the mistakes of others, and maybe even a few genuine successes.

42428519,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8X7h,1517838624,The Crypto Market Is Down Over 50% from 2018 Highs,"The total value of all publicly traded cryptocurrencies hit a combined $366 billion today, the lowest figure observed for the market since Dec. 4, data from CoinMarketCap reveals.  The more than 60-day low, however, can also be read more bearishly, as it represents a 50 percent drop from the market's all-time high above $830 billion in early January.  Indeed, for the second time in just four days, the market is awash with double-digit declines, as in just a few short weeks a combination of new buyer fatigue and negative news appears to have taken its toll.  This time, the culprit may be speculation that new buyers may be further discouraged due to reports China could further restrict domestic buyers from overseas market resources, while major credit card issuers across the globe are reportedly restricting access to cryptocurrency buying.  Still, year-over-year, the figures are less bleak, as the market is up more than 1,800 percent from just $19 billion in Feb. 2017.  As such, traders may be trading the declines and otherwise taking their negative news in stride. Further data analysis reveals the market is still trading above the $355 billion total observed on Friday, when the market saw a similar period of double-digit declines.  That said, the markets are fast losing altitude.  Here's an update of the current market prices and most recent lows:      ETH  Ethereum's ether (ETH) cryptocurrency is trading at $783, a near three-week low. At press time, ETH was trading at its lowest level since Jan. 17.  XRP  Fresh off securing its status as the worst-performing cryptocurrency of Jan. 2018, XRP, the native cryptocurrency of the RippleNet blockchain dropped 12 percent Monday to $0.76.  Overall, however, it's three-day low, as XRP saw lower lows on Friday when it declined to $0.63.  BCH  Another one of January's biggest losers, bitcoin cash (BCH), which hit a low of $980.78 on Friday, was last seen trading at $1,026.  Given the cryptocurrency's large China community, though, this response may be encouraging, as it was down 13.26 percent in the last 24 hours but above its more recent lows.  Cardano  Another relative newcomer to the large-cap cryptocurrency rankings, the asset is nonetheless trading up still from recent lows.  At press time, cardano is changing hands at $0.34 today, up 25 percent from Friday figures.  LTC  Litecoin is down 12 percent at $137, but still well above last week's low of $105.35.  That said, the situation was markedly different yesterday, when it was one of the top gainers, clocking a high of $173.80. The price rise was reportedly fueled by a fake rumor that LTC was forking. However, the rumor was dismissed by litecoin creator Charlie Lee.  XLM  STR, the native cryptocurrency of the Stellar network is changing hands at $0.34, up from Friday’s low of $0.28.  NEO  At $95.65, NEO is close to Friday's low of $91.96.  Still, given its largely China-based community, the crypto asset may be sending a strong signal that the news today, in which the country could further restrict access to the market, may be encouraging.  EOS  EOS is trading at $8.20 – up 56 cents from last week's low.  NEM  Notably, NEM was last seen trading at $0.50, up 13 percent from Friday's figure of $0.44. However, it's also notably lower than it was in late January, a time when it was making headlines for its role in a hack on a major Japanese exchange.

A report from Financial News, a website tied to the People's Bank of China (the country's central bank), indicates that authorities there are stepping up a crackdown that began roughly a year ago.  ""To prevent financial risks, China will step up measures to remove any onshore or offshore platforms related to virtual currency trading or ICOs,"" the website reported, according to a translation published by the South China Morning Post.  The move comes months after China formally banned investments in initial coin offerings (ICOs), deeming the blockchain use case to constitute a form of illegal financing. Authorities there also shuttered online websites for crypto-trading, with the ""Big Three"" exchanges closing this past fall.  The new reports show that China is now targeting overseas websites catering to local users. According to the translation from SCMP, the actions are begin taken because ""after the closure of the domestic virtual currency exchanges, many people turned to overseas platforms to continue participating in virtual currency transactions.""  A separate Feb. 4 report from Chinese-language news service Xinhua and published on bitcoin social media site 8btc, cites a statement from the People's Bank of China regarding the overseas website ban. Per the statement, authorities are moving to ""ban all crypto-related commercial business including banning and blocking both domestic and offshore cryptocurrency trading platform websites.""  ""Once found, will be immediately shut down. The future depends on its development and does not rule out the possibility of unveiling further regulatory measures,"" the report further adds.

Issued on Feb. 4 by the Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA), the circular alerts residents in the country to be aware of the risk of investing in token-based fundraising activities such as ICOs and token pre-sales.  The risks, as stated out by the SCA, could stem from both the project being presented in an unaudited or misleading manner, as well as highly volatile price fluctuations after a token starts trading on a secondary market.  The SCA further highlights that, since the agency doesn't currently regulate or supervise any ICO projects, no legal protection can be provided to investors in a case of fraud.  In addition, the agency warns that investing in overseas ICO projects may also prove to be risky, depending on whether or not the market is formally regulated.  The SCA states:  ""ICOs may be issued abroad, and therefore are subject to foreign laws and regulations that can be difficult to verify. Tracking and recovering funds in case of ICO collapse may prove to be extremely difficult in practice.""  With the circular, the authority becomes the latest among worldwide financial regulators to have formally issued warnings to residents on ICO investment risks.  The alert also follows the country's capital city government, which in October last year revealed guidance that seeks to apply anti-money laundry and know-your-customer rules to ICO projects.

42428512,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8Wth,1517821208,Enterprise Blockchain May Be Ready for Its Breakout,"It turns out, last year's mantra ""make blockchain real"" was little more than wishful thinking.  Instead of the increased efficiency, enterprises have encountered impractically slow transaction volumes; instead of a transparent world with ultimate accountability, companies holding sensitive customer data faced regulatory concerns.  Still, there's reason to believe the same rosy-colored forecast just might come true this year.  The reason for that optimism, it turns out, is that even if the blockchains didn't become real for businesses in 2017, they did become tangible in terms of technology. And now that the software has been built, those working close on development say live trials are just around the corner.  ""All these experiments and proofs-of-concept were not done in a vacuum and they were not done for fun,"" said Charley Cooper, managing director of the R3 distributed ledger consortium, which has its own series of live applications in the final stages of launch.  He told CoinDesk:  ""They were done to bear out what could and could not be done effectively on the technology, and what we felt would be meaningful commercial opportunities.""  In short, making blockchain real is no longer abstract, it's on the verge of being good business.  1. The software is ready  But to understand how the abstract utopia of cryptocurrency becomes more than just a business interest, one needs to revisit a slew of successes that have flown under the radar.  Most recently, groups of financial institutions and enterprises (R3, the Linux-led Hyperledger consortium and the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance) have all seen major software milestones.  For example, computing hardware giant Intel last week launched Hyperledger Sawtooth 1.0 to the Hyperledger code repository. Created in partnership with more than 50 coders representing dozens of companies, the software joins the IBM-contributed Hyperledger Fabric and R3's Corda as the latest blockchain solutions to release a version intended to give developers a sense of confidence.  Building on these solutions, versions of the open-source software platforms that can be monetized have also hit the market.  Last year, IBM launched IBM Blockchain, an enterprise-grade version of the software, and later this quarter, R3 will do the same with its own Corda platform, dubbed Enterprise Corda.  These commercialized versions of open-source software will, in turn, enable a number of industry-specific blockchain applications. Last year, Walmart, Kroger, and Nestle helped launch a food tracking network using IBM Blockchain, and new solutions are expected to be explored this year, according to a representative of the company.  In a similar way, R3's Corda Enterprise is already in limited use with live applications from both Finastra and HQLAx. Both are expected to be available in the first half of 2018, according to Cooper.  Also, JPMorgan's Quorum – which has been the most public solution associated with the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance – launched into version 2.0 last November, and for the strength of the team behind the software, it's worth keeping an eye on.  2. Interoperability is moving forward  With the software laid down, it's also a safe bet there will be advances on the idea that blockchains can and should connect in order to assuage businesses wary of investing in the wrong tech, or being worried about getting boxed out of future business opportunities.  As an early example, last August Monax integrated with Hyperledger Sawtooth to enable ethereum smart contracts on the platform, and a few months later Deloitte spin-off Nuco helped gather a group of companies specifically to address interoperability.  In a move that stands to accelerate similar integration, a version of Interledger, originally created by Ripple specifically to facilitate interoperability, has already been contributed to the Hyperledger consortium.  For an idea of what this could mean in a bigger context, last June, Interledger was successfully tested across seven different ledgers, including multiple blockchains.  The chairman of Hyperledger's technical steering committee, and CTO of IBM's open technology, Chris Ferris told CoinDesk interoperability would play a crucial role in 2018:  ""Whether that's Fabric and Sawtooth working with Burrow, or whether its Fabric and Sawtooth projects working with Indy, and collaborating on those various technologies, those are the kind of things we're starting to see.""  3. Ripple and Swift will change the game  Also likely heightening business interest will be blockchain's observable impact.  Indeed, one of the most notable trends this year could end up involving Swift, the inter-bank messaging platform that was early on identified as the ultimate middleman.  Last year, the member-owned network of banks and other financial institutions revealed a successful proof-of-concept aimed at reimagining the nostro-vostro accounts used by companies to store cash around the world, and in January, it signed an agreement with seven central securities depositories to evolve the way the centralized organizations might leverage blockchain.  But while this might look innovative in its own right, Swift's moves are more interesting if you consider Ripple, the blockchain startup that in 2012 set out to disrupt it.  While Ripple was a scrappy Silicon Valley startup for years, it's unique – and controversial – approach to offering public and private blockchain technology has transformed it into a juggernaut. At today's XRP price of $0.84, the 61 billion XRP Ripple owns is worth about $51 billion, though much of that is locked up in smart contracts designed to restrict the company's access.  It's likely that Ripple's executives won't waste any time putting the funds they can access to work, as they've already shown they're willing to spend money to make the case a distributed ledger solution can save clients money – even throwing conferences to prove it.  Will Ripple evolve to challenge Swift on messaging? Will it continue to emphasize its ability to provide better market liquidity? Or will it do both? It remains to be seen.  Time will tell, too, how Swift responds, but be sure that businesses are likely to take notice if the feud continues to attract global headlines.  4. Bank PoCs will evolve  While networks of companies remain at the center of where most people in blockchain think the technology is headed, a few leaders from both the legacy firms and startups will likely continue to chalk out their own territory.  Look for UBS to continue its own leadership role among a consortium of other banks, building on its plan to use a private version of the ethereum blockchain to speed along the newly implemented Mifid II regulatory requirements in Europe. The Swiss bank is also taking a leading role in Utility Settlement Coin (USC), which is exploring the potential benefits of blockchain for central banks.  Beyond financial applications, some of the largest companies in the world have spun off their own blockchain startups to help commercialize their work.  Global shipping-giant Maersk last year spun-off its blockchain supply chain work into a still-unnamed joint venture with IBM that is currently looking to provide streamlined services to other shipping companies. Electronics manufacturing giant Foxconn similarly spun-off a blockchain supply chain financing startup, in partnership with peer-to-peer lender, Dianrong.  Also, traditionally described as one of the ""Big Four"" accounting firms, Deloitte has made a concerted effort to transform itself into a technology consulting firm by helping its clients navigate the blockchain space. Importantly, it's also begun to evolve the traditional understanding of what accounting itself looks like in the age of blockchain.  As an example of an even more independent operation undertaken by a legacy firm, the maker of Mercedes-Benz last year issued a $100 million bond on a private version of the ethereum blockchain. This year, Daimler has confirmed it is continuing it's blockchain work on a number of other – yet unspecified – blockchain projects.  ""Our work on blockchain is ongoing,"" said Hendrik Sackmann, a senior Daimler communications manager.  5. Cryptocurrency enters the mix  Another change on the horizon could be an increased willingness by enterprises to talk about – and even publicly explore – cryptocurrencies.  Most notably, among this group, is IBM, which last year revealed work with cryptocurrency startup Stellar and is now looking at ways to explore open blockchains in cross-border payments and last week revealed a test called Fabric Coin designed to demonstrate how the blockchain works.    Perhaps the most similar of these startups to the enterprises exploring blockchain via consortia is Multichain, which last year revealed a number of new partners in its own consortium, followed closely by the launch of its own open-source version 1.0 enterprise software.  Unlike enterprise consortia, while Multichain does not require the use of a cryptocurrency, it is designed to easily integrate with the bitcoin blockchain.  Leading the way with another cryptocurrency, is ConsenSys, a collection of startups that are working both independently and with enterprises to leverage both private and permissioned versions of the ethereum blockchain and its accompanying cryptocurrency ether.  Hidden among this rapidly maturing blockchain startup community are also a number of sleeper startups that could be up to similar game-changing projects.  The most notable of these sleeper startups are Tradewinds, the blockchain spin-off behind the IEX exchange made famous in Michael Lewis's ""Flash Boys,"" which is expected to emerge later this year with some big news, and two startups from within R3: Post Oak Labs, a fintech consultancy with blockchain roots and DrumG, building products for clients using Corda.  What each of the blockchain startups catering to enterprises have in common, according to Hu Liang, founder of another leader in the space, venture-backed blockchain operating system, Omniex, is some rather unusual positioning, from a historical perspective.  Unlike most financial innovations, which are led by commercial consumers, blockchain started the other way around, leaving enterprises to catch up.  Liang, who previously worked at bank and asset managing giant, State Street, told CoinDesk:  ""Crypto is the only asset class in history that was initially driven by the retail community. Because of the run-up in that price it obviously has brought up the interest of institutional investors.""

42401003,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLZs3,1517806914,Blockstream Devs Depart for New World Computer Project,"Disrupting the internet?  Not just fodder for TV jokes, it's a goal that continues to capture the imaginations of developers in the blockchain sphere, and Ben Gorlick and Johnny Dilley are no exception.  Turns out, the developers liked the idea so much they ditched one of the most renowned tech companies in the blockchain industry, Blockstream, to join up with a startup called Crowd Machine where they now serve as the CTO and chief of system architecture, respectively.  In short, the developers believe today's cloud computing services, which power most of the internet, leave much to be desired. And, like many other blockchain and ICO projects, Crowd Machine thinks blockchain technology could be crucial to improving the situation.  But with this project, there's a twist.  The long-in-development distributed cloud computer is unique in that it aims to harness the power of blockchain to make app creation faster and cheaper, and to do this using ""any blockchain"" they want, starting with ethereum.  The idea has already attracted a handful of Fortune 500 companies such as GE and Anthem, who are now customers of Crowd Machine (according to the project's website). Other ""big IoT"" company partners are reportedly planning to use it as their primary application, to be revealed in the coming months.  Gorlick told CoinDesk:  ""What we're working on is a real gamechanger with the way in which software can be built and executed.""  That's why Gorlick's switching gears. Though he cherished working with ""top minds in cryptocurrency and computer science"" at Blockstream, he thinks it's a problem that blockchains are so difficult to build on.  ""Empowering people to do that,"" he said, was a key reason he switched.  Crowd efficiency  To explain how Crowd Machine works, Gorlick offered the idea of a basic calendar app.  Usually such an app would be deployed on a commonly used cloud platform like Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud, because these tools make it easier to deploy and manage websites. Under the hood, every time a users updates the calendar, in what's called an ""activity,"" the developer is charged.  Gorlick thinks this setup is a ""bottleneck"" that leads to lot of waste.  The efficiency of Crowd Machine, Gorlick said, comes from breaking each of these activities into a bunch of pieces then shooting them off to a network of devices that each computes them together. ""The still runs and executes the program, but users aren't bottlenecked to a single provider,"" he said.  If everything goes according to plan, users will be paid to run these programs on all sorts of devices, say if people have free space on their laptops, smartphones or even Internet of Things devices using Crowd Machine's so-called ""Crowd Computer,"" set to be released in the final quarter of 2018.  ""That's where the crowd computer was born,"" Gorlick said.  But, is this really a bottleneck for users? Gorlick offered the example banks using AWS have to reconcile their databases at the end of every day, a process that takes about an hour with platforms like AWS.  ""What we figured out if we didn't need to depend on a single providers to many devices. That cuts down the time significantly, to 10 seconds or a minute,"" Gorlick said, adding:  ""That's going to be a huge money saver.""  It uses ""strong federation,"" an idea Gorlick and Dilley came up with while at Blockstream, to give guarantees that nodes will run the code as they're supposed to – in part incentivized by the Crowd Machine tokens.  Coding without code  In short, the core idea is to cut down runtime costs, but another huge component is that Crowd Machine want to cut down the costs of creating the app as well.  ""Writing a smart contract sounds quite daunting. The barrier needs to be lowered,"" Gorlick said.  There are a few pieces to Crowd Machine, which makes it a bit confusing, almost with a ""Rube Goldberg"" feel to it. For example, the idea is you won't necessary have to know how to code at all to be able to create blockchain apps, because Crowd App Studio allows users to create apps by way of a drag-and-drop visual interface.  One section of the app even allows users to design ethereum smart contracts without needing to know ethereum's programming language, Solidity, which is notoriously difficult to learn.  Other blockchain languages, such as bitcoin's Script, will be supported one day, too.  Gorlick went as far as to say his dream is to make it easier for users in developing countries in Africa and Southeast Asia to bring their blockchain ideas to fruition without the costs of AWS.  Will it work, though?  If these two pieces sound like unrelated, they actually tie together in a clever way.  While the general idea of a distributed computer has an been an idea for a long time, Gorlick thinks tying easy app creation with the network will help with this problem.  ""It's funny, there are a bunch of different companies out there looking to solve this problem of creating some sort of a supercomputer or a mesh network or edge computers,"" Gorlick said.  But he believes all to date have been lacking.  ""You kind of have the chicken-and-egg problem. If you build the best network ever, but you don't have a development environment to utilize it, it won't be used and you won't get a network effect. You need to have a compelling reason to use a network in the first place,"" Gorlick continued.  He thinks the missing piece could be a development environment along the lines of Crowd App Studio making it easy to actually deploy apps on the blockchain.  He concluded:  ""We believe that having an environment where you can execute and run them on a whole variety of blockchains is a compelling reason.""

42401008,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLZvz,1517799924,Chinese Search Giant Baidu Just Launched Its Own CryptoKitties,"Baidu, China's search engine giant, has launched a new CryptoKitties-like service as part of its wider work with blockchain.  Dubbed ""Leci Gou"" (in a similar pronunciation to ""Let's Go""), the service centers around the digital adoption and trade of puppies, the transactions for which are recorded on a blockchain. That said, it's unclear at this time whether Baidu is using a public network or its own internal one for this purpose.  The website lists various digital puppies with different designs and prices, with each ranked by their scarcity. Users with Baidu accounts are able to adopt one crypto-dog and receive 1000 points for free on the marketplace, which can be further used to trade with other ""owners.""  The new initiative from Baidu – considered China's Google – is akin to CryptoKitties, the ethereum-based digital pet initiative that went viral late last year and ultimately led to a deluge of transactions on that public network amid swelling interest. It also sparked a range of copycat projects hoping to piggyback on the CryptoKitties craze.  The website details that the service was developed by Baidu's in-house blockchain team, which is also a member of the Linux Foundation-led Hyperledger consortium.  According to Chinese media outlets iFeng.com and Leiphone, Baidu said the project is available for public use but is still being tested and further developed.  The search giant framed the work as its latest foray into the application of blockchain – as reported previously, the company has also revealed its own blockchain-as-a-service platform.
