42431623,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4PXh,1584141305,$100M+ in Margin Calls: Crypto Lenders Demand Collateral as Market Buckles,"The budding market for cryptocurrency-backed loans met its first big stress test this week as bitcoin (BTC) dropped 40 percent and lenders demanded additional collateral from borrowers.      In the last day, Genesis Capital called an additional $100 million of collateral from its selective pool of about 40 clients, CEO Michael Moro said Friday afternoon. Rival Celsius Network – which lends to 225 institutions, making up up a loan book of $400 million to $600 million at any given time – has seen margin calls in the hundreds of millions, according to CEO Alex Mashinsky.      Meanwhile, Nexo’s co-founder Antoni Trenchev said some customers have repaid loans while it has liquidated other clients’ collateral, the equivalent of foreclosing on a home mortgage. And BlockFi reported in a blog post that it made margin calls on its dollar-denominated loan book, with some liquidations, but declined to comment further.      “As of five minutes ago, everyone who needed to post collateral has,” Moro said. “We’ve had zero liquidation events. … What we have done to augment our lending is we have not made any additional loans in the last few days.”      In the past year, crypto lending activity has mushroomed, as some holders sought to earn a yield on their assets, others sought to raise cash without selling their coins and market makers borrowed to fill orders quickly. The phenomenon could potentially improve liquidity and price discovery for crypto assets but it also has introduced systemic risks.      Read more: Crypto Lending 101    Wait and see    Now, Genesis doesn’t plan to make any loans that are collateralized less than 100 percent until the market calms down, Moro said.      While Genesis is still trying to figure out what interest rates should look like in the volatile environment, the unit of Digital Currency Group is raising collateral requirements on loans from around 105 percent to between 110 and 120 percent for loans backed by bitcoin, which make up the majority of its loan book. If volatility doesn’t subside, collateral levels could rise further, to anywhere between 130 and 150 percent, as underwriting standards continue to tighten.      As the market dropped, Moro said demand shifted from fiat loans to bitcoin loans as traders looked to arbitrage the difference between bitcoin’s spot and futures prices. At sister company Genesis Trading, Moro said, only about 60 percent of clients were selling while 40 percent were still buying.      Given the turmoil, “I would have expected it to be 80/20 or 90/10,” he said.    'Best day ever'    Celsius also raised collateral standards after Thursday’s rout, but Mashinsky claimed it was the “best day ever” for the company as it “loaned more than ever and charged the most interest” than it ever has.      For example, loans on ether now carry an eye-popping interest rate of around 260 percent compared to 15 to 20 percent under normal circumstances and 4 or 5 percent in the calmest of times, Mashinsky said.      As Celsius grows, however, it plans to tighten the limits on credit lines it offers, Mashinsky said.    Product delay    Nexo is holding the launch of a product that would allow users to earn interest on their crypto, Trenchev said. (The company only offers crypto-collateralized fiat loans and interest on fiat and stablecoins.)      “We were going to launch two weeks from now,” Trenchev said. “But we have to wait for this to play out, before we feel confident to launch.”      Trenchev said he’s confident that demand for fiat loans will hold steady as bitcoin seems to have bottomed around $3,867 and he does not plan to change interest rates. Nexo’s loans are typically collateralized between 200 and 500 percent, he added.      “The beauty of collateralized loans is you don’t have to worry about the underwriting process that much,” Trenchev said. “I would argue that digital assets are the best collateral – better than a penthouse on Fifth Avenue. You might have a steady price situation, but with digital assets you have instant liquidity.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/13/100m-in-margin-calls-crypto-lenders-demand-collateral-as-market-buckles,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/96ed196dd22a3fe9c1c430a2ac8387f69e1356df-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431625,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4Pfh,1584136233,Thursday’s Market Madness Strained Ethereum’s Killer App: DeFi,"So many people were trying to use the Ethereum blockchain during Thursday’s market meltdown that many applications simply stopped working as intended.      The decentralized finance (DeFi) sector was hit particularly hard.      The decentralized services that feed price information into these headless lending platforms – known as “oracles” in the industry – simply couldn’t keep up.      Oracles could not send accurate price data and traders could not execute trades without paying horrendous fees to record transactions onto the blockchain.      In a throwback to 2017, the Ethereum network became too crowded to execute transactions for many projects. In 2017, it was NFT gaming app CryptoKitties that overloaded Ethereum by issuing too many transactions during a bull market. At one point, 30,000 transactions were stuck in the queue waiting to be processed by the network.      Thursday’s mass transaction action was caused by the precarious plummet of ether’s price, which shed 30 percent in 24 hours in a network first.      Pricing oracles – typically Chainlink or Maker’s V2 oracle – were the main victims Thursday.      Several of Chainlink’s 21 oracles were down during prime trading hours, according to bZx co-founder and CEO Tom Bean.      Stani Kulechov, founder and CEO of DeFi platform Aave, said he saw a Maker oracle throw a “20 percent price deviation” between the actual market price and Maker’s generated feed.      Oracles query data from on- or off-chain sources. Contracts pulling from on-chain sources had their requests crowded out by other transactions on the ethereum network, leading to oracle failures for both V2 and Chainlink.      Orders were also backlogged on the Ethereum mainnet and traders were forced to pay outlandish gas fees to settle.      For example, users were not able to perform trades on exchange dYdX or lending platform Nuo Network. Both DeFi platforms changed their fee structures (including dYdX multiple times) to execute a slew of backlogged trades Thursday and early Friday.      “The network condition is affecting everyone,” Aave’s Kulechov said. “People need to just pay the 160 gwei [gas fee] to keep prices up to date.”      MakerDAO was undoubtedly the biggest loser on Thursday. An infrastructure error led to over $4 million being swooped up by a lurking bot-maker, leaving investors high and dry as their collateral was taken away. In response, the Maker community voted Friday to restructure certain risk measures.      DeFi exchange bZx also halted opening new trades and loans and will leave these features offline until an audit is conducted, said Bean. bZx recently switched to Chainlink following a flash loan attack that relied on manipulated pricing data. All Chainlink oracles are reporting as of press time.      “The issue is that data providers can’t provide timely updates. I can query the current rate, but it’s way off from [the] actual market rate,” Bean said.      In an email, Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov told CoinDesk that “unique market conditions created temporary congestion” on the ethereum mainnet. He said the congestion has been reduced, and all Chainlink oracles, which pull from multiple pricing feeds themselves, are now reporting accurately.      Still, other DeFi applications handled the surge of transactions without heavy-handed measures.      Decentralized exchange Uniswap saw its all-time trade volume double to over $53 million, according to a tweet from Uniswap founder Hayden Adams.      Kyber Network also set an all time high with some $30 million in 24-hour trade volume, according to CoinGecko.      What does this all mean? DeFi didn’t die, but it didn’t thrive either.      ""If we want crypto to become a global asset class, we need better DeFi [infrastructure],"" Multicoin Capital managing partner Kyle Samani tweeted Friday. ""The status quo is not sufficient by orders of magnitude.""",NEGATIVE,없음,ETH | LINK | MARKET | TRADING | UNI,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/03/13/thursdays-market-madness-strained-ethereums-killer-app-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f235d43e963800455a3a8537c7e5073e5f5cf8b3-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431631,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4Pph,1584132307,Bitcoin Ekes Out Gains but Remains in Red Amid Broader Market Rebound,"Bitcoin (BTC) recovered slightly from Thursday’s brutal selloff as global financial markets creep back into the green.       After dipping below $4,000, the world’s leading cryptocurrency posted some gains and is currently trading at $5,431 as of 20:00 UTC Friday. While bitcoin is still down 15 percent over the last 24 hours, traders started buying after it hit a 12-month low of $3,855 around 02:00 UTC on Coinbase.      On the one hand, the timing of the turnaround supports the notion that bitcoin is more correlated with traditional markets than its advocates have long believed.       “The rally from the low coincided with a turn in the equities market,” noted Max Boonen, CEO of B2C2, a London-based over-the-counter (OTC) market maker.      Indeed, Japan’s Nikkei 225 Index chart shows green candles, a sign there are more buyers than sellers, appearing at 02:00 UTC, around the time of the buying on Coinbase. Equities in other markets are seeing gains, as in the U.S. the S&P 500 is up 9 percent as of 20:00 UTC.      On the other hand, the U.S. Federal Reserve's New York branch announced a $1.5 trillion injection of cash into the financial systems Thursday, and that news had traders thinking bitcoin still has major potential as an inflation haven even though in trying times cash and a steady diet of government bonds seems to be what people want.      “Eventually, as QE washes the globe with more fiat, BTC will come into its own. The fundamental reason why BTC exists is even more strong now,” said Jack Tan of algorithmic trading firm Kronos Research, referring to the quantitative easing policies employed by central bankers since the 2008 financial crisis.      Cryptocurrency whales, those with large stakes, seem to be moving coins around more often than usual, as Binance saw 1,702 BTC of inflows March 8 while bitcoin’s price was still up near $8,000. Since then, a tumble downward has left bitcoin in a $4,600 to $5,900 range, and some are salivating at a buying opportunity.      “Traders of all types - institutional, prosumer, retail and everyone in between - are taking advantage of value investing opportunities in an oversold market that is fundamentally sound and ripe for recovery in the not-too-distant future,” said Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Bequant, a London-based digital asset firm.      Trading in other leading cryptocurrencies, such as ether (ETH), down 6 percent, and XRP (XRP), in the red 6 percent over the last 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC, indicates uncertainty is still the name of the game.      “We expect prices to recover, though the current geopolitical environment and evolving coronavirus outbreak make the timing and size of that recovery a bit uncertain,” Bequant’s Vinokourov added.      Traders always struggle to time the market, and cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile. They want to buy in at these prices, but are keeping a close eye on bitcoin’s gyrations.      Henrik Kugelberg, an active OTC trader based in Sweden, is busy making cryptocurrency purchases. However, he cautioned that U.S. President Donald Trump’s often mercurial decision-making could throw a spanner in the works.      “I bought some more today. However, Trump’s cards have not all been seen yet, so it is likely we’ll see another [bitcoin] drop,” Kugelberg said.",NEUTRAL,BTC | XRP,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/13/bitcoin-ekes-out-gains-but-remains-in-red-amid-broader-market-rebound,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/38f08274b4f3abcd5b100aa7fe020a3010c04115-988x724.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431620,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4PNh,1584130505,"Despite Bitcoin Price Dips, Crypto Is a Safe Haven in the Middle East","Although it’s difficult to quantify demand for bitcoin (BTC) in informal markets across the Middle East, small-scale traders from Lebanon to Yemen say interest in bitcoin as a safe-haven asset, not a speculative asset, is stronger than ever.      Rami Mohammad Ali, a bitcoin miner and trader based in the Palestinian area of East Jerusalem, said the sell side of the local peer-to-peer market dried up and the buy side exploded in March.      So far, he’s sold a cumulative total of 30 bitcoin to 90 customers. That’s a significant increase from September 2019, when he said he sold roughly 20 bitcoin a month to 50 customers.      The appeal of holding value in bitcoin, he said, is that people can access “the money any time they need it.”      This appears to be true across the region. One anonymous Syrian trader with family in Lebanon said small Lebanese business owners are struggling to pay their invoices abroad. So, among the few Lebanese with family abroad and the necessary computer skills, some now “buy [bitcoin] locally with cash and liquidate it abroad through friends and family to pay their invoices.”      In fact, some Middle Eastern bitcoin traders reported relative newbies are learning quickly and looking to buy bitcoin this week, as global prices dip.      Read more: Why Energy Experts Are Watching Crypto as Oil Wars Emerge      Meanwhile, in Tehran, an anonymous Iranian bitcoiner said people now “tend to keep their assets in gold, dollars and housing, plus a little bitcoin.” Due to the coronavirus outbreak in Iran, the economic situation has gotten progressively worse. This means fewer public bitcoin meetups and quieter trades among a population with even less faith in national institutions. Small-scale bitcoin mining is now commonplace, locals say, despite the challenges faced by industrial operations.      “Bitcoin is a revolutionary product but it needs a few more revolutions,” the Tehran-based bitcoiner said. “In the past, people thought bitcoin was a new type of scam. Now bitcoin is more trusted.”      The analytics firm Gate Trade estimated there are now more than 30 Iranian companies using bitcoin, instead of fiat, for cross-border deals. But a Gate Trade spokesperson declined to specify which companies because the greatest barrier to bitcoin adoption in the Middle East appears to be international sanctions. That challenge isn’t limited to Iran.      Read more: How Lebanon’s Economic Crisis Highlights Bitcoin’s Limitations      Yemeni bitcoin trader Mohammed Alsobhi said roughly five civilians continue to buy a small amount of bitcoin each month. The bitcoin market in Yemen is much smaller and quieter than most in the region due to the widespread censorship of telecommunication networks. But there is interest among locals knowledgeable about computer science.      ""If I had the capabilities available in developed countries, I would have made great progress in this field,"" Alsobhi said of selling bitcoin in his war-torn nation. ""Most companies that deal globally … are excluding Yemen.""      He said he hopes people in Yemen will gain access to crypto markets for trading opportunities. But, he added, war is the biggest barrier to bitcoin adoption in his country because of sanctions. For example, due to compliance concerns, he said people in Yemen cannot download wallets via Google Play.      Crypto-curious civilians are barred from the system as the sanction’s collateral damage.    Sanctions' impact    Yemen offers a microcosm of the global challenges civilians face using decentralized monetary networks.      Stepping back, a currency war emerged from Yemen’s civil war between Iran-backed Houthi rebels, which conquered the former capital city of Sana’a, and the Saudi-aligned Central Bank of Yemen, now in Aden. Yemenites don’t trust either side. Yemeni activist Tawakkol Karman recently accused President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi of being just another pawn under “the Saudi occupation.”      As such, sanctions have ripple effects for civilians trapped between failing banks and warring parties. Yemen’s United Nations representative, Abdullah Al-Saadi, accused the Houthi militants of consorting with the ultimate target of U.S. sanctions, the armed forces of Iran.      “The militias continue to welcome Iranian experts and receive military support and weapons from Iran,” Al-Saadi said in a U.N. Security Council meeting in February.      With widespread reports of Houthi looting and the ongoing humanitarian crisis, the idea of digital cash appeals to some tech-savvy Yemenites in urban areas.      “Most of the population of Yemen is in [Houthi]-controlled areas, and are engaged in the bulk of economic activity in the country,” said Hassan Al-Haifi, an ex-banker based in Sana’a. “Cryptocurrency or e-money could help Yemenites under a formidable siege and blockade. … Sana'a would be favorable to a more autonomous currency regime.”      Read more: Notes From the WEF: Oil-Producing Nations Want Dollar Alternatives, Just Not Bitcoin      Ben Freeman, a former Goldman Sachs oil trader and CEO of Creo Commodities, said cryptocurrency’s value in the region relies on being decentralized and censorship-resistant. He doesn’t believe bitcoin’s current volatility has any impact on that value proposition, especially in light of the risk Yemen’s civil war presents for Saudi Arabian oil production.      “Extreme market sell-offs generally hit most asset classes as assets are sold to generate collateral for losing positions,” Freeman said. “If institutions break down, and bitcoin is independent to any institution or government oversight, then we’ll start to see more flight to bitcoin as an asset class.”      The hurdles preventing local adoption in the Middle East aren’t the lack of opportunity or demand; they are primarily the byproduct of political conditions. In Yemen and Iran, bitcoiners may need to avoid both domestic and international compliance risks. Most fintech companies overlook Lebanon and the Palestinian territories, even without sanctions. As such, there are few comprehensive or clear datasets related to usage beyond global (and heavily regulated) crypto exchanges.      This makes local markets hard to quantify. Still, it doesn’t appear that broader market dips reduced demand on the ground for over-the-counter (OTC) trades. Institutional players fleeing bitcoin have little impact on demand from grassroots Middle Eastern networks. To the contrary, lower prices present an opportunity for buyers in emerging markets.      “Bitcoin transactions in Iran increased [in 2020], compared to previous years,” the Tehran-based bitcoiner said. “But the slope seems gentle.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | COMMODITY | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/03/13/despite-bitcoin-price-dips-crypto-is-a-safe-haven-in-the-middle-east,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a588834d78301d3df3cec84b663f56879001027f-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431630,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4Pjh,1584127124,Crypto Prepped Before Coronavirus Went Global,"Market meltdowns, a failure of leadership at both the state and corporate level and a disruption to human civility are all built into the crypto mindset following the recession of 2007-2008. It explains why the relatively small enclave of Crypto Twitter was weeks ahead of the global pandemic, with crypto’s thought leaders urging people to prepare for the worst.      Now that the worst is here, these harbingers of doom feel vindicated.      “The word you're looking for to describe those tech Twitter personalities who you spent the last month mocking and who have been proven right on CV-19 is ‘Cassandra,’” Nic Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures and lover of the classics, tweeted yesterday.      Once-trusted sources of information, from media to presidents and prime ministers as well as international health organizations, have all failed in preparing the world for Coronavirus. And now, the call to “decentralize or die” has never taken on a more literal meaning.      “Most companies in the [crypto] space have become relatively quicker to react and prepare for the virus than some other industries,” said Anil Lulla, a founder of Delphi Digital, said in a direct message.      Twitter, crypto’s public square, has helped reinforce the need for decisive action ahead of the pandemic, with prominent voices like Ryan Selkis of Messari sounding the alarm early and often. Selkis wrote on Feb 8 about why the virus could be a big deal, and set company work from home policies March 3, well before most businesses, crypto or otherwise, had taken that step.      To some extent, this skepticism of centralized systems has better prepared crypto firms and proponents for what lies ahead. Despite the anxiety rampant on social media, when queried individuals in the crypto sphere are treating the coronavirus pandemic as a “Life Changes! Be Ready” event.      See also: How to Survive the Coronavirus and Keep Your Startup Alive      “Bitcoiners don’t seem fazed much,” said Christian Langalis, who works for Urbit but gained prominence as Bitcoin Sign Guy.      The preparedness mindset and crypto have long had close ideological associations, said John Ramey, former Innovation Adviser to the Obama White House and founder of The Prepared, a site with a full-on guide to getting ready for the worst. The Prepared is a likely onramp for people looking for information on how to wait-out a crisis.      “People drawn to crypto don’t believe in central government fiat currencies, and recognize the risks in our institutions and systems,” he said. “That spirit is alive in the preparedness community. It’s two sides of the same coin.”      Ramey has a three-point set of guidelines to prepare for any contingency. First, and most important, is for people to get their personal finances in order. Stocking up on food and essential goods and learning how to medicate yourself are secondary and tertiary (though still essential) concerns.    That spirit is alive in the preparedness community. It’s two sides of the same coin.    “Even if you have to move quickly in an acute event, there is value in keeping cash aside if you have a choice to do so,” Ramey said. “You have to be ready for the cascading economic effects.”      Personal finance is a key concern for coiners; in fact, it’s the bedrock of the industry. “What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party,” Satoshi, bitcoin’s unknown creator, said when introducing the idea of the first trustless digital currency.      Norwegian bitcoiner Hodlonaut said, “I have done very little really [to prepare for the coronavirus.] Norwegian society is pretty robust, it’s hard to see that food supply will become an issue and we have very high quality tap water in unlimited supply.”      See also: Bitcoiners Are Biohacking a DIY Coronavirus Vaccine      “I just hodl my bitcoin (BTC) like always,” he added.      Likewise, Ramey said that people rushing out to buy toilet paper and hand sanitizers “aren’t preparing, they’re reacting.”      “People can come into preparedness from different angles, but it all boils down to understanding the world is fragile and the responsibility is on you,” Ramey said.    Financial sovereignty    Hector Rosekrans, client advisor for bitcoin software firm Casa, is building systems that allow people to maintain control over their money in times of financial crisis.      “While COVID-19 can impact operations at centralized custodians, self custody is not impacted,” he said. “With certain multisig setups you can safely keep a key at home, without risk losing funds in a physical attack.”      Concentration risk is something Anil Lulla is facing head on, as he lives with two of his Delphi Digital business partners. “Our apartment has severe concentration risk as far as our business goes,” he said. “We're all trying to social distance from other people to the best of our abilities and have stocked up on a month of food supplies as well as medicine.”      He also said they’re taking measures to self-medicate in the event one of them gets sick, to not take up hospital space or medical attention that could better serve someone else.      Likewise, Amber Baldet, CEO of Clovyr, said she’s taking precautions to limit the spread of the coronavirus in her Brooklyn, NY community. “I work with financial risk, and my family works with technical risk. We’re generally risk-averse people,” she said. As a young and healthy adult she said she will likely be spared the worst of the coronavirus’ effects, though she’s staying home and cancelling a trip to New York in order to mitigate the spread of the virus.      See also: Bitcoiners in Europe Reflect on Economic Shocks as Coronavirus Spreads      Many, like Jake Chervinsky, counsel for decentralized finance startup Compound, have seen little disruption to their daily habits – except more frequent handwashing.      “Luckily, I often work from home since our office is in [San Francisco] and I'm based in [Washington] D.C.,” Chervinksy said. “I wouldn't say I'm exactly self-quarantining at this point, but I'm prepared to do so if necessary.”      Compound instituted a ""remote-encouraged"" policy and has begun cancelling non-essential in-person meetings this week, he said.    Flatten the curve!    The phrase “flattening the curve” has also had viral spread. The idea is to slow transmission rates through quarantining and social distancing, Ramey said, thereby limiting the chance the healthcare system gets overloaded.      “I’ve been self-quarantined for basically a week [and] told everyone I knew to stock up over a month ago,” Nic Carter said over Telegram. “The U.S. is on a trajectory to become Lombardy/Wuhan within a couple weeks so it’ll happen regardless.”      Still, Carter questions the assumption that the economy’s health should come before public health, as some in traditional finance have been arguing. “The economy is downstream from the virus, which could kill millions – a down economy probably wouldn’t.”      Carter thinks the virus is a ""black swan"" event that was due to disrupt debt-bloated markets, probably for the better. It’s what attracted him to the currency in the first place.      “Bitcoin’s primary critique is against phony markets,” Christian Langalis said. “That it was a virus which served as the pin seems fitting given our highly internationalized economy.”      “When one blows up spectacularly, it really just confirms the thesis,” he said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/13/crypto-prepped-before-coronavirus-went-global,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/36c7203a4c29a1bb0ad6164bd3dc12bfadeae7f1-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431622,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4Pbh,1584124148,MakerDAO Debts Grow as DeFi Leader Moves to Stabilize Protocol,"MakerDAO’s emergency shutdown option – which was weighed by community members following the appearance of a $4 million debt bubble on the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform – will not pass at this time. If a shutdown was triggered by the Maker team, all dai stablecoins in circulation would convert to the underlying asset, ether (ETH).      A flaw in Maker’s system for generating collateralized debt positions (CDPs) caused some $4 million in ether to be swiped up for free. This was caused by network congestion on the Ethereum network and Maker’s pricing oracles failing to update quickly enough.      The amount of debt on the Maker platform continues to rise, however, hitting nearly $5.7 million as of press time Friday.      This is likely caused by high chain congestion on Ethereum and the inability to add collateral to positions on Maker. Gas prices on the Ethereum mainnet continued to increase in the early UTC hours Friday, with prices hitting 200 Gwei, according to data site Eth Gas Station.      Read more: DeFi Leader MakerDAO Weighs Emergency Shutdown Following ETH Price Drop      In an executive vote Friday, the Maker team is expected to address three pressing issues following Thursday’s turmoil: the dai peg, system debt and debt auctions. The 12 listed proposals MKR holders voted on were intended to normalize the platform’s operations.      Regardless of chain congestion, people with dai loans have poured ETH into the Maker protocol to shore up positions that could be undercollateralized if another drop in ETH’s value were to hit.      Those not able to get collateral into the system to cover their loans were forcefully liquidated by the protocol, however.      In an earlier vote Friday, the MakerDAO community voted to adjust the system’s risk parameters. Though the move comes in the wake of a dramatic 30 percent drop in ETH’s price, the changes were first discussed during a March 5 governance call.      The voting ballot was first issued Friday at 4:30 UTC and passed three hours later, according to the Maker Foundation. The vote can be executed 24 hours after passage, or 7:30 UTC on March 14.      The ballot’s content includes measures to increase the supply of dai on the market, which experienced a squeeze given market demand. Indeed, the demand for dai was reflected in the stablecoin’s interest rate reaching 22 percent Thursday on the second-largest DeFi platform, Compound.      Maker will also print new MKR governance tokens to refund CDPs that lost funds Thursday with the stated goal of returning dai to its dollar peg, according to a Maker Foundation blog post.      DeFi entrepreneur Ryan Berckmans described the action as a “haircut” for MKR holders in the spirit of the DeFi platform's white paper.      “During a Debt Auction, MKR is minted by the system (increasing the amount of MKR in circulation), and then sold to bidders for Dai,” the white paper states.      Both investment firm Paradigm and venture-backed DeFi startup Dharma have announced intentions to help Maker through the debt crisis by purchasing the newly printed MKR.      “MKR buyers should prepare for sustained high gas prices, and downward pressure on ETH and MKR,” Berckmans said in a summary of the March 12 call. “We should plan for global markets to potentially crash further, which may correlate with further crypto drops.”      Overall, MakerDAO stakeholders are now focused on returning dai to its 1:1 peg with the U.S. dollar after investors rushed to the stablecoin as a safe haven.      The stablecoin shot as high as $1.22 per token yesterday and has since fallen to $0.98, according to CoinGecko. Data providers CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko and Messari all show dai’s price hitting an all-time high Thursday.      The peg was last discussed in the March 5 governance call.      “Major swings in ETH price are what is going to determine a lot of what happens with migration and with dai price,” Maker community member Vishesh said during the March 5 call.",NEGATIVE,ETH | MKR,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | MKR | TRADING,"William Foxley, Brady Dale",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/03/13/makerdao-debts-grow-as-defi-leader-moves-to-stabilize-protocol,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/309c2046e1df0c882ad84e6a5959ef873279610c-1500x998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431627,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4Pnh,1584117342,Whale Watching: Exchange Data Contained Early Warning of Thursday's Bitcoin Dump,"The big drop in bitcoin’s (BTC) price Thursday was in the making since March 8, data on the flow of funds into exchanges indicates.      The biggest cryptocurrency by market value collapsed from $7,900 to a 10-month low of $4,700 on Thursday and extended the decline to 12-month lows below $3,900 early Friday.      Data provided by blockchain analysis firm CryptoQuant shows inflows into major exchanges, or deposits, began rising at higher-than-usual rate beginning March 8. One way to read this is as a possible co-ordinated action by whales to dump the cryptocurrency.     X-axis represents the block number, a proxy for time  The left side Y-axis is bitcoin's price.  The right side Y-axis is the number of incoming coins into all exchanges.    Coins began flowing into exchanges at a faster rate starting from block number 620.8K, mined on March 8. Prior to that block, the average inflow per transaction was about 1,000 BTC. But after that, inflows ranged from 1.500 to 6,000 BTC in the run-up to Thursday’s price drop.      Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency’s slide began with a near 10 percent drop on March 8. In the following three days, BTC posted marginal losses – before plunging by a staggering 39 percent on Thursday      The implication is that whales – individuals, or entities, that hold large amounts of digital currencies – started moving coins from wallets to exchanges at least four days in advance of the dump.      A similar pattern can be seen at the world’s largest exchange, Binance. Prior to 620.817K, the average inflow per block was about 100 BTC. After that point in time, inflows ranged from 130 to 1,702 BTC in almost every block.      Notably, that huge inflow of 1,702 BTC was observed in block number 620.965 when bitcoin’s price was trading near $8,000.      Again, the data suggests big players had begun preparing for the massive liquidation since March 8.      Similarly, inflows into BitMEX fluctuated between 97 and 1,994 BTC from block numbers 620.8K to 621.3K.      One transaction, for 1,000 BTC, was recorded in block number 621,256 when bitcoin’s price was hovering around $7,900.    Lead indicator?    It is doubtful anybody could have predicted the magnitude of the sell-off seen on Thursday. That said, the increased inflow of BTC into exchanges was a sign the big sellers were getting ready to offload their holdings, which usually translates into big price slide.      The lesson: Keeping a close eye on inflows into exchanges can help leveraged traders avoid getting trapped on the wrong side of the market.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/13/whale-watching-exchange-data-contained-early-warning-of-thursdays-bitcoin-dump,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8a0e5c5b4be662f6998622efbeaeed12b1fff67e-1725x1093.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As a result, our sales have dramatically increased over the last couple of weeks as a reaction to the pandemic,” she said. “We expect to see this continue over the next several weeks as people transition to a remote work schedule and prepare for COVID-19.”      Safeway, one of Lolli’s partners, operates 894 locations across 17 states including California and Washington, which are developing epicenters for the virus. Lolli, which rewards online customers in satoshis, also has arrangements with restaurant delivery applications Postmates and Caviar, as well as PetSmart, which offers a pet food delivery service.      Strike by Zap, a lightning implementation currently running in beta, nearly shut down after its payments increased beyond expectation. Jack Mallers, Zap CEO, said the wallet “crushed its all-time-highs last week,” after processing over a bitcoin’s worth of transactions.    It’s a rally all over, from Latin America to South Korea.    Mallers said the startup, which launched in late-January, expected to settle about a bitcoin worth of transactions per month.      “We were not prepared to do this much volume. I had to make emergency phone calls to our trading counterparties to make sure the app wouldn’t crash,” Mallers said.      Strike works by converting and settling bitcoin payments on behalf of merchants, so retail outlets never have to “touch” the asset. This means Strike is “inherently short bitcoin” for every payment made through the app. Using live trading algorithms to keep its exposure flat, Mallers set automatic borrowing limits with its OTC desks to cover these short positions, which when exceeded would block users from completing their transactions.      “These are people stocking up, buying gift cards to Walmart and CVS,” Mallers said. He added that the uptick is “contextually related to Coronavirus beyond [market] volatility.”      “When bitcoin volatility is to the upside, maybe people increase their spending – people generating wealth have a tendency to spend it – but the reverse is usually not the case,” he said.      Fold, another crypto payments startup with lightning integrations, has experienced inventory issues since February, Will Reeves, Fold CEO, said. “Most of the activity has been focused on prepping,” he said, with many users stocking up on first aid and other supplies on sites like Amazon, Lowes, and Cabela's.      He added, “some users have mentioned that the contactless nature of Fold payments versus contaminated physical cash and credit cards has made them feel safer for the first time.”      ZenGo, a Tel Aviv-based wallet startup with customers in 70 countries, has also seen record volumes of people buying crypto and using it for remittance, according to chief executive Oriel Ohayon.      The increase in users “started early this week,” he said. However, Ohayon isn’t positive this is caused by the coronavirus or is part of a growth trend that began in January.      See also: Mass Surveillance Threatens Personal Privacy Amid Coronavirus      Still, transactions using the non-custodial wallet surged 300 percent week-over-week, Ohayon said. “We do not know where and how funds are sent, but we have a sense via support [tickets] and others that people use it to store bitcoin and send remittances.”      “It’s a rally all over, from South Latin America to South Korea,” Ohayon said. “I think there is a global pattern here.”      Sergej Kotliar, CEO of Bitrefill, another popular non-custodial payments channel, said, “it's very hard for us to notice a trend [in panic buying,] especially with any scientific level of evidence.”      Other crypto payment rails may also be seeing a boost, though their privacy protecting and distributed attributes make it impossible to determine. Such as Mallers’s other lightning implementation, Zap, which is unable to track transactions.      “A bigger impact to us than people sitting home is the volatility in the bitcoin price,” Kotiar said. A drop in bitcoin price historically leads to a temporary increase in transactions. Though, Kotiar said, if prices remain depressed – after that initial surge in transactions – use of the app will level off.      See also: Makeup Mogul Michelle Phan’s Coronavirus Strategy Is Educate and HODL Bitcoin      “People spend significantly less on purchases when bitcoin is low,” he said.      Likewise, BTCPay, a payments processor touted for its secure, private, and censorship-resistant features has likely seen a burst of user activity, but its founders are unable to confirm.      “BTCPay is self-hosted software and we don't collect data on users or their transactions,” Pavlenex, a pseudonymous BTCPay contributor, said.      While a boon to her startup, Lolli communications director Strobel reminds users, “no one knows how long this pandemic will last and what the micro and macro effects will be.”      But “the principles of bitcoin still remain true,” she said. “Nothing about bitcoin has changed.”      Note: this story has been updated with additional comment from Will Reeves at Fold.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/13/bitcoin-shopping-gets-a-boost-from-social-distancing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/90efe2b8edf1d49268f0cd708c65d7d26d77cf5c-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431613,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4PLh,1584103250,Defining Cryptocurrency Is the Best Way to Kill It,"William Mougayar, a CoinDesk columnist, is the author of “The Business Blockchain,” producer of the Token Summit and a venture investor and adviser.      We should stop trying to define or classify cryptocurrency as if it were a beast from another planet. Rather, we just need to accept it as the future of money. It is a currency, not a security, and it shouldn't be governed by securities laws. The dollar, euro, yuan, pound are not regulated by securities authorities.      ​There is little value in attempting to define, box-in, segment or categorize cryptocurrency as something that needs to be continuously examined, questioned and analyzed. Instead, let’s focus on promoting cryptocurrency’s adoption because it is here to flourish and stay.      At a recent DLD 2020 panel, entitled ""Virtual Currencies & the Global Financial System,"" the first question from the moderator consisted of “defining cryptocurrencies.” Each of the three panelists (painfully) took a shot at suggesting their own definitions. Another panel from Davos 2020, ""From Token Assets to a Token Economy,"" discussed tokens as a type of cryptocurrency. In both panels, the definitions tried to depict tokens and cryptocurrency as a new type of animal.      Is there a point trying to classify the various types of cryptocurrencies, really?      See also: While We Wait for Laws, We Need Better Interpretations of Existing Regulation      Cryptocurrency is just like any currency, except with more powerful properties. It is that degree of power that is scaring incumbents while exciting new participants.      Over the long term and in the end-state, cryptocurrency is going to be as pervasively used as today’s currency, but with a rivaling variety. Today we see cryptocurrency as the future of money, but tomorrow it will be an integral part of money.      Email was new until it wasn’t. E-commerce was a novelty until it no longer was. Filing taxes electronically or renewing licenses online was a rarity until it became routine and sometimes the only option. Online banking was innovative until it became routine. Meeting friends online was extraordinary until it became very common. Reading online news was a parallel activity to printed newspapers until it became the norm for billions of people.      Today, cryptocurrency is an anomaly whose usage and understanding are in the hands of the few. Soon enough, it will permeate our society, habits, business, government, and become second nature.    The rabbit hole of classifications    If you go down the rabbit hole of classifications, you quickly realize the resulting madness and confusion from the nomenclature jargon: stablecoins, staked currency, utility tokens, security tokens, native coins, digital rights tokens, non-fungible tokens, etc.      There are stablecoins and market-driven coins. Stablecoins, like the name implies are coins with less volatility (supported by algorithmic or asset-backing stability), whereas non-stablecoins are subject to market supply/demand price fluctuations.      Cryptocurrency can be government or non-government backed. Government-backed cryptocurrency is still a rarity, and the subject of more discussion than action. As an aside, it will end up as a centrally controlled digital currency rather than being decentralized, programmable and native to a given blockchain.    Sadly, we have invented many of these classifications to please regulators.    We also have tokens that are in essence cryptocurrencies with a purpose. Then we enter the legal sphere, where tokens get labeled a utility, or security, based on how they were initially created, who received them and their ultimate functionality. For most tokens, there is a blurred line in demarcating the distinction between exclusive utility and their security-like properties of tokens.      Somewhere between a utility and security, we also have non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that are representations of unique ownership of a digital asset that has no physical equivalent (such as a CryptoKitty or a games related artifact like a special tank or sword.)      Sadly, we have invented many of these classifications to please regulators. With tokens, regulators and governments get agitated because companies can now issue tokens as currency, whereas issuing money used to be the sole right of sovereign governments. But companies have been issuing stock for decades. A stock is another form of value that cryptographic tokens mimic when they function as a security.      Then, we enter discussions about the functionality of these tokens: can they be earned? Sold? Bought? Spent? Awarded? Are they a payment unit? Or a right to a privileged action (like voting or getting access to information). Will their value increase if you don’t use them and just store them? Are they native to a blockchain network, or grafted on top of an existing platform or singular application?      The above classifications are what we currently see, and there may be new representations we haven’t seen yet. While some of these functions are distinct from one another, many of them overlap with each other. That is why classifying cryptocurrency is not that useful, because we are still in the formation stages.    Reality check. Stop defining.    Time for a reality check. Do we still attempt to define the internet? Not anymore. But in its early days, we did…until we didn’t anymore.      Do we define money by its use cases, like something you buy groceries or pay a toll with? Or do we, rather, define money by its properties?      See also: Cut the Consensus: You Can’t Run a Business Like a Blockchain      Money’s key properties consist of being a unit and a store of value that is transferable, fungible, verifiable, divisible and scarce.      Cryptocurrency inherits all these properties, in addition to adding unique functions that money doesn’t have: its immutability is digital (the physical is gone), it can be fungible or non-fungible, its policy governance doesn’t need to be centralized, it has very powerful programmable capabilities with imbedded logic (if-this-then-that), and its transferability is peer-to-peer (without central intermediaries). In essence, cryptocurrency is money on steroids.      Let us start using cryptocurrency according to its most common features first, the ones that it shares with the money we know. Then we can evolve from there. Just like early websites were glorified brochures on a screen, then we evolved way beyond that monochromatic use case into e-commerce, e-business, two-way communications, social interactions and much more.      Using cryptocurrency hasn’t been easy for the average person, and that’s a valid challenge. But it is getting better.      It is time to give cryptocurrency the place it deserves. If it is to claim a position as the new money, then we need to increase its usage, starting with the easier use cases and gradually increasing the variety and complexity.      We need to bring cryptocurrencies to the fore and make them as popular as regular currency and web are.      Let us stop defining and segmenting cryptocurrency in ways that limit it. Rather, let’s start using it in ways that open up the possibilities and allow it to cement itself in our lives and businesses so it is accepted, welcomed and not feared.

42431619,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4PVh,1584103043,Coinbase Moves to Cut Blockchain Load With Bitcoin Batching,"San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has started grouping multiple bitcoin transactions together, rather than issuing sends one by one.      The adoption of ""batching,"" the firm said in a blog post Thursday, will mean less strain is put on the Bitcoin blockchain from large numbers of transactions arising from the popular exchange. The move will further reduce transaction fees for customers, according to the post.      ""We anticipate that this will reduce our load on the Bitcoin network by more than 50 percent, and the network fees our customers pay will automatically be reduced by an equivalent amount when sending,"" wrote Eli Haims, Coinbase product manager.      Batching is already live, with the firm warning that it will add a ""small delay"" in sends being broadcast to the network, but will not impact the time it takes for users' transactions to be confirmed.      The change will have its effect by reducing the number of transaction that need to be processed by the many, but still limited, number of computers supporting the network. In times of high use, bitcoin can become congested, with users needing to pay higher fees in order to get their transactions verified.      Historically, when bitcoin's price is peaking, the market becomes more busy and fees often rise in conjunction. Fees have been stable and relatively low since last year, but peaked to record levels as bitcoin rose to an all-time high in late 2017.      Notably, the recent turmoil in the markets prompted by the coronavirus' potential hit on the global economy has seen a sharp rise in fees, apparently as investors and traders moved in large numbers to liquidate their holdings.      According to data from Byte Tree shared in a tweet, transaction fees on average over the last five weeks were around 74 U.S. cents, but an hourly average sometime Thursday saw that climb to almost $2 on average.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/13/coinbase-moves-to-cut-blockchain-load-with-bitcoin-batching,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/32bdcc1974cb1fb15d2fcf27d896d4adbbdc1e18-1500x895.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431624,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4Pdh,1584097682,Bitcoin Price Briefly Dips to 12-Month Low in Overnight Trading,"Bitcoin (BTC) has made a quick bounce from a dip to below $4,000 seen early on Friday.      The cryptocurrency is currently trading near $5,415, up around 40 percent from the low of $3,867 reached around 02:15 UTC. That was the lowest level since March 25, 2019, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      Equity markets are also flashing green alongside the slight recovery for bitcoin.      S&P 500 futures are currently reporting more than 3 percent gains, while the Euro Stoxx 50 index – the eurozone’s benchmark index – has added more than 2 percent to its value.      Asian markets had gapped lower at the open, tracking the overnight losses on Wall Street, but recovered a major portion of the losses before the closing bell.    Year-to-date losses    While bitcoin’s recovery looks impressive, the cryptocurrency is still down by more than $2,000 from levels near $8,000 seen early on Thursday.      Bitcoin is now reporting a 27 percent loss on a year-to-date basis after showing gains of 46 percent just a month ago when the cryptocurrency was trading near $10,500.      Back then, bitcoin was outshining gold by a notable margin, as the yellow metal was flashing a 6 percent gain for 2020. However, as of March 13, gold is back on top with a 7.5 percent year-to-date gain.      The yearly gains were shed as the cryptocurrency plummeted by nearly 39 percent on Thursday during the relentless coronavirus-led sell-off in risk assets. The resulting liquidity crisis was accentuated by a massive long squeeze (forced liquidations) on prominent crypto derivatives exchanges such as BitMEX.    Corrective bounce?    Bitcoin’s sudden crash to $3,867 from $8,000 looked overstretched as per technical studies.      “The latest bitcoin correction has pushed BTC to oversold levels last seen in September 2019 and November 2019,” co-founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital Jason A. Williams tweeted today.      Indeed, the widely tracked relative strength index (RSI), which oscillates between zero to 100, had dropped to 15 – the lowest since November 2018. A below-30 reading indicates the cryptocurrency is oversold.      As a result, the rise seen over the last few hours could be an “oversold bounce,"" which occurs when investors view a preceding sell-off as too severe and ease selling pressure by squaring off short positions.    Focus on risk sentiment    “Bitcoin will regain poise with risk assets, which will start seeing a sustainable recovery once there is stabilization in the coronavirus infection curve,” Mike Alfred, co-founder, and CEO of Digital Assets Data told CoinDesk.      As per the latest reports, coronavirus continues to spread in Europe and the U.S. Therefore, the current uptick in the equity markets could be a chart-driven bounce or investors may have taken heart from the Federal Reserve’s decision to inject $1.4 trillion worth of liquidity into the financial system.      If the recovery gathers momentum during the U.S. trading hours, bitcoin could very well find acceptance above $6,000 once more.      However, as long as the virus outbreak shows no signs of slowing down, the risk of further downside moves in equities and bitcoin would remain high.      Still, dips below $5,000 would be transient, according to Alfred, as there is too much fundamental demand from long-term holders – investors who bought bitcoins before the massive rally from $6,000 to $20,000 seen in the fourth quarter of 2017 and during the last five weeks of 2018.      Currently, there are 12.19 million addresses that acquired coins below $5,700, according to blockchain intelligence firm IntoTheBlock.      These players could increase their exposure on price drops below $5,000, especially with the miners' reward halving (a bitcoin supply cut) due in two months.      Alfred said the price range of $2,500 to $5,000 offers incredible value for investors.    Bottom in?    The bear market, which began at the end of 2013, ran out of steam at the 200-week average in 2015. Back then, the average was placed near $220.      The sell-off from the record high of $20,000 reached in December 2017 also ended at the 200-week MA in December 2018.      The long lower wick attached to the current weekly candle suggests seller exhaustion below the 200-week average. If history is a guide, bitcoin looks to have found a bottom below $4,000.      That does not necessarily imply a v-shaped recovery to $10,000. If the equities resume their sell-off, prices might revisit sub-$5,000 levels.

42431615,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4PRh,1584094506,Investors Can Hedge Long-Term Risk With New 2-Year Bitcoin Derivatives,"Quedex, a Gibraltar-regulated derivatives exchange, recently launched a bitcoin contract with the longest expiration date in crypto.      The CEO of Quedex Bitcoin Derivatives Exchange, Wiktor Gromniak, told CoinDesk the firm had experienced a surge in investor interest in its new BTCUSD contract, which expires in December 2021 and only became tradable last Friday.      Quedex volumes surged past a record $5 million on Saturday, beating the previous all-time high of $2 million reached in February, according to the exchange.      ""The new December 2021 products account for about 5 to 15 percent of total volume on the exchange ... we see it as relatively high and promising for a product which [has been] live for less than a week,"" Gromniak said. ""What's interesting is that the new December 2021 expiry options are the most popular among options products.""      Quedex's total volumes peaked at over $16 million between March 6 and March 13, more than the exchange's $9.8 million weekly average. Over the same timeframe, volumes for the December 2021 contracts came in at $1.2 million with most activity taking place on Thursday, where volumes peaked at nearly $900,000, according to Gromniak.      Operating since 2016, Quedex is regulated by the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission and offers various bitcoin-denominated products. As well as the two-year product, the exchange also offers contracts with expiries ranging from a week, to a month, to a quarter. Clients can also use a margin trading facility that comes with up to 10 times leverage.      The new contract's launch came before the coronavirus pandemic triggered mass sell-offs across both traditional and crypto markets. Contrary to the widely held safe-haven narrative, bitcoin's (BTC) price dropped to a 10-month low on Thursday, taking many traders completely unawares. Forced liquidations of long positions on derivatives exchange BitMEX have soared past $700 million, adding further downward pressure to the spot price.      While volatility is likely to continue for contracts with short term expiries, Gromniak attributes surging interest in his longer-dated products to investors trying to hedge their long-term exposure.

42431617,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4PDh,1584090000,New York Regulator Tells Crypto Firms to Develop Coronavirus Contingency Plans,"New York’s Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) is requiring the state’s sanctioned cryptocurrency firms to provide detailed coronavirus preparedness plans, signaling the seriousness COVID-19 poses to businesses as well as public health.      “Virtual currency” businesses must produce contingency plans with painstaking and granular detail, according to a letter sent Tuesday. Preparations must include employee protection strategies, increased cyber-risk mitigation, disaster communication plans and procedures to ensure the continued functioning of critical operations “at a minimum.” They must also lay out their point-by-point plans for the eventuality of a potentially snowballing outbreak.      The regulator showed particular concern over the possibility hackers might try exploiting the virus outbreak. NYDFS “underscored” the risk of under-the-radar hacks and implored firms to consider implementing more robust security measures that could detect “fraudulent trading or withdrawal behavior.”      The agency further highlighted the chance remote workers could imperil custodied assets as they move funds from “cold” (offline) storage to “hot” (internet connected) wallets.      Firms are required to submit their plans in the next 30 days, but preferably “as soon as possible,” according to the letter. A NYDFS press officer did not immediately respond to questions over whether the request applies to all BitLicense holders.      The request offers a striking look at New York’s in-the-moment response to a crisis growing more layered by the hour. When NYDFS issued the memo on Tuesday, New York state was already days into a coronavirus-triggered state of emergency. But businesses across the state and its namesake city, where most of New York’s virtual currency firms are based, were still mulling what, if anything, to do in response to the outbreak.      By Thursday, that dynamic had seemed to change, however. Governor Andrew Cuomo declared a moratorium on mass gatherings and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City declared a citywide state of emergency, warning the public that coronavirus could “easily be a six-month crisis” in near back-to-back press conferences.      The drastic shift in public opinion, government outlook and business realities across the week made the plans that only days earlier seem preventative appear far more vital to New York state’s daily life.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/03/13/new-york-regulator-tells-crypto-firms-to-develop-coronavirus-contingency-plans,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d1429b8d96b7850d815d23e5f3de3eb5f2cbdb78-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431626,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4Plh,1584061512,Bitcoin Falls Below $5K as Market Pain Deepens,"UPDATE (March 13, 02:44 UTC): Bitcoin's price briefly sank below $4,000 before rebounding to between $5,300 and $5,500 in a 30-minute period. The rapid price rise followed complaints on Twitter that crypto derivatives trading platform Bitmex had gone offline, though it is unclear whether this is related.      Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader cryptocurrency market continued this week's sharp decline, with the world's largest crypto falling to around $4,800.      The crypto space echoed the broader global trading markets: Equities have been in free-fall mode, prompting another halt to trading as the S&P 500 suffered another 9.5 percent drop on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is also down around 10 percent, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 9.43 percent to around 7,201 basis points.      The Asian markets fared no better as the Australian ASX All Ordinaries dropped 7.23 percent while Tokyo's Nikkei 225 fell 4.4 percent and is set to continue its slide into deeper losses amid the coronavirus pandemic.      Nearly $63 billion has been wiped from the markets as the total market capitalization of all crypto fell from $223 billion to $161 billion, with BTC falling more than 39 percent over the past 24 hours to levels not seen since April 2019.      As for other top crypto assets, ethereum (ETH) is at $109, while XRP (XRP) is trading at 14 cents.      Balances containing 100 or more bitcoin have fallen to their lowest point since Dec. 31, 2019, signaling a flight to cash as other supposed safe-haven assets like gold fell 3.5 percent.      In the near term, investors expect major volatility. However, many express optimism when considering the long-term.      ""Not a market for the faint-hearted. Staggering losses all round,"" CEO of BCB Group Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie said.      ""Ahead of the halving we have a half-price sale and it won’t last long. The market is oversold on correlated global economic jitters and it’s not hard to see a short term correction,"" Landsberg-Sadie added.      However, a small glimmer of hope remains for those high-net-worth individuals, Landsberg-Sadie claims, who continue to put in purchase orders for bitcoin, despite the economic turmoil happening all around.      ""Those four were all purchase orders. Of the high-net-worth individual buyers, two were U.K, one Swiss.""      Others stated it was the long-term perspective that offered more promising returns on their investment as traders await the bloodbath in global markets to conclude.      ""In the long term, we see this period as an opportunity for many investors to get exposure to the asset class at attractive prices,” said Asim Ahmad, founding partner and co-chief investment officer at Eterna Capital.      Ido Sadeh Man, founder and chairman of the board at Saga Foundation, said conditions from a macro perspective look shaky at best.      ""The near-future looks hyper volatile and even chaotic,"" he said. ""This will only continue to weigh on the global economy, and ultimately hurt the pockets of individuals. The only available tool for corporates and households alike is to look at diversification strategies of their assets and currencies, to protect and preserve their value.""      On the technical side, BTC has broken down from a head and shoulders pattern that had been staring down traders since March 8's initial breakdown from $8,900 to just under $8,000.      High levels of spot volume as well as a dip into extreme oversold territory, as seen by the daily RSI, a measure of trend strength and momentum, do not bode well for crypto in the short term although a bounce may be on the cards, once the bloodletting ceases.      ""In the short term we expect the bitcoin price to follow the market sentiment driven by monetary and fiscal policies in response to COVID-19 developments,"" Ahmad added.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/13/bitcoin-falls-below-5k-as-market-pain-deepens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1220436c1b6f383957661d8b82876b7f3f48001a-1440x610.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
