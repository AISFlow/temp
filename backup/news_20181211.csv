""A trusted and regulated platform, however, is just the beginning. The future of money is both digital and mobile, and now Gemini is too with the launch of the Gemini Mobile App,"" he added.  As such, the app features Gemini's institutional-grade security, while remaining easy to use, he claimed.  Among the offerings is Gemini's basket, dubbed the Cryptoverse, which allows customers to simultaneously purchase all of the coins currently offered by the exchange – bitcoin, ether, bitcoin cash, zcash and litecoin – at once.  The coins are weighted by market capitalization, according to the post.  Gemini added bitcoin cash just days ago, after securing approval from the New York Department of Financial Services.

Respondents have 60 days from the RFI's publication in the Federal Register to submit answers, either via email, mail or hand delivery.  ""The CFTC expects the comments and information received will benefit LabCFTC, the CFTC’s FinTech initiative, and help to inform the Commission’s understanding of these emerging technologies,"" a press release explains.

The document lists 25 different questions about ether and the network, divided into the network's purpose, the technology behind it, its governance, markets and oversight and cybersecurity and custody.  The questions themselves touch on various issues and concerns discussed in the space, including ethereum's upcoming move to proof-of-stake, scalability issues, how the network is being used specifically at present and how ether deposits may be audited, among others.  Notably, one question asks: ""How would the introduction of derivative contracts on ether potentially change or modify the incentive structures that underlie a proof-of-stake model?""  A number of questions following this go further into detail about how the ether market might impact a derivatives market built on top of it – or vice versa.

Henrickson's exit comes amid a period of growth at the startup, which in recent months has seen it open a new office in New York City as part of a bid to expand its employee base. At the same time, Coinbase has had some higher-level exits, including long-time executive Adam White (who left to join Bakkt) and Hunter Merghart, its now-former head of trading.

42430015,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM3KJh,1544546122,ConsenSys 'Town Hall' Shows Staff Shaken at Ethereum's Largest Startup,"Internal chat logs from a town hall held Friday by ethereum production studio ConsenSys show that employees are grappling with uncertainty in the face of recently announced layoffs.  A day after confirming that 13 percent of its staff would be cut in what CEO Joseph Lubin called a ""restructuring of priorities,"" company leadership held an all-hands meeting to field questions from members of its roughly 1,200-person team, a meeting documented in a live chat viewed by CoinDesk.  “How many months of runway do we have?” asked one anonymous user.  “I would like to forfeit my position for a colleague (fired) whom I know will add more value to ConsenSys than me,” wrote one named employee in the chat. “Is that possible?”  While CoinDesk was able to observe the company-wide chat in real time, the corresponding, video-streamed answers from ConsenSys leadership were not viewable.  Yet because of what appears to be a reticence on the part of ConsenSys staff members to discuss the ongoing situation within the company, the chat logs present the most comprehensive snapshot to date of the major questions still roiling within one of the blockchain industry’s most notable companies.  ""We are not commenting on internal conversations,"" a ConsenSys spokesman told CoinDesk on Tuesday. ""Quite frankly, these tactics are beneath you and the role CD plays in the ecosystem as a source of veridical information.""  Still, the ConsenSys staff cuts could be a sign of a larger change at the startup, itself comprised of a network of projects and startups all dedicated to building out use cases on the ethereum blockchain. ConsenSys has thus far declined to share which startups, or “spokes,” will be most impacted by the cuts.  “We’re taking a careful look at financial sustainability,” Lubin told CoinDesk in an interview last week.  Some for, some against  On Friday, most chat participants were openly critical of the announced layoffs.  “The wave of lay offs felt like re-enacting order 66,” wrote one anonymous staffer, making a ""Star Wars"" reference. “It looked ruthless and swift. Do the values we claim to profess and hold dear actually hold weight?”  “Who is going to be held accountable for the decisions that got us into this situation?” another wrote. “Who and how?”  Others asked directly about the financial state of the company, and it's unclear if they've received answers.  “Joe [Lubin] earlier today said at the current price [around $85 per ETH] we have many months of runway. Wanted to clarify if that was correct?” one user asked. “Thought runway was previously stated as years.”  Though some chat participants used names that correspond with those of current ConsenSys employees, it’s impossible to verify if other outsiders also participated. Even without corresponding answers, the questions themselves reflect internal sentiment as ConsenSys embarks on a course of belt-tightening and business-minded accountability.  Criticisms aside, some chat participants struck an optimistic tone about the moves and expressed support for the “ConsenSys 2.0” vision first laid out by Lubin one week prior.  “I’m glad ConsenSys went through with this and believe it should have happened much sooner,” wrote an anonymous user. “Far too many people were coasting by on Joe’s benevolence.”  “Thank u for all the opps,” wrote one named staffer. “I am more determined than ever to make C2.0 a success and am proud to be here.”  Writing on the wall  While many questions remain, most agree that ConsenSys’ period of rapid growth could not continue.  ""At some point this needed to happen, but we didn’t expect the change [to come] so fast,"" said one recently laid-off ConsenSys employee, who CoinDesk is granting anonymity. ""Probably the ETH price forced this to happen.""  ConsenSys’ ascent from a famously stickered door in Bushwick to a company with a “mesh” of 50 ventures spanning the globe has been internally funded to date (though Lubin suggested this could change as part of the 2.0 push). And yet while payrolls have skyrocketed as ConsenSys grew, revenues have not kept pace.  As Lubin shifts his company toward more accountability and rigor, the business may also be consolidating its leadership ranks.  Many employees – both in the Friday town hall and privately to CoinDesk – have said they were surprised by the swift downsizing in a culture that had previously bucked centralized authority.  Sources with knowledge of the company have told CoinDesk that more staff cuts are likely.  “Why doesn’t the leadership team that got us here feel the need to reveal who they are?” one anonymous employee asked Friday. “What are they afraid of by being honest with the mesh?”  ConsenSys image via CoinDesk archives",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING,"Zack Seward, Brady Dale",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/12/11/consensys-town-hall-shows-staff-shaken-at-ethereums-largest-startup,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b5d87213beaacfe45a2fafaa5591853e1c1dadfa-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ripple announced Monday that Coinone's payments subsidiary, Coinone Transfer, is now formally releasing the app – which has been under development for months – to the public. It aims to provide unbanked or underbanked individuals the ability to transfer funds from South Korea to Thailand or the Philippines at low cost.  Coinone will be working with Siam Commercial Bank (SCB) in Thailand and a financial institution called Cebuana Lhuillier in the Philippines to get funds to customers. Further, Cross users will be able transfer funds directly to any recipient with a bank account in Thailand through the PromptPay application, which is powered by Mastercard.  The new app will fill a growing need for cross-border remittances, Ripple noted. Thai and Filipino individuals make up two of the largest groups of immigrants in South Korea, which saw $17 billion-worth of remittances into and out of the country in 2017.  Coinone Transfer first announced it was looking at xCurrent in May 2018. At the time, CEO Wonhee Shin explained that using xCurrent allowed the platform to offer customers cheap, real-time payment services.  A number of other banks and financial services firms have begun using the platform in recent months, including SBI Ripple Asia and PNC Bank. Both firms plan to utilize the solution for cross-border payments as well.

42430032,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM3Kjh,1544540425,Panic Mode? What a Wall Street Chart Tells Us About Bitcoin's Price,"Investing in financial markets can be an emotional roller-coaster and the bitcoin market is no exception.  When it comes to investment, human emotions tend to oscillate between two extremes – fear and greed – and the constant balancing act between the two creates a cycle of market emotions.  For years, traders and investors alike have studied the cycle of market emotions with the help of a chart known as the “Wall Street Cheat Sheet.”  As seen above, at the top of the market cycle is “euphoria” – a point of maximum financial risk.  This is the time when investors think nothing can go wrong and a self-feeding cycle is established: more investors enter the market for its stellar returns, leading to a further rise in price and valuations reach dizzying heights before, eventually, reality bites hard.  The cryptocurrency market was gripped by euphoria in the last quarter of 2017. Bitcoin prices rose from $6,000 to $20,000 within seven weeks on speculation that futures launch would open floodgates for large institutions to buy cryptos.  Further, every other altcoin, regardless of its fundamental story, had rallied to record highs by the first week of January. Most pundits came out with bitcoin targets of $50,000 or more at the time.  The bubble, however, was pricked just two weeks into January by a regulatory crackdown in China and South Korea – two of the biggest sources of demand for cryptocurrencies back then.  Where are we now?  Since then, the bitcoin market has arguably gone through ""complacency,"" ""anxiety"" and ""denial.""  In this interpretation, the denial stage, it could be argued, lasted for five months as BTC’s repeated defense of $6,000 offered hope that the broader market and altcoins with strong fundamentals would recover lost ground before the year-end.  Those hopes, however, were shattered as BTC nosedived below $6,000 on Nov. 14, pushing the bitcoin market into the “panic” stage, causing investors to look for an exit with no price floor in sight.  The price of bitcoin has since fallen nearly 50 percent from the $6,000 mark, trading at an average price of $3,327 according to CoinDesk data at press time. More importantly, trading volumes jumped more than 30 percent month-on-month in November. That high-volume sell-off likely indicates many weaker hands have left the market.  The argument for capitulation not having set in yet is that it is usually a single extreme selling event, short in duration but backed by a surge in sell volume and subsequent buy volume.  As recent as Nov. 1, bitcoin suffered just that and it seems panic is still the most likely candidate for bitcoin’s current stage in its market cycle, at least until a break below the psychological price level of $3,000 incites capitulation.  What’s next?  The result of capitulation is a lengthy period of sideways price action and misery felt by investors.  So this leaves us studying the market cycle after recent violent price drops, searching for visual cues of a “bottoming out” of the current bear trend.  And by having examined the different cycles it’s safe to assume bitcoin is close, but not quite there.    Weekly chart      The first stage after capitulation is ‘anger,’ when investors look for some reason for the horrific losses they’ve just experienced.  Finally, reality sets in for investors who then shift from feeling anger to ""depression"" in regards to the financial state they are left in and this is when the bottom hits.  When all hope in the market is lost in the eyes of the public, the market quietly starts to pick up a bid. At this stage, investors have been emotionally battered to the extent they will not believe any rally from here on out can be sustainable.  Although it may be hard to grasp, this point of what seems like utter disaster can be seen as the point of maximum financial opportunity and minimum risk. With all the sellers now out of the market, accumulation at basement prices can begin, which eventually provides the energy for the start of the next market cycle.

42430014,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM3KLh,1544533296,Blockchain-Friendly UK Lawmaker Calls for Crypto Tax Payments,"Eddie Hughes, a member of the U.K. parliament, has proposed allowing taxes and more to be paid with cryptocurrencies.  According to a report from the Daily Express newspaper on Monday, Hughes wants people to have the option to pay council tax to local authorities, as well as household bills to utility firms, with bitcoin or crypto alternatives.  Council tax is levied monthly on households in the U.K. to fund local services, based on the estimated value of a property and the number of people living in it.  Hughes, an MP from the ruling Conservative party, said in the article:  “Only recently I met with the RNLI [Royal National Lifeboat Institution] which is now accepting charitable donations through cryptocurrency – if we can do that, what’s to stop us being able to pay council tax and other bills with bitcoin?.”  The MP added that he would like to see a local authority setting up a scheme to enable crypto payments. ""We need to be seen as a progressive country,"" he said.  The politician has been optimistic about cryptocurrencies and blockchain tech for some time now. Back in June, he highlighted the benefits of blockchain at Prime Minister's Questions, a weekly session in parliament held with MPs, stating that some countries have been able to save up to 2 percent of gross domestic product with the tech.  Later in July, Hughes released a paper on blockchain published by FREER, an initiative from the country’s Institute of Economic Affairs for promoting freedom in the economy and society.  In the paper, dubbed “Unlocking Blockchain: Embracing new technologies to drive efficiency and empower the citizen,” the lawmaker proposed several initiatives, including the establishment of a UK-based international blockchain competition and a public-facing chief blockchain officer.  He further recommended a ""blockchain departmental target,"" a long-term aim for government departments to make a 1-percent efficiency saving by embracing blockchain and other emerging technologies.  In today's report, Hughs also said wider adoption of cryptocurrencies is being held back by lack of knowledge on the technology.  ""It needs to appear like an app that people will use so they can become familiar with it in a safe and secure way,"" he said.  The comments come soon after Ohio last month announced it would allow local businesses to pay a variety of taxes in bitcoin, ranging from tobacco sales tax to employee withholding tax – the first U.S. state to do so. The crypto tax option is expected to be opened up to individuals for levies such as income tax in the future.

The firm announced Monday that it has partnered with a local provider called Callaghan Insurance to provide the policy to cover both hot (online) and cold (offline) wallets listed on the GBX Digital Asset Exchange.  “This represents an important step in attracting users who require strict assurances around the security of their assets,” said GBX CEO Nick Cowan.  The news follows last month’s news that GBX had received a license from the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC) under the jurisdiction’s new regulatory framework for distributed ledger technology (DLT).  GBX is not the only crypto exchange to offer insurance for digital assets. Back in October, Gemini Trust Company, an exchange co-founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, announced it would offer protection for digital assets through a consortium of insurers arranged by global professional services firm Aon.  Centuries-old insurance marketplace Lloyd’s of London is also underwriting cover against the theft of cryptocurrencies as announced in August by Kingdom Trust, a qualified custodian of around 30 cryptocurrencies and tokens at the time.  The crypto insurance market is estimated to be worth around $6 billion, but, as reported, that level of coverage is thought to be insufficient considering the top three exchanges each handle more than $1 billion of trades a day. Notably, crypto exchange unicorn Coinbase already has the lion's share of the available coverage, leaving very little for the rest of the industry.

42430031,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM3Knh,1544526014,Bitcoin Oversold on Weekly Price Chart for First Time in Four Years,"A key long-term bitcoin (BTC) price indicator is reporting oversold conditions for the first time in almost four years.  The widely followed 14-week relative strength index (RSI), which oscillates between zero to 100, is currently seen at 29.80 – a level last seen in January 2015.  An asset or a cryptocurrency is considered to be oversold if the RSI is holding below 30.00. On the other hand, an above-70 reading indicates overbought conditions.  Essentially, the under-30 reading on the 14-week RSI indicates that the recent heavy selling from the highs above $6,200 may have reached a point of exhaustion. As a result, BTC may defend the immediate support at $3,179 (200-week moving average) in the short-run.  Many experts also believe that RSI's drop below 30.00 is followed by a strong corrective bounce. That's not necessarily true as some markets enter into very strong trends, in which case the RSI can stay oversold or overbought for prolonged periods of times.  Notably, BTC’s ongoing bear market is looking quite resilient, as the sell-off is backed by strong volumes. Hence, a strong bounce could remain elusive for some time, despite the oversold readings on the 14-week RSI.  As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,390 on Bitstamp, representing a 2.3 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  Weekly chart  The RSI dropped below the key support of 53.00 on the weekly chart in late January, signaling a bullish-to-bearish trend change. As of now, it's holding in oversold territory below 30.00.  It is worth noting that RSI’s January 2015 drop below 30.00 was short-lived and BTC soon picked up a bid in response to the oversold conditions.  Daily chart  On the daily chart, the immediate outlook remains bearish as long as BTC is trading below the descending trendline.  BTC failed to cut through the diagonal resistance yesterday, adding credence to the bearish setup on the 3-day chart. So too, do the 5- and 10-day MAs which are trending south.  View  BTC could drop to the 200-week MA of $3,179 in the next day or two. That support, however, may hold ground, as the 14-week RSI is signaling oversold conditions for the first time since January 2015.  A break below the 200-week MA would bolster the bearish setup seen in the 3-day chart and open the doors to $2,972 (September 2017 low).  A high-volume move above the falling trendline (on the daily chart) would weaken the bearish pressure. A bullish reversal, however, would be confirmed only above $4,400 (Nov. 29 high).

42430028,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM3Kdh,1544522432,Not Everyone Wants a Bitcoin ETF,"While many traders eagerly await a potential bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), some of the cryptocurrency’s most passionate advocates are lukewarm at best about the prospect of such an instrument.  Twitter is flush with users like crypto entrepreneur Jonathan Hamel posting about how an ETF would bring an “epic” inflow of institutional capital to the ecosystem – that is, “billions” of dollars in new investments.  But if you talk to early adopters and veteran technologists in the bitcoin community, you’ll hear resounding indifference, if not queasiness.  “I don’t think an ETF is going to be some kind of massive magnet,” Pierre Rochard, founder of the Brooklyn-based Bitcoin Advisory LLC, told CoinDesk. “Demand will continue to be driven by sentiment, rather than the availability of specific products.”  Last week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange postponed plans to reevaluate ETF proposals from financial institutions such as VanEck and SolidX to as late as February 27, 2019. This means two more months of nail-biting for those who believe the ETF would be a huge boon to bitcoin or the savior of the overall crypto marketplace.  And yet, in reference to Grayscale’s Bitcoin Investment Trust, which launched in 2015, bitcoin analyst Nik Bhatia told CoinDesk:  “I don’t see the additional ETFs improving bitcoin’s liquidity any more than the GBTC already does.”  Although Bhatia said he would nevertheless welcome a regulator-approved ETF because it might increase public trust in this new asset class, some crypto veterans went as far as to say an ETF could actually be harmful to the broader ecosystem. To them, an ETF contradicts the vision of a peer-to-peer financial network fueled by self-custodied assets.  “It’s kind of a centralizing force and the value proposition of bitcoin is it’s decentralized, global,"" Lightning Labs developer Alex Bosworth told CoinDesk.  Centralizing force  For Bosworth, the biggest risk that a bitcoin ETF presents is that it might incentivize institutions to work collectively to influence the ecosystem.  Referring to the thwarted New York Agreement in 2017 – when leading crypto companies planned to support unpopular bitcoin network updates simultaneously despite public outcry – Bosworth explained:  “We saw companies that are custodians for other people’s coins, talking as if they hold those coins and take actions that decide, on behalf of their users, without even consulting them...We don’t want to have central parties out there negotiating for fundamental rule changes in bitcoin.”  This is the same reason that bitcoin veteran Christopher Allen, the former principal architect at Blockstream, distrusts the institutions that are working to create a regulated bitcoin ETF.  “The real reason they are doing it is they can play financial games to make them a much higher interest rate than what they would otherwise,” Allen told CoinDesk. “I think there are a lot of implications of that. How do we educate people on what fiduciary responsibility and custody really is?”  Bhatia agreed that the industry is transitioning to prioritize a “trusted custody model,” but doesn’t think such institutional products will have a significant impact on cypherpunk traditionalists.  “People that currently store their own bitcoin aren’t going to rush into the ETF because they’re not looking for the same things,” he said.  Don’t hold your breath  Other bitcoin veterans are concerned retail investors are putting more faith in an ETF’s ability to rescue sinking cryptocurrency prices than the prospective product actually deserves.  If approved in the near future, Rochard said, he expects bitcoin ETFs would make up an even smaller percentage of the market than gold ETFs, which he estimated represent less than 2 percent of the global gold supply.  “We’re talking about a very niche part of the market that would be interested in a bitcoin ETF product,” Rochard said. “It would be even less than gold is used in an ETF because the overall settlement cost of bitcoin is lower than those of physically settling gold.”  Others say any boost to the price might be short-lived.  During CoinDesk’s Consensus: Invest conference in November, BlockTower Capital’s chief investment officer Ari Paul warned the audience to recall how the addition of bitcoin futures boosted short-term speculation far more than institutional commitment. The price settled back down within months.  “If an ETF was launched, it’s not that there would suddenly be massive institutional flows. I think on the announcement you’d get a massive rally,” Paul said. “That’s not because you suddenly get $50 million [in] institutional investors’ money, it’s because speculators price it in.”  And it’s important to remember that any euphoria (or anxiety) about a bitcoin ETF is still academic.  On December 5, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce told the audience during fireside chat in Washington D.C. not to “hold your breath,” because a regulator-approved bitcoin ETF could still be years away. She added:  ""I do caution people to not live or die on when a crypto or bitcoin ETF gets approved.""  Operational questions  Even if an ETF were to be approved, bitcoin advocates question how this structure – in which a fund owns underlying assets and divides ownership of them into shares – would address the idiosyncrasies of cryptocurrency.  For example, what if there’s another fork of the network, like the one that create bitcoin cash last year?  “Do they [ETF custodians] give the coins back to people or do they suddenly become an index fund?” Rochard said. “I don’t think there’s a precedent at all [from capital markets], because bitcoin doesn’t have a legal identity and corporations do.”  Allen said ETF issuers would need to clarify how they store and tally their bitcoin, so that products representing this underlying assets wouldn’t be loaned out over and over in a process called rehypothecation. As Caitlin Long, co-founder of the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition, wrote in a Forbes column, rehypothecation is antithetical to the bitcoin ethos because there is a finite bitcoin supply, 21 million at max.  As such, there’s no way to bail out lenders if borrowers were owed more bitcoin than the ETF-issuer actually possessed.  “Substantively, it’s really not that much different than fractional reserve banking,"" Rochard said.  However, Gabor Gurbacs, the director of digital asset strategy for VanEck, told CoinDesk his company’s proposal would involve cold storage, daily disclosures to defuse any concerns about rehypothecation, and a handbook of regulator-approved index fund procedures to follow in the case of a bitcoin fork.  “We intend to stay true to the core tenets of bitcoin,” Gurbacs said, adding that ETF holders would be primarily exposed to the asset defined by Bitcoin Core unless another chain became dominant and equally secure.  “I don’t see any operational issues. I think we’ve figured it out and we’re waiting for the regulators to make a decision on this,"" he went on to explain.  Like many bitcoin advocates, Rochard said that anything which boosts bitcoin’s overall liquidity – even modestly – is a good thing.  On the other hand, he sympathized with the skeptical indifference many technologists feel toward financial institutions.  “It would be really unfortunate if people lose sight of why bitcoin has value,” Rochard said. “But it would be such a small part of the market, so there’d be limited impact on that.”  Businessman on dart board image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BCH | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/12/11/not-everyone-wants-a-bitcoin-etf,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/068ad899395a7ebffb039c0f5c4a1536d2ccf751-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42430012,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM3KBh,1544519445,"UK Crypto Exchanges Pose Low Money Laundering Risk, Says Global Watchdog","Cryptocurrency exchanges in the U.K. present a ""low risk"" for money laundering and terrorist financing activities, according to a report published last week by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global anti-money laundering policymaker.  The report states that while such activities are an “emerging risk,” there is not enough evidence yet to suggest that they are occurring through crypto exchanges.  The regulator, however, has asked the U.K. authorities to work on a plan to extend anti-money laundering and counter financing of terrorism rules in the crypto sector, as well as elsewhere, in order to tackle any potential risks.  FATF asks the U.K. to:  “Continue to develop an understanding of emerging risks (such as virtual currencies) and intelligence gaps, and take appropriate action.”  The U.K. has acknowledged that there are ""inherent vulnerabilities"" associated with the anonymity of digital currencies, the report says.  As a result, the nation is planning to regulate cryptocurrency exchanges under its implementation of the EU’s fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive and monitor exchange services between cryptocurrencies and fiat, as well as wallet providers.  The report arrives in the build-up period before FATF issues guidance for global cryptocurrency regulation, expected by June 2019. The guidance will set out how nations should govern crypto exchanges, companies offering initial coin offerings (ICOs) and digital wallet providers.  That initiative comes in response to leaders from the G20 nations who had called for international coordination on the issue and last week reiterated their pledge to regulate crypto-assets.  “We will regulate crypto-assets for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism in line with FATF standards and we will consider other responses as needed,” they stated.  The U.S. Treasury’s Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence also called on the international community earlier this year for stronger cryptocurrency regulations.

42430016,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM3KHh,1544496383,Fund Seeks $200 Million to Help Startups Survive a Crypto Winter,"A bear market might not seem like the ideal time to be launching a crypto investment vehicle. But that’s not how blockchain pioneer David Johnston sees it – quite the opposite.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Johnston has launched the Yeoman’s Growth Capital (YGC) fund, seeking to raise up to $200 million to invest in projects that have built functioning software but need help getting it into users’ hands.  “We honestly think this is the perfect time to launch a growth capital firm that can take all of these great technologies built in the past few years and help bring them into enterprise and to mass adoption by consumers,” Johnston told CoinDesk.  Johnston’s personal family office (FO), Yeoman’s Capital, has committed an undisclosed amount of capital to the YGC fund, which is now bringing in co-investors, with announcements about limited partners and general partners expected next month. One of the fund’s managing partners is Henry Liu, former growth strategy at Facebook, who joined Yeoman’s Capital in January of this year as chief investment officer.  “It’s a good time to launch this because we are focused on growth and adoption and in these bear market conditions people see the very pressing need for traction – something we have been preaching for the past couple of years,” Liu told CoinDesk.  The crypto winter is looking bleak for sure. Managers who built investment funds that focused on picking tokens or making indexes have seen net asset values plummet as much as 70 to 80 percent. Many of these funds are expected to close.  Also underscoring the state of affairs, blockchain incubation studio Consensys has had to scale back its operations and refocus on projects with a more immediate shot at revenues.  Indeed, the original fundraising target for the YGC fund was more ambitious, but Yeoman’s set the $200 million cap in accordance with the contraction in the crypto markets.  “The cap will be re-evaluated next year once institutional players like endowment funds enter the market, with an average check size of $25 million to $40 million,” Liu told CoinDesk.  YGC’s focus will be rolling the sleeves up and providing projects with long-term help at getting into enterprises, as well as driving sales and marketing, Johnston said.  “I think about what we are doing at YGC as very similar to private equity or traditional growth capital,” said Johnston. “Our focus is on projects that are already live, that already have a mainnet, they have got software, they have got products. What they need help with growth and adoption.”  Early adopter  Stepping back, Johnston, chairman of blockchain data verification startup Factom, is no stranger to the ups and downs of this industry. He co-founded BitAngels, one of the first crypto investment vehicles back in 2013.  Johnston was also a founding board member of the Omni Protocol Foundation, which allowed the creation of tokens on top of the bitcoin blockchain before ethereum became the go-to network for such endeavours.  He began investing his own capital in crypto projects in 2012 and started the family office in 2016, focused on big-picture decentralization and paying all his staff in crypto. Now the FO has some 40 projects in its portfolio including well-known players like tZERO, Polymath and, of course, Factom.  Johnston’s goal is filling the gap in the markets between venture capital and private equity, while working directly with protocol founders and the more mature for-profits being built on top of them. Referring to big names from the private equity world that typically go bargain-hunting in times of distress, he said:  “We haven't seen the TPGs or KKRs of the world move into this space yet. But there is a huge need for this real-world adoption and growth work - and so we are ready to jump into that gap and help grow these companies and protocols for the next few years.”YGC will employ some novel creative techniques to get projects over the line into revenue-generating territory by leveraging the FO’s portfolio companies and in some cases assembling these with other blockchain and non-blockchain partners to custom-build new avenues for growth.  “You can sort of think about this as almost a technology stack where we are going to run these growth plays and it won't just involve one project – it might involve three or four,” said Johnston. “So you can imagine us working with a telco, an exchange, a wallet, and a protocol to provide some new service.”  The newly configured adoption curve might be around bringing remittances into the developing world, he said, or expanding blockchain documents and record-keeping to traditionally expensive areas like mortgages.  Johnston also wants to extrapolate his YGC thesis; he plans to publish a paper soon on decentralizing growth capital which will ask what this type of funding looks like in a blockchain world.  “In a blockchain world you are working with open source communities and a lot of these communities have milestones and bounties to incentivize people around the world to add value to them. We are going to be connecting into that as part of our model,” he said.  Asked if he expects to see a bounce next year when institutional money begins to flow into the digital asset universe, Johnson concluded,  “I couldn't tell what the price is going to be a month from now or a year from now. We really don't do any short-term speculation.”  Left to right: Henry Liu, David Johnston, Gavin Gillas and Mark Thorsen of Yeoman's Growth Capital, image via YGC.
