42379705,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KX0L,1502136325,Bitcoin Cash Eases Mining Difficulty as Blockchain Adjusts,"Bitcoin Cash adjusted its mining difficulty over the weekend, a move that comes just under a week after the alternative version of the bitcoin blockchain was created.  As a result of both blocks (478,647 and 478,648) having a Median Time Past (MTP) that was 12 hours greater than the six blocks prior, each block adjusted difficulty down by 20%. A special rule to the network, Bitcoin Cash implemented the measure as part of its hard fork last week.  As a result, Bitcoin Cash is now 16.7% as difficult as bitcoin to mine.  This has lead more blocks to be found, both because it's easier and because more bitcoin miners are now mining Bitcoin Cash. Since the difficulty adjustment, Bitcoin Cash is averaging about 18-minute blocks, implying a hash rate of around 650 PH/s.  At this rate, we can expect another difficulty adjustment in about 13 days, at which point, the network should have roughly 10-minute blocks, like bitcoin, assuming the hash rate stays constant.  Note that economically, it's still more rational for a miner to mine bitcoin, as Bitcoin Cash needs to be worth about 1/6 of bitcoin's price to be as profitable, which sets the target at $566 at the time of writing.  Bitcoin Cash is currently trading at around $328.

Overstock reported its second-quarter earnings last week, revealing that its Medici blockchain business lost $3.3 million before taxes during that period. At the time, the company explained the loss as necessary as it continues to ramp up development around it t0 crypto-securities trading platform.  In an accompanying earnings callhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/edited-transcript-ostk-earnings-conference-155549361.html, CEO Patrick Byrne was asked about the recent price increases in bitcoin markets and whether Overstock – which has traditionally kept 10 percent of its bitcoin earnings and converted the rest to dollars – had ""changed its strategy"" in light of the developments.  According to Byrne, Overstock's board of directors approved a plan to keep 50 percent instead. Notably, he indicated that the firm may move to hold other ""crypto-securities"", but did not elaborate further on what that might constitute.  He said on the earnings call:  ""I mean we can keep it either in Bitcoin or in some assortment of cryptosecurities. So you'll see a portfolio emerge there. We've had there -- had some good luck with some of our -- we've been storing some coins from counterparties for a couple of years and they've turned out -- they've grown up nicely. Anyway, we have some nice gains in the coin department.""  In response to the question, Byrne said that the company did at one point see a bump-up in overall bitcoin spending.  ""We have seen a material change, in part because of everything in the news it spiked and then it settled back down to about $50,000 per week,"" Byrne explained.

The scope of the thefts – constituting transactions of 0.25 BTC (about $840 at current prices) from an undisclosed number of accounts – is not yet immediately known. The startup – which operates both an exchange service as well as a hosted wallet – indicated in a blog post published earlier today that the incident only a small subset of its customers base.  That said, Unocoin accepted the blame for the thefts and said that it would refund the affected users.  The startup explained:  ""Due to our security protocol, just after a few transactions our server identified the pattern and stopped the subsequent transactions by marking it as pending. We are now working on cancelling the pending transactions to users. Unocoin has taken the responsibility to refund the few transactions that happened to get processed.""  Unocoin suspended logins in light of the incident, though signs on social media indicate that access is being returned to at least some users. In the past couple of hours, several customers have reported on Twitter that their funds had already been given back to them.  The ability to send transactions has also been suspended, which the exchange said would be brought back online pending further security checks.  ""The Send feature will be enabled once our security experts feel that it is perfectly safe to do so.""  The exchange has raised nearly than $2 million in venture capital to date, including a $1.5 million funding round announced last September.

The firm announced today that the banks built the app, aimed at smoothing the process for letters of credit, on top of R3's Corda platform. The banks involved include Bangkok Bank, BBVA, BNP Paribas, HSBC, ING, Intesa Sanpaolo, Mizuho, RBS, Scotiabank, SEB and U.S. Bank. IT consultancy CGI also took part.  At its heart, the app aims to eliminate the paper-based processes for extending credit along the trade financing chain. Testing will continue among other parties, with the goal of expanding the scope of the app – as well as the number of its participants – over the next year.  The app's unveiling comes nearly a year after the startup and a number of those same banks began testing solutions in the area of trade finance. It's a use case that has emerged as a prominent one among the world's financial institutions in the past year and a half.  Earlier this summer, R3 released the public beta of its Corda platform, a move that came weeks after it announced more than $100 million in funding.

The information sharing site revealed that it would take the new payment option in a tweet earlier today, making zcash the third cryptocurrency it will accept for donations following bitcoin and litecoin.  Zcash was notably included as one of the options in a poll the nonprofit held on Twitter at the start of the month. Of the options presented – monero, zcash and ethereum (misspelled as ""etherium"" ) – zcash garnered 11 percent of the 12,204 votes submitted, compared to 21 percent for monero and 45 percent for ethereum. Twenty-three percent opted for ""other.""  Wikileaks, which gained notoriety for its release of materials including footage from the Iraq War and the emails of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, began accepting bitcoin back in 2011.  Since then, the cryptocurrency has proven to be a popular donation mechanism for the group – to date, Wikileaks' bitcoin wallet has received more than 26,000 transactions.  The group – and its founder Julian Assange – have tapped the technology for other purposes as well.  During an Ask Me Anything session on Reddit in January, Assange (who has lived in the London-based embassy for Ecuador since 2012), used data from the bitcoin blockchain as a ""proof of life"" mechanism to effectively quash rumors that he was dead.

42379711,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KX6d,1502115306,Controversial US Sanctions Bill Calls for Cryptocurrency Research,"A foreign sanctions bill signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump included a little-noticed provision on cryptocurrencies.  The U.S. Congress cleared the bill late last month imposing sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea. It was a politically controversial development, given ongoing investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, and the stated opposition of the Trump administration to the legislation.  Trump ultimately signed the bill into law last week, though he sharply criticized the measure in an accompanying signing statement.  Notably for the blockchain industry, however, is that the bill includes a mandate for the development of a national security strategy aimed at ""combating the financing of terrorism and related forms of illicit finance.""  One provision, which focuses on research into ""illicit finance trends,"" mentions cryptocurrencies as an area of study.  The text calls for:  ""[A] discussion of and data regarding trends in illicit finance, including evolving forms of value transfer such as so-called cryptocurrencies, other methods that are computer, telecommunications, or internet-based, cybercrime, or any other threats that the Secretary may choose to identify.""  The initial draft strategy is due to Congress within the next year, according to the bill's text, and is set to include input from US financial regulators, the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security, among others.  In some ways, the new bill echoes another submitted in May as part of a wider Department of Homeland Security legislative package.  That measure, as CoinDesk reported at the time, calls for research into the potential use of cryptocurrencies by terrorists. Like the DHS bill, the new sanctions law doesn't constitute a shift in policy, but rather indicates that Congress is taking steps to explore the issue more closely.

42379704,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KX2r,1502110820,Bitcoin Is Now Worth Nearly 3 Times More Than an Ounce of Gold,"More than five months after bitcoin and gold prices hit parity, bitcoin is now worth nearly three times as much as the more traditional store of value.  The price of bitcoin reached a new high above $3,400 during today's session, a figure that was more than $2,000 above the price of gold. At press time, the precious metal was trading for $1,257 according to a spot exchange rate provided by Bloomberg.  Overall, it's the latest sign that the cryptocurrency asset class may be maturing in the eyes of an increasingly professional set of investors – earlier today, the total value of all publicly traded cryptocurrencies set a new all-time high, rising above $117 billion for the first time.  But while largely symbolic, the finding is notable given that bitcoin enthusiasts have long compared the digital asset to gold, arguing that it is a more effective store of value due to its digital and provably finite nature.  Still, it remains difficult to determine whether the two assets have any relationship in the market, with past attempts to draw a correlation largely coming up empty.  A CoinDesk report from July of last year found that, despite the fact they are both considered safe havens, there is hardly any similarity in market movements.

42379697,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KWu3,1502109002,HP Enterprise Gains on IBM with 'Mission Critical' Move Into Blockchain,"Just weeks after its entrance into the blockchain industry, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) customers are already said to be testing the company's custom-created distributed ledger software.  Built in partnership with R3, the implementation combines the consortium startup's signature Corda technology with HP's own NonStop infrastructure. In short, whereas a paid version of Corda revealed in May is designed for companies conducting high volumes of transactions, HPE's work leverages its own distributed database and messaging systems, upgrading them with Corda's capabilities.  But the proof-of-concept, revealed formally last month, is perhaps best viewed as part of a bigger push within HP that, if successful, could see HPE make up ground it has lost to IBM and other competitors.  Not only is the current proof-of-concept being tested by customers using a ""mission critical"" platform for financial services, but there's more going on behind the scenes to bring this work to its clients and partners.  In a new interview, Markus Ogurek, HPE's financial services and insurance business lead, went so far as to say that once the tests are complete, distributed ledger technology could come to play a role in any enterprise application the company deems too important to fail.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We will be using R3 and Corda through our partnership to address use cases in payments, identity management and possibly other use cases that banks are currently looking at.""  Sparking interest  Key to advancement of this initiative, though, is buy-in from strategic partners, and according to Ogurek, progress is being made.  Specifically, since HPE spun out of HP as a separate entity last year, Ogurek said HPE's own blockchain work has begun attracting the attention of the firm's revamped strategic partners program.  ""We have currently many requests from customers who are eager to discuss ... an end-to-end solution together with R3 Corda, and how they could consume or benefit from it as part of their exploration of the blockchain programs,"" Ogurek said.  Going forward, Ogurek expects to keep up this momentum, aiming to formally announce the company's membership in the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance as soon as September.  HPE has been building up to this moment since at least February of this year, and the company has been working both in person and remotely with members of R3's global engineering team to customize the open-source version of Corda.  And that's in line with R3's own recommendations. The consortium's managing director Ricardo Correia compared the free version of Corda to ""a fully functioning heartbeat,"" one without ""all of the necessary vital organs attached to it.""  To give it the ""fully redundant"" and scalable ""organs"" demanded by enterprises, users must either implement R3’s enterprise services or build it themselves; it's the latter route that HPE is demonstrating with its project.  In this case, the firm hired R3 to help integrate the software with its distributed systems, the result of which was revealed at HPE Discover event in June.  ""You either need Corda Enterprise, or you need to build your own,"" said Correia. ""Which is what HP was trying to demonstrate.""  Making up lost ground  Though Ogurek's statements hint at the ambitions behind the project, it's still early days for HPE's blockchain work. And even if customer tests go well, the firm arguably has a long way to go to make up ground it has lost.  Of the tech giants that have been most disrupted by the age of the internet and cloud computing, IBM has been the quickest to adopt blockchain, becoming a founding member of the Hyperledger blockchain consortium in 2015, and earlier this year, becoming the first member to have its own open-source platform go live with some hundreds of proofs-of-concept estimated to be in development.  By comparison, the Corda integration unveiled in June is Hewlett Packard's first major blockchain initiative to be publicized, and it only recently joined the R3 consortium.  Nevertheless, Ogurek said there are already ""many"" proofs-of concept in the works with HPE's customers, which he declined to name, with a few more being created internally using software developed with the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance.  At stake, though, is more than just bragging rights for the two companies which have have both struggled to to meet revenue goals in recent years.  Core to HPE's struggles are difficulties executing on its go-to-market strategy for hardware products, especially in the business critical systems unit that houses the NonStop hardware, according to a 2016 proxy report.  The report warned:  ""If we cannot successfully execute our go-to-market strategy and continue to develop, manufacture and market innovative products, services and solutions, our business and financial performance may suffer.""

42379700,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KWxp,1502107233,Cryptocurrency Market Tops $116 Billion to Set New All-Time High,"The total value of all publicly traded cryptocurrencies set a new all-time high today.  At press time, data from CoinMarketCap indicates the crypto asset class is now worth just over $116.9 billion, just above of its previous all-time high of $116.2 billion set on June 12.  Overall, the value of the asset class is up nearly 30% over the last week, rising from just under $90 billion on July 31, and up nearly 80% since its recent $60 billion low on July 16.  The price increases come at a time when optimism is beginning to return to markets following a bitcoin hard fork in which a new cryptocurrency was created without disrupting the larger bitcoin network. Over this time, bitcoin has enjoyed broad media coverage, though it remains difficult to determine if new buyers are being attracted to the space.  Data from Google Trends suggests searches for ""bitcoin price"" and ""BTCUSD"" remain down from highs observed in May.  Still, much of the day's gains seem consolidated outside of bitcoin's two largest markets, bitcoin and ether.

42379694,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KWsn,1502100028,WannaCry On the Move? Bitcoin Crime Evolves in a Multi-Blockchain World,"First there was the theft – then the coins stood still.  For the past 10 weeks, three bitcoin address containing more than $140,000-worth of the cryptocurrency have been given more scrutiny than possibly any others on the blockchain. Now held by the hacker or hackers behind the WannaCry ransomware attack, the funds were sent by victims from more than 150 countries in an attempt to unlock their computers from the malicious encryption software.  But last week, something stirred – and increments of $20,000-worth of bitcoin began moving into seven new addresses. Slowly, the three addresses that had held the attention of the world began to empty. The question was, where were the coins headed?  That the subject would gain such attention perhaps isn’t surprising. At the time of the incident in May, WannaCry attracted global headlines, and bitcoin got a share of the blame.  As bitcoin's value grew over the course of the year, and as it attracted a new class of investors, the incident emerged as a black mark – the latest reminder of how the technology can be used to nefarious ends.  ""There's an implication that [blockchains] are well-suited for criminal activity,"" said Andrew Poelstra, a mathematician at Blockstream. ""Because blockchains make it cheaper to move money around the world quickly and privately, there's this meme out there that it's making it easier for criminals to do criminal things.""  As such, for many industry observers, the incident remains a case study with consequences.  Should the criminals be able to cash out the funds, it could be deemed as the latest evidence cryptocurrency can be exploited, despite years of regulations and rule-making.  And if the criminals don’t or can't? That might signal that a maturing set of startups, and the nature of the technology itself, are more able to guard against the type of activity so frowned upon by the powers that be.  A new blockchain in the mix  In context, the fact that the coins are moving at all is something of a shock.  As early as May, it was widely felt the hackers would be unlikely to move the bitcoins for a long time, if at all, as it would be difficult to cash out on major exchanges that monitor stolen funds to meet regulatory standards.  Again, there's also the open nature of bitcoin's blockchain. Those interested in watching the coins move were gifted an easy task, as the WannaCry hackers used only three addresses to collect the ransoms.  But, in an evolving blockchain sector that seems to continue to find new ways to surprise, it could be other blockchains that end up closing the dramatic story.  Of the total funds, $36,000 in bitcoin has now moved through Switzerland-based cryptocurrency startup Shapeshift and into the open-source, privacy-oriented cryptocurrency, monero.  And the switch to the monero blockchain could make things complicated, since it uses several different means to obscure the identity of its users.  Created in 2014, monero is best known for its innovative use of ""ring signatures,"" which are utilized to mix user public keys and account keys, creating a ""ring"" of possible signers so outside observers can’t link a signature to a specific user.  The cryptocurrency protocol also uses ""stealth addresses,"" which allow the recipient to publish a single address, but the coins are sent to a separate, unique addresses.  Unlikely to get away  As a result, many are now wondering if monero changes the game.  Here the answer is less clear. Monero's mechanisms only involve mixing addresses with a small number of other participants, which could generate privacy gaps.  And other mechanisms for evading detection, such as coin mixing, and even other privacy-oriented cryptocurrencies like Zcash, all suffer from this lack of scale, according to Poelstra.  Zcash, for example, allows people to use ""shielded addresses,"" which make the output of a transaction look indistinguishable from every other output.  But according to Poelstra, because of the computational power needed to use shielded addresses, many people aren't using them. So, again the pool is too small for perfect anonymity.  Whether the hackers are eventually captured is a product of how much information they leak, and how much money and time law enforcement is willing to spend using that leaked information to track them, he concluded.  Ultimately, current options for the hackers seem limited.  Given that no blockchain technologies provide complete digital privacy, ultimately, the attackers may be taking big risks in their attempt to finally get away with their loot.  Poelstra concluded:  ""I don’t know whether the WannaCry hackers will get caught or not, but I do know they will not completely hide their tracks; there is information that will leak.""

Yongsan Market, based in Seoul, has told merchants that they aren't allowed to mine cryptocurrencies – bitcoin and ether, specifically – because of electrical costs, rising temperatures and the risk of fire, according to Korea Economic Daily.  According to the report, the Yongsan Market's management has also warned merchants that the subsequent jump in electricity costs will be added to their bills.  The unusual decision is notable given the size of the market (the site boasts thousands of retail storefronts), and is a reflection of the growing popularity of small-scale cryptocurrency mining, of ether especially. As such, it's perhaps unsurprising that some vendors – particularly those that sell the graphics cards needed to mine cryptocurrencies – are using their own products to reap additional income.

42379674,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KUWr,1502092821,PSD2 and Blockchain: Mutual Support,"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis and the author of CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to CoinDesk subscribers.  In this opinion piece, Acheson discusses upcoming regulatory changes in Europe, explaining how trends in payments rule-making may unexpectedly align with those in the blockchain sector.      Europe is about to undergo a massive shift in regulation that will fundamentally change the payments landscape. It's also likely to give an unexpected boost to blockchain development.  Let me explain. It all starts with PSD2, a new payments directive due to come into force in early 2018, aims to change the way banks treat data. While that sounds relatively benign, the consequences will be anything but. Under the new rules, banks will have to share client information with licensed third parties if the client asks it to do so.  This will allow a broad range of financial services to take advantage of an important asset that until now has been treated as proprietary: customer data.  Obviously, this favors fintech companies more than it does banks, who are being ordered to give up an important component of their competitive advantage (exclusive knowledge of a client’s transaction history and asset distribution) in order to help disruptors.  It also sheds light on a deeper goal: to promote innovation in the payments space, whatever the cost.  Shifting gears  The prevailing view in Europe is that legacy payment rails have been holding back growth in commerce and finance. The upgrade began over 17 years ago with the harmonization of central bank systems and currencies, and reached its peak in 2014 with a massive overhaul of cross-border payments within the European Union.  PSD2 is different in that it is not upgrading current systems. It is creating new ones. Rather than figure out how to make processes more efficient, it wants to rethink how payments are made. And rather than tell market participants what the new system should look like, it wants them to figure it out for themselves. In opening up access to data, it aims to give them a powerful tool with which to do so.  Is this starting to sound familiar? It is exactly what blockchain thinkers and doers around the world are working on: how to use new technologies to not only improve current processes but develop entirely new ones, bypassing legacy systems and unleashing a new wave of innovation – and in the process, change how people use money.  Apart from sharing a common long-term goal, PSD2 will also benefit blockchain projects by broadening business opportunities.  For example, financial institutions could end up offering blockchain-based payment services through partnerships. Bank accounts and cryptocurrency holdings could be aggregated on wealth management dashboards. The operations of distributed ledger trading platforms could fundamentally alter if collateral takes on a different form. And the need to protect the freely flowing data could provide fertile opportunities for providers of blockchain-enhanced security.  Loose change  But zooming out even more, a stronger symbiosis emerges. Why are Europe’s financial regulators so keen to kick payment efficiency up to a new level? It’s part of a bigger drive, replicated in other parts of the world, to replace cash.  Contemporary attempts to replace cash with electronic payments have encountered significant friction. With more fluid payment systems, however, the barriers lower. Combine that with a wide range of applications designed to help you manage your financial life with just one device, and you have a new type of service that changes how we see finance.  Given its ability to enable services to share data in a relatively decentralized and selectively transparent manner, blockchain technology could end up being part of the connective tissue of the new system. And given its ability to preserve a semblance of anonymity in electronic payments, it could help a wary public to accept the advantages of going cashless.  Here's where blockchain-based services will most likely start to go mainstream: not in replacing current systems with better processes, but in forming part of new systems in a behind-the-scenes, non-threatening role.
