42378335,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7hyYn,1446588048,"Genesis Trading, Binary Financial to Bid in Final Silk Road Bitcoin Auction","Major bitcoin industry companies including Digital Currency Group (DCG) subsidiary Genesis Trading and bitcoin hedge fund Binary Financial are set to participate in a government auction of just over 44,000 BTC (worth $18.3m at press time) to be held on Thursday.  Announced in October by the US Marshals Service (USMS), the auction, to be held from 12:00 to 18:00 UTC, will see the sale of the last remaining confiscated from convicted Silk Road operator Ross Ulbricht, who was sentenced to life in prison this May.  The initial auction saw investor and Draper Fisher Jurvetson (DFJ) partner Tim Draper purchase nearly 30,000 BTC, and was seen by some as a turning point in bitcoin's history, as many took the sale as a sign it was moving toward broader acceptance.  ""In terms of the auction, it signaled a really important turning point in framing bitcoin as a legal and legitimate tool,"" Sunny Ray, president of India-focused bitcoin exchange Unocoin, recalled in conversation with CoinDesk.  The mood around the upcoming auction, however, is markedly more subdued.  Genesis Trading  CEO Brendan O’Connor said its auction participation was simply a business decision.  “From our perspective, any time we have an opportunity to buy or sell large quantities we take advantage of it. This is just another really good opportunity to do that,” he said.  Involvement unknown  Still, O’Connor suggested he believed many previous auction participants would enter the bidding process for similar reasons, though few confirmed their involvement at press time.  Representatives from Cumberland Mining, Pantera Capital, Falcon Global Capital and investor Tim Draper did not respond to press requests regarding the auction.  Further, the USMS that indicated it would not release figures for the number of auction participants, though it has historically done so on the day of the auctions.  Elsewhere, representatives from regulated bitcoin exchanges such as Coinbase and itBit declined to comment on their potential involvement with the auction.  Gemini  bitcoin exchange founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss told CoinDesk they will not be participating, going so far as to criticize the strategy of doing so:  ""We don’t generally participate in auctions where there is limited information, a high likelihood of a winner’s curse and a low likelihood of achieving an efficient price.”  Gavel image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING | TRADING,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/11/03/genesis-trading-binary-financial-to-bid-in-final-silk-road-bitcoin-auction,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ec24a94896fec16a204c109ab2e29b000ec7c8cf-1500x1002.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42378340,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7hybJ,1446584584,"Bitcoin Poker Site Operator to Pay $25,000 Fine","The former operator of bitcoin poker site Seals with Clubs was sentenced to two years probation and fined $25,000 today after pleading guilty to the unlawful operation of a gaming site earlier this year.  Bryan Micon pled guilty in July after being charged by the Nevada Attorney General's office in the spring. Micon's sentencing hearing took place at 9 am local time in Las Vegas, according to the attorney general's office, which was not immediately available for further comment.  At the time he was charged, Micon faced as many as 10 years in prison, and upwards of $50,000 in fines.  The Nevada charges came after the abrupt closure of Seals with Clubs in February. That same month, state gaming officials raided Micon's home, prompting a flight to Antigua.  Micon later returned to the US to face the charge.  According to a report by the The Associated Press, defense attorney Richard Shonfeld said that Micon would ""complete his probation in Las Vegas and move with his family to Antigua to take a job in the technology office of a newspaper there"".

42378345,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7hyir,1446579946,Payments Giant Worldpay is Quietly Supporting Bitcoin,"Does Worldpay support bitcoin and the blockchain?  The answer, according to senior vice president Chester Ritchie, depends on how you frame the question. Today, the £3.6bn payment processor isn’t doing anything internally with digital currency or the blockchain, he says, but like many payment services companies, it is interfacing with the industry in an effort to best serve merchant clients.  ""I don’t know how public it is,"" Ritchie tells CoinDesk at Money20/20 in Las Vegas. ""We do have partners that are doing something in their solution for bitcoin.""  Ritchie said that bitcoin startups such as BitPay and Coinbase already plug into Worldpay’s payment gateways, through which small and large businesses can accept a variety of payment methods, from credit cards to boleto payments to bitcoin.  As for his personal feelings toward the technology, Ritchie believes it ""remains to be seen"" whether bitcoin and the blockchain, the digital currency’s distributed ledger, can be leveraged to foster changes in Worldpay's business model or the wider payments industry.  For one, Ritchie acknowledges that the technology is becoming more widely thought of as a database or asset management innovation. Also, he believes that the industry has gradually moved toward these use cases as others, like payments, have proved problematic.  ""Is bitcoin the actual cryptocurrency that we think could impact payments?"" he asks. ""I'm still skeptical because of the limited number of bitcoins. People would rather hang on to them rather than spend, so I’m not sure it’s the perfect fit for a currency.""  Industry observation  Still, Ritchie is enthusiastic about the development space, even if it’s clear he views the technology as a bit of a novelty, or at least something that while entertaining, doesn’t exactly have the practical applications that would be needed to entice consumers and businesses today.  That doesn’t mean the company isn’t taking small steps though. Ritchie said Worldpay is headed toward implementing bitcoin as part of its gateway product SecureNet, though he's less clear about how exactly it will fit into the multi-channel commerce product.  Ritchie says Worldpay is also following developments closely through a partnership with the Georgia Institute of Technology, one of the small but growing number of US universities at the forefront of engaging their student bodies in bitcoin and blockchain work.  The university has so far allowed bitcoin to be used to top up student payment cards, and has its own branded bitcoin wallet. With its US headquarters in Atlanta, Ritchie says, Worldpay works closely with Georgia Tech’s incubator, where it sponsors hackathons that specialize in FinTech.  “We have a sandbox where we have this technology and [students] can come up with solutions and we do that all around the incubator. That’s how we keep abreast on this,” he said, adding:  ”Large companies don’t innovate, small companies do.”  Areas of disruption  Though Ritchie is a bit bearish on bitcoin as a digital currency, he seems genuinely enamored by some of the big ideas in the space.  He talks excitedly, for example, about how the blockchain, which can be used to back shared ledgers among financial institutions, could decrease the cost of data centers used for payment processing and the management of such resources.  “I think you’ll see that happen as the first step in the evolution, there could be some application of blockchain technology there,” he said.  Notably, Worldpay is currently in the midst of expanding its data centre presence and migrating to facilities with increased capacity following its sale from Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) in 2010, according to its 2014 annual report.  Ritchie sees a potential opportunity for the blockchain with tokenization as well, suggesting blockchain tokens could be used as a stand-in for cardholder data in online card-not-present (CNP) transactions that currently increase checkout times at e-commerce websites.  Such an idea has also been suggested by security experts at conferences like Keynote 2015, where discussions centered on replacing today's tokens with those logged in shared ledgers.  Level playing field  By easing friction at the point of sale via the blockchain, Ritchie believes that the currency could come to wider acceptance alongside mobile payments, which he argues would then be more convenient for online consumers.  “As retailers start to realize that, they’ll see that they don’t want to take anything but mobile payments,” he continued. “Then [other mobile options] will be on an equal footing with the Coinbase wallet. Whether you’re using PayPal or bitcoin, it’s all the same interaction.”  Ritchie implies that he doesn’t see this transition taking place soon, voicing his perception that most merchants, or even attendees at Money20/20, aren’t familiar with digital currency.  “My perception is if you were to go around and ask ‘Have you bought a bitcoin?' 99% of [Money20/20 attendees] will say no,” he said. “They haven’t figured it out, it seems complicated.”  But, that’s not to see they couldn’t be made aware of the technology.  Over time, Ritchie can see blockchain-based systems “democratizing the financial system” and returning savings to merchants, who he feels pay too much for processing.  Ritchie concludes:  “Payments are costing them 25% on their bottom numbers. So something like bitcoin, you don’t have a lot of these intermediaries, you can knock that down to a full percent.”  Images via Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/11/03/payments-giant-worldpay-is-quietly-supporting-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dfa637cb9a2f2e6fff6d5d47410f1a47d2429345-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Rumours suggesting that Nasdaq – which unveiled its own blockchain-based platform last week – was using the online retailer's blockchain platform to settle trades first surfaced on Reddit earlier today.  However, a representative from Overstock told CoinDesk:  ""That thread is completely mistaken. NASDAQ is doing something similar to, but not using our platform.""  First announced in May, Nasdaq Linq will facilitate the transfers and sale of stock in private companies.  The product is currently being trialled by a few select startups including blockchain technology firm Chain – which worked with Nasdaq to develop the platform – and social tipping service ChangeTip.  Nasdaq further commented on the rumors, stating that it is not using tØ technology in its blockchain products.

42398807,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgcHH,1446571593,Bitcoin Price Breaks $400 Amid 12% Surge,"The price of bitcoin shot past the $400 mark today for the first time since November 2014.  According to CoinDesk's USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), bitcoin opened the day at $359.35 before increasing over 11% to $403.30 at 17:15pm (UTC). It has since decreased to $401.79 at press time.  The digital currency began the year hovering slightly over $300, before dropping below the $200 mark to $177.28 on 14th January.  Today's peak price marks a yearly high for bitcoin, which is represents a 10.7% increase in value from its price on 3rd November last year, when it closed the day's trading at $363.31.  However, bitcoin's price today marks a stark contrast to its value in November 2013, when it peaked at an all-time high of $1165.89.  It is difficult to determine the specific reasons as to why the price of bitcoin is currently trending upwards, but industry observers recently told CoinDesk that it may be related to China's tightening of capital controls and a series of positive news for the industry; including the EU's VAT ruling.

42398805,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgcGI,1446555622,USAA Adds Bitcoin Balance Check Option for Coinbase Users,"UPDATE (19th October 10:50 BST): This piece has been updated with an image from the USAA/Coinbase integration.      American financial services company USAA is rolling out a pilot program that will let some of its customers view their Coinbase bitcoin balances through their USAA online and mobile accounts.  The pilot, as outlined in a new blog post from Coinbase, represents a small but deliberate move by the US military-focused insurer to tap interest in bitcoin among its customer base. In an interview with CoinDesk, USAA framed the pilot – which only allows view-only balance checks with no transaction support at this time – as a means to further experiment with the technology.  Declining to offer specific numbers, the company said that it was choosing customers that have expressed an interest in digital currency in the past. The pilot was previously made available to employees in September, as well as to select testers, followed by the full roll-out this week.  In its blog post, Coinbase shared a gif of how the dashboard tool will work:  [caption id="""" align=""aligncenter"" width=""640""] Coinbase gif[/caption]  USAA was one of several firms to invest in Coinbase's $75 million Series C funding round, telling CoinDesk at the time that its customer base was ""more actively engaged in bitcoin than the average consumer"".  The company has since begun leveraging this interest and its relationship with Coinbase to further experiment with bitcoin and the blockchain.

42398808,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgc9P,1446550204,Gallery: Bitcoin and Blockchain Feature at Money 20/20 2015,"Though somewhat overshadowed by more pressing trends in the payments industry, bitcoin and blockchain were a frequent topic at the annual Money20/20 conference held in Las Vegas last week.  In addition to Money20/20's (Bit)coinWorld conference track that saw top executives from industry firms such as Blockchain, Digital Currency Group and R3CEV take the stage, some of the more interesting announcements at the event centered around the emerging technology.  Blockchain World, a booth sponsored by blockchain technology firm Chain, for example, showcased proofs-of-concept created for name-brand financial institutions including First Data subsidiary Gyft and Nasdaq.  Elsewhere, Visa’s booth featured a full-size connected car, outfitted with mock technology that illustrated how the blockchain could one day allow consumers to secure car leases directly from the vehicle of their choice.  Bitcoin and the blockchain were equally visible on the exhibition room floor, where bitcoin payment processor BitPay, hardware wallet provider Ledger and bitcoin debit card startup Blade were on-hand to educate attendees on their product offerings.  Major financial industry brands were also eager to discuss how the industry could potentially affect their own, with Heartland Payments, and MoneyGram eager to demonstrate their thought leadership on an increasingly hot conversation topic.
