42427317,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1QDh,1485811716,Federal Reserve Staffer Fined for Mining Bitcoins at Work,"A former employee of the Federal Reserve Board of Directors has been fined $5,000 and put on probation after being caught mining bitcoins on a server owned by the US central bank.  The Fed’s Office of the Inspector General said today that Nicholas Berthaume, who previously worked as a communications analyst for the board before being fired in light of the incident, had been placed on 12 months of probation after accepting a plea deal on 27th January. He plead guilty to one count of unlawful conversion of government property, a misdemeanor.  Court documents show that Berthaume, who was indicted last October, had mined bitcoins using a Fed server for more than two years, from March 2012 to June 2014. Bitcoin mining is an energy intensive and competitive process by which new transactions are added to the blockchain.  In a statement, Fed board inspector general Mark Bialek said that his office had not been able to determine the amount of bitcoins earned. He also explained that Berthaume had sought to hide the fact that he was mining as it became apparent to Fed investigators.  Bialek noted:  “Berthaume....modified certain security safeguards so that he could remotely access the server from home. When confronted about these actions, Berthaume initially denied any knowledge of the wrongdoing. Later, however, Berthaume remotely deleted the software that he had installed in an effort to conceal his actions.”  While he did not offer any details, Bialek added that staff for the Fed board had put in place security measures to prevent similar occurrences from taking place.

The round was led by Draper VC, and included support from Greycroft Partners, Blockchain Capital, BnkToTheFuture, Digital Currency Group, Pantera Capital Future\Perfect Ventures and Zephyr Acorn. Of those, Greycroft is a new investor in the startup.  The announcement comes just under two years after BitPesa, which operates in markets like Nigeria, Kenya and Uganda, among others, raised $1.1m in a round led by Pantera Capital. Last year, BitPesa received an investment from The BitFury Group.  Plans for the year ahead include continuing to focus on customer growth and outreach, with a focus on Nigeria, the startup’s largest market.  Founder and CEO Elizabeth Rossiello said in a statement:  “We are well on our way to achieving our goal of becoming the largest licensed payment company in the UK, Europe and Africa that offers real-time settlement at wholesale FX rates to frontier and emerging markets, with best in class compliance and customer service.”  In statements, those backing the firm, including existing investor Tim Draper, highlighted BitPesa’s local approach to growth.  “It takes a locally-based team to work in the evolving landscape of frontier market financial services, and BitPesa's approach to investing in teams, infrastructure, and compliance from Lagos to London gives them a strong advantage,” Draper said.

42427321,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1QLh,1485797881,European Commission Eyes Transaction Limits on Digital Currencies,"The European Commission, the executive branch of the EU, is weighing a limit on cash transactions in a move that may also affect digital currency payments.  According to an impact assessment published by the Commission, the aim of the proposal is to curtail payments in cash, which critics say promotes anonymity when transacting. Any restrictions, the roadmap states, “would be a mean to fight criminal activities entailing large payment transactions in cash by organised criminal networks” – with a similar impact on terrorist financing as well.  On the same foot, such efforts could be used to target digital currencies like bitcoin as well. The European Commission has already moved to extend anti-money laundering and know-your-customer rules to bitcoin exchanges in the economic bloc, bringing those firms under the EU’s Anti-Money Laundering Directive.  According to the impact assessment, restrictions on the amount of cash people can pay with could be applied to digital currencies, which notes:  “In view of the development of cryptocurrencies and the existence of other means of payments ensuring anonymity, an option could be to extend the restrictions to cash payments to all payments ensuring anonymity (cryptocurrencies, payment in kinds, etc.).”  That said, actually implementing the strategy may not be so easy – it might even prove to be counterproductive, the assessment goes on to state.  “On the other hand, restrictions on cash payments could promote the development of alternative payments technologies compatible with the non-anonymity objective pursued,” it reads.  As finance blog Wolf Street notes, the proposal may run into resistance from EU citizens as well, citing a backlash early last year against a bid to cap cash transactions in Germany, the bloc’s largest economy.  While no specific limits are cited in the assessment, it does highlight that different EU countries have adopted different approaches and that any final amount would need to take those strategies into consideration.

In a new release today, Microsoft revealed it is working with blockchain startup Tierion to determine how decentralized identities linked to a blockchain could validate data, claims or agreements. In this case, Microsoft will leverage technology provided by Tierion, which would link data to a blockchain to generate proof of the data's integrity.  As an example, the companies said that this technology might one day help online students receive validation for completed work, with an educational organization augmenting an identity with information that could be recorded on a public blockchain.  ""Anyone with this proof can independently verify the data without relying on a trusted authority,"" the release reads.  The news is the latest that finds Tierion partnering with a major corporate following work with Philips. For Microsoft, it follows its announcement of a supply chain initiative, Project Manifest, last week.

The firm announced today that it would become a contributing member to the effort, launched in late 2015. Sastry Durvasula, a senior vice president and enterprise head of the firm’s data and digital tech division, will join the project’s governing board.  In a statement, AmEx indicated that the work with Hyperledger could lead to new kinds of services for its customer base.  AmEx chief information officer Marc Gordon said:  ""We're excited to join Hyperledger, as we're looking to take full advantage of blockchain to deliver new and innovative products for our customers and partners, while transforming existing business processes and applications.”  The move is the latest for the company in the area of bitcoin and blockchain. American Express Ventures, the firm’s venture arm, invested in bitcoin startup Abra’s $12m Series A round in September 2015 – a move that it said could ultimately have an impact on the kinds of services it offers.  ""As we watch the digital currency industry develop, we have seen that blockchain technology and the distributed ledger can play an important role in shaping the future,” AmEx Ventures managing partner Harshul Sanghi told CoinDesk at the time.  Those comments came less than a year after AmEx CEO Kenneth Chenault said that the technology underlying bitcoin “is going to be important” as the payments space looks to the future.

42427323,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1QNh,1485788424,Swiss Blockchain Consortium Develops Ethereum Trading Tool,"Businesses in Switzerland working on an ethereum-based over-the-counter (OTC) trading platform say they have completed work on a new privacy solution.  Launched in September  , the consortium includes a number of Swiss companies amongst its ranks, including telecom operator Swisscom, exchange operator SIX and Zürcher Kantonalbank, the country’s fourth-largest bank. The group is receiving support from Switzerland’s Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI), a research organization supported by the federal government.  Now, the companies have jointly developed what they call an ""encryption module"" that prohibits certain types of information from being seen by other parties. At the same time, the module’s design is said to allow for law enforcement agencies to gain access to that information during investigations.  Project manager Mathias Bucher said in a statement:  ""Our privacy solution paves the way for the usage of the ethereum blockchain in financial markets.”  The tool is now being put before the relevant regulatory bodies – a process that will play out over “the coming weeks”, according to Bucher. Among those involved on the regulation side of the project is the Swiss National Bank, the country’s central bank, which is reportedly overseeing development of the OTC platform.  The development is the latest news out of Switzerland’s growing blockchain scene.  The past months have seen bitcoin-buying services being offered by Swiss rail operator SBB and new blockchain work within the country’s finance services sector, for example.  Additionally, bitcoin wallet startup Xapo announced last week that it had received preliminary approval from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), Switzerland’s key financial regulator, to operate in the country.

42379184,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nQkx,1485783052,IoT Meets NFC In Zerado's New Blockchain Prototype,"While banks have been busy performing experiments with blockchain tech, London product consultancy firm Zerado has already built a prototype for an access control system using blockchain, NFC and Internet of Things (IoT).  Built to handle both identity and payments, the basic idea is to use blockchain technology to store information about who is authorized to use a physical device (such as a door lock) and to authoritatively determine and authenticate the identity of the person trying to use that device.  Once authenticated, the person will be able to use the services controlled by the physical device, either by prepaying or by paying on the spot, based on availability.  In a way, Zerado’s prototype is similar to that proposed by Slock.it before the infamous DAO incident, though it uses a private blockchain implementation, rather than the public ethereum blockchain.  Tomasz Mloduchowski, the CTO of Zerado, believes that using this design allows the company to leapfrog over incremental technology improvements and use a system that will likely become ubiquitous in the future.  In addition, he believes that the use of a blockchain makes the development of the system much easier to deploy to real-world systems, while also giving full control to the users to decide what level of data sharing is required for the application.  Also notable is that instead of using private key signature as an authentication mechanism, Zerado leverages existing contactless payments systems found in most debit cards in Europe for both payment and identity-authentication.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Access control has a set of unique requirements that neatly match the capabilities of blockchain. From the needs of security, through the use of EMV cards, to the auditability.""  Checking in  One immediate use case is for the idea would be in the hotel check-in process, where a guest could pay for a room over the Web, and use a debit card at the hotel for access.  The information from the debit card is read by an IoT device which controls the door lock and is connected to all other such devices in the hotel. Once authenticated, its state is propagated to all the other locks, which would now know not to grant access a second access to this identity.  The company sees a similar use in coworking spaces, which need a constant monitoring of who is allowed to access which rooms and for what durations.  Any EMV-enabled credit or debit card that is able to electronically share data (such as the name on the card) can be used for authentication. Different issuing banks provide different types of card data to the card-reading devices, and the authentication is then performed using multiple pieces of data pulled from the card.  Zerado’s working prototype uses a private blockchain to store information about identity and authorization, along with the payment state.  It is capable of using a debit card both as an identity for user authentication and as a payment mechanism.  Key values  Of the notable features of the prototype, however, is that it uses the UK’s contactless payment cards, which are ubiquitously issued by banks and financial institutions.  Behind the scenes, these cards use near-field communications (NFC) technology to communicate between the card and the device. (Point-of-sale terminals in Europe, for example, already pull data from a debit card for payment reasons.)  However, in addition to the payment information, they also contain information about identity issued by the bank, such as the name of the person.  Using this type of information, the IoT-enabled locks are able to perform authentication on the user trying to access a resource. This also enhances security, because the same mechanism can be used instead of separate hotel key cards that are seldom without vulnerabilities as the technology stands currently.  Zerado has also built offline resilience into the system as a whole, which could realistically operate even in the event of a loss of connectivity.  A valid offline transaction is created, which is then manually relayed to all the nodes in the system. In the example of a hotel room, when the state of the blockchain changes, a ""master key"" (which contains the latest transaction information) can be used by the staff to manually update the blockchain stored by the individual nodes.  This is possible because the nodes each contain a full copy of the blockchain.  Broader use  But while the current prototype uses a private blockchain for access control and payments, Zerado believes it has applications in many different sectors. Although, they will likely all require different design decisions and trade-offs.  To this end, the company has already created application-specific products that use a blockchain in the backend. For example, a working capital finance proof-of-concept was created that stores transaction history across multiple parties in a supply chain.  There is also a blockchain product called Disberse that the firm hopes to utilize in bringing more transparency in the humanitarian aid sector.  Zerado is building prototypes of various use-cases, which it says bring real solutions to industries. That it happens to use a blockchain in the backend is immaterial to the users of the system, but provides them with many benefits: from security and auditability, to privacy and ease of deployment.  Imogen Bunyard, COO of Zerado, told CoinDesk:  ""We see a great deal of value for blockchain in every sector – whether to implement now, or to future-proof against increased security risk and more sophisticated standards.""

42379180,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nQhB,1485774008,Change in China (And What It Means For Bitcoin),"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis, corporate finance and fund management, and is a member of CoinDesk's product team.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.  The financial world saw history made last week when, for the first time ever, a Chinese head of state took the podium at the World Economic Forum's famed Davos conference in Switzerland.  Issued on 17th January, Xi Jinping's speech has since been interpreted as a response to rising protectionism – and an attempt to consolidate China’s position on the world stage.  But, it's worth examining in another light.  It is also likely to be indicative of the path Chinese authorities will take regarding the country's bitcoin exchanges.  A recap  While we've been focusing on the central bank's scrutiny (and its potential impact on bitcoin's network and price), this view masks the bigger picture.  First, a bit of background. Over the past weeks, we’ve seen clear evidence of China's weight in global bitcoin markets.  News of meetings between the People's Bank of China (PBoC) and leading exchanges sent prices tumbling.  The subsequent suspension of margin lending and the introduction of trading fees had dramatic effects on volumes, and many feared that the resulting dent in Chinese demand would dampen price growth.  Some interpreted the moves as an impending crackdown on bitcoin.  China needs to stem capital outflows, the reasoning went, and since bitcoin is an attractive vehicle for that, it needs to be stopped.  Feet wet  On the surface, this might make sense. Traditionally, the US has been the world’s champion of free trade while China has dragged its feet.  But now, the tables seem to be turning, China appears eager to position itself as a 'modern' economy with a flourishing FinTech ecosystem.  Part of that is seen in its interest in blockchain technology.  Earlier this week, local news sources reported that the PBoC had tested a blockchain-based digital currency and is establishing a related research institute. Furthermore, banks, startups, academia and consortia are working with international institutions to foster a bustling blockchain environment.  While interest in permissioned ledgers is not the same as support for digitized assets like bitcoin, a desire to participate in foundational change bodes well for the acceptance of alternatives.  And an understanding of how the technology works should prevent impractical measures. (The PBoC has not, to our knowledge, indicated an interest in banning bitcoin, nor is it likely to).  Most pronouncements have expressed a cautious interest, and trading restrictions are less an indictment than they are part of the central bank’s job.  Ebb and flow  Capital outflows, on the other hand, are a concern, but local experts downplay the threat to monetary policy. While most of the world’s bitcoin mining and trading takes place in China, the cryptocurrency’s market capitalization is minute compared to the overall size of the Chinese economy.  More broadly, the recent interest in bitcoin exchanges could well be part of a larger attempt to deflate asset bubbles.  This week, the PBoC asked banks to curb lending, ahead of what is traditionally the strongest quarter for growth in loans. The request stressed the importance of reducing mortgage allocations, with the hope of curtailing runaway real estate prices.  The central bank also raised interest rates for the first time in years, which some analysts interpreted as part of its objective to curtail speculation.  While the bitcoin-related moves do seem to inch towards regulation, few believe that would be bad for the sector. Most appear to focus on the legitimacy it would bestow and the confidence it would give the ecosystem.  Looking ahead, political and economic troubles could complicate things.  The possibility of a trade war or even a military conflict in the South China Sea could send the exchange rate lower, drive the BTC price higher and put increasing pressure on China's government to appear strong, especially in the run-up to its 19th party conference later this year.  Tables turned  Yet, as China heads into its week-long holiday for the Lunar New Year, the approach seems to be one of dialogue and further investigation.  In his Davos speech, President Xi quoted a Chinese proverb:  ""Honey melons grow on bitter vines, sweet dates grow on thistles and thorns.""  This not only is a fitting metaphor for China’s internal conflict between wanting to participate in (or even lead) global progress and at the same time keep things calm at home, it also seems to sum up bitcoin’s struggles to become an accepted medium of exchange in a world of shifting priorities.  And it should reassure us that, in China, bitcoin is not a target.

42379197,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nR03,1485751738,A Plan to Scale the World's First 'Sports Blockchain' is Accelerating,"A Taiwanese insurance company is building a network of blockchain protocols to help its customers reduce the price they pay for coverage.  The one-stop shop, built by Taipei-based Fubon Life Insurance, is designed to incentivize healthy behavior and reward customers with lower premiums. But while the project is still in its early days, it had its first live test last month.  The first blockchain implementation is Bravelog, a private version of the ethereum blockchain, custom-built to record race and biometric data. It was tested at the Garmin Lava Dapeng Bay Triathlon in Taiwan on 7th January.  Based on the success of the event, Fubon has shared exclusively with CoinDesk its plans to scale that blockchain project beyond its current scope.  The head of Fubon’s Taipei FinTech office, Chris Tsai, told CoinDesk:  ""Bravelog, in the future, wants to become a complete sports ecosystem with ticketing, registration and payments services.""  The inaugural race took place with Fubon's Bravelog blockchain serving as a common protocol on which participants ranging from athletes, equipment providers and event organizers could interact.  In total, 349 people participated in the event, including the blockchain's developer, Alex Liu, CEO of the Amis blockchain consortium.  Liu and the other racers shared their personal data to a blockchain, ranging from race metrics to the individual's pulse, based on biometric measurements provided via Garmin devices.  Behind the design  Billed by Fubon as the ""first sports blockchain"", the early version of Bravelog was developed by Amis using Microsoft's Azure Platform.  The user interface was built by the Industrial Technology Research Institute of Taiwan (ITRI), a government research group, with nodes that were run by Fubon, Amis, ITRI and the triathlon organizers.  However, Liu envisions future applications where nodes would be run by anyone who needs to access the personal health data, including insurance providers, health service professionals and users themselves.  To give an idea of the scale of the project, Fubon Life generated $1.24bn in profit in 2016, making it the most profitable subsidiary of parent company Fubon Financial. Fubon Life accounted for 64.5% of the parent company's total profits in the same year.  However, Tsai believes he can increase that number by incentivizing healthy behavior. The idea is that customers could voluntarily grant Fubon and others access to their data in exchange for lower premiums.  That in turn would serve the double purpose of making the customer less susceptible to expensive illness and attracting new customers.  ""We want to promote a healthy lifestyle,"" Tsai told CoinDesk.  ""And with our study into blockchain we realized we can really accelerate the process – or make it possible.""  The Misfit fit  But this service is not new. Already companies like California-based Misfit provide similar incentives, and they're doing so rather successfully.  After signing a deal in 2014 to provide fitness and sleep data to Oscar Insurance Corporation, venture-backed Misfit was acquired by Fossil watches for $260m.  Oscar customers can earn $1 a day, up to a maximum of $240 a year, for wearing the device which provides data – including steps taken, calories burned and quality of sleep – to the insurance provider.  In addition to Garmin, which sponsored the triathlon at which Bravelog launched, competitors also include Fitbit, Withings and more.  The crucial difference between these services and Bravelog, though, is who owns the data, according to Liu.  As part of the event, participants had to create an identity, that if they chose, could go with them to another event with totally different hardware because they own the data.  Liu said:  ""What we would like to see is a common protocol that [can be accessed by] multiple Misfits, or Misfit and its competitors, multiple insurance companies, and so on and so forth. And the central owner of that data, presumably should come back to the individual.""  The sports ecosystem  Bravelog was developed in Fubon's FinTech office in Taipei, which Tsai established last year to explore blockchain and other financial technology applications.  The blockchain project falls between two of the office's core objectives, big data analysis and healthcare.  Tsai believes that, in the future, blockchain also has the potential to help him meet other objectives in digital finance and information security.  Already being developed is a financial services implementation of the blockchain protocol developed by Amis to help Fubon Life’s parent company streamline interbank transfers and loan payments.  This service, in turn, could eventually run alongside the health side of the project, facilitating the sale of tickets to sporting events and other transaction across Fubon's subsidiaries.  To facilitate the interbank work necessary for such an endeavor, Fubon last year became a founding member of the Amis Taiwan blockchain consortium, along with Cathay Financial Holdings, CTBC Bank and others.  While the Bravelog blockchain and the interbank blockchain payments tools are currently separate, Liu tells CoinDesk he’d like to one day see them run on a single blockchain with a universal self-sovereign identity.  Liu concluded:  ""When it comes to health data, just as in the financial services world, people are espousing that ideal. So that irrespective of who my securities broker is, who my insurance company is, who my bank is, I’m only selectively exposing my personal data to each of them.""
