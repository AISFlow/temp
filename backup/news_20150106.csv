42426240,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJGM5h,1420586705,Wedbush: Bitstamp Issues Shouldn't Dampen Confidence in Bitcoin,"Wedbush Securities issued a new report today in which it examines how bitcoin evolved in 2014 and why, despite challenges, it believes the ecosystem will bolster its still nascent infrastructure in 2015.  The 13-page report is the latest from the US financial services and investment firm, which has been among the more outspoken players in the finance industry on the subject of digital currencies.  Though wide-ranging in its analysis of the bitcoin ecosystem, perhaps the most notable comment from Wedbush addressed the ongoing outage at leading US dollar bitcoin exchange Bitstamp, which it argued shouldn't color perception of the industry as a whole.  Authors Gil Luria and Aaron Turner wrote:  “Weakness in unregulated foreign-domiciled third-party providers such as Bitstamp should be viewed as such, not as a weakness in bitcoin or the underlying technology.”  Luria and Turner went on to voice their opinion that the incident underscores the need for bitcoin trading to migrate to “regulated, robust, liquid and secure venues” in 2015.  The comments notably echo sentiments Wedbush expressed at the time it completed its first investment in the bitcoin ecosystem via bitcoin marketplace Buttercoin.  In its public comments, Wedbush lauded Buttercoin as a necessary step in the maturation of the bitcoin market, noting its “reliable trade execution” and established US banking relationship.  However, the lion’s share of the report focused on bitcoin’s accomplishments in 2014, as well as what it sees as a path the technology will travel on in the year ahead.  Bitcoin already ‘quietly mainstream’  In contrast to some observers who it acknowledges try to paint the ecosystem as a niche community, Wedbush argues in its report that bitcoin already went ""quietly mainstream"" in 2014.  The report stressed the integration of the technology at leading payments companies as evidence of bitcoin’s overall success.  “We believe the integration (not acceptance) of bitcoin by a range of companies from old guard NCR and First Data to Silicon Valley leaders PayPal and Intuit serves as the ultimate validation of the impact of the technology, not to mention the broad positive commentary from other industry participants,” the report reads.  In this light, Wedbush argues that bitcoin has the potential to disrupt legacy financial institutions “over the next few years”.  Price conversation evolves  Another topic the paper discusses is the relationship of the bitcoin payment network to the price of its native currency, and the tendency of observers to correlate the performance of the price with that of the ecosystem.  “We find investors continue to (mistakenly) view the price of the bitcoin currency as a forward indicator for the success and impact of bitcoin blockchain technology,” the authors write.  Wedbush voiced its belief that the technology’s innovation is likely to continue regardless of its price, using analogies to more traditional markets to underscore the point.  ""2014 has shown that bitcoin prices are only related to the success of underlying technology as gasoline prices are related to car sales,"" the report notes.  Instead, Wedbush suggested a more suitable metric for the overall performance of bitcoin could be the adoption of the technology.  For example, it compared the number of merchants enrolled by bitcoin processors BitPay and Coinbase, claiming that they have added more consumers than Apple Pay, the tech giant’s mobile payments app introduced in September.  Use cases to take hold  While much of the ecosystem’s focus will be on developing and improving its infrastructure, Wedbush predicts that bitcoin will begin to disrupt certain areas of commerce in 2015.  More specifically, the report named microtransactions and remittances as areas where it expects bitcoin to gain traction.  Elsewhere, the report concluded, bitcoin’s technology can be expected to continue its slow but steady development:  “We expect 2015 to mostly continue the hard work of building venues, settling regulation, and integrating into the existing financial services environment.”  Image  via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/06/wedbush-bitstamp-issues-shouldnt-dampen-confidence-in-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a4dc0cb908d143d6031f31e272ca3f9c0843cc28-1000x640.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The bitcoin payment processor launched Copay on the Windows app store Tuesday at the CES consumer electronics and technology tradeshow in Las Vegas.  The news follows the December announcement that Microsoft had begun accepting bitcoin through BitPay for select apps, games and video purchases.  Still in beta mode, Copay was initially developed for BitPay’s internal use, with its multisig functionality proving to be advantageous for corporate fund management and transactions requiring multiple authorizations, the company said.  Copay was released  as a security solution last year as demand for multisig technology increased.

42426243,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJGM9h,1420566328,Gliph Marketplace Launches as 'Craigslist for Bitcoin',"While the bitcoin community has grown over the past year to include hundreds of new global merchants, there remains a strong market for person-to-person transactions as evidenced by existing marketplaces like LocalBitcoins and Brawker.  Still, interactions on such platforms remain difficult according to Gliph. The self-described secure messaging and bitcoin payments startup has released a marketplace feature in its app with the aim of enhancing person-to-person commerce with bitcoin on smartphones.  Gliph  CEO Rob Banagale explained that by launching Gliph Marketplace, his company is trying to insert bitcoin into the person-to-person buying and selling process, aiming to help people save money by using bitcoin instead of other payment methods.  He told CoinDesk that the goal of Gliph Marketplace is to place bitcoin in the middle of day-to-day transactions, saying:  ""I feel like the challenge with bitcoin is that it is so new and it is so hard to get into your daily life. It’s very hard to make it practical for a lot of people.""  Enter Gliph Marketplace  Gliph has long been known as a messaging platform with a bitcoin layer on top. By allowing users to connect their Gliph account with a Coinbase or Blockchain wallet, the app enables users to attach bitcoin to messages on its platform.  Now, with Marketplace, Gliph is adding peer-to-peer commerce functionality where users can buy and sell items. Additionally, buyers can message sellers and conduct bitcoin transactions directly in the app.  Banagale argues that communication through sites like Craigslist often happens through third-party email services and requires an additional third-party platform like PayPal to send money in exchange for goods or services.  Gliph Marketplace, by contrast, reduces each step to one application available for iOS, Android and desktop via the web.  “With Gliph Marketplace, we’ve tried to solve a lot of the problems around traditional peer-to-peer transactions that you find on Craigslist. And try to do better - way better,"" Banagale said.  Getting the transactions flowing  Banagale said Gliph has focused on ""the hardest, crappiest parts of doing a Craigslist deal"" to build a better experience with Marketplace.  As Craigslist users might know, the site leaves a lot to be desired in terms of usability. The site has only a few features and does not always seem an easy place to actually conduct online buying.  With Gliph Marketplace, the two payment options are bitcoin and cash. There's also a value-add opportunity for bitcoin users that want to save money. Sellers have the option to offer a discount of up to 40% off the listed price for buyers that want to pay in bitcoin.  Further, users have the option to make in-person cash transactions that would be confirmed on the app.  Banagale hopes this feature of Marketplace will help users understand the cost effectiveness bitcoin provides as an electronic payment mechanism.  ""In order to solve [adoption] problems, you can’t just demonstrate how bitcoin works,"" he said.  Gaining traction  Banagale conceded Gliph Marketplace does not have the type of mass exposure Craigslist has built. But even so, he believes the idea of supporting bitcoin will attract both buyers and sellers to the app.  ""We hope people use Gliph Marketplace because they want to see a product that supports bitcoin, to make bitcoin a real thing,"" he said.  Gliph hopes to see return use of its app not just for commerce but also communication – the original purpose of the app itself is secure messaging using AES-256, and SSL. As such, people remain contacts on Gliph after a marketplace transaction.  “We allow people to become contacts with one another. They are now contacts, they are going to be able to continue to have a conversation,” said Banagale.  Though it may have a tall task in trying to counter Craigslist in the long run, Gliph has support as a veteran of bitcoin startup accelerator Boost VC in 2013. The company also has backing by investors such as Pantera Capital and Tim Draper.  Users can download the latest version of Gliph with Marketplace functionality from the iOS App Store and the Google Play Store. A web-based desktop version can be also used from the company's official website.

42426235,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJGLvh,1420552888,US Treasury May Consider Bitcoin Industry Concerns Over Banking Access,"The US Treasury Department plans to spell out the government perspective on financial access for money services businesses (MSBs), as well as hear concerns from the MSB community, at a roundtable discussion next week.  In response to the announcement of the meeting, the Chamber of Digital Commerce (CDC) has created the Financial Access Task Force and applied to make a presentation highlighting the issues that digital currency businesses face when trying to establish banking relationships.  The CDC, a digital currency advocacy organisation, is preparing industry data and comment that is currently being collected through a survey on the problems digital currency or asset-related businesses have faced opening and maintaining bank accounts – whether or not they are MSBs.  Highlighting banking issues  Forging banking relationships is crucial for businesses dealing with bitcoin and other digital currencies and assets, as well as for the growth of that ecosystem. However, many companies large and small have had difficulty doing so, or have had their bank accounts terminated for their association with digital currency.  The CDC seeks to bring greater attention to this issue at the Treasury meeting, at which industry representatives and members of the government, regulatory community, banking and credit union sectors, and MSB sector have been invited to participate.  “The purpose is to collect some real solid data on what is going on with digital currency companies and to be able to show what’s actually happening in the marketplace,” said Carol Van Cleef, chair of the CDC's Financial Access Task Force.  Van Cleef is also the co-chair of the Global Payments practice group and a member of the Financial Services and Banking practice at law firm Manatt, Phelps & Phillips.  She said:  “We’re hoping to encourage a more wholesome dialogue about digital currencies in the banking system. We want to work to get banking organisations more comfortable with the concept of digital currencies so that they’re not regarded as being bad actors.”  Denying financial access  The CDC is taking this action in part a result of FinCEN’s determination that certain types of digital currency companies are considered MSBs.  Van Cleef said:  “We are really at another inflection point in the MSB industry and unfortunately digital currency companies are in the wrong place and at the wrong time, and are getting sucked into what’s going on.”  The passage of the Patriot Act brought increasing pressure on banks in the early 2000s to look more closely at their customers, determine if they were money transmitters or MSBs and make decisions about whether they wanted to keep those customers.  As a result, the banking industry effectively became a de facto regulator for MSBs, loading them with more compliance requirements in just a couple of years than money transmission regulators did over decades.  It also led to many MSBs’ bank accounts being closed for any number of reasons – often that they were unlicensed or that they were unregistered – but in a lot of cases because the institutions didn't have the resources to carry out the due diligence being demanded from them in order to bank new customers.  Now, many banks will simply refuse service to MSBs because companies classified as such aren’t included in their risk profile, Van Cleef said, adding that it isn’t uncommon for banks to treat a business as an MSB without first understanding if it falls under the status of an MSB, or how it differs from a business that does.  “Money transmitters are where the regulated piece of the digital currency business seems to be lumped into,"" she explained. “They have been a very factionalized industry and they haven’t been able to put forward a strong voice or position on this issue.”  Assistance with compliance  The CDC aims to bring digital currency companies up to speed regarding their obligations for compliance, federal money laundering and criminal statutes, and teach them what anti-money laundering (AML) compliance is and how to manage it correctly.  The initiative, Van Cleef said, is underscored by the recent sentencing of Charlie Shrem for aiding and abetting the operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business.  “Silk Road allowed us to more carefully distinguish between illegal currency and illegal use of something that's very legitimate,” she said. “But that distinction often gets lost on very busy compliance officers.”  Additionally, the reports of continuing growth since the demise of Silk Road of listings for illicit goods and services that can be paid for in bitcoin, she added, doesn’t ease the nerves of bankers or regulators.  But compliance, she continued, is the name of the game. Teaching people what compliance is all about, how to think about it and how to act within its boundaries, will be key to getting businesses, banks and regulators on the same page.  “There’s probably not too many banking institutions that haven’t been tested at some point or another by criminals, and they’ve learned how to cope,” she said. “And that's where AML compliance systems come into play.”  Treasury building image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Tanaya Macheel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/06/us-treasury-may-consider-bitcoin-industry-concerns-over-banking-access,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4aead7eb68d431b9b331a5b50e4d9736e3805e9a-1000x744.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426245,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJGMFh,1420543415,Bitcoin Payments Prove a Sales Success for Green Man Gaming,"One of the world's biggest digital game resellers, Green Man Gaming, says bitcoin has been a popular choice since it was introduced as a payment option early in December.  The UK-based company spoke to CoinDesk about the bitcoin rollout and why it decided to take the plunge into accepting digital currency via a partnership with payments solutions provider Stripe.  Paul Sulyok, the firm's CEO, said that the holiday season, which is usually the busiest time of year for the gaming industry, immediately rewarded Green Man's decision to accept bitcoin:  “Since launching bitcoin as an option a month ago, we immediately saw transactions being made. During the first weekend of our holiday sale, we saw our highest day of money paid with bitcoin reach 5%, with the most popular Green Man Gaming purchase from bitcoin customers being the Valve Complete Pack.”  The tech-savvy nature of the company's clientele has meant that bitcoin was a natural step for Green Man, explained Sulyok.  “We were inundated with requests to accept bitcoin,"" he said. ""Bitcoin is part of our customer’s lives online. For many it has already become part of their language and they want choice when paying for their purchases.”  Green Man Gaming  currently sells games in 186 territories around the world, offering over 5,000 titles from 350 publishers. The company also operates Playfire, a global social gaming network that it acquired in 2012. The Playfire platform is also used to reward gamers through a number of loyalty programmes.  Sulyok explained that one of the main drivers of the decision to accept bitcoin was a buyer’s survey conducted in May 2014, which revealed digital currency as an option that was very much on customers' wish lists.  He said:  “Speaking directly to millions of gamers each day on a personal level, we can understand and genuinely share their passions and preferences.”  According to the company, more than 6,000 people took part in the survey, with 30% saying they were aware of digital currencies and how to use them. A total of 89% said it was important for retailers to offer a wide selection of payment methods.  Future role in digital content  Sulyok described the addition of a bitcoin option as a means of building up a strong community by meeting its different needs – something that is paramount to any retailer.  “Businesses, especially those operating solely online with global audiences, should never ever forget who they are doing all of this for,” said Sulyok. “I wouldn’t be surprised to see other retailers considering bitcoin as a payment option in the future.”  When asked whether Green Man Gaming could start using bitcoin or blockchain technology as part of its Playfire loyalty schemes, he said: “It’s certainly something we might consider in the future. Playfire already offers a range of ways to earn special rewards and credit that reduces the cost of gaming.”  Sulyok said he had always believed that digital downloads would become the dominant and preferred way for people to get their games.  He explained:  “It was the whole basis for why I founded the company, and I think digital currencies like bitcoin have an important role to play in the future of e-commerce, no matter what the industry.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/06/bitcoin-payments-prove-a-sales-success-for-green-man-gaming,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/65ab9d3f1bad1bd98c04f53f65d682ed35a79b10-962x646.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426248,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJGMLh,1420514065,Bitstamp's Ongoing Outage Echoes Through Bitcoin Economy,"Following news that Bitstamp has suffered what now appears to be a massive security breach, the effects of the surprise outage at one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges have spread quickly through the wider bitcoin economy.  From payment processors serving billion-dollar merchants to bitcoin ATMs and advanced trading platforms, Bitstamp's stoppage caused quoted prices in bitcoin to become inaccurate, some products to be suspended and select services to be retailored in light of the interruption.  The wide-ranging ripple underscores the still-somewhat fragile nature of the bitcoin ecosystem and one that, 10 months removed from the failure of once-dominant Mt Gox, is still striving to eliminate vulnerabilities from its network.  Taariq Lewis, CEO of DigitalTangible, explained for example how users of his bitcoin and precious metals trading platform were shown incorrect prices throughout the day. DigitalTangible functions as a catalog of merchants that resell products, and all are BitPay merchants. With BitPay’s pricing rendered incorrect by Bitstamp's data, he said, customers could have ended up paying more.  While largely academic in his view, Lewis’ speculations point to what he called the “delicacy” of the bitcoin ecosystem, using the impact at the leading US-based bitcoin payments processor as an example:  “If customers are paying $276 and the price is $266, that’s a $10-dollar difference. With 400 merchants processing several hundred thousands of dollars an hour at the wrong price, there’s a risk that BitPay can now be liable for making good on the incorrect price.”  BitPay has since issued a few announcements on the issues its global exchange rate Bitcoin Best Bid (BBB) experienced, first adding more data sources to its engine and later expanding on the subject in a full blog post.  Still, some like BTC.sx CEO Joseph Lee view the situation as evidence that, while increasingly active in terms of the number of players, the bitcoin ecosystem perhaps is overly reliant on certain trusted services.  “Unfortunately for the newcomers in this space, competing with large players isn’t easy when the largest exchanges command. Bitstamp has become a victim of its own success – and the well-timed demise of Mt Gox,” Lee said.  BitPay was not alone in being affected. US-based bitcoin exchange Coinsetter removed Bitstamp as a source of liquidity from its order book, for example, while wallet provider Blockchain began using rival Bitfinex for its pricing data.  Lewis perhaps summed up the total of the outages, stating: “What you’re seeing is a lot of systemic risk in the bitcoin ecosystem.”  Merchant issues limited  Given that bitcoin’s primary use case today may be as a payment mechanism in online commerce, the effects at major merchants are perhaps the most troubling for the network.  BitPay quoted prices that were several dollars higher than the rest of the market for about eight hours on 5th January. During this time, the BitPay price was in line with Bitstamp’s last quoted price of $276.66 before trading stopped.  As a result merchants who use BitPay to process bitcoin payments quoted prices for products that were slightly above the market rate. CoinDesk found that TigerDirect showed a bitcoin-US dollar exchange rate of $276.79 supplied by BitPay when major exchanges were quoting rates in the $270–271 range.  BitPay said in a tweet that the price discrepancy was due to a “frozen” market monitor that required more data sources, without referring to the Bitstamp suspension. The company also declined to comment on its potential liability for pricing issues.  Despite the more theoretical issues raised by commenters, however, the actual impact on BitPay merchant customers appears to have been minimal.  Stephen Macaskill, CEO of BitPay customer and precious metals retailer Amagi Metals indicated that he received no customer complaints about the issue.  “When the bitcoin price drops, bitcoin sales are reduced,” he said. “So, none of our customers were affected by BitPay’s pricing indicator. They were not placing orders during that time.”  Netherlands-based food delivery network provider Takeaway.com also indicated that none of its customers complained about the pricing.  “We didn't get any questions on this subject from our customers,” a spokesperson said.  ATM operators react  At kiosks designed to enable bitcoin buying for purchases in the real-world, effects were also noticeable but limited.  Bitcoin ATM operator Robocoin said it was largely unaffected by the outage, noting that the outage impacted only a small number of its operators.  Robocoin allows its operators to use its Robocoin Exchange Connector as a means to obtain bitcoins for the use in their machines, and those who use the tool can buy from BitPay, Cointrader and Bitstamp.  “Due to Bitstamp's unavailability at the moment, operators may need to manually replenish or liquidate their float in their operator accounts that their machines trade on while they switch the Robocoin Connector to another one of our exchange partners,” Robocoin CTO John Russell said.  Robocoin, however, said it was able to react to the news quickly, issuing an email to its operators after first learning of the issue.  Exchanges feel impact  Online trading was also impacted on at least two notable trading platforms.  A Bitfinex spokesperson also indicated that it saw a number of clients, including enterprise customers, migrate to its platform from Bitstamp, though it suggested it believes that this migration is part of a longer-term trend.  Elsewhere, BTC.sx, which allows users to open positions on Bitfinex, itBit and Bitstamp, for example, disabled the Bitstamp BTC/USD currency pair on the exchange.  “For users with open trades out at Bitstamp, we have suspended our daily funding charge for these positions,” CEO Joe Lee told CoinDesk. “Pending the outcome of the situation, our staff are on hand to issue refunds of any positions opened during this period.”  Lee indicated that any repercussions were limited by his exchange’s decision to diversify the number of exchanges it allowed users to access via its platform, which used to only allow for trading on Bitstamp.  Notably, BTC.sx has experienced similar issues in the past, as it once suspended trading due to the shutdown of Mt Gox in 2014, a development that wasn’t lost on Lee.  His comments suggest that the bitcoin system may be learning from its past mistakes, even if questions are raised about whether centralised exchanges will ultimately be the best way for the network to expand more broadly.  “From BTC.sx's perspective, we saw a skewed dependency on Mt Gox just before its demise and as a result planned from very early on to use multiple exchanges,” he said.
