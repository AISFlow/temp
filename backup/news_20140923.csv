42397961,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEpCb,1411511022,Bitcoin Price Spikes Amid Positive PayPal News,"The price of bitcoin on the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) rose more than 10% today to reach a press-time high of $443.69, its highest total since 18th September.  Prices on the USD BPI were up 11.12% at the time of publication, rising from an open of $398.89 and a low of $391.46 observed at roughly 10:10 BST.  Though there has been much speculation regarding bitcoin's most recent price downturn – with debates raging as to whether widespread merchant adoption and increased industrial mining were adversely affecting price, the latest increase has largely been attributed to a single news event.  Increases in price across nearly all major exchanges were observed from roughly 13:15 BST to 14:30 BST, starting just minutes after news from PayPal, which today revealed that online merchants may now accept bitcoin via digital currency payment processors BitPay, Coinbase and GoCoin on its PayPal Payments Hub platform.  The price had been floating upwards of $460 throughout the month, before a sharper drop on 18th September brought it to a low of $387.76. Until today, the price had hovered around the $400 mark for most of the week.  Raffael Danielli, who follows bitcoin price movements on his personal blog Matlab Trading, suggested that the correlation between the news and the price upswing was inarguable, as evidenced by data charts from major exchanges.  He told CoinDesk:  ""The spike today is a nice example of news hitting the market and how the market reacts.""  Similarly, the price of bitcoin on the CoinDesk CNY BPI rose to a ¥2,717.18 high, an approximate 7.07% hike from the day’s opening price of ¥2,472.20.  USD prices rocket on news  Though most recent price fluctuations have only proved loosely correlated with news, the latest spike is notable as it seems to have directly followed the initial publication of PayPal's partnership by publications such as CoinDesk, Forbes and TechCrunch.  The price of bitcoin on Bitstamp, the world's largest USD bitcoin exchange according to BitcoinCharts, rose wildly from roughly $395.29 at 13:15 BST to $450.00 just one hour later at 14:15 BST.  Prices on Hong Kong-based Bitfinex rose similarly, climbing from roughly $397.06 at 13:15 BST to $445.27 over the next hour.  CNY prices follow suit  Prices on major CNY exchanges followed a similar trajectory as those on major USD exchanges, though prices had declined in the market since hitting peak as of press time.  For example, the price of bitcoin on Huobi rose to ¥2,735 at 14:30 BST, up from ¥2424.70 at 13:15 BST, when prices started to rise on the exchange.  Data from OKCoin, China's largest exchange by volume, shows a similar trajectory.  Market shorting declines  As a positive sign that the latest increase in price may mark a reversal of the most recent downtrend, data from BFXdata showed that there was also a change in how investors were betting on the future prospects of bitcoin today.  Following a sharp uptick in active bitcoin swaps beginning on 20th September, BFXdatahttp://www.bfxdata.com/combined/btc.php illustrated that this market behavior declined precipitously beginning at 14:15 BST.  Bitfinex is one of three major bitcoin exchanges, including BTC-e and OKCoin, that offer margin trading. The investment tool allows investors to short or long the market, effectively placing wagers on the future negative or positive performance of bitcoin.  The decline in total outstanding swaps suggests a number of investors may have closed their short positions on bitcoin, though since the data provides only the total sum it is not known how many traders have closed those positions.

42397954,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEp3k,1411508139,Bitcoin Processors: PayPal Integration Was Months in the Making,"PayPal revealed a series of groundbreaking partnerships earlier today when it announced a broad move to allow digital goods merchants to accept bitcoin payments via its PayPal Payments Hub service.  The move  has so far proved to be an expected though undeniable boon for bitcoin as it pushes toward mainstream acceptance. For example, the eBay-owned payments giant has 143 million registered users as of 2013, though only North American merchants are able to access the new payment methods.  Larger effects on the ecosystem aside, the announcement is also a validation of the major bitcoin payment processors serving the ecosystem – Atlanta-based BitPay, San Francisco-based Coinbase and Santa Monica-based GoCoin – all of which PayPal lauded for their commitment to consumer protections and business models that focus on compliance.  Speaking to CoinDesk, representatives from the three companies confirmed that the PayPal integration had been in the works for months, and that the decision was representative of PayPal's dedication to working in the space.  Coinbase director of business development and strategy Adam White, for example, said that he has been impressed with PayPal and its ability to recognize the value in bitcoin's technology, a sentiment echoed by his peers.  White told CoinDesk:  ""When we were working with PayPal, it wasn't 'What's square one?' It was a team that understood bitcoin, and recognized the potential benefits as well as risks.""  All three companies framed the news as another key step on bitcoin's road to mainstream adoption, and further proof of the digital currency's continued popularity as an emerging payment method.  PayPal's latest advance  Though important for all three of the companies involved, Coinbase's inclusion may be most notable given it made headlines with PayPal subsidiary Braintree earlier this month.  White told CoinDesk that both announcements were developed in tandem, and that the deals arose from the positive statements representatives from eBay and PayPal have issued in the media.  Addressing the existing partnership with Braintree, White indicated he doesn't expect the services to take away from each other. Rather, he said the goal of bitcoin payment processing providers should be to provide their services, wherever merchants are operating.  White said:  ""We think this will build on the partnership we have with Bill Ready and team at Braintree.""  The news marks the first time PayPal or its subsidiaries have worked with either BitPay or GoCoin. However, both reported that they, too, had been engaged with the company's representatives for some months before today's announcement.  GoCoin CEO Steve Beauregard indicated that the news was supposed to be announced in tandem with the Braintree release, but that the decision was held back by the company.  Praising PayPal  BitPay, Coinbase and GoCoin also stressed how impressed they have been with PayPal and its proficiency with bitcoin technology.  Speaking to CoinDesk, BitPay executive chairman Tony Gallippi, for instance, said that he was left with the impression that PayPal is cognizant of many of the issues in the traditional payments space, and that the company is keen to work with bitcoin as a way of opening up a new avenue of addressing them.  Gallippi told CoinDesk:  ""[PayPal] really sees value in the technology, and they're in the business of making payments easy. They're probably just as frustrated with the barriers in traditional payments as anybody.  Gallippi further praised the end product produced by the PayPal team, adding: ""They really understand what it takes and what a customer would go through when they want to make a bitcoin purchase.""  Reaching more customers  Of course, while all three companies have gained another way to enroll merchant customers, they must now compete for this business as well.  White indicated that Coinbase has already opened up conversations with merchants using PayPal's Payment Hub, and that it believes the service will help it onboard clients that don't have the time or resources to invest in a full integration, a sentiment echoed by Gallippi.  Rather than integrating with BitPay, Coinbase or GoCoin directly, for example, PayPal Payment Hub merchants can enable one or all of the processors.  ""You're looking at a product that they've launched that can accept 200 payment methods and you don't have to do 200 integrations,"" Gallippi said. ""You just do it one time and you turn on the different features you want to turn on, so I think there's tremendous value for the merchants to go with a platform like that.""  Beauregard suggested that PayPal's decision to partner with all three companies was a calculated move that would foster growth and competition in the space through the service, creating a better end-product for users.  He added:  ""My own opinion is they didn't want to make a king out of one company.""  Bitcoin-only backing  Though overwhelmingly positive about the news, Beauregard voiced his disappointment that PayPal's endorsement only extended to bitcoin and not any other alternative currency communities.  One of GoCoin's core value propositions is that its service allows merchants to accept litecoin and dogecoin. This positioning has to date appealed to merchants such as BTCTrip, CheapAir and Hustler.  Framing the statement as part of PayPal's decision to cautiously embrace digital currency innovation, Beauregard went on to reiterate his belief that the altcoin community will continue to develop and foster business interest.  Beauregard said:  ""I contend that the altcoins that are coming out are far more advanced than what we've seen so far.""  Beauregard ended by reiterating his hope that PayPal will continue to pay close attention to developments in the digital currency space, and that this isn't the last collaboration between it and the larger ecosystem.

42397956,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEp7g,1411497125,"LHV Bank Talks Coinbase Partnership, Bitcoin's Potential in Europe","New details have emerged about the underlying deal that helped bring Coinbase's bitcoin buying and selling services to 13 European countries.  Representatives from Estonia's LHV Bank confirmed that it is serving as Coinbase's banking provider in the region as it seeks to further its own interests in the digital currency space. Notably, LHV Bank had previously announced a project aimed at exploring the potential of block chain technology.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Andres Kitter, head of retail banking in LHV Bank, framed the partnership as one that finds the bank exploring ways to leverage payments innovations.  Kitter told CoinDesk:  ""Coinbase has a very strong team and we have been encouraged with their approach to risk management and how carefully they manage other sensitive issues. We have been approached by different bitcoin and cryptocurrency companies, however at this stage we still have to be very selective and rather conservative.""  Founded in 1999, LHV Bank's relative newcomer status in country's financial services industry is one of the key reasons it has been more willing to engage the burgeoning bitcoin ecosystem, Kitter said.  To date, LHV Bank has been outspoken about the partnership, first breaking the news via major Estonian daily newspaper Posttimees.  Coinbase has not responded to requests for comment, but has previously suggested it may have more than one banking relationship in the region.  Building on the block chain  Revealing details about its ongoing bitcoin research, Kitter indicated that LHV Bank is seeking to learn what types of services may be built on bitcoin's underlying block chain technology.  The bank is currently experimenting with Colored Coins technology, he explained, a process that allows small amounts of bitcoin to be used as a token that represents an asset, such as a specific investment.  Kitter said:  ""When we started our project, we decided not to focus on bitcoin as a currency or trading asset, we started to explore what could be built on top of the underlying technology. Colored Coins looked most relevant for the use cases we wanted to solve first, although we looked at the other possibilities as well.""  Still, he cautioned that the bank's exploration of the technology is still in its very early stages.  Bitcoin in Estonia  In the interview, Kitter was keen to frame Estonia as a high-tech market that could serve as a great incubator for new technologies, such as mobile payments and digital currencies.  He indicated that domestic lawmakers, as well as agencies such as the Estonian Financial Supervision Authority (FSA) are taking a careful approach to bitcoin. Consumer transactions, Kitter noted are subject to VAT, while those who promote and provide bitcoin services need to follow strict trading regulations.  However, the country could benefit from dedicated domestic support groups, organisations comparable to the Bitcoin Foundation, Chamber of Digital Commerce and Coin Center in the US, he suggested.  Kitter said:  ""As a country, we are at the beginning of the cryptocurrency journey and there isn’t yet a single organization who would step up and drive the conversation with regulators and lawmakers, focus on education, etc. Once that organization is in place, we would expect improvement.""  Kitter concluded that LHV Bank is still monitoring the local landscape, but that it is committed to working with digital currencies.  ""We are taking small steps and working with strong partners like Coinbase,"" he said.

42397957,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEp6h,1411492759,PayPal Announces First Partnerships in Bitcoin Space,"PayPal has announced partnerships with three major payment processors in the bitcoin space – BitPay, Coinbase and GoCoin.  Though the online e-commerce pioneer stopped short of integrating bitcoin into its digital wallet or payment processing services directly, the move marks PayPal's first formal offering to the bitcoin community.  In a blog post penned by senior director of corporate strategy Scott Ellison, PayPal revealed that online merchants will now be able to accept bitcoin via all three companies through its PayPal Payments Hubhttps://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/merchant-services-hub, its product that enables customers to accept credit cards, mobile carrier payments and other payment methods through a single integration.  Ellison lauded BitPay, Coinbase and GoCoin for their commitment to ensuring consumer protections on their platforms, while suggesting that the offering will appeal to a number of its key customer groups, writing:  ""We believe digital goods merchants will be excited to work with these industry-leading companies to sell ringtones, games and music and get paid with bitcoin.""  Notably, the announcement follows the decision of PayPal subsidiary Braintree to partner with Coinbase earlier this month.  PayPal is available in 193 markets and 26 currencies. With 143 million active registered accounts and $6.6bn in revenue at the end of 2013, the e-commerce giant brings the potential for new users and new business to the bitcoin economy.  Embracing innovation  Ellison went on to suggest that PayPal is committed to embracing innovation, and that this has lead to its early support of bitcoin. Further, he suggested the company will be monitoring its first formal bitcoin trial to assess how it moves forward with the payment method, writing:  ""We’re proceeding gradually, supporting bitcoin in some ways today and holding off on other ways until we see how things develop.""  PayPal cited its commitment to allowing businesses freedom of choice and promoting safer buying experiences as key reasons for its decision.  BitPay, Coinbase and GoCoin will pay a referral fee to PayPal for new business they gain through the platform, meaning their existing pricing structures will be unaffected by the move.  Support for select business models  Ellison framed the decision as the latest way PayPal is seeking to support the bitcoin ecosystem, pointing to its past efforts to help companies in the bitcoin mining space accept PayPal for their products.  However, Ellison suggested that PayPal is conscious of the controversies that have dominated this segment of the bitcoin industry, and that its support will continue for merchants that meet certain criteria, writing:  ""To safeguard customers, we’ve decided not to work with merchants who pre-sell these products. This is consistent with our approach to pre-sales of other goods; we hold off anytime we determine that pre-selling may not provide a good buyer experience.""  In recent months, a number of bitcoin mining companies, including early and current market leaders such as Butterfly Labs and CoinTerra have faced lawsuits from customers for failing to deliver equipment on advertised timelines.  Addressing security concerns  In his statements, Ellison also suggested that PayPal has been monitoring conversation surrounding how bitcoin will be regulated, clarifying that PayPal will only seek to work with bitcoin companies that offer certain consumer protections.  Reitterating that PayPal needs to follow local laws and regulations in every market it serves, Eillson wrote:  ""For this reason, virtual currency exchangers and administrators interested in working with PayPal in the future must secure the appropriate licenses and put anti-money laundering procedures in place.""  PayPal also stated that while other cryptocurrencies have been available for some time ""only bitcoin has achieved significant scale"" in the payments space to date.

42397942,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEotu,1411487333,US Government Shuts Down Embattled Mining Firm Butterfly Labs,"Mining hardware maker Butterfly Labs has been shut down by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which accused the embattled company of fraud and public misrepresentation.  On 18th September, the agency was granted permission by the US District Court for the Western District of Missouri to freeze Butterfly Labs’ assets and close the company pending trial, according to documents released by the FTC.  The move comes months after customers began sending complaints to the federal agency, a process that produced nearly 300 filings accusing the company of delaying shipments and refund payments.  Jessica Rich, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that the focus is now on seeking restitution for Butterfly Labs customers, adding:  “We often see that when a new and little-understood opportunity like bitcoin presents itself, scammers will find ways to capitalize on the public’s excitement and interest. We’re pleased the court granted our request to halt this operation, and we look forward to putting the company’s ill-gotten gains back in the hands of consumers.”  'Threat to public interest'  The FTC filing centered primarily on Butterfly Labs’ continued stonewalling of customers who did not receive mining products after the company announced that they had been shipped. It noted that during the last two years, Butterfly Labs consistently failed to deliver products or services that had been paid for upfront, including cloud mining contracts.  According to the agency, Butterfly Labs violated Section 5(a) of the FTC Act by engaging in “unfair or deceptive business practices in or affecting commerce”. The FTC said that in both its direct sales pitches and in all advertising materials, the company misled consumers on its ability to provide a legitimate service.  Combined, the agency wrote in its filing, these actions constitute a threat to consumer safety, justifying the closure of the company and the seizure of its assets.  The FTC said:  “Consumers have suffered and will continue to suffer substantial injury as a result of Defendant’s violations of the FTC Act. In addition, Defendants have been unjustly enriched as a result of their unlawful acts or practices. Absent injunctive relief by this Court, Defendants are likely to continue to injure consumers, reap unjust enrichment, and harm the public interest.”  The agency requested that Butterfly Labs be placed in receivership and its operations be suspended in order to cease all activity.

42397951,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEozo,1411480341,Vietnam Exchange Adds Bitcoin Wallet with Off-Chain Transactions,"Vietnam's premier exchange Bitcoin Vietnam Co Ltd has added wallet functionality in a bid to make storage simpler and encourage day-to-day digital currency spending in the country.  Notably, users of Bitcoin Vietnam Wallet will be able to send bitcoins to others on the platform in instant 'off-chain' transactions using recipients' bitcoin or email addresses. Off-chain transactions occur near instantly, outside the bitcoin block chain with its delayed confirmation times.  Users will also be able to sell the bitcoins in their wallets directly on the Bitcoin Vietnam exchange, without needing to switch between them.  Empowering product  Wallets are secured with mandatory two-factor authentication with a multi-level storage system that keeps a certain percentage in cold storage.  Bitcoin Vietnam  CEO Nguyen Tran Bao Phuong said the wallet would help empower Vietnam's economic players with their ""specific needs"", describing the country as one of the world's most ambitious emerging markets with a very young workforce.  There is ""palpable economic progress every year,"" she added.  ""The high-tech startup scene may be – compared internationally – still in its beginnings, but especially in a city like Saigon you can grasp this terrific spirit of optimism and the will to overcome the still existent shortcomings in our society through technological innovation and entrepreneurial spirit.""  COO Dominik Weil said it was sometimes daunting for newcomers to bitcoin to understand the basics of secure storage, something that needs to be overcome before new users even consider exchanges. Bitcoin Vietnam's wallet, he continued, seeks to lower the entrance hurdle. He also noted that a wallet has been one of the features most commonly requested by users.  Weil told CoinDesk that Vietnam has several specific conditions that could make bitcoin's success easier there. 45% of the population is under 25, the country's middle class is expanding and growing wealthier every year, and use of technologies like smartphones is growing exponentially.  ""Electronic payments are still a problem (if people purchase online, they often still have to wire the money via a bank transfer which they initiate locally at their bank branch) credit card fraud is the highest in the region... it is a country that still lacks a lot of infrastructure – but on the other hand, the development is crazily fast and you can observe change here on a monthly basis. People want to catch up with the world and innovation gets adopted into daily life pretty fast.""  Asian societies were in general hungrier for development and change, and thus offered a better environment for entrepreneurs looking to execute ideas, he added.  Building a bitcoin economy  Bitcoin in Vietnam is still in relative infancy, and its local infrastructure is not yet as sophisticated as more economically liberal countries. So far, only a few local companies and brick-and-mortar traders have started accepting the digital currency for payments.  However, thanks to a combined effort involving locals and entrepreneurs from countries like Germany, Israel and Singapore, Vietnam still has a choice of international-standard cryptocurrency services and a live open-book exchange called VBTChttps://www.vbtc.vn/ – which is also operated by Bitcoin Vietnam Co Ltd.  Despite an uncertain start, Vietnam's regulators have also made progress with bitcoin in recent months. The State Bank of Vietnam is currently working in cooperation with the relevant unit of the Department of Public Security to define appropriate regulations for bitcoin usage.  Bitcoin Vietnam Co Ltd and VBTC have also participated in discussions with the authorities. Furthermore, formation of a local chapter of the international Bitcoin Foundation is planned in the near future.  Bitcoin Vietnam launched in March this year with a fixed-price bitcoin brokerage, and has expanded since then. Its services are available in Vietnamese, English and German.

42397946,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEowr,1411474723,Hedge Fund GABI Makes First Bitcoin Purchase via DigitalBTC,"The Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund (GABI) has completed its first initial offer period and made its first purchase of bitcoin, according to the company.  While the amount of cyptocurrency purchased has not been announced, it is clear that the fund delayed the move to make the most of the current decrease in the bitcoin price.  GABI  is incorporated in the island of Jersey and is possibly the world’s first regulated bitcoin investment fund.  Transparency and compliance  GABI made the decision to execute its first bitcoin purchase via digitalBTC, Australia’s first publicly listed bitcoin company.  Daniel Masters, director of GABI and co-founder of Global Advisors Jersey Limited (GAJL), which set up the fund, explains:  “We are delighted to have executed our initial over-the-counter bitcoin purchase with digitalBTC and we look forward to expanding our relationship as GABI’s assets grow. DigitalBTC offers GABI valuable liquidity and price discovery while being a strong counterparty.""  Bill Brindise, digitalBTC chief investment officer, said the company’s digitalX Direct platform is specifically designed to provide real-time liquidity for institutional investors and large commercial operators who choose to purchase bitcoins.  “As a publicly listed company, subject to strict reporting and disclosure requirements, we are also very pleased to be dealing with GABI, given their licensing regime and look forward to being able to provide similar liquidity in future,” said Brindise.  Bank crackdown  Jersey – along with another British island, the Isle of Man – is a self-regulating British crown dependency and a tax haven for many financial operators.  Both islands have been touting themselves as attractive, regulated locations for the location of bitcoin businesses in recent months, with some success.  However, the Isle of Man lost some of its appeal last week, as banks decided to cut their ties with the island’s cryptocurrency sector. This caused the local middleman, banking solution provider Capital Treasury Services (CTS), to close all crypto-related accounts, causing shockwaves in the industry. Another solution does seem to be in the pipeline now, however.  Masters told CoinDesk that GABI is connected with a number of businesses that were using the CTS system in the Isle of Man.  “We had our reservations about how all that structure was set up. It seems that the ultimate banks making the payments were not open to cryptocurrency businesses. CTS was forming a kind of a barrier, but ultimately they saw through that,” he said.“We anticipated that and that is why we delayed for a while.”  The need for regulation  When it comes to regulation, Masters views it pragmatically, as a necessary step in the evolution of bitcoin:  “The best scenario for bitcoin is that there is a bridge between the bitcoin world and the world of traditional finance. Unless there is a working relationship, it will just slow down the development of bitcoin dramatically.”  The fund pointed out that the recent bitcoin price weakness can be attributed to a series of factors, including the CTS issue on the Isle of Man, troubles with the New York 'BitLicense' programme and recent Russian Treasury comments.  “We timed our entry to the bitcoin market accordingly. We believe the resulting entry point represents an opportune moment to initiate our first round of capital deployment,” the fund said in a statement.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/09/23/hedge-fund-gabi-makes-first-bitcoin-purchase-via-digitalbtc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/abe879d57ce63074a0435a879b5069876d282ecd-1250x703.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397944,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEout,1411465818,CEX.io Launches US Dollar Deposits and Trading Pairs,"Bitcoin exchange operator and GHash.io owner CEX.io has announced the public beta of its fiat currency integration, beginning with the US dollar.  CEX.io  said that the new service, which will allow US dollar deposits via bank transfer or payment card, will eventually include other fiat currencies like the euro. In addition, the exchange plans on adding new trading pairs in the weeks ahead, including US dollar pairs for darkcoin and dogecoin.  The fiat integration is the latest service announcement to come out of the UK-based company, which launched a developer API last week and has been preparing to add new trading pairs since April.  CEX.io chief editor Helga Danova said that the fiat service would likely be expanded in the future as part of a broader overhaul of its exchange. The company told CoinDesk that, over the next year, it will be making significant investments in its exchange platform with an eye on targeting international investors and traders.  Danova said:  “We are planning to improve CEX.io as an exchange. After the workflow of USD and euro is aligned, we will support other fiat currencies as well. CNY is likely to follow up the path after supporting the euro.”  How it works  Like other platforms that allow USD deposits, CEX.io will be utilizing identity verification and two-factor security to support the new feature.  Though trading pairs will only feature USD for now, CEX.io said that any fiat currencies are acceptable for payment, saying:  “At the moment, these funds are automatically converted into USD for further trading and withdrawing funds. To avoid any possible issues and speed up the process, we recommend passing identity verification.”  According to the company, the process is as streamlined as possible, with fiat and digital currency management available.  Bridging currencies amid tough climate  By adding fiat currencies, CEX.io will join the list of exchanges that are likely to be targeted by whatever regulatory frameworks emerge from the discussions now taking place between policy makers and government officials worldwide.  The UK government is currently researching and developing a public policy stance toward digital currencies. Proposed regulatory frameworks like the BitLicense also point to the likelihood that fiat-handling exchanges will experience more oversight in the future, an idea supported by academics such as Google Asia public policy analyst Andy Yee.  Danova told CoinDesk that fiat integration wasn’t always easy, saying:  “Lots of traditional financial institutions have prejudices against bitcoin businesses, which is quite natural, but still creates timing barriers and delays with negotiations. The same goes with setting everything up according to legislation in different countries.”  She noted that conversations with regulators and payments companies continue to evolve and will no doubt impact future fiat rollouts.

The announcement comes at a time of increasing activity in the UK digital currency exchange space, as new exchange services such as Yacuna and Bitok have launched in recent weeks.  Founded in 2013, Bittylicious is one of the oldest exchange services in the UK, facing notable competition from Coinfloor. Bittylicious sells blackcoin, dogecoin, darkcoin, feathercoin, maxcoin, peercoin, quarkcoin, StartCOIN, vertcoin and worldcoin.  Existing security applies  Warne stressed that altcoin buyers will be subject to the same security procedures as bitcoin buyers.  Users first need to upload an ID, Warne explained, which is then vetted by card processors. The process will take about one business day and serves as an added safeguard against fraud.  Bittylicious users also need to provide their own wallet for all bitcoin and altcoin transactions. For a more in-depth overview, Warne suggested prospective users review its online 'Bitcoin Buying Guide' for more details.  Evolving payment options  Warne suggested that credit card payments have remained a popular payment option at Bittylicious since their introduction, and that he does not see enabling credit card payments as contradictory to the larger goals of bitcoin.  Rather, Warne suggested that supporting more payment options is good for the ecosystem as it encourages more buyers to enter the community.  ""Many people that either want to make a purchase without having to log in using their online banking, or want to make larger purchases, are happy to pay a little extra to use their card,"" he added.  Going forward, Warne said Bittylicious plans to streamline its card process and increase the number of local payment methods to European markets.
