42426594,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuGDh,1450378013,"Japanese Regulators Mull Data Collection, Audits for Bitcoin Exchanges","New details have emerged about a proposed regulatory framework for bitcoin exchanges in Japan.  As reported yesterday  , a working group within the country's Financial Services Agency (FSA), its top finance regulator, has developed a series of recommendations for overseeing exchanges in the country.  The proposal is said to be moving toward completion, and will be submitted to Japan’s national legislature, the Diet, for consideration next year. The working group is part of a body within the FSA called the Financial System Council.  When asked for comment, the FSA provided CoinDesk with a Japanese-language version of the draft text, which includes proposals for regulating various aspects of Japan’s financial system. These include prepaid cards, ATMs and digital currency exchanges.  A rough translation of the document shows that the government is considering ways in which existing financial statutes can be applied to those operating exchanges in Japan, as well as how it is looking to international examples as it considers regulation.  Included in the draft proposal is a suggestion that a 2007 law called the Act on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds be applied to domestic exchanges. By doing so, exchanges in Japan would be required to collect and maintain data on customers, and provide information regarding suspicious activity to Japanese authorities.  Capital requirements, mandates for client fund segregation and external audits are also included in the group’s recommendations.  The 2014 collapse of Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt Gox and the arrest of its CEO, Mark Karpeles, is referenced in the document as a justification for requiring exchanges to provide detailed information to both regulators and their customers, as well as a basis for overseeing the industry as a whole.  According to the text, the working group is looking at ways in which regulation can be crafted so as to not overburden startups working in an emerging industry. Further, the proposal suggests that self-regulation should be encouraged among exchanges, calling for the creation of a body to promote that effort.  The FSA told CoinDesk that an English-language copy of the text will be published early next year.

42426586,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuFzh,1450365839,How Provenance is Channeling the Blockchain for Social Good,"Aside from its budding use case in overhauling mainstream finance, blockchain technology has also been lauded for the way in which it can help enact social good.  Jessi Baker, CEO and founder of London-based startup Provenance, established in the summer of 2013, is hoping to channel the potential of distributed ledgers to do just that.  Alongside heading Provenance, Baker is also undertaking a PHD investigating new technologies to build more transparency into supply chains – the lack of which, she said, brings aboutmost of the world's social and environmental problems.  ""One of the big culprits of that failure is in the global supply chains,"" she told CoinDesk in a recent interview. ""We have seen products that are still being done by slaves, environments being destroyed by the production of consumer goods.""  For Baker, consumers or companies are not inherently bad for purchasing products that have not been ethically produced. Instead, she argued, the issue resides with the lack of information available to people wanting to make those purchases.  This is where the blockchain technology comes in.  ""What we see is really exciting with the blockchain in that there is finally a method of perhaps gathering this data from far-flung areas where products are being produced and having that connected to an open ledger that isn't governed by anyone,"" said Baker. ""So, it can be committed there and also help people who are already gathering that information to do so in a more interoperable way from the get-go, such as certificates, for example.""  Building transparency  Provenance sets out to help businesses become more transparent, both on a business and product level.  ""More recently we have been looking on an item level, so looking specifically at tracking and being more transparent about what is going on with individual items,"" said Baker.  The objective in doing so, she added, is two-fold: greater transparency will translate in increased information for consumers about the product's provenance, but it will also serve to build trust in brands and producers that behave well.  To this end, Provenance is building on both the bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. However, Baker was quick to discuss the benefits of using the latter.  ""So, with bitcoin, we can do a certain degree of stuff: we can track assets through a chain of custody, for example ... but when you start to look at consensus mechanisms – such as, is this product organic – and therefore carrying that certification along the chain ... Ethereum lends itself a little bit better.""  Fish on the blockchain  Provenance has been working with various small- and medium-sized enterprises in the UK to test how the platform performs and is looking to expand abroad with an upcoming pilot. This will see it put ""the first fish on the blockchain"" in the coming year.  Baker said:  ""We are just embarking on a large pilot, which is in the fish industry, we are going to be announcing quite soon who all of our partners are on that ... that's kind of our first big project.""  Although she declined to divulge specifics, she said that the project would see her team work with fisherman in Indonesia who catch pole and line-caught tuna for the Japanese sashimi market.  As part of the endeavour, Provenance is set to work with a local NGO, charged with verifying the produce's social and environmental sustainability. The token – in this case holding the provenance information of the fish – would get carried along the blockchain throughout the whole supply chain until it reaches its destination in Japan.  This will allow consumers to observe the produce's attributes, such as its freshness, the day it was caught and whether the produce has been handled in a socially and environmentally compliant manner.  ""It kind of gives you this extra dimension to the old shashimi,"" Baker commented.  The challenges  Aside from helping to build transparency by leveraging distributed ledger technology, Baker told CoinDesk that Provenance is also seeking to make bitcoin's underlying technology far more available outside of FinTech.  She said:  ""I think we've made [blockchain technology] accessible to perhaps a wider audience. In terms of just generally designers, design students, business people who perhaps couldn't think of a way that they might be able to use the technology and then seeing an application like ours is not just finance and that kind of stuff.""  Provenance's quest to drive awareness about blockchain technology, however, does not come without its own set of challenges.  The issue, Baker thinks, is that currently the industry is fairly dominated by financial services but also ""anarchists, super geeks and greedy venture capitalists"".  In order for the use of the technology to prevail, Barker said that more diversity is required. ""I think that unless we add diversity to that ecosystem, it's going to be a slower uptake before we start to see some real-world, useful application outside of finance,"" she said.  Baker is personally excited by what blockchains can do in general, primarily in terms of legal frameworks, trust frameworks and the Internet.  ""I think at the moment we are not even scratching the surface for its potential because I think there isn't enough diversity in the ecosystem yet to really uncover those ideas,"" she said.  An asset for authenticity  Provenance, Baker said, is fully funded until 2017 following the procurement of various grants, including funding from Innovate UK and the European Union's Horizon 20/20 fund.  ""This year has been a big year for us,"" she said. At the moment, the startup is upheld by five full-time staff and five freelancers, but Baker said there are plans in the pipeline to continue growing and developing its permanent workforce.  Provenance, she explained, has gone from being a side-project, undertaken along with her studies, to now becoming a full-time endeavour.  ""It's not just blockchain stuff ... [we are doing] a lot of data stuff, helping people gather, organise and convey information for their supply chain. The blockchain is a really great asset for the authenticity layer,"" she said.

42426589,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuG5h,1450342853,12 More Banks Join Blockchain Consortium R3,"UPDATE (17th December 14:25 BST): This article has been updated with additional information.      Twelve additional banks have joined the blockchain consortium led by startup R3CEV.  New entrants to the group include Banco Santander, Danske Bank, Intesa Sanpaolo, Natixis, Nomura, Northern Trust, OP Financial Group, Scotiabank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, US Bancorp, Westpac Banking Corporation and BMO Financial Group.  The consortium, announced in September, is focused on proof-of-concept experimentation and the development of standards for blockchain tech. Its creation followed a series of workshops and meetings conducted with banks, some of which later signed on to the group.  The consortium’s membership has grown since the first nine members were announced in the fall. In the past few months, 33 more banks have joined the initiative. With the new entrants, the total number of banks involved with the consortium rises to 42.  R3 indicated that its ""initial window"" for membership into the consortium has closed, but said that in 2016 it will seek to work with non-bank financial institutions and groups.  The firm struck a positive tone, pointing to broadening support for the technology among the world's banks, some of which are conducting their own investigations in tandem with the consortium's work.  R3 CEO David Rutter said that the possible applications of these its solutions will ""cut across asset classes, geographies and market participants"".  He added in a statement:  ""Ultimately, these technologies will benefit not just financial services firms, but their clients and end-users as well. We're very excited to be at the forefront of this global evolution.""  When reached for comment, Banco Santander said that the organization presents an opportunity ""to work together in a collaborative way in order to build new financial technology platforms based on crypto currencies and distributed ledger techniques"".  ""Santander is keen to contribute to this collaborative effort to shape the new rails upon which the financial industry will operate in the future,"" it said.

42426582,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuFph,1450331503,IBM Creates Open-Source Blockchain With Linux and Big Banks,"Tech giant IBM has launched an open-source blockchain along with the support of financial incumbents including JP Morgan, the London Stock Exchange and Wells Fargo as well as tech specialists such as Cisco and Intel.  Reports by Wired and Fortune indicate that IBM was the leader in creating what will be called the Open Ledger Project, an alternative blockchain system to be overseen by the Linux Foundation, the nonprofit consortium that runs the open-source operating system.  The Open Ledger Project is described as a development library that will allow businesses to build custom distributed ledger solutions, without needing to rely on open, public blockchains such as those offered by bitcoin and Ethereum.  IBM Fellow Jerry Cuomo told Fortune that he sees the Open Ledger Project as an expansion of bitcoin’s capabilities, telling the news source:  “I don’t have a strong opinion on cryptocurrencies, but I have a strong opinion on the blockchain as a solution for contracts and supply chains and the Internet of Things. I think bitcoin is an interesting application for blockchain but there are thousands of applications and wider use cases beyond that.”  IBM is reportedly contributing “thousands of lines of existing code” from its research so far into the distributed ledger space, while Digital Asset, the blockchain startup helmed by former JP Morgan executive Blythe Masters, will ""contribute its Hyperledger name"" to the branding of the effort and provide development resources.  Companies involved in the effort include Accenture, ANZ Bank, CLS, Credits, Digital Asset, Fujitsu, Initiative for CryptoCurrencies and Contracts, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, State Street, SWIFT, VMware and Wells Fargo.  Collaborative future  While the big names attached to the project will likely lead it to be initially embraced, reports suggest the path forward for its development is unclear.  Of the companies affiliated with the Open Ledger Project, Wired reported that only DAH and IBM are contributing to the development efforts, though as an open-source project, it will be open to any and all participants.  Further, IBM's Cuomo distanced the effort from the idea that any one blockchain will come to dominate the market.  ""Like with the web, there is no one thing to rule them all,"" he told Wired, adding:  ""There is no one blockchain to rule them all. There will be multiple implementations of the blockchain. And it will be a sin if they don't interoperate and work together.""  Elsewhere, Jim Zemlin, executive director at the Linux Foundation, lauded the collaboration on the project as necessary given that the technology is still new and ""highly complex"".  ""Blockchain demands a cross-industry, open-source collaboration to advance the technology for all,"" he said in a statement to Bloomberg.

42426588,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuG3h,1450329863,"DBS, Standard Chartered Develop Distributed Ledger for Trade Finance","Singapore's DBS Bank has reportedly partnered with multinational banking firm Standard Chartered to create a distributed ledger project for trade finance.  Bloomberg reports  officials at both firms stated today that they have completed initial testing for the idea, and that they are seeking to collaborate with other firms on the initiative in 2016.  While light on details, the article went on to indicate that DBS and Standard Chartered were considering various distributed ledger technologies to achieve project goals.  The article reads:  “In pursuing the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, Standard Chartered and DBS are developing a new approach that could transform the trade finance business by speeding up banking transactions, while cutting costs and boosting transparency.”  Standard Chartered had previously announced its interest in this use case for the technology in a July blog post by chief innovation officer Anju Patwardhan.  Similarly, the announcement coincides with an rise in interest in this use case among industry startups, with firms including Wave and SKUchain working to disrupt the estimated $14tn industry.  Both banks have been reportedly investigating applications for the technology as early as May of this year, according to a blog post by Todd McDonald, CEO of the blockchain consortium R3CEV.  At the time, McDonald suggested that Singapore would be a likely initial testing ground for the technology given the size of the city-state and its reliance on cross-border payments.
