42380187,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MMxd,1514583081,Payment Provider Bitrefill Runs Successful Lightning Transaction Test,"Faster and cheaper bitcoin transactions may soon go alive.  A recent transaction posted on Twitter from inside the offices of prepaid phone payment provider, Bitrefill, used the Lightning network to top up a mobile (for real) at near instant speed with zero fee, as the Tweet touted.  While such transaction is not yet generally available to the public and may still be largely limited to command line interfaces, it nonetheless gives a peek into how the future may look like for regular bitcoin users.  Lightning has been one of the most watched bitcoin-scaling solutions. It's a new layer of abstraction atop the bitcoin protocol that allows transactions to occur more quickly and cheaply, without sacrificing the security. According to data site Bitinfocharts, currently the average transaction fee of bitcoin is at $36.  Yet, people who saw Bosworth's tweet may have been confused because the use case isn't visible to Bitrefill customers. According to CEO Sergej Kotliar, the transaction shown occurred when Bosworth was testing out Bitrefill's implementation with one of the company's developers, by invitation. Bosworth needed to refill his phone at the time anyway, so he decided to test it with real money. It worked.  Kotliar said:  ""Everything is ready to go on our end, but we're not launching it yet until a Lightning wallet is released for general use on mainnet.""  Wallets need to be updated in order to interact with the Lightning protocol layer, and this has not generally happened yet, Kotliar explained.  Bitrefill announced it was implementing Lightning in August, on its blog. Interested users and developers are able to test it now, with fake bitcoin.  Based in Stockholm, Bitrefill primarily focused on enabling people to pay for prepaid phones with cryptocurrency. ""Our high-level company vision is to enable people all over the world to use bitcoin as money. Practically we enable people to use their coins to buy everything that is digital and money-like, so pay their bills, refill their phones, vouchers, etc,"" its CEO told CoinDesk in an email.  Noting that production implementations of new innovations often surface tricky problems, the small team at Bitrefill decided one way it could contribute to bitcoin was to move quickly to adopt Lightning, but doing so also helped it to address frequent concerns voiced by its consumers around transaction costs and delays.  ""Recent mempool overloads have affected us hard, but over time a bigger concern for us has been confirmation times,"" Kotliar wrote. ""Here the instant transactions of lightning lets us make a truly great customer experience. Lightning solves not only confirmation times but also many other UX problems of bitcoin.""  Kotliar urged peer companies not to wait to implement Lightning. He wrote:  ""Integration with Lightning has been surprisingly easy. It runs in a way similar to how bitcoin works, and fits neatly with how our and many company wallets work already.""

42380186,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MMsb,1514574955,Blockchain in Healthcare: 2017's Successes,"Katherine Kuzmeskas is the CEO of SimplyVital Health, a blockchain firm seeking to bring security and transparency to hospitals and physician groups through technology.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.          Entering 2018, two things are clear – 1) healthcare is ripe for disruption and 2) there is a massive opportunity for blockchain technology to lead this transformation.      From medical records to the pharmaceutical supply chain to smart contracts for payment distribution, there are plenty of opportunities to leverage blockchain technology in healthcare. At the end of 2017, however, you'd be forgiven for thinking there hasn't been much progress.      As an innovator working on this use case, though, I can say this is far from the case.      Looking at three examples below, it is easy to identify why these projects have been successful: ""big hairy audacious goals"" rooted in initial practical implementations.      While it may be difficult to hear, healthcare is a business. When making purchasing decisions, for-profit and not-for-profit healthcare companies need to use the same logic every firm does, by asking, ""How will this product bring efficiency or savings?""      The three companies below brought their products to market by focusing on an immediate, existing need in healthcare that had an existing business model opportunity.    The MediLedger Project    Led by The LinkLab and Chronicled, the MediLedger Project kicked off in 2017, successfully bringing competing pharmaceutical manufacturers and wholesalers to the same table. Together, they designed and implemented a process for using blockchain technology to improve the track-and-trace capabilities for prescription medicine.      Built to support the requirements of the U.S. Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA), MediLedger also outlines steps to build an electronic, interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs, meaning it successfully met not just the law, but the operational needs of industry.      Two key takeaways: the vision for the industry is an open system architecture, with nodes operated by a variety of key companies in the industry – supply chain participants, service providers for the industry and trusted technology companies.      To make this open network happen, those involved were able to develop a blockchain solution that allows full privacy, no leakage of business intelligence, while still allowing the capability of drug verification and provenance reporting.      The working group will continue in 2018 to develop the vision and governance for such an industry platform as well as launch a commercial solution. They will continue to explore how such a platform could transform the pharmaceutical supply chain.      Learn more here.    SimplyVital Health    Launched in February 2017, we started with what we considered a practical implementation of blockchain: an audit trail.      Our product, ConnectingCare brings providers together from different clinical organizations onto the same platform, where they can view the same data for shared patients. Financial and clinical algorithms powered by AI provide actionable strategic opportunities for all users.      Together, providers work to drive down the cost of care, which means providers are paid for working together and for results. Because reimbursement depends on the ability to prove they worked together, the immutable audit trail provides extra upside for the users.      Now with a track record of credibility, we are building Health Nexus: the blockchain infrastructure and protocol we hope will be safely adoptable by healthcare. A fork of ethereum, the offering combines a new validation and governance protocol focusing on HIPAA compliance and a key pair system built into the protocol for safe data sharing.      Up first is linking and growing ConnectingCare, and then developing healthcare data marketplace, which is the most requested feature by our community.      Learn more here.    Robomed Network    Robomed Network is a decentralized medical network designed to provide the most effective medical care. The project's uniqueness lies in connecting healthcare service providers and patients, based on a smart contract, the value criteria of which are the clinical pathways.      This particular breakthrough concept of focusing on patient outcomes is brand new to the healthcare market. In other words, Robomed Network is the first system where the patient pays for the result and not the medical process itself.      Launched first in Russia and Dubai, Robomed boasts nearly 9,000 patients, 30,500 services and nearly $2 million worth of services. As the healthcare market continues to shift to value-based care (payment for results instead of payment for number of procedures), solutions such as Robomed that bridge the gap between provider and patient, will continue to gain traction.

42380178,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MMnZ,1514570413,Indian Finance Ministry: Cryptocurrencies Are 'Like Ponzi Schemes',"The Indian government is doubling down on its already public skepticism of cryptocurrencies.  In a new statement issued Dec. 29, India's Ministry of Finance warned residents against the risks associated with trading cryptocurrencies, going so far as to compare blockchain-based assets like bitcoin to ""Ponzi schemes."" The statement is the third warning this year from a government body in India, indicating a growing level of concern among top regulators in the country.  As reported by CoinDesk, the Reserve Bank of India has issued two similar warnings in 2017, one in February and another earlier this December, to people who hold and trade cryptocurrencies.  Yet, the new statement from the Finance Minister again shows how the government is responding to the worldwide spike in the price of various cryptocurrencies.  It reads:  ""The price of bitcoin and other [virtual currencies] therefore is entirely a matter of mere speculation resulting in spurt and volatility in their prices. There is a real and heightened risk of investment bubble of the type seen in Ponzi schemes... Consumers need to be alert and extremely cautious as to avoid getting trapped in such Ponzi schemes.""  Elsewhere in the notice, the Ministry emphasized that India doesn't recognize any cryptocurrency as a legal tender and that no license is issued in the country to authorize any cryptocurrency exchange. Therefore, users will bear the potential financial, operational, legal and security related risks when investing in cryptocurrencies, it said.  Such a note may be directly addressed to existing traders of cryptocurrencies in India, as data from CoinMarketCap shows that a more prominent cryptocurrency exchange in India, Koinex, currently sees a $115 million trading volume within 24 hours.  Warning asides, though, what's also notable is the ongoing discussion in India whether and how cryptocurrencies should be regulated in the country.  India's Supreme Court has previously urged various government agencies to respond to an online petition that demands a proper regulation over bitcoin.  In fact, in August, it was noted that a cryptocurrency regulation proposal had been submitted to the Finance Ministry, but that the content and timeline of such regulation still remained unclear. As such, the new statement from the government body may still signal a more restrictive rule.

At press time, the token, used for transactions on the San Francisco startup's RippleNet cryptocurrency network, reached $1.87, a figure that was nearly double its listed price last week, data shows. The price rally arrived after a long period of inactivity in the market, which had held steady at $0.20 over the past six months.  As a result, the market capitalization of XRP is now catching up with those of ethereum and bitcoin, according to data site CoinMarketCap. XRP is now the third largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, with the value of its combined token supply now $72 billion.  Data from CoinDesk indicates that much of today's price improvement comes from today's morning trading session (UTC 06:01 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.), where it recorded a 14.43 percent increase in the last six hours.  What's also notable is that global trading volume of XRP within 24 hours predominantly came from exchanges based in South Korea.  Data from CoinMarketCap shows that three South Korean exchanges, Bithumb, Coinone and Korbit account for 31.5, 7.3, and 2.07 percent of the worldwide XRP trading, respectively. In addition, within these exchanges, each has more than half of its trading activities concentrating on XRP, data also shows.  The price rally also follows the South Korea government's newly issued policy that will ban cryptocurrency exchanges from allowing anonymous accounts, a move to curb market speculation in the country.

42380195,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MN7h,1514554223,"From $900 to $20,000: Bitcoin's Historic 2017 Price Run Revisited","Bitcoin 2017  The chart above says it all.  One year ago as of the time of writing, the price of bitcoin traded between $930 and $978 – movements that perhaps set the stage for the cryptocurrency's value to cross the $1,000 on New Year's Day. Indeed, that headline-making development would be the first of many to come for 2017.  In this article, we look at some of the major moments for bitcoin's price during the last 12 months, a period of time that saw the price of bitcoin climb from below $1,000 to nearly $20,000 on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  It was a year that arguably exceeded last year's bullish predictions and one that saw unprecedented interest coming from places – particularly in the finance industry – that some may not have imagined possible just 12 months ago.  The PBOC impact  While January started off with bitcoin price fireworks, that month would also see one of the defining regulatory moments of 2017: an initial move by the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, to tighten its oversight of the country's then-dominant bitcoin exchanges.  Yet, the warnings from Chinese officials didn't cause the market death blow that some observers feared.  However, it did lead to a drop in trading volume as a result of the imposition of new trading fees by what were then the ""Big Three"" exchanges – Huobi, OKCoin and BTCC. Those exchanges later halted withdrawals following new edicts from the PBoC, ultimately closing fiat trading this fall following further restrictions from Chinese regulators.  The 'no' heard round the world  Investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss first filed to launch a bitcoin exchange-traded fund back in 2013, setting the stage for a multi-year journey that led to the March 2017 rejection by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  And while the SEC has since moved to review that decision – a process that is still pending – markets at the time reacted poorly, perhaps because some were betting that the U.S. regulator would approve rather than shoot down the proposed ETF.  On the news, the market dropped by nearly 30% that day, ultimately recovering above the $1,000 level after the initial drop.  But in what was perhaps a harbinger of the months to come, bitcoin's price was back above its pre-ETF point within days of the ruling. And despite the reluctance expressed by the SEC at the time, a number of firms have filed to create bitcoin ETFs, with a particular focus on funds tied to cryptocurrency futures.  The summer of bulls  If there was one phrase to define the period between May and September of this year, it was this: a new all-time high for bitcoin.  The cryptocurrency's price pushed past each successive milestone with apparent ease, including one on May 1 that saw bitcoin break past a record set on an infamous and now-defunct exchange.  This summer also saw significant activity around initial coin offerings, as shown by data in CoinDesk's ICO Tracker, leading one observer to dub it ""the summer of crypto love.""  As May drew to a close, the price of bitcoin climbed above $2,000 for the first time and surpassed $3,000 just weeks later. At the same time, those price milestones were often accompanied by subsequent turbulence, including a drop of $300 within one hour just a day after the $3,000 line was first crossed.  Perhaps one of the most noteworthy developments was the entry of major Wall Street analysts to the bitcoin price-watching game. Goldman Sach's Sheba Jafari notably predicted the move past $4,000, leading to further forecasts from both Goldman Sachs and other analysts as the weeks and months progressed.  By the first week of September, the price of bitcoin exceeded $5,000 for the first time – only to drop by hundreds of dollars two days later. Indeed, the coming days would see a reversal of the late summer's gains, with the cryptocurrency's price falling below $3,400 on Sep. 14 and down past $3,000 the following day.  Past $10,000 and beyond  By mid-October, the September malaise had been forgotten and the price of bitcoin was once again above $5,000.  Despite the pending closure of China's ""Big Three"" exchanges and a global crackdown on unregulated ICOs beginning to take shape, the price of bitcoin was largely buoyed by a bullish sentiment which would set the stage for some of the eye-popping moves in store for November and December.  Yet for all the regulatory rumblings and forks away from the bitcoin network, the cryptocurrency's price largely continued its upward trajectory, culminating with the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index's all-time high of $19,783.21 on Dec. 17.  But in a refrain of the moves seen after many of the all-time highs this year, that close encounter with $20,000 was followed just days later by a 30% drop that shaved billions of dollars off of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. It was one of the biggest market corrections seen to date, sending bitcoin's price tumbling below $11,000.  Over the coming days, the price of bitcoin would recover, climbing back beyond $16,000 and higher on other cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide. Yet as shown in the most recent graphs and price data, bitcoin's value has begun falling, dropping to the mid-$13k's on Dec. 28 after opening the day above $15,000.  Indeed, the moves of the past few months raise the same old question: where does bitcoin's price go from here? If 2017 is any indication, all bets are truly off.

42380190,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MN09,1514527235,Bitcoin or Blockchain? Bet That Both Will Thrive in 2018,"Caitlin Long is the chairman and president of Symbiont, an enterprise blockchain platform.  The following article, an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review, outlines Long's personal views and is not intended to provide investment advice.      Bitcoin and blockchain are often pitted against each other, but I come from both worlds and believe that both are game-changers in their own right.  I first learned about bitcoin in 2012 through liberty-oriented channels, which I’d discovered during a search for answers about the financial crisis in 2008. But I also took a deep dive into enterprise blockchain in 2014 while at Morgan Stanley, as a side interest to my day job of running its pension solutions business. In August 2016, I joined Symbiont full-time.  When I look ahead, I see 2018 as a year of maturity for both the bitcoin and enterprise blockchain parts of the space. Bitcoin will yet again prove its anti-fragility, more corporates will embrace it for payments, and the community will successfully resist its financialization. Enterprise blockchain will gain wider acceptance in production applications.  Bitcoin goes corporate  Bitcoin will increasingly be used for B2B foreign-exchange payments by multinational companies in 2018, as bid-offer spreads continue to tighten, daily liquidity consistently exceeds $5 billion and corporate new entrants gain comfort with liquidity providers (which enable corporates to use bitcoin for “cross-currency” transactions without touching the bitcoin itself--in other words, as an intermediary currency for foreign exchange in illiquid currencies).  Corporate bitcoin use will remain predominantly for payments in markets where banking systems are not well-developed. A tell-tale sign that corporate demand is sustainable would be this: when foreign exchange (FX) trading desks start making markets in bitcoin non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).  When that starts – possibly within the next 2 years – Jamie Dimon will admit his mistake and encourage corporate clients to route payments through JPMorgan’s foreign exchange desk, which will become one of the most active market-makers for cross-currency FX involving bitcoin.  Cryptocurrencies will continue to attract users as more folks learn about distortions in mainstream financial markets that just don’t make sense, such as this: household net worth in the U.S. was $96.9 trillion, up $7.2 trillion in the year ending September 30, 2017 (according to the Fed’s latestZ.1 report).  This means the U.S. economy supposedly generated wealth at a rate equal to roughly 40% of its annual income (GDP), despite Americans consuming virtually all of their income and saving very little. Wow, that’s a miracle!  Remember this: all prices are fractions. Prices can go up either because numerators go up or because denominators go down (such as when central banks dilute fiat currencies). So...are financial markets climbing because we're truly getting richer, or because of central bank-induced asset price inflation? Are quantity-constrained cryptocurrencies a safe-haven alternative? Time will tell, but I predict cryptocurrencies will broadly benefit as more folks come to understand what’s driving distortions in financial markets.  One of the ""big 3"" cross-currency central banks will announce in 2018 that it is preparing to issue its currency on a blockchain. The “big 3” are the “super-regional” central banks through which most “cross-currency” foreign exchange transactions settle, including the Fed, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan. The Fed is behind the curve, but in 2018 either the BoE or the BoJ will step forward to allow tokenization of its currency to be executed by institutions in regulatory sandboxes. Corporate treasurers around the world will cheer at the prospect of same-day FX settlement through one (or two) of these “big-3” currencies because it will free up hundreds of billions of capital currently trapped on corporate balance sheets, due to payment system latency.  Yet for all bitcoin’s strengths, I believe advances in the enterprise blockchain will outpace those of bitcoin in 2018.  Let’s face it – enterprises are slower to move than the cryptoasset sector, which moves-fast-and-sometimes-breaks-things.  I believe 2018 will be the year in which a watershed event happens: an enterprise blockchain platform passes a CISO (chief information security officer) audit and is deployed inside the firewall of major financial institutions.  Enterprise goes live  Consensus 2018 will be ""back to the suits."" Let’s face it: attire at industry’s biggest conference has been a pretty good barometer of what's hot in the space. At the inaugural Consensus conference in 2015, bitcoin t-shirts dominated the audience. In 2016, business suits dominated as bankers discovered the space. In 2017, the dominant attire swung back to t-shirts, but this time for ethereum and ICOs. In 2018, I predict it will be ""back to the suits"" as enterprise blockchain accomplishments will again dominate the sector’s headlines, late-followers will scramble to catch up, and corporate treasurers will attend en masse.  The first institutional bond offering will be issued on a blockchain in the U.S. in 2018. Bond markets, not stock markets, will see the first U.S. institutional-level securities issued on a blockchain. Because the regulatory requirement to issue securities in “depository-eligible” (indirect) form does not apply to bond markets, the first institutional securities issued on a blockchain will be bonds – something I’ve predicted for years. In 2018, I believe it will finally happen. Yet, the coming clash between the federal securities laws that govern equities (which contemplate indirect ownership via the DTCC’s Cede & Co.) and state corporate laws (which contemplate that shares are owned directly by shareholders) will not happen yet in 2018.  No new blockchain consortiums will be formed in 2018. If 2017 were the year of forming new consortiums, 2018 will be the year of bilateral projects. Blockchains are networks and therefore suffer from the proverbial chicken and egg problem – consortium first and then project, or project first and then consortium? Consortiums now exist across a wide variety of industries, but – at least for now – more action is happening outside of consortiums than inside them.  Enterprise blockchain adoption will advance beyond incremental-type uses in production, such as sharing of data, to include transformational uses, such as custody of institutional financial assets that only ever exist on a blockchain. This will shine light on quality differences between platforms -- and separate those that are decentralized and offer transformational benefits from those that don’t quite. A big gap will open in 2018 between the ""haves"" and ""have-nots"" in enterprise blockchain.  2018 will be a consolidation year as the sector matures. The sector came of age in 2017, as adoption broadened in both bitcoin and blockchain. In 2018, both will strengthen and deepen further. And property owners the world round will rejoice.

Announced on Dec. 27, U.S.-based exchange service Poloniex revealed it will soon disable all legacy accounts, that is unless these users complete the same verification process as its newer account users who must complete know-your-customer (KYC) due diligence. The exchange said a deadline for identification verification will be released within the first quarter of 2018.  Stepping back, the requirement is perhaps the latest move by the exchange to meet regulatory compliance and better ensure its services aren't used as a conduct for criminal activities such as money laundering. Those not able to meet the requirement deadline, Poloniex said, will have their accounts disabled, meaning they will no longer be able to deposit, trade, lend or open orders.  Similarly, a margin position will be offered an eight-week grace period before closure.  It appears that the only feature to remain functional for legacy users will be withdrawal, which is subject to a maximum limit of $2,000.

42380197,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MN8x,1514505619,"Hacks, Scams and Attacks: Blockchain's 2017 Disasters","Hard forks? Soft forks? ICOs?  Bombarded by no shortage of unfamiliar technical terms in 2017, consumers in the blockchain sector once again proved a ripe target for hackers and criminals. But, not all hacks and scams were created equal. Some rose above the froth – either due to their size or impact – as well as what they said about the state of blockchain technology and the industry itself.  Still, the impacts of these incidents were far from academic. Whether it was a simple wallet hack, fraudulent ICO or a bug in a piece of software code, investors lost millions, with nearly $490 million taken in the incidents below.  So far, none of the perpetrators of these crimes has been caught or even identified, and it's questionable whether most of these funds can be found or returned.  1. CoinDash ICO Hack  Payment and shipment startup CoinDash launched an initial coin offering (ICO) campaign early this summer, but it quickly had to pump the brakes after its ethereum address was compromised.  The startup raised $7.3 million before a hacker changed the address, causing donations to go to an unknown party. The company shut down the ICO, but promised to send its native token award, CDT, to those who attempted to donate.  While the company stated that donations sent after it had released its statement would not be honored, some investors continued to show support by donating to the hacked address, inadvertently raising the amount of stolen funds from $7 million to $10 million at the time.  All in all, the incident showcases the growing pains experienced by ICOs, which despite raising massive amounts of funds, still had to navigate the complexities of an early-stage technology.  2. Parity Wallet Breach  It was a tough year for cryptocurrency wallet provider Parity, which has the rare distinction of being cited twice on our year-end list.  Issues began in July when the U.K.-based startup discovered a vulnerability in version 1.5 of its wallet software, resulting in at least 150,000 ethers being stolen from user accounts.  The bug was found in its multi-signature wallets, compromising several companies’ ICO fundraisers. At the time, the ethers were worth roughly $30 million, but they're worth closer to $105 million as of mid-December.  The issue was deemed ""critical,"" with the company's CTO, Gavin Wood, announcing at least three compromised addresses and saying efforts were being made to prevent further loss of funds.  It was later found that more than 70,000 ethers were already cashed out or otherwise redeemed in some way, ensuring that their loss was permanent.  3. Enigma Project Scam  Back in ICO-land, issues weren't limited to compromised addresses.  Blockchain startup Enigma saw its website, mailing lists and an administrator account on its Slack channel compromised when fraudsters launched a fake token pre-sale in August, defrauding potential investors of more than 1,500 ethers.  The hijacked accounts promised a large return on investment, and masquerading as the genuine operators of the project, those behind the effort were able to convince unsuspecting consumers to donate to the compromised website.  While the team behind Enigma was able to recover control of the company’s accounts, the ether wallet used by the hacker was emptied, and the funds were not recovered.  4. Parity Wallet Freeze  Perhaps the year's biggest security incident, this entry on the list is also distinguished by being one the few to take place without the apparent aid of a malicious party.  Occurring suddenly this November, a Parity user accidentally found a bug in the software code, freezing more than $275 million in ether in the wallet’s second major incident of 2017.  One of two widely used clients for ethereum, the miscue effectively called into question what was and is a central infrastructure component of the network, prompting some to doubt the company's offerings and renewing criticisms of ethereum itself.  In subsequent updates, developers have pushed to restore the funds, though it's now believed that doing so would require all ethereum users to upgrade their software.  5. Tether Token Hack  In another incident notable for its unresolved controversies, more than $30 million was stolen from the U.S. dollar-pegged cryptocurrency Tether in late November.  At the time, Tether claimed that roughly $31 million’ worth of tokens were taken from their virtual treasury and sent to an unknown bitcoin address.  Not a significant number in the cryptocurrency economy, the hack was more relevant as it effectively renewed long-standing criticisms of Tether the company, prompting scrutiny in the form of blog posts and mainstream news exposes.  The company later moved to blacklist the tokens stolen through an update to the Omni protocol, the blockchain on which it is based. Still, Tether continues to be dogged by allegations the incident played no small part in stirring up.  6. Bitcoin Gold Scam  Think forks were confusing? So did scammers, and those seeking to cash out new tokens awarded in blockchain splits often proved all too easy to target.  Shortly after the launch of a bitcoin fork called bitcoin gold, for example, some bitcoin users had their cryptocurrency wallets drained after using a service seemingly endorsed by the project's development team.  Marketed as a way to authenticate whether a user was eligible for bitcoin gold funds (effectively free money for bitcoin owners), the website’s operators instead stole more than $3 million in bitcoin, bitcoin gold, ethereum and litecoin.  Bitcoin gold’s development team claimed no formal relationship with the website’s developer, arguing he reached out offering to build a wallet checking service and offering to make his code open-source. The site’s developer initially claimed the site was hacked, but later wiped his GitHub and ceased responding to users on the fork’s Slack channel.  Overall, though, it was another case of consumers falling into traps over promises of free funds.  7. NiceHash Market Breach  That's not to say that long-standing companies were spared by the year's attacks.  This was the case when cryptocurrency mining marketplace NiceHash, a well-known marketplace for mining power, reported being hacked early in December, later confirming that about 4,700 in bitcoin was stolen. At the time, that was worth approximately $78 million.  It was later revealed an employee’s computer was compromised, allowing the perpetrator to gain access to the marketplace’s systems and remove bitcoin from the company’s accounts.  NiceHash CEO Marko Kobal later announced that his team was trying to determine how the hack occurred, but that it would take time to establish what happened.
