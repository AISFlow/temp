42375629,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw9Nmx,1594251665,Circle Confirms Freezing $100K in USDC at Law Enforcement's Request,"The CENTRE Consortium blacklisted a USDC address in response to a law enforcement request, freezing $100,000 worth of the stablecoin, a spokesperson said Wednesday.  CENTRE, which issues the dollar-pegged USDC on top of the Ethereum blockchain, confirmed the move, though Circle spokesperson Josh Hawkins, speaking on behalf of the joint Circle-Coinbase operation, said he could not provide any specifics about the blacklisting, which appears to have occurred in mid-June.  “Centre can confirm it blacklisted an address in response to a request from law enforcement. While we cannot comment on the specifics of law enforcement requests, Centre complies with binding court orders that have appropriate jurisdiction over the organization,” the company's statement said in its entirety.  A transaction on Etherscan indicates that CENTRE called a ""blacklist(address investor)"" function on an address, essentially freezing all coins on it. It was not immediately clear who owned the address.  “When an address is blacklisted, it can no longer receive USDC and all of the USDC controlled by that address is blocked and cannot be transferred on-chain,” according to a policy document shared with CoinDesk.  The incident underscores the limits of decentralization when regulated businesses interact with permissionless networks. While USDC runs on a public blockchain, where normally funds are under user control, in order to remain compliant CENTRE wields the power to sanction certain accounts.  Read more: Ledn Launches USDC Stablecoin Savings Accounts With Focus on Latin America  Only the consortium itself can blacklist addresses, not any individual USDC issuer, the document said.  This appears to be the first time an address was blacklisted, as noted in an earlier report by The Block.  Checks and balances  CENTRE retains the right to blacklist addresses under two circumstances. The first occurs if there is a potential security breach or other threat to the network, the policy statement said.  According to the document, CENTRE will also consider a blacklist “to comply with a law, regulation or legal order from a duly recognized U.S. authorized authority, U.S. court of competent jurisdiction or other governmental authority with jurisdiction over CENTRE.”  In both cases, a majority of CENTRE’s Board of Managers – which includes Circle co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire, Coinbase Chief Financial Officer Alesia Haas and Impossible Foods Chief Legal Officer Dana Wagner – must vote to approve any blacklisting, and they might object to such a request if there are commingled funds on a platform or if blacklisting the address will otherwise pose a risk to the network, the document said.  The group can also reverse any such decisions.  USDC issuers must alert users of the potential for blacklisting by including a statement in their user agreements, the document said.  ""To ensure effective Centre oversight of this Policy, Centre will regularly report publicly, the most up-to-date list of blacklisted addresses, amount of USDC tokens frozen, and corresponding fiat reserves that have been segregated. In addition, this information will be verified and publicly reported by monthly attestation of Centre’s outside accounting firm,"" the document said.",NEUTRAL,USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | USDC,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/08/circle-confirms-freezing-100k-in-usdc-at-law-enforcements-request,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5933b8b98d0721cfd9ddfdc8bdcf5dd48f8c0948-1200x968.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432250,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNBGTh,1594242798,Kyber Network Is Bringing Yield Farming to DEXland,"Fresh pastures are opening in the world of yield farming.      Kyber, a decentralized exchange (DEX), is preparing to share trading fees with KNC token holders. Launched Tuesday, KyberDAO will let users stake KNC and earn yields in more KNC, proportional to their stake.      Yields won't actually kick in for about two more weeks, but participants will need to participate in voting in the week prior in order to start accruing earnings.      A growing trend in decentralized finance (DeFi) has been for users with significant holdings to earn returns by contributing those assets to DeFi applications that need liquidity. Launched in 2017, Kyber has always been designed as a DEX that connects liquidity with users, without middlemen.      Read more: What Is Yield Farming? The Rocket Fuel of DeFi, Explained      A fee of 0.20% on each trade made on Kyber will be paid out to various parties. Of that, 65% will go to those who have staked on the DAO, 30% will go to entities providing liquidity on-chain for Kyber and 5% will be used to buy KNC and burn it, gradually increasing the value of KNC.      Kyber's daily trading volume over the last month has been as high as $9 million and as low as over $2.4 million. DeFi Pulse lists it as the fifth-largest DEX in terms of total value locked (TVL), with $6.6 million. It's worth noting Kyber is not limited to liquidity directly on-chain, but also makes it easy for other liquidity providers to access Kyber's orders.    Yield farming a DEX?    With KyberDAO, the company is giving an incentive for more users to hold onto their KNC and actively participate in governance. As in most such setups, users can do this easily by delegating their stake to another entity that will cast votes for them.      KyberDAO is part of a broader upgrade on the DEX called Katalyst.      There has been a general uptick of interest in DEXs thanks to the broader surge in DeFi. More broadly, there's just a lot of activity on Ethereum right now.      Read more: DeFi’s ‘Agricultural Revolution’ Has Ethereum Users Turning to Decentralized Exchanges      For now, Kyber provides a way for DeFi apps and people to make trades straight from their wallets, but the vision is bigger than enabling users to play the market. Kyber anticipates a bright future for payments in various crypto tokens. By providing incentives to get enough liquidity on-chain, one day vendors could accept any token for any payment.      ParaFi Capital recently announced an investment in Kyber. As ParaFi's Ben Forman told CoinDesk in an email:    “Kyber is growing rapidly across a variety of KPIs [key performance indicators] – monthly trades, monthly unique traders, number of integrations, and monthly trading volumes. The team is executing flawlessly and is well-positioned to capitalize on the growth of the broader DeFi ecosystem.”",POSITIVE,KNC,ETH | EXCHANGE | KNC | MARKET | TRADING,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/07/08/kyber-network-is-bringing-yield-farming-to-dexland,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/89a17d79ad466ac59f17d11e278482c07e348277-1920x1440.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $9,444 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), gaining 2% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $9,202-$9,474.  BTC above 10-day and 50-day moving average, a bullish signal for market technicians, trading volumes on Wednesday are higher than Tuesday.    “Bitcoin became oversold from a short-term perspective last week for the first time since mid-March,” said Katie Stockton, an analyst at Fairlead Strategies. “This seems to be giving way to an uptick in short-term momentum, which has been weak since late May,” she added.      The jump past $9,400 Wednesday came during a time of lower spot trading activity. Volumes have dipped since May on spot exchanges like Coinbase after a month of excitement due to bitcoin’s halving, its drop in programmed new supply. The average daily volume over the past three months on Coinbase, for example, is $133 million. In July so far, the daily average has been just $68 million, a 48% drop.      Lower volumes are affecting the over-the-counter market for larger trades as well, said Henrik Kugelberg, a Sweden-based block trader who focuses primarily on bitcoin. “It’s been a very stagnant market for a while now, both for me and my sources,” he said.

Rager, a trader and adviser for crypto brokerage app LVL, wants to see a price jump higher before changing his sentiment. “Until we close above $9,700, I'm not going to be overly bullish in the short term,” he told CoinDesk.      Still, it’s important to put bitcoin’s weak volume and potential price uncertainty in perspective, as it has appreciated 30% in 2020, noted Karl Samsen, director of strategy for crypto merchant services firm Global Digital Assets. “I think we’ve seen glimmers of BTC’s macro use case as a hedge but we’re still waiting for the big moment,” he said.      Read More: Nearly $60M in Bitcoin Moved to Ethereum in June    Balancer making moves    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was up Wednesday, trading around $248 and climbing 4% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Singapore-based quantitative trading firm QCP Capital, in a note to investors Wednesday, said the crypto market’s “alt-season [is] heating up and the DeFi train [is] rolling on.” In 2019, total decentralized exchange, or DEX, volume was $1 billion. DEXs are already over $5 billion so far in 2020, according to data from aggregator Dune Analytics. The leading DEXs are Uniswap, Curve and Balancer, with total DEX volume at $58 million over the most recent 24 hours.      Total value locked in Balancer is now at $159 million according to DeFi Pulse, making it the highest ranked for a DEX. Balancer’s system locks the crypto value in a smart contract as liquidity for traders to swap Ethereum-based tokens on the platform. It balances the types of tokens based on trader demand, hence the name Balancer.      The value locked generates a return based on Balancer’s DEX trading fees, and keeps growing despite a $500,000 exploit hack that occurred on the platform in June. “Balancer has really shot off, even with the hack,” said Andrew Tu of Efficient Frontier, a crypto quantitative trading firm.

42432245,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNBGNh,1594232196,Brazil's Ailing Economy Is Helping Dollar-Pegged Stablecoins Find Traction,"Brazil may be getting its first token boom in 2020, three years after the trend swept Silicon Valley, powered by a growing interest in stablecoins.      According to Binance’s representative in Brazil, Mayra Siqueira, the number of “Brazilian stablecoins traders” quadrupled since January 2020. The exchange’s two most popular stablecoins among Brazilians were Binance’s BUSD and tether (USDT), Siqueira said.      Plus, Nash exchange co-founder Fabio Canesin said his decentralized exchange (DEX) saw roughly $12 million in USDT volume on Ethereum in the past 30 days. He estimated roughly 8,000 of the DEX's users are Brazilian.      Rather than spawning a Bitcoin Utopia, so far the cryptocurrency trend has further aligned Brazil with the U.S. dollar.      “We have a trend of dollarization,” Canesin said of his homeland Brazil, ""so of course having stablecoin access is interesting for … access to smart contracts for more stable savings.”      Read more: Bitcoin in Emerging Markets: Latin America      He said such crypto fans are looking for value outside the ailing Brazilian currency system because the Brazilian real hit a record low against the dollar in May 2020.      “From the user’s perspective there’s very little reason to have a real-pegged stablecoin,” he said.      However, Thomaz Teixeira, co-founder of the Brazilian crypto startup nTokens, disagreed with Canesin’s view. Teixeira’s company is working closely with the Stellar Foundation, he said, to spread and support “virtual real” stablecoins. This startup is one of many stablecoin projects soon to launch in Brazil.      Brazilian blockchain veteran and Celo advocate Fernando Bresslau said there are now at least five local stablecoin projects in Brazil, not to mention the Brazilian real stablecoin proposal submitted to the Celo community in June.      “We’re serious about making something with Celo that makes sense for the local market,” Bresslau said.    Local options    John Willock, co-founder of the Brazilian exchange Bolsa Cripto, also helped develop a real-pegged stablecoin using an ERC-20 token, and aims to launch it this year.      His exchange already supports access to the dollar-pegged stablecoin PAX, although overall traction is modest.      “We’re looking at all other [stablecoin] options … whether it’s something like dai or USDC,” Willock said. “Stablecoins, more than anything else, are all about the distribution strategy. … We’ve been looking to other issuers of stablecoins to see how they would like to make these assets more available.”      Read more: Ledn Launches USDC Stablecoin Savings Accounts With Focus on Latin America      Willock said there could be demand for both dollar-pegged assets and local digital assets, adding that eventually the market will decide which stablecoins are used for various purposes. There may be a growing interest in dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies thanks in part to strict capital controls, but both Bresslau and Teixeira agreed local commerce will still be denominated in Brazilian currency for the foreseeable future.      “Even though we have a deep trauma with hyperinflation in Brazil, especially in the 1980s and 1990s, it’s not a part of our culture to have the economy in dollar terms. Unlike Argentina,” Teixeira said. “In Argentina, restaurants would rather get dollars than pesos. Here in Brazil, that’s not the case.”      He said local restaurants and small businesses are now operating on such tight margins that conversion fees, or volatile assets like bitcoin, are more expensive in the short-term than sticking to Brazilian reals. That’s why Brazilian banking experiments continue quietly, using real-pegged stablecoins.      “If your asset oscillates more than their profit margin in a week or month, that’s not ideal,” Teixeira said of decentralized cryptocurrencies. “If they’re getting payments in dollars and paying expenses in reals, I don’t think most Brazilians are ready to do that.”",NEUTRAL,USDT,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | USDT | BNB,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/07/08/brazils-ailing-economy-is-helping-dollar-pegged-stablecoins-find-traction,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/63215e2a2da1a2931523814929c566408d50aa80-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432254,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNBGbh,1594230558,Electroneum Mines Multi-Country Charity Donations During COVID-19,"When Gyam Queen heard Nigeria would enter a 14-day lockdown, her first thought was about her studies. Queen, who is 26, is pursuing a Hospitality Management course at Wavecrest College in Lagos and aspires to open a restaurant offering Nigerian cuisine.      Thanks to a donation from the WONDER Foundation, a crypto-backed U.K. NGO, hundreds of girls like Queen can now see their dreams become a reality.      ''I have got a smartphone and internet access, and now I can do online studies and surf the internet without spending a single penny,'' said Queen speaking from Lagos, which is still under lockdown.      Cryptocurrencies are gaining momentum as a way to donate funds to non-profits. The number of charities accepting crypto donations has doubled in North America, Europe and Australia, according to the 2019 Global NGO Technology Report. Groups like the Giving Block, which worked on a CoinDesk charity campaign recently, help non-profits navigate crypto technology.      U.K. startup Electroneum, which runs a 140-country mobile payments network, has built charity directly into its business model. Since 2019, the network, which mines the ETN coin, has donated a portion of its block rewards to help fund 12 separate educational and community-building efforts.    I still do not fully understand how the price of a cryptocurrency fluctuates, but I am happy to get nearly $35,000.    Electronium signs up nongovernmental organizations as network validators, which then receive a block reward in the same way bitcoin miners receive satoshis for helping to secure the network. Electroneum’s target audiences are the economically weaker regions of the world, where the financial possibilities of cryptocurrency are most in need, said Richard Ells, the CEO and founder of Electroneum.      ''The NGOs are mostly working with the unbanked population, and that is our target audience. Cryptocurrencies don't have trust in many parts of the world, so if we help these NGOs, we reach out to the people and make them aware and they gain a little bit of extra income,'' said Ells.      This sounds like a win-win-win situation: Electroneum gains users, charities receive funding and those who need it the most become part of a financial system. But it’s not easy to convince NGOs to become part of a novel economic experiment.      ''No, the first thing that came to my mind was scam, fraud and skepticism,'' says Carmen Gonzalez, the CEO of the WONDER Foundation. Initially, the WONDER Foundation was reluctant about mining block rewards as nobody on staff knew how cryptocurrency works.      It is a normal reaction when the director of an NGO raises eyebrows on our proposal, Ells said. ''It's too good to be true for them,'' he said. The first step is to make them understand this is not a scam, the second step is to explain block rewards and mining, and the third is they are not losing anything, he said.      After months of conversation between WONDER and Electroneum, in July 2019 the foundation began validating the Electroneum network in exchange for ETN block rewards.      ''I still do not fully understand how the price of a cryptocurrency fluctuates and who decides it, but I am happy to get nearly $35,000, which I would have never received from traditional donation methods,'' said Gonzalez. Her foundation is also using Electroneum to help an Indian NGO called Kamalini, where she sent nearly $18000.      In addition to supporting NGOs, Electroneum is working on providing internet access to African and Asian countries. Electroneum wants ETN to provide electricity to four countries – Nigeria, Senegal, Mali and Gambia – and give the users Electricity top-up from the app, he says.      Students like Queens from Wavecrest College of Hospitality talk about the lack of electricity as a major hurdle in their studies. She checks the battery sign on her phone regularly and makes sure to charge up before any scheduled power cuts. ''Smartphones are not enough, we need infrastructure,'' she said.      Rosana Forsuelo, the provost of Wavecrest College of Hospitality, hopes for more help from the WONDER Foundation and Electroneum.      She doesn't understand much about block rewards and says, ''Cryptocurrency is like bitcoin.'' But she knows crypto is money.      ''We got nearly $17,000, which we spent on food items, staff salary, laptops and smartphones. One of our security guards, Mr. Pius, got an emergency funding of $160 as he was thrown out from his house in the COVID-19 crisis. The funding from WONDER Foundation and Electroneum helped us a lot,'' she said.      ''But we need more funding as our staff needs to be paid. The lack of infrastructure is making the situation worse in the pandemic,'' she said.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING | TRADING,Vinamrata Chaturvedi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/08/electroneum-mines-multi-country-charity-donations-during-covid-19,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/22e51cf32ec144049a912733639497a460f4ed5d-2000x1409.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Randall Joseph Smail, 23, admitted in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia that he used a phony account statement from the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange to defraud the Pendleton Community Bank of a $552,533 loan, according to plea documents.  Smail told the bank he could only withdraw his $640,000 bitcoin in $200,000 increments “due to tax issues,” according to Jan. 27 court filings. Both statements were false, as Smail did not have any bitcoin with Kraken.  Smail ultimately received $1,800 of the bank loan. He could face a maximum of 30 years in prison and a $1,000,000 fine for committing bank fraud.  There were discrepancies in the amount of bitcoin the government said Smail lied about having. The Department of Justice’s Tuesday press release and the case’s first court filings gave a value of $640,000,000. However, Smail’s lawyer, Stanton Levenson, said the real figure was $640,000. The U.S Attorney’s Office did not respond to a CoinDesk request for comment.  ""Very few in the traditional banking system comprehend cryptocurrency,"" a Kraken spokesperson told CoinDesk.

42432248,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNBGPh,1594227154,Start9 Labs Pitches a Private At-Home Server. And It Works,"A Colorado company is betting it can make the decentralized web more accessible with a no-frills server you can install in your own home.      Start9 Labs’ Embassy server, housed in a Raspberry Pi, sets up its own private internet network and comes with its own operating system as well as an expanding range of services such as bitcoin transactions, messaging and password management that cut out middlemen and use the Tor network to communicate.      People use the Tor network because it makes it incredibly difficult to trace internet activity to a user, encrypting it multiple times and hiding a user's location. But Tor can be hard to navigate for those who aren’t tech savvy. That’s why Start9 Labs is betting on Embassy’s no-frills operating system, Ambassador – which handles server setup, owner authentication, networking and the installation, configuration and serving of decentralized apps – to make the decentralized web more accessible and popular.      See also: Cryptography Startup Brings Private Payment Channels to Tezos Blockchain      “[It’s] net-connected hardware that will all be networked together on a private internet, rather than each of those devices feeding all your private data to whatever cloud provider sold you that device,"" said Matt Hill, co-founder of Start9 Labs.      Start9 Labs is not building on Web 2.0, but rather hijacking that infrastructure so people can run their own private networks. To build a new internet from the ground up requires a physical hardware device in every single home, said Hill. The Embassy server is a first step in that direction.      If this seems abstract and esoteric, consider the recent security law China has imposed on Hong Kong, essentially criminalizing some forms of thought, expression and speech, in response to pro-democracy protests that raged there last year. Google, Twitter and Facebook stopped reviewing requests for user data from Hong Kong by law enforcement while evaluating the law. But these companies still control reams of user data, much of it intimately linked to users’ thoughts and speech. The Embassy server and the services built into it by design don’t allow such companies access to data.    We are building this company and this product in such a way that it actually can't be censored.    “We are building this company and this product in such a way that it actually can't be censored, can't be subpoenaed for anything,” said Hill. “It's important to us that if somebody says, ‘Stop doing what you're doing,' our response is, ‘Honestly, we can't.’”      Hill and co-founder Keagan McClelland recently appeared on a Coin Center podcast with Peter Van Valkenburgh to discuss the need for privacy tech. They noted that troublesome centralization comes in many forms, be it Gmail or exchanges like Coinbase, which serves as the intermediary for millions of cryptocurrency transactions. They want to change that.      Hill pitches his kit as an easy, out-of-the-box solution for accessing your private network. So I tried it out with one of the Embassy servers. Privacy-focused tech is often more difficult than conventional tech to understand and use. You’re replacing streamlined user interfaces on apps like Facebook with something more minimalist that doesn’t abuse your data. But I was able to set up the Embassy following the four simple steps it laid out, and access the Start9 Embassy app in Apple’s App store.      Soon after, I was using the Cups messenger service, which looks like a standalone app on my homescreen, to ping Hill a message from my unique Tor address to his, authenticated with our private keys through the Ambassador OS.      See also: Trezor shield turns Raspberry Pi's into bitcoin wallets      Cups doesn’t currently have push notifications, and there is a bit of a lag. But it functions just fine, was easy to operate and there is no middleman to snoop on our messages. It was just me and Hill, communicating through our own private servers.      The Embassy server currently costs $200, but Start9 Labs is going to be releasing the specs online, so anyone can build it. The software is all open source, and people can build apps to add to it. The goal, said Hill, is to create tech that could live on even after the company may be gone.      “If we go away, our spirit continues, there is no killing we're doing,” said Hill. “We are a company, so it can be forcibly closed. But the technology that has been developed lives on as though nothing happened. It's open source software running on commodity hardware.

Speaking at the Global Digital Finance virtual summit Wednesday, Libra Director of Policy Julien Le Goc said the Facebook-backed entity was still looking at its original plan: ""We’ve not abandoned the multi-currency stablecoin, drawing its DNA from the [International Monetary Fund's] special drawing fund, which remains an important design feature.""  Libra's original vision in 2019 had been to release one multi-currency stablecoin backed by a basket of up to 30 fiat currencies.  This was hit with resistance from government officials who were concerned about a private entity challenging their monetary sovereignty.  In an updated white paper earlier this year, Libra appeared to scale back its ambitions and said it would first create a series of single-currency stablecoins instead.  A multi-currency asset was still on the cards, the white paper read, but it would be backed by single-asset stablecoins, with the weighting reviewed and changed over time.  Le Goc confirmed Libra still wants to become a borderless payment method for the world's unbanked.  He said the Swiss-based association was also creating a new regulatory compliance framework in an ""ongoing dialogue"" with central bankers.  He added that Libra was also exploring ways it could make its governance structure closer to a public-private partnership with national governments.

42432253,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNBGZh,1594224868,What DeFi Can Learn From 'InFi',"Leah Callon-Butler, a CoinDesk columnist, is the director of Emfarsis, a consulting firm focused on the role of technology in advancing economic development in Asia.      There are 1.7 billion unbanked people around the world, and if you had the chance to ask each and every one of them what they ultimately desired, I doubt any of them would say: A bank account. Still, in traditional circles, a bank’s greenlight to transact is seen as the Holy Grail of financial inclusion.      In lieu of this, the developing world has produced a wealth of community-based systems that rely on shared values to achieve economic empowerment on their own terms. By studying these informal systems of cooperation, we may uncover opportunities for blockchain to improve on existing practices or help to scale positive impact. This approach to product development can create more inclusive solutions and a better path to user adoption.      Let’s take the Philippines’ paluwagan as a use case.      See also: Leah Callon-Butler - To See Libra’s Potential, Look at the Philippines, Not the US      In its simplest form: A paluwagan is a group of people who decide to pool their money for the purpose of saving. They verbally agree on some basic terms such as how much everyone will contribute and how often, say, 1,000 pesos from each group member each payday. Then they take turns to collect the pot of cash.      So, in this example, a paluwagan of eight people who get paid fortnightly would run for 16 weeks, and each time they make their deposits, one person gets to withdraw the total kitty of 8000 pesos. The more people in the group, the bigger the payout.      Since no custodian is required, this version of a paluwagan is deemed transparent and efficient to run, with no requirement for record keeping. It’s also easy to join, as membership is based purely on social capital. The only qualifying criteria is for participants to trust each other, so the practice is popular with co-workers, neighbours and other friendly groups.      The element of shared accountability persuades people to make their contributions on time and provides motivation and discipline to save, along with the idea that group performance yields higher results.    Appreciating the implicit social value within existing informal systems presents opportunities for technologists to address some of the world’s most persistent challenges.    It’s also more fun. While the main goal of a paluwagan is to achieve the group’s financial targets, it is also an opportunity to socialize and network, deepening relationships and establishing a sense of community.      “I tried saving money to my bank account, but as a single guy without much responsibility at that time, it was hard,” Gerard, a young Filipino professional who joined a paluwagan with colleagues at work and saved 20,000 pesos to buy a laptop, told me recently.      “Being in a paluwagan is a good way to save money because you have a sense of responsibility to pay it every payday and you make sure you budget for it,” he said.      Other members of the paluwagan who were married with kids put the money toward special occasions, like birthdays or family holidays, or to pay school fees.      Sometimes, those with a specific date in mind would volunteer to receive their payout last. But this is risky because there may be delinquent contributors along the way, who collect the bounty early and fail to settle their ongoing obligations, which reduces the value of the pot down the line.      “It’s easy to spot a fraudster at the outset, if they insist on being one of the first to get paid out,” said Gerard, who has seen some paluwagan members disappear off the face of the earth straight after they get their payout. “Even your most trusted friend will do it, especially in companies where people easily come and go, like call centers.”      The paluwagan system is unregistered and unregulated, with no guarantee that individuals will receive their scheduled payout. There is no formal grievance mechanism either, which makes it impossible to make a legal claim against dropouts and scammers.      Further, the Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission has issued warnings about paluwagan scams that proliferate via social media promising huge returns on investment.      Even so, their appeal remains strong. And not just in the Philippines. In Malaysia, they are called Kutu Funds. In slum communities across Bolivia, Peru and Argentina they could be called Vaquita, Reuda or Pasanaku. Commonly known as a Rotating Credit and Savings Association (ROSCA), these informal financial institutions are found all over the world. ROSCAs are difficult to standardize as their nature and purpose depends on their members, their goals, their histories and their culture.      A variation on the ROSCA is the Accumulated Savings and Credit Association (ASCA). Instead of rotating payouts, the ASCA uses its pooled funds to make loans or invest in community projects. After, say, a year, the fund is paid back to its original members with interest. The ASCA model may be a more sustainable alternative to the usual microfinance route of providing basic credit, as the latter is known to induce a cycle of indebtedness.      The idea draws parallels with the movement toward Decentralized Finance. DeFi is blockchain-based financial software that mimics traditional banking to provide services such as savings facilities, lending and interest earnings. However, it’s decentralized nature means it is an open, peer-to-peer solution that is controlled by the community rather than a centralized authority.      PoolTogether, a decentralized application (dapp) on the Ethereum blockchain, shares similarities with the paluwagan. Marketed as a no-loss lottery, PoolTogether incentivizes users to pool their cash for a set period. At the end of the term, everyone gets their money back, plus one lucky punter wins the interest earned on the fund during the lockup.      Leveraging smart contracts to automatically execute upon pre-set criteria, DeFi can replace the flimsy trust mechanisms inherent within informal ROSCAs and ASCAs while returning a profit on committed funds. It also negates the requirement for the group to meet in-person, and handle physical cash, which has become a major issue with the advent of COVID-19.      See also: Leah Callon-Butler - Filipino Pawnshops Bank on Crypto Remittances During Crisis      Perhaps most interestingly, one DeFi wallet with a goal to make crypto more user friendly requires no backup seed phrase. Instead, where a user wishes to perform an activity that requires a high degree of security, such as recovering a lost wallet or making a transaction over and above their daily limit, they are allowed to nominate friends or family to support authorization of the request.      This multisignature feature is similar to the triple-locked cash box that is characteristic of the Village Savings and Loan Association (VSLA) model, which is grounded in accountable governance and recognised as a more robust version of a ROSCA or ASCA, and has been successful in supporting millions of poor women from developing countries to become their own bankers and venture capitalists. To unlock the box, the democratically elected VSLA head, deputy head and cashier must all be present, as they each hold a different key to a separate padlock.      Appreciating the implicit social value within existing informal systems presents opportunities for technologists to address some of the world’s most persistent challenges. In particular, DeFi has the potential to bring efficiency and scalability to methods of community collaboration that have been preferred for decades, if not centuries. However, with our poorest communities still unable to secure some of the most basic requirements such as electricity, internet connectivity and smartphone penetration, a paluwagan, or maybe, a triple-locked box, is still the best bet for most.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Leah Callon-Butler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/07/08/what-defi-can-learn-from-infi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a11863c8cc5d843b3aa5b35433a4e0a4ba67a777-1700x1275.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432247,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNBGRh,1594224021,Marlin Releases Open-Source ‘Layer 0’ Transaction Relayer for Ethereum,"Blockchain startup Marlin has released its relay network framework OpenWeaver in an effort to speed up block propagation on the Ethereum network.      Based in San Francisco, U.S. and Bangalore, India, Marlin's open-source “Layer 0” OpenWeaver enables users to find and build blocks quicker on Ethereum than those only leaning on the traditional network’s structure, according to a blog post shared with CoinDesk.      Moreover, OpenWeaver also presents a business use-case for mining services and trading. The relay network alerts users to incoming blockchain transactions quicker than the typical network can by cutting a high-speed path through the chain’s peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture.      As an open-source project, OpenWeaver hopes to strengthen the decentralization of the Ethereum network by providing another rail for crypto transactions to be processed.      Read more: Ethereum Developers Delay Berlin Hard Fork to Stem Client Centralization Concerns      “Ethereum itself has 60% of its nodes concentrated on cloud services,” Marlin CEO Siddhartha Dutta said in a phone interview with CoinDesk. “When most of your nodes are running or situated or located in the same region on the same cloud service, taking them down at once becomes particularly easy.”    Relay networks    Blockchains transfer information like high school gossip: from one person to the next. Everyone hears the scuttlebutt at some point. In the same manner, when a user sends ether (ETH) from their wallet to someone else, they announce the transaction to other computers (nodes) next to theirs, which is then shouted across the network by other nodes.      A downside of this feature is the slow speed with which information carries across crowds and the ability to “corner” certain information as it spreads.      Relay networks operate as a workaround wherein a new transaction is broadcast through a select set of nodes. Think of it like best friends sharing a secret among themselves before the news breaks across the school.      The idea is not totally novel, however. Content Delivery Networks (CDN) went live in the 1990s to slice across the web faster. In crypto, there’s projects like Bitcoin Core developer Matt Corallo’s FIBRE project which replaced the earlier Bitcoin Relay Network.      Read more: New Bitcoin Core Release Gives Boost to Block Relay Network      FIBRE is an open-source attempt at creating multiple Layer 0 solutions for speeding up block propagation. The network has only six nodes across three continents connected by high-speed internet to the Bitcoin blockchain.      The project was later included in Bitcoin Core’s software itself in March 2017 with the release of Bitcoin Core 0.14.0      Since then, mining firms – particularly smaller operations – or trading platforms have been able to connect to FIBRE or make their own relay network to process transactions faster than the regular network, which disseminates transactions slowly from node to node. Relays can also work as an emergency backup in case of political crackdowns on node operators.    Ethereum and more    Every blockchain may need a relay network in a multi-chain future. That’s why Marlin built OpenWeaver as an agnostic system that can be deployed in just a few lines of script, Dutta said.      Venture capital-backed BloXroute is one competitor to Marlin’s OpenWeaver, which also focuses on Ethereum. The network successfully decreased block propagation times by half when tested by independent blockchain analytics company Akomba Labs in November 2019. BloXroute is also an open-source project, but maintains its own token for paying service fees.      One place OpenWeaver could be successful is onboarding consumers into Ethereum, Dutta said.      As a de facto routing network, decentralized applications (dapps) could “subscribe” to a relay network, which would act as a virtual “gas station” for the Ethereum blockchain in what are called “meta transactions.” (In Ethereum you have to purchase the native unit ether to use applications.)      Read more: Ethereum Activity Metric Hits Highest Level in 2 Years      Relayers could provide a way for dapps to cover a user's gas tab on the front end, which would help address the long-standing hindrance of newbies entering the crypto game, he said.      Workarounds like OpenWeaver could also appeal to DeFi products that have to interact with the main Ethereum blockchain. Instead of competing against other users by bidding up gas prices, a Layer 0 solution allows a product to take its own sideroad to settle transactions.      “Traders want low latency connections to miners and mining pools and because of arbitrage and liquidators that exist in DeFi. Relayer networks allow traders to have low-latency mempool syncs….It's like high-frequency trading happening on a per-block basis,” Dutta said.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MINING | FORKS,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/07/08/marlin-releases-open-source-layer-0-transaction-relayer-for-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3a50628e6dce39b4b93862bd9dce2214fa0c988e-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A mere 23% of the 1,150 crypto holders who responded to the Cremation Institute’s online survey, conducted between October 2019 and June 2020, reported having a documented plan for passing on their crypto assets in case of their death. That’s despite the vast majority - 89% - of participants who worry on some level about whether their crypto assets will be passed on to their loved ones.  Unsurprisingly, the lack of planning is strongest among younger generations. Millennials and Gen Zers are 10 times more likely to lack a crypto inheritance plan than their elders, the survey found.

42432242,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNBGHh,1594220415,Hong Kong’s National Security Law Could Threaten Local Crypto Brokerages,"U.S. sanctions in response to Hong Kong’s national security law – and Beijing’s tighter grip over the city’s financial system – could pose challenges for local crypto brokerage firms.      The U.S. Senate passed the Hong Kong Autonomy Act on Thursday to penalize China for eroding Hong Kong’s autonomy. The bill is in response to a new national security law that broadly criminalizes acts of sedition, collusion, terrorism and subversion, which could include publicly criticizing the Chinese Communist Party. The law is already sending a chill over free expression in Hong Kong.      The bill stipulates that the U.S. government should restrict foreign banks and subsidiaries of U.S. banks in Hong Kong from accessing the U.S. dollar system if they conduct significant transactions with persons or entities that contribute to weakening Hong Kong's autonomy.      No specific banks have been targeted and the bill does not provide the criteria that determine whether a bank deserves a sanction. The U.S. Treasury Secretary will decide on what behavior would result in a sanction on a bank, according to the bill.      This could take a toll on cryptocurrency companies in Hong Kong. In particular, it could affect crypto brokerages, which are highly dependent on the U.S. dollar system to settle and clear transactions. Hong Kong is an important crypto hub, especially in Asia. Major mainland China-originated crypto exchanges such as OKCoin and Huobi have offices, and offer crypto trading services, in Hong Kong, given its relatively crypto-friendly regulations.      “The most successful cryptocurrency companies here are dependent on their access to the U.S. dollar system,” said Leo Weese, the president and co-founder of the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong, a non-profit organization. “They move money around, they are big brokers and if they somewhat lose that access they are in trouble.”      Read More: Global Protests Reveal Bitcoin’s Limitations      That access is important to large crypto brokerage companies because fiat currencies transactions between investors and brokerage are settled and cleared by banks in U.S. dollars, Weese said.      “Even though you are in Asia, you still rely a lot on U.S. banking,” said Charles Yang, head trader at Genesis Block, one of the largest over-the-counter (OTC) desks that primarily offers cross-border crypto brokerage services in Hong Kong.      OTC desks are different from cryptocurrency exchanges, through which trades are based on a market price. With OTC desks, brokers help traders find counterparties.      For most Asia-based brokerage companies (OTC desks), if they can not easily transfer money to U.S. counterparties, then it slows down flows and trading volume will be much lower, Yang said.      “If there is any further friction from the U.S. policy, it could be very damaging to our business,” Yang said.    Increasing frictions, limiting banks    Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) started to accept licensing applications from virtual asset trading platforms last November in a bid to offer a clearer regulatory framework for digital asset trading services providers.      Major international investors have also set their sights on Hong Kong-based crypto firms. OSL, one of the largest crypto exchanges that provide trading brokerage and custodian services in Hong Kong, secured a $14 million investment from Fidelity International via an equity shares acquisition. Amber Group, a Hong Kong-based startup that offers a range of financial services such as trading and lending for crypto investors, secured $28 million in a Series A funding round from U.S.-based investors such as Coinbase Ventures and Polychain Capital.      While it is still unclear what exact sanctions the U.S. government will impose on Hong Kong, there are two scenarios that could hurt brokerage companies, Yang said.      Crypto-friendly U.S. banks, such as Silvergate and Signature, provide 24/7 instant crypto settlement services. The U.S. government could limit what amounts and where these banks can send money, which would increase friction for money transfers back to Hong Kong, Yang said.      Read more: China Stocks Surge and NYC Real Estate Craters: 5 Stories Shaping Markets Today      Crypto brokerage companies could also face difficulties in wiring money from Hong Kong to the U.S., Yang said. For example, many such companies use the Bank of Communications, which is one of the largest state-owned commercial banks in mainland China. If that bank is sanctioned by the U.S. government, the companies won't be able to wire their money to their U.S. bank accounts, Yang said.      Another concern is that more scrutiny would prolong transaction times, according to Yang.      “The banks would flag Hong Kong-related transactions more often, they would hold the transactions and do a compliance query, and that could take a few days to resolve, which means there will be a lot of friction,” Yang said.      “If the money transfers between Hong Kong, London and the U.S. are being blocked, or being made more expensive, then the Hong Kong brokers won’t have as much of the need to really be here because [Hong Kong] won’t be able to serve the local market as efficiently,” Weese said.      The bill vaguely refers to officials and foreign persons who “materially contribute to the contraventions of China’s obligation.” After the president signs the bill, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will have 90 days to identify Chinese officials and foreign persons who are involved in anti-democracy activities, such as cracking down on protests, and report them to Congress. The Secretary of the Treasury will then have 60 days to submit a list of foreign institutions that conduct “significant transactions” with these persons, according to the bill.      “If the bill goes into effect, money transfers between banks in Hong Kong will face more surveillance and the risks of being frozen due to the new sanctions,” said Jason Wu, the CEO of Definer, a crypto lending firm with a focus on cross-border transactions between the U.S. and China.      While some crypto investors can use cash or face-to-face trading to trade crypto with fiat currencies, many have to register with brokerage firms in compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) regulations by Hong Kong’s financial authorities, especially the block trades in millions of dollars, Wu said.

Cross-border money transfers between the U.S. and Hong Kong already faced stricter scrutiny even before the bill, according to Wu.      People in Hong Kong have been trying to transfer their money to overseas bank accounts since the unrest started in March 2019. Both the Chinese and U.S. governments are closely watching these financial transactions, Wu said.    The future of Hong Kong’s financial system    The bill is not the only U.S. attempt to dismantle Hong Kong’s financial and economic privileges as Beijing weakens the city’s autonomy. The U.S. government has issued restrictions on visas for Chinese officials and threatened to revoke Hong Kong’s special trade status.      “I think for now there is no intention to mess with Hong Kong’s financial system and scare companies away, but of course things could quickly change,” Weese said of China’s national security law.      “Neither the Chinese nor the U.S. government has disclosed what exact measures they will take to influence Hong Kong’s financial system,” Wu said. “One extreme case is that Hong Kong becomes like any other city in mainland China and wire transfers would be much more difficult.”      “If you make wire transfers in mainland China, there will be many limitations such as going through more scrutiny with financial authorities such as the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), which makes it difficult to make the transfers, Wu said. However, it is much easier in Hong Kong because it is in the international settlement system.      One extreme case is that Hong Kong becomes just like any other city in mainland China in terms of financial freedom, Wu said.

At least that’s how we’ve observed it in other places,” Weese said.      “The very largest brokerages only exist in places where they can efficiently buy and sell a million or 10 million dollars worth of bitcoin,” Weese said.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/07/08/hong-kongs-national-security-law-could-threaten-local-crypto-brokerages,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7f01a821240f3f8a45e724a663354c5a66a4340c-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42387615,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQloZ5,1594220400,Introducing the CoinDesk 20: The Assets That Matter Most in Crypto,"Which cryptocurrencies matter most to the market?  That question gets tougher to answer every day as new digital assets join the thousands already traded. Those looking to figure out which ones are the most important have often used simple metrics such as market capitalization to sort through the Lego pile of coins and tokens. Such simplistic filtering tells only part of the story and is fraught with the potential for manipulation. (Read Anna Baydakova’a recent article for a salient illustration.)  That’s why CoinDesk has launched the CoinDesk 20. This group of 20 digital assets makes up most of what people mean when they say “the cryptocurrency market.” But volume is not the sole criterion for inclusion.  While these 20 cryptocurrencies, tokens and stablecoins together are worth more than 90% of the entirety of the crypto market, the list is not derived simply from valuations. Rather, it involves a smarter way to find the assets most relevant to the market.  A more sophisticated methodology  It starts with the exchanges. But not every exchange – far from it.  On the wild frontier of crypto trading, hundreds of exchanges pop up all the time. Few are trustworthy and reliable. Only a sliver have done what they can to remove manipulation.  CoinDesk’s research team analyzed several studies on the veracity of trading volumes on cryptocurrency exchanges. The team settled on reports from three different outfits – Bitwise, The Block and Digital Asset Research – as the ones deemed to have the soundest research. Of the dozens of venues the reports analyzed, only eight exchanges appeared on all three. Those eight are Bitfinex, Bitflyer, Bitstamp, Coinbase, Gemini, itBit, Kraken and Poloniex.  Notably absent from the list are Huobi, OKEx and Binance, the last perhaps the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. That’s because each of them is absent from at least one of the above lists. To be sure, each of those exchanges offers traders price discovery on some key markets. However, in some of the reports the researchers found sufficient cases of questionable volume on those exchanges to raise some doubt about their reliability. Their exclusion from the CoinDesk 20 may be revisited in the future.  From the group of eight exchanges, CoinDesk added up the volume on every asset traded by quarter, using data provided by Nomics. Any cryptocurrency or digital asset that doesn’t trade on at least two of the eight exchanges didn’t qualify for the CoinDesk 20 because having an asset trade on more than one exchange enables arbitrage opportunities should prices move too far out of whack from one venue to another. That ensures the price and volume data reflect the true market. We then ranked the cryptocurrencies by volume over the last two consecutive quarters. Performing the ranking over two quarters filters out any asset that would have, say, one active month but otherwise show no sustained trading volume. Using the same model, CoinDesk will re-run this analysis every quarter and update the list accordingly.  It should be noted Bitwise no longer includes Bitfinex's prices in how it calculates its index values, a separate operation from its “real volume” calculations. It’s the latter that matters in the methodology for selecting the CoinDesk 20.  Bitwise continues to include Bitfinex in the exchanges contributing to that measure of volume, the data for which continues to be updated and published. Bitwise removed Bitfinex from its index pricing sources in 2019 after the New York Attorney General filed a lawsuit against the exchange. It did so due to concerns about prices deviating in the future should anything happen in the legal case. However, in an email Wednesday, Bitwise’s head of research told CoinDesk, “We still very much believe that Bitfinex has real volume.”  No doubt, over time some newcomers will join this list and existing assets will drop off it. For now, though, these are the results of a clear, objective approach using reliable data.  The Bitwise real volume report of March 2019 also notes that Bitfinex used market surveillance tools to ""help detect market manipulations, such as spoofing and wash trading through the real-time and historical analysis of trades, order books and other market information.” This set it apart from some other exchanges Bitwise surveyed, including Binance. So did the fact that Bitfinex registered as a money services business with the U.S. Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).  As it turns out, the 20 assets making up the first quarterly construction of this filtered list comprise 99% of all the trading volume on the eight exchanges. What’s more, as of June 17, the current CoinDesk 20 represented $239.38 billion in market cap, according to data compiled by Messari. The remaining 5,145 cryptocurrencies were worth $25.85 billion. That makes the CoinDesk 20 representative of 90.3% of the entire cryptosphere’s market cap.  Check out: Bitcoin (BTC) Price Index on CoinDesk 20  By the same token, the CoinDesk 20 is not a ranking of the relative worth or importance of each crypto or blockchain project. It is not a judgment on the quality of the technology or the caliber of the team developing it. No doubt some readers will have strong opinions on why this or that asset should be in the CoinDesk 20 and why others shouldn’t be. No doubt, over time some newcomers will join this list and existing assets will drop off it. For now, though, these are the results of a clear, objective approach using reliable data.  Likewise, compiling the best data in crypto often requires trade-offs. Such is the case when viewing tether (USDT) on the CoinDesk 20 asset page. As we go live, the market cap shown for the stablecoin is roughly $6 billion. Yet, this is only the value of the token as found on the Ethereum blockchain. In fact, tether also operates on the Omni, Tron, EOS, Liquid, Algorand, and SLP networks. Those are valued at an additional $4.9 billion, and CoinDesk is working on a way to incorporate accurate and timely figures for these other blockchains into the total number.  More data  CoinDesk is doing more than just making a list of assets, however. In addition, investors, traders and researchers are provided with a deep dive into the data they need to make educated decisions about these 20 digital assets.  Each individual asset page contains information about the type of currency, its returns, volume, volatility, transactions, fees, value proposition and consensus mechanism, to name just a few of the data points. This will give anyone researching the asset a clearer sense of how it relates to others and to other asset classes.  The CoinDesk 20 is a new tool for analyzing a new space. We look forward to evolving it – carefully and gradually – as the field of digital assets progresses. We’ll certainly tweak the data we ingest and alter how we present it on our asset pages. We may even revisit the methodology based on new perspectives and reader feedback. We invite you to share yours. If you have thoughts on the CoinDesk 20, please share them at research@coindesk.com.  In an asset class that is often fraught with uncertainty, the CoinDesk 20 is meant to serve as an indispensable tool for the crypto investor. It’s a simple list of 20 assets, but behind that list is a sophisticated lens, one that reveals the true centers of gravity within the cryptocurrency market.",NEUTRAL,BTC | USDT,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,Lawrence Lewitinn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/08/introducing-the-coindesk-20-the-assets-that-matter-most-in-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0e99c8f59b8f5be578b66105cd71cbd1248dd640-1148x704.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

TCS is the second-largest company in India and a subsidiary of Tata Group, the multinational conglomerate with more than $120 billion in revenue in 2019.  Sumit Gupta, CEO of Indian crypto exchange CoinDCX, said the Indian crypto market, previously subdued because of a now-overturned central bank ban, is back with a bang.

Five funds are already using the ""Catalyst"" framework to create complex digital asset-based products that can be traded just like a regular stock, the cryptocurrency infrastructure provider said Wednesday.  Catalyst allows institutional investors to create and trade securitized versions of sophisticated strategies without trading or holding the digital assets themselves.  The underlying assets are custodied by Copper.  The funds already on board are using Catalyst to create securitized tokens based around arbitrage, yield and volatility trading strategies, Copper CEO Dmitry Tokarev told CoinDesk.  Another 10 are in the pipeline to use the service, Tokarev said.  Each security is an actively managed certificate (AMC), a highly flexible instrument akin to an exchange-traded fund that can be set up and issued in weeks.  The securities are given an official Swiss-registered International Securities Identification Number (ISIN).  They will be tradable on regulated European stock exchanges and subject to existing securities regulation.  Swissquote released its own volatility-tempered bitcoin AMC in November 2017, which is currently tradable on the Swiss SIX Exchange.  However, Copper's Catalyst is the first offering allowing funds to create and issue crypto-based AMCs, according to Tokarev.  London-based Copper offers infrastructure services for institutions; it released a trading tool to minimize credit risk exposure earlier this year.

42432241,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNBGJh,1594213232,New Enterprise Ethereum Director Widens Tent to Include Exchanges and DeFi,"Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA), the business end of the second-largest blockchain, has appointed a new executive director, Daniel C. Burnett.      Burnett, who previously worked as a standards architect within Ethereum-focused ConsenSys, wants to widen the EEA’s scope beyond banks and blue-chip stocks to include exchanges. Burnett even aims to embrace the brave new world of decentralized finance (DeFi), which has proven to be one of Ethereum’s major use cases.      “We should be seeing the exchanges as members, we should be seeing tooling vendors as members,” Burnett said in an interview. “It could be something in the API that they have to use for doing trades. If you have a business and if the existence of Ethereum is important to that business, then you should be in the EEA.”      It’s auspicious timing for Burnett’s arrival, given the public Ethereum mainnet turns five at the end of this month, and the EEA is planning a half-day seminar where its 100-plus member organization will go into more detail about its future plans. Outgoing EEA lead Ron Resnick is leaving the group to focus on the InterWork Alliance token initiative.      The EEA’s new horizons were also hinted at by John Whelan, chairman of the EEA board of directors and head of digital investment banking at Banco Santander.      Read more: Enterprise Ethereum Alliance Launches Testing Ground for Blockchain Interoperability      “It’s a good time to broaden the tent for all those businesses using Ethereum tech in all its various facets, whether big companies doing private permissioned, or other businesses beginning to pop up doing DeFi,” Whelan said in an interview.    DeFi growth    With $2 billion in crypto assets now committed to DeFi, the EEA could perhaps play a role in educating the traditional financial world about possible opportunities, Whelan added.      “At some point [DeFi companies] will cross into the realm of mainstream finance, and it may well be that regulators would like to have a single point of contact in the business community and we could imagine the EEA growing into that kind of role as well,” Whelan said.      Asked what sort of standards might be applied to the Wild West world of DeFi going forward, Burnett, a director of the IEEE Industry Standards and Technology Organization, said he wouldn’t want to speculate.      “Personally, I think it’s not my place.

Prime-broker plans    Nexo hopes this increased security will aid the company’s expansion into the prime brokerage business. The lender revealed in the same announcement it plans to build out a “complete prime brokerage product suite.” Earlier this year, Coinbase, Genesis Trading, Bequant and BitGo all announced plans to become prime brokers.

42384039,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0Ezb,1594213155,"As Gold Hits 9-Year High, Bitcoin Eyes Price Breakout","Bitcoin is looking to leap key resistance alongside a strong rally in gold.      The top cryptocurrency by market value is trading around $9,300 at press time, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. That's close to the resistance of a trendline connecting June 1 and June 22 highs. A sustained move past $9,330 would indicate an end of the bearish trend from the June 1 high of $10,429.      While bitcoin has yet to restore the immediate bullish trend and is trading 50% below its record high of $20,000, gold has jumped to a nine-year high of $1,801 per ounce, as per data source TradingView.      The hedge asset now sits just 6% short of the lifetime high of $1,920 reached in September 2011.      See also: First Mover: With Trading Volumes Slumping, Are There Too Many Crypto Exchanges?      The precious metal is likely drawing bids due to negative real (inflation-adjusted) yields offered by the US bonds, as noted by popular macro analyst Holger Holger Zschaepitz.      As seen above, the real yield has declined from 0.3% to -0.73% over the past 3.5 months. During the same period, gold has rallied from $1,450 to $1,800. Essentially, gold is performing as an inflation hedge.      Bitcoin also rallied from $3,867 to $10,400 in the two months leading up to its third reward halving on May 11. Since then, however, the rally has stalled and the cryptocurrency has failed multiple times to find a foothold above $10,000. More importantly, bitcoin's correlation with the S&P 500 index has strengthened, denting its appeal as a safe-haven asset.    Tip of the iceberg    Many analysts, however, remain optimistic about bitcoin’s long-term prospects.      “In the BTC market, there is an increased institutional acceptance and awareness of the asset class which should bode well for long-term price appreciation. We’ve seen prominent organizations and figures such as [Paul Tudor Jones], JPMorgan, Fidelity, which are publicly involved in the market, yet this is just the tip of the iceberg,"" said Stephen Stonberg, COO and CFO at Bittrex Global, a cryptocurrency exchange.      Legendary hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones allocated 1%-3% of his investment portfolio to bitcoin futures in May.      ”Bitcoin volatility has been lower than that of traditional assets throughout this crisis; however, we would argue there is nothing traditional about equity markets and the traditional economy today,"" Stongberg added. ""In this ‘new normal,’ bitcoin starts to look appealing as a new asset class that is not subject to the constraints and money printing of central banks.”      See also: Nearly $60M in Bitcoin Moved to Ethereum in June      The U.S. Federal Reserve has expanded its balance sheet by more than $3 trillion since the beginning of the coronavirus crisis in early March. However, the unprecedented money printing and the resulting concerns over inflation have mainly benefited gold. It remains to be seen if bitcoin takes up its expected role as an inflation hedge in the long run.      As for the next 24 hours or so, the focus is on the trendline resistance around $9,330. A strong move above that level would open the doors for $10,000. Alternatively, a move below the weekend low of $8,900 may invite stronger chart-driven selling.

42384040,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0F27,1594209311,"First Mover: With Trading Volumes Slumping, Are There Too Many Crypto Exchanges?","Bitcoin's notorious volatility has practically disappeared during the most recent phase of the coronavirus-induced economic crisis – and that's now taking a toll on trading volumes at cryptocurrency exchanges around the world.      For more than two months, bitcoin has stayed in a range between roughly $8,500 and $10,200, an astonishing stretch of stability for an asset whose price rose 13-fold in 2017, tumbled 73% in 2018 and then jumped 94% last year. It's up 29% so far in 2020, after wild gyrations earlier in the year that have mostly faded since late April.      The largest cryptocurrency changed hands Tuesday at $9,257, down 1% on the day. Yawn.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      According to CoinDesk Research, bitcoin's 30-day historical volatility has fallen to its lowest in more than a year.      The preternatural calm in the bitcoin market has sapped the enthusiasm of cryptocurrency traders long accustomed to bigger daily price swings and adrenaline rushes. Based on a new report, many traders are moving toward the sidelines.      The London-based data provider CryptoCompare wrote this week that trading volumes on top-tier cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, OKEx and Coinbase fell by 36% in June to $177 billion; on lower-tier exchanges, volumes tumbled by 53% to $466 billion.      Trading in cryptocurrency futures has also withered on venues like Chicago-based CME, according to the report.      ""The decline in bitcoin futures trading volume is mainly due to the continued decline in bitcoin volatility,"" OKEx CEO Jay Hao wrote Tuesday in a post on LinkedIn.      The price action is so uncharacteristically ""drowsy"" for bitcoin that the market is surely due for an awakening, the Norwegian cryptocurrency analysis firm Arcane Research wrote Tuesday in a report.      ""While the direction for bitcoin's next move is unclear, a large move is surely approaching,"" Arcane wrote.      In the meantime, the decline in trading volumes could rekindle questions over how many cryptocurrency exchanges are really needed to serve the nascent but fast-growing market.      The data site CoinGecko lists 391 cryptocurrency exchanges for spot trading and 33 for derivatives.      The multitude offers a marked contrast with the scenario in traditional financial markets, where trading volumes tend to aggregate on a few large exchanges. Think New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and Tokyo Stock Exchange for stocks, or the CME and Intercontinental Exchange for commodity futures.      Part of the explanation lies in just how fast and easy it is to build an exchange with digital-asset market technology focused on blockchain-enabled tokens. Setting aside the burden of meeting regulatory or compliance requirements, white-label offerings mean it can be almost like setting up a website (with added complexities like secure custody).      ChainUp, a Singapore-based provider of technology services to the blockchain industry, says on its website it has helped more the 300 crypto exchange clients.      ""Start an Exchange in 10 Minutes,"" the site reads.      Don Guo, CEO of Broctagon Fintech Group, which helps smaller cryptocurrency exchanges tap into bigger pools of liquidity available from large exchanges, says the business model is more akin to that of local or regional stock-brokerage firms that can survive with a smaller clientele.      ""It's not like traditional finance,"" Guo said in an interview via Microsoft Teams. ""People want to start exchanges. They want to launch their own netcoins or their own tokens, or they have their own communities.""      Eventually, ""there will definitely be consolidation"" in the industry because ""it's already a crowded space,"" says Stephen Stonberg, a former Goldman Sachs and Brevan Howard executive who now serves as chief operating officer of Liechtenstein-based Bittrex Global.      ""The market is so inefficient, which is why there are so many players,"" Stonberg said in an interview. ""I don't think you'll need state and local crypto exchanges. There's no need for that level of fragmentation.""      For now, cryptocurrency traders and exchanges alike might welcome an industry shake-up – in the form of a fresh bout of bitcoin price volatility.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,300 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,323 | 24-Hr Low: $9,216      Trend: The path of least resistance for bitcoin is on the higher side, according to daily chart indicators.      The MACD histogram, an indicator used to identify trend strength and direction, has crossed above zero for the first time since early June, signaling a bullish reversal. The indicator suggests that the bearish trend following the June high of $10,430 has ended.      A similar message is being delivered by the 14-day relative strength index, which has made an upside break of a two-month falling trendline.      In addition, volatility, as represented by the average true range (ATR) indicator, has declined to the lowest level since December 2019. In the past, BTC has witnessed upside breaks whenever ATR dropped to lows seen at press time, as noted by Adrian Zdunczyk, CEO of trading community The BIRB Nest.      As such, one may expect bitcoin to soon slice through the immediate resistance at $9,373 (50-day moving average) and challenge the psychological hurdle of $10,000. Bitcoin is currently trading near $9,300, representing a 0.50% gain on the day.      The cryptocurrency jumped 3% on Monday, confirming an upside break of a 10-day trading range of $8,830 to $9,300. Since then, however, the upside has been capped by the 50-day MA. ""The 50-day MA must be broken and reclaimed as support for bulls to continue and add to the local uptrend momentum,"" said Zdunczyk.      On the downside, the weekly opening price of $9,077 is the level to beat for the sellers. A violation there would validate the bearish crossover of the five- and 10-week averages and could yield a quick drop to $8,630 (May 25 low).",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/08/first-mover-with-trading-volumes-slumping-are-there-too-many-crypto-exchanges,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4946fc3ddc0538cd535ccf3c43c7632dd50cfad4-1500x963.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Konstantin Ignatov was expected to be sentenced on Wednesday.  Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss asked for the date to be moved by four months because Ignatov's cooperation with prosecutors is still in progress, according to a court filing dated July 7.  It appears the request has been granted, as Judge Edgardo Ramos at the District Court of the Southern District of New York is now presiding over a different case on the same time slot, Inner City Press pointed out.  No official court order has yet been filed on the matter.  Four sealed documents were filed last month, on June 16, relating to Ignatov and the OneCoin Ponzi scheme.  Ignatov was arrested by U.S. prosecutors in New York in March 2019 for his high-level involvement in the Ponzi scheme which is said to have stolen billions of dollars stolen from investors.  He is accused by U.S. prosecutors of acting as the personal assistant to Ruja Ignatova, OneCoin's top leader who is currently on the run from law enforcement. He is also her brother.  Konstantin has already had his sentencing adjourned from April 8, again to allow his cooperation to be completed.  He faces 90 years in prison, even after a plea deal on multiple counts of money laundering.  A jury convicted OneCoin's Lawyer Mark Scott on charges of fraud in November 2019 after it was revealed he laundered $400 million for the scheme.  Konstantin's testimony played a key role in the conviction.  Last Friday, a Singapore man was fined $72,000 after he was found guilty for promoting OneCoin based on the country's Multi-Level Marketing and Pyramid Selling (Prohibition) Act, 2000.

A spokesperson of the Chinese ride-hailing mobile service told CoinDesk in an email response that it has entered into a strategic partnership with the Digital Currency Research Institute of the People's Bank of China (PBoC) in an effort to accelerate the application of the CBDC, known as Digital Currency Electronic Payment, or DCEP.      ""Under PBoC’s overall DCEP strategy and operation timeline, Didi's DCEP taskforce will design and implement pilot DCEP projects in accordance with rigorous safety, security and governance standards,"" the firm said.      ""The partnership is a key milestone in Didi’s ongoing initiatives to enhance the interconnectivity of online and offline economic sectors in China, as the government seeks to support the development of the real economy sectors with innovative financial services,"" the firm added.      Read more: Just a Test: China Central Bank Confirms Digital Yuan Mobile App Trials      Didi is currently the dominant ride-hailing mobile service in China, after merging with a notable local rival in 2015 and acquiring Uber China, backed by investments from SoftBank, Apple, Alibaba and Tencent since its establishment in 2012.      While the details of the rollout are not yet clear, the pilot plan could see one of the first real applications of China's digital Yuan initiative as Didi touts a reach of over 500 million users in China, offering taxi hailing, private car hailing, automobile solutions, two-wheelers, logistics and delivery.      In May, Didi completed a $500 million fundraise for its autonomous driving subsidiary. The firm was most recently valued at over $60 billion, although the U.S. media outlet The Information said in an October 2019 report that investors had tried to exit at a lower valuation.      In recent months, leaked UI screen shots showed China's four largest state-owned commercial banks have been on a development and test run for a wallet application that'll be used to store, send and receive the DCEP.

As such, impromptu social media-based frenzies may be a fitting use case. Daily volume for the cryptocurrency stayed well below $5 million for the past two months.      “The recent rise of dogecoin, a meme coin, should serve as a reminder to everyone in the space that the most popular use case for crypto is still purely speculation,” said Anil Lulla, former analyst at Bloomberg and co-founder of cryptocurrency research firm Delphi Digital.      Global search interest in “how to buy dogecoin” also skyrocketed from a score of 25 to 100, the highest possible search popularity score, over the past few days, according to 12-month Google Trends data analyzed by CoinDesk.
