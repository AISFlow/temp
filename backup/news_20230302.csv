42414207,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB2v2O,1677800389,U.S. Lawmakers Argue SEC Accounting Policy Undermines Safe Crypto Custody,"Two Republican lawmakers who have been central to the U.S. Congress’ ongoing efforts toward regulating crypto are questioning government policies controlling how financial firms handle their accounting for cryptocurrency.  U.S. Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, and Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), who has authored crypto legislation, sent a letter to several banking agencies on Thursday asking how they’re dealing with a controversial bulletin from the Securities and Exchange Commission that advised financial institutions they should maintain customers’ crypto holdings on their own balance sheets.  The letter to the Federal Reserve and other U.S. banking agencies criticized the SEC’s move last year – known as Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 – as a measure that could “deny millions of Americans access to safe and secure custodial arrangements for digital assets,” because it would force regulated banks to reject crypto custody as something that comes with major capital demands.  “A recent decision in the Celsius [Network] bankruptcy, which classified all Celsius’ customers as unsecured creditors, and therefore at the back of the line to recover their assets, highlights the legal risk of effectively forcing customer custodial assets to be placed on balance sheet,” the lawmakers argued in their letter.  The letter questioned the banking agencies on what interactions they’ve had with the SEC on this point, and whether the securities regulator’s position conflicts with their own policies.  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell already said last year the central bank was evaluating the SEC’s directive, which – for digital assets – changes longstanding practice that customers’ assets would be kept off a financial firm’s balance sheet.

42411192,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glLsD4,1677798453,What Now for Crypto Banking?,"Crypto banking is in a mess. The collapse of the FTX exchange caused damaging runs on two U.S. regulated banks. One of them – Silvergate Capital Corp. – had to sell assets at a loss to repay depositors and lenders, and as a result has now warned that it may not be able to continue as a “going concern.” A third bank had to issue an emergency warning that those who had deposited fiat funds with its customer Voyager Digital did not have deposit insurance.  U.S. regulators are pressuring banks to withdraw banking services for crypto platforms and exchanges. And in a decision that sent shock waves across the crypto world, the U.S. Federal Reserve rejected a membership application from Custodia Bank, a full-reserve bank providing payment and custody services to crypto businesses. Where can crypto-related banking go from here?  Frances Coppola, a CoinDesk columnist, is a freelance writer and speaker on banking, finance and economics. Her book “The Case for People’s Quantitative Easing” explains how modern money creation and quantitative easing work, and advocates “helicopter money” to help economies out of recession.  The regulatory clampdown on crypto banking began in earnest on Jan 3, when the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of the Controller of the Currency (OCC) issued a joint statement on crypto-asset risks to banking organizations. We might wonder why they have only now, 14 years after the creation of Bitcoin and nine years after Tether first appeared, decided to cut the ties that bind the crypto ecosystem to the U.S. dollar system. But the answer is in their statement: “The events of the past year have been marked by significant volatility and the exposure of vulnerabilities in the crypto-asset sector. These events highlight a number of key risks associated with crypto-assets and crypto-asset sector participants that banking organizations should be aware of.”  They go on to give a comprehensive list of the risks they see in the present crypto ecosystem. Frauds and scams; legal uncertainties; inaccurate or misleading marketing (including claiming to have FDIC insurance) and “other practices that may be unfair, deceptive, or abusive”; crypto market volatility; run risk on stablecoin reserves; contagion risk due to extreme interconnectedness; poor risk management and governance; hacks and cyberattacks; generally heightened risk associated with open, public and/or decentralized networks. And they warn:  “It is important that risks related to the crypto-asset sector that cannot be mitigated or controlled do not migrate to the banking system.”  Read more: Crypto Bank Custodia's Bid for Fed Supervision Rejected Again  The message is clear. U.S. regulators think crypto is a serious threat to the traditional financial system. Not because it is going to take it over, but because it could bring it down.  For all their rhetoric about “unbanking yourself,” crypto exchanges, lenders and stablecoin issuers need access to banks. All dollar-denominated transactions except those made in physical notes and coins go through the U.S. banking system and are ultimately settled across the books of the New York Federal Reserve. Fintech payment apps such as Venmo and Zelle create the illusion that dollar payments can be made without involving banks. But a look under the hood of these companies reveals that they depend on a network of banks – indeed, Zelle is owned by a consortium of banks. And the same is true for international dollar payments.  Contrary to popular belief, international payments aren’t sent by SWIFT: SWIFT is merely a messaging service. Rather, just like domestic payments, international dollar payments are sent and received by banks and settled across the books of the New YorkFed. So it’s not possible for any crypto company, whether or not it has a U.S. presence, to accept or pay out fiat dollars unless it has a direct or indirect relationship with a U.S. bank.  Crypto companies also use banks to store the cash reserves that “back” customer deposits. But this isn’t strictly necessary: They could use money market mutual funds, for example, or hold short-term U.S. Treasury bills. And it’s also distinctly odd. Crypto companies like to claim that “unlike banks” they hold full reserves against customer deposits. But if the reserves are held in fractionally reserved banks, this isn’t true. It’s hard not to conclude that the real reason why many crypto companies hold cash in banks is so they can tell depositors they have some access to FDIC insurance. The FDIC has issued cease-and-desist orders to numerous companies, including the exchanges FTX and CEX, for falsely saying or implying FDIC insurance applied to their customer deposits.  But although payment and custody services are important banking functions, they are peripheral to the business model of a traditional bank. The business model of a traditional bank is to borrow at a low interest rate, lend at a higher interest rate and pocket the difference. Traditional banks are important liquidity creators and distributors, not only in financial markets but in the wider economy. As the U.S. discovered after the failure of Lehman Brothers in 2008, when banks stop lending the economy grinds to a halt. Crypto originally eschewed lending, but quickly discovered that without it the ecosystem was about as liquid as the surface of Mars. When there is much HODLing and little lending, liquidity is gold.  Read more: US Banking Regulators Warn Banks About Crypto Liquidity Risks  U.S. dollars are illiquid in the crypto ecosystem, so crypto companies don’t need lending services from traditional banks. And because they might have to pay out those scarce fiat dollars at a moment’s notice, they want any funds they deposit in traditional banks to be held in custody, not used as liquidity for the bank’s other activities. So crypto companies want a type of bank we don’t currently have: a “full-reserve” bank. In 2019, Wyoming created a charter for full-reserve banks. Its “special purpose depository institution” can receive deposits and provide asset management, custody and related services, but is not allowed to lend (though it can purchase certain types of debt securities) and must maintain unencumbered liquid assets of at least 100% of its total deposits.  Custodia Bank is a Wyoming SPDI. It does not lend, but provides payment and custody services:  “Custodia has all the benefits of being a bank with expertise in digital assets – plus, as a depository institution, we’re eligible to connect directly with the Federal Reserve payment system, removing middlemen and layers of fees."" In particular:  U.S. banks with direct access to the Federal Reserve via a master account can directly clear payments for their customers at the Federal Reserve, reducing the cost, delays, reconciliation headaches and counterparty risk involved with traditional intermediaries  Banks are defined as “qualified custodians” under the Investment Advisers Act and the SEC’s Custody Rule  Banks are defined as a “good control location” under the SEC’s Customer Protection Rule.”  A full-reserve, nonlending bank earning its profits solely from fees on payment and custody services sounds like a sensible solution to crypto’s banking needs. Indeed, many people might think it has wider application, too – after all, it’s not just crypto companies that need safe places to put their savings. If it is 100% reserved there’s no risk from bank runs, and if it is not lending it can’t become insolvent due to bad debts. Even though deposits in Custodia don’t have FDIC insurance, they are completely safe. So why has the Federal Reserve refused to accept Custodia as a member and denied it direct access to dollar clearing?  The problem is not Custodia, it’s the customers. Custodia offers banking and custody services exclusively to crypto businesses. And the Fed’s view of these is more than slightly jaundiced. It regards the entire crypto industry as a hotbed of financial crime. It’s hardly going to give the green light to a bank whose principal business is, in its view, enabling enterprises that are highly risky and at worst actually criminal to store and move U.S. dollars.  There’s a second problem: Custodia plans to issue its own token. The token would be a liability of Custodia exchangeable at par for U.S. dollars – a “tokenized dollar.” It would be fully reserved, and Custodia has applied for FDIC insurance. A regulated bank issuing fully reserved, FDIC-insured tokenized dollars that could be used on multiple blockchains seems like a great idea. It would make U.S. dollars considerably more liquid in the crypto space and reduce reliance on the likes of Tether. The problem is not the token, it’s the network.  Read more: Dan Kuhn - Before Silvergate and After Silvergate  Custodia plans to issue the token on Blockstream’s Liquid network and possibly also on Ethereum. These are public decentralized networks. Custodia would have no control over the ownership and distribution of such tokens. It would be as if it had issued its own banknotes. The joint regulator statement cited above says that issuing tokens on such networks is “highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices.” While regulators perceive crypto as a vehicle for money laundering, terrorist financing and ransomware, and the headlines are dominated by crypto-related frauds, scams and rug pulls, regulated banks are not going to be allowed to issue stablecoins on public networks.  If crypto companies stopped fighting the regulators and cleaned up their act, the Fed might look more favorably on banks providing services to them. But I’m not convinced Custodia’s business model makes commercial sense anyway. The reason why we don’t have full-reserve banks is that they are intrinsically less profitable than their fractional-reserve competitors. Historically, full-reserve banking has never lasted for long: Banks either find ways of leveraging customer deposits or they are bought by a fractional reserve bank or they go out of business.  The short-lived nature of full-reserve banking is already evident in the crypto world: Crypto lenders, exchanges and stablecoin issuers that promised depositors they were “fully reserved” have turned out to be anything but. In a world dominated by fractional reserve banks, I doubt if specialist full-reserve banks like Custodia would long survive.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | USDT,Frances Coppola,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/03/02/what-now-for-crypto-banking,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/08f3b07cd425d95d85c9329143471d8ae29842c6-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410818,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggrtKZ,1677792780,"Ethereum’s Shanghai Upgrade Will Not Crash Ether Price, Analysts Say","Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade, which will allow withdrawals for some $29 billion of staked ether (ETH) previously locked starting next month, is unlikely to cause major selling pressure and crash ETH’s price, crypto analysts told CoinDesk.  The analysts say investors’ fear the enhancement will send prices tumbling by flooding the market with ETH are misplaced. They say the volume of ETH outflows will be less significant than many observers are predicting.  “I believe withdrawals and inflows from new stakers will be netted out,” Nick Hotz, vice president of research at digital asset investment firm Arca, told CoinDesk.  Crypto markets are eagerly anticipating the Shanghai tech upgrade, the next major development, scheduled for April, since last year's Merge. It will allow investors to unlock and withdraw ETH tokens from staking for the first time since December 2020, when staking commenced on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake Beacon Chain.  Many crypto investors worry the event could potentially create a significant overhang for ETH’s price, which trades at $1,645 currently, research firm Bernstein and others noted recently. They think long-time stakers may opt for unlocking a large part of the 17.5 million ETH, worth $28.8 billion, in staking contracts and dump it on the market to realize profits.  Yet, Arca’s Hotz said the impact of ETH outflows will not be immediate because withdrawals will have to endure a so-called queue. “This means only 10% of the total amount of staked ETH can be removed from the pool in a month,” he said. “So, you will have a churn.”  John “Omakase” Lo, head of digital assets at investment firm Recharge Capital, said people will not rush to exit staking as they will need time to understand how Shanghai works. “There will be a period while investors will digest how withdrawals work,” he said.  Rich Falk-Wallace, chief executive of institutional crypto data platform Arcana, said the key driver of ETH price action will be what narrative the market creates about the long-term outlook based on the short-term behavior.  “If stakers steadily withdraw and do not show interest in validating the network, that would be bearish,” he said. “If ETH staking percentage continues to grow post-Shanghai, that is a net positive.”  Read more: What Is the Ethereum Blockchain’s Shanghai Hard Fork, and Why Does It Matter?  Limited selling pressure  Many market observers do not appreciate how severely Ethereum’s withdrawal system limits the amount of ETH withdrawn at a time, Falk-Wallace said.  Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade will deploy a two-tier withdrawal system. Partial withdrawals, amounts above 32 ETH, will be usually executed immediately but initially Arcana expects them to be distributed within three days due to the queue. Full withdrawals, which is the minimum staking amount of 32 ETH, will take more time and be released gradually.  There’s $1.2 billion of ETH in the partial withdrawal bucket, according to Arcana’s analysis, implying that in the worst-case scenario only 6% of the average daily ETH trading volume could hit the market in each of the first three days after allowing withdrawals. Later, the maximum daily amount of ETH potentially dumped on the market will decrease below 1% of the daily trading volume in the next six months.  In a report published Thursday, crypto research firm CryptoQuant forecast modest selling pressure for ETH from staking withdrawals. According to the report, some 60% of all ETH staked are currently in loss at current prices relative to the price at the moment each token was staked.  “Selling pressure emerges when market participants are sitting on extreme profits, which is not the case right now,” CryptoQuant said.  Read more: Shanghai + Capella = 'Shapella.' How Ethereum Devs Now Refer to Upcoming Upgrade  Liquid staking derivatives  The emergence of liquid staking derivatives (LSD), which let ETH stakers keep their investments liquid and trade by issuing derivative tokens such as stETH, also will damp the outflows.  Most investors stake ETH using liquid staking platforms such as Lido or Coinbase, Hotz said. Thus they don’t need to withdraw and sell to get liquidity.  “Those who stake privately and run their own validator nodes are diehard fans,” he added. “Pulling out once withdrawals are allowed is probably not the first thing in their mind.”  Read more: What the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade Will Mean for ETH Liquidity  ETH staking will grow  The staking ratio on the Ethereum blockchain is currently much lower compared to other chains’ figures, including Polkadot’s 48%, Cardano’s and Solana’s 71% or Polygon’s 38%, according to data from StakingRewards.  Arcana’s Falk-Wallace expects that Ethereum’s staking ratio will converge on other proof-of-stake blockchains after Shanghai as new stakers come online, outpacing withdrawers.  “We think ETH staking [percentage] is likely to increase secularly from 14% today into the 30%-50% range over the next 18 months to get closer to parity with other proof-of-stake blockchains,” he said.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | FORKS,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/02/ethereums-shanghai-upgrade-will-not-crash-ether-price-analysts-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/21695d7db1331b45bb4fb0305ceb93db0b7b13dc-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin miner Riot Platforms (RIOT) delayed the filing of its annual 10-K report with the Securities and Exchange Commission due to issues raised by its accounting firm about the company's impairment calculations related to its bitcoin assets.  “After assessing the impact of this revised impairment assessment methodology, the Registrant determined that material errors in certain of its financial statements and reports resulted,” Riot wrote in its SEC filing on Thursday.  Specifically, Riot said its previously issued financial statements for 2022, 2021 and 2020 “contained material errors and should not be relied upon.”  For those reasons, Riot said it needed additional time to complete its 10-K and it has since done so and filed its report for 2022.

42421357,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnsoX,1677792022,Regulators Are Bringing the Multichain Era to a Close,"As firms add more and more blockchains to their strategic road maps, I grow more and more frustrated. Where, I keep wondering, do firms have the money to properly understand and implement such an enormous array of blockchains in their operations? At EY, it costs us about $500,000 to add a new chain to our Blockchain Analyzer platform and we spend between 10%-20% of that amount each year keeping up to date.  While setting up network nodes may not be too difficult, understanding how networks operate and the mechanics of transfers and payments is another matter. When we add a network, we take a close look at the transaction processing model (how transactions are initiated, recorded, processed and reported); the cryptography that underpins those transactions; and the risks that might be associated with different steps in the process. When it comes to audits, we even identify control points where we can perform verification steps.  Paul Brody is EY's global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist.  Nor are these networks static entities. Ethereum has two to four hard forks a year and other smart contract-enabled chains evolve at a similar rate. The result: Staying up to date on a large number of different blockchains is costly.  Cost isn’t the only factor, either. Liquidity becomes an issue as well. Polling Automated Market Makers (AMM) for their sample prices by volumes of proposed swaps on different token pairs shows how quickly liquidity drops off once you leave the Ethereum blockchain. Even within public Ethereum, trading is highly concentrated among the top tokens. Tokens without liquidity are much more vulnerable to price manipulation.  Insufficient liquidity in an inadequately regulated market is one of the main reasons the Securities and Exchange Commission has rejected applications for bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETF). The last year has shown, time and again, that crypto asset prices are often manipulated. So these concerns are unlikely to go away and will increasingly deter firms for interacting with, or transacting upon, less-liquid ecosystems.  Read more: Paul Brody - Policymakers Should Embrace DAOs in the New Future of Abundance  As if it wasn’t complicated enough, just deciding which chains to add is a constantly changing mix. Over the last few years, there has been a constant stream of “Ethereum killer” chains taking up the #2 spot in the ecosystem. A good measure of “who’s on top” is the DeFiLlama scorecard showing Ethereum dominance of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. DeFiLlama tracks nearly 140 different chains. At various times, Binance, Terra, Tron and Celo have been in second place, but none has ever represented more than about 20% of the total DeFi ecosystem value. Usually the second chain by volume is at 10% or less.  Nor is Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility a useful factor in de-risking a chain’s adoption. EVM compatibility means that (in theory) applications written for Ethereum’s virtual machine will run on any other chain making that claim. Theory doesn’t always match reality exactly, however. As a result, EVM compatibility may actually increase risk.  EVM compatibility is not perfect and the implementation on each chain is slightly different. While this can definitely make it simpler to deploy new smart contracts on a different chain, they may behave differently in a fully “compatible” environment and the claim of compatibility may increase risk that people deploy without careful consideration. We often encounter novel errors when moving smart contracts from bitcoineum testnets to the mainnet. I don’t see cross-chain deployment being easier under any conditions.  Read more: Paul Brody - There Will Be No Lessons Learned From FTX  All of this aligns with our own experience, which has shown that the amount of work required to qualify a new asset or service for our audit tools on Ethereum is significantly lower than other chains. That’s because we already have a strong understanding of the underlying ecosystem. Ethereum also offers far more liquidity than any other chain, all of it inside the same ecosystem with no cross-chain bridge risk.  One way to anticipate how a much more regulated future looks is to examine how the biggest centralized or traditional finance firms are looking at the market for crypto assets. These firms are highly regulated and need to document their processes and work extensively to demonstrate they are not mishandling their client responsibilities. What you will see, over and over again, is that many of the biggest regulated firms have largely limited their offerings to BTC and ether (ETH) and have been very slow to grow that footprint.  When the most regulated firms do start adding to the mix, my own prediction is they will begin by adding more tokens from the Ethereum ecosystem and, perhaps, adding curated sets of DeFi services from Ethereum as well. I had, in the past, expected that we would have seen this expansion during 2022. But the market turmoil and increased regulatory scrutiny in the second half of last year caused many firms to move more slowly and increase their focus on compliance.  All of these challenges were much easier to ignore when every chain was growing, venture-capital funding was plentiful and regulatory scrutiny was light. All those sunny conditions are gone now and the game is different.

42421347,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnsdB,1677790902,Will DeFi Emerge From Crypto Winter Stronger?,"We’ve all heard about hibernation, when animals in the wilderness conserve energy during periods of unfavorable weather conditions and food shortages. Bears, for example, reduce their metabolic state in the winter to conserve energy, only to later emerge in the spring leaner and stronger. The last few months in crypto has shown that decentralized finance (DeFi) is no stranger to a chilling winter – or bears, for that matter.  The total value locked across decentralized finance has fallen to about $50 billion, around one-third of its former high watermark in May 2022. While the question on DeFi’s potential to progress into a disintermediated and immutable financial system remains, there have been some meaningful progressions.  Chelsea Virga is vice president of Galaxy Digital’s strategic opportunities team.  In the aftermath of FTX’s collapse, billions of dollars flowed into decentralized exchanges (DEX) from centralized entities, doubling trading volumes in November alone. Even amid crypto’s market tumult, decentralized exchanges and lending platforms have functioned smoothly compared to some of their centralized peers. DeFi’s core features – such as smart contracts that have settlement instructions embedded in code and safety features including over-collateralized lending standards – explain how Maker, Aave and Compound successfully retrieved $400 million from a financially compromised borrower, Celsius Network. Meanwhile, that centralized borrower that has since declared bankruptcy and still has over $1 billion in outstanding liabilities to repay.  To unlock its potential, DeFi needs a narrative overhaul. For too long many protocols attracted users by dangling unsustainable yields – such as during the heated days of “DeFi Summer,” which was fueled in part by an accommodative macro backdrop. Since then interest rates have climbed, inflation has soared and the “risk-free” rate of return on six-month Treasury bills breached 5%, pulling interest (no pun intended) away from the blockchain.  A changing macroeconomic environment has had a ripple effect. A few months ago, after Coinbase increased its USDC rewards to 2.36%, DeFi giant MakerDAO voted to increase its DAI savings rate tenfold to 1% to remain competitive. Ondo Finance, an on-chain project focused on tokenizing U.S. Treasurys and corporate bonds launched a couple months back with the intention to offer “share class” tokens useful on other DeFi platforms as on-chain collateral.  DeFi’s future success lies in the creation of a financial offering that can improve upon centralized finance (CeFi) products. We’ve already snuck a peak at inventive concepts like distributed ledger technology (DLT) clearing and settlement, liquid staking, on-chain underwriting and zero-knowledge (ZK) privacy technology. These are all ideas that can drive efficiency in DeFi’s offering and underwriting systems.  See also: How to Avoid the Death of DeFi in the Wake of FTX | Opinion  Much of this activity is as dependent on regulators as smart contract engineers. Germany’s financial watchdog, BaFin, has acted proactively in regulating blockchain by issuing legislation on aspects like initial coin offerings, security token offerings and decentralized apps (dapps). Its approach may provide financial stability while still fostering innovation.  This is an area in which the U.S. is still gaining clarity. Securities and Exchange Commission Commissioner Hester Peirce has stated she believes regulation requires a nuanced approach where investor protection is prioritized without stifling technological progress. Peirce remarked in January that “regulation should foster an environment where good things flourish and bad things perish, not the other way around.” A unified framework needs to be implemented before many institutions will consider making the leap. In the meantime, DeFi continues to build.  Asset offerings and liquidity  Historically, CeFi has been the predominant liquidity provider for financial instruments in crypto, such as cash-settled perpetual forwards and other derivatives, primarily because they are more cost-effective for leverage seekers from a collateral perspective. However, this is changing rapidly due to distrust of centralized exchanges. On the back of the FTX exchange’s collapse, permissionless spot and swap exchange GMX more than doubled its protocol revenue in November to $16.7 million. Decentralized exchange dYdX gained 16,000 users between September 2022 and year’s end.  Another trend in DeFi has been liquid staking, which allows for users to earn yield from staking while still participating in DeFi activities. The Ethereum-based staking platform Lido’s utility token has seen an impressive increase in price since the start of this year, and there are over $9.4 billion of assets staked on its platform. Platforms like Lido take in assets, use those as staked collateral and provide alternative tokens users can utilize on their platform – a process that has a CeFi parallel in “repo transactions.”  Enabling a larger complex of assets on-chain will be key to enticing more activity and entrants to the DeFi market. Value generation will come from tokenizing real-world assets like money markets, real estate mortgages, trade finance and infrastructure loans, among others. With distributed ledger technology, DeFi has the potential to provide cheaper financing options through fractionalization and reducing the cost of entry for investors. Blockchain can drive a wider range of assets available to investors, ultimately building portfolio diversification.  There is a domino effect at play here. Last year MakerDAO, the largest DeFi protocol with $8.6 billion in total value locked, pushed further into traditional asset financing, with five traditional finance asset vaults and a $30 million DAI loan using bond token collateral out to a subsidiary of French finance juggernaut Société Générale. Then, a few months ago, private-equity giant KKR tokenized exposure to its $4 billion health-care fund on Avalanche. Subsequently, in November, Apollo announced plans to offer an upcoming fund on a public blockchain through Figure. Just last month Hong Kong’s government issued its first tokenized green bond worth around $100 million through Goldman Sachs’ tokenization protocol GS DAP.  These innovations show how traditional finance and decentralized finance continue to intertwine, or at least how many existing financial products can be reproduced on public blockchains.  Pricing models and risk management  DeFi’s fire was originally ignited by automated market maker (AMM) technology, such as Uniswap, where algorithms would facilitate token trading through a mathematical formula to determine asset prices. Nowadays DEXs like dYdX are increasingly implementing central limit order books (CLOB) similar to traditional exchanges where a database matches buy and sell orders for a particular asset. In some cases, market makers can be added through a request for quote (RFQ) integration to further supplement liquidity. Pairing AMMs with professional market makers bolsters liquidity and pricing execution.  See also: What Is an Automated Market Maker? - AMMs Explained | Learn  An important consideration for all decentralized financial operations is how to optimize loan underwriting and ensure the collateral requirements are safe. DeFi lenders often require overcollateralization for lending. In other words, they require traders to pledge assets worth more than their loans.  Composable DeFi platforms provide innovative ways of collateralization. For instance, cross-margining, the process of cumulatively calculating a trader’s margin through calculating their unrealized profit and loss statements (more commonly shortened to “PnL”), is a valuable progression we’ve seen over the last cycle.  Lending protocols Aave and Compound allow for users to lever up based on loan to value ratios (LTV) and curate a single health factor that considers all their positions. DEXs like dYdX similarly allow for users to offset their trading losses with wins, and some are even offering partial liquidation protections (so if it comes to it, only the worst-performing part of a portfolio gets liquidated). While traditional prime brokerage offerings to funds remain more robust, these developments are a step in the right direction.  Flash loan smart contracts have been another interesting mechanism to reduce borrower defaults. For example, suppose a user is looking to fund a profitable arbitrage trade by borrowing capital unsecured. Smart contracts can consolidate the entire transaction from borrowing to repayment in an instant transaction, and will not fully execute if repayment will not occur.  Blockchain’s transparency can also be a benefit to risk management. Its immutable ledger gives users the ability to verify the ownership and movement of assets. Multiple projects are working along these lines, trying to use on-chain data to provide indications of creditworthiness and validation of real-time financial positions. That info can be used in tandem with off-chain financials to develop credit scores.  Zk-SNARKs (zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge) will be an additional DeFi catalyst. In a nutshell, ZK technology will help parties examine whether or not a specific statement is true, without revealing any additional information beyond the statement itself. This can enable organizations to securely transact with others while still preserving some confidential financial information.  User interface and cross-chain accessibility  To reach mainstream adoption, user interfaces will need to improve. Wallets and decentralized applications (dapp) should be intuitive enough for all users – especially those new to crypto. Developers need to take a similar approach to the development of personal computers in the early 1990s, which focused on accessibility.  One user-friendly concept gaining traction among people interested in DeFi security is “account abstraction,” or a tailored approach to wallet recovery. This is an alternative to simply telling traders to take custody of their keys – “not your keys, not your coins.” Trading platforms like Argent.xyz allow select users or devices to act as guardians to help recover a wallet on a new phone. These social recovery features can make transacting on-chain safer.  Centralized exchanges in the past cycle were able to draw users from a widening array of layer 1 blockchain ecosystems. By contrast, DeFi projects are often limited by the chain they’re deployed on. For ether (ETH) to end up on it needs to pass via a bridge; a cumbersome experience will limit mainstream growth.  See also: DeFi Is the Way Forward, but It Needs to Evolve | Opinion (December 2022)  This is already changing. DeFi projects such as Osmosis, born in the interoperable Cosmos ecosystem, are using underlying cross-chain infrastructure providers, such as Axelar, to bring in users from any chain. Axelar enables Osmosis to create one-time deposit addresses for users similar to a centralized exchange. Osmosis is based on Cosmos, but it can accept tokens from Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains and beyond. (Axelar is a portfolio company of Galaxy.)  While Ethereum has been the dominant player for DeFi, the network’s congestion and significant gas fees remain a potential hurdle. At this point in blockchain’s evolution, DeFi is increasingly filled with alternative layer 1 and layer 2 high throughput systems, which scale transaction counts at a fraction of the price.  With the expansion of its product offering, improvements in pricing and accessibility, upgrades to user experience and enhancements in cross-chain capabilities, DeFi can emerge from crypto winter as a stronger animal. These major shifts will require a collaborative effort made up of innovation from developers, clarity from regulators and continuous feedback from users.  Vincent Van Gogh likened convention to “a paved road: It’s comfortable to walk,but no flowers grow on it.” DeFi has an opportunity to revolutionize traditional financial markets in the next upturn for cryptocurrency broadly – but only if we use the current crypto winter to rebuild the infrastructure that will let new things flourish.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,Chelsea Virga,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/03/02/will-defi-emerge-from-crypto-winter-stronger,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b21b7154b924c722586c167119fb5e1b4a0af723-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414215,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB2vdX,1677790421,Bitcoin Price Holds Steady Above $23K as Silvergate Capital Crumbles,"Bitcoin (BTC) wobbled a bit early Thursday as crypto-friendly bank Silvergate Capital (SI) shed more than 50% of its value on worries it may not survive, but turned upward in afternoon trading and is now higher by 0.4% over the past 24 hours at $23,500.  California-based Silvergate said in a filing late Wednesday that ​​the impact of recent events – notably the FTX exchange collapse and subsequent regulatory inquiries – raised questions about the bank's ability to ""continue as a going concern.” The news led to at least two sell-side downgrades and a wide range of crypto firms pulling their business from the lender. Shares were down 58% shortly before the close of Thursday trade.  Unlike, for instance, the FTX collapse in November, which sent bitcoin plunging to multi-year lows, the looming concerns on Silvergate had little effect on the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value. The price of bitcoin on Thursday remained in the mid-$23,000 area.  That the news around Silvergate has not been working as a negative catalyst “has to be seen as a positive,” said Julius de Kempenaer, senior technical analyst at StockCharts.com.  “If they (crypto traders) really would be panicking, we should have seen that in the price by now,” Kempenaer told CoinDesk in an email. “Maybe things will worsen down the road, but for the time being the markets seem to be able to digest this without too much problem.”  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, was up 0.5% to about $1,650. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which measures overall crypto market performance, was up 0.06% for the day.  Looking at traditional markets, equities turned green Thursday afternoon, with the S&P 500 up 0.8%. Market participants across the board are eyeing the Federal Open Market Committee meeting later this month, with over 30% of traders now expecting the FOMC to ditch the recent 25-basis point moves and hike rates 50-basis points, the CME FedWatch Tool showed.  Federal Reserve speakers “continue to talk about higher for longer, and some are even alluding to the difficulty of achieving a soft landing,” said Singapore-based crypto options trading firm QCP Capital in a Telegram note.  “I think a lot of observers are expecting sideways action in the market for a prolonged period of time,” Jake Boyle, chief commercial officer at crypto brokerage Caleb and Brown, told CoinDesk. Looking to curb stickier than hoped inflation, the Fed, he said, “[is] bound and determined to keep financial conditions tight for a good while.”  For the price of BTC, “the rhythm of higher highs and higher lows (uptrend) is still in place and will remain in place until the recent low at $22,800 is taken out downward,” StockCharts.com’s Kempenaer said. “Such a break will be the first sign of weakness.” Kempenaer sees more serious support around $21,400.  “What a potential positive catalyst could remain to be seen, but when BTC can take out the overhead supply around $25,000 the outlook will certainly improve,” he added.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/02/bitcoin-price-holds-steady-above-23k-as-silvergate-capital-crumbles,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/19937d6a34956518441acf207e45e45a82678aa9-1124x572.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

MacroStrategy, MicroStrategy’s subsidiary that handles its bitcoin purchases and holdings, received a $205 million loan from Silvergate Bank in March 2022 through its Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN) Leverage program. The loan is due in the first quarter of 2025 and that timing will not change, the company wrote in its tweet.  “We have a loan from Silvergate not due until Q1 ‘25,” MicroStrategy said. “For anyone wondering, the loan wouldn’t accelerate because of Silvergate’s insolvency or bankruptcy.”  Multiple crypto companies, including Coinbase, Paxos, Galaxy Digital and Kraken, have ended their relationships with the bank following its filing news on Wednesday.

BTC was changing hands at about $23,400, down slightly but roughly in the middle of its range over the last week. ETH also remained squarely rangebound.  Initial jobless claims decreased by 2,000 from a week prior to 190,000, falling below expectations of 195,000. The week-over-week decline offers the latest evidence of a job market that remains exceedingly tight, leaving it more likely to put upward pressure on prices.  To be sure, forecasts can be overly optimistic or pessimistic for a number of reasons, but jobless data from recent weeks has been moving in the opposite direction of what the U.S. Federal Rewerve’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is seeking.  The FOMC has implied that initial jobless claims must increase to relieve inflationary pressures, but jobless claims have not risen since Feb 5. However, the four-week average of initial jobless claims has moved higher, to 193,000 from 191,250 in the prior week. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and various governors have noted their concerns about the stubbornly robust employment market on multiple occasions.  The U.S. labor force participation rate of 62.4 (62.4%) remains below pre-pandemic levels, while “U-6” unemployment rate, which accounts for part-time and marginally employed individuals, is 6.6%, holding relatively stable since June 2022.  FOMC will be hoping the U.S. Labor Department’s release of updated labor force participation and U6 unemployment on March 10 will show a decline in the former and increase in the latter. Even minimally, more promising trends for each would likely allow the Fed to scale back its recent diet of hawkish interest rate hikes, which, based on recent history, would please crypto investors. Markets over the past 15 months have tended to fall amid discouraging jobs and price indicators but risen on upbeat news.  Ether’s price sank during the hour of the jobs data release, while bitcoin’s price moved higher. (Both traded lower before reversing course as the day evolved.)  ETH’s initial price decline appears to have been a reaction to economic data, while BTC’s push higher was likely buttressed by the emergence of Bitcoin ordinals, a protocol that allows for the creation of non-fungible tokens (NFT) on the Bitcoin blockchain.  Still, crypto markets continued the recent theme of being relatively disconnected from traditional markets as major indexes were recently ticking upward.

The Near protocol currently ranks as the 35th largest blockchain in terms of market capitalization, according to data from Messari.

42414218,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB2vtS,1677786624,Former NBA Player Baron Davis Says Celebs Will Focus More on 'Utility' Tokens,"Former National Basketball Association player Baron Davis still sees a silver lining for celebrities who endorse crypto even though the U.S. Securities and Commission is cracking down on celebrity and athlete-endorsed projects.  He told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Thursday that celebrities are now likely to focus on projects that can give users real utility and rewards.  “Going forward, you're gonna see more creative projects out of celebrities and athletes bringing you directly to their fanbase, to their ecosystem,” he said.  Davis, a serial entrepreneur who spent 13 years playing for seven teams in the NBA, is turning to blockchain technology as he creates his own NFT-based platform called SLiC Images, which will manage digital copyrights and databases for sports photographers.  The project, which is still under development, will live on non-fungible-token platform Mintbase. By using blockchain technology, the platform is “building out a core database and a publishing back end that allows these photographers to be able to license their photos” on social-media websites and in magazines, Davis said.  A lack of education and attention to detail may in part be why some celebrities fell short of finding their place in crypto in the past, Davis said. Last October, reality television star Kim Kardashian agreed to pay the SEC $1.26 million to settle changes that she failed to disclose payments she received for touting EthereumMax’s EMAX token.

42411960,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glhkAu,1677785659,3 Simple Ways to Get Crypto Market Exposure,"Bitcoin still represents a significant share of the digital asset market  Although bitcoin (BTC) represented nearly the entire digital asset market 10 years ago, the number of protocols developed has skyrocketed in recent years. In November 2014, when the first crypto index, the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX), was launched, bitcoin made up 91% of the entire crypto market share as measured by market capitalization. If investors wanted to invest in the crypto market, they could only use bitcoin or a tracking product. However, as the market grew, bitcoin’s dominance diminished, to the point that it is now less than half the market at 41%. But that hasn’t changed the appetite for bitcoin as the leading asset or for simple market exposure.  Major Crypto Assets by Percentage of Total Market Capitalization (Bitcoin Dominance Chart)     Moving beyond bitcoin into the largest, most liquid blue-chip digital assets  One of the most generally accepted ways to get the market beta in any asset class is with the largest, most liquid assets that are weighted by size. These types of indices are widely used in asset allocation, risk models, benchmarking, and passive investing. Therefore, the CoinDesk Digital Large Cap Select (DLCS) applies the traditional market index concepts of size and liquidity, along with select eligibility criteria, to cover the digital asset market. Although bitcoin represents less market share than it once did, digital assets are still emerging, so the landscape is heavily concentrated in the currency and smart contract platform sectors as well as BTC and ether (ETH).  Currently, DLCS covers over 83% of the total market capitalization (ex-stablecoins) by including BTC, ETH, ADA, MATIC and SOL holding 66.4%, 28.9%, 1.9%, 1.4%, and 1.3% respectively.  Large caps are most familiar, though multi-sector exposure is valuable  As in traditional markets, there is often demand for a more well-diversified exposure that covers a variety of sectors. Although DLCS covers most of the market by size, its current constituents are only assigned to the Currency and Smart Contract Platform sectors in CoinDesk DACS. Therefore, the CoinDesk Market Select Index (CMIS) includes the largest and most liquid digital assets from each of the DACS sectors that meet the select eligibility criteria. At the moment, 28 assets from five DACS sectors are market capitalization-weighted and account for approximately 89% of the digital asset market (excluding stablecoins).  Although the CMIS digital assets beyond those in DLCS add slightly more market cap coverage, CMIS offers exposure across sectors and allows investors to express sector views by using the individual Select Sector Indices as tools to manage exposures.  CoinDesk Market Select Index Sector Weights (Number of Assets)  As the crypto market continues to develop and become more complex with a greater number of digital assets that are less concentrated, DLCS provides a simple way to measure the market with the largest and most liquid assets that enable passive exposure to the asset class. However, CMIS provides greater exposure across the sectors with a broader set of select digital assets that include smaller but popular sectors such as DeFi and Culture & Entertainment.",NEUTRAL,ADA | BTC | ETH,ADA | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET,Jodie Gunzberg - CoinDesk Indices,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/coindesk-indices/2023/03/01/3-simple-ways-to-get-crypto-market-exposure,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a2296275e801777a81bb8369779088939e562a77-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
10188142,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4583956-stacks-narrative-driving-hype?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1677785612,Stacks: The Narrative Driving The Hype,"Summary Stacks is a smart contract blockchain that utilizes Bitcoin miners and BTC in a ""proof of transfer"" blockchain model. The native coin of the Stacks blockchain is STX. STX has rallied from $0.20 to over $1.00 over the last few weeks. Much of that rally is in response to the continued adoption of the Ordinals NFT project on Bitcoin. Ordinals and Stacks are two completely separate things. So the STX rally is being driving more by expectations than fundamental usage. In recent weeks, one of the best performing digital assets in the broader market has been Stacks ( STX-USD ). After rallying from just $0.21 at the end of 2022 all the way to $0.97 on Monday, STX has nearly 5x'd in just a matter of a few weeks. Surely there's a fundamental story behind this move, right? What is Stacks? How one should classify the Stacks blockchain is actually a point of some debate among crypto enthusiasts. There are some who say it is a Layer 2 scaling chain built on top of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). And there are others who say it is a ""side-chain"" and not a true Layer 2 like Bitcoin's Lightning Network. The major sticking point from those who say it's a side chain seems to be the existence of the STX token. Lightning utilizes BTC to scale rather than a native coin which is why the L2 designation doesn't seem to be up for argument. Stacks.co From a mechanical standpoint, the Stacks blockchain utilizes the Bitcoin miners and what is essentially a BTC deposit model called ""proof of transfer"" for generating BTC yields for STX holders and Stacks network security. The model has come under some scrutiny because it asks the Bitcoin miners to use BTC to ""bid"" on the STX block reward. This could theoretically be a problem for Stacks if the STX token falls in price too fast against BTC. This scenario might disincentivize bidding BTC for STX yields if the real yield is negative. Functionally, Stacks is a smart contract blockchain that enables DeFi, NFTs, and domain services. Stacks also features something called ""City Coins"" which are designed to allow market participants to essentially make bets on specific jurisdictions. I'll withhold my personal commentary on City Coins as I think the performance of MiamiCoin speaks for itself. The NFT Narrative The main driver of the recent rally in STX appears to be the emergence of NFTs on Bitcoin as an idea. The ability to create NFTs that are secured by Bitcoin is a major selling point from the Stacks website : As with fungible tokens, NFTs on the Stacks blockchain are created with Clarity smart contracts. Because of the relationship between Stacks and Bitcoin, NFTs created on Stacks settle to and are secured by Bitcoin. There is some legitimacy to the notion that Bitcoin will develop a larger NFT ecosystem as we've already seen a big spike in NFTs minted on Bitcoin blocks through the Ordinals protocol: Ordinals Mints (Dune Analytics/ilemi) Since launch, there have been roughly a quarter of a million Ordinals NFTs minted on Bitcoin. What's interesting though is Ordinals and Stacks have absolutely nothing to do with one another. Ordinals is a protocol that utilizes Taproot to mint NFTs using Bitcoin's block space. The Ordinals protocol never touches Stacks or the STX token. Nevertheless, it appears that STX could be rallying because of Ordinals despite no direct connection with that protocol. Stacks Network As far as Stacks goes, the network growth of that chain has been much less clear. According to the Stacks website, the protocol has over $400 million in TVL but that figure is benefiting from the surge in the USD price of the native STX token. When measured in STX, the ""cycles,"" or stacking periods, have actually seen steady declines in STX that has been stacked going back to cycle 46: STX TVL (Stacking.Club) In fact the last completed cycle (number 52) had just 357 million STX tokens stacked, the lowest since cycle 15. In that cycle there were 153 stackers. This seems to be a continuation of a larger trend down in the number of stackers as time goes on. Average Stacked Stackers Miners Q4-21 421.8m STX 222 6 Q1-22 449.6m STX 213 7 Q2-22 498.6m STX 199 7 Q3-33 493.3m STX 184 7 Q4-22 511.2m STX 168 8 Source: Messari Messari's recently published Stacks note shows some additional problems. With just 8 Bitcoin miners participating last quarter and slow growth, there are centralization concerns in the early goings of the Stacks network. But still, I'd be more worried about the declining number of Stackers than anything else. Messari The surge in real volume reported by Messari coupled with the declines in the number of STX making it into stacking cycles would seem to corroborate the idea that the recent activity in the price of STX has more to do with speculation than anything else. That said, there is an interesting development that is expected to garner a large technical improvement to the Stacks blockchain this year. In December, the Stacks team announced the ""Nakamoto release"" and the sBTC token. One of the major constraints of Stacks is the reliance on Bitcoin blocks for transaction settlement. With the Nakamoto release, Stacks will be able to process transactions between Bitcoin blocks for a much faster chain that still benefits from finality on the Bitcoin main layer. The sBTC token is similar to Wrapped Bitcoin ( WBTC-USD ) as it would allow for Bitcoin-pegged DeFi activity on the Stacks blockchain. However, unlike WBTC, sBTC would not require a centralized custodian. Risks: Venture Capital Coin There is a fairly large amount of venture capital money behind Stacks which is sometimes frowned upon in certain cryptocurrency circles. Some of the Stacks backers include Digital Currency Group, the Winklevoss twins, and numerous others: Stackers Backers (CryptoRank) According to CryptoRank, Stacks has raised over $64 million between a seed round, additional funding round, private token sale, and ICO. And this estimate doesn't include the value of a strategic funding round that took place in July of 2019. Crunchbase has the estimate closer to $94 million in total VC funding. The point is, there is a non-zero percent VC dump risk in STX. I don't personally see alignment with larger players as a total net negative, but the possibility of being exit liquidity is always something to keep in mind when exploring these kinds of assets. VCs are very capable of getting it wrong. Just look at FTX ( FTT-USD ). Summary There is a notable block reward problem facing Bitcoin long term that likely needs to be solved one of two ways; either through a change to the network that enables new BTC issuance via block reward or through a large increase in the transaction fees that are paid to miners. The first option is likely a non-starter. Without an enormous increase in the price of BTC, the dollar denominated value of revenue from on-chain transactions would have to come from real network utility. This would mean BTC would have to be moved around not HODL'd. This is why there has been some growing acceptance of the idea that Bitcoin will likely need to welcome BTC fees paid from things like NFTs and DeFi to justify miner participation. I would say we're still a long way from knowing if Stacks is indeed the answer to Bitcoin's block reward problem, but it's an interesting idea nonetheless. Still, I wouldn't be chasing the idea at today's STX price. Like just about everything else in crypto, STX seems to be more of an idea at this juncture than a thriving ecosystem building on Bitcoin's network security. There's nothing wrong with taking a chance on an idea that has yet to manifest, but there is quite a bit of risk in doing that. I would probably avoid taking a chance on an idea after it has already rallied 400% in just a matter of a few weeks. STX is probably one to watch from the sidelines for a while.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ICO | STX,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ICO | TRADING | STX,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4583956-stacks-narrative-driving-hype?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/10188142.jpeg

Using the latest spot prices, $2.2 billion of total assets have been identified in the wallets of the accounts associated with FTX.com, of which only $694 million constitute the most liquid “Category A Assets” that include fiat, stablecoins, bitcoin or ether.  Other assets include $385 million of customer receivables, and significant claims against FTX sister company Alameda Research and related parties. The presentation also shows a $9.3 billion net borrowing by Alameda from the FTX.com wallets and accounts.  FTX US also showed a shortfall in assets, with $191 million of total assets located in the wallets of accounts associated with the exchange, as well as $28 million in customer receivables and $155 million of related party receivables. There is also $107 million net payable by FTX US to Alameda Research.  “The exchanges' assets were highly commingled, and their books and records are incomplete and, in many cases, totally absent,” wrote John J. Ray III, the CEO and chief restructuring officer of the FTX Debtors, in the press release. “For these reasons, it is important to emphasize that this information is still preliminary and subject to change.”  According to the presentation, FTX's team identified $7 billion in customer payables in cash and stablecoins, offset by $580 million in identified assets as of its petition date.

42421345,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnsc9,1677783528,Keep Crypto in America,"The Securities and Exchange Commission has been cracking down on crypto, setting off warning bells in the U.S. One fear is that regulatory uncertainty will push crypto industry players to avoid doing business in the country. There are some signs that this isn't mere alarmism.  Crypto lender Nexo announced late last year that it was leaving the U.S. after more than 18 months of “good-faith dialogue with U.S. state and federal regulators” came to a “dead end.” Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, told Bloomberg that the new companies that his firm is exploring are “not even bothering with the U.S..” Binance, which is the world's largest crypto exchange by trading volume, is reportedly looking to end some relationships with U.S. business partners and is taking another look at its U.S. venture-capital investments.  Emily Parker is CoinDesk's executive director of global content.  “I have been advising a number of projects to ‘bubble off’ the United States – don't sell tokens to U.S. users, don't allow U.S. users to access the site or take advantage of (all of) its functionality, don't market in the US, etc.,” Jason Gottlieb, partner and chairman of the digital-assets department at law firm Morrison Cohen LLP, told me.  “I can tell you from firsthand experience, as a crypto founder myself, every single lawyer we have met with has advised us against considering the U.S. due to the regulatory uncertainty,” Boyd Cohen, CEO and co-founder of video-game developer Iomob, recently wrote for CoinDesk.  “There is no jurisdiction in the U.S. that would make sense for us to consider,” concluded Cohen, who is an American himself.  It’s not clear if top regulators are concerned about this, but they should be. Because even if much of the crypto industry left the U.S., crypto won’t. According to a new survey of U.S. adults by crypto exchange Coinbase, 20% of Americans own crypto. Even if this number isn't completely accurate, it’s clear that crypto is something that U.S. regulators can’t ignore.  Read more: Jesse Hamilton - SEC’s Shadow Crypto Rule Taking Shape as Enforcement Cases Mount  As long as crypto continues to exist, ordinary Americans will find ways to buy and trade it, venture capitalists will invest in it, and entrepreneurs will build projects around it. If the U.S. can’t get its act together, domestic crypto projects will just operate in a gray area, and Americans will turn to offshore entities with potentially weaker safeguards. In other words, if the SEC is serious about U.S. investor protection, it would make more sense to keep crypto businesses at home.  Regulatory uncertainty  The problem isn't that the SEC is too strict; it’s that it’s too confusing. Crypto advocates have long argued that the SEC punishes select projects through regulation by enforcement instead of laying out clear rules and guidelines. As a result, bad actors can slip through the cracks while those who want to play by the rules don’t have a clear path to do so. It’s not just the SEC. Industry insiders have described the situation in Washington as a “crackdown” or “Operation Choke Point 2.0.”  There has been too much regulatory activity to sum up briefly here, but among the more controversial moves were a pending SEC lawsuit against Paxos on its BUSD stablecoin and its shutting down of crypto exchange Kraken’s staking program. The case of BUSD left many wondering why that stablecoin was targeted instead of others, and how exactly a stablecoin would be deemed a security.  As for Kraken, a big part of the problem was the SEC’s approach. In her dissent, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce wrote that it would have been better to have issued prior guidance on staking rather than communicating through an enforcement action. Pierce went as far as to suggest that the SEC was acting in the manner of “a paternalistic and lazy regulator.”  Given that the cryptocurrency industry is global in nature, projects have plenty of other options outside the United States. Countries that appear to be friendly or at least relatively clear on crypto are more likely to attract talent. Dubai has just unveiled a new crypto regulatory framework. Singapore’s relative clarity and crypto friendliness has long been a draw for Web3 projects. Now, we also have Hong Kong seeking to establish itself as a Web3 hub of Asia, if not the world. Japan is also embracing crypto.  Read more: David Z. Morris - Is the SEC Really the Bad Guy?  These developments give reason to believe that the next bull run might well come from Asia. At the same time, we are seeing crypto exchanges set up shop in Europe, which will soon have an extensive regulatory framework for crypto assets.  It’s worth noting that it isn't particularly easy to do crypto business in places like Hong Kong or Japan. Both have strict standards for crypto exchanges and the tokens listed on them. What these two jurisdictions offer are relative clarity on rules and expectations for projects that wish to operate there.  How do you even register, anyway?  The problem with the U.S. is that even projects that want to play by the rules find it difficult to do so, because the U.S. hasn’t quite decided how to regulate crypto. Shortly after the Kraken decision, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler stoked the flames of crypto Twitter by saying the following on CNBC: “Kraken knew how to register. Others know how to register, it’s just a form on our website. They can come in, talk to our talented people and disclosure review teams.”  That comment was swiftly mocked by Kraken co-founder and CEO Jesse Powell, who tweeted, “Wish I'd seen this video before paying a $30m fine and agreeing to permanently shut down the service in the U.S..”  In the absence of any rules or guidelines on stablecoins, how are issuers to know what crosses the line?  As my colleague Nik De reported, Gensler’s statement was undercut by another SEC official, who referred to a “whole process” in addition to the aforementioned website.  Others also took issue with Gensler’s comment, saying that crypto projects couldn’t register even if they wanted to. “Tons of projects (and their lawyers!) desperately *want* to come in and register. But when they do, they’re just told “no.’” Gottlieb of Morrison Cohen wrote on Twitter.  “There is simply no path to registration for many crypto products. The SEC says 'just register,' "" Gottlieb continued. “We say ‘cool but … as what?’ Because the regs just don’t fit. In response, we get blank stares, apologies, and mumbles that they’re not going to give us legal advice.”  Rebecca Rettig, chief policy officer of Polygon Labs, echoed that sentiment on Laura Shin’s ""Unchained"" podcast. If a company goes into the SEC to register, she said, the typical refrain is “we’re not sure what to register you as.” Even worse, “you may get a Wells Notice or a subpoena later from the enforcement arm of the SEC.”  This is a persistent problem. “I represented a crypto trading platform back in 2018 that wanted to get registered and in compliance, but the SEC and Finra (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) were not the least bit interested in that process,” Lisa Braganca, a former SEC enforcement branch chief, told me. “If that attitude has changed, it has changed only a small amount.”  Lack of guidance  Some of the SEC’s actions are more controversial than others. There probably won’t be many tears shed over the lawsuit against Terraform Labs founder and CEO Do Kwon, for example. But that one is too late. Do’s UST “stablecoin” imploded last year, causing billions of dollars to evaporate. Do has already escaped to Serbia or wherever he is now.  Meanwhile, as places like Hong Kong and Japan move forward with stablecoin regulations, U.S. lawmakers are still debating various bills. The SEC went after a stablecoin issued by Paxos, which was registered with the New York Department of Financial Services in an attempt to play by the rules.  In the absence of any rules or guidelines on stablecoins, how are issuers to know what crosses the line? Paul Grewal, chief legal counsel at crypto exchange Coinbase, recently said on ""Unchained,"": “This breaks my heart to say this as an American, I think any stablecoin issuer ought to first ask, whether or not the United States in this current climate is necessarily the best place in which to develop the project in the first instance.”  And therein lies the problem. Because stablecoins aren’t going to just disappear, they will just go somewhere else. We have already seen how the actions against BUSD appeared to benefit tether, an offshore stablecoin whose reserves and general opacity have sparked much concern.  Read more: Omid Malekan - Dollar Stablecoins Are Great for Users and the US Government  That is just one example of how a domestic U.S. crackdown is fueling an offshore player that U.S. regulators can’t control, even though that player still has implications for U.S. investors and the U.S. dollar.  Tether says “they’ve not done business in the United States, but they’re getting US dollar clearing from somewhere, right?” Custodia Bank founder and CEO Caitlin Long told us on CoinDesk TV.  “It’s the so-called euro dollar market – dollars that circulate offshore outside of the United States, outside of, frankly, the reach of U.S. bank regulators.”  Why the U.S. should care  Let’s be clear: Some in Washington would probably be thrilled if crypto just took off and left. That would be one less problem to worry about. Some enthusiasts will counter this with arguments along the lines of: The U.S. can’t afford to miss out on the crypto revolution and the next wave of financial innovation! But such claims aren't likely to convince lawmakers who see crypto as little more than a traveling casino.  It would be better to make a more practical argument about U.S. investor protection. And that is: If the U.S. fumbles the ball, the ball will get farther out of its reach. Crypto businesses will just go offshore, where U.S. regulators have less influence. And offshore crypto business can still do great damage to Americans. There’s probably no better example than the Bahamas-based crypto exchange FTX, whose implosion sparked bankruptcies in U.S.-based companies and major losses in U.S.-based venture-capitalist firms. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission alleged that FTX's demise affected commodity prices in the U.S.  The collapse of Singapore-based Terraform Labs also had a disastrous effect on some U.S. investors, such as a surgeon in Massachusetts who lost his nest egg on the failed project.  “People living in the U.S. want crypto,” Braganca told me. “If they can’t buy it here, they will use technology to hide their residency to buy it on foreign exchanges.”  There is so much more to be done in terms of establishing clear rules and guidance. Japan, for example, has a rule that exchanges must segregate customer and corporate assets. The regulation played a big role in ensuring that FTX Japan customers get their money back. The SEC has taken a first step by proposing new rules for qualified custodians in crypto. But the rule is still in a public comment phase, which means it’s far from becoming a reality.  A larger problem is that there is no federal regulator for U.S. crypto exchanges. One advantage of a jurisdiction like Japan is that there is only one regulator for the crypto industry: the Financial Services Agency. In the U.S., crypto is regulated by the various parties including the SEC and the CFTC, and crypto exchanges are mostly regulated at the state level. Sorting out this confusion would have to come from Congress, which could help define who regulates what.  In the more immediate term, it would be good for the U.S. to establish stablecoins rules, rather than going after individual issuers on an ad hoc basis. The SEC could be doing much more to outline guidelines and expectations, especially for the companies that walk through their front doors looking for direction.  Of course, the U.S. could have the clearest regulatory system in the world, and there would still be companies that intentionally set up overseas in order to evade scrutiny. But there will also be also customers who prefer the investor protections that come with safe and regulated exchanges. U.S. regulators should at least be working toward the goal of giving customers that option.  “There are also projects who are trying to follow the laws as well as they can, but because of the regulatory scrutiny, take pains to put themselves abroad, or even stay anonymous or pseudonymous,” Gottlieb said. “This is arguably worse for retail, because the projects are harder to reach if something goes wrong, and U.S. regulators have less affirmative authority over them.”  A U.S. crypto ban is extremely unlikely. Which means that if the U.S. continues its current approach, it will likely end up with crypto projects either operating overseas, or within gray areas inside the United States. Some of those projects will eventually be targeted by SEC enforcement actions, but it may be after some Americans already lost their life savings. Other companies in the gray zone may never be punished at all. Wouldn’t it be better to at least give people a chance to play by clearly defined rules?  “Sunlight is the best disinfectant,” Gottlieb said. “If the regulators don't let in some sun, everything will grow in the shadows.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | LUNA | REGULATION,Emily Parker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/03/02/lack-of-regulatory-clarity-puts-crypto-in-the-united-states-at-risk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7affb845c6c7350dfc99a0b86460d7fca6f81d58-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Crypto wallet company Giddy is sidestepping the need for Polygon users to hold that blockchain’s native MATIC tokens in order to pay for their transactions to go through. On Thursday, the Salt Lake City startup said its wallet users can pay for gas using the USDC stablecoin instead.  The new feature called “autogas” doesn’t actually eliminate MATIC from the equation; Polygon’s sidechain still requires gas payment in MATIC, just as the Ethereum network needs ether. But it does take the onus for sourcing that MATIC away from the end-user by making the swap between USDC and MATIC behind-the-scenes.  “As long the user holds USDC, GIDDY, or MATIC in their wallet, they can swap or send tokens with no additional cost or hassle,” CEO Eric Parker said. He said Giddy will not take a cut of these gas swaps.  Giddy’s new feature speaks to the fight among crypto wallets for a share of new users – the type of people who don’t necessarily have MATIC on hand. MetaMask is the market leader in the Ethereum ecosystem with tens of millions of monthly active users, while Giddy boasts 100,000 total signups.  On Wednesday, 0x unveiled a transaction relay API that allows Polygon and Ethereum wallet uses to pay without holding the respective native gas token. Robinhood Markets is already signed up for the API, highlighting the growing competition for friction-free payment experiences.  “Autogas will support even more tokens in the future,” Parker said.",POSITIVE,MATIC | USDC,ETH | MARKET | MATIC | ZRX | USDC,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/03/02/crypto-wallet-giddy-lets-polygon-users-pay-gas-fees-in-usdc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6805228237301576bb6c46939b074b78c73ab075-2048x1536.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414212,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB2vNc,1677781355,"NFT Trading Volumes Hit $2B in February, Highest Since LUNA Crash, Thanks to Blur","The war for market share in the non-fungible token (NFT) space may be having positive impacts after all.  According to Web3 data platform DappRadar’s latest industry report, NFT trading volumes reached $2 billion in February – the highest number since before the meteoric crash of Terra and its UST and LUNA tokens in May 2022.  Much of the surge is attributable to the rising popularity of zero-fee marketplace Blur. While NFT sales, the number of tokens traded, decreased about 32% from January, trading volume, the amount of cryptocurrency transacted across those trades, increased about 120%. Much of this has to do with incentivized trades ahead of Blur’s native token airdrop in mid-February.  Sara Gherghelas, blockchain research analyst at DappRadar, told CoinDesk that while Blur is overtaking market share and challenging the historically leading NFT marketplace OpenSea, the marketplace isn’t bringing new traders into NFTs. While OpenSea is targeted towards retail traders, Blur’s focus on professional traders may be raising trading volumes, not new buyers.  “Blur doesn't bring adoption,” said Gherghelas. “As of right now, they are just bringing hype with the token launch, but it's impressive what they're doing.”  Since Blur launched in October, it's been focusing on targeting floor-sweeping NFT traders looking to make large-scale purchases with zero fees. It quickly rose to popularity by incentivizing traders to transact on the platform to be eligible to receive its native token BLUR ahead of the token's release in February. Two days after the token went live, Blur surpassed OpenSea in trading volume, and since has been challenging the leading marketplace’s status.  The Yuga empire keeps NFTs hot  While Blur has played a large role in February’s NFT trading volumes, DappRadar has also reported that Yuga Labs’ NFT collections contributed 30% of Ethereum-based NFT trading volume last month. Its Dookey Dash skill-based mint played a large role in this figure – earlier this week, the winning key, an NFT earned by receiving the highest score on the game, sold for $1.6 million.  Gherghelas told CoinDesk that Yuga Labs customers don’t care about sought-after rarity traits in its NFTs, and that its dedicated customers will purchase whatever they release to become a part of the greater community the company is building.  She noted that Yuga buyers will be ready to embrace TwelveFold – its upcoming generative art Bitcoin NFT collection.  “It’s another way that they are trying to dominate the market,” said Gherghelas. “It’s surprising why Yuga Labs wanted to launch this … this might be something interesting that the market will evolve [towards].”  Leveling up Web3 gaming  The rush by Yuga Labs fans to jump into the sewer and play Dookey Dash wasn’t the only bullish sign for blockchain gaming, according to the report. While 2022 saw the decline of the play-to-earn model popularized by projects like Axie Infinity, in 2023 the Web3 gaming projects are focusing on the metaverse and being able to develop better projects, supported by gaming engines like Unity which released support for SDKs for MetaMask and other decentralized projects.",POSITIVE,LUNA,AXS | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING | AIRDROP,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/03/02/nft-trading-volumes-hit-2b-in-february-highest-since-luna-crash-thanks-to-blur,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c987abe7590ef1d291d3a33a144840a4be296f80-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421346,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnsb7,1677780241,Before Silvergate and After Silvergate,"Earlier this year, American Banker reported that two of the principal banks friendly to the U.S. crypto industry, Silvergate and Signature, took out loans from a federal program originally set up to back mortgage lending. This was a painful thing to learn in some corners of the crypto industry. They remember that when Satoshi Nakamoto released the codebase for Bitcoin in 2008 it was as much a political statement as a technical revolution. Before cryptocurrencies were even called “crypto currencies,” the understanding was this alternative financial system would play by predefined rules: No bailouts.  Of course, not everyone was upset to learn Silvergate, important for getting dollars into the crypto economy, took out this Federal Home Loan Bank. Banks are banks, after all. But few will be happy to hear that Silvergate looks set to fail – even if it seems karmic. Today, the bank announced it was delaying a Securities and Exchange Commission filing for the first time, after it made last-minute asset sales to repay an outstanding balance on its federal loan. The company lost $1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022 alone, a figure that may be revised higher, and still has additional loan repayment obligations – meaning it may soon be “less than well-capitalized,” a Silvergate filing said.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Betting when a company will fail is a notoriously difficult thing to do – often best left to professional investors. Even though Silvergate’s own projections are grim, the situation can change. It does not, however, bode well that companies including crypto exchange Coinbase are said to be switching banking partners to Silvergate’s primary competitor in the crypto industry, Signature. In January, one of the crypto industry's most visible and influential investors, Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood, shed 99% of her company’s Silvergate holdings from its disruption-focused investment fund. A majority of Silvergate’s shares are sold short, including a million-dollar-plus position taken out by billionaire trader George Soros’ hedge fund.  Silvergate’s problems come amid a regulatory backlash against crypto, one particularly interested in minimizing the risks of crypto contagion spilling into the traditional economy. Nic Carter, a CoinDesk columnist and venture capitalist, went as far as calling the situation “Operation Choke Point 2.0,” a reference to the secretive Obama era policy of pressuring banks against servicing legal, but perhaps morally dubious, industries. Indeed, on one January day alone four White House advisers published a letter advising banks against crypto exposure; the National Economic Council released similar guidance discouraging more financial institutions from dealing with crypto; the Federal Reserve denied crypto custodian Custodia’s banking application and separately issued a policy statement detailing the risks of banks holding crypto-related deposits – including stablecoin reserves.  See also: Senators Reportedly Push Crypto Bank Silvergate on Ties to FTX  I’ve already gone on the record to say crypto will still be here on the other side of the “chokepoint,” and the increased clarity will actually increase the number and quality of banking relationships for crypto firms. The industry isn’t going anywhere, and the bankers I know still see a sales opportunity. This doesn’t exactly say anything about Silvergate, especially not about the karma question: whether it’d be ultimately good for the industry for Silvergate to fail. The bank signed its first crypto customer (Barry Silbert’s SecondMarket, which eventually evolved into CoinDesk’s parent, Digital Currency Group) in 2014, at a time when crypto companies were finding it impossible to get or keep bank accounts. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried once described the situation as, “Life as a crypto firm can be divided up into before Silvergate and after Silvergate.”  That testimonial from Bankman-Fried, which has been removed from Silvergate’s website, may give insight into the bank’s unwinding. The U.S. Justice Department opened a probe into Silvergate to unravel if the bank committed or contributed to fraud at FTX and Alameda Research. The investigation is ongoing, but, as the crypto gadflies at Protos noted, it’s already known that FTX used to direct customers to wire payments to Alameda’s banking account at Silvergate. In a December open letter to the bank, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and others called that practice an “egregious failure of your bank’s responsibility to monitor for and report suspicious financial activity carried out by its clients.” That enough might be true.

But it’s tricky.  The Ethereum protocol is made up of two layers: the execution layer and consensus layer.  The reason this matters – in the context of what to call the Ethereum upgrade – is that it goes by different names on each layer. The execution layer will undergo the Shanghai upgrade, while on the consensus layer it’s known as “Capella.” So developers are cleverly referring to the whole thing as “Shapella.”  To understand what the two layers are, one needs to understand Ethereum prior to when it went through the last upgrade, the Merge.  Ethereum’s old proof-of-work blockchain was also known as the execution (application) layer. When Ethereum started its proof-of-stake (PoS) chain, also known as the consensus layer, developers were originally going to transition over to just the PoS chain. But that seemed to be too complicated of a task for developers, so they decided to merge the two chains together – hence the ""Merge.""  Now, the two layers have different functions that help move the Ethereum blockchain forward. The execution layer is where all smart contracts and protocol rules live, while the consensus layer is in charge of making sure that all validators on the network are following those rules.  The Ethereum Foundation did not come out with a specific blog that has rebranded the upgrade to Shapella, but over time, the core developers have started to call it Shapella.  On Twitter, Ethereum developers shared that Shapella went live on Sepolia earlier this week, referring to the two components of the upgrade.

In total, 13 Web3 games across the Ethereum, Solana and Polygon blockchains will be rolled out for free.  The games, developed by both traditional gaming studios and Web3-native creators, all use NFTs for in-game capabilities. Titles include the popular AAA first-person shooter game Shrapnel and gaming metaverse Planet Mojo.  “We’ve observed that many games entering Web3 do not necessarily need to use NFTs as a monetization tool. However, NFTs are a really important user engagement tool for them to share their vision and work with a highly captive and invested audience,"" said Chris Akhavan, chief gaming officer at Magic Eden.  To enhance engagement, Magic Eden will be posting a leaderboard of the top NFT traders across Mint Madness collections on its social media channels. The top 10 traders by volume on the Polygon collections will be entered into a prize pool of 20,000 MATIC (about $25,500), with the first place winner receiving a 4,500 MATIC (about $5,400) prize.  The NFT marketplace has signaled a growing interest in blockchain gaming.

The new product, Swing Platform, will be provided to developers during ETHDenver, a major conference for Ethereum developers, according to a press release. A key benefit is that developers can update configurations and deploy updates without changing the code.  Use cases for the product include propagating fast updates of cross-chain applications in “critical scenarios when it’s necessary to disable a particular token or bridge due to a security flaw,” the company said.  Applications that straddle multiple blockchains are becoming more common, though the cross-chain “bridges” often used to move digital assets back and forth between the different networks are frequently targeted by hackers. Chainalysis, a blockchain security firm, estimated the costs of hacks and other thefts from cross-chain bridges at $2 billion during just the first eight months of 2022.  The Swing Platform ostensibly could speed up the time to respond to a security incident – say if something happened outside of ordinary working hours, and nontechnical team members could act.  “Launching and maintaining a cross-chain application is generally fraught with risk and off-limits to all but the best-funded developer teams,” Swing founder Viveik Vivekananthan said in the press release. “Swing Platform drives down the barriers to creating a cross-chain dApp, freeing devs to focus on their core product without getting side-tracked by cross-chain configurations and app updates.”",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SPONSORED,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/03/02/cross-chain-protocol-swing-says-no-code-product-to-speed-up-app-deployment,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/607c1594cd3358d044602a63804f2bcb9c16cf4f-4310x2868.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42421360,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnsrd,1677776400,"Advisors: Learn Crypto, or Your Clients Will","The rise of cryptocurrencies over the past decade has been nothing short of remarkable, with bitcoin alone surpassing a market capitalization of over $1 trillion in 2021. Yet, despite this surge in popularity, many financial advisors remain hesitant or even dismissive towards cryptocurrencies. This has created a growing disconnect between advisors and their clients who have invested in these digital assets.  The reasons for this disconnect are numerous. Some advisors are skeptical of cryptocurrencies, viewing them as a speculative bubble or simply failing to understand their underlying technology. Others may be deterred by the lack of clear regulations or guidance from regulatory bodies. Whatever the reason, the result is the same: advisors are often ill-equipped to advise their clients who own crypto assets.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.  This disconnect can be especially problematic for clients who have invested heavily in cryptocurrencies without the guidance of a financial advisor. While some may have had tremendous success, others may be exposing themselves to unnecessary risks or missed opportunities. As such, it is crucial for advisors to become more informed and engaged with the world of cryptocurrencies to better serve their clients and help them make informed investment decisions.  The disconnect  The disconnect between financial advisors and their clients regarding cryptocurrencies has become increasingly apparent in recent years. The Bitwise/VettaFi 2023 Benchmark Survey of Financial Advisor Attitudes Toward Crypto Assets underscores this trend, revealing that only 37% of advisors admit to having personally invested in crypto, down 10% from 2022. In contrast, the same survey revealed that financial advisors say that upwards of 83% of clients either have crypto or the advisor isn’t aware if they do.  Furthermore, a recent survey by Coinbase of over 2,000 Americans in February 2023 found that 76% of Americans believe that cryptocurrency and blockchain are the future, while 20% of all Americans currently own crypto. Additionally, 67% of Americans think that the current financial system needs major changes or a complete overhaul. These statistics demonstrate the growing popularity and acceptance of cryptocurrencies among the general public.  Read more: What Fat Tails and Revolutionary Ages Mean for Digital Assets  Despite these trends, the Bitwise/VettaFi survey also showed that 76% of financial advisors in 2023 stated that they would definitely not or probably not invest their clients in crypto. This highlights the need for financial advisors to become more informed and engaged with these assets to better serve their clients and help them make informed investment decisions. As cryptocurrencies continue to gain mainstream acceptance and become more integrated into the financial landscape, advisors who remain disconnected from these assets may find themselves at a disadvantage. It is crucial for financial advisors to take these surveys seriously and adapt to the changing landscape of the financial industry.  A cautionary tale  As a financial advisor, I met with a client in late 2016-2017 for our normal annual review. At that time, I wasn't paying much attention to cryptocurrencies. However, during this meeting, my close client surprised me with news about his situation. It turned out that in 2015, he had become interested in Bitcoin and began investing in it without mentioning it to me.  Over the next few years, he had snowballed a $500 investment into a bitcoin mining facility netting himself an asset of around $500,000 in equipment and coins. As his advisor, I was caught off guard when he asked me what he should do with it and had no idea how to handle the situation. I realized then that if my client was exposed to potential estate, tax, security, liability and business issues, I had no idea how to help because I didn’t understand the technology that had just created this situation.  Read more: Introducing Our First Newsletter Course: Learn Crypto Investing  It was a wakeup call for me to take this emerging asset class more seriously and educate myself to better serve my clients. How could I be an advisor if I didn’t understand how to help? Being an advisor isn’t about understanding only the things you agree with, but understanding how to help any of your clients through a multitude of situations. This experience taught me the importance of staying informed and educated about emerging investment opportunities.  Avoid the mistake  There are a few ways that financial advisors can work to close the disconnect between them and their clients when it comes to cryptocurrencies and other emerging investment opportunities.  First, it is crucial for advisors to stay informed and educated about cryptocurrencies and their potential benefits and risks. This can involve attending seminars and webinars, reading up on the latest news and developments in the industry, and engaging with other professionals who are knowledgeable about cryptocurrencies.  Second, advisors can proactively reach out to their clients and have open and honest conversations about their interest in these technologies. By understanding their clients' interests and preferences, advisors can better tailor their recommendations and provide guidance on the best way to invest in cryptocurrencies.  Third, advisors can work to integrate cryptocurrencies into their overall investment strategies, in a way that is appropriate for each individual client. This can involve recommending specific cryptocurrencies or investment vehicles, as well as offering guidance on how to manage and store cryptocurrency assets securely.  Finally, advisors can partner with experts in the field of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, such as attorneys, accountants and other financial professionals, to provide comprehensive and well-informed advice to their clients. This can help ensure that clients have access to the full range of expertise and resources necessary to make informed investment decisions.

42410827,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggrtrd,1677775255,Bitcoin Miners Are Starting to Emerge From Brutal Crypto Winter,"The bitcoin mining industry appears to be getting back on its feet after a long crypto winter that saw major bankruptcies and fire sales.  Even though mining economics have improved only marginally as bitcoin trades above $20,000, capital is starting to flow into the sector once again.  “This shows that investor sentiment is still largely driven by BTC price action rather than mining fundamentals,” Ethan Vera, chief operating officer at Luxor Technologies, a crypto mining-services firm, said.  Meanwhile, lower energy costs in the last few months have also given miners some breathing room.  Read more: Bitcoin Miners Surface for Air as Sliding Natural Gas Price Provides Cost Relief  Shares of publicly traded bitcoin mining firms have outpaced bitcoin this year. A composite index of public mining rig manufacturers, foundries and miners compiled by Luxor is up by 52% so far this year, compared with bitcoin’s 44% rise.  In terms of percentage growth, the biggest winner in public markets has been Core Scientific (CORZQ), which is still traded over-the-counter amid its Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The value of its equity grew 693% in 2023, according to stock information platform TradingView, but the stock is still trading at about 30 cents. It is followed by Digihost, whose shares have risen 225%. Shares of Cipher Mining (CIFR), DMG Blockchain (DMGI), Bitfarms (BITF), Iris Energy (IREN) and Bit Digital (BTBT) have all at least doubled.  Meanwhile, when it comes to realized hashrate, a metric of miners’ competitiveness on the Bitcoin network, CleanSpark (CLSK) leads the pack, with 224% growth year over year, followed by Bit Digital (BTBT), Bitfarms and Riot Platforms (RIOT) following. Hashrate is a measure of computing power used to mine new bitcoin blocks and validate transactions on the network.  The earnings season that was kicked off by CleanSpark should reveal whether the rally in miners’ stock is justified.  The fourth quarter of 2022 was and could be the worst of the market cycle, according to investment bank H.C. Wainwright analyst Kevin Dede. He expects the upcoming earnings reports to show that the quarter was a trough one, making it the last step in the business cycle before a potential recovery.  The winners  With some major players out of the game, or in Core Scientific’s case on the bench, due to bankruptcy proceedings, opportunities abound for other companies.  Several publicly traded miners that were uncertain about their cash flow in the medium term, such as Greenidge Generation (GREE), TeraWulf (WULF) and Stronghold Digital Mining (SDIG), have been able to restructure their debt obligations in 2023 so that they can stay afloat.  Read more: Core Scientific Bankruptcy Approves $70M Financing Deal From B. Riley  Smaller firms are also seeing interest from investors in 2023. Sabre56 raised $35 million to build 150 megawatts of infrastructure, and mining machine supplier Minerset is preparing to merge with BlockQuarry, which also canceled $5 million in debt and raised $1.3 million in new capital.  Luxor’s Vera sees Hut 8 (HUT) and US Bitcoin Corp., which recently merged, as well as Galaxy Digital (GLXY.CA) as “positioning themselves to capitalize on the next bull run well.” He also noted that “a series of new startups are finding unique ways to build businesses in the space such as Block Green, Giga Energy and 360 Mining.”  Elsewhere, crypto lender NYDIG has access to more than 11.6 exahash per second of machines because of various loans that miners either restructured or defaulted on. If NYDIG were to bring all of those machines online, it would be a miner the size of Marathon Digital (MARA), one of the bigget publicly traded miners. The list of NYDIG’s borrowers includes Greenidge, Iris Energy, Core Scientific and Stronghold Digital Mining.  NYDIG declined to comment.  Don’t call it a comeback  Despite the rally in publicly traded miners’ stocks, the fundamentals are far from what investors saw back in the heady days of 2021.  “While that [the gains in the price of bitcoin] certainly gives some breathing room to struggling miners, it is still too soon to confidently be calling an industry rebound,” said Juri Bulovic, head of mining at Foundry Digital. Foundry is owned by CoinDesk’s parent company, Digital Currency Group.  The bitcoin network’s hashrate has grown by one-third since the start of 2023, with the difficulty of mining a bitcoin block reaching an all-time high of one in 43.05 trillion on Feb. 24. But when the network difficulty increases, miners’ profitability falls. The profitability of mining bitcoin, measured by Luxor’s hashprice, fell back to January levels when the difficulty increased on Feb. 24.  It's possible that miners might have found some relief this year, but with high inflation and interest rates still lurking in the background, miners are not out of the woods yet. The miners now have to implement risk-aversion strategies to survive the remainder of the down market.  Neil Galloway, COO of Rebel Mining, cautions that “we have a long way to go to get back to where we were” and so “it is crucial that miners remove additional risks” and “partner with a host who is financially solvent, owns and operates the underlying infrastructure and who has the systems in place to monitor and manage things appropriately.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/03/02/bitcoin-miners-are-starting-to-emerge-from-brutal-crypto-winter,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e70908467ca2c3b70f553dcbcd800b3a7e20aa8b-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The fund, Ninepoint Bitcoin ETF (BITC.CA), is traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and has about $21 million in assets under management, according to its website. It previously aimed to provide investors exposure to bitcoin, without having to buy the digital asset through a crypto exchange. With the price of bitcoin falling about 47% in last 12 months, Ninepoint is now proposing changing its strategy to diversify its holdings, according to a statement.  ""Ninepoint proposes changing the investment objectives of the Fund to be to seek to provide Unitholders with capital appreciation by investing in a diversified portfolio comprised primarily of equity and equity-related securities of companies that give investors exposure to emerging technologies such as Web3, the blockchain and digital asset-enabled internet,"" the statement said.  The ETF is up about 41% this year but has fallen roughly 45% in the last 12 months and is down 15% since inception, the website said. Another Canadian bitcoin fund, Purpose Bitcoin ETF (BTCC.CA) has also fallen about 50% in last 12 months.  This isn't the first ETF to get stung by the brutal crypto winter. Last year, Cosmos' bitcoin ETF, which was Australia's first such fund, said it would delist its Purpose Bitcoin Access ETF (CBTC) and Purpose Ethereum Access ETF (CPET) due to muted volumes.  Ninepoint's change is subject to the fund's unitholders vote, as well as approval from TSX and other regulators. If approved, the new investment strategy will become effective in May and will change its name to Ninepoint Web3 Innovators Fund with the ticker TKN, according to the statement.  ""Web3 is a new vision of the internet, incorporating concepts such as decentralization, digital assets and blockchain technologies,"" Ninepoint said. ""As with previous eras of the web, the companies that harness its potential could have an impact on every industry in the economy from finance to telecommunication, energy, media and beyond,"" it added.

The securities regulator said the $1.02 billion deal should be blocked because Voyager’s token could constitute an unregistered security.  “You come here and tell me … that I should stop everybody in their tracks because you might have an issue,” Wiles said, addressing counsel for the SEC. “It's kind of a weird objection.”  Wiles, who is with the Southern District Bankruptcy Court in New York, said he was ""absolutely shocked"" at the SEC's objection, saying it was asking Voyager to prove a negative with little guidance from the regulator.  “I get the feeling that this objection has been made as a kind of cover, so you can say later that we'll see we raised these issues,” he said. “You haven't really, you have done nothing … I need to know specifics.”  William Uptegrove, representing the SEC, said that creditors had not been sufficiently warned of regulatory risks, but declined to take a definitive position on whether VGX was a security.  Counsel for Voyager told the court that the deal could see creditors achieving 73% recovery, a revision upward thanks to the recently bullish crypto market. Court filings show that 97% of its customers, representing 98% of total claims, had voted in favor of the deal, though it has found less favor with regulators.

Users of Xapo Bank can now instantly pay for small purchases of up to $100 at any vendor accepting Lightning payments, without suffering high transaction fees and long blockchain confirmation waiting times, according to a press release.  The integration will also bridge the gap between traditional finance and crypto, which Xapo has been aiming to do. The Xapo Bank platform offers an annual interest rate of 4.1% on U.S. dollars in accounts, that are $100,000 deposit-guaranteed, and will soon be offering up to 1% on Bitcoin.  This is particularly important given the current regulatory pressure on crypto exchanges, yield-generating products and stablecoins. But it’s also about realizing a long-term plan to provide alternative banking possibilities in emerging market countries, explained Xapo CEO Seamus Rocca in an interview with CoinDesk.  Starting out with a wallet, cold-storage custody vault and reserve of 30,000 BTC back in 2013, Xapo later set up in Gibraltar under its virtual asset service provider framework. Sticking close to Bitcoin’s original ethos of financial freedom, Xapo took the decision to sell its institutional business to Coinbase in 2017 to focus on the retail space, Rocca said.  Since beginning the process in 2019, Xapo has been granted a banking license, obtained principal membership of Visa and Mastercard, as well as SWIFT membership. This means the firm can engage directly with correspondent banks, not via payment companies or third parties, and have access to money market accounts.  “We are now a fully fledged bank with a USD bank account, which we thought is most appealing to emerging markets,” Rocca said. “If you think about the U.S. and places like Europe, people are predominantly looking at crypto almost as a form of gambling. Whereas in places like Argentina, Venezuela, Lebanon, Nigeria, where currencies devalue and you can have hyperinflation, Bitcoin can change people’s lives.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | SPONSORED,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/03/02/xapo-bank-integrates-bitcoins-lightning-network-partners-with-lightspark,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/feca681352c28fb124f89a81bc8ed69e8dd01816-1384x753.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The crypto bank said it needed to delay the filing of its annual 10-K for 2022 and will take an additional two weeks to complete it.  JPMorgan also withdrew its $14 price target for Silvergate's shares, which fell 47% to $7.18 in premarket trading.  Silvergate’s rating was downgraded to “hold” from “buy” by Canaccord Genuity. The broker cut its price target on the stock to $9 from $25.  JPMorgan notes that in the recent quarter Silvergate realized a $886 million loss from selling underwater securities, resulting in the bank's tangible book value being cut by more than half to $12.93 a share.  “With the company having sold additional securities (beyond what was guided) as a loss in January/February, this reflects that the company is facing continued liquidity challenges,” JPMorgan analysts led by Steven Alexopoulos wrote.  The fallout from the collapse of FTX has shaken the crypto market, with Silvergate directly affected as the bank had around $1 billion of deposits from the now-defunct exchange at the time of collapse, the report said.  In addition, the past few months has been a back-and-forth between short sellers and the company, with Silvergate responding publicly on multiple occasions in an attempt to maintain its business, the report added.  “Short sellers appear to have contributed to a bank run of sorts with Silvergate reporting a much greater level of deposit outflows than anticipated in the fourth quarter and this likely continuing so far in 1Q23,” the note said.

The story was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.  According to the letter to Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, which was dated Wednesday, the group requested details of the company's balance sheets, internal procedures and any communications about alleged efforts by Zhao to limit compliance.  The letter, from Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Roger Marshall (R-Kansas) said that Binance and related entities ""have purposefully evaded regulators, moved assets to criminals and sanctions evaders and hidden basic financial information from its customers and the public,"" the Journal reported.  The exchange is reportedly bracing itself for significant fines for past conduct.  A Binance spokesperson told CoinDesk that the exchange ""always"" responds to queries from jurisdictions in which it operates, but suggested the accusations in the letter were false.  “A lot of misinformation has been spread about our company, and we look forward to correcting the record,” the spokesperson said, adding that Binance.com, the corporate entity, doesn't operate in or have customers in the U.S.  The company, however, conducts its U.S.-related business through its subsidiary Binance.US.  In response to the senators, the company “will provide information to help them better understand why we remain the most trusted platform with users across the globe,” the spokesperson added.

42414240,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB34i1,1677762000,"SkyBridge, Al Maskari Holding Partner With Blockchain Firm Casper Labs","SkyBridge Capital, the Anthony Scaramucci-led global investment firm, and the Al Maskari family's holding company said they will provide strategic support – including business development, investor relations and marketing services – to Casper Labs, a blockchain software company focused on enterprise and government.  SkyBridge Capital, which had ties to now-bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, is acquiring warrants to become a shareholder in Casper Labs, whose native CSPR token has dropped to to 4 cents from May 2021's all-time high of $1.33.  “Casper is pretty unique, because they’re providing an enterprise software decentralization model,” Scaramucci told CoinDesk in an interview. “We think that it’s not just for financial services, but could be used across the whole spectrum, including cloud computing.”  Casper Labs is adding big-name partners during a particularly harsh crypto winter, which saw venture capital and other investments in the industry drop 91% year on year in January, though the backing of infrastructure projects remained relatively strong.  Enterprise-grade technology  Casper Labs built a layer 1 blockchain that’s meant to scale to meet the operational needs of businesses and governments, providing transaction transparency that can help boost revenue at a relatively low cost.  “Every design decision we’ve made is for enterprise and government usage,” co-founder and CEO Mrinal Manohar told CoinDesk. “If you think about most blockchains, the way they’ve been built is to almost create a shadow economy in the sense that if an enterprise or a government wanted to use that technology, it would mandate almost a full teardown of their existing tech infrastructure.”  Manohar said Casper's blockchain can work with a company's existing tech stack. He also noted that Casper Labs also offers upgradeable smart contracts, which gives clients the ability to iron out bugs and make changes for the future.  Casper Labs is no stranger to headline-grabbing partnerships and is fresh off of an announcement with Google Cloud. The new partnerships bring useful connections, with Manohar noting that Scaramucci “has one of the most impressive Rolodexs out there.” The Al Maskari family has a deep network of contacts in the United Arab Emirates, a region that turned bullish on blockchain technology fairly early.  “If we get this right, people will start adapting this protocol – it will become an industry standard,” said Scaramucci.  Building during crypto winter  SkyBridge is still making investments in crypto technologies despite taking a hit from a market slump and the FTX collapse. The crypto exchange took a 30% equity stake in SkyBridge months before FTX’s liquidity problem was unveiled in a CoinDesk report and the exchange filed for bankruptcy. Scaramucci told CNBC earlier this year that SkyBridge can buy back FTX’s stake this year.  SkyBridge is starting to show signs of recovery, Scaramucci told CoinDesk, noting that the Opportunity Zone REIT fund has climbed more than 38% this year, and the core Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolio product has rallied 6%.  “We made a significant pivot in 2020. There’s some irony there because we looked like absolute geniuses at the end of 2021. And that was being lauded by clients, thanking us for pulling them into the future,” said Scaramucci. “And then, of course, by the end of 2022 we were being pilloried by the very same clients saying to us, ‘Oh my God, you guys don’t know what you’re doing.’”  “Neither of those things are true. We're not the geniuses that we looked like in 2021, and we're not the dunces that we looked like at the end of 2022. I think it's somewhere in the middle.”  Read more: Casper Labs Has Its Sights Set on Enterprise  UPDATE (March 2, 2023 13:46 UTC): Adds clarifying details to the seventh paragraph that Casper's blockchain works with a company's existing tech stack.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/03/02/skybridge-al-maskari-holding-partner-with-blockchain-firm-casper-labs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/81028e6d6f6cbd7443a266a052662d0b7457d36f-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The tokens exchanged hands at nearly $4,000 at writing time on Thursday, falling from Wednesday’s $24,000 level, CoinGecko data shows. The tokens ramped up trading volumes of over $22 million in the past day as selling pressure quickly gained steam.  Some on Crypto Twitter said the price drop was expected as Xmon inherently holds no value and were mainly bought up by traders in the past month for the SudoSwap lock drop.  As CoinDesk reported in January, SudoSwap airdropped its sudo (SUDO) tokens to early liquidity providers as well as holders of 0xmon NFTs, an NFT collection created by Sudoswap's founding team.  Developers said at the time that holders of Xmon, an Ethereum-based utility token of the 0xmons project, could lock up their tokens on Sudoswap to receive sudo tokens after one month. This mechanism came to be known as a lock drop.  That created a rush for Xmon tokens in mid-February when sudo initially become tradeable. Prices of xmon jumped from $19,000 to lifetime peaks of $43,000 in a single day as traders purchased the tokens, and then locked those for becoming eligible for the sudo lock drop.  Now, traders likely find little use for holding xmon as more sudo is rewarded. Developers have not released plans for Xmon utility – causing some in the Crypto Twitter community to liken xmon’s primary usage as “NFT collectibles.”",NEGATIVE,없음,MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/02/xmon-tokens-fall-80-after-end-of-sudoswap-lock-drop-program,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2e0b903fc25076d453a5a12c76d7235b6fb8200f-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

ArbiSwap’s native ARBI tokens fell from $1.50 to a fraction of a cent in the past 24 hours. Blockchain data shows the developers minted 1 billion fake tokens, swapping these for USD coin (USDC) and then for nearly 69 ether (ETH).  This was possible as the rogue developers controlled the project's liquidity pools. Liquidity pools refer to the token pairs held by smart contracts on decentralized exchanges, with developers initially seeding both sides of a token pair.  Blockchain data from DEXTools shows just $4 million in liquidity on ArbiSwap in European morning hours on Thursday. The service was launched in February and quickly grew to $4.4 million in total locked value (TVL).  ArbiSwap offered swapping of various cryptocurrencies for low fees on its platform and advertised giving back 100% of all generated revenue to holders of ARBI, which likely piqued the quick interest for ArbiSwap among users.  The move is a textbook rug pull, a scam carried out by developers who launch a working decentralized finance application and carry out social media marketing to popularize it before issuing a token and listing it on a decentralized exchange (DEX).  After investors have purchased the tokens in the hopes of a positive return, the developers shut up shop, remove liquidity and disappear.

42411038,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giB4YA,1677754794,Dubai’s Crypto Industry Welcomes New Licensing Regime Amid Global Regulatory Uncertainty,"Dubai's crypto industry is thrilled the jurisdiction has finally unveiled its crypto regulatory framework, giving locals a concrete licensing regime for digital asset issuers and service providers.  The framework comes after crypto markets went into a tailspin in 2022, prompting regulators everywhere to double down on setting up or enforcing safeguards, leaving companies and investors uncertain of crypto's future.  Under Dubai's new rules, all entities planning to offer one or more crypto-related services in the jurisdiction must seek the relevant authorization and licenses. The framework is accompanied by four compulsory rulebooks for service providers and seven activity-based rulebooks that set out requirements by the type of service offered – something Talal Tabbaa, founder of regional crypto exchange CoinMENA praised as being “elegantly designed.”  Dubai, one of seven emirates of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), is aiming to become a global hub for crypto and blockchain activity, and was courting companies to set up in the jurisdiction even before publishing its planned rules for the sector.  Since the new rules were published, institutional crypto custody provider Hex Trust became one of the first to get an operational go-ahead from the emirate’s watchdog, the Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA).  ""We were waiting for a licensing framework. We were waiting for somebody with interest to take the responsibility,"" said Mohamed Reda El Shiekh, head of compliance at Hex Trust for Middle East and North Africa (MENA), referring to the time before VARA, which was set up in 2022.  But Dubai’s new rules are a work in progress, its comprehensive nature leaving room for further development over time. The aspiring hub’s new legal framework also sheds light on compliance costs in the region – something that could make it harder for smaller companies to set up in the area.  While Tabbaa called the licensing costs “peanuts” when compared to other operating costs like hiring workers or maintaining offices locally, and compliance fees are not something crypto companies focus on when looking to enter a market, even he admitted some of Dubai’s fees can be considered to be on the expensive side.  According to the document, a company looking to offer exchange services must pay an application fee of 100,000 UAE dirham (US$27,200) and an annual supervision fee of double that amount. The application fee doesn’t guarantee approval and if the company wants to offer additional services like custody, lending or payments, they have to apply for additional licenses (at a 50% discount on application fees) and cover additional supervision fees.  For comparison, Abu Dhabi, another UAE emirate, charges $20,000 application fee and a $15,000 annual supervision fee. But that goes up if companies want to offer other types of assets, the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) said in an email to CoinDesk.  “Apart from any tokenized securities, under ADGM’s regulations, any crypto exchange that operates a spot or derivative market in relation to virtual assets (which include cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether) will have to apply for a Multilateral Trading Facility license,” the ADGM said. Regulations require a $125,000 application fee and a $60,000 annual supervision fee for companies seeking to open MTFs.  Over in Singapore, crypto exchanges that don’t engage with fiat currencies typically apply for a Major Payments Institution license (for digital payment token service), which comes with a 10,000 Singapore dollar ($7,500) annual fee. New York's BitLicense comes with a $5,000 application fee, but companies have reported bearing a cost of around $100,000 for time allocation, legal and compliance fees.  Dubai’s fees are reasonable for larger companies but may not be very sustainable for startups, Irina Heaver, a crypto lawyer based in the UAE, told CoinDesk.  “However, I fully agree that Dubai needed to step up and to regulate the space, with so many bottom feeding scammers trying to establish here, enough is enough. Hopefully, these regulations will be used to really target those bad players,” Heaver said.  In January, UAE Minister for Digital Economy Omar bin Sultan Al Olama faced tough questions about why Dubai comes up as a preferred destination for disgraced crypto founders like token issuer Terra’s Do Kwon. Al Olama said VARA’s regulations would be far from a “light touch.”  Not about the fees  The licensing fees may be on the high side in Dubai, but the grouping of Middle East and North Africa countries (known as MENA) is a lucrative market worth the price, Tabbaa said.  Mohammed AlKaff AlHashmi, co-founder of Dubai-based Islamic Coin, echoed Tabbaa, adding that “good projects” won’t have problems with high compliance costs, which could also help filter out “unwanted projects.”  “The fees are not the issue, one can raise money, earn or otherwise obtain the capital,” Heaver said, adding that, if not expensive, VARA’s regulations may be too prescriptive.  “Having read the regulations, although I understand the sentiment, and support it, I still believe that the regulations are overly prescriptive, to the point that it would make it hard for the supervisory personnel of VARA to supervise the compliance with their own regulations,” Heaver said.  Heaver said the requirement to obtain licenses by specific crypto activity might get in the way of enforcement. She, in turn, praised Switzerland’s principles-based regulations, which issues broad guidelines on how existing regulations apply to certain activities.  Switzerland does not have specific or separate rulebooks for crypto. In 2017 and 2018, the country’s financial regulator issued guidelines for how its banking, securities and anti-money laundering rules apply to the popular crypto fundraising method known as initial coin offerings (ICO).  Although Dubai’s framework can be considered “slightly” rules-based, it isn’t prescriptive, according to Kristi Swartz, partner at law firm DLA Piper, which was VARA’s exclusive global legal advisor in setting up the regulatory package.  “It's not something that's prescriptive, because you do need, in this industry, to be slightly flexible, insofar as it’s a fast-paced, fast-moving industry. So if you're very prescriptive in nature, you could probably expect it to be something that was out of date as soon as you wrote it,” Swartz said, adding that DLA Piper worked on the package for nine months, and had been tracking Dubai’s regulation of the sector even before formally engaging with VARA.  “As we look at the current regulatory landscape, it’s important to note that different jurisdictions and regulatory bodies can take different paths when addressing digital assets,” Alex Chehade, general manager at Binance Dubai said. “The main key aspects that these regulations provide for the Emirate are clarity and increased security for industry players, users, and investors.”  Binance obtained a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) license from VARA in September 2022, but Chehade says the exchange is only partway through the four-stage approval process. Under the conditions of the MVP license, all products and services can be provided only to qualified and/or institutional investors. Retail consumers “are strictly prohibited” until VARA decides to eventually approve a full operation license for companies, he added. No entity currently has a full license from VARA.  Stablecoins and tokenized assets  Despite its comprehensive approach, Dubai’s rulebook has room for more specificity. Heaver pointed out that the framework doesn’t uniquely address payments-focused crypto like stablecoins, which are tethered to the value of other assets. Regulators around the world, including the U.K. and the European Union – with its cross-jurisdictional crypto regulation framework MiCA – have so far focused largely on stablecoin regulation.  VARA does address stablecoins to a certain extent, Swartz said, just not in its rulebook for token issuance, but in the one for companies. In VARA’s companies rulebook, it lays out liquid asset reserve requirements for firms – including for virtual assets that are linked to the value of sovereign currencies.  The rulebook stipulates that, in all events, fiat-referenced virtual assets must be “backed by cash or cash equivalent… reserves denominated in the fiat currency referenced of not less than the market value of the Fiat-Referenced Virtual Asset in public circulation, or not yet redeemed.”  This reserve requirement aligns with that of other jurisdictions that are planning stablecoin regulations such as Hong Kong and Israel.  The rulebook for issuance, instead, focused on tokenized assets including non-fungible tokens (NFT), Swartz said.  VARA received inquiries on token issuance on a daily basis, said Winson Lau, fintech and digital asset lawyer at DLA Piper, who worked on the regulatory regime with Swartz.  “And those issuances range from … maybe just plain-vanilla NFTs, which are just digital artworks to maybe more complex projects such as tokenization of real estate, or tokenization of financial instruments,” Lau said, adding the issuance rulebook is designed to provide guidance to industry participants on how they can actually register and get regulatory sign-off on their projects.  “A big part of the rulebook is focused on what should go into the white paper which has to be registered with VARA and also publicly disclosed,” Lau said.  No privacy coins?  Under a section titled “Prohibited Virtual Assets,” VARA says the issuing of and all activities related to anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies are prohibited in the Emirate.  But it’s not a hard “no,” Binance’s Chehade said.  The rulebook includes a caveat for service providers that have “mitigating technologies or mechanisms to allow traceability or identification of ownership,” in place. VARA did not clarify what these exemptions might look like in practice, and Swartz declined to comment on enforcement specifics.  “If we want to list these and offer these coins we have to demonstrate that you CAN have some level of traceability,” Chehade said.  It’s unclear if user-activated traceability options available with privacy-enhancing crypto like Zcash would qualify under the rules as “mitigating technologies.”  “Although I understand the sentiment, I completely do not agree,” Heaver said of the move to prohibit privacy coins. “I am a big advocate for privacy, I believe that privacy is a human right.”  Read more: Dubai Mandates Licensing for Crypto Companies as It Sets Out Regulatory Requirements  Correction (Mar. 3, 2023 13:12 UTC): corrects Winson Lau's name in the third section.",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/02/dubais-crypto-industry-welcomes-new-licensing-regime-amid-global-regulatory-uncertainty,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6a17e326deedce3e0d48a6ed2c75eb53e2942f62-7952x5304.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

On Wednesday, BridgeTower Capital announced its turnkey on-ramp that connects financial institutions to Lido’s staking infrastructure and a security token that allows institutional investors to participate in layer 1 blockchain Avalanche’s staking rewards.  Through BridgeTower’s regulated marketplace, institutional investors can complete their know-your-customer (KYC) process, have a delegated, whitelisted wallet, stake their ether (ETH) straight into Lido’s system. BridgeTower’s integration with Lido’s ecosystem is fully automated and allows investors to take advantage of Lido’s staking infrastructure in ways that are consistent with regulatory standards.  The blockchain technology firm is also offering a security token, a new product that allows purchasers to receive rewards associated with Avalanche’s staked AVAX token. By collaborating with Securitize, a regulatory-compliant platform for issuing digital asset securities, BridgeTower is offering a security token that represents staked AVAX and sits on a regulated exchange.  When an institutional investor purchases a security token, BridgeTower delegates a wallet that receives Avalanche’s staking rewards to the institutional investor. “This is a way to get full access to a staked token through a security,” said Cory Pugh, CEO of BridgeTower Capital, in an interview with CoinDesk.  According to BridgeTower’s press release, “Rewards will be custodied on behalf of investors and, upon completion of the lock-up period, will be distributed to an investor wallet created by Circle.” Moreover, BridgeTower will use Chainlink’s Proof of Reserve service to monitor and verify the balance of an investor’s wallet and relay that information to their investment dashboard as on-chain proof.

42387990,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR02mp,1677725599,First Mover Asia: ConsenSys Chief Cryptoeconomist Sees Little Drama Ahead for Bitcoin,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin has been trading in the low $20,000s for weeks. ConsenSys Chief Cryptoeconomist Lex Sokolin doesn't see crypto prices shifting much in the near future.  Insights: Tron founder Justin Sun indicates that Hong Kong's developing strategy for digital asset licensing could lead to a change in attitude in mainland China.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,095 +13.2 ▲ 1.2% Bitcoin (BTC) $23,508 +228.4 ▲ 1.0% Ethereum (ETH) $1,650 +33.7 ▲ 2.1% S&P 500  3,951.39 −18.8 ▼ 0.5% Gold  $1,842 +4.0 ▲ 0.2% Nikkei 225  27,516.53 +71.0 ▲ 0.3% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Bitcoin's Undramatic Fate  Is bitcoin fated at least for the near term to the same narrow range it's occupied for much of this year, bobbing and weaving in the low $20,000s?  Lex Sokolin, chief cryptoeconomics officer for blockchain software technology firm ConsenSys, thinks so, with stickily high inflation at the root of its entrenchment. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $23,508, up 1% over the past 24 hours. BTC has risen about 40% this year and ether, the second largest crypto in market value, nearly as much, but their momentum has also stalled recently amid jobs and price data that have failed to head in the right direction.  ""I don't see any dramatic shift in market regime,"" Sokolin, who has contributed columns to CoinDesk, wrote in an email. ""We still have stubborn inflation and central banks are committed to raising rates until inflation cools further. That means that tech equities and crypto assets will continue trading at suppressed multiples, and the housing market is in danger. Consumers fewer assets for discretionary spending also limits participation in Web3 commerce, which can be looked at as fashion or luxury consumption.""  He added that ""institutions are waiting for further regulatory clarity, and the enforcement actions add to the uncertainty, although he also noted ""good news that many of the poorly structured actors of 2022 have been revealed and (that) the market"" was ""processing the consequences.""  Ether was recently changing hands at $1,650, up 2.1% from Tuesday, same time. Sokolin was upbeat about the upcoming Shanghai upgrade's longer-range impact. ""Withdrawals should significantly derisk staking activity in the Ethereum network,"" he said. ""Short term we may see some investors moving their positions, but longer term I would expect to see a higher portion of ether staked to secure the network.""  Other major cryptos were largely in the green, despite ongoing inflation- and economy-related angst, even as major equity indexes performed sluggishly. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto market performance, was up 1.8% for the day. The CMI gained just 0.8% in February, well off its January levels, according to its latest monthly report, although the Computing and DeFi sectors remained vibrant, gaining 17.5% and 11.1%, respectively. Computing has risen about 80% in 2023.  In an interview on CoinDeskTV, CoinDesk Indices Managing Director Jodie Gunzberg said interest in artifiial intelligence (AI) tokens had helped fuel Computingr's surge. ""I don't know that they're all AI tokens, but some of them certainly line up with the AI hype, the ChatGPT that's been dominating the conversation, we are seeing some pretty spectacular performance in Computing. So we are seeing a lot of those tokens dominate. And while computing doesn't make up a large portion of the market, in terms of market cap, there's still a ton of opportunity there.""

Justin Sun, founder of the Tron blockchain and the man who runs the Huobi crypto exchange, is ready for that change. He said in a tweet Monday that Huobi would apply for a virtual asset service provider (VASP) license in Hong Kong under new requirements to operate that go into effect in June. If approved, the exchange would then launch Huobi Hong Kong. ""Eventually, since Huobi is one of the leading blockchain exchanges in the region … I definitely [have] confidence Huobi will secure the license,"" he told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" on Wednesday.  Huobi, which ranks 15th in overall trading volume according to CoinMarketCap data, is one of the exchanges seeking a license to operate in Hong Kong's crypto market. Seychelles-based crypto exchange OKX, which ranks eighth in overall trading volume, has also applied to be licensed in the city. And then there's the looming presence of China.  ""Beijing sees Hong Kong as one of the experiment zones for cryptocurrency,"" Sun said.  The Chinese government's relationship with crypto has been tumultuous. Two years ago, regulators cracked down on crypto trading and mining.  Sun thinks China is looking at Hong Kong as a kind of experiment, to see if crypto can be regulated on the mainland. If Hong Kong suceeds it could create a change of attitude in Beijing. ""So that's why they want to see Hong Kong do it first,"" he said. ""And then you see the result. If it has positive feedback, they might change the policy in mainland China as well.""  The new requirements don't necessarily mean crypto will be available to Hong Kong retail traders, but at least for now Hong Kong's securities regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), has extended a lifeline to crypto companies.

42387992,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR030r,1677724520,Hosts of Bankless Podcast Raising $35M Crypto Venture Fund: Sources,"DENVER — The hosts of popular crypto podcast and newsletter Bankless are reportedly raising a $35 million venture capital fund to invest in seed-stage Web3 companies.  Show hosts David Hoffman and Ryan Sean Adams are to be general partners in the fund, said Ben Lakoff, also a GP. The trio comprise the fund’s investment committee, Lakoff told CoinDesk.  The fund, planned as a separate legal entity from the Bankless podcast, will nonetheless share its brand and likely enjoy the clout of one of the better-known content platforms in crypto media. One venture capital source told CoinDesk the combo of platform and investing arm would mean “incredible deal flow” for the nascent VC.  It’s the latest example of crypto media striking out into venture capital. Hoffman is on the ground at ETHDenver discussing the fund, another person told CoinDesk.  Founded in 2020 by Adams and Hoffman, Bankless has built an influential multimedia presence with its flagship podcast, newsletters, YouTube channel and its own decentralized autonomous organizatio (DAO), complete with a BANK governance token.  According to a preliminary website, the fund will focus on early-stage crypto companies and on “empowering pioneers to explore the frontier of Web3.”  The pair have also been outspoken supporters of Ethereum, decentralized finance (DeFi) and self-custody.  The move by Bankless into the venture capital sector appears to be a continuation of the brand’s foray into crypto investing that began last year. Bankless announced in November that it had acquired DeFi software project Earnifi under a newly created vertical called Bankless Labs.  “Bankless is going beyond media,” wrote Adams in a blog post at the time. “Now, we’re building tools for your DeFi journey.”  But according to Lakoff, Hoffman and Adams will put the kibosh on their private venture deals once the fund launches with capital from outside investors, at which point everything will run through the fund.  ""We've all been angel investing individually for years,"" Lakoff said, ""and now we’re putting all that time and energy into Bankless Ventures to accelerate the bankless movement and are able to bring along select LPs to participate.""",POSITIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,"Danny Nelson, Tracy Wang",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/03/02/hosts-of-bankless-podcast-raising-35m-crypto-venture-fund-sources,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/63a2539312ffd5b96df2cd5a8cafffc59d3f6668-5184x3888.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42387984,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR02PR,1677718507,Core Scientific Bankruptcy Approves $70M Financing Deal From B. Riley,"The federal judge overseeing bitcoin miner Core Scientific's (CORZ) Chapter 11 bankruptcy process approved a $70 million loan from B. Riley Commercial Capital that will help the company get back on its feet.  Judge David Jones of the Southern District of Texas also said during a hearing on Wednesday that he would agree to a group of stockholders' request to form an official committee to represent their interests in the case, pending a budget for the committee.  Core Scientific filed for bankruptcy in December, after months of a sustained crypto market downturn couple with high energy prices pounding its bottom line. As of the end of November, prior to the bankruptcy, Core Scientific's debts included $552.5 million of principal outstanding under senior secured convertible notes, $41.8 million to B. Riley, and $242.5 million under various equipment financing deals, according to a Feb. 27 filing.  The B. Riley facility, known as debtor-in-possession financing (DIP loan), replaces a previous interim order. It is meant to enable the company to reorganize and includes paying court and adviser fees. It comes with a 10% annual interest rate and has ""super priority"" over all administrative expenses and unsecured claims, except for some fees known as a carve-out, according to a term sheet filed with the court.  Another hearing will take place on Friday to discuss the appointment of the stockholders' committee. A final budget for the DIP financing will also have to be agreed upon.  B. Riley Commercial Capital is a subsidiary of B. Riley Financial (RILY).  Equipment lender BlockFi had objected to the DIP, saying it didn't offer adequate protections for its collateral, but the issue was resolved prior to the Wednesday hearing.  Read more: Bitcoin Miner Core Scientific to Borrow $70M From B. Riley  Core Scientific Senior Vice President of Capital Markets and Acquisitions Michael Bros said in a Dec. 21 filing that the equipment loans such as BlockFi's are undersecured, with as much as $90 million in collateral.  The stockholders' claims  On Feb. 3, a group of equity holders asked the court to form an official committee they claimed would provide “critical input with respect to valuation and negotiating Chapter 11 plan terms on behalf of equity.” The group said that Core Scientific is solvent, and that given the recent rally in bitcoin prices and the improvement of energy markets, “the value available for equity is increasing.”  In its response, Core Scientific agreed that it is “not hopelessly insolvent,” considering recent market movements, and supported the motion, setting a budget of $4.75 million, including financial advisors’ fees, to be taken from the secured assets in what is known as a carveout.  Despite his agreement to forming the committee, the judge said he will ""reserve the benefit"" of ""hindsight."" If he decides that the interests of the equity holders weren't advanced by the committee, or it was done at the expense of other creditors, he might use ""a number of tools,"" including bringing the committee's budget down to zero.  The equity group represents 69 million shares of common stock. That’s less than the issued and outstanding common stock owned by company insiders, which is about 29% of the total at 107 million, according to the office of the U.S. Trustee.  B. Riley previously argued that weeks of negotiations on the financing should not be upended by the last minute request of $4.75 million from the carveout.  The equity holders also question whether Core Scientific was protecting their fiduciary duties during negotiations because it did not adequately shop around for financing options. The equity holders “successfully encouraged” a third party to submit an alternative to B. Riley’s financing proposal, which they believe was the only competing offer on the table.  “Had the Ad Hoc Equity Group been involved from the outset, the Debtors might well have avoided the original agreement with the secured convertible noteholders that allowed for a $6 million termination fee, equating to an internal rate of return in excess of 500%,” the group said.  In its response, Core Scientific rejected these claims as ad hominem attacks and said it spoke to 20 possible lenders for the original financing proposal.

42387986,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR02Yn,1677718335,Bitcoin Holds Strong Over $23.6K to Continue Recent Consolidation,"Bitcoin edged toward $24,000 early Wednesday, dropped but then rebounded to hold strong above $23,600.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading at press time at about $23,663, up 2.3% over the past 24 hours.  Bitcoin (BTC)’s failure to regain the $25,000 threshold it surpassed in mid-February and recent consolidation “could be a sign of weakness, at least in the short term,” Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in a Wednesday note.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, recently jumped by more than 4% to recently trade around $1,665. The CoinDesk Market Index that measures crypto market performance was up around 2.9% for the day.  Decentralized finance (DeFi) lending and borrowing platform Maker’s native MKR token saw a nearly 19% surge over the past 24 hours. Data from Coinglass showed that traders who bet on price shifts liquidated more than $444,000 of MKR short positions in the past 24 hours. That was more than 16 times the $27,000 of MKR long positions that investors liquidated over the same period. These types of short squeezes have historically tended to accelerate price jumps.  In a tweet last week, blockchain analytics firm Santiment noted the largest whale moves involving MKR in three months with more than 24,000 of the tokens worth around $17.4 million at the time “moved to a whale address” and a subsequent identically sized move. Santiment viewed the moves as bullish.  “On downswings, massive moves like this are often correlated with turnarounds,"" Santiment wrote.  Meanwhile, traditional markets were mixed on Wednesday as the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 0.4% and 0.6%, respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was up 0.02%.  In the aftermath of several disappointing indicators suggesting that inflation remains problematic, investors increasingly expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to continue raising interest rates in upcoming months, although a fourth consecutive monthly contraction in the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing PMI data offered some evidence of an economic slowdown.  Macroeconomic concerns pushed the 10-year Treasury yield to over 4% Wednesday – the first time since November.  “We want prices to rise at a much slower rate than they are now, so disinflation will need to occur for that to happen,” Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at brokerage firm Interactive Brokers, wrote in a Wednesday note, referencing Fed Chair Jerome Powell's repeated use the term of “disinflation” in February.  “We should all welcome the time when disinflation becomes a lasting feature of our economy,” Sosnick continued. “But for now, the disinflation that we might have seen late last year appears to have been transitory.”",NEUTRAL,BTC | MKR,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MKR | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/02/bitcoin-holds-strong-over-236k-to-continue-recent-consolidation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3be8092c85b37b8212188b1f359ccdc437fbf905-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
