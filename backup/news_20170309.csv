42379289,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX85GhF,1489095276,From First Filing to Final Decision: The Journey of the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF,"It’s a looming decision that has sparked global headlines, turned the heads of financial analysts and kept the bitcoin world on the edge of its proverbial seat.  This refers, of course, to the bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposed by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. That ETF – first proposed in mid-2013 and subject to a range of public comments and exchange switches – is effectively waiting in the wings for a decision by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which is weighing a rule change proposal that would clear its passage.  While most in the digital currency space likely know the ins-and-outs of the ETF story, those not so familiar with it might not understand all the details. In this feature, CoinDesk explores the journey - from start to near-finish – of the proposed bitcoin ETF.  In the beginning  Before getting into the story of the bitcoin ETF’s early days, it might help to understand who Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss are exactly.  Both graduates from Harvard University, the two took part in the 2008 Beijing Olympics in the men’s rowing competition, where they advanced to the finals and ultimately scored sixth place, according to ESPN.  Another major event in their pre-bitcoin days was the now-infamous legal battle with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, documented in the 2010 film The Social Network. While at Harvard, the Winklevosses conceived a social network, ultimately dubbed ConnectU, for which they began working with Zuckerberg. Yet Zuckerberg soon opened the well-known Facebook platform, sparking the legal fight that resulted in a $65m settlement.  Yet it was their bet on bitcoin – which they revealed in early 2013 – that set them on the course toward this week’s SEC decision. Amassing a considerable amount of coins, the two perhaps represented an early voice of confidence in the digital currency among mainstream investors.  Several months later, their first S-1 was filed with the SEC, formally registering their intention to launch an ETF tied to bitcoin.  Road to the ETF  It was in that initial filing that the fundamental argument for the ETF’s existence was first put forward. Simply put, the product was pitched as a way for more seasoned investors to gain exposure to bitcoin without having to purchase and hold the digital currency.  As explained in the filing:  “The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the Blended Bitcoin Price of Bitcoins, less the expenses of the Trust’s operations. The Shares are designed for investors seeking a cost-effective and convenient means to gain exposure to Bitcoins with minimal credit risk.”  Then, like many other things in the bitcoin space, the collapse of Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt Gox triggered a small but meaningful change in how the ETF would be constructed. Mt Gox was once the world’s most voluminous bitcoin exchange before it fell apart amid accusations of fraud, leading to the eventual arrest of its CEO last year.  In the aftermath of the Gox failure, an amendment was filed to the ETF’s S-1 which changed the price index which the ETF would use to determine the price of a bitcoin. The proprietary Winkdex was adopted, replacing the old model based on weighted average prices of several bitcoin exchanges.  The duo confirmed, in a follow-up filing in 2014, their initial intention to list the ETF on the NASDAQ OMX exchange. The ticker symbol “COIN” – a tip of the hat to the digital currency – was first disclosed at this time.  That filing also added new risk factors related to the ETF, including the potential for a so-called 51% mining attack on the bitcoin network.  Watch and wait  That submission would prove to be yet another leg in a long waiting game for the Winklevoss-backed ETF. During that time, the Winklevosses were approved for a bank charter, setting the stage for the launch of Gemini, their digital currency exchange.  Last year, in a summer defined by the Bitfinex exchange hack and the collapse of the DAO, the ethereum-based project funding vehicle, the calculus for the Winklevoss ETF shifted significantly.  A new filing in June revealed a plan to debut the product on the Bats BZX Exchange. The scope of the offering also expanded, from an initial $20m to $65m. That request led to further delays last fall, triggering a call from the SEC in October for more public comment, seeking more input from both stakeholders and critics of the idea.  The SEC went to further delay the decision process in January of this year, setting the stage for this week’s deadline.  Since then, however, the scope of the proposed ETF offering has expanded further, growing from $65m to $100m, while also lowering the maximum offering per share price from from $65 to $10. A February filing detailing the changes also included language about the risks of a network hard fork and contingency plans should two blockchains sharing bitcoin’s transaction history emerge.  The final countdown  Those developments take us to the present day, during which market observers, stakeholders, bitcoin enthusiasts and potential investors are watching the skies for the SEC’s word.  That determination is set to be revealed by tomorrow, according to a source with knowledge of the agency’s work, yet at press time, the SEC has kept mum about its decision.  In the meantime, bitcoin traders are gearing up for a possible increase in volume – and volatility – when markets react one way or another, and at least one hedge fund that invests in bitcoin has moved to reduce its exposure to the market.  But until the decision is made, all eyes are on the SEC.

42407165,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAfF1Q7,1489091665,What Can a Blockchain Do?,"Financial institutions have financed the disruption of countless industries over the last 30 years; they have an idea of what a revolutionary technology can do to static incumbents.      So, to stay ahead of change, banks have been proactive in setting up R&D labs, building test centers and establishing partnerships with blockchain developers to fully understand the revolutionary potential of the technology.      Financial institutions were the first to dip their feet in, but academia, governments and consulting firms have also studied the technology.      All of this work is, of course, in addition to what the entrepreneurs and developers are doing, either by finding new ways to use the bitcoin or ethereum blockchains, or else creating entirely new blockchains.      This has been going on for over three years now, and the results are starting to come in.      While some of the waters are still murky, this is what we know a blockchain can do:    Establish digital identity    As discussed in our guide ""How Does Blockchain Technology Work?"", the identity component of blockchain technology is fulfilled through the use of cryptographic keys. Combining a public and private key creates a strong digital identity reference based on possession.      A public key is how you are identified in the crowd (like an email address), a private key is how you express consent to digital interactions. Cryptography is an important force behind the blockchain revolution.      As stated in our guide ""What is a Distributed Ledger?"", blockchains are an innovation in information registration and distribution. They are good for recording both static data (a registry) or dynamic data (transactions), making it an evolution in systems of record.      In the case of a registry, data can be stored on blockchains in any combination of three ways:    Unencrypted data – can be read by every blockchain participant in the blockchain and is fully transparent.  Encrypted data –can be read by participants with a decryption key. The key provides access to the data on the blockchain and can prove who added the data and when it was added.  Hashed data – can be presented alongside the function that created it to show the data wasn’t tampered with.    Blockchain hashes are generally done in combination with the original data stored off-chain. Digital ‘fingerprints’, for example, are often hashed into the blockchain, while the main body of information can be stored offline.      Such a shared system of record can change the way disparate organizations work together.            Currently, with data siloed in private servers, there is an enormous cost for inter-company transactions involving processes, procedures and cross-checking of records.      Read more on this in our guide ""What are the Applications and Use Cases of Blockchains?"".    Prove immutability    A feature of a blockchain database is that is has a history of itself. Because of this, they are often called immutable. In other words, it would be a huge effort to change an entry in the database, because it would require changing all of the data that comes afterwards, on every single node. In this way, it is more a system of record than a database.      Read more on this in our guide ""What is the Difference Between a Blockchain and a Database?"".    Serve as a platform    Cryptocurrencies were the first platform developed using blockchain technology. Now, people have moved from the idea of a platform to exchange cryptocurrencies to a platform for smart contracts.      The term 'smart contracts' has become somewhat of a catch-all phrase, but the idea can actually be divided into several categories:      There are the 'vending machine' smart contracts coined in the 1990s by Nick Szabo. This is where machines engage after receiving an external input (a cryptocurrency), or else send a signal that triggers a blockchain activity.      There are also smart legal contracts, or Ricardian contracts. Much of this application is based on the idea that a contract is a meeting of the minds, and that it is the result of whatever the consenting parties to the contract agree to. So, a contract can be a mix of a verbal agreement, a written agreement, and now also some of the useful aspects of blockchains like timestamps, tokens, auditing, document coordination or business logic.      Finally, there are the ethereum smart contracts. These are programs which control blockchain assets, executed over interactions on the ethereum blockchain. Ethereum itself is a platform for smart contract code.      Blockchains are not built from a new technology. They are built from a unique orchestration of three existing technologies.

42379291,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX85Gjl,1489085542,Ontario Securities Regulator Issues Warning About ICOs,"Ontario's securities market watchdog has issued a warning to businesses using blockchain: you may run afoul of our laws.  In statements  , the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) said on 8th March that the province's laws may apply in some cases, advising companies that use or are looking to utilize the tech to get in touch with the regulator if they have any doubts.  The OSC made specific references to initial coin offerings, or ICOs, through which companies or individuals can issue and sell blockchain-based tokens in order to fund or bootstrap a new project. The model's supporters say that it represents a wholly new mechanism for entrepreneurs to access capital, while critics argue that it fuels excessive speculation and fraudulent behavior.  According to the OSC, an ICO could fall under its jurisdiction even if the tokens themselves don't signify an ownership stake in a particular business.  The agency said:  ""Products or other assets that are tracked and traded as part of a distributed ledger may be securities, even if they do not represent shares of a company or ownership of an entity. Businesses' specific use of [distributed ledger technology] may trigger Ontario securities law requirements, including the need to be registered or file a prospectus.""  The OSC said that it plans to engage in more dialogue with industry stakeholders in order to prevent businesses from unknowingly violating its statutes.  ""Because this is a novel area, businesses may not be aware that some uses of this technology could trigger securities law requirements. We encourage these businesses to speak with us about securities law and investor protection requirements that may apply,"" said Pat Chaukos, chief of OSC LaunchPad, the agency's fintech-focused outfit.  The warning closely follows an OSC-hosted hackathon at which a number of blockchain-focused startups developed concepts based around the concept of regulatory technology. Notably, one of the top-placing startups developed a solution for categorizing information related to ICOS through which regulators can obtain data.

42379295,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX85GnX,1489076469,New Hampshire's Bitcoin MSB Exemption Clears First Vote,"Lawmakers in New Hampshire have advanced a proposed law that would exempt bitcoin traders in the state from money transmitter requirements.  The bill, HB 436, was passed in the New Hampshire House of Representatives yesterday by a vote of 185-170. With the passage, the measure now moves to the state Senate for further consideration. Public records currently do not indicate when the New Hampshire Senate will take up the bill.  Specifically, HB 436 seeks to exempt virtual currency users from having to register as money service businesses, while also creating a formal definition for ""virtual currency"" under state law.  According to a draft text of the bill, the exemption applies to ""persons conducting business using transactions conducted in whole or in part in virtual currency"".  The bill was sponsored by Rep. Barbara Biggie, a former Western Union employee, and co-sponsored Rep. Keith Ammon, a bitcoin early adopter and libertarian activist in New Hampshire. The bill was first introduced in January, moving out of the House Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee on 16th February.  HB 436 stands in contrast with New York’s BitLicense, formalized in 2015, which added new compliance layers under the state's financial regulations for businesses dealing in digital currencies.  The bill's advancement is the latest sign that state legislatures around the US are moving quickly on new laws related to the tech.  Just this week, lawmakers in Maine put forward a proposal to create a commission that would study the veracity of blockchain-based elections. The goal, according to the measure filed, is to see whether the tech can improve transparency while also aiding the accuracy of paper-based votes.

42379272,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX82ar5,1489071698,Singapore's Central Bank Completes Digital Currency Trial,"Singapore’s central bank has completed a distributed ledger trial focused on inter-bank payments, officials said today.  The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced the test in November, working with the R3 banking consortium and a group of member banks that is said to include the Development Bank of Singapore, HSBC, Bank of America and JPMorgan, among others. According to the bank, the aim was to develop ""a digital representation of the Singapore dollar for interbank settlement"".  MAS officials said that a more comprehensive report on the test would be forthcoming, though it didn’t provide an exact release date.  According to the central bank, further tests are planned that will utilize the tech and lessons gleaned from the first test.  The MAS said:  ""MAS has plans for two spin-off projects that will leverage the lessons of the inter-bank payments project. The first project, driven by the Singapore Exchange (SGX), focuses on making the fixed income securities trading and settlement cycle more efficient through DLT. The second project focuses on new methods to conduct cross border payments using central bank digital currency.""  As part of that second planned test, the MAS said that discussions are already under way to connect Singapore’s payment system with ""other countries"", utilizing the tech to manage those transactions.  Notably, Sopnendu Mohanty, chief fintech officer for the MAS, said that the work between the institution and several of the banks has already spawned other iterations of the inter-bank trial.  ""Already, some institutions have embarked on projects that are inspired by this collaboration. We look forward to the next phases of our project which will develop trial applications for securities settlement and cross border payments,"" he said.

42379268,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX82am3,1489068908,Bitcoin Mining Pool Backs Rootstock Smart Contracts Effort,"As the community of blockchain developers around the world pushes ever deeper into smart contracts, bitcoin is being left behind.  Even as the cryptocurrency on the bitcoin blockchain continues to hover around record highs, the diversity of applications being built on top of the distributed ledger of transactions plateaued years ago.  But one company is helping lead the charge to give bitcoin developers the ability to write sophisticated self-executing lines of code on top of what is widely considered the most secure blockchain.  Announced today, Argentina-based RSK (also known as Rootstock) has completed the first complete transition of a bitcoin exchange to a process called 'merge-mining' of its test network.  Since last week, every single miner on the Bitcoin India mining pool as been earning what RSK calls 'smart bitcoins' along with their share of the pool's bitcoin rewards.  Similar to how the ethereum network is fueled by the ether cryptocurrency, the smart bitcoins mined through RSK would power the startup's smart contract ecosystem.  RSK’s new business development manager, Henry Sraigman says the transition of bitcoin miners to the RSK merge-mining is designed to give the resilient bitcoin ecosystem increased opportunity for creativity.  Sraigman said:  ""We decided not to mint a new coin, but as bitcoin was the most robust cryptocurrency out there we decided to connect the smart contract capabilities with the bitcoin blockchain.""  Bitcoin India began the process of switching over to RSK merge-mining last March, during the exploratory phase of the testnet. By November, its pool, which also mines litecoin and ethereum, had begun the merge-mining process on RSK’s testnet and the bitcoin mainnet concurrently.  Instead of a full switch to merge-mining, Bitcoin India started with only 1 petahash of its total hashing power, and ""progressively increased"" to the 11 petashashes currently being deployed, according to the firm's co-founder, Yoshi Goto.  ""After the startup phase,"" Goto told CoinDesk, ""the merge-mining process has been working with no downtime for the last months and we can expect the hashing power to keep rising.""  Getting smart  Increasingly, the number of developers building on a blockchain is being portrayed as an asset to the wide variety of industries interested in building non-cryptocurrency applications on a blockchain.  While the bitcoin developer community is widely regarded as one of the largest, the lack of sophisticated smart contract abilities has limited growth, according to Sraigman.  So instead of mining a new coin to compete with the likes of ethereum, or launching a distributed ledger without a currency as have other competitors in the space, Sraigman says RSK wanted to build a tech solution that would allow give bitcoin developers more sophisticated tools.  To that end, the firm last year raised a $1m seed round and gathered 25 bitcoin startups included Bitfinex, BitPay, Bitstamp, BTCC and Xapo to commit to helping develop bitcoin smart contracts via its sidechain solution.  According to Sraigman, RSK is currently “on-boarding” mining pools around the world and teaching them how to integrate merge-mining.  Overcoming skeptics  In spite of some concern that the RSK blockchain might compromise anonymity, Sraigman expects the company will have 50% of global bitcoin miners switched over to 100% merge-mining in the coming months.  If the testnet switches over to a live network in May, as planned, merge-mining is expected to give miners on the bitcoin network access to a new source of revenue with no added mining power demands.  Sraigman concluded:  ""When we started with this idea, what we decided was to onboard people providing security to bitcoin and to give them a new revenue stream. Because now they can participate in this smart contract revolution.""  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in RSK.

42379273,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX82akn,1489064533,A Public-Private Ethereum? It Won't Be As Easy As It Sounds,"Many ethereum developers have high hopes that the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, backed by the likes of JPMorgan and Microsoft, will help to join private blockchains tailored toward the corporate world with the larger ethereum network.  Launched in Brooklyn last week, the group aims to provide the tools to make ethereum, which currently faces scalability and privacy challenges, more usable for companies.  But, one vision is that it will do more than that – like help to spur larger scale adoption of ethereum.  While ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin argued at the launch event that developers of enterprise blockchains and developers of the larger ethereum network should work together to solve shared problems, ConsenSys chief of staff Jeremy Millar argued in the opening speech that it will one day be possible to connect the two types at a more technical level.  He offered an analogy:  “We talk about ‘the internet’ as if it’s one thing. It’s not one thing. The internet is a network of networks. That is how the internet is built. That’s important to note in the context of private and public networks.""  The latest reminder of this effort comes from a newly released paper, ""Ethereum Enterprise Vision,"" which outlines a variety of technical goals for the alliance, especially over the next year.  The paper is no means a final plan, and, admittedly, it might be a bit early to hypothesize about the long-term trajectory of a week-old consortium.  Still, against a backdrop of murmurings about how the consortium could help bridge the private and public blockchain worlds, it's notable that making private ethereum implementations compatible with the larger public blockchain pops up repeatedly as one of the technical objectives.  Hitting resistance  However, focusing on the technical requirements to help make that happen is not a necessarily a priority for all members of the consortium.  At least one member company, Monax, hopes to see a roadmap more focused on standardizing the tools needed by private versions of ethereum.  In this case, that means focusing on the ethereum virtual machine (EVM), the piece of ethereum responsible for executing smart contracts, rather than building out the other components necessary to make private blockchains compatible with the public blockchain.  ""Basically, private chains are totally different animals than public chains and we think that trying to track the public chain ecosystem is inappropriate for a consortium whose first business will be to adopt standards for private chain use cases,"" Monax Industries COO Preston Byrne told CoinDesk.  He added that, in his opinion, being expected to build their technology around a spec that needs to meet the needs of the public blockchain would be ""regressive and impair performance of our software"".  Monax, a private blockchain provider, has been experimenting with using the EVM in a private setting, going as far as to propose a codebase featuring the technology to the Linux-led Hyperledger consortium.  Byrne expects that other companies will agree. He said:  ""As we actually maintain a popular ethereum client, our suspicion is that corporate users will wind up agreeing with us that line-for-line copies of the public chain ecosystem are not required for their use cases.""  Building bridges  Even if it isn't winning everyone over, it's an idea that has attracted quite a bit of attention, especially at the alliance's launch event.  So, how would the idea play out at a technical level?  Each implementation, public or private, uses a different 'consensus algorithm', or a way for the network to come to agreement on the transaction history.  The trouble is making such disparate networks interoperable, so as to switch from one algorithm to another, say, if you want to send money to another network.  There’s one technical idea called 'pluggable consensus', mentioned many times throughout the conference, that might help form such a bridge.  ""Pluggable consensus is the idea that you can swap out your consensus algorithm based on your environment. Everything is a tradeoff,"" ConsenSys head of global business development Andrew Keys explained in the Ask Me Anything, a portion of the launch event where the audience tossed out questions about how Enterprise Ethereum Alliance will work.  The idea is to build an implementation that supports everything: proof-of-stake, proof-of-work, or permissioned blockchains based on consensus algorithms that predate bitcoin, such as PBFT or Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance.  Later in the day, ConsenSys lead architects Bob Summerwill and Shahan Khatchadourian put forth a technical roadmap for the project, one that looks similar to the white paper. For 2017, their goal is to create a specification for Ethereum Enterprise, building a reference client based on that specification (written in the programming language Python), and building out a package of testing tools.  The plan is to grow from there.  ""The ultimate goal is to be a lot braver than that,"" Summerwill said, later noting that pluggable consensus was on the list of things to work on down the line.  ""The intention is that the enterprise client should work perfectly well on the public chain as well,"" he added.  Budding buzzword?  However, so far pluggable consensus appears to be a longer-term project, since it might not be such an easy problem to solve.  Summerwill expanded on the term in a later panel:  ""'Pluggable consensus' is a buzzword. It sounds nice and you think you understand what it means, but it kind of doesn't really mean anything. It's like saying 'we're going to build an interface and you can stick anything behind it'. Anything? In the world? It’s obviously not going to be perfect.""  ""That's really where we're going to need to go step-by-step, starting with what we have with the ethereum setup and expanding it one thing at a time and standardizing that out,"" he continued.  While it’s clearly not a buzzword to the degree that 'blockchain' is, it’s at least been making the rounds in technical circles, with Google search results for 'pluggable consensus' turning up competing consortia, R3CEV and Hyperledger.  Even JPMorgan has developed its own very similar term for the concept. In a demo of ethereum-based Quorum, JPMorgan Python developer Tyrone Lobban referred to “configurable consensus”.  Despite the unknowns, with such popularity at the alliance's first conference and an appearance in the consortium's first paper, it looks to be a concept to look out for as the consortium's work progresses.

While BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin yesterday announced that they had completed technical upgrades requested by the People's Bank of China, local legal experts believe a decision is likely to be delayed until the end of the National People's Congress, which unites lawmakers through 15th March.  Financial services consultant Zennon Kapron, an author who has written on China's relationship with bitcoin, for example, believes it's ""unlikely"" that any change in the regulator's current positions will be made before then.  Bitcoin withdrawals at major exchanges have been suspended since 9th February, when Huobi and OKCoin revealed they would halt operations for one month in order to upgrade their AML systems.  BTCC, while originally promising a speedy return to normal, eventually said it would delay services for one month, as well, and smaller exchanges later followed suit.  In agreement with Kapron was Roland Sun, legal lead for blockchain consortium effort ChinaLedger, who said exchanges weren't likely to reopen ""this week or next"" due to the congress.  Adding to the speculation is that China-based bitcoin exchange Yunbi, which was one of the rare services not to suspend withdrawals, announced yesterday that it would cease allowing bitcoin and litecoin transactions.

Nestled into the base of Emirates Towers, Dubai Future Accelerators is home to seven blockchain startups that are now working hands-on with the government as it seeks to reach an ambitious goal: securing all of its documents on a blockchain by 2020.  In conversations with startups including CrossVerify, Loyyal, Luther Systems, Otonomos and RSK Labs, all struck a similarly optimistic tone on Dubai's outsized commitment to the technology.  Henry Sraigman, head of business development at RSK Labs, told CoinDesk the pitch was enough to convince him to relocate from Argentina when his firm was selected for incubation. Adding to the attraction, Sraigman said, was that the government program provided him a free flight and free housing, and did not take an investment stake in RSK for the work.  Sraigman explained:  ""Here there is a long commitment to innovation, the leadership is really strong and they are pushing really strong to change things.""  As part of the program, RSK Labs is now working with Dubai's Department of Economic Development (DED) on how it might use a blockchain to reduce redundancies in the licensing process for new businesses. As explained by the DED's CEO Mohammed Shael Al Saadi this week, the project aims to make it easier for businesses to register with domestic authorities – a painful, multi-step process today.  But while Dubai has the ambition, it's in short supply of those who can execute its vision, and there's a big demand here for companies with the appropriate skill set.  ""They need the workforce of our companies,"" Sraigman said.  Official backing  Yet, as Dubai’s ambitions have grown, its blockchain work has become more diffuse.  Once consolidated to the Global Blockchain Council (GBC), a consortium announced at the beginning of last year, the group now has a roadmap that finds a host of government entities managing its rollout.  For example, Dubai Customs and Dubai Trade are working with tech giant IBM on a trade finance proof-of-concept. Other startups are being paired with the Smart Dubai Office (SDO), which manages its overall citizen happiness initiative, and the General Directorate of Residency and Foreign Affairs (GDRFA), which oversees immigration, on separate work.  CrossVerify CEO Carl Weir explained that his startup saw a value in moving its operations from the UK to Dubai to capitalize on this opportunity.  Weir said:  ""We picked Dubai Future Accelerators because it’s one of the highest profile [incubators], it has the best access to government entities and it directly has the full backing of the rulers of the country.”  CrossVerify uses biometrics and a private version of the ethereum blockchain to enable anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) rules to be shared among institutions and, as such, Weir is targeting institutional clients in insurance and government military deals.  To start, however, it’s working with the GDRFA on applying the solution to Dubai's challenges in immigration, such as reducing customs times at airports and for entrepreneurs.  Weir cited the size of contracts awarded to domestic startups through the program, as well as the ability to go live with projects as a deciding factor in the application.  “It's real, it's monetizable, and it moves new projects from continual proof-of-concept stage to the real world,"" he said.  Industry credibility  Elsewhere, there's a sense that the resources Dubai is providing are the biggest draw for entrepreneurs.  Matt Hamilton, director of strategic partnerships at Loyyal, for instance, said that, while his company was one of the first startups in the accelerator, it's still focused on Western markets, which are more aware of the technology overall.  However, with Dubai pushing to increase its stature as a tech player, and many blockchain startups doing the same, Hamilton rather sees the situation as one with correctly aligned incentives.  Loyyal is now working with Emirates Airlines on a blockchain rewards points proof of concept, though he said it's not dissimilar from other projects the company has in the works. Already, Deloitte has white-labeled Loyyal’s software for use in an employee rewards program.  But the difference between the two experiences, he said, is real.  Hamilton projected that Loyyal has brought in $280,000 in revenue to date, and that 70% of that money comes directly from its Dubai work.  Hamilton indicated that these funds will be key for his firm as it seeks to court venture capitalists looking for revenue. With the government vetting startups as well, he said this can add credibility in a market that is defined by interest and, at the same time, reticence.  Hamilton summed up the difference simply, stating:  ""In the US, there's a fear of losing your job because it doesn’t work out. Here they want to be the first mover.""

42379278,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX82aur,1489053905,BIS Report: Wide-Scale DLT Use 'Years Away',"A new report from the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) has outlined three possible use cases for blockchain technology in the industry.  While conceding that blockchain and digital ledger tech (DLT) hold great promise, the paper argues that most projects are in the proof-of-concept phase and will require additional time before going mainstream.  ""The first wide-scale use of distributed ledgers in payments is likely to be years away, as technological, legal and other hurdles will need to be overcome,"" according to the work.  The paper, titled ""The Quest for Speed in Payments"", explains the three main areas of blockchain innovation as securities settlement, cross-border payments and bank-issued digital currencies.  Securities settlement has traditionally been a slow process, the multiple-day process of money changing hands could be reduced significantly by the incoming tech, according to authors who state:  “If DLT arrangements could provide real-time or near realtime settlement of the securities and associated funds transfer on the trade date, the cost savings could be significant. It would reduce record-keeping and reconciliation costs, as well as settlement costs, by eg eliminating the use of collateral to guarantee the exchange of securities and cash.”  Blockchain enabled innovation in the securities settlement space is already being explored by Australian Securities Exchange, which bought a $15m stake in Digital Asset Holdings to trail technology related to trade settlement.  The second area of innovation, cross-border payments can be streamlined by eliminating intermediaries such as Swift and Western Union, and settling directly peer to peer. However, this will be difficult, the paper states, because of jurisdictional differences regarding regulatory and operational frameworks.  The last area of innovation, bank-issued digital currencies, focused on the traditional role that the banking systems plays in payments. By decentralizing the payments process, new companies could potentially reshape banking and the financial markets.  The opinion by the BIS that blockchain tech is promising, yet a long way off, is well documented. A different paper published in February argued that much work is needed before DLT can satisfy regulatory requirements and meet industry needs.
