SEC Charges ICO Founder Over False Statements","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged a company and its president with securities fraud in connection with their efforts to raise funding via an initial coin offering (ICO).  Michael Stollery, also known as Michael Stollaire, has been accused alongside his firm Titanium Blockchain Infrastructure Services with violating the SEC's antifraud and registration provisions in connection with a multi-million dollar token sale. The agency accused Stollaire of fabricating information in claims that Titanium had relationships with companies like PayPal and Disney.  Officials with the U.S. securities regulator obtained an emergency asset freeze and the appointment of a receiver in relation to the token sale, which raised as much as $21 million, according to the SEC.  The focus on alleged misrepresentation echoes similar actions by the agency to combat fraud related to the use case, given that the SEC has accused Centra and its three co-founders of lying about their relationship with card network operators Visa and Mastercard.  Robert Cohen, the head of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit, said in a statement:  ""This ICO was based on a social media marketing blitz that allegedly deceived investors with purely fictional claims of business prospects. Having filed multiple cases involving allegedly fraudulent ICOs, we again encourage investors to be especially cautious when considering these as investments.""  According to statements, the complaint against Stollaire and Titanium was initially filed on May 22. Another company tied to Stollaire, EHI Internetwork and Systems Management Inc., was also named in the complaint.

The regulator announced Tuesday that it had ""prohibited the business model of INVIA GmbH,"" a mining firm, claiming that it was offering an unauthorized Alternative Investment Fund in violation of the Austria Banking Act. However, the full investigation into the company has not yet been completed, according to a press release.  INVIA World, the company behind INVIA GmbH, claims to mine the most profitable cryptocurrencies using a proprietary algorithm, as explained in a forum post. The mined tokens are converted to bitcoin or ethereum, which are then paid out to investors.  According to the FMA's release, INVIA did not register with the regulator, and likewise, is not licensed to offer financial products like alternative investment funds.  The move marks the first time in almost a year that the regulator has warned a cryptocurrency firm to halt its operations. Last July, the FMA stated that OneCoin was not authorized to issue or administer payment instruments, as previously reported by CoinDesk.  At the time, the regulator posted a warning on its website, alerting investors about the fraudulent nature of the scheme.

42380746,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zFFZ,1527604241,Meet Kakao: How Korea's Largest Mobile Giant Is Embracing Blockchain,"This article originally appeared on CoinDesk Korea.      Both proponents and opponents of new technology tend to come up with extreme (or overly romantic) theories about it.  This was certainly the case for bitcoin and the debate about whether the world's first cryptocurrency would replace all global currencies. However, this tendency may also underly the seeming contradiction that large corporations, which typically exert centralized control over a product or service, are embracing new decentralized technologies such as blockchain and the token economy.  Kakao is a corporate giant that dominates the Korean mobile market. Its mobile messaging app Kakaotalk accounts for 94 percent of the domestic market. Based on this overwhelming market share, Kakao has successfully expanded its operations into markets such as advertising, gaming, mobile banking, taxi services and music.  As a result, Kakao employed 2,600 staff as of 2017 and recorded annual sales of 1.9723 trillion Korean won ($1.8 billion) with an operating profit of 165.3 billion KRW ($154 million).  The company recently announced a new blockchain business.  As one of the leading ""middlemen"" that has taken control of the mobile platform market in Korea, if Kakao chooses to embrace blockchain – which eliminates the middleman and allows users to directly exchange value – what would happen to the massive profits the company currently earns in its intermediary role?  The 'middleman' exists for a reason  Seeking the answer to that question and more, CoinDesk spoke to Jason Han, the CEO of Ground X – a Kakao subsidiary that has been charged with taking forward the firm's blockchain strategy.  ""Will the middleman really disappear? Are the middlemen all bad? I don't think people are thinking seriously about these questions,"" he said.  Han is also skeptical about whether the numerous ICO projects currently underway will be able to produce services on the same level as companies like Kakao or Amazon.  ""ICOs have an odd structure. You've already made all of your money by the time you start. Let's say you can't dispose of the money for two years. Two years go by very quickly. You spend those two years working on development to get your smart contracts working, then release your service. Maybe 1,000 users sign up. But you need something more to attract more users beyond that. You have to spend a lot on marketing and go through all kinds of trouble to get your name out there. But why bother doing all that? You've already made all your money,"" he said.  Before joining Kakao in March, Han worked as the CTO of an investment company called FuturePlay, where he was responsible for evaluating the technology of companies that were potential investment targets.  ""From my investment experience, there is a huge gap between what startups promise in their white papers and what they actually deliver,"" he said.  That gap cannot be bridged simply by developing good smart contracts or designing a good token economy, argued Han.  ""Those who have real experience in business will know. When you finish development, it's not the end of the project – it's the beginning. Figuring out how to close that gap is a business problem,"" he continued, adding:  ""Until last year, nobody talked about business when they were making dapps (decentralized applications), but I think things will be different this year. Decentralization can't be the core of a service, it's just a method of providing the service. Tokens can't be the only kind of value that you offer to users. Tokens are only part of the value. What's important is the essence of the business itself.""  Pinpointing the benefits  Kakao's proposed blockchain platform, Han said, could be summed up as ""partial or gradual decentralization.""  ""Everyone is using blockchain these days because it's popular,"" he said. ""I wish people would stop trying to put everything on blockchain.""  Some of Kakao's services could be decentralized, while others cannot, Han explained. Rather than uploading a whole service to blockchain, certain functions of the components that make up the service could be separated out for decentralization and tokenization.  ""For example, let's say that we convert the mileage points system into tokens. From the company's perspective, it's just changing the money into a token format. If we did that, it would be more about making mileage more useful rather than sharing our profits with users. When you tokenize non-core aspects of the service, it allows the company to retain its profitability model while also expanding user inflow. With a forward-looking approach, tokens could also be used to provide incentives to users, but in that case there need to be benefits for Kakao as well,"" Han said.  So, what are the benefits Kakao is seeking through blockchain?  ""The token economy is a business model that no one could have imagined before,"" he said. ""Until now, Kakao has only operated in Korea, but through blockchain we could expand into the global market. That means taking a portion of the profits we earn as an intermediary and using it to expand our market by sharing it with users.""  For example, he said, if Kakao were currently earning 100 units in profits, then growing the market to 1,000 units would eventually allow the firm to give 300 back to users and keep 700 for itself.  ""What kind of strategy could Kakao adopt if it wanted to export its successful service to the Asian market? Each country already has one or two established services. The only solution I can think of is offering incentives through blockchain. With blockchain, you can shake up the existing order.""  Competitors on both sides  Kakao's longstanding rival Naver is also jumping into the blockchain industry with its subsidiary, LINE Plus.  North America-based messenger service Kik is also working on a blockchain business called KIN, while Telegram has raised $1.7 billion through an ICO, the largest amount ever recorded in a token sale.  ""The biggest concern for dapps on ethereum or EOS is how to attract users,"" Han said. ""Messenger services like Telegram have an advantage since they already have a platform with an established user base. This is why we need to pay attention to what these companies are doing. On the other hand, those messaging services have lots of users but no other services, while Kakao already provides a wide range of services.""  Although Han was skeptical of ICO projects, he does not believe that all of these startups are destined to fail.  ""Twenty years ago, nobody could have imagined a company like Google or Amazon,"" he said. ""There are so many teams working hard on their own projects, and some of them will be able to create new types of commerce that are completely different from anything we currently know. Some of them may be able to create innovative business models by focusing on decentralization. With blockchain, I think this will only take five or 10 years, not 20.""  Han provided the advertising market as an example to explain the competition he expects to see in the token economy of the future. In that industry, there are already many blockchain projects seeking to connect advertisers and consumers, thereby generating economic benefits for consumers.  At first, it will be difficult to completely remove the middleman and make the service 100 percent decentralized. Since it takes money and effort to attract advertisers and consumers, at first the middleman might take 70 percent of advertising revenue, while consumers would receive the remaining 30 percent. This model would already be competitive against current advertising agencies, where the middleman doesn't pay a cent to consumers.  Competition may lead some companies to offer 50 percent to consumers, then 70 percent, then 100 percent, eventually creating a completely decentralized system.  ""Right now, nobody knows what kinds of services might come out of the blockchain world,"" Han says. ""We haven't seen them yet. Steemit has shown us some of the potential, but nobody knows how far it will grow. But if you sit on your hands for a while and then something new comes out, it will already be too late. In this situation, having a go is the right thing to do.""  Technical issues and ICOs  LINE Plus recently announced that it plans to create a blockchain platform using the ICON network. Kakao also plans to use an existing blockchain platform. Since most platforms released so far are open source, Kakao will use the source code of a suitable existing platform and add its own unique functions on top.  Han explained that Kakao was considering many existing platforms including ethereum, tendermint, cosmos, quorum, EOS and Hyperledger.  ""Ethereum has the highest level of completion,"" he said. ""But if we want to get started quickly then quorum is also a good option. EOS has not yet released its main network, so it is difficult to conduct a deep analysis of the platform.""  He added that most existing projects have problems with performance or processing speed, and there are a host of issues outside of that which also need be resolved. The most important factor is providing a user experience that meets the expectations of the average users.  ""If a platform has a very well-refined philosophy, will users be willing to pay for that value? You need to be issued a private key and install a wallet, but if you lose your private key, you lose all your money. Even the person who created the platform can't recover the money for you. It's ridiculous to the average users. Performance and speed are the basics, but even once you've got that sorted, it's just the beginning. The first step for us is figuring out what we need to do to make Kakao's services work and how to support millions of users accessing a service at the same time.""  Kakao plans to launch its main network alongside meaningful services (dapps) by the end of the year. It appears that the first of those will be mainly created by Kakao itself, as well as external companies that already provide it with services.  ""There are outside companies that are seeking a platform for a reverse ICO, and we are willing to give them a ride on our platform if they are a good fit,"" Han said. ""We believe that the service should come first, and the platform later. A platform is useless by itself. You need to have a target service and then find a platform that will allow you to perform that service. We are not completely ruling out startups without existing services, but our main focus is on providing services that are already established.  With the Korean government effectively banning ICOs last year, issuing tokens is also a sensitive issue. When Kakao announced the establishment of its blockchain subsidiary in March, Financial Services Commission chairman Choi JongKu reaffirmed his negative view on token sales. Kakao has already made it clear that it has no plans to engage in an ICO to raise funds.  Han concluded:  ""Issuing tokens and listing on an exchange are two separate issues. There are several creative ways to issue tokens, including through an ICO, an airdrop or offering tokens as rewards for active participation on the platform like Steemit does.""

In addition, Inwage will provide assistance with creating and auditing smart contracts, as well as website security.

BitWage president Jonathan Chester said the creation of Inwage was prompted by individuals and companies who began asking for advice around the technical and marketing aspects of ICOs.  He explained:  ""We started to build out an ICO technology that people can use without relying on a third party. People can license the InWage software and host it themselves. This is actually one of beautiful things about ICOs, the ability to sell a digital asset without the requirement of a third party.""  The company has already helped the GS Mining Company and Ethmint launch the token for a platform called Moria, Chester told CoinDesk, calling it ""the world's first decentralized investment platform for precious metal extraction."" The Moria token sale aimed for $30 million, but ultimately raised $50 million during its run, he added.

As reported by CoinDesk, the Korean regulator, the Financial Services Commission, outlawed token sales in September of 2017, saying they are over-speculative and constitute a ""violation of capital market law."" And while there were reports in March that the ban might be lifted, nothing concrete has happened to date.  Now, according to BusinessKorea, the National Assembly has officially proposed legislation to permit ICOs as long as investor protections are provided for.  The legislative and policy proposal was decided upon in a general meeting, held Monday, of the National Assembly's Special Committee of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The body further hit out at the government over what it perceives as its failure to introduce promised core regulatory reform aimed to expand the role of blockchain technology in the country, the article states.  The special committee went on to recommend the formation of a task force to bring about improved transparency of cryptocurrency trading in South Korea and help develop a ""healthy"" cryptocurrency trading industry.  The committee said:  ""We will also establish a legal basis for cryptocurrency trading, including permission of ICOs, through the National Assembly Standing Committee.""  An additional suggestion was that the government should set up a committee and new governance systems to ""systematically"" develop blockchain policies and provide support to firms working with the technology.

42380728,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zEwh,1527591661,EOS Forced to Patch 'Epic' Security Loopholes Ahead of Launch,"Update (May 31, 07:47 UTC): EOS has tweeted to confirm that it has patched ""most"" of the reported bugs and is ""working hard"" on the remainder. It expects the mainnet launch to stay on schedule. See the post here.  Qihoo 360, a China-based internet security firm, says it has notified the EOS blockchain project about ""a series of epic vulnerabilities"" discovered on its platform.  The firm said in a Tuesday report that loopholes found in the EOS platform could expose nodes on the network to attackers, giving them the ability to execute code remotely and take ""full control"" of transactions. The firm claims that such an attack could potentially ""decimate"" the entire cryptocurrency network.  Qihoo 360 went on to explain that bad actors would be able to attack the network by constructing and publishing smart contracts containing malicious code on the EOS mainnet and have EOS supernodes pack them into new blocks.  Subsequently the code would affect all nodes on the network, including those of cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges, letting the attackers gain control of private keys to cryptocurrency transactions.  While EOS has not yet made any public comment on the issue, Qihoo 360 said in another blog update that the project's lead developer, Daniel Larimer, was notified of the issues and that he has since said the vulnerabilities – identified as issue number 3498 on Github – have been fixed.  ""If any of these asserts trigger in release it shouldn't pass, but should throw. Allowing the code to continue running in release is a potential security vulnerability and will likely result in crashes elsewhere,"" Larimer wrote on the Github page.  Meanwhile, Larimer has today appealed for more external assistance in identifying critical bugs in the system with the project's mainnet launch just days away, tweeting:  Following publication of the report, EOS prices slumped by as much as 11 percent, from a daily high of $12.37 to as low as $10.93. As of press time, EOS had climbed slightly to $11.22. Data from CoinMarketCap also shows that the world's fifth largest cryptocurrency by market cap has seen nearly $1.5 billion in trading volume over the last 24 hours.

Local news source Der Tagesspiegel reported Monday that Bavarian prosecutors ordered the sale on Feb. 20. At the time, bitcoin's price had rebounded to nearly $10,000 after hitting a yearly low of $5,947 on Feb. 6, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  Taking nearly two months to complete, the sale reportedly disposed of 1,312 bitcoins, 1,399 bitcoin cash, 1,312 bitcoin gold and 220 ether via over 1,600 transactions on a German trading platform.  The cryptocurrencies were all seized during two ongoing investigations being conducted by Bavarian cybercrime agencies. Although the prosecutor has not yet brought charges in the two cases, German legislation allows for emergency sales if assets seized in ongoing investigations face an immediate threat of loss of value, according to the report.  ""Since all cryptocurrencies are exposed to the risk of high price fluctuations or even total loss, the Bayern Central Office of Cybercrime ordered an emergency sale,"" the state prosecutors explained in the report.  Following the sale, the office has yet to determine how to handle the proceeds, since it remains unclear whether the prosecutor will move forward with the investigations.  At the end of last year, the Central Office of Cybercrime in Germany's Hesse state also made a notable sale of 126 bitcoins confiscated over several years through investigations on the darknet. At the time, bitcoin's price was around its all-time-high at $20,000, which resulted in proceeds of nearly $2.3 million, according to an earlier report from Der Tagesspiegel.

42380755,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zFJL,1527584405,Bitcoin Price Faces Last Major Support Level Before $5K,"Bitcoin (BTC) risks falling to the key support level of $6,900, having failed to capitalize on signs of weakening bearish momentum yesterday.  The cryptocurrency's technical charts saw a doji candle on Sunday, signaling short-term bearish exhaustion. However, a corrective rally remained elusive as bitcoin ran into offers above $7,400 and closed (as per UTC) at $7,143 – the lowest daily close since April 12, according to Bitfinex.  Prices continued to drop today, with bitcoin hitting a 7-week low of $7,040 this morning. At time of writing, the price was at $7,130.  The losses signal a continuation of the sell-off from the recent high of $9,990 and indicate scope for a drop to $6,900 – a level that the bulls need to defend at all cost. If they can't, prices may go as low as $5,000.  Daily chart  BTC created a bearish outside-day candle on Monday. These occur when a high is above the previous day's high and the low is below the previous day's low. In simple terms, it means trading on Monday started with optimism and ended with pessimism.  The bearish outside-day usually indicates a bullish-to-bearish trend change. However, when viewed against the backdrop of Sunday's doji candle, the bearish outside-day signals revival/continuation of the sell-off from the May 5 high of $9,990.  The above chart also shows the 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MA) are trending south in favor of the bears.  The relative strength index (RSI) has dropped to 30.00, indicating oversold conditions.  According to historical data, bitcoin climbs every time the RSI on the daily chart drops to or below 30.00. However, the historical pattern may not come into play this time, as BTC's long-term technical studies have turned in favor of the bears.  For instance, the weekly RSI is below 50.00 (in the bearish territory). Further, BTC recently closed below the 50-week MA for the first time since 2015, adding credence to the argument the long-run bull market is over. Meanwhile, the 5-month and 10-month MAs are beginning to slope downwards in favor of the bears.  As a result, it's likely that BTC will drop to $6,900 (triangle support) soon – although it may not happen in the next 24 hours as the short-duration chart shows a temporary bullish setup.  1-hour chart  BTC has created lower lows in the last 48 hours, but the RSI has not followed suit – a bullish divergence that indicates scope for a minor corrective rally.  View  BTC will likely drop to $6,900 (triangle support). This is the last line of defense for the bulls. A daily close (as per UTC) below $6,900 would open the doors to $5,400 (November 2017 low).  A minor corrective rally to $7,300 could be in the offing, but will likely be short-lived.  A break above the 50-week MA, currently seen at $7,702 would abort the bearish view.  Only a convincing move above $9,990 would signal a bearish-to-bullish trend change.

While the Baidu spokesperson declined to address technical questions, they did say the end goal of the integration is to help ensure the encyclopedia's credibility, as, like Wikipedia, anyone can make edits to content.  Launched in 2008, Baidu Baike primarily serves the Chinese community since its global counterpart, Wikipedia, is currently blocked within the country.  According to Baidu's own data, as of February of this year, the encyclopedia site holds over 15.2 million entries with some 6.4 million voluntary contributors making revisions.  The news marks the latest effort by the Chinese search giant in its experiments with blockchain technology.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, after launching its own blockchain-as-a-service platform in January this year, Baidu moved to trial different blockchain-based applications such a CryptoKitties knock-off and most recently a blockchain-based stock photo service.

42380744,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zFBn,1527577217,Japan's Ban Is a Wake-Up Call to Defend Privacy Coins,"Robert Viglione is the co-founder of ZenCash and a PhD candidate in finance at University of South Carolina. Prior to ZenCash, Rob was a physicist, mercenary mathematician, and U.S. military officer with experience in satellite radar, space launch vehicles, and combat support intelligence.      Crypto enthusiasts, heed this warning: Japanese regulators are veering into the unknown.  A country that once served as a beacon of hope for the development of blockchain-backed initiatives in the region has abruptly changed its stance in recent months, reconsidering the role that cryptocurrencies should be allowed to play in Japan's commercial ecosystem.  And this is no more apparent than when discussing the current state of privacy coins.  Earlier this week, the Japanese Financial Security Agency (FSA) announced that on June 18, there will be an outright ban on all cryptocurrencies that provide a sufficient degree of anonymity to its end users.  For the most part, Japanese exchanges are listening, pulling four major privacy coins — monero (XMR), dash, Augur's reputation (REP), and zcash (ZEC) — from their platforms.  As the wider crypto community begins to assess the implications of this decision, it's becoming increasingly evident that the January hack on Japanese cryptocurrency exchange CoinCheck, which resulted in the theft of 523 million NEM tokens (worth an estimated $524 million), has created a ripple effect that has had repercussions for the future of the space.  To understand the road ahead, I posit that crypto companies — especially those in the privacy space — should consider the advantages, instead of the disadvantages, that privacy coins will provide to the greater community so that they can better advocate for regulatory leniency in both Japan and beyond.  Making the case  Stepping back, if you were to ask any industry expert what the fundamental aspects of cryptocurrencies are, they would likely say immutability, fungibility, decentralization, and confidentiality. At first glance, these attributes may seem incongruous; however, they are all uniquely important to the long-term success of the industry.  For a platform to truly be considered ""decentralized,"" it must eliminate the possibility of manipulation or control exhibited by centralized entities, which cannot happen without confidentiality. And, as evidenced by the recent incidents at major multinationals Equifax and Facebook, the need to protect one's identity has never been more top-of-mind.  In fact, at present, there have been an estimated 12,918,657 exposed records thus far in 2018 alone, and that number is only expected to increase. This is why blockchain-based cryptographically secure projects are so necessary — to shield the general public from major multinationals (or hackers) looking to take advantage of their valuable information.  Similarly, for a platform to be considered ""immutable,"" it must provide unprecedented transparency to the exchange, which cannot effectively occur unless there is an added layer of privacy. Every time a cryptocurrency transaction occurs, a user's information is viewable to the entire community.  On its surface, it might seem as if most cryptocurrencies — from bitcoin to ethereum — satisfy these criteria. However, as of late, bad actors have found ways to outsmart the system. And once they do so, not only can they connect an individual to one transaction, but they can connect them to their entire crypto history.  It's becoming an undeniable truth that traditional coins will simply not fit the bill. Exchanges of the future will require more secure platforms that protect users with strong cryptography.  Privacy scapegoated  So where do we go from here? In their assessment of privacy coins, the FSA explicitly stated that a primary justification for its preemptive ban was to eliminate bad actors from being able to conduct criminal activity under the guise of anonymity.  Admittedly, the justification is sound. In the wake of the CoinCheck hack, the presence of anonymity has undoubtedly proven to be an obstacle for authorities looking to find the culprit of the attack.  But don't be fooled. There are myriad reasons for why this hack occurred in the first place, and none of them are anonymity. If the hack on CoinCheck was a primary justification for the FSA's decision, then privacy coins were an unfortunate scapegoat.  To ensure a domino effect doesn't occur in countries around the world, crypto companies should take the initiative and educate regulators about the potential value proposition that privacy coins provide to the blockchain industry.  The FSA decision is one of the first instances where a government entity has questioned the status of privacy coins and their ability to positively impact our commercial ecosystem. It won't be the last.  By taking precautionary action, companies can quell any misconceptions about the use-cases of the technology, and ensure long-term sustainability of the space for years to come.

42380748,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zFI5,1527566449,A New Twist On Lightning Tech Could Be Coming Soon to Bitcoin,"Bitcoin's lightning network may be just starting to send transactions over the blockchain, but already its developers are looking to rearchitect the technology.  That's because, while touted as a way to significantly boost bitcoin's capacity, the network itself does require users to store a significant amount of data, which makes it difficult to download and run. As such, several lightning developers – Lightning Labs co-founder 'Laolu' Osuntokun and Blockstream's Christian Decker and Rusty Russell – have published a new proposal which imagines an alternative, ""simplified"" way of making off-chain transactions called eltoo.  But the new proposal isn't only about condensing the amount of data users need to store, it's also about keeping users' cryptocurrency safe.  For instance, all this data poses another problem in that if users accidentally broadcast older data, they might lose money. As such, this data has been coined ""toxic information.""  Eltoo, on the other hand, only stores the most recent off-chain transaction data, solving the well-known ""information asymmetry"" problem – that is if something happens to the device you're running your lightning app on - say your smartphone - you might lose access to the whole history of data.  ""With eltoo, we reduce the risk of funds being swept away. We remove this toxic information,"" said Decker, who noted that the proposal's name is a joke of sorts – the phonetic spelling of ""L2,"" which stands for layer-two, what many people call technology like lightning that pushes transactions off-chain.  And this is something Decker is very interested in since he's experienced the problem personally.  ""This actually happened to me,"" he said, adding:  ""I had an old lightning node on my laptop. I restored it. I didn't know I didn't have the newest state. The guy closed the connection because they knew it was an old state! Because he could steal it. Which he did, by the way.""  All about revoking  Developers have long been trying to come up with a way for users to make a bunch of transactions using bitcoin, without bloating the blockchain with unnecessary data.  That's really what most of the scaling debates are all about.  But the first attempt to do this was way at the beginning of bitcoin's history when off-chain transaction capabilities were experimented with using so-called ""sequence numbers"" to keep track of which off-chain transaction is the most recent.  The idea was simple – if Alice has $10 and sends a $1 transaction to Bob, obviously her balance dwindles to $9.00. This then gets a sequence number ""1."" If later, she sends Bob $4, her balance is now $5, and this most recent transaction gets a sequence number ""2.""  But according to Decker, the mechanism ""didn't work out,"" because miners didn't have any reason to enforce the rules and replace old transactions with the more recent ones.  Miners could just broadcast the one transaction where Alice's balance drops to $9 (even though she had made another transaction that dropped her balance to $5). While it's unclear why a miner might want or decide to not revoke a transaction for another one, they could decide to do so since there was no enforceability.  In this way, revoking old transactions in crucial otherwise Bob might not get the second transaction and Alice could run away with the money.  This ""lack of enforceability"" is a problem that wasn't solved until 2015.  And the lightning network is the best-known solution to this problem so far. Today, revoking old state is accomplished with the ""L2-penalty"" model – whereby a lightning wallet or node stores all of these intermediary states, then, if someone tries to broadcast an earlier, now-invalid state, this is detected and the cheating user is punished by losing money.  Eltoo and L2  But, three years on, the researchers are, in fact, going back to the idea of using sequence numbers to revoke old transactions.  Unlike bitcoin's old code, which didn't have an enforcement mechanism for these sequences, eltoo adds a procedure that makes every state update prescribed. Every state update – Alice sending Bob money, for instance – is composed of two transactions, each of which both parties store and which totally replace the prior update transaction.  ""Only the last settlement transaction can ever be confirmed on the blockchain,"" the introductory blog post explains.  The tangential advantage of this system is that it increases lightning's scalability. With eltoo, each lightning node doesn't need to store all the intermediary states, rather, it stores only the most recent version and some information about the transaction itself, such as it's corresponding settlement transaction and potentially the HTLCs that spend from that settlement, the post notes.  What's perhaps the most beneficial part of the proposal, though, is that it isn't built on a ""winner takes all"" model.  Instead, eltoo and older L2 penalty schemes can be used side-by-side.  ""Eltoo has quite different tradeoffs. I'm not implying it's better in all senses,"" Decker told CoinDesk, pointing to some arguments on the bitcoin developer mailing list about the technology increasing waiting times for transactions to be settled.  Still, overall, he's pretty excited about eltoo and the simplicity it brings, adding:  ""We don't know which one is nicer, but I would like eltoo as the better option. I think eltoo is easier to explain and to extend later on.""  Code obstacle  Not only are developers still discussing the proposal's merits, but there's another thing standing in the technology's way – ""sighash_noinput.""  This long-anticipated code option needs to be added to the bitcoin codebase for the cryptocurrency to be able to support eltoo (at least in an efficient form).  To understand why, it's important to know what the basic sighash function does. It works as a flag of sorts that specifies what part of the transaction data needs to be signed when it's transferred over to someone else. Users can choose from a range of options – for instance, the default flag, sighash_all, indicates that all parts of the transaction need to be signed, meaning that none of these parts can be changed throughout the process.  The proposed ""sighash_noinput"" function could flag that the ""input"" data going into a transaction doesn't need to be signed. And in turn, that the input data can change over time, from when the transaction was created to when it's written to the blockchain.  And this is exactly what eltoo needs, since the concept is that all the state in between the beginning and final transaction will be deleted, meaning the input will be different from the start and the end.  When asked whether he thinks the sighash_noinput proposal will get merged into the bitcoin codebase, Decker laughed and said, ""Ever since SegWit, I stopped making these predictions.""  He's pointing to the fact that Segregated Witness (SegWit) had broad support from the bulk of bitcoin's most active developers, but ended up stirring up a years-long battle within the community. The code change was only added to bitcoin last August, even though it was proposed more than two years prior.  Still, even though it's early, the sighash_noinput function is a relatively easy change to make to bitcoin's codebase, Decker said.  Plus, it's been theorized for some time that the change would have many positive implications for developers, he continued. Because of these potential benefits, a handful of Twitter users have begun adding the code change to their profiles to express their support, much like Twitter users did during the scaling debate (with #No2X becoming popular among those who were opposed to the Segwit2x initiative).  Remaining hopeful, Decker concluded:  ""Every day new use cases join the sighash_noinput front.""
