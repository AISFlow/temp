42378638,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7kwgT,1456956052,New Fund Aims to Bring Bitcoin Mining Profits to High Net Worth Investors,"High net worth investors can now gain exposure to speculative bitcoin mining through what’s being billed as the world’s first ""bitcoin mining fund"".  Logos Fund  , a Regulation D offering, is positioning itself as an alternative to products like the Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT), the private investment vehicle launched by Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert, by creating an offering that blends bitcoin mining with buy-and-hold investing.  The fund was created by Marco Streng, founder of hosted cloud mining company Genesis Mining. Logos Fund managing partners include Björn Tilmann Arzt, global head of structured capital markets at UniCredit, and Dr. Florian Putzka, senior legal professional at UniCredit, though the Italian financial group is itself not directly involved.  Streng said that the fund aims to be a ""safe vehicle"" for investment in bitcoin, and that his hosted mining firm, Genesis Mining, will serve as the Logos Fund’s initial partner.  Streng told CoinDesk:  ""Mining can be profitable, but you have to have the right infrastructure, lowest electricity prices. We want to use all our expertise and infrastructure to enable external investors to leverage on bitcoin.""  Genesis Mining offers a service typically called hosted bitcoin mining, or cloud mining, in which customers can purchase contracts for a certain amount of hashing power on machines hosted at the company’s facility.  The difference between Logos Fund and Genesis Mining, Streng said, is that the fund owns the hardware directly, and that it is not wholly dependent on proceeds from mining. Arzt told CoinDesk that there is ""no corporate or other close link"" between the two companies.  To participate in the fund, investors will need to spend an unspecified minimum amount and agree to hold their funds in Logos Fund for a certain period of time. Streng said interested investors are able to access details by contacting the fund directly.  Overall, Streng positioned the offering as one that gives high net worth investors yet another option when determining how to invest in digital currencies, one he contends has its benefits compared to other available options.  ""Mining can be profitable even if bitcoin price is declining. You can still make a profit,"" Streng said.  Logos Fund intends to register as with the German financial regulator BaFin so that the offering can be available to EU investors.  ""The application is in the process of being approved and we are waiting for positive feedback from BaFin within the next 4 weeks,"" Arzt said.

42426669,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJvvVh,1456953488,The Case for Ripple in the Age of Big Bank Blockchains,"Given its early emphasis on distributed ledgers in what was then widely described as the digital currency ecosystem, Ripple has long held a unique market position in the industry. In the age of ""blockchain"", the startup remains one of the few holdouts to describe its offerings as ""distributed financial technology"".  Since it was founded in 2012, Ripple has garnered a track record of success with major banks, which have viewed bitcoin and its largely anonymous transaction validators (miners), as a potential liability. Ripple and its permissioned network, in turn, emerged as a 'safe' alternative for incumbent firms, one that wasn't colored by high levels of more negative press.  The positive market momentum would help the startup raise $38.6m from investors including Andreessen Horowitz, CME Group and Santander InnoVentures.  Michael O’Loughlin, who leads blockchain development at IT consulting firm and Ripple partner CGI Group, told CoinDesk that he believes the startup helped clean up the technology’s reputation at a key early stage.  ""Ripple has been there, from what we consider to be the start, the point where banks became aware, and Ripple was seen as a friendly,"" he said.  However, there may be signs that Ripple is now suffering from a similar change in perspective, and that it may be falling out of favor in its target market as understanding of blockchain technology advances in mainstream finance.  At the end of 2015, financial incumbents began seeking to build private blockchain solutions and consortium models to further investigate the technology behind Ripple’s offerings. In the process, some believe concerns are being raised about Ripple's target market and whether it would continue to find value in the Ripple consensus ledger.  Gartner Research vice president Ray Valdes explained:  ""Certainly they were the early mover in this wave of trying to take bitcoin technology and make it palatable to traditional financial institutions, and I think they were successful in getting some mindshare. But, now people are talking about R3 and not talking so much about Ripple.""  Valdes also mentioned the hype around Hyperledger, an open-source ""business blockchain"" initiative that seeks to unite a diversity of stakeholders. As part of that effort, IBM revealed its own consensus protocol that will be used, among other technologies from Digital Asset Holdings and Blockstream, in the Hyperledger Project. A number of major banks have also signed on.  Still, there are signs Ripple is still of interest to this market, even as the number of participants multiplies.  The startup's technology is now being used in proofs of concept (PoCs) on trial at Royal Bank of Canada, which is leveraging the technology for remittances. Standard Chartered and Development Bank of Singapore (DBS) have also begun using Ripple's tech for trade finance applications.  A senior operations manager at a banking tech solutions provider even went so far as to forecast that Ripple is on track to emerge as the blockchain equivalent of PayPal, with the company succeeding as the first blockchain alternative to global settlement engines such as SWIFT.  Cross-border push  However, given that Ripple offers a consensus protocol that is as broadly adaptable as the bitcoin blockchain, the startup has sometimes struggled to articulate and refine its goals.  ""The banks trust Ripple,"" CGI’s O’Loughlin explained. ""[But] the feedback they got from the banks is stop trying to be everything to everyone.""  This year, Ripple has shown a willingness to prioritize two efforts: the Interledger Protocol (ILP), an effort the startup is spearheading as part of the W3C that finds it using escrows to move value between distributed and non-distributed ledgers; and the Ripple consensus ledger, its original permissioned network that facilitates the movement of the digital asset XRP.  Of late, it is this second effort that has seen the most advancement, with Ripple emphasizing how both its ledger and digital assets can be used in cross-border payments.  But, Ripple does operate its consensus ledger as an open network, meaning that to some extent, it does have to consider a variety of stakeholders in its strategy. On no issue has this been arguably more apparent than the evolving narrative on XRP, the publicly traded token that serves to move value on the Ripple network.  Despite the steps taken by Ripple to distance itself from the similarities (both at launch and today), XRP and bitcoin (and other digital currencies) serve similar purposes for their respective ledgers. Both are traded openly on in public markets and are subject to the speculative whims of traders, (the price of XRP once dropped 40% on a single announcement).  Complicating matters, Ripple and a subsidiary were fined in May of last year due to Bank Secrecy Act violations in connection with the sale of XRP.  For a time it even appeared as if the company was shifting away from XRP and the Ripple consensus algorithm to focus more on Interledger. During a recent interview, however, Ripple CEO Chris Larsen rejected the idea that the company’s stance had evolved on its own technology, or more importantly, for investors, on XRP.  Larsen told CoinDesk:  ""We could do a better job of communicating that XRP is essential to the Internet of Value. The connector solutions, easy on-ramps for banks, then XRP and the Ripple consensus ledger, you’re going to increasingly see that’s part of the equation.""  Since then, Larsen has followed through on his statement, releasing a report which argued that the use of XRP as part of a Ripple integration could save institutional users more money.  The firm published estimates declaring that, by using XRP, banks would save 42% in cross-border payments costs, a figure that was higher than the 33% that using Ripple without XRP would save.  Ecosystem impact  While Ripple earns money on licensing the open-source technology and helping its clients integrate its solutions, the startup does rely on a number of third parties to manage its distributed financial network, and these parties have a more vested interest in XRP being a useful investment.  Ripple has two types of Gateway providers that help it manage its market. These include Issuing Gateways, that introduce new tokens to the network, and Private Exchanges, which serve as ways for network users to buy and sell XRP and trade between currencies.  For example, digital currency exchange provider Bitstamp is also a Ripple Gatewayhttps://ripple.com/knowledge_center/gateway-information/, meaning users can buy and sell XRP among other digital currencies on the service.  Brazil-based Rippex is another such provider. Co-founder Rafael Olaio acknowledged that Ripple could shift support away from the Ripple consensus ledger and XRP, moves that could potentially hurt the digital asset, ""maybe fatally"".  However, Olaio believes that the company has not displayed a willingness to do so.  ""Instead, they are reaffirming again their support by releasing a new paper quantifying the affirmations that XRP can cut costs on payments, and preparing a programmatic distribution of XRPs for those who increase its liquidity,"" he said. ""That is a very neat idea.""  Olaio told CoinDesk that the launch of the Interledger protocol initially ""raised concerns"" given that it did not use XRP, but that he believes the technology will support the startup’s broader mission of enabling real-time settlement.  “By connecting to Interledger, financial institutions that are resistant to [digital assets] are technologically and operationally closer to XRP and to any protocol that is ‘Interledger-enabled’,” he said.  Olaio’s statements suggest the move to introduce Interledger has been similar well-received by other key operators on the network.  Partners embrace XRP  One of the more interesting relationships related to XRP so far cultivated by Ripple is its partnership with cross-border payment specialist Earthport.  As profiled in CoinDesk  , Earthport now offers its clients access to Ripple’s technology as part of its Distributed Ledger Payments Hub. The partnership finds Earthport serving as a value-added service for Ripple, managing Ripple wallets and relationships with XRP market makers so that clients can use its tech for cross-border.  Earthport, for example, is dedicating its efforts to establishing relationships with XRP traders so that the government-issued currencies clients are looking to transfer abroad can be bought and sold quickly on both sides of the trade.  Larsen spoke to this benefit of Ripple, stating that in any use case of distributed ledgers for cross-border payments, such an exchange would be necessary.  ""You’ll need more bridging, if they only have to make one side of the trade. That’s going to be more efficient,"" he said.  Earthport's materials also positioned XRP as a ""digital asset"" that was not connected to bitcoin or other ""cryptocurrencies"". Larsen sought to portray these descriptions as semantic differences, though he said ""digital asset"" is emerging as the preferred term when describing business-to-business use cases for the technology.  ""Cryptocurrency, virtual currency, digital assets, in some ways all the same thing, they're a thing of value that has no counterparty,"" Larsen explained.  Earthport is not the only partner now engaged in improving Ripple’s XRP offering, however.  On 29th February, Ripple announced it had partnered with Crypto Facilities to launch a marketplace for XRP derivatives to enable ""hedging and speculative positioning in XRP"" and further develop the robustness of the XRP market.  Elsewhere, Ripple is working with Japan's SBI Holdings in an effort to list XRP on Asian online brokerages in an effort better facilitate trading activity, and by extension, the performance of its permissioned ledger offering.  Emphasis on diversification  In this light, Ripple’s recent market moves can be seen as a refinement of its past strategy, one that, while narrowing its efforts, has also found it more clearly staking claim on areas where it believes it can provide value to the financial industry.  To some partners, the issues Ripple has had, such as the Bank Secrecy Act violations, are even seen positively among its finance partners, with CGI’s O’Loughlin saying that the assessed fine gave the startup more credibility among major banks.  The comments suggest that, even as bitcoin retains a stigma for the use of a non-governmental currency in the operation of its distributed ledger, Ripple has been able to change the market’s thinking on XRP.  As for how Ripple will move forward, Larsen suggested banks would likely continue to use its technology in different ways, and that Ripple would seek to encourage all uses of its available offerings.  Larsen said:  ""The Ripple consensus ledger, which enables XRP, we don’t see that as a requirement for everyone to use, but as an enabler where it makes sense. We think where it fits in is in the area of market making and bridging one type of value to another type of value.""

42426651,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJvuzh,1456946403,European Parliament Event Explores Coding Regulation into Blockchain,"There is tension today between ""rule of law"" and ""rule of code"" as technology disrupts traditional ways of working.  So said Pindar Wong, chairman of financial tech consultancy VeriFi (Hong Kong), during remarks at a European Parliament event on the subject of blockchain technology in Brussels today.  The informal event  brought together a range of experts and stakeholders from both the bitcoin and blockchain industry, as well as government representatives, to investigate the topic.  The gathering was hosted by MEP Marietje Schaake of the Netherlands, in cooperation with COALA (Coalition of Automated Legal Applications) and the Dynamic Coalition on Blockchain Technologies at the Internet Governance Forum (IGF).  The workshop featured two sessions. The first offered an overview of how the technology works and its potential applications. Later, attendees examined possible regulatory approaches to blockchain tech.  The event comes amid a time of growing activity on the subject of bitcoin and blockchain within elements of the European Union governance structure. The European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) held a hearing in January and later released a report calling for a dedicated task force focused on digital currencies.  Both the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, and the European Council, composed of the bloc's heads of state as well as representatives from the Commission, are also moving to establish policies on the technology over the course of this year.  Notably, some of those present at the event pushed to bring credence to the idea that regulation of distributed ledgers could, in fact, be accomplished through the code itself, rather than a top-down approach from one agency or another.  Blockchains in governance  In his opening comments, Wong referred to blockchain tech as a ""platform for innovation"", spelling out its advantages as money you can program. The transparent and verifiable transfer of ownership aspects of the technology, he stressed, amount to a ""huge change"" in how money works.  Primavera De Filippi, a researcher at Harvard University, remarked that blockchain could change the current financial industry and ""eliminate the need for financial intermediaries"".  This, she said, would allow individuals ""who don't trust each other to actually interact and exchange value"".  De Filippi also explored the idea of how distributed ledgers can improve governance through transparency. The technology, she argued, has the potential to spread power from top-heavy institutions out to the ""edges"", thereby offering a means of reducing the occurrence of corruption by providing a greater degree of visibility for constituents.  This could mean that the traditional format of organisations can ""progressively become more flexible and quicker to adapt"" in changing situations, she suggested.  Coding in regulations  Henning Diedrich, a programmer working on IBM's blockchain initiative for the Internet of Things (IoT), weighed in on the use of the technology to facilitate the creation of decentralized entities.  Diedrich explained that an entire company could run on a blockchain through the use of various smart contracts, allowing for the development of a decentralised Uber or Facebook, for example. But such a system, he warned, could be very hard to regulate.  ""How do you punish a [decentralized] company?"" he asked.  Mentioning author Isaac Asimov's famous Laws of Robotics, he raised the question of who, in a world increasingly governed by automated systems, will be coding the rules or instituting automated regulatory mechanisms.  ""Programmers will need to know law, or lawyers will need to know code,"" he suggested.  This sentiment was echoed by Wong, who foresaw issues where blockchains could be used to manage a multitude of devices within an Internet of Things framework.  ""Sending computers to jail will make no sense,"" he said, going on to add that some kind of governance model will be essential in this instance.  The question of regulation  Wong used his introduction to raise the question of whether the technology should be regulated at all.  ""Would the Internet have happened if we had to apply the letter of the law of copyright?"" he asked.  Suggesting that regulation could stifle innovation in the space, Wong put forward the possibility that the technology itself could be leveraged to meet those perceived requirements.  Taking a similar view, De Filippi questioned what it means to regulate blockchain technology anyway. ""It's a data structure,"" she said.  The researcher suggested it may make more sense to focus regulatory efforts on the apps built on top of open and private blockchains rather than the technology itself.  Ruth Wandhöfer, CitiBank's global head of regulatory and market strategy, provided the overview that distributed ledgers can indeed usher in beneficial changes in finance.  Private and hybrid blockchains, she said, could bring increased privacy and control and, by removing the middleman, force the banks to change or even disintermediate them completely. Further benefits can be found in the removal of what she called centralised ""honeypots"" that are attractive to bad actors.  However, Wandhöfer concluded that some degree of regulation will be needed in order to ""establish trust"".

42426648,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJvuvh,1456934440,Bank of England Official: Digital Currencies Could Impair Bank Lending,"Bank of England deputy governor for monetary policy Ben Broadbent argued in a speech today that bitcoin is unlikely to obtain widespread adoption – but that central bank-issued digital currencies could have a big impact on the global financial system.  In a talk at the London School of Economics, Broadbent focused specifically on the evolving relationship between digital currencies and central banks, a topic that Bank of England staffers have broached in the past.  The deputy governor dismissed the possibility that digital currencies such as bitcoin could become widely used as a payment mechanism or a unit of account, stating:  ""The main point here is that the important innovation in bitcoin isn't the alternative unit of account – it seems very unlikely that, to any significant extent, we'll ever be paying for things in bitcoins, rather than pounds, dollars or euros – but its settlement technology, the so-called 'distributed ledger'.""  Broadbent used his speech to discuss the potential characteristics of a future central bank-issued digital currency, as well as the impact this issuance could have on the commercial banking system.  While highlighting some of the benefits of a central bank-issued digital currency, he notably remarked that those banks could see a degree of impairment if adoption took hold.  He also discussed the application of distributed ledgers to the financial system, stating that ""decentralised virtual clearinghouse and asset register[s]"" may be a better way of describing the technology.  Impact on banks  Broadbent suggested that people who previously kept their funds in a commercial bank might be more immune from a bank run if that money is kept under the auspices of a central bank instead.  ""Currently, retail deposits are backed mainly by illiquid loans, assets that can't be sold on open markets; if we all tried simultaneously to close our accounts, banks wouldn’t have the liquid resources to meet the demand,"" he said. ""The central bank, by contrast, holds only liquid assets on its balance sheet. The central bank can’t run out of cash and therefore can’t suffer a 'run'.""  This shift, however, would have consequences for commercial banks. Namely, their ability to lend money or support their operations without relying on potentially unstable capital markets.  ""On the other hand, taking deposits away from banks could impair their ability to make the loans in the first place,"" he said, adding:  ""Banks would be more reliant on wholesale markets, a source of funding that didn't prove particularly stable during the crisis, and could reduce their lending to the real economy as a result.""  What will drive this scenario, he said, is the features of a central bank-issued digital currency.  Broadbent suggested that, if it shares characteristics with a bank account or enables the generation of interest, deposit holders may take their funds elsewhere, particularly during times of economic stress.  Research continues  As noted by Broadbent, the Bank of England is in the midst of a comprehensive research effort focused on the technology.  He closed his speech with a call to action for possible contributors, noting how digital currencies factor significantly into the central bank's research priorities for the year ahead.  It was earlier this year that the Bank of England indicated that it was looking at the technology for possible applications in settlement.  The Bank of England has published past research on the topic, remarking at the time that digital currencies could reshape the payments space and, in the event of broader adoption, impair the ability of central banks to conduct monetary policy.

42426662,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJvvJh,1456925759,"Visa Seeks Developer for 'Secure, Scalable' Blockchain Project","Payments giant Visa has revealed it is seeking to hire a software engineer to help it create a ""secure, scalable blockchain network"".  The news was revealed in a job advertisement by Visa Research – a research arm created by the company to expand its technology capabilities.  Visa Research's remit is to engage with the company's technology and product teams, as well as business and other partners, to investigate and develop technologies that are ""critical to the payments industry in the future"", the firm says.  As part of its efforts to build three research sections covering data analytics, security and 'future of payments', the ad seeks an ""outstanding"" senior staff software engineer for the payments team.  With a wide ranging scope that covers blockchain, QR codes, digital currency and other emerging payment technologies, the research team will reportedly work to develop a proof-of-concept for its blockchain network.  Skills and experience  Visa suggests the role represents an opportunity for a new hire to make ""key contributions"" to its innovation efforts in the payments industry.  Responsibilities include designing and developing the blockchain network, implementing machine learning algorithms and applications, and developing a proof-of-concept prototype with ""fast iteration and experimentation"".  Among a long list of skills, candidates will require programming experience, cryptography and ""competency in data structures, algorithms and software design optimized for building highly distributed and parallelized systems"". Experience at a commercial blockchain platform such as Chain ""may be a plus"", it says.  The news comes as Visa's interest in blockchain technologies escalates following its participation in Chain's $30m funding round last September. In October 2015, the firm unveiled a new proof-of-concept that uses the bitcoin blockchain for recordkeeping.  That project, outlined in a blog post, focused on digitizing the process of leasing a car, with bitcoin transactions used to create a 'digital fingerprint' for each vehicle, and new transactions published throughout the leasing process.
