42397190,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAacMNW,1373106530,Why Edward Snowden should be using bitcoins,"Edward Snowden’s situation is precarious. Right now, he is stuck in a Russian airport. He is a man of no country, because no country seems to want him. It’s a uniquely Orwellian scenario, one that Snowden himself likely never expected to be caught in. He felt that the information he had at his grasp needed to be free. Yet it almost appears as if he couldn’t fathom what an international situation that this data would cause him.      Former spies have chimed in on what they might have done in Snowden’s situation. The consensus seems to be that any sort of modern comfort most of us take for granted would be tossed out the proverbial window.      ""That means [discarding] your phone, your computer, your bank accounts, passport, credit cards - absolutely anything that you had previously,” before going on the lam, says Charles Faddis, a former CIA operative.      No bank accounts? No credit cards? You’d have to use cash - or possibly bitcoin - in order to survive.      Had Snowden been more familiar with decentralized currencies, he might have been able to stay out of the eye of authorities. Although he would not have been able to do things like buy an airline ticket, that point would have been moot given his revoked passport.      There is an economy forming under the auspices of bitcoin. Many people desire a reasonable expectation of privacy, something that the banking status quo is against in order to comply with, you guessed it, the government.      Of course, there is one logistical problem to using bitcoins. You have to find people who will actually accept it for goods and services. This can be a difficult undertaking in the physical world, as there are many who own or transact in bitcoins that would rather remain private.      But according to LocalBitcoins, you can trade in bitcoins for Hong Kong dollars. In fact, using the physical transactions options available via LocalBitcoins you could move around pretty well if you had kept a nice stockpile of BTC.      Before telling anyone who he was, Snowden should have considered attending a Hong Kong-based Bitcoin Meetup, which has 103 members. That's just as many as the Washington DC-based bitcoin Meetup has, which means there is some traction for bitcoins in HK.      People have called into question Snowden’s decision to flee to Hong Kong at all. In reality, Hong Kong is a perfect fleeing spot for an American leaker unsure of his future: all you have to do is buy a flight there. There’s no need for a visa, as visitors with a US passport can arrive and stay for 90 days. And judging by Hong Kong’s statement about Snowden leaving, the cards were played right by the former CIA employee releasing information about the US spying on Hong Kong.      Convicted spy Christopher Boyce, who is spending 40 years in prison for selling secrets to Russia, recently told CNN that “Snowden is doomed”. Yet all indications are that Snowden, unlike Boyce, is not doing this to make money. He’s only attempting to break down the walls of the spy apparatus system that the United States has proliferated over the past decade.      Ultimately, Snowden’s apparent ideology mirrors that of proponents of the bitcoin ecosystem. Bitcoin doesn’t exist as a way to subvert the American way; it is there to supplement its ideals.      The desire is to prove that a better system exists, a better way of life. On the face of it, a government that continually prints money just cannot be healthy for the global economy. The markets are starting to show proof of that. You can see this where investors are pulling their money out of gold and government securities. It appears that despite quantitative easing, we could see signs of strain in the system once again.      Of course, strain is probably part of the daily condition for Edward Snowden right now. Could bitcoins have ultimately aided his predicament? It certainly wouldn’t have left a trail like a credit card or a bank record would, but it isn’t completely anonymous.      Nothing is anonymous anymore, except for spying. The Guardian has recently reported Snowden may be the last of the human spies because there will be little human involvement in spying at all in the future.      That’s an interesting argument given that it is people who create technology, and people that run it. How would it even be possible to spy without human involvement?      Anyone who has been a part of the bitcoin community knows that there is a human element to it, a hard belief in it. At least it is more believable than a lot of the things that the establishment wants people to hear.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/06/why-edward-snowden-should-be-using-bitcoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/28cd8ada6b44db1209ba0a0d0927eded697b95e8-500x335.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397173,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAacM7m,1373100784,The rise of Bitcoin: Bitcoin London's investors and entrepreneurs,"Excerpt from Financial Times    Bitcoin, a decentralised, virtual currency, is garnering increasing interest from investors and entrepreneurs. The FT's Maija Palmer reports from a Bitcoin conference on where the currency is heading and goes to buy her first (fraction) of a Bitcoin.  Maija Palmer: In the centre of London’s financial district, a crowd of some three hundred entrepreneurs and investors gathered this week to discuss what many believe could be a game-changer for the way we use money. Bitcoin, a decentralized virtual currency began life as something of an experiment. Could an electronic currency which is not issued by any government and which exists only as a string of numbers on a network of computers really work?  Erik Voorhees (Chief Executive, Coinapult): A lot of bitcoin use is simply person-to-person payments. So if you owe your buddy some money for beers, you can pay him on your cell phone at the bar. Or if you have programmers that are working for you over in India, you can pay them bitcoin without having a huge fee or a two week payment delay. And those people then buy services with the bitcoin, so it’s a very organic process that sort of just grows, and it will continue to grow as long as people find bitcoin useful.  Maija Palmer: Bitcoin made headlines at the start of the year, when its value shot up from thirteen dollars per bitcoin to over two hundred. Although the price is now down to just under ninety dollars, the cryptocurrency, worth an estimated nine hundred and ninety million dollars in total, has peaked investor’s interest and a small but growing number of companies are accepting bitcoin payments. It is also becoming easier for even the not so tech savvy to use bitcoins.  Maija Palmer: So I’m about to become a bitcoin investor on a very small scale. I have a five-pound note and I’m going to buy my first ever fraction of a bitcoin. What I did earlier was I downloaded an app onto my phone, which gives me my wallet, which is basically represented by this QR code here, which is what I’m going to need to interact with this ATM machine. So - press start. Scan the phone. And now it is asking me to insert the bill. And send bitcoins. And it says “Your bitcoins are on their way” to this very long string of numbers. And hopefully that will have updated on my phone. There we go. I can see the transaction has come in. This payment should become spendable in a few minutes.  Maija Palmer: Spending my bitcoin wealth is still a little challenging. But, according to the purveyor of the Bitcoin ATM, Josh Harvey, this could all change.  Josh Harvey (Co-Founder, Lamassu Bitcoin Ventures): There’s a company called BitPay in the United States, and they are signing up thousands of merchants every month. I think there are over ten thousand now. It started with big names like WordPress and NameCheap, which is a very large domain name registrar, and now you are seeing a lot of smaller retail locations. There is a supermarket in San Francisco, cupcakes in San Francisco, restaurants in New York, restaurants in Massachusetts. These big techie cities are going to be the first places where you are going to see the adoption, and it will just kind of take off slowly and gradually from there.  Maija Palmer: Investors with a healthy appetite for risk are starting to make their first forays into the bitcoin market.  Shakil Khan (Spotify Angel Investor, Founder of CoinDesk): It’s pretty obvious digital currency is going to happen whether it’s bitcoin, an evolution of bitcoin, or some other currency. The jury is still out on that, we won’t know until it happens. But for me, looking at it from a technology point of view, an investment point of view, and really the excitement, it’s similar to the internet in 1995-1996. I semi-missed that boat, and often think back and wonder what it would have been like to be involved in companies then, so I guess this is my second chance.  Maija Palmer: But the biggest problem for bitcoin enthusiasts is confusion over regulation. The US Federal Government has seized bank accounts of bitcoin exchanges, citing rules designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. While elsewhere regulators remain non-committal.  Stefan Greiner (Xenion Legal): I’m afraid they have to be worried about the regulatory aspect, because the regulatory bodies in the US and all over Europe have not really formed an opinion about what bitcoin is, what bitcoin’s transactions are. You should think about how you can pay for the regulation, because this is… On a practical level, this is the crucial point - when the regulation comes, it will cause a lot of costs.  Maija Palmer: Many remain sceptical as to whether bitcoin can survive these regulatory hurdles. But, with its anonymity and the ease and speed with which payments can be made, there does seem to be an appetite for something like Bitcoin to exist. The financial services sector should take note. If it isn’t bitcoin, it is likely something similar will soon emerge from the shadows.  Maija Palmer, Financial Times, London.
