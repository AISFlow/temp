42406300,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetSbq,1619901046,Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Sees Largest Downward Adjustment of the Year,"Bitcoin’s mining difficulty just fell by 12.6%, the network's largest downward correction of the year, following mass miner outages in China’s coal-rich provinces.      Mining difficulty is a self-correcting and internally referenced score that dictates how hard it is for miners to find the next block in Bitcoin’s blockchain. (Bitcoin’s starting difficulty was 1. Every increase from this indicates exponentially increasing difficulty.) The difficulty adjustment ensures blocks are added to the chain at a steady pace, roughly every 10 minutes on average.    Read more: How Bitcoin Mining Works    Bitcoin’s mining difficulty is currently 20.608 trillion, according to data from this journalist’s node. This is down from the 23.581 trillion difficulty Bitcoin set nearly two weeks ago, an all-time high.      The sizable drop corrects for the loss of hashrate the Bitcoin network experienced following coal mining accidents and subsequent inspections in Xinjiang. As they lost their chief source of energy, bitcoin miners in this coal-heavy region went offline and Bitcoin’s hashrate fell by roughly a quarter.      ""The 12.6% difficulty drop is the largest negative difficulty adjustment since 2012, excluding November 2020 (end of hydro season), March 2020 (Black Thursday) and December 2020 (end of hydro season), meaning that it’s a great time to be a miner. The drop is primarily caused by the inspections and associated power outages in Xinjiang. Although the majority of mining farms in the regions have recommenced mining, the network hashrate has not quite reached all-time high again,"" Compass Mining CEO Thomas Heller told CoinDesk.      Some of these miners are back online and Bitcoin’s hashrate has recovered. But as the difficulty adjustment suggests, more miners need to come back online before the network is at the levels it sported a few weeks ago.    Bitcoin mining centralization    ""The event in Xinjiang highlights that a major portion of hashrate production still occurs in China. Seasonal and government changes have the potential to swing hashrate levels and have profound impacts on network difficulty and mining economics,” Ethan Vera, the CFO of North American mining pool Luxor, told CoinDesk.      “Bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment algorithm is working exactly as planned, compensating for slower block times with a downward adjustment. While the 2,016 block epoch is not perfect, it has been battle tested against all sorts of events and always done its job.”      Vera expects the substantial correction to put miner profitability at over 40 cents per terahash, meaning roughly “90% mining margins” for miners on average.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/05/01/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-sees-largest-downward-adjustment-of-the-year,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a2089005bf24bf98259115a45a3a2010202d3e72-2309x1299.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406306,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetSgl,1619900232,Bitcoin Taproot Activation Has Begun; Miners Now Have 3 Months to Get on Board,"Bitcoin’s Taproot update has finally begun its Speedy Trial.      Today’s difficulty adjustment kicks off the first phase of activation for the upgrade, Bitcoin’s biggest in years that (among many things) will make Bitcoin multi-signature transactions cheaper, more private and easier to deploy.    Read more: How Bitcoin’s Taproot Upgrade Will Improve Technology Across Bitcoin’s Software Stack    Starting today, miners who wish to adopt the upgrade can signal their support by including special data in the blocks they mine called a “signal bit.” If 90% of the blocks mined during this difficulty period include the Taproot signal bit (or any of the other roughly two week difficulty periods that occur between now and the August 11 timeout), then the upgrade is “locked in” for activation in November of this year.      Unlike a centralized network that can be changed unilaterally, a decentralized network like Bitcoin requires coordination from a global userbase to make substantial changes to its code, and it also requires intensive coordination among stakeholders to deploy these changes (as evidenced by the months-to-year-long discussions, not on the uncontroversial upgrade, but on how to bring it online).    Taproot when?    So if everything goes as planned, Taproot will be live on Bitcoin’s blockchain before the holiday season. If the network doesn’t achieve the 90% threshold before the timeout, then the upgrade fails and we are back to the drawing board.      This isn’t likely, though. Miners have already pledged their support for Taproot, so it’s really a matter of when rather than if, said Poolin VP Alejandro del la Torre, who ran the original mining pool survey to gauge Taproot support among the mining community      “I am confident it will happen,” he told CoinDesk, adding that “up to now there has not been one complaint from our miners at Poolin about our wish to upgrade to Taproot.”    Read more: All Major Mining Pools Now Support Taproot    Suredbits and Bitcoin Core developer Ben Carman told CoinDesk the network will “pass [the signaling threshold] most likely in the second difficulty period.”      “Previous soft forks, besides SegWit, all activated near the very beginning of their activation window, and that was all with needing 95% of miners. Now we only need 90%,” he said.      Voicing similar sentiments, prolific Bitcoin developer Matt Corrallo said he is “cautiously optimistic.”      Anyone wishing to track the percentage of Taproot-signaled blocks per period can visit Taproot.watch.    Fork in the road    A release candidate for Bitcoin Core 0.21.1, which contains Speedy Trial's activation logic, is now available on GitHub.      Two weeks before this software release for Bitcoin Core (the client that runs ~98% of the Bitcoin network), Bitcoin developer Bitcoin Mechanic released an alternative Taproot activation client in concert with others like renowned yet controversial Bitcoin developer Luke Dashjr.      This version is compatible with Bitcoin Core up to a point; if miners signal, then Taproot activates network wide no issue; if miners don’t, this alternative client includes a “flag day” for mandatory activation in October 2022.      This “user activated soft fork” (UASF) scenario allows node operators to reject blocks from miners who don’t signal for Taproot to essentially force the upgrade.    Read more: Taproot Has Been Merged Into Bitcoin Core: Here’s What That Means    Bitcoin stakeholders couldn’t come to a consensus on whether or not to include a UASF in Bitcoin Core's activation, hence the months of debate. Critics argued there’s no need for such extensive deliberation, given that miners have shown no opposition to Taproot unlike the way they did with SegWit (a 2016-2017 upgrade that required the threat of a user activated soft fork to bring to fruition).      “People are shadow boxing casper right now lol,” Lightning Labs CTO Olaoluwa Osuntokun said at the time, suggesting the calls for a UASF come from “PTSD” from the SegWit saga.      Proponents of the UASF say it’s necessary to reinforce the precedent that node operators ultimately decide upgrades, not miners. (Miners may run nodes and provide a necessary utility for the network but shouldn't have outsized sway, the argument goes.)      Judging by the data and sentiment we have now, though, it probably won’t have to come to a UASF, but we’ll know for sure come August.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | FORKS,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/05/01/bitcoin-taproot-activation-has-begun-miners-now-have-3-months-to-get-on-board,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/42797ca157cbfa8f3bacef90021f82753a229044-2560x1092.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Dash awaited additional cues to rise above its stiff resistance level at $328,60. Finally, Filecoin could move sideways before rising north of the $167.8-resistance. XRP Source: XRP/USD, TradingView With news around XRP creating a lot of buzz in the market, the cryptocurrency has latched on to the positive sentiment surrounding it to hike on the charts. Gains over the past week alone have amounted to over 44% and more could be incoming over the coming days. On the daily charts, XRP traded within a symmetrical triangle, but a breakout was not clear, at least over the short term. At the time of writing, a candlestick switched to red after touching the upper trendline and the price would likely show choppy movement between the two trendlines before breaking to the upside. The Fibonacci extension levels at 50%, 61.8%, and 78.6% presented a few targets for the bulls in the event of an upwards breakout from the current pattern. The RSI settled below 65 but was still in bullish territory. If the MACD completes a bullish crossover, the price could move north of the upper trendline sooner than expected. Dash [DASH] Source: DASH/USD , TradingView Dash closed in on a major resistance level at $328.60 on the 4-hour timeframe, but the trading volumes were not there yet to support a northbound move. In fact, the RSI dropped below the overbought territory and suggested that DASH needed to stabilize before the next leg upwards. This could take place at the $295 support level - a region that has historically shown some buying behavior during previous rallies. The Awesome Oscillator noted a shift in momentum to the bearish side as the price approached its upper ceiling. Momentum could once again change hands once the price touches the defensive line at $295. Filecoin [FIL] Source: FIL/USD , TradingView Filecoin moved north from its downwards sloping trendline, but the resistance level at $167.9 limited gains across the market. The Stochastic RSI showed a bearish crossover in the overbought zone and a pullback could be cushioned at the $161.5-support - a region that coincided with the 200-SMA (green). If the price is unable to break above its upper ceiling, some sideways movement can be expected within its immediate support and resistance. Meanwhile, the Chaikin Money Flow floated above the half-line as capital inflows remained strong for FIL. This could act as a buffer against a price drop.
