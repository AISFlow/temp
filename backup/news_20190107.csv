42381465,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9Rn2h,1546900112,Ethereum Classic's Price Stumbles Amid Suspected 51% Attack,"The price of ethereum classic (ETC) is pulling back as a result of a recently reported attack that resulted in a series of blockchain history rewrites.  At press time, ETC is trading at an average price of $5.01 – down more than 7.5 percent in the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  ETC had fallen to an intraday low of $4.93 at 20:00 UTC, which at the time registered a near 10 percent daily depreciation.  Ethereum Classic Price Chart  As can be seen in the above chart, the price of ETC began to see a sell-off after it reached $5.51 at 17:00 UTC yesterday - its highest price since Dec. 26.  Initial reports of the suspected 51 percent attack – by which an entity controls a majority of a network's processing power and can then attempt to rewrite its history – appeared at roughly 5:00 UTC, at which time price was trading at $5.30 and remained stable until 9:00 UTC, when the sell-off began to accelerate. The price would ultimately drop more than 12 percent at 20:00 UTC from its 24-hour high.  While ETC, the 18th largest cryptocurrency in the world by market cap, is not the worst performing cryptocurrency of the day, it is noticeably under-performing the other major cryptocurrencies.  At the time of writing, ETC is the only cryptocurrency out of the world’s 20 largest to report a 24-hour loss above 5 percent. For reference, bitcoin is reporting a minor loss of less than 1 percent today.  Disclosure: The author holds BTC, AST, REQ, OMG, FUEL, 1st and AMP at the time of writing.

42430085,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMRAVh,1546892368,Coinbase Suspends Ethereum Classic After Blockchain History Rewrites,"Crypto exchange Coinbase has halted all ethereum classic transactions, withdrawals and deposits due to a series of blockchain history reorganizations on the network.  Ethereum classic saw more than 100 blocks ""reorganized"" during a potential 51 percent attack late Sunday, according to at least two different block explorers - Bitfly (Etherchain) and Blockscout. Coinbase said in its blog post that it detected some 88,500 ETC being double-spent (totaling some $460,000).  Media publication Coinness reported Monday that an in-house analyst had detected an abnormal hash rate (or computation energy) going into a single mining pool, potentially causing mass reorganizations (reorgs) of mined blocks. Though initially refuted by the core proponents behind ethereum classic on Twitter, the official account has now affirmed potential cause for concern, tweeting out:  ""We are now working with Slow Mist and many others in the crypto community. We recommend exchanges and pool significantly increase confirmation times.""  SlowMist, a China-based security firm, first alerted users of the strange activity occurring on the network Monday morning, stating that its team was trying to trace the cause of the attack. SlowMist did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Recent reports from Coinness stated that “certain abnormality” had been detected in the mining hash rate of a private ethereum classic mining pool.  Disputed accounts  The duration of the attack seems to be in dispute. Blockscout reported block reorganizations occurring at 02:00 UTC and 05:00 UTC Monday, while Bitfly said in a Tweet at 17:00 UTC that the attack was potentially ""ongoing."" In its note, Coinbase wrote that ""the attacks are ongoing.""  Blockscout project lead Andrew Cravenho affirmed to CoinDesk that although the last recorded reorg attack was seen 14 hours ago, the network is constantly ""fluctuating and people are always switching their hashing power,"" suggesting the potential for continued disruption under ""the perfect circumstances.""  He also noted that the reorg may have begun before being noted on Blockscout. In a blog post, Coinbase said it first noticed the reorg on Jan. 5, two days before other reports began.  And though reiterating to CoinDesk that indeed “a huge reorg took place” on the ethereum classic blockchain, Cravenho’s explanation of the event as a 51 percent attack is not widely agreed upon.  In an email to CoinDesk, ethereum classic dev advisor Cody Burns said that the activity could not be labeled a 51 percent attack but rather “a selfish mining attack” caused by a client-local phenomenon.  He added in a post on Twitter that ""...the entire Ethereum network doesn’t ‘reorganize’ simultaneously. It would be more likely that someone discovered all of Coinbase ETC nodes and ‘surrounded’ them.""  Still, Burns suggested in an email to CoinDesk that regardless of the situation's origin, companies providing services for ethereum classic should take steps to protect their users.  ""The best course of action is for businesses and exchanges using ANY ethereum based chain is to increase the number of confirmation blocks to >400 blocks,"" he wrote.  In response to the deep reorg, Kraken announced in an incident report that it was increasing the number of confirmations required to make an ethereum classic deposit. Bitfly told CoinDesk that it was likewise taking this action.  Poloniex announced it was disabling ETC wallets, and it does not currently have a firm timeline on when they will be re-enabled.  Responsibility  The ethereum classic Twitter account claimed that the excessive hashrate may have come from crypto miner manufacturer Linzhi, which reportedly confirmed it was testing new machines with a 1,400Mh/s hashrate.  However, in an email to CoinDesk, Linzhi Shenzhen director of operations Wolfgang Spraul pushed back, saying ""We are categorically denying such claims, they are entirely baseless and may be part of the attack itself.""  The company has not yet launched its first product, he said, adding:  ""If we would test our ASICs, we would never do that on any mainnet, we would do that on a testnet or a private net. We would most likely invite independent industry figures like David Vorick or Anthony Lusardi to observe what we are doing.""

42430079,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMRAJh,1546885813,Overstock's tZERO Wins Patent for Integrating Crypto With Legacy Trading Tech,"Security token trading platform tZERO, a portfolio company of digital retail giant Overstock, has won a patent outlining how it may merge legacy trading systems with cryptocurrencies and digital asset tech.  Published Thursday  by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the patent describes a ""Crypto Integration Platform"" capable of combining market information from a variety of sources to determine best prices. The system would then ""secure both the digital transactional items (i.e., the funds for a buy order and the digital assets or liabilities for a sell order)"" before conducting the transaction.  These transactional items could include digital assets, liabilities, commodities, cryptocurrencies, tokens or cash.  According to the patent, the system will also sign the transactional items cryptographically prior to matching the orders.  The document further explains:  ""The Crypto Integration Platform provides, among other things, an interface between legacy trading systems and crypto exchanges that trade digital transactional items. In doing so, the Crypto Integration Platform takes a protocol for trading and communication between broker-dealers, Alternative Trading Systems (""ATS""), and exchanges, and transforms the message so that the trade can be consummated using cryptographic techniques.""  The patent explains that it uses the technology to verify the ownership of all items, as well as ensure that only available items can be exchanged.  TZERO also noted that the platform can be used to conduct initial public offerings (IPOs) or other public securities offerings, as well as in secondary market securities transactions (noting that these offerings would be registered through the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission).  Perhaps the most notable aspect of the platform, however, is its focus on integrating crypto trading systems with legacy trading systems.  The patent notes that a number of processes are being introduced which ensure orders for digital assets are submitted through a legacy system; crypto trading orders entered into legacy systems are authorized by the right entity; and that matching cryptographic transactions are based on the proper private and public keys.  As part of the procedure to properly introduce these processes, tZERO may develop ""special-purpose hardware,"" the document explains.  The trading platform is expected to launch sometime this year, after unveiling a prototype last April. The startup has already begun some operations, however, after being tasked with developing a security token to trade cobalt.

42430098,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMRAth,1546869621,Crypto Exchange Kraken Says US Subpoenas Becoming 'Barrier to Entry',"San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has said that the cost of handling government subpoenas is fast becoming a “barrier to entry” in the U.S.  On Saturday, the exchange tweeted an infographic from its ""2018 Transparency Report,"" indicating that the law enforcement and other inquiries it has received from various government agencies around the world have almost tripled year on year.  The firm received a total of 475 subpoenas in 2018 compared to 160 in 2017, with the majority (315) coming from U.S. agencies. The U.K. came in second with 61 requests and Germany third with 34.  “You can see why many businesses choose to block US users,” Kraken said in its tweet.  Breaking down the U.S. figures, the agency making highest number of inquiries at Kraken was Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) with 91 subpoenas. That was followed by the FBI with 67 and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) with 40. The SEC and the CFTC made 29 requests combined.  Kraken said in a Twitter thread that it gets requests for ""all transactions, which could be petabytes of data when they actually only need the withdrawals from last week for one guy.” Such inquiries are “taxing” on the firm's resources as they often require a “significant amount of education and back-and-forth,” it said.  When asked why it received more inquiries from the U.S. than other nations, the exchange replied:  “US is about 1/5 of clients but 2/3 of requests. US agencies are much more active and are much less surgical. For many requests, we have no matches. It wouldn't be surprising to find that the same subpoenas go out to everyone in the hopes that a match will be found.”  The exchange is famously critical of U.S. officialdom. Back in April, Kraken CEO Jesse Powell told CoinDesk that the exchange would not be complying with an inquiry into crypto exchanges launched by the New York Attorney General (NYAG). “I realized that we made the wise decision to get the hell out of New York three years ago and that we can dodge this bullet,” Powell stated at the time.  Later, in September, when the NYAG report was released, finding that many crypto exchanges are vulnerable to market manipulation, Powell further tweeted that “NY is that abusive, controlling ex you broke up with 3 years ago but they keep stalking you...""

A Bloomberg report on Monday, citing a person ""familiar with the matter,” said that the FSA is currently ascertaining institutional interest in ETFs that track cryptocurrencies and could ultimately give them the go ahead.  Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party will reportedly submit draft legislation by March 2019, that could include such a move through amendments to existing financial rules. The bill, which would also bring in more self-regulatory oversight of the industry and class many ICO tokens as securities, could come into law by 2020, the report indicated.  However, Bloomberg added that the FSA has now dropped plans to include approval for trading crypto derivatives on financial exchanges due to concerns the products would mainly lead to speculation.  The increased scrutiny of the crypto space in Japan follows a major hack of the Coincheck exchange in January that saw around $533 million in cryptocurrencies stolen.  Crypto ETFs are seen by many market observers as a means to bring institutional capital into the sector, though not all are keen on the idea.  In the U.S., several participants are planning to launch such products, although the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not yet approved any. Back in August, the the agency rejected nine bitcoin ETF applications “to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices,” and in December postponed a decision on a product from VanEck/SolidX until February.

42430097,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMRArh,1546858815,Breakout Ahead? Bitcoin Closes on Key Price Hurdle,"Bitcoin's (BTC) bears would be put on the back foot if prices climb past key resistance lined up at $4,140.  The leading cryptocurrency jumped to a two-week high of $4,090 earlier today, as expected, ending a weeklong period of low volume consolidation near $3,800.  Notably, the break above $4,000 has added further credence to the short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change signaled by the three-day chart on Dec. 20.  The job, however, is only half done for bulls, as prices are yet to take out the resistance at $4,140 – the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal pattern. A convincing break above that level would put the bulls back into the driver's seat.  That said, a longer-term bullish reversal would be confirmed only above the former support-turned-resistance of the 21-month exponential moving average (EMA) of $5,567.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $4,000 on Bitstamp, representing a 5 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  Daily chart        As seen above, BTC has charted an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, which represents a transition from the bear market to the bull market – a low followed by recovery (left shoulder), a bearish-lower low and recovery (head), and finally a bullish-higher low and recovery (right shoulder).  A breakout from an inverse head-and-shoulders usually yields a powerful move to the upside. BTC, therefore, could rise well above $5,000 (target as per the measured move method) if the neckline resistance, currently seen at $4,140, is crossed on the back of high trading volumes.  Further, the cryptocurrency has found acceptance above the 50-day moving average (MA) hurdle, while the 5- and 10-day MAs are trending north, indicating a bullish setup. The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is also biased toward the bulls.  Hence, prospects of a bull breakout above $4,140 appear high.  Monthly chart  On the monthly chart, the outlook remains bearish while BTC is trading below the 21-month EMA of $5,567. Interestingly, the trendline connecting the December 2017 and November 2017 highs is also located near the 21-month EMA.  Forcing a long-run breakout, therefore, is going to be an uphill task for the bulls – more so, as both the 5- and 10-month EMAs are still trending south, indicating a bearish setup. As a result, these averages – currently are located at $4,791 and $5,651, respectively – could work as stiff resistance levels.  View  An inverse head-and-shoulders breakout, if confirmed, would signal a major bullish reversal and could yield a quick move to the psychological hurdle of $5,000.  A break above the 21-month EMA of $5,567 could see in a long-run bullish breakout.

42430087,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMRAbh,1546856123,Colorado Senators File Bill to Exempt Cryptos from Securities Laws,"Two lawmakers from the U.S. state of Colorado have introduced legislation seeking to exempt cryptocurrencies and certain digital tokens from securities laws.  On Friday, senators Stephen Fenberg (Democrat) and Jack Tate (Republican) jointly filed a bill dubbed the “Colorado Digital Token Act,” proposing that digital tokens with a ""primarily consumptive” purpose should be exempted from securities laws provided they are not marketed for “speculative or investment” purposes.  The move is aimed to remove ""regulatory uncertainty"" that could hold back firms offering marketplaces for tokens and others aiming to fundraise using crypto assets.  Creating the Colorado Digital Token Act ""will enable colorado businesses that use cryptoeconomic systems to obtain growth capital to help grow and expand their businesses, thereby promoting the formation and growth of local companies and the accompanying job creation and helping make colorado a hub for companies that are building new forms of decentralized ""Web 3.0"" platforms and applications,"" the proposed bill states.  The consumptive purpose of digital tokens is defined as ""to provide or receive goods, services, or content, including access to goods, services, or content,"" according to the document.  To qualify for exemption, the consumptive purpose for a token must be available within 180 days of its sale or transfer and the initial buyer cannot resell or transfer the token until the consumptive purpose is available.  Further, the bill specifies: “The initial buyer provides a knowing and clear acknowledgment that the initial buyer is purchasing the digital token with the primary intent to use the digital token for a consumptive purpose and not for a speculative or investment purpose.”  For an exemption, an issuer must file a notice of intent with the state's securities commissioner, the bill adds.  In a similar development last month, two members of the U.S. House of Representatives filed the “Token Taxonomy Act,” a proposal also seeking to exclude digital tokens from being defined as securities.

42430088,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMRAXh,1546851623,Is the Window Closing on US Blockchain Leadership?,"The internet “should be a place where government makes every effort ... not to stand in the way, to do no harm,” said former President Clinton in 1997.  That was a precursor statement to the release of a seminal report by the U.S. government, called Global Framework for Electronic Commerce. Its central thesis was known as the “Do no harm” policy. It consisted of specific recommendations for not taxing, regulating, or restricting the (then) embryonic and key promise of the internet: global electronic commerce.  The report did not just prescribe a U.S. policy, but also called for all countries of the world to consider the same approach, because it was understood that electronic commerce had no boundaries, therefore its success was inter-dependent on global cooperation.  Historical precedent  Although more than 20 years old, that report is a fascinating read as context for the regulatory drama that is unraveling around the blockchain, today.  Had it not been for that policy, the U.S. could have created new taxes for e-commerce, limited it with new regulations, imposed duties, restricted the type of information transmitted, controlled standards of developments and imposed licensing requirements on service providers. Rightfully, none of that happened.  Without a doubt, that position was the right call. What followed this period was a massive explosion of growth in the U.S. around internet infrastructure, technologies and applications, arguably a significant contributing factor to why the U.S. spurted to super-power in internet related businesses, ahead of other countries.  For context, here are some noteworthy highlights from the report.    ""As use of the Internet expands, many companies and Internet users are concerned that some governments will impose extensive regulations on the Internet and electronic commerce.      Governments can have a profound effect on the growth of commerce on the Internet. By their actions, they can facilitate electronic trade or inhibit it. Knowing when to act and – at least as important – when not to act, will be crucial to the development of electronic commerce.    We should not assume, for example, that the regulatory frameworks established over the past sixty years for telecommunications, radio and television fit the Internet. Regulation should be imposed only as a necessary means to achieve an important goal on which there is a broad consensus. Existing laws and regulations that may hinder electronic commerce should be reviewed and revised or eliminated to reflect the needs of the new electronic age.""    Fast forward to 2019. Enter the blockchain.  Do or do not harm?  The analogies are striking, but the U.S. government and key regulatory bodies are lagging in decisive actions. They are not acknowledging that the blockchain shares similar characteristics to the internet and e-commerce of the mid-'90s.  Today, blockchain technology is still immature, so it needs to spread its wings further before being prematurely confined to a lower scope of impact.  Two years ago, in April 2016, then CFTC commissioner J. Christopher Giancarlo (now he is the chairman) gave an enlightening speech at the DTCC 2016 Symposium where he challenged regulators to heed the lessons of the internet and adopt a similar stance to the policy enumerated in the Global Framework for Electronic Commerce of 1997. He even suggested that regulators of all sides come together and agree on “uniform principles”, a brilliant idea.  Here are key passages from that speech:    ""Regulators have a choice in this regard. I believe we can either follow a regulatory path that burdens the industry with multiple onerous regulatory frameworks or one where we come together and set forth uniform principles in an effort to encourage Distributed Ledger Technology investment and innovation. I favor the latter approach.      Similarly, “do no harm” is the right approach for DLT. Once again, the private sector must lead and regulators must avoid impeding innovation and investment and provide a predictable, consistent and straightforward legal environment. Protracted regulatory uncertainty or an uncoordinated regulatory approach must be avoided, as should rigid application of existing rules designed for a bygone technological era.""    Unfortunately, judging by what actually happened since that speech, Chairman Giancarlo’s calls either fell on deaf ears or were not taken seriously; and not from a lack of goodwill on his part.  Unsurprisingly, the largest headwinds have come from the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), which has taken it upon itself to be the Grinch of blockchain regulation. They have stolen the lion’s share of the regulatory thunder, while throwing the baby out with the bath water.  Blockchain regulation is at risk of a “Do Harm” outcome, primarily based the SEC's approach.  Ray of hope?  More recently, on Dec. 20, 2018, Congressmen Davidson and Soto introduced a new bill, the Token Taxonomy Act (H.R. 7356), “To amend the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to exclude digital tokens from the definition of a security, to direct the Securities and Exchange Commission to enact certain regulatory changes regarding digital units secured through public key cryptography…”  That bill introduces a ray of hope that could potentially put a stick in the spokes of the SEC’s foolish trajectory.  Instead of leading with hope, optimism and open-mindedness, the SEC has been instilling fear into the markets by issuing a series of mixed actions, publishing unclear statements and sending cryptic messages via occasional speeches. They have divided and conquered the blockchain industry by stringing its participants along, without sharing any form of original thinking.  The SEC is stuck in the old paradigm of trying to classify all special-purpose cryptocurrencies (aka tokens, and a key blockchain invention) as securities by default, while being nebulous on what actually is a non-security.  At the macro level, the opposite of what took place in 1997 is actually unraveling today. In 1997, the U.S. led the world in thought and in practice, pertaining to electronic commerce regulation. Today, other nations are taking the lead at adopting progressive policies and regulatory implementations for blockchain technologies.  For example, the Japanese Financial Services Authority (FSA) has already received 190 cryptocurrency exchange licenses applications, and is currently reviewing them. Switzerland has published a well-defined token classification framework and continues to be a friendly jurisdiction for the “foundation” model to govern ICOs, having cracked the code on how to manage the process. Singapore, Gibraltar, Malta and Cayman Islands, although being smaller jurisdictions have also made positive strides, and are welcoming entrepreneurs with open arms.  This outburst of international activity is sending U.S. innovation overseas. Sadly, the U.S., known for the best tech startup ecosystem, finds itself handicapped and suffocated by unfriendly regulatory actions. These other jurisdictions have a legal advantage, but they cannot replicate the vibrancy and experience depths of the U.S. entrepreneurial environment.  The SEC could use a history lesson by reviewing the Global Framework for Electronic Commerce and its impact. By his own admission, incoming chairman Clayton noted he wasn’t asked about the blockchain during his confirmation hearings in March 2017, using that point to remind us of the topic’s novelty as the excuse for the SEC’s slow inertia with it. Meanwhile, the SEC continues to paint the sector with a broad brush, while not showing flexibility for change.  In contrast, the CFTC, which has had a markedly more advanced knowledge of the topic, is still trying to learn more, and recently published an RFI asking 25 questions about ethereum, the second most significant cryptocurrency after bitcoin.

42430094,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMRAph,1546837220,The Coming Bifurcation of Bitcoin,"Angus Champion de Crespigny is an advisor to blockchain projects and a former EY blockchain lead.  The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review.  Amongst many others, the bitcoin community for the past few years has been working with two particularly important ideas related to the asset’s future.  One is the narrative of institutional adoption: the idea that institutions will begin buying (or facilitating the buying) of bitcoin as an investment. The other is decentralization: emphasizing control of one’s own monetary sovereignty and the ease with which people can participate in the network at an affordable cost.  While both are important in their own ways, considering how institutions operate, it is likely that these two narratives are going to conflict. This does not need to be a problem, however. What we’re likely to see is a bifurcation in bitcoin usage throughout the world for different purposes, and consequently, how it is handled.  The Institutionalization of Bitcoin  This thesis comes from a number of different directions.  There is what I’ll call the “hard money” thesis: that bitcoin will be recognized as a superior form of money due to its monetary policy and will be adopted en masse by institutional investors. In this case, these investors are the likes of pension funds, endowment funds, insurers and, possibly, central banks.  Part of institutional adoption, however, is looking beyond the underlying benefits of the asset, and into whether there's an appetite for people to buy, sell, hold and trade bitcoin. Where there is an appetite for a financial asset, institutions will facilitate. In this case, the investors will also include individuals.  The challenge faced by institutions in working with bitcoin in either instance, though, is that financial instruments for institutions need to be boring. Institutions rarely custody their own assets. Over many years, custody functions have been centralized with specialized institutions in the financial sector, who will hold the assets and perform all management functions that are needed on behalf of the ultimate asset owners.  But for bitcoin, custody is challenging, and not just for the technical reason that private keys need to be secure.  How do institutions manage forks? Do they need a central clearing function to offset risk? How do they manage sanctions risks for transaction fees if a block is mined by a miner in a sanctioned country?  For institutions to hold the keys is rarely operationally sensible: few financial institutions have the expertise in-house nor have the appetite to take on such a technically complex process.  Consequently, for institutions to get on board with bitcoin, these issues will need to be addressed, and they will likely be addressed in the same way that the management of financial instruments usually are – with standards and centralized products. These standards may define what forks to accept and processes to follow to manage sanctions risks, which the industry will want to ensure is in line with peers to manage perceptions to clients and regulators.  Centralized products managed by specialized companies may include custodians and clearing houses: we’re starting to see this already.  While there is opposition to this centralization, and in particular how certain custodians manage forks, the reality is that few financial institutions, at least in the short term, have a desire to undertake this side of digital asset management. Many seasoned bitcoiners object to this centralization. And rightly so, at a technical level.  What’s the point in censorship resistant money if you standardize and centralize it such that it can be censored?  Censorship-Resistant Money  As recently covered in Time, bitcoin is effective for freedom because it allows people to store money away from a government they don’t trust. If there is a demand to keep money away from the government and bitcoin is effective in doing that, then naturally countries to which this is applicable will wish to restrict its usage.  We have already seen such controls with Zimbabwe and China. For such usage, bitcoin must be decentralized.  Centralized custodians, clearing houses, and standards organizations can be influenced by such jurisdictions through law enforcement and consequently will not be held up to be censorship resistant.  Now, if bitcoin for some reason is not effective as a tool for freedom, it is unlikely to adopted as such, in which case this whole discussion is moot. As much as I can probably assume that the reader is a fan of bitcoin and bullish for its eventual disruptive power, we should be pragmatic about the obstacles to it being adopted as a store of value.  It will need to significantly improve in its ease of use, particularly around key management. It will need a reduction in perceived volatility, and liquidity in these countries that need censorship resistant money, that by their nature likely have capital controls restricting money movement.  Ultimately, we will need a shift in perception to bitcoin being seen as a store of value on par with or superior to gold – which is no mean feat in itself. So while I’m optimistic we can get there, we may well have a long road.  If Bitcoin is successful in achieving this status, the logical conclusion is that we would expect bitcoin to hold a dual status globally. In countries where people have greater faith in the rule of law and central banks, censorship resistance is less attractive, and thus bitcoin could be seen as an investible commodity akin to gold with the majority of assets held in centralized institutions.  In parts of the world under oppressive regimes, however, bitcoin may be closer to an illegal or at the very least highly restricted asset, where there would need to be a greater emphasis and need of self-management of wallets and keys.  It would certainly be exciting if it was use in those countries that drove the price for the rest of the world.  Centralization of bitcoin products and services are not in and of themselves bad, as there will be a different demand for the asset from different markets. It is critical, however, that bitcoin at its base remains a decentralized, censorship-resistant medium of value transfer and storage: as without censorship resistance, we don’t have an innovation at all.

CoinDesk data shows bitcoin’s (BTC) price spiked $262 on Monday at 17:10 UTC to $4,063, a move accompanied by a large injection of volume.  At press time, bitcoin is up 5.95 percent over the last seven days, regaining losses seen toward the end of December.  Bitcoin’s market capitalization has also risen substantially, up $4 billion on the day to $70.73 billion, its highest point since Dec. 25. The move signals an expansion beyond the yearly low of $3,650 and an opportunity for the bulls to push higher this week, based on current price action and momentum.  Still, bitcoin is just one of many cryptocurrencies enjoying strong upside momentum with litecoin (LTC), NEO (NEO) and Cardano (ADA) leading the top 25, up 12.16, 10.6 and 9.11 percent respectively.

42430107,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMRAZh,1546822811,Ledger Crypto Wallet Goes Mobile With Bluetooth-Ready Nano X,"Ledger has gone mobile.  The crypto wallet company revealed its new, Bluetooth-enabled Nano X device Sunday at the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas.  The added Bluetooth means that the Nano X can readily be used with mobile devices, which has been a pain point for many users of the company's current wallet, the Ledger S. Much of the world primarily uses mobile computing, never or very seldom touching laptops or desktop computers.  ""The fact that we have a mobile application and it works with the Nano X is really the big evolution of the hardware for this lineup,"" Ledger CEO Eric Larchevêque told CoinDesk during a demonstration of the device.  By connecting the Nano X via Bluetooth, it's possible to have the security of Ledger but with mobile's form factor, Larchevêque said. (Ledger devices store keys but an external application on a computing device is needed to write and send transactions.)  When we spoke to Larchevêque, he wasn't ready to commit to a price for the Nano X but he did say that when it goes live, the price of the Nano S will drop (it currently sells for $69.99). According to the Ledger website, more than 1.3 million Nano S devices have been sold. (Update: Company reps tell CoinDesk the Nano X will retail for $119 in the U.S. and 119 euros in Europe.)  There's more to the new device, too. It has a slightly bigger screen, for example. (With such a tiny screen, every extra pixel helps with usability.) The screen is important because Ledger's approach to security requires that a lot of actions are made on the hardware device itself.  ""It's a more advanced device,"" Larchevêque said of the Nano X.  The Ledger Live mobile app will be available on Google Play and iTunes on Jan. 28, according to Ledger.  Many apps  To that end, it also has a lot more memory.  Memory might not seem that important for a hardware wallet. After all, it's just storing public private key pairs for each cryptocurrency a user holds, right?  Wrong. It turns out that as new tokens make the whole crypto ecosystem more complex, it becomes necessary for different software to interact with different protocols. To maintain Ledger's high security standards, the company made the decision that each protocol has to have its own app for sending and receiving coins.  ""We have lots of third-party developers who are developing applications,"" Larchevêque told CoinDesk. ""We want to make sure that these applications can only sign transactions for their own private key.""  This has an additional benefit, Larchevêque said. It means that a user with one app open can't accidentally sign a transaction to the wrong protocol.  The Ledger Nano X can store the apps for up to 100 crypto assets, a six-fold increase over the Nano S.  Vegas, baby  Ledger is making a statement by revealing its new device at CES.  ""It's true that CES is not a crypto show,"" Larchevêque said, acknowledging that his company has left the blockchain bubble with this appearance, but he points out that Ledger has gotten into the hands of too many users at this point to still be viewed as a niche device.  CES seems to have welcomed the French company into the broader world of consumer electronics. According to a press release from Ledger, CES awarded the Nano X with its 2019 ""Innovation Award in Cyber Security and Personal Privacy.""  Larchevêque said:  ""When you have more than a million customers you are really in consumer electronics.""
