The study analyzes the real-world transaction per second (TPS) performance of a range of large blockchain networks, both Ethereum-based and non-Ethereum (ETH) Virtual Machine (EVM) protocols. Solana Emerges As The Undisputed Speed Champion According to the findings, Solana has proven to be the fastest among large blockchains, with its actual daily average transactions per second (TPS) reaching a record high of 1,504 on April 6th, 202. Notably, this figure makes Solana 46 times faster than Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Furthermore, Solana’s TPS is more than 5 times faster than Polygonm (MATIC), which currently holds the highest TPS among Ethereum scaling solutions. Related Reading: Expert Sets Timeline For When Ethereum Price Will Begin Rally To $10,000 According to CoinGecko, this demonstrates the superior processing power of the non-EVM blockchain and its ability to handle a large influx of transactions, especially during periods of heightened market activity, such as the recent Memecoin mania, specifically within the Solana network. However, it’s important to note that despite Solana’s performance, the blockchain has only achieved 1.6% of its “theoretical maximum speed” of 65,000 TPS. This suggests that there is still significant room for improvement, and the network’s upcoming upgrades will be closely watched to see how quickly it can record even higher real TPS. Ethereum Scaling Solutions Lag Behind Non-EVM Blockchains The second-fastest blockchain in the study is another non-EVM protocol, Sui (SUI), which recorded its highest real TPS of 854 in July 2023 as the on-chain game Sui 8192 gained popularity. Other fast blockchains among the non-EVMs include The Open Network (TON) at 175 TPS and Near Protocol (NEAR) at 118 TPS. In contrast, the non-EVM blockchains that have recorded relatively lower real processing speeds are Aptos (49 TPS), Starknet (12 TPS), Bitcoin (11 TPS), and Thorchain (2 TPS). Collectively, the 8 non-EVM large blockchains have an average peak TPS of 284, which is 3.9 times faster than the 17 largest EVM and EVM-compatible blockchains, which have an average of just 74 TPS. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $100,000: Infamous Head And Shoulders Pattern Appears To Signal The Start Of Another Rally The EVM-compatible blockchain that has achieved the fastest real TPS is BNB Smart Chain (BSC), which recorded 378 TPS on December 7th, 2023, amid the surge in on-chain activity driven by the inscriptions craze. This performance places BSC as the fastest Ethereum-based blockchain, though it still lags behind the top non-EVM protocols. Similarly, the surge driven by inscriptions allowed Polygon to record 190 TPS on November 16th, 2023, making it the fastest among the largest Ethereum scaling solutions and 8.4 times faster than Ethereum itself. However, the leading non-EVM blockchains still outpacing even Polygon’s impressive speed. At press time, SOL was trading at $168, up nearly 7% in the last 24 hours and registering an impressive 720% gain year-to-date.

CryptoQuant’s CEO Foresees Bull Run Extending To 2025,"According to Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, the Bitcoin current market dynamics suggest a bullish phase that could extend well into April 2025. Ju’s analysis comes amid BTC’s current uptrend, which appears to be a continuation of that seen in March, when BTC achieved a new all-time high, surging above $73,000 for the first time. Related Reading: Analyst Utilizes Supply And Demand Principles To Determine Bitcoin Price Bitcoin Market Cap Growth Indicates Prolonged Uptrend, Says CryptoQuant CEO Notably, Ki Young Ju’s prediction stems from an analysis of Bitcoin’s market capitalization growth, which has been outpacing its realized capitalization — a measure of the market’s aggregate cost basis. This trend is a classic indicator of a strong bullish cycle and has been a reliable harbinger of sustained upward momentum in past market cycles. Ju’s analysis highlights that the market cap’s rapid growth compared to the realized cap suggests increased investor confidence and market momentum. This pattern has historically signaled prolonged bullish phases. If the current trends persist, this cycle is expected to continue, leading to significant gains in Bitcoin’s value over the next year and a half. #Bitcoin is in the middle of the bull cycle. Its market cap is growing faster than its realized cap, a trend that typically lasts around two years.

At the time of writing, it is trading around $67,201. Institutional Adoption And Market Sentiments Underpin Bullish Outlook The optimistic outlook for BTC is not just based on historical trends and market cap analysis. Recent developments in institutional adoption provide further support for this positive trajectory. Anthony Scaramucci, the founder and managing partner of SkyBridge Capital and a notable Bitcoin advocate, recently discussed on CNBC’s Squawk Box how US pension funds are beginning to invest in BTC. “When you do the homework on Bitcoin, you go towards Bitcoin…sometimes when you’re early you get some bumps and scrapes, but I think it pays to be early in Bitcoin and we are still early in Bitcoin,” says SkyBridge Capital’s Anthony Scaramucci. pic.twitter.com/HTfbwH5VJG — Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) May 16, 2024 This move by institutional investors, such as the State of Wisconsin Investment Board’s approximately $100 million investment in BTC, signals a broader acceptance and integration of BTC into traditional financial portfolios. Scaramucci emphasized that institutional BTC adoption is unfolding rapidly, and he anticipates more pension funds will pursue Bitcoin investments. He pointed out that regulatory approvals have opened the doors for large-scale institutional participation in BTC. This endorsement will make Bitcoin a staple in these institutions’ long-term asset allocation strategies. According to Scaramucci, understanding Bitcoin and the history of money is key to recognizing its potential.

After a period of consolidation, VET is experiencing a surge in investor confidence, buoyed by a recent price increase and positive technical indicators. However, analysts remain cautious, highlighting the inherent volatility of the crypto market and the need for a measured approach. Related Reading: Filecoin On Fire: Analyst Torches Doubters With $15 Target Resurgence And Resistance Since the top altcoin has been trading sideways for more than a month, investors are turning to other potentially profitable cryptocurrencies. But, the last 24 hours have offered a different perspective that could potentially change the narrative in favor of VeChain. In the last day, VET has defied the broader market malaise with a commendable 3% price increase. This resilience comes after encountering a crucial support level, indicating a potential reversal of its recent downtrend. Currently, VET faces a critical test at the $0.04 resistance level. A successful breakout above this barrier could propel the price further upwards, while a rejection could lead to a pause or even a downturn. Technicals Whisper Bullish, Analysts Take Cautious Note The recent price action has triggered bullish signals from technical analysts. The breakout from a “Falling Wedge” pattern, a technical indicator suggesting a trend reversal, has instilled optimism. Popular crypto analyst World of Charts has set a lofty target price increase of 500% in the coming weeks. $Vet Bouncing From Solid Support (Accumulation Zone Area) Successful Retest Can Lead Massive Bullish Wave In Coming Weeks Expecting 400-500% Bullish Wave#Crypto #Vet #Vechain pic.twitter.com/r2eryHNEDL — World Of Charts (@WorldOfCharts1) May 16, 2024 However, seasoned investors know that technical analysis is just one piece of the puzzle. The overall market sentiment and unforeseen events can significantly impact VET’s price trajectory. VET’s Long-Term Potential While the short-term price predictions paint a rosy picture, the true value of VET lies in its underlying technology. VeChain’s focus on supply chain solutions has attracted partnerships with major corporations like Walmart China and DNV GL. These collaborations demonstrate the real-world applications of VeChain’s blockchain platform and its potential to disrupt traditional supply chain management practices. Increased adoption of VeChain’s technology by businesses could translate to long-term growth for the VET token, regardless of short-term price fluctuations.

One of them is crypto expert Michaël van de Poppe, who believes Polkadot could rise to as high as $25 in this bull run. Polkadot Could Reach $25 On Next Leg Up Michaël van de Poppe mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Polkadot’s next rally will see it climb between $20 and $25. He explained that the crypto token has seen a substantial correction in the past months, but it showed enough strength by coming back to pre-rally levels. The analyst further claimed that Polkadot has bottomed, “especially since JAM Whitepaper came out.” Related Reading: PEPE Whales Go On Massive 720B Shopping Spree Amid Campaign For New ATHs, Is It Time To Get In? As such, he believes that Polkadot is more than primed for this rally, which could propel it to such heights. The crypto analyst has been a big believer in Polkadot’s potential. He previously included Polkadot in a list of crypto tokens that he believes are undervalued. He claimed that DOT’s valuation was still at a cycle low, which had opened up a “huge opportunity” to invest in it. Van de Poppe is very much invested in Polkadot because of its technology. In a previous X post, he highlighted how the JAM (Join-Accumualte Machine) Paper, which ushered in Polkadot 2.0, would revolutionize DOT’s ecosystem. He also claimed that Polkadot is the “second largest blockchain in terms of developers and growth.” Therefore, he expects DOT’s price to complement the team’s efforts soon enough. Meanwhile, Van de Poppe expects Polkadot to reach as high as $20 in the third quarter of this year. For now, he believes that the $8 and $17 range are crucial resistance levels that the crypto token must break out of to enjoy such a parabolic rally. A More Bullish Prediction For DOT Crypto analyst Crypto Thanos offered a more bullish prediction for Polkadot, stating that the crypto token climbing above $50 is “easily achievable” in this bull run. He believes this price is attainable because he expects institutions to get interested in large caps like Polkadot. He also noted Polkadot’s collaboration with Tie, which aims to increase institutional exposure and access. It is worth noting that Polkadot’s all-time high (ATH) is currently $55, which makes Thanos’ prediction for the crypto token feasible. Crypto tokens are known to usually surpass their ATH in every bull run.

The company is on track to become the largest bitcoin fund manager. This move reflects the changing landscape of financial markets and the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies. The time has changed. Markets move on. Firms move on. BlackRock moved into bitcoin exchange-traded funds just four months ago. Before the start of this year, BlackRock and many other ""major"" money players were not touching cryptocurrencies and were even speaking negatively about them and/or avoiding them altogether. Now, ""BlackRock is closing in on the crown of running the world's largest bitcoin fund.... ""The US group's spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund has gained $16.7 billion of assets since it launched four months ago, putting it at less than $1.0 billion behind market leader Grayscale, which enjoyed a 10-year and $28.0 billion head start."" ""Alongside that, BlackRock has launched the fastest-growing tokenized Treasury fund, which crypto hedge funds and market makers are beginning to use as collateral for trading coins and tokens."" But, this is a ""new"" BlackRock. Larry Fink, who, earlier on, called bitcoin ""an index of money-laundering."" Mr. Fink was not alone. Many, including Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase & Co., dismissed the space altogether. Given that the area was little understood, it was not surprising to have so many people dismiss the asset. What has changed? BlackRock's Chief Operating Officer Rob Goldstein is quoted as saying: ""It's all coming together now, but I would hope that it's understood that it's been a multi-year, very deliberate journey about bringing the same institutional quality that differentiates BlackRock to this ecosystem, and to us, that's more important than rushing."" The crypto world still has a ways to go...a lot of people to convince...and, accompanied by some stable financial times, with plenty of money around. So, the market appears to be building. More and more people...and managers...have become players. And, most important of all, more and more money is finding its way into the crypto-world. Cryptocurrencies are gaining acceptance in the real world of financial investment. And major players like BlackRock have taken notice of this fact. Cryptocurrencies are still not moving into the area that they, hopefully, were designed for. Cryptocurrencies are nowhere near to becoming a medium of exchange, something its originators wanted very badly. The originators wanted cryptocurrencies to eventually take the place of ""money"" and of digital currency. That is just not happening. Many still question whether it will ever become a real medium of exchange and whether it will ever replace other alternatives. But, cryptocurrencies are becoming more accepted as a ""store of value."" For one, the industry is still working hard to go speed up the settlement of deals and the transfer of funds. The move here is to make these assets ""more attractive to investors who want to access their money immediately."" The development and spread of blockchains throughout the financial system is a necessary advance that must be in place before things will pick up in this space. Blockchains will, eventually, allow individuals to settle deals in a matter of minutes. Then, lots of changes will evolve into the financial system. This, the true believers in the crypto world say, will happen in a matter of time. When the ""current technology"" ceases to keep up with the new advances, the technology will change. It has always been this way, and there is no reason to believe it won't happen in this case. The movement of BlackRock is part of the evidence that changes are taking place. Another piece of news presented in the article cited above states that ""Fidelity has followed behind in third place (behind BlackRock and Grayscale), attracting $9.3 billion of assets."" Competition is picking up. And, potential investors are listening. And, this is what the investor should listen to for the future. More and more ""bigger players"" will be moving into the market. The technology is changing. Marginal costs are falling. BlackRock is charging only a 0.25 percent fee on its product. Grayscale charges 1.5 percent. And, more and more information on the whole scene is growing, making people more comfortable with moving into the market. Furthermore, barring a major catastrophe, history shows that in innovative markets, the whole industry grows as people...investors...become more and more comfortable with what is being done. I still don't see the time when cryptocurrencies become a competitive medium of exchange. Other parts of the digital world will fill that space. I still continue to write a lot about the progress of digital currency throughout the world. People are not going to be lacking modern choices for building the structure of the money and financial world. To me, however, cryptocurrencies are going to have their little part of the world, but will not be a big part when it comes to providing a medium of exchange. As a potential investor in cryptocurrencies, be careful. Know what you are getting into. Certainly, with players like BlackRock and Fidelity joining the game and doing so well as to be numbers two and three in the field in terms of dollars invested, you, as an investor, would be participating in the market with some real creditable organizations. But, this market still is what it is. As much as the libertarians would like a ""money"" that was not governmentally created, managed, or, regulated, I just do not see this coming in the future. This means that cryptocurrencies will have to continue to justify their existence by being a store of value that has a market price. If that is the kind of asset that you, as an investor want, then go for it. So, let the market grow from here, and may those who want to ""invest"" in such a market be content with what evolves. As we are seeing, computer technology is changing the world...including the financial world...in many ways. This is the future. Investors must learn to live with new products and services coming to the marketplace at a very rapid pace. Some you will want to be a part of. Some you may not want to be a part of. Investors must do their homework...and then choose.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4694176-times-change-cryptocurrencies-gain-support?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/27991199.jpeg

42408163,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaBEof,1715973421,Does the SAB 121 Vote Mean Anything for Future Crypto Legislation?,"The U.S. Senate joined the House of Representatives in voting to repeal a controversial U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accounting rule that imposed burdensome capital requirements on crypto custodians. That’s a relatively big deal, considering the so-called Staff Accounting Bulletin, a.k.a. SAB 121, was one of the few things the crypto and banking industries have been aligned in opposing.  Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates. This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Unfortunately however, the legislative measure is now heading to the desk of President Joseph Biden, who has vowed to veto it in a show of solidarity with the SEC. Although a number of high profile Democrats, including New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, voted in favor of overturning the bulletin, the Senate’s 60 to 38 vote on Thursday failed to cross the threshold to override a presidential veto.  It’s hard to read the tea leaves of the vote, which almost suggests something of a realignment among legislators willing to pass decent crypto regulations (or at least repeal the bad). Then again, there are a number of reasons why it’d make sense to ditch SAB 121, not the least of which is that the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office found the SEC forced it through without proper congressional oversight.  Of course, perennially antagonistic crypto skeptic Sen. Elizabeth Warren voted to keep the rule in place, arguing “The unique risks of crypto can create liabilities that seriously impact a company's financial condition. SAB 121 simply clarifies how companies should account for those risks in their financial disclosures.” But still, is the bipartisan support a good sign for other legislative efforts, like the proposed stablecoin and market structure bills under consideration?  Views are split:  “Hate to be a downer here, but I don't think D support to rescind crypto accounting rule means a veto won't happen. I think the D 'ayes' on the anti-SBA 121 vote were cast because they know the White House is going to veto it. It's the cart, not the horse,” James Wester, director of crypto and co-head of payments at Javelin, said on X. Apparently it’s easier to vote for something you know will ultimately get showdown?  Meanwhile, Columbia Business School associate professor Austin Campbell said that Thursday’s vote proves that crypto is bipartisan. “This is a American issue, not a partisan one,” he said.  See also: Will Biden Get the Final Say Over a Controversial Crypto Rule? | Opinion  Whatever the case, it is worrying how precarious crypto legislation is. A rule that two pluralities vote in favor of, that is widely criticized by industry actors and has even been called “idiotic” by knowledgeable actors like Nadine Chakar, often called one of the most important women in finance who helped found State Street Digital and is now running DTCC’s crypto unit, (and who is speaking at Consensus 2024), will likely remain in place.  This isn’t even just purely an academic issue, because the SAB 121 – though technically “nonbinding” – is already having an effect on financial institutions ability to enter into the crypto custody business, according to an open letter signed by the Bank Policy Institute (BPI), American Bankers Association (ABA), Financial Services Forum (FSF) and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) in February.  See also: Crypto Industry Rallies Behind U.S. House Bill As it Heads to Final Vote  I mean, this is a bit of a counterfactual, but how far advanced would sectors like stablecoins and interbank blockchain rails be had clear regulations been written years ago? It seems trivially true that regulatory uncertainty (and more recently, hostility) has prevented firms from experimenting with crypto. For instance, certainly some big custodians would be interested in custodying all that ETF bitcoin, as Fortune’s Jeff John Roberts recently wrote.  It’s interesting that 12 Dems in the Senate could come together to help vote down a harmful rule, but I’m not sure the SAB 121 story is really all that encouraging.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/17/does-the-sab-121-vote-mean-anything-for-future-crypto-legislation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/097e3de6856cdaa4027360cd71ac2e8e5772d035-1602x900.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company recorded net losses of $53.1 million, a significant decline from the previous year's net income figure. MicroStrategy saw growth in revenue from subscription services and increased its Bitcoin holdings, but its overall performance reflects weaknesses and investors should be very cautious. The stock has shown historical inabilities to sustain major rallies, and the volatility levels associated with MSTR make this a dangerous stock to hold in conservative portfolios. MicroStrategy (MSTR) is widely known for its seemingly “all-in” Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) outlook, but recent earnings figures show that the company might have little else to offer investors other than indirect access to the cryptocurrency market. During the first-quarter period, MicroStrategy reported revenues of $115.2 million, which missed analyst estimates of $121.73 million and indicated declines in annualized growth rates of 5.5%. Additionally, the company recorded per-share net losses of $3.09 (or $53.1 million), marking a massive decline from the per-share net income figure of $31.79 (or $461.2 million) that was achieved during the same period last year. Q1 2024 Revenue and Billings (MicroStrategy) Gross margins also dropped to 74% (down from 77.1% a year earlier) and gross profits posted at $85.2 million for the period. Furthermore, impairment losses from digital assets ($191.6 million) caused substantial increases in MicroStrategy’s operating expenses, which rose by an alarming 152.8% on an annualized basis (at $288.9 million). Quarterly Figures (MicoStrategy) On the positive side, MicroStrategy did see growth improvements in its revenue from subscription services, which saw annualized gains of 22% (at $23 million), while cash and equivalents rose from $46.8 million during the prior quarter to $81.3 million. At the same time, digital asset carrying values came in just above $5 billion, affected by nearly $2.5 billion in impairment losses (cumulative). In light of these performance results, MicroStrategy CFO Andrew Kang explained: In the first quarter we raised over $1.5 billion by executing again on our capital markets strategy including two successful convertible debt offerings. We acquired 25,250 additional Bitcoins since the end of the fourth quarter, our 14th consecutive quarter of adding more Bitcoin to our balance sheet. We believe that the combination of our operating structure, Bitcoin strategy, and focus on technology innovation provides a unique opportunity for value creation for our shareholders. Year to date, the price of Bitcoin appreciated significantly, spurred notably by the approval of the spot Bitcoin exchange traded products which has increased institutional demand and resulted in further regulatory clarity. All of that said, our view is that these quarterly performances reflect significant weaknesses within the company as a whole and that investors looking to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency market would be better-off simply buying the cryptocurrencies themselves. Overall, our view of the space remains bullish, and we have written a recent research analysis article on BTC-USD (which can be found here for a more in-depth explanation of our cryptocurrency stance). However, we feel that adding a “middleman” to this equation unnecessarily complicates matters, and when we are seeing a clear deterioration in most quarterly performance results (such as those shown in MicroStrategy’s most recent earnings figures) we think that MSTR must be viewed with extreme caution and should be sold on all rallies. MSTR: Monthly Chart (Income Generator via TradingView) In most of our trading strategies, we tend to believe that market assets will ultimately revert to the mean - at least, at some stage. Looking at the monthly chart shown above, we can see that MSTR share valuations can really only be characterized as extremely volatile. Needless to say, this is the type of stock that has no place in a conservative investment portfolio, as major rallies tend to be very short-lived and vulnerable to sizable selling pressures once they occur. As an example, we can point to the long candle wicks that formed in February 2021 and again in March 2024. In our view, these types of candlestick formations point to extreme volatility, and these scenarios tend to become most obvious during MSTR rallies (rather than declines). MSTR: Weekly Chart (Income Generator via TradingView) On the positive side, we do see some evidence of potential support zones forming in the $1,080 region (although arriving at specific price levels does become much more difficult when dealing with an asset that is characterized by such high levels of volatility). In this instance, we can see that prior areas of resistance will be expected to work as strong levels of support in the future, and we can see a clear example of this type of price behavior in April 2024. Here, MSTR share prices managed to find enough buying activity to prevent sustained declines below the $1,000 level - and this is the main price zone we will be watching going forward. Overall, we would expect declines to accelerate if this support zone is breached to the downside, as this would suggest prior bulls in this region have declined in number. Fibonacci Retracement Levels (Income Generator via TradingView) As long as the aforementioned price support remains intact, we still see scope for additional rallies in MSTR share prices. However, given the stock’s longstanding inability to hold sustainable rallies, we will continue looking for potential resistance levels that can be used to establish short positions (or close pre-existing long positions). To accomplish this, we can use Fibonacci retracement levels as an approach to defining future resistance zones. If we conduct this analysis using the March 2024 price highs of $1,999.70 and extend this move to the May 2024 price lows of $1,009.89, we can see that the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement (located at $1,244.90) and the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement (located at $1,389.19) have already been breached. Thus far, the 50% retracement of the aforementioned price move (located just above $1,500) has contained upside momentum and acted as strong resistance. However, if this level is broken, the next upside targets will become the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement (located near $1,620) and the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement (located just below $1,790 per share). Given recent weaknesses that have become visible in MicroStrategy’s quarterly earnings figures and the long-term inability this stock has experienced in attempting to sustain significant price rallies, we believe that investors should be looking for potential levels to sell MSTR when these types of upside price moves are seen. Currently, we see potential for share prices to continue moving higher as long as our downside pivot point remains intact. However, a downside breach of this area could lead to substantial bearish volatility, as this would suggest that a prior level of strong support would no longer be valid. On the whole, we maintain our positive stance on the cryptocurrency market in broad terms, but we do not see much need for investors to gain exposure to this space using vehicles like MSTR. On its own, the stock’s history of extreme volatility should be viewed as dangerous for investors with conservative portfolio strategies, and we recommend selling this stock during any significant rallies in share prices.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4694163-microstrategy-dangerous-stock-sell-all-rallies-technical-analysis?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/27989941.jpeg

27989270,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608626,1715972431,Bitcoin Whales Quiet Down – Here’s Why And What It Means For The Market,"Recent data from Santiment indicates a noticeable decrease in Bitcoin whale activity, reaching the lowest levels seen in 2024. This trend shows that holders of large amounts of Bitcoin, known as whales, are drifting away from active trading. While this could signal a negative trend, the situation presents a complex picture of the cryptocurrency’s market dynamics. Despite the fall in whale activity, the total number of Bitcoin wallets with at least 100 BTC remains high, at 11.79 million BTC across 15,907 wallets. Historically, increased activity from these large holders has often preceded significant price movements in Bitcoin, suggesting that their current quiet could lead to various market outcomes. The question remains: What does this reduced activity mean for the market’s future? Related Reading: Is Bitcoin’s Rally Over? Top Analysts Predict Imminent Price Corrections Analyzing Whale Activity: What This Means For Bitcoin A decline in whale activity could initially be interpreted as an indicator of lower market volatility. Significant moves by these large holders can profoundly affect Bitcoin’s price, often resulting in abrupt and unforeseen fluctuations. 🐳 While #Bitcoin‘s 100+ $BTC whale wallets continue to hold a high level of coins (11.79M), whale activity has dropped to its lowest level of 2024. There are currently 15,907 wallets holding at least 100 coins. It would be a #bullish sign if this rises. https://t.co/nldtOms3aT pic.twitter.com/Lyj4Epfp9a — Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 16, 2024 Consequently, a diminished presence of whales might lead to much market stability and predictability in the near term. However, this stability might contradict the typical trading behavior associated with crypto, where volatility often presents trading opportunities. Moreover, if these whales hold onto their Bitcoin rather than sell, this behavior could be interpreted as a long-term bullish signal. It suggests that these influential market players see the potential for future price increases and are choosing to hold their positions. This perspective is reinforced by the current trading price of Bitcoin, which is above $66,000, marking a nearly 5% increase over the past week. Indicator Shows Further Surge Ahead Adding to the analysis, Willy Woo, a prominent crypto analyst, discussed the latest trends in the BTC volume-weighted average price (VWAP) Oscillator. The VWAP is a trading benchmark that measures an asset’s average price based on price and volume over a specific period. This metric prioritizes price levels with higher trading volumes, offering a more comprehensive view of market trends. Woo’s analysis revealed that the Bitcoin VWAP Oscillator has been in negative territory for several months but has recently started to rise. The oscillator could soon reach a neutral point if this upward trend continues.

42408166,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaBF1t,1715969927,Miners Eye Middle East as Next Region for Growth,"The Biden Administration's proposed 30% tax on electricity use for digital asset mining operations is raising concerns among crypto miners that they could be priced out of operating in the U.S. market communities.  Crypto miners in the United States represent over 29% of the total nodes on the Bitcoin network. But that percentage may fall if costs increase and other locations become more attractive.  One emerging option is the Middle East region, where taxes tend to be lower, energy is often bountiful, and environmental regulation is generally less onerous.  The Oman government has invested more than $800 million in crypto-mining operations. The UAE’s 400 megawatts of Bitcoin mining is about 4% of the global Bitcoin mining hashrate, according to data from the Hashrate Index. Migration to the energy-rich region could favor U.S miners, backers in the region claim.  “Compared to the U.S., the south of Oman has a few geopolitical advantages that are unique. It is very good for connections, as it’s next to submarine cables landing. It has, low [cost] electricity, reduced political risk, and favorable weather conditions for data centers,” said Olivier Ohnheiser, CEO of Green Data City, an Oman crypto-mining firm, told CoinDesk during Bitmain’s World Digital Mining Summit in Oman at the end of March.  Green Data City last year struck a $300 million deal with Phoenix Group – the largest digital asset mining firm in the UAE – to set up a 150-megawatt crypto farm in Salalah, southern Oman. The plant, for Bitcoin, Litecoin, and other POW crypto assets, is set to be completed later this year . Salalah reaches highs of 27 degrees centigrade (81 degrees F) in summer months, but that’s relatively cool compared to the rest of the Middle East), and the region has access to cool ocean water and is underpinned by Green Data City’s operational mining license.  Also in 2023, Digital Marathon (MARA) and the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund-backed Zero Two signed a $406 million joint venture to build the first immersion-cooled Bitcoin mining plant in the Middle East region. While temperatures in the desert are a drawback, particularly in the summer months when highs of 50 degrees centigrade are not unusual, the cooling technology allows the mining equipment to function optimally even in challenging environments.  The United States’ continued regulatory crackdown on crypto business might also boost regional growth for the Middle East.  Kyle Shneps, Director of Public Policy at Foundry, a U.S.-based crypto mining firm, expects a drop in crypto mining in the U.S. if the electricity tax bill is passed.  “A 30% tax on the electricity used by bitcoin miners would assuredly kill the industry in the United States. It would be unprecedented to have such attacks on the electricity used, and I think. It sets a really dangerous precedent,” he said.  In a similar vein, Darin Feinstein, founder of mining firm Core Scientific, believes that the bill could hurt the U.S. economy.  “This is a tax question I believe. I do not believe this has any likelihood of passing, but if it did it would simply weaken the American footprint on the most important asset in our lifetime. Investment and technology would simply leave our shores for more hospitable environments,” he said.  With the looming taxation bump and reduced block rewards due to the recent Bitcoin halving in April, miners are grappling with changed economics. Seyed Mohammad Alizadehfard (Bijan), Co-Founder and Group CEO at the Phoenix Group, cites this as another factor that could influence the choices of U.S.-based miners.  “At any given point of price, when you carve supply in half, the price needs to appreciate or it will be very hard for Bitcoin miners with high electricity prices or older generation machines. If this [U.S.] bill passes, some mining firms could migrate to places like the Middle East where such laws don’t exist yet,” he said.  But Skybridge Capital’s Anthony Scaramucci, a former White House comms director, believes the United States remains a hotbed for digital assets, including mining.  “Despite regulatory uncertainty, the U.S. offers an ecosystem that is ripe for innovation and growth, with many of the leading crypto firms and projects already here,” he told CoinDesk.  If the new electricity tax bill for digital asset mining passes, U.S.-based miners have two options, cling to the U.S. market and make the numbers work, or find a new home.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Lorna Blount ,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/05/17/miners-eye-middle-east-as-next-region-for-growth,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/75aa6959033547fed0915504b001107272c07267-1000x611.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

27986691,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608595,1715968835,Chainlink Becomes Crypto Winner With 21% Rally: What’s Driving This?,"Chainlink (LINK) has enjoyed a sharp surge of more than 21% over the past 24 hours. Here’s what data suggests could be behind this rally. Chainlink Has Surprised Crypto Market With Breakout In The Past Day While most cryptocurrency sectors have seen flat or small green returns over the last 24 hours, Chainlink has shown a decoupling as it has observed some sharp bullish momentum in this window. Related Reading: Bitcoin Still Has “A Lot Of Room To Run Before Reversal,” Says Top Analyst Here is a chart that displays how LINK’s recent performance has looked like: With this sudden burst, Chainlink has touched the $16.7 mark for the first time since the crash during the first half of April. While the asset has now retraced a major part of this plunge, it still hasn’t made a full recovery. Should LINK’s bullish momentum continue, though, it may not be too long before the cryptocurrency can reclaim the $17.8 level it was trading at just before the crash. As for where Chainlink stands in the wider market, the table below shows that, based on market cap, it’s currently the 15th largest coin. LINK isn’t too far off from Polkadot (DOT) now, so it’s possible that if the price rise continues, the coin will dethrone DOT and take over the 14th spot on the list. Now, what could be the reason for Chainlink’s sudden decoupling from the rest of the market? Data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment may perhaps provide some hints. The Total Number Of LINK Whales Is At A 6-Month High Now As pointed out by Santiment in a post on X, Chainlink investors holding 100,000 tokens or more of the asset in their balance have recently seen their address count increase. This cutoff is equivalent to around $1.67 million at the current LINK exchange rate. Investors with holdings this large are popularly referred to as whales. Whales can be influential entities in the market because they can move a large amount of volume in a short span of time. As such, their behavior may be worth monitoring. From the graph, it’s visible that Chainlink’s total number of whale addresses has hit 564 after the latest rise, which is the highest the metric has been since October of last year. This increase in the number of whales on the network may be partially behind the surge that LINK has just seen. In the same chart, the analytics firm has also attached the data for another indicator: social dominance. This metric tells us about the share of cryptocurrency-related social media discussions that LINK occupies right now. Related Reading: XRP & Cardano Whales Load Up Bags: Preparation For Altcoin Rally? This indicator has shot up alongside this rally, implying the interest around the coin has spiked. Historically, such a rise in attention has been a bearish sign for the asset, so it remains to be seen if these high values will be maintained. “If social dominance calms and FOMO doesn’t take over, bullish conditions are ahead,” notes Santiment.

27984006,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608600,1715965217,"Expert Sets Timeline For When Ethereum Price Will Begin Rally To $10,000","A crypto analyst has made a daring prediction for Ethereum (ETH), setting the timeline for when the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency would embark on a significant rally to new all-time highs above $10,000. Here’s When Ethereum Will Reach $10,000 A crypto analyst identified as ‘Yoddha,’ on X (formerly Twitter) has announced the timeline for Ethereum’s ascent above $10,000. According to Yoddha, Ethereum is expected to rally massively after a period of accumulation and decline, continuously rising above $10,000 by the end of the year. Related Reading: Why Did The Bitcoin Price Rise Above $66,000 Today? The analyst’s ambitious predictions are based on historical trends exhibited by Ethereum from 2016 to 2024. He shared a chart depicting Ethereum’s price action over these years, highlighting periods of accumulation, interim peaks and volatility. Yoddha disclosed that from 2019 to 2021, Ethereum witnessed a period of accumulation marked by multiple price fluctuations, including long declines and short rallies. Following this, Ethereum surged significantly, reaching a peak of $4,867 towards the end of 2021. This price range aligns with the cryptocurrency’s all-time high of $4,878, achieved during the previous bull market cycle in 2021. Based on these historical trends, Yoddha identified a similar accumulation phase in Ethereum’s price movements during this current market cycle. The analyst noted that from 2022 to early 2024, Ethereum experienced an accumulation and slightly bearish phase. Prior to reaching a record high of $4,088 on March 12, 2024, Ethereum had experienced a bearish trend in 2022 and 2023. The cryptocurrency also faced declines on several occasions in 2024, especially around April and May. Yoddha has indicated that Ethereum has successfully concluded this accumulation and bearish period and is on track to witness a massive rally towards $15,346, extending into the end of 2024. Analyst Says ETH Could Start Altcoins Season In another X post, Yoddha indicated that Ethereum could start the upcoming altcoins season. The crypto analyst has consistently emphasized the impending launch of the highly anticipated altcoins season in 2024. He revealed that altcoins will begin to gain more attraction once the hype surrounding meme coins diminishes. Additionally, Yoddha revealed that 2024 could issue the biggest altcoins season, encompassing healthy pullbacks and new all-time highs. Related Reading: End Of The Road For BNB After 200% Surge? Mounting Resistance Threatens Rally Presently, the price of Ethereum is trading at $3,024, reflecting a 1.58% decline over the past month, according to CoinMarketCap.

Crypto analyst, Ali Martinez has revealed that currently, Ethereum’s TD Sequential is presenting a “buy signal” on ETH’s daily price chart.

The layer-2 blockchain has $141 million in total value locked (TVL).  Zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup zkSync has suggested that a governance token airdrop will take place at the end of June.  There have been murmurs of an airdrop since March last year when investors bridged over $8 million worth of tokens to zkSync in order to be eligible. Total value locked (TVL) since then has risen to $141 million, according to DefiLlama.  ""The upcoming release of v24 is the final planned protocol upgrade needed before handing over network governance to the community. The remaining missing pieces are expected to be in place by the end of June,"" zkSync wrote on X.  ZkSync is a layer-2 network designed to scale Ethereum, providing cheaper transactions by performing computation and storing data off-chain; taxonomically speaking, it's classified as a sub-type of layer-2 known as a ZK rollup, which relies on zero-knowledge cryptography, seen as one of the most promising new technologies in blockchain.  Transaction fees became significantly cheaper in following Ethereum's Dencun upgrade in March, which allowed layer-2 networks like zkSync to compress transactions before sending them in batches to the Ethereum mainnet.  The planned issuance of a governance token comes after a series of airdrops over the past year with the likes of EigenLayer, Renzo, Ethena and Wormhole opting to rewards early adopters as opposed to traditional token sales.

The coin is retesting $66,000 at spot rates, but traders expect the breakout to have been confirmed, pushing BTC prices toward $70,000. Since the surge to all-time highs in March, the coin has been on a steady downtrend, as shown in the formation on the daily chart. BTC Liquidity Is High Despite Accumulation: Analyst Therefore, as doubt creeps in, Willy Woo, a Bitcoin on-chain analyst, is calming down market participants, saying the coin is preparing for sharp gains in the days ahead. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Price Explosion To Over $18 Though prices are flat-lining in the daily chart, what’s important to note, Woo says, is the level of liquidity. Sharing a chart on X, Woo emphasized Bitcoin’s position within its liquidity cycle. The Bitcoin liquidity cycle is simply a chart showing the boom and bust periods of the world’s most valuable coin. Every cycle in history is highly influenced by the availability and flow of capital in and out of the asset. The analyst is upbeat, arguing that though prices are down from all-time highs and appear stuck in a consolidation, the coin is still in a “warm-up” phase. Woo adds that the current consolidation period means the long-term risk is low in light of the relatively high liquidity. Comparing the current state of affairs to past price action, the analyst predicts that Bitcoin prices will likely surge. When “the floodgates open” and new capital enters the market, prices will shoot higher, but so will risk. Bitcoin Uptrend Just Getting Started? Ki Young Ju, the founder of CryptoQuant, a crypto analytics platform, has supported Woo’s position. To X, Ju said Bitcoin is in the middle of a bull cycle. To explain this view, the founder noted that Bitcoin’s capitalization has been growing faster than the realized cap. The realized cap is a metric that aims to gauge the total value of all coins in circulation based on the price at which they were last moved. This trend has persisted for roughly two years historically. If this pattern holds, the bull cycle could end by April 2025. Related Reading: Did A Dogecoin Whale Just Sink The DOGE Ship?

27978712,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608593,1715958025,Analyst Utilizes Supply And Demand Principles To Determine Bitcoin Price,"For analysts and investors alike, comprehending the variables that influence price action in the complex world of cryptocurrency markets is essential. Ali Martinez, a well-known cryptocurrency expert, has recently provided insights into the fluctuations in the price of Bitcoin by applying the basic economic theory of supply and demand. Understanding Bitcoin Prices Through Supply And Demand It is worth noting that any asset’s price movement, including cryptocurrencies, is determined by the fundamental rules of supply and demand. An asset’s price tends to decrease when supply outpaces demand, while prices typically increase when supply cannot keep up with demand. Related Reading: The Hidden Forces Behind Bitcoin Price: Latest Insights From On-Chain Data Thus, Ali Martinez has deduced the crypto asset’s price and holders’ behaviour by applying the method and other on-chain metrics. Martinez’s analysis demonstrates how fluctuations in the market’s buying interest and the availability of Bitcoin are key factors influencing its price trajectory. According to Martinez, Bitcoin’s Realized Cap witnessed a significant increase mid-way through March when BTC hit a new all-time high of $73,000. This indicated that the majority of BTC’s long-term holders were likely yielding gains at the time. As a result, several investors sold their holdings, which led to a sharp rise in realized profits. Following realized profits in March, long-term holders felt safe adding over 70,000 BTC to their investments at these prices. Meanwhile, when the market’s growing supply of Bitcoin exceeded demand, the coin saw a substantial correction from the $73,000 level to the $57,000 level. Given that short-term holders are more likely to sell their holdings due to price volatility, this decline took Bitcoin below its realized price for short-term holders, inciting fear in the market. However, despite investors’ concerns, the short-term holder’s Realized Price at the $65,500 level acted as an accumulation point. On the basis of this principle, Martinez believes the likelihood of Bitcoin continuing its upward trajectory will only increase when demand for the cryptocurrency starts to exceed the supply of BTC accessible in the market. Using BTC On Exchanges To Support The Principles Martinez has underscored that the available BTC on crypto exchanges can be used to confirm these supply and demand laws. He further noted that over 30,000 BTC have been moved to private wallets for long-term storage in May, indicating confidence among holders in the potential worth of Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Accumulating Like In 2021: Is BTC Ready For A 15X? Observing Bitcoin’s price using the MVRV Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands, Martinez cited a retracement above the +0.5σ pricing band at $64,600. Such an upswing has historically caused BTC to test the pricing range of 1.0σ, which is backed by increasing demand. Meanwhile, this price range at the moment is roughly lingering at $77,000. Presently, the price of Bitcoin is trading at $66,275, indicating an over 5% increase in the past week. Although prices are up, its trading volume has declined by 24%, while its market cap is up by 0.23%.

42408177,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaBFP2,1715957055,Crypto Industry Rallies Behind House Bill as It Heads Toward Final Vote,"A wide swath of the crypto industry signed a letter to the top lawmakers in the U.S. House of Represenatives, explaining why they should get behind the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act.  As House lawmakers are poised for a floor vote next week on the bill, the letter says passage would help the U.S. keep up with global competitors.  The U.S. House of Representatives is on the verge of a vote that will represent the closest the cryptocurrency industry has ever been toward finally winning regulation in the U.S., and the sector's associations and top businesses are encouraging House leaders to support the effort.  Through the Crypto Council for Innovation, a coalition of digital assets organizations and companies, including Coinbase, Kraken, Andreessen Horowitz, the Digital Currency Group and about 50 others, wrote a letter to Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), advocating for passage of the bill. The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) has been authorized for floor time next week, where observers are hoping to see a mid-week vote.  The bill would set the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as a leading regulator of digital assets, and it sets out clear divisions for what the CFTC will handle and what would fall under the reach of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It would establish consumer protections – including rules around custody of customers' assets and their treatment in bankruptcy – and set up further guardrails against risky behavior.  ""By passing this legislation, we can accelerate the growth of blockchain technology and digital assets, fostering financial inclusion and protecting national security,"" according to the letter. ""It is crucial for the U.S. to maintain its leadership in financial innovation.""  The crypto industry is on a high in Washington at the moment, having watched both the House and Senate easily pass a resolution overturning a crypto accounting policy from the SEC, though President Joe Biden vowed to veto the effort. That move to erase the SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121) represented a fight that went decidedly in the industry's favor, drawing many supporters from the Democratic Party that's been more reticent than Republicans in backing crypto.  For that accounting tussle, more than one in five Senate Democrats voted on the industry's side, including Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), and it was about one in 10 Democrats in the House.  But the comprehensive legislation now approaching a House vote is of a much higher magnitude, and key Senate Democrats have so far seemed unprepared to match the House's effort. To date, the Senate has only shown a potential willingness to fit a different crypto bill – one regulating stablecoin issuers – into a package deal with other financial legislation.  Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee where the bill was launched, said the level of Democratic support for FIT21 in the House could be a major factor in whether the Senate is moved to action.

This bullish pattern indicates another rally may be on the horizon for the flagship crypto, which could send its price to $100,000. How Could Bitcoin Could Rise To $100,000 Crypto Jebb revealed in a video on his YouTube channel that the inverse heads-and-shoulders pattern he had been predicting for a while had finally formed on the charts. He predicts this pattern could lead to a price breakout, sending Bitcoin’s price to $70,000. The analyst also noted that the price target of the bullish pattern is at $75,000, which indicates that Bitcoin could hit a new all-time high (ATH) on its next leg up. Related Reading: End Of The Road For BNB After 200% Surge? Mounting Resistance Threatens Rally Crypto Jebb mentioned that there is a “great degree of likelihood” that Bitcoin would experience a major rally, which would send it to $100,000 should it break its current ATH of $73,800. The crypto analyst believes that Bitcoin’s rise to that price level is very likely, considering that it has seen a “pretty large corrective movement” since hitting a new ATH over two months ago. The crypto analyst warned that there is a scenario where Bitcoin could also end up trading sideways between $60,000 and $64,000, which would signal a period of consolidation. He noted that Bitcoin could even drop lower during this period. However, Bitcoin’s outlook is generally bullish based on the technical indicators that crypto Jebb highlighted. The analyst highlighted the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD), which he noted is turning “very bullish” on the daily chart and shows that the bulls are regaining control. He also claimed that Bitcoin is witnessing a ‘green red green’ formation on the daily chart, indicating that the crypto token is “doing very well.” BTC Is In “Very Bullish Territory Crypto Jebb mentioned that Bitcoin is currently in very bullish territory, especially since Altcoins are also rallying. He claims this indicates a “great degree of confidence” in the market at the moment. The crypto analyst also noted that the stock market just broke an all-time high, which he stated is big news for Bitcoin. Related Reading: PEPE Whales Go On Massive 720B Shopping Spree Amid Campaign For New ATHs, Is It Time To Get In? He explained that this is big news for Bitcoin because the flagship crypto follows the stock market and moves significantly whenever the stock market experiences a breakout. As such, with the stock market breaking its ATH, he expects Bitcoin to do so soon enough. Crypto Jebb further explained that the rationale behind Bitcoin following the stock market is that investors are more confident in investing in risk-on assets when they see that the risk-off (the stock market) is doing so well. Crypto Jebb predicts that Bitcoin will become a risk-off asset in the next ten to twenty years. When that happens, he predicts that hundreds of billions of dollars in investment will be made in the flagship crypto.

An EVM is a smart contract-executing software that powers the Ethereum protocol, similar to an operating system on a computer.  Bitfinity is attempting to capture the interest in new Bitcoin protocol Runes, which launched around a month ago coinciding with the halving event, through introducing smart contract capability in order to use them as a platform to create Bitcoin DeFi apps.  Runes, which allows fungible tokens to be minted on the Bitcoin blockchain, immediately sent network fees soaring following a flurry of activity following its launch.

42408169,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaBF8V,1715950108,Binance Exec Tigran Gambaryan Denied Bail by Nigerian Court,"Tigran Gambaryan’s bail was refused by a Nigerian court on Friday.  Nigeria has taken Binance and its executives to court and is pursuing tax evasion and money laundering charges.  Detained Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan’s bail application was denied by a Nigerian court on the grounds that there is a likelihood that he will manage to jump bail, the spokesperson for the executive’s family said on Friday.  Binance and the executives’ money laundering, tax evasion and the exchanges detained Head of Compliance Tigran Gambaryans bail hearings all occurred on Friday in Nigeria. The court ruled that Binance can be served with the Federal Inland Revenue Service tax evasion charge through Gambaryan.  Tigran’s lawyers objected to the application on the grounds that they needed to review the amended charge to advise Gambaryan on taking his plea. The court agreed to adjourn the matter to May 22 for arraignment, where charges are formally laid against the defendant.  Gambaryan, who turned 40 on Friday, has been detained in Nigeria since February when he arrived with the British-Kenyan regional manager for Africa, Nadeem Anjarwalla. Anjarwalla has since escaped.  “I truly cannot believe that my innocent husband is now - on his 40th birthday - having to face a trial for charges that he has nothing to do with,” said Yuki Gambaryan, the wife of Tigran Gambaryan.  “The whole world is watching what he is being put through, and I just pray that common sense and justice will prevail and that Tigran will be allowed to come home to us.”  A month after the exchange’s executives were detained in the country, they, along with the exchange, were charged with money laundering and tax evasion. Gambaryan was later moved to Kuje prison, which also houses the likes of members of the Boko Haram terrorist group.  Nigeria’s Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) money laundering trial commenced on Friday with a Nigerian prosecutor who called on Abdulkadir Abbas from the Nigerian SEC as the first prosecution witness.  After the prosecution finished examining their first witness, Tigran’s lawyers asked for a stand down—which means to put a matter on hold for a short while—to obtain certified records of certain documents in the proof of evidence to be used in their cross-examination of the witness. The court adjourned the trial until May 23 at noon.  “We are deeply disappointed that Tigran Gambaryan, who has no decision-making power in the company, continues to be detained. Tigran has been dedicated to public service and fighting crime for most of his life. These charges against him are completely meritless. He should be freed while discussions continue between Binance and Nigerian government officials,"" a Binance Spokesperson said.  Binance’s CEO Richard Teng recently released a blog post calling on the Nigerian government to release Gambaryan.

The proposed law aims to introduce a licensing scheme for crypto firms, which will be handled by the CMB  Türkiye has introduced a legislative proposal aimed at reducing the risks of parties transacting with crypto assets in the country. The proposal has been presented to the parliament.  The bill, introduced by ruling party chairman Abdullah Güler, includes various regulations regarding crypto assets and will be implemented by the Capital Markets Board (CMB). This proposal establishes important rules regarding crypto service providers and increases the CMB’s supervision over them.  The bill aims to introduce a licensing scheme for crypto firms, which will be handled by the CMB and bring the firms under the regulator's scope. To protect customers, the scope of inspections for crypto providers will also be expanded.  Although there is no provision regarding taxation in the bill, CMB and TÜBİTAK will obtain certain rates of income from crypto service providers. CMB and TÜBİTAK will receive 1% of these revenues from crypto service providers. The Scientific and Technological Research Institution of Türkiye (TÜBİTAK) is a national agency of the country whose stated goal is to develop “science, technology and innovation” policies, support and conduct research and development.  This bill is expected to increase Türkiye’s compliance with international standards regarding crypto assets, eliminate criticism from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and make the country’s crypto ecosystem safer.  In March, the country’s economy minister, Mehmet Şimşek, shared the government’s efforts to get out of the FATF gray list with the public and stated that a delegation will come to Türkiye for inspection in April-May and emphasized that the gray list will be removed.

Through a detailed examination of the XRP/USD chart on a monthly time frame, as sourced from Binance, Dark Defender highlights a large bullish formation, which he describes as a “bull flag” across multiple longer-term time frames including monthly, three-month, and six-month charts. XRP Price Gears Up For Explosive Move The analysis shows a substantial initial upsurge in price marked by a green arrow, suggesting a strong bullish momentum that started around early 2017 and peaked later that year. The price action following this peak is what Dark Defender identifies as a bull flag pattern. This pattern is characterized by a period of consolidation following a sharp movement in price, resembling a flag on a pole. The consolidation, traced with a red descending trend line and a blue ascending trend line, forms a converging pattern known as a triangle, which typically suggests that the period of consolidation is nearing an end as the lines converge. According to Dark Defender, this suggests a breakout is imminent.

But a bullish one. It is in the monthly, three-month, and six-month time frames. If you know a bull flag, you can enjoy your coffee today. Cheers,” he stated. In his forecast, Dark Defender uses the flag pole and Fibonacci extension levels to predict future price points. After the expected breakout above the red resistance line, the first target is situated at the 161.80% Fibonacci level, which would bring XRP to approximately $1.88. A further ambitious target is set at the 261.80% Fibonacci level, priced at about $5.86. The most optimistic target lies at the 361.80% Fibonacci level, forecasting the price to soar as high as approximately $18.23. Notably, Dark Defender’s blue line, analogous in length to the flagpole, shows that the XRP price could rise well above $18. Different Analysis, Similar Price Targets This analysis was further commented on by another renowned XRP community analyst, EGRAG CRYPTO, who brought attention to the fact that the flag portion of the pattern extends beyond half the length of the initial pole, a structural detail that might typically invalidate the bull flag designation. Related Reading: Buckle Up, XRP Fans: Analyst Eyes Price Explosion To $0.65 In Next 5 Days “I’ve dabbled in this analysis before, but lately, I’ve become increasingly intrigued by the potential of a symmetrical triangle breakout. What caught my eye is that the Flag is extending beyond half the length of the Pole which invalidates the structure. Regardless of who’s right or wrong, hope to meet in the near future and being multimillionaires. Keep up the fantastic work,” Egrag noted. Despite this technical caveat, EGRAG CRYPTO remains positive about the potential of a symmetrical triangle breakout. In a recent analysis of the weekly chart, EGRAG elaborated that XRP will at least explode towards $1.5 if price breaks out to the upside of the triangle. On a broader triangle pattern, EGRAG expects a move to $5.89. “XRP Army, STAY STEADY! There’s a mini pump to $1.5 and a major pump to $5.89 in the cards, with the MACRO pump potentially soaring above 2 digits,” he stated. Despite their different approaches, the two analysts are therefore very close in their analyses. At press time, XRP traded at $0.5189.

Bloomberg reported that the customer also alleged that the digital outfits with the NFTs couldn’t be used for another 11 days after they were released because D&G didn’t get approval on time.  Dolce & Gabbana USA has been sued for messing up the delivery of its non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Bloomberg reported. The customer spent $6,000 to purchase the asset.  The report said Luke Brown lost $5,800 on the NFTs he bought and filed the case in the Southern District of New York on behalf of others who bought digital assets from the NFT project.  The complaint alleged that the company promoted the NFTs, telling customers that buying the DGFamily NFTs would grant them access to various digital rewards, physical products and exclusive events.  However, the delivery of the NFTs was late. The customer alleged that the NFTs came with outfits to wear in the metaverse, but the digital outfits that showed up 20 days behind schedule “could be used only in a metaverse platform with barely any users,” the report said.  The digital outfits couldn’t be used for another 11 days after they were released because, the complaint alleges, Dolce & Gabbana had not got approval from the NFT marketplace UNXD ahead of time.

China and Hong Kong have been conducting cross border digital yuan trials.  The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Peoples Bank of China (PBOC) expanded the scope of their cross-border digital yuan pilot to allow the use of e-CNY wallets by Hong Kong residents.  The digital yuan is China's central bank digital currency (CBDC). China has been piloting the digital yuan for several years and is among the most advanced of the countries around the world that have been exploring the applications of digital version of their currencies.  Adopters will be able to set up the wallets using just a phone number, and use them for so-called cross-boundary payments, such to retailers, but not for person to person transfers, the HKMA said in a press release on Friday. The wallets can be used in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) and other areas of mainland China where the pilot is running.  Users will be able to pay merchants directly from the wallets without needing to set up a mainland bank account, HKMA CEO Eddie Yue said in the statement. They are able to top up their wallets in real time through 17 Hong Kong retail banks using the Faster Payment System (FPS).  The HKMA intends to continue working with the PBOC to expand the application of the e-CNY. The HKMA plans to work with the Digital Currency Institute to explore including features like name verification, enhancing interoperability in payments and corporate use cases, such as cross-border trade settlement.  China and Hong Kong said they had successfully carried out the first phase of cross border digital yuan trials in December 2021 and entered a second phase following initial talks a year earlier.

Ether may have underperformed other major digital assets this year, but Coinbase says it had potential to surprise to the upside. Ether does not have significant sources of supply side overhangs, the exchange said in a research report this week. ""To the contrary, both staking and layer 2 growth have proven to be meaningful and growing sinks of ETH Liquidity,"" wrote analyst David Han. ""ETH's position as the center of DeFi is also unlikely to be displaced in our view due to the widespread adoption of the EVM and its layer 2 innovations.""

42408171,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaBFIQ,1715945012,Bitcoin Traders Target $74K Next Week as BTC Spot ETFs Log Four Days of Inflows,"Bitcoin could potentially surpass its all-time highs of $74,000 as early as next week due to increasing institutional demand and risk appetite for assets.  The U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking Bitcoin have seen four straight days of inflows, with BlackRock's IBIT receiving $94 million on Thursday, signaling a shift in investment sentiment.  Institutional demand and rising appetite for risk assets could cause bitcoin to breach all-time highs of $74,000 as early as next week, some traders say.  “Bitcoin was pulling back towards $65K on Thursday but is already trying to regain its footing above $66K on Friday morning. If cryptocurrencies get support from the global risk appetite on Friday, Bitcoin could exceed $70K over the weekend,” shared Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro senior market analyst, in a note to CoinDesk, referring to increased inflows from spot ETFs.  “A test of the $71K-$74K highs area, in our view, could happen as early as early next week, triggering a new episode of FOMO,” Kuptsikevich.  Singapore-based QCP Capital gave out similar price targets in a client note earlier this week.  Such bullish outlooks come as U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking the asset have logged four straight days of inflows, ending Thursday at $257 million in net inflows. This is a nearly 180-degree turn from the action of the past few weeks – with some of the biggest ETFs seeing zero inflows on some days.  BlackRock’s IBIT received $94 million in inflows on Thursday, the largest among peers. GrayScale’s GBTC, which has mostly seen outflows since its January listing, received over $4.6 million in inflows.  Earlier this week, multiple regulatory filings showed that several big-name funds, such as Millennium Management and Elliot Capital, held millions worth of bitcoin ETFs in their portfolios.  The softer-than-expected US Consumer Price Index (CPI), which rose 0.3% versus 0.4% in March amid economist forecasts for 0.4%, triggered a break out of the range for BTC on Wednesday.

Ether's {{ETH}} sell-off has stalled, with bears hitting a brick wall characterized by an upward-sloping trendline drawn off October and January lows, according to charting platform TradingView.  The bears' inability to penetrate that bull-market trendline since Monday suggests they might have to back up a bit and allow a price bounce before making another attempt at extending recent declines. The native token of the Ethereum blockchain has dropped more than 15% to $3,000 from highs near $4,100 two months ago, according to CoinDesk data. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a measure of the broader crypto market, lost 17% in the same period.  Supporting the case for an ether price bounce is the daily MACD histogram, which has flipped positive, signaling renewed bullish momentum. The MACD is widely used to gauge trend strength and changes.  Intraday momentum is steadily improving, with the widely tracked 50-hour simple moving average (SMA) again trending north, providing reassurance.  The immediate resistance is seen at the 50-day SMA near $3,180, followed by a descending trendline representing the recent correction, currently at $3,225.

The $30-Million Transfer Mystery,"Dogecoin (DOGE), the meme-inspired cryptocurrency with a loyal following, has been riding a wave of optimism lately. Over the past week, its price surged by nearly 8%, much to the delight of investors. However, a recent move by a large DOGE holder has cast a shadow of uncertainty on the future of this playful pup’s price trajectory. Related Reading: Whale Watch: Ethereum Fresh Buy Signal Sparks Speculation Dogecoin Fueled By Market Bulls And Short Squeeze The broader crypto market sentiment has been bullish recently, and DOGE has been happily wagging its tail along. The past week saw a significant price increase, and the good times seemed to be rolling with a 3% jump in the last 24 hours alone. This pushed DOGE’s price to a cheerful $0.152, bringing smiles back to the faces of many investors who have been patiently waiting for a sustained climb. The party wasn’t just limited to the spot market. The derivatives market also saw a notable rise in activity, with Dogecoin Futures open interest jumping a healthy 9%. This suggests a renewed interest from traders, particularly those looking to capitalize on potential price movements through futures contracts. Adding fuel to the fire, short sellers have been feeling the heat lately. According to Coinglass, they’ve faced liquidations totaling a staggering $2.27 million. This could potentially trigger a short squeeze, a scenario where short sellers are forced to buy back DOGE to cover their positions, and further push the price upwards. However, this positive development hinges on whether it can overpower the potential selling pressure arising from a recent whale movement. Whale Alert: Big Transfer Sparks Speculation Just as things were looking bright for DOGE, a transaction involving a whale sent ripples of concern through the Dogecoin community. Data from Whale Alert revealed that a whopping 200 million DOGE, valued at around $30.86 million, was transferred to the trading platform Robinhood. This hefty move has raised eyebrows, with many suspecting the whale might be preparing to cash out a significant portion of their holdings. A large sell-off could introduce significant selling pressure, potentially derailing DOGE’s current upward momentum.

The cryptocurrency unlikely to be displaced as the center of decentralized finance, the report said.  The market may be underestimating the timing and odds of a potential approval of a U.S. spot ether exchange-traded fund.  Ether {{ETH}} has underperformed the broader crypto market this year, but its long-term positioning remains strong and it has the potential to surprise to the upside, Coinbase (COIN) said in a research report on Wednesday.  The second-largest cryptocurrency by market value has risen 29% year-to-date, less than two-thirds the surge its larger rival bitcoin {{BTC}} which has gained 50%. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a measure of the broader crypto market, has advanced 28%.  ""Ether may have the potential to surprise to the upside in the coming months,"" the report said, noting that the cryptocurrency does not have ""major sources of supply side overhangs"" such as token unlocks or pressure created by miners' sales.  ""To the contrary, both staking and layer 2 growth have proven to be meaningful and growing sinks of ETH Liquidity,"" wrote analyst David Han. ""ETH's position as the center of decentralized finance (DeFi) is also unlikely to be displaced in our view due to the widespread adoption of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and its layer 2 innovations.""  The EVM is the Ethereum blockchain's native processing system that allows developers to create smart contracts and lets nodes interact with them. Layer 2s are separate blockchains built on top of layer 1s, or the base layer, that reduce bottlenecks with scaling and data.  Moreover, the importance of potential spot U.S. ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) cannot be understated. ""We think the market may be underestimating the timing and odds of a potential approval, which leaves room for surprises to the upside,"" Coinbase said  ""Even if the first deadline of May 23, 2024 encounters a rejection, we think there is a high likelihood that litigation could reverse that decision,"" the note said. ""In the interim, we believe the structural demand drivers for ETH as well as the technological innovations within its ecosystem will enable it to continue straddling across multiple narratives.""

As of Friday afternoon, FIL is hovering around $5.80, but whispers of a $15 target in the coming weeks are swirling in the cryptosphere. Related Reading: Solana On The Brink? Price Stalemate At Crucial $140 Support Recent Price Surge Ignites Investor Interest FIL has been on a tear lately, defying the overall slump in the cryptocurrency market. Over the past 24 hours, the token saw an increase of over 7%, accompanied by a healthy trading volume exceeding $420 million. This surge in price and activity has grabbed the attention of market watchers, with many speculating on the possibility of a sustained upward trend. Analyst Eyes $15: Falling Wedge Breakout Hints At Price Reversal Adding fuel to the fire is crypto analyst World Of Charts, who has expressed a decidedly bullish sentiment on FIL’s future. According to their analysis, the recent price correction appears to be nearing its end. $Fil Healthy Correction Has Almost Over Seems Like #Fil Will Recover From Here Falling Wedge Breakout Has Already Confirmed Expecting Move Towards 15$ In Coming Weeks#Crypto #Filcoin pic.twitter.com/O61j9B02ha — World Of Charts (@WorldOfCharts1) May 15, 2024 They point to a confirmed falling wedge breakout pattern, which historically indicates a potential trend reversal. This technical indicator suggests FIL could be poised for a significant rebound, with World Of Charts setting a target price of $15 in the coming weeks. FIL’s Resilience Bodes Well For Future Further bolstering the bullish case is FIL’s defiance of the broader downward trend in the crypto market. While many digital assets have been experiencing significant price drops, FIL has managed to hold its ground. This resilience suggests strong underlying support and potential for future growth. Filecoin: Technical Indicators Flash Green Technical analysis also paints a positive picture for FIL. The RSI (Relative Strength Index), a momentum indicator, is currently exhibiting a slow but steady upward trajectory. This suggests that FIL is not overbought and has room for further price appreciation. Additionally, FIL has historically displayed a pattern of high trading volume at price peaks and low volume during price dips. This ongoing trend signifies strength in the token’s price action. Related Reading: Whale Watch: Ethereum Fresh Buy Signal Sparks Speculation Breach Of Support Could Dampen Optimism However, the bullish outlook is not without its caveats. A breach below the crucial $5.50 support level could trigger negative sentiment and potentially lead to a price decline. This highlights the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market, where unforeseen events can quickly alter price movements. Furthermore, market sentiment is highly sensitive to external factors such as regulatory news, macroeconomic trends, and technological developments within the crypto space. Any adverse developments, such as stringent regulatory crackdowns or security breaches, could exacerbate selling pressure and undermine investor confidence.

27959626,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608523,1715931023,The Hidden Forces Behind Bitcoin Price: Latest Insights From On-Chain Data,"Leading on-chain analyst James Check, popularly known as Checkmatey, has recently delved into the intricacies of Bitcoin’s market dynamics, offering a detailed on-chain data analysis that sheds light on the forces driving Bitcoin prices. His latest insights highlight a period he describes as “Quiet and Trending,” suggesting a robust underpinning despite significant sell-side pressures and shifts in volatility. Bitcoin Follows The Stair-Stepping Rally-Consolidation-Rally Pattern Since December, Bitcoin has experienced substantial sell-side pressure, with over 1.5 million BTC being sold. “Around 30% of this came out of GBTC, but the rest of it was good old fashioned profit taking,” Check explains. Despite such substantial market sales, Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience with a relatively modest price correction of just -20%. This suggests that the foundational support levels for Bitcoin are stronger than what surface-level market movements might imply. A striking aspect of Check’s analysis is the transformation in Bitcoin’s volatility profile. “The overall realized volatility profile for Bitcoin is half what it was in 2021, and 3x smaller than 2017,” states Check. This trend indicates a growing maturity within the Bitcoin market, reflecting its evolution into a more stable asset over time compared to its early years. Check counters the typical narrative surrounding Bitcoin’s volatility: “What a lot of people forget however is that Bitcoin is volatile to the upside. Volatility to the upside is good!” He posits that the current increment in volatility is moderate and suggests that the market is still in the early phases of a bull run, rather than nearing its end. Related Reading: Most Important Bitcoin Indicator Nears Bullish Flip: $150,000 Soon? A critical tool in Check’s analysis is the Short-Term Holder MVRV (STH-MVRV) Ratio, which he uses to gauge market sentiment and phases. According to Check, this ratio consistently finds support at 1.0 and resistance at 1.4 during stable uptrends. Stability is maintained as long as the ratio remains within these bounds. “Only when it breaks above this ceiling do things become unstable,” Check notes, which could signal a transition to bearish conditions. Despite the sell-off that brought Bitcoin down to $57k, Check observes that this has not significantly dented the profitability of short-term holders. “The magnitude of Unrealised Loss was very much in line with bull market corrections, calming fears of a top-heavy market.” Related Reading: Is Bitcoin’s Rally Over? Top Analysts Predict Imminent Price Corrections He further highlights that several of the local top buyers panic sold their Bitcoin at the lows, an action he interprets as beneficial for the correction phase, serving to stabilize the market by shaking out weak hands. Expanding his analysis, Check refutes the criticism that Bitcoin’s volatility makes it a less viable asset. He points to a chart comparison of Bitcoin’s 30-day volatility against top-performing US stocks, showing that Bitcoin’s volatility is well within a manageable range. Furthermore, he discusses the lower realized volatility of the SPY index, attributing it to the “out sized performance of the Magnificent-7,” which is counterbalanced by the poorer performance of the other components. By highlighting the structural aspects of the current “Quiet and Trending” market phase, Check offers a refined perspective on how Bitcoin is navigating its maturation pathway, balancing between its speculative origins and its potential as a mainstream financial asset. He concludes, “Overall, the Bitcoin uptrend in 2023-24 looks fairly structured, following stair-stepping rally-consolidation-rally pattern. However, as the charts above show, volatility tends to pick up during a consolidation, and that can lead to instability.” At press time, BTC traded at $66,288.

42418216,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcrRV,1715928313,"Institutions Still Skeptical of a Near-Term Bitcoin Price Rally, CME Options Data Show","CME’s bitcoin options show investors continue to pay a premium for short-dated protective put options after Wednesday’s U.S. CPI release.  A broader outlook appears constructive, with longer-dated calls drawing relatively higher implied volatility.  While upbeat U.S. inflation data released early this week has restored institutional faith in bitcoin’s {{BTC}} long-term bullish case, it is yet to alleviate concerns of a near-term price pullback.  The odds of a near-term rally are still scant, according to CF Benchmarks’ analysis of options trading data on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), a platform widely regarded as a barometer of institutional activity.  According to CF Benchmarks, implied volatility for short-dated out-of-the-money (OTM) put options was higher than implied volatility for OTM calls following Wednesday’s softer-than-expected U.S. CPI release. These options are based on CME’s cash-settled standard bitcoin futures contract, which is sized at 5 BTC.  “The volatility skew, which represents the difference in implied volatility between out-of-the-money (OTM) puts and calls is quite pronounced in the shorter-dated options. The higher implied volatility [demand] for OTM puts compared to calls suggests investors are still cautious about near-term downside risks and are willing to pay a premium for protective puts,” CF Benchmarks said in a note shared with CoinDesk on Thursday.  Put options are derivative contracts that protect the buyer from price drops. A put buyer is implicitly bearish on the market, looking to profit from or hedge against potential price weakness. A call option offers insurance against price rallies. Put options at strikes lower than the going market rate and calls above the spot market price are considered out-of-the-money.  Implied volatility is an estimate of the future volatility of the underlying asset based on options prices. Implied volatility rises as demand for options increases.  CF Benchmarks is the U.K.-regulated provider of digital assets benchmarks like the CF Bitcoin Volatility Index. CF Benchmarks and CME also publish several crypto-related reference rates, including the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate and CME CF-Ether Dollar Reference Rate.  The volatility surface – a three-dimensional plot of the implied volatilities of bitcoin options – shows implied volatilities for short- and long-dated bitcoin options with different deltas or degrees of sensitivity to changes in the price of bitcoin. OTM options’ delta ranges from 0.5 to 0.  As can be seen, the post-CPI bias has been for OTM puts expiring in 20 to 40 days. Meanwhile, as we move toward longer-dated options, the skew flips in favor of calls or bullish bets.  “This indicates that investors are growing more optimistic about bitcoin’s longer-term prospects and are willing to pay more to be positioned for potential upside by buying OTM calls,” CF Benchmarks said.  The chart also shows relatively flat implied volatility levels for longer-dated options, a sign of increased institutional participation.  “This could be interpreted as a sign of increasing institutional involvement, as these investors often have a more nuanced view of the market and are less prone to extreme sentiment swings,” CF Benchmarks added.  A similar long-term bullish bias is seen in options trading on the cryptocurrency exchange Deribit, which accounts for over 85% of the global crypto options activity. As of writing, notional open interest or the dollar value of the number of open bitcoin options contracts on Deribit was $15.63 billion. Meanwhile, open interest in CME options was $417 million.

Bitcoin VWAP Oscillator Could Imply Potential For Further Upside In a new post on X, analyst Willy Woo discussed what the latest trend in the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) Oscillator for BTC might suggest regarding what could be next for the cryptocurrency. The VWAP is an indicator that calculates the average price for any asset by taking into account the price fluctuations themselves and weighing the values against the trading volume. Related Reading: XRP & Cardano Whales Load Up Bags: Preparation For Altcoin Rally? This means that the prices of the assets where there was a higher volume of trading have a higher weightage in the average than those with only a low amount of volume. Traditionally, the VWAP is a technical analysis indicator that considers the information available through spot exchanges. In the context of the current topic, the VWAP uses the on-chain volume of Bitcoin instead, which is readily viewable by anyone thanks to the blockchain’s transparency. The indicator of interest here isn’t the VWAP but rather the VWAP Oscillator, as mentioned earlier. This metric keeps track of the ratio between the BTC spot price and the VWAP and presents it as an oscillator of around zero. The chart below shows the trend of this Bitcoin indicator over the past couple of years. The above graph shows that the Bitcoin VWAP Oscillator has been in negative territory for the past couple of months. However, the metric’s value has been rising recently, so if it continues on this trajectory, it might approach the neutral mark shortly. In the chart, Woo has highlighted a trend that the indicator and the cryptocurrency’s price have historically shown. It seems that whenever the metric has formed a bottom in negative territory and rebounded back to the upside, the asset has enjoyed some bullish momentum. The resulting price surge may last until the indicator reverses into the positive territory and forms a top. That hasn’t happened for the VWAP Oscillator this time yet. “Still a lot of room to run before reversal or consolidation,” says the analyst. “Hate to be a trapped Bitcoin bear right now.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Not Out Of Danger Yet, NVT Golden Cross Warns In other news, as CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr. pointed out in an X post, retail investors have bought $135.7 million worth of the asset over the past month.

According to Rekt Capital, Bitcoin ended its downtrend in mid-April, breaking into an uptrend with its price surpassing previous resistance levels. This change has been marked by Bitcoin forming its first higher high since its drop to $56,000, as highlighted by Rekt Capital. This indicates a possible continuation of the bull market despite periodic market attempts to unsettle investors. The TD Sequential indicator’s sell signal comes as Bitcoin has shown a 7.6% increase over the past seven days, reaching a 24-hour high of $66,567 before retracing slightly to $65,592. Rekt Capital noted the significance of the $60,000 support level, suggesting that maintaining this level is crucial for further positive momentum. He remarked that the recent breakout to $66,000 is a testament to how quickly market sentiment can shift toward a bullish trend. The analyst disclosed: The Bitcoin Bull Market is not over.

Ether dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,860 swing low to the $3,039 high. Ethereum is now trading below $2,960 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. However, the bulls are active near the $2,925 support and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,860 swing low to the $3,039 high. Immediate resistance is near the $2,960 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,965 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The first major resistance is near the $3,000 level. An upside break above the $3,000 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance sits at $3,050, above which the price might gain traction and rise toward the $3,150 level. If there is a clear move above the $3,150 level, the price might rise and test the $3,220 resistance. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $3,350 resistance zone. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,965 resistance and the trend line, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,925 level. The next major support is near the $2,900 zone. A clear move below the $2,900 support might push the price toward $2,850. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,740 level in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone.

27946065,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608466,1715911227,Avalanche Rising: Will The Wine Capital Fund Turbocharge Gains Above $40?,"AVAX, the native currency of Avalanche, a high throughput blockchain, is rising, adding an impressive 9% from May 15 lows. Buyers are taking over after weeks of lower lows. While the expansion of Bitcoin prices could explain these gains, there could be more. Fine Wine Investment Fund Tokenized On Avalanche Avalanche has announced tokenizing a fine wine investment fund, a move that would see the platform ride on the wave of tokenization. In a statement, Avalanche said the Wine Capital Fund has been tokenized by Oasis Pro and listed on ATS via the Avalanche C-Chain, where smart contracts are deployed. Related Reading: Why Did The Bitcoin Price Rise Above $66,000 Today? The ATS is Oasis Pro’s trading platform registered by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Meanwhile, the capital fund is a “closed-end investment vehicle.” Specifically, it specializes in fine wines and is overseen by WIVX Asset Management. The decision to tokenize on Avalanche is a step forward in creating a tokenized asset ecosystem, mirroring progress made in Ethereum, among other chains. By making inroads into the fine wines market, estimated to be worth over $400 billion, the platform aims to democratize access, making it available to more investors. Analysts claim tokenization removes barriers common in traditional finance. Notably, Avalanche will play a huge role since the network is scalable, boosting a high throughput with sub-second finality. The number of real-world assets (RWA) being onboarded is rising. When writing, data from RWA.xyz reveals that over $7.6 billion worth of private credit has been tokenized. At the same time, months after announcing the deployment of the BUIDL fund on Ethereum, it manages over $381 million of tokenized United States treasuries. Efforts On Meme Coins, DeFi: Will AVAX Break $40? Avalanche is not only making progress in tokenization; earlier, they announced efforts to encourage meme coin activity on-chain. To do this, the Avalanche Foundation launched Memecoin Rush, a $1 million liquidity mining incentive program. Related Reading: Red Alert For Bitcoin: Network Hashrate Takes A 20% Dive The model follows the Avalanche Rush program. The number of decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions deploying on the high throughput chain rapidly grew through this program. As of mid-May 2024, DeFiLlama data shows that Avalanche DeFi protocols manage over $945 million. The number has shrunk by over 90% since November 2021, at over $10.9 billion. AVAX prices are stable at spot rates. However, with the coin finding support at $30 and printing a triple bottom, the path of least resistance appears northward toward $40 or higher.

The collaboration has not only paved the way for the adoption of blockchain technology in the traditional asset management sector but has also had a significant impact on the price of Chainlink’s native cryptocurrency, LINK, which has surged past the $14 threshold. Major Asset Managers Join DTCC And Chainlink The pilot, called Smart NAV, was developed by DTCC to explore the extension of its Mutual Fund Profile Service I (MFPS I), an industry-standard platform that transmits “Price and Rate” data, also known as “NAV data.” Related Reading: Why Is This Crypto Pundit Warning XRP Investors To Be At Alert For The Next 3-12 Months By leveraging Chainlink’s cross-chain interoperability and blockchain abstraction capabilities, the pilot aimed to investigate the potential of on-chain price and rate data as a key enabler for new initiatives, particularly in the realm of mutual fund tokenization. To evaluate the industry value of a DLT-based price and rate dissemination solution, DTCC collaborated with asset managers, service providers, and distributors, including American Century Investments, BNY Mellon, Edward Jones, Franklin Templeton, Invesco, JPMorgan, MFS Investment Management, Mid Atlantic Trust, and State Street. On-Chain Data Delivery For Fund Tokenization According to the announcement, the results of the pilot were positive. The collaboration between DTCC, the US banking institutions, and Chainlink reportedly showed that structured data can be delivered on-chain, enabling the embedding of foundational data into multiple on-chain use cases. This capability has far-reaching implications, including supporting brokerage portfolio applications and facilitating real-time, automated data dissemination. Moreover, Smart NAV aims to provide built-in access to historical data and simplify the relay of price and rate data through new interfaces for data consumption. Furthermore, the pilot reportedly achieved several key milestones, including validating user interfaces and applications that leverage on-chain data, establishing automation of data routing through smart contracts for dynamic data management, and preventing future fragmentation through Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). Related Reading: QCP Capital Sees Bitcoin Reclaiming $74K Highs – Here’s Why BTC Could Continue Its Rally Ultimately, the DTCC stated that the partnership with Chainlink has played a key role in the success of the Smart NAV use case. By providing an abstraction layer through its cross-chain interoperability capabilities, Chainlink has facilitated “seamless” transmission of data across multiple blockchains. This approach eliminates the need for DTCC to establish individual connections to each blockchain, mitigating costs and operational complexities while ensuring data accessibility and optimization. Bullish Momentum For LINK As of the time of this press release, the LINK token has successfully surged above the $14.88 mark, experiencing a notable 6.8% increase in price since the initial announcement on Thursday. Data from CoinGecko indicates that the token’s trading volume has also seen a significant surge of 17% in the last hours, reaching a substantial figure of $400 million. However, for LINK to recover from its 72% losses from its all-time high of $52.70 reached in May 2021, it faces two key resistance levels as shown on the token’s daily LINK/USD chart above. These resistance walls are located at $15.18 and $17.8 respectively, before potentially moving towards the $20 mark. It remains to be seen whether the current bullish momentum will persist and further propel the price of LINK beyond these levels.

27941092,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608391,1715904050,XRP & Cardano Whales Load Up Bags: Preparation For Altcoin Rally?,"On-chain data shows that XRP and Cardano whales have been accumulating recently, which can be bullish for the prices of these altcoins. XRP & Cardano Whales Have Gone On A Buying Spree Recently As analyst Ali explained in a new post on X, XRP whales have seen their holdings go up over the last couple of weeks. The indicator of relevance here is the “Supply Distribution” from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, which tells us about the total amount of assets the different market groups hold. Related Reading: Bitcoin Not Out Of Danger Yet, NVT Golden Cross Warns The whale cohort is of interest in the current discussion. These investors hold between 1 million and 10 million XRP in their balance. At the current exchange rate, these amounts are worth around $0.52 million and $5.2 million, respectively. Clearly, these are pretty significant holdings, which is why whales are considered influential in the market. Now, here is a chart that shows how the Supply Distribution of the entities belonging to this XRP group has looked like recently: The graph shows that while the XRP price has been stuck in consolidation during the last couple of weeks, the whales have been viewing the opportunity as a buying one. These humongous investors have scooped up over 110 million cryptocurrency tokens (equivalent to almost $57 million) inside this window. This buying scale isn’t particularly massive, but the fact that these investors have been backing the coin through this poor period should be an optimistic sign. It would also appear that XRP isn’t the only one on the large holders’ radar recently. Market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock revealed in an X post that Cardano has also seen a significant buying push. In the above chart, IntoTheBlock displays the holdings of the Cardano investors, which are between 100 million and 1 billion ADA. This range’s bounds convert to about $45.3 million and $453 million, respectively, so these whales would be much more massive than the XRP ones just discussed. As is apparent from the graph, these ADA entities have expanded their holdings over the past month. More particularly, their supply has grown by 11% in this period, which, when considering the scale of the total holdings of this group, is an enormous increase. According to the analytics firm, these Cardano whales now control 6.71% of the entire circulating supply of the cryptocurrency all by themselves. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Form Capitulation Signal: What It Means This latest buying push towards XRP and ADA from the whales simultaneously could be a potential sign that these large entities are expecting an altcoin rally soon. Given that Cardano has seen it happen at a much more significant scale, the coin could likely see better returns than XRP if a surge does happen. XRP Price XRP has displayed stale price action recently, as its price has continued to move sideways around the $0.52 level.
