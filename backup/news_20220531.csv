42415448,U2msve444uc2I0ChHDVrdJ,1654040968,First Mover Asia: Tether Is Quiet About Its Bankers. Will It Affect Its Peg?,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and a few altcoins had a good day; ether was down.  Insights: Tether is honoring 1:1 peg redemptions – so far.  Technician's take: Buyers are reacting to oversold conditions, although upside in BTC appears limited.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $31,837 +0.3%  Ether (ETH): $1,947 -2.4%  Bitcoin rises, but not ether  Bitcoin continued its recent, mini-rebound on Tuesday, at least temporarily.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was still chugging along near $32,000, the threshold it crossed during midday trading in a follow-up to a U.S. holiday weekend surge. Bitcoin has risen nearly 8% over the last nearly four days. Still, analysts remained cautious about predicting any long-term bounce to the upside amid ongoing inflationary concerns and the prospect of a recession.  ""The emerging rebound from the bottom may be self-sustaining at first, as many market participants believe that the crypto market has corrected enough to become attractive for long-term buying,"" FxPro Senior Market Analyst Alex Kuptsikevich wrote. ""However, fundamentals such as halving, soft monetary policy or accelerated adoption are needed for growth to continue.""  Bitcoin was faring better than ether, which spent much of Tuesday in the red and was recently changing hands at about $1,950, a 2% decline. Other altcoins were mixed with SOL and AVAX recently down over 3%, but ADA soaring over 25% at one point amid a a rise in the issuance of native assets on the network and the upcoming Vasil hard fork, a network upgrade expected in June that would increase scaling capabilities. AXS rose more than 15% at one point.  Stocks dropped, breaking a short winning streak as investors weighed central banks' approach to tame rising prices and a decline in the Conference Board's consumer confidence index. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 all fell less than a percentage point.  Annual inflation in eurozone countries climbed in May to 8.1% annually, its highest level since the launch of the euro currency. Meanwhile, the fallout of Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine continues to grow, with eurozone countries discussing how they might help Ukraine evade a Russian naval blockade to help the country export grain, and separately, the possible seizure of Russian central bank assets. Brent crude oil, a widely regarded measure of energy markets, was trading at over $116 per barrel.  The news was potentially more upbeat in China, where COVID-19 cases plunged below 100 nationwide for the first time since March, and the country's largest city, Shanghai announced plans to begin reopening its economy. And U.S. President Joe Biden met with Fed Chair Jerome Powell and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to discuss ways to combat inflation.  In an appearance on CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program Tuesday, Opimas CEO and founder Octavio Marenzi noted that possible Federal Reserve flexibility about a rate hike much later in the year after it raises rates at its next two meetings had ""given crypto markets breathing room to say 'maybe they're going to go back to printing more money more rapidly.' That's helping crypto in the very, very short term. But I think we're likely to be disappointed in that in the long term.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,132 -0.6%  DJIA: 32,990 -0.6%  Nasdaq: 12,081 -0.4%  Gold: $1,838 -0.7%  Insights  Tether’s various banking relationships don’t matter until we know the whole picture  The Financial Times has a story this week about ""some"" of Tether’s $73 billion in reserves being stored at a relatively obscure Bahamas bank called Capital Union.  The bank has around $1 billion in assets, so only a small portion of Tether’s reserves could be stored there. Historically, Tether has been something of a banking vagabond; it initially opened accounts in Taiwan (and this is the likely subject of a U.S. Department of Justice probe), and when corresponding banking access was cut off Tether moved on to Montreal and Puerto Rico.  None of this really matters, according to Tether – which has declined to fully disclose its banking relationships – because Tether can process redemptions (conversion of its USDT stablecoin to fiat U.S. dollars) upon request. Tether maintains “strong banking relationships with more than seven, eight banks across the world.” This would be as far as the disclosures will go. Indeed, in the aftermath of the collapse of Terra's UST stablecoin, Tether has processed $10 billion in stablecoin redemptions.  But the market would disagree. In the weeks since Terra’s UST first started showing signs of trouble, Tether has had to fight to maintain USDT's 1:1 peg with the dollar. Circle’s USDC hasn’t had the same problem; in fact, its stablecoin has been pushed above the peg as a result of inbound capital.  Tether’s desire to keep the nature of its banking relationships and reserves secret has already cost it $18.5 million, which is what it paid out in a settlement with the office of the New York Attorney General.  Perhaps Tether believed that if it were totally honest and disclosed its relationships and the nature of its holdings backing its dollar peg, the resulting market chaos would cost it more than $18.5 million. The articles of faith around Tether involve the ability for it to process redemptions, and so far that has held and succeeded in times of crisis – so no need to list out its banking partners and cause unnecessary trouble.  The question is, will this rationale hold, and will USDT’s peg be maintained through this coming bear market.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Relief Bounce Faces Resistance at $33K-$35K  Bitcoin (BTC) broke above a short-term downtrend over the weekend and reclaimed the $30,000 price level. The cryptocurrency is experiencing a relief bounce after several weeks of oversold readings on the charts. Still, resistance at $33,000 and $35,000 could stall the upswing in price.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart has risen from oversold levels over the past two weeks, which supported the buildup in price momentum. The 14-day RSI is currently neutral and will need to remain above 50 in order to sustain the relief bounce.  On the weekly chart, the RSI is the most oversold since March 2020, which preceded a crypto rally. This time, however, the significant loss of long-term momentum suggests upside could be limited.  For now, price action could stabilize above the $27,000-$30,000 support zone, which could delay additional breakdowns on the chart.

(The Wall Street Journal) ... ""With the right policies, the U.S. can transition from recovery to stable, steady growth and bring down inflation without giving up all these historic gains. During this transition, growth will look different. We will likely see fewer record job-creation numbers, but this won’t be cause for concern. Rather, if average monthly job creation shifts in the next year from current levels of 500,000 to something closer to 150,000, it will be a sign that we are successfully moving into the next phase of recovery – as this kind of job growth is consistent with a low unemployment rate and a healthy economy.

35972,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=238104,1654039820,What’s fueling Ethereum’s Intrinsic Value?,"Ethereum is one of the most useful cryptocurrencies in the market. In terms of market capitalization, it&apos;s second only to that of Bitcoin. As a result, it&apos;s highly regarded as a financial tool by many people. Ethereum is also home to a slew of cutting-edge technologies, like NFT and dApps. However, how can Ethereum come to have its own intrinsic value? What is the Definition of Intrinsic Value? To begin discussing the intrinsic value of Ethereum, it is necessary to first define the word &apos;intrinsic value.&apos; In layman&apos;s terms, intrinsic value is the true value of any asset. The inherent worth of any asset should not be confused with its market price. This is because market prices may be either under or overvalued. When it comes to digital currencies, the intrinsic value may be defined in a variety of ways. Any digital currency&apos;s inherent worth is defined by its scarcity, real-world applications, and broad technological usage. This simply indicates that the more a digital currency&apos;s utility, the greater its inherent worth. As Ethereum&apos;s utility in real-world activities rises, so does its value, and it has received a lot of attention in the cryptocurrency market. The use of smart contracts is the most notable element that improves the utility of the Ethereum blockchain and network. These smart contracts are regarded as Ethereum&apos;s first and most essential utility feature.

Development has ramped up, making it the network with the most developments going on. This activity has translated to a rise in the total value locked (TVL) on the network. And although this value has been declining for a whole, it recently recorded a recovery that saw it jump 30% in a single day. Cardano TVL On The Rise Shortly after multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXes) had been launched on the Cardano network, the TVL had quickly climbed. This was a result of the accelerated adoption that came with notable personalities such as Snoop Dogg taking to the platform and bringing their enormous fanbases with them.

The New York Times reported the news Tuesday, citing two people familiar with the matter.  The Times attributed the decision, which would have taken Forbes public at a $630 million valuation through a merger with Hong Kong-based SPAC Magnum Opus Acquisition Ltd.

42417151,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcSK3nJ,1654031209,Megan Kaspar: Meta-a-Porter Fashion,"When people today imagine the metaverse, most probably envision a fully immersive virtual reality universe like the one Steven Spielberg created for the movie “Ready Player One.”  But according to Megan Kaspar, managing director of Web 3 investment at incubation firm Magnetic, our future digital and physical realities will be far more integrated. Far removed from the pixelated platforms that are popular now and the cartoon PFPs that proliferate on Twitter, Kaspar believes the metaverse will be a blended, photorealistic experience in mixed reality that blurs the lines between human and computer.  Megan Kaspar is a speaker at Consensus 2022, CoinDesk's festival of the year June 9-12 in Austin, Texas. Learn more.  As a poster girl for the trend, Kaspar is a trailblazer with a habit of racking up world firsts. In October 2021 she was the first person to wear non-fungible token (NFT) fashion on live broadcast television, flaunting a series of digital costume changes throughout the interview, including gold earrings programmed to track her head movements so they mimic the swing of a real pair.  Then, in January 2022, she was featured on the front cover of Haute Living’s Miami issue wearing a digital outfit by the luxury designer Fendi, seamlessly superimposed onto her original photoset. On both occasions she was dressed by DressX, a digital fashion platform in which Kaspar invested, which uses 3D software to create and simulate virtual garments that look like real clothing.  In crypto since 2012, Kaspar was early to get into bitcoin as well as ether, SOL and MATIC. More recently, she became a founding member of the first-ever fashion-focused decentralized autonomous organization, Red DAO, which bought the most expensive fashion NFT to date – The Doge Crown by Dolce & Gabbana. Purchased for 423.5 wrapped ether (wETH, worth $1.27 million at the time) from NFT marketplace UNXD, the crown was part of the world’s first couture NFT drop by a luxury brand. Of the nine NFTs in the groundbreaking collection, Red DAO purchased three.  The Doge Crown was a Web 3 move made by a traditional fashion house, with the holder of the NFT entitled to both digital and physical versions of the crown as well as exclusive access to a range of real-world experiences. Kaspar reveals, however, that over 90% of the digital fashion acquired by Red DAO is from digital-native designers. This, she says, is where Red DAO’s mission and purpose truly thrives.  In this interview, I spoke to Kaspar about the current immaturity of wear-to-earn business models in digital fashion, how on-chain data capture will empower individuals to take control of their online identity (and why our digital selves may soon be more important to us than our physical selves) and how Web 3 is really just a bridge between Web 2’s centralization and the fully decentralized Web 4. She also makes a compelling case to explain how NFTs are helping – not hurting – the planet.  The cover shoot you did for Haute Living was the first time a human wore digital luxury fashion on a cover, right? How was that actually achieved?  Maye Musk was on the cover of Vogue Czechoslovakia in November of 2021, wearing a digital T-shirt that was printed with a galaxy image on it. But if you look at those photos, you can still tell that it's digital clothing.  The Haute Living issue came out just a couple of months later, and they did an exquisite job with those photos. I was excited to do that shoot and to be the first person to show the world what the capabilities and possibilities are with digital fashion.  When we took the photos, I wore some SKIMS pieces that were tightly fitted and solid-colored, and then shorts. It also had to be strapless because you can't really Photoshop those out and it can look fake. Then, you can superimpose anything. But for the poses that I sat in or stood in, the algorithms couldn't dress me. They had to be tailored perfectly.  On Red DAO’s Instagram, we took a photo from the Haute Living shoot and Tribute Brand created a special, huge red dress that was superimposed on me. It's amazing how you can get the colors, the dimensions and the shadows to look very real.  What are the use cases for digital fashion? What is the most challenging part of creating it?  We're limited today as to what we can do with digital fashion. There are really only three use cases.  One is digital tailoring on existing photos and videos, which would be great for e-commerce. Models can just take photos and have the clothes digitally imposed on them instead of shipping trunks of clothing all around the world for different shoots and then having a stylist manage the physical items. Influencers can do the same, and they can receive an NFT of the item. Then they can redeem it in the real world or do other things with it.  The second use case is augmented reality. We can use digital fashion and [augmented reality] today on existing platforms like Instagram, TikTok [and] Snapchat, as well as dedicated apps like DRESSX or ZERO10. For example, I have a pair of NFT virtual earrings that I'll wear during Zoom calls, and people won’t even realize they’re virtual.  The third use case is to dress your [profile picture]. And I think PFPs will morph into meta-human avatars. I don't think most people are going to want to identify themselves personally as a Bored Ape or World of Women cartoon. I think the majority of the population will want something that they can aspire to, that represents the human version of them but is better.  We see that a lot in Web 2 with Instagram and different social media platforms, how people represent themselves, how they're sharing content and how they're using those platforms. Web 3 is going to provide an upgraded version of digital identity. And then, proof of ownership comes along with that and many different ways to monetize.  Are there people working on solving the interoperability barrier for those digital items that you want to be able to wear all the time, but at the moment only work on specific platforms?  Interoperability has two buckets. First, you've got software interoperability. For example, if you were on Chrome, you’ll easily be able to use the Snap filter and wear the NFT augmented reality fashion, or perhaps there's an API that Zoom could plug into and that could easily be solved.  The other bucket of interoperability is the digital asset itself and the components of how a pixelated item looks in Decentraland, as opposed to something that was created in Unreal Engine that would appear more photorealistic.  This is something that projects like Glamhive and Meta Closet are looking to solve, where each item will have its own nested file. You have a pair of earrings, and those earrings may have many different files that can work across different platforms. Time will tell if the market will actually want that.  What is your take on skeuomorphism? Why do metaverse artists, designers and architects still create objects that resemble the physical world when they could create literally anything imaginable in digital spaces?  Some traditional designers creating in Web 3, like Rebecca Minkoff and Jonathan Simkhai, are skeuomorph, and I attribute this to relatability. The same reason not all of us will want to be represented by cartoon-like avatars for our digital identity, we want to look and wear fashion that is relatable to our physical human experience. RTFKT and D&G are examples of bridges between replicas of physical reality and fully fantastical fashion and apparel.  Some of the Collezione Genesi couture pieces by D&G are incredible photorealistic matches to their real-world counterparts, while others, like the impossible jackets, cannot exist in the physical. D&G also provides ready-wear digital fashion along with runway digital fashion people wouldn't wear day to day in physical reality.  Others are fantastical, meta-native brands, designers and architects like DRESSX, Replicant, The Fabricant, Xtended Identity, Tribute Brand, ZERO10, Cornerstone, Stefan Kartchev and Regina Turbina.  The NFTs in some of the collections you just mentioned are selling for millions of dollars. Some people think that’s crazy. Is it crazy?  In terms of value, people use certain expensive, luxury items as wealth or status signaling. But we're also seeing that in the digital world, right? If you have one of these special CryptoPunks or a Bored Ape that's worth millions, you're immediately validated. It's like digitally flexing for recognition.  The other day, I was talking about engagement rings, and how I really don't want one unless it's tied to an NFT. And then I started thinking about what a ring can signal depending on what community you're in, like, how it can signal a certain social status. And it hit me that that same thing is going to happen in digital.  Even so, it seems a lot of people don’t really ""get"" the concept of NFTs and the importance of digital ownership. Do you think digital fashion will still be popular without being blockchain-based?  When I have questions like these, I always look at China first, because they're always ahead of us. In China, there's an app called Little Red Book, or Red. That's their version of Instagram, where they're buying a lot of digital fashion and wearing it in augmented reality.  These items are actually NFTs, but they don’t call them NFTs, they call them digital assets due to regulatory concerns. They're on a centralized blockchain that, I believe, Alibaba and a few other corporations in China have created. And while these digital assets do not come with all the benefits of an open, permissionless blockchain, Little Red Book’s 300 million registered users don't seem to care. Ultimately, it comes down to what the consumers care about.  Will consumers care about digital fashion being an NFT? Will these items be NFTs? I hope they will. I want them to be, because that's how we can be in a fully decentralized, interoperable environment.  I believe that will come in Web 4, because Web 3 is actually going to be a bridge between Web 2’s centralization and Web 4’s full-on decentralization. I think we'll look back in history and see that Web 3 ended up being a distributed space. We're onboarding a lot of consumers to Web 3 right now, because fully decentralized environments are not easy to use and consumers like fast, cheap and easy.  What are some examples of business model innovation that NFTs can bring to the traditional fashion industry?  Web 2 only captures a tiny fraction of data from our daily lives. It is difficult to emphasize the incredible amount of data that will be created and captured through the use of Web 3 devices, such as near-eye wearables enabling augmented reality. With tracking and tracing on blockchains, digital fashion can also be geographically tagged. Brands could track when or how many times you wear an outfit. Your clothing can tell your life story through data collection.  Most importantly, regarding our personal data, our online identity in Web 2 was about capturing fragments of our lives, whereas Web 3 gives us the ability to have ownership and an online identity that can be greater than our physical identity.  Meanwhile, the unlimited environment can lead to brands and designers creating micro collections for scarcity. NFT fashion can be staked or rented out. Or “wear-to-earn” can also result in higher brand engagement, loyalty and retention. Future wear-to-earn models can even use components of move-to-earn and play-to-earn, and this can be a way of generating income in the future.  What are some examples of wear-to-earn projects?  There’s DAVA Project and 10KTF, although 10KTF wasn't specifically wear-to-earn, it was just dressing your PFP. But the business model, the roadmaps, are eventually to get to a wear-to-earn model. These are very nascent. We're not really seeing any companies adopting it or using it yet because I think that the NFT environment has to evolve before that happens. Similar to how [decentralized finance] had to evolve before play-to-earn, we'll see DeFi and NFTs evolve, and then wear-to-earn models.  You could maybe make the argument that Stepn and Space Runners are wear-to-earn, but it's mostly like move-to-earn or act-to-earn. Ultimately, these “to-earns” will come down to using some form of digital fashion or wearable. It may not be an avatar, but it'll most likely come down to accessories, fashion, clothing. And that's an incredible capability that gets unlocked.  What do you plan to do with the items in Red DAO’s collection? Have you tried renting or staking?  We haven't done any staking or renting of our items yet. There just aren’t any really sophisticated platforms for us to do that right now. But we’re looking at it. I think we will do those things in the future.  How does Red DAO function as a DAO?  You have to be invited to join Red DAO. New members are accepted through a voting process involving all the existing Red DAO members, of which we have over 50 including Marc Weinstein, 2PunksCapital and NFT collector G-money, as well as digital fashion designer Charli Cohen and influencers like Dani Loftus. That's what keeps the DAO private and safe. It's actually a Delaware LLC, so it's not a DAO in the sense that it's completely decentralized. It is decentralized in that we use blockchain for voting and decision-making, but that's the extent for now. The units that everyone gets are not tokens that are publicly traded. They're not on a [decentralized exchange] or a centralized exchange.  All the decision-making happens inside of a Discord channel that's gated. You can only enter with the wallet that you use to contribute to the DAO. Everyone evaluates things together in different channels and then it goes up for a vote through the DAO's blockchain platform. Voting on-chain is weighted, depending on the amount of ETH that member has contributed to the DAO.  Many people are concerned about the energy consumption of blockchain technologies and resulting climate concerns. Do you think this will stand in the way of mass adoption of metaverse wearables and other NFT-based digital clothing and accessories?  So many large corporations both in and outside of the fashion industry are using the argument that blockchain is this super-polluting energy-consumption mechanism, which is far from the truth.  If you look at the data on the amount of energy consumed by global bitcoin mining, it's 189 terawatt-hours as compared to 162,194 terawatt-hours of total global energy use, so that accounts for only 0.117% of all energy consumed annually. And over the last two years, bitcoin miners have become increasingly energy efficient through the use of sustainable sources like wind, solar, hydro, geothermal and nuclear. Bitcoin is powered by a 56% mix of sustainable energy, which is more than any other industry in the U.S.  Meanwhile, proof-of-stake and delegated proof-of-stake chains like Telos, Solana, Celo and, hopefully soon, Ethereum too will result in 99.95% less energy usage inside the Ethereum ecosystem. Plus, all of those blockchains are designed for rapid, high-volume transactional activity.  I see Web 3 offering an immense amount of energy efficiency across every major industry globally. Especially the fashion industry, which is one of the top polluting industries in the world, responsible for about 10% of annual global carbon emissions. That’s more than all international flights and maritime shipping combined.  The environment is assaulted every day by wasteful practices in manufacturing, transporting, distributing and disposing of unsold or unwanted clothing. About 40% of Western clothes go unworn, and 40% of what actually gets manufactured in a factory doesn't even go to market, it ends up getting incinerated.  Further, according to the United Nations Environment Program, to make one pair of jeans it takes almost 3,781 liters of water from the production of the initial product to the final product in the store. The emissions are almost 33.4 kilograms of carbon equivalent.  So the impact of the fashion industry moving to a digital-first model is very hard to overstate. Wearable NFTs, which are fashion dematerializing, will play a very large [environmental, social and corporate governance] role globally.",POSITIVE,ETH,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH,Leah Callon-Butler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/31/megan-kaspar-meta-a-porter-fashion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c64923997d91717c9107864409600456a9d62687-2880x2160.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It appears that extreme bearish sentiment and oversold signals have encouraged some buyers to return from the sidelines.  The bulk of BTC's relief bounce was seen on Sunday when the cryptocurrency rose above $30,000. The weekend price jump was bitcoin's largest daily return since March, with the price increasing by 7.8%, according to Arcane Research.  Meanwhile, most alternative cryptos (altcoins) underperformed bitcoin on Tuesday, which suggests traders are still not comfortable with taking on additional risk. Bitcoin's market cap relative to the total crypto market cap ticked higher over the past three days after breaking above a yearlong downtrend on May 13. Typically, alts underperform BTC during down markets because of their higher risk profile.  Just launched! Please sign up for our daily Market Wrap newsletter explaining what happens in crypto markets – and why.  Still, some altcoins rallied on Tuesday as bearish sentiment began to wane. For example, Cardano's ADA token and Axie Infinity's AXS token rose by as much as 15% over the past 24 hours, compared with a 4% rise in BTC over the same period.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Short squeeze  On Sunday, BTC's price spike triggered an uptick in short liquidations, which was the largest since May 11. That could reflect a short squeeze, which happens when traders who are short BTC scramble to close out of their positions when the price unexpectedly rises.  Liquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position as a safety mechanism because of a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. That happens primarily in futures trading.  Oversold bounce  Bitcoin and other cryptos appear to be deeply oversold, according to some indicators.  The chart below shows MRB Partners' cyclical momentum indicator, which is the most oversold since the 2018 crypto bear market. That could point to a short-term bounce across cryptos.  Still, momentum indicators can remain in oversold territory while prices are in a downtrend. At times, a cross above oversold thresholds can confirm a bullish shift in price, similar to what occurred at the end of previous bear markets. That could take a few weeks to develop.  Some analysts are skeptical about the latest price bounce. ""While it is plausible that BTC can continue its reversal after posting its first green weekly candle in 10 weeks, the persistent macro headwinds make us cautious in the immediate term,"" FundStrat wrote in an email.  MRB published a report last week that discussed several macroeconomic headwinds that could weigh on bitcoin's price despite oversold readings. For example, BTC's sell-off since last November coincided with tighter liquidity conditions, a decline in global negative yielding debt and lower amounts of cash held in money market funds and savings deposits – a complete reversal of the boom years for cryptos and stocks.  Altcoin roundup  ADA pumps: The Cardano blockchain’s native token surged on Tuesday as other major altcoins jumped in tandem with bitcoin. Fundamental catalysts include a rise in the issuance of native assets on the network and the upcoming Vasil hard fork, which is a network upgrade expected in June that would increase scaling capabilities. The upside looks limited for a continued recovery, as ADA faces heavy resistance at 80 cents. Read more here.  Record inflows for Algorand funds: Investment funds that manage ALGO, the Algorand network’s token, racked up $20 million in inflows during the week ended on May 27, CoinShares reported. The record weekly fund inflow was likely triggered by new product launches for the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that scored a partnership deal with FIFA, soccer's world governing body, this month. Multi-asset funds, funds that manage more than one cryptocurrency, extended their streak of inflows, totaling $191 million in inflows since the start of the year. Read more here.

Past Performance of Cardano The Cardano coin is one of the top performers reading from ADA technical analysis in the daily chart. The coin is up 18 percent at spot rates, outperforming the USDT. Technically, from an effort versus results perspective, bulls might have the upper hand following the reversal of May 11 losses. Cardano Technical Analysis According to Cardano technical analysis of the daily chart, it can be seen that buyers have the upper hand. The surge of prices in the past few trading days, reversing the losses of May 11 and 12, is bullish. Notably, ADA crypto prices are also trading above the middle BB. It is a former resistance, now support. Therefore, bulls have the upper hand as long as Cardano token prices are above the middle BB and ideally $0.50. In the short term, buyers can buy dips, targeting March 2022 lows of $0.78. What to Expect from ADA? Buyers are firm, and the path of least resistance seems northwards. The expansion of crypto prices and the break above the middle BB could be a foundation for more gains.

42421548,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXocZB,1654025123,Why You Should Consider Pooling Support Behind DeFi’s PoolTogether,"You should consider buying a non-fungible token (NFT) to support the Ethereum-based mainstay of decentralized finance (DeFi) called PoolTogether. Currently, there’s a class-action lawsuit filed against the popular application winding through the New York court system, with potentially far-reaching effects for the crypto industry.  Last October, Joe Kent, a software engineer and former staffer for the consistently anti-crypto Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), sued PoolTogether in New York State for allegedly running an “unauthorized lottery scheme.” And now the company behind the protocol is selling “Pooly” NFTs to fund its legal defense.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  PoolTogether is a “no loss” lottery that allows people to contribute cryptocurrency to a shared pool that reinvests funds in yield-generating DeFi products, and then pays out that income as rewards to a few lucky “ticket” holders every week. Unlike a traditional lottery, PoolTogether’s smart contracts allow people to recuperate their investments if they lose the draw or reinvest in the ongoing financial operation.  Although you may not “win” using PoolTogether, you cannot lose. The tool, one of first decentralized apps grouped under the burgeoning DeFi economy, is a liquidity provider for the industry and a way for crypto holders to potentially be rewarded for holding crypto or participating in these community games.  Ahead of filing his lawsuit, Kent deposited $10 in crypto into the protocol. He’s claiming the application built by PoolTogether Inc., which is incorporated in Delaware, supports an illegal form of gambling. New York state law allows buyers of unregulated lottery tickets to bring class-action lawsuits on behalf of themselves and other ticket holders.  There’s a small issue regarding only PoolTogether and how it might fit under existing financial rules. The company’s lawyers have argued that PoolTogether is not a lottery, but something closer to a Premium Bond – a prize-linked savings account that lowers investment risks. U.S. banks and credit unions have been authorized to provide these services since 2014.  See also: 4 Things You Find in Crypto That Aren't in Traditional Finance  The larger issue, however, touches all of crypto. In essence, the lawsuit is about decentralization and the responsibility software coders hold once crypto applications go live. “It aims to test the question of whether or not creators can make something, release it on a blockchain and really claim not to control it anymore,” Axios’ Brady Dale wrote.  Smart contracts cannot be edited once launched. And like other DeFi tools, PoolTogether has sought to give its users a stake in, control over and governance of the protocol by issuing its own crypto token called POOL.  Legal responsibility?  Kent has also filed suit against PoolTogether founder Leighton Cusack and a number of the protocol’s investors, including Dragonfly Capital, Compound Labs and Galaxy Digital – thus raising questions about who is legally responsible in cases of “harm” in crypto. In his complaint, he also criticized crypto’s environmental impact and the scam culture that thrives in the industry.  His concerns are real, and there is a need to maintain avenues for litigating against crypto founders that do real damage. Figures like Terra’s Do Kwon should take responsibility for the harm they cause if and when things go awry, especially if they maintain technical control and influence over a protocol.  However, Kent’s specific case is frivolous and seeks to undermine the core tenets and value of the crypto industry. Decentralization is a spectrum, and one that is largely only achieved in time. Crypto potentially benefits the world by removing gatekeepers and intermediaries from some financial and cultural services.  DeFi is experimenting with the notion that tools can be built and successfully turned over to its communities. This is a departure from the world of traditional financial services, but a method that has long been applied to open source-software development. Saying Cusack is liable for his app in perpetuity undermines crypto’s chief aims.  Just as Bitcoin was built by Satoshi Nakamoto and released into the world for anyone’s benefit, that might be reproducible across blockchains.  Cusack has argued that the PoolTogether tool is an open source and noncustodial protocol. The eponymous PoolTogether company has contributed software development to its open-source code and maintains a web interface at pooltogether.com, but it doesn't profit from the PoolTogether protocol that would continue existing without their presence.  That said, the company has raised funds and has significant exposure to the POOL governance token – all by design. DeFi allows builders to risk spending time and effort building token-powered tools, with the hopes that through increased use and speculation their treasuries will increase in value. Today, POOL is worth about $1, significantly down from $26 at launch.  See also: DeFi: Building the Infrastructure for Future Economies  Cusack is also front and center to the legal fundraising that’s hoping to raise 769 ETH (about $1.5 million) by selling NFTs. Proceeds from the sale will go to PoolTogether Inc. and will be “used for legal expenses of the company and its officers and directors, as needed” with any remaining assets going towards “other business purposes,” the campaign website reads.

The &apos;spent output profit ratio&apos; (or the SOPR in short) is an indicator that tells us whether Bitcoin investors are selling at a profit or a loss right now. The metric works by looking at the on-chain history of each coin being sold to see what price it last moved at. If this price was less than the current one, then the coin has been sold at a profit. On the other hand, the last selling price being more than the latest would imply the sale of the coin has realized a loss. When Bitcoin SOPR values are greater than one, it means coins moving right now are, on average, selling at a profit.

In an event dubbed as &apos;The Merge&apos;, the current network and its decentralized application will begin operating on the latter. Related Reading | Analyst Hints Huge Chances For Ethereum Killers To Surge, Sides With Solana And AVAX Core ETH Developer Tim Beiko recently announced the successful roll-out of a Beacon Chain, or a mainnet PoS network, for its longest-lived PoW testnet &apos;Ropsten&apos;. This will aid developers in launching &apos;The Merge&apos; on this test network. The event is set for June 8th. If successful, Ethereum and its developers could be steadily moving to a mainnet Merge event at some point in the coming months. The Ropsten Beacon Chain must meet certain requirements before operating on a PoS consensus, as Beiko clarified: For The Merge to happen, we now need two things on Ropsten. First, its beacon chain must activate the Bellatrix upgrade, scheduled for June 2. Then, a PoW total difficulty value, the Terminal Total Difficulty (TTD) will be chosen to trigger the transition. In that sense, Beiko asked node validators to prepare for the upcoming PoS transition.

42423202,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2XIXh,1654019808,"Zcash’s NU5 Upgrade Goes Live, Boosting Privacy and Removing ‘Trusted Setups’","Zcash (ZEC), one of the cryptocurrency market’s longest-running privacy coins, is getting even more private.  On Tuesday, at block height 1,687,104 (about 17:56 UTC), the NU5 upgrade with the Halo Arc product suite was activated on the mainnet, or live version of the network.  Zcash is designed to let users choose whether or not to reveal the details of their transactions. In bitcoin (BTC) and most other cryptocurrencies, transactions (including their amounts, and sending and receiving addresses) are usually out there for all to see on the public ledger, or blockchain.  Read more: What Is Zcash? The Privacy Coin Explained  Private transactions in the Zcash protocol use zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP), a type of mathematical calculation that signals to the network that something is definitely true – like the validity of a transaction – without publishing additional information about that transaction, such as the addresses or the transaction amounts.  Tuesday’s upgrade not only improves the platform’s future scalability but also, more importantly, the foundational way that it protects users’ privacy.  Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk, holds ZEC. With a $1.16 billion market cap Tuesday, ZEC is the 57th-largest cryptocurrency, according to digital asset data provider Nomics.  What’s in Halo 2?  Halo Arc, invented and developed at Electric Coin Company (ECC) with the support of the Ethereum Foundation, includes updates to Zcashd (Zcash’s consensus node software), an ECC wallet prototype and the ECC wallet software development kits (SDK). Perhaps the most notable change to the wallet software is the change to its privacy setting. Whereas users previously needed to opt in to shielding their transactions, the upgrade will now enable privacy-protecting, shielded-by-default transactions.  The wallet SDK also includes auto-migration so that funds will automatically shift to the newest shielded pools. A shielded pool is a collection of all shielded transactions stored on the network.  Further simplicity is added with the introduction of unified addresses, a feature that creates a single Zcash address that is compatible across all Zcash value pools, including shielded and transparent ones, so that users no longer have to juggle multiple address types.  No more ‘trusted setups’  When Zcash launched in 2016, the team held a “ceremony” that relied on a trusted setup. It required the creation of a secret number from which a derived number was created in multiple parts by multiple actors. Once the protocol was established, the holders of those parts – known as “cryptographic toxic waste” – would then be trusted to destroy their parts without revealing what they contained. This type of ceremony would then need to be repeated at every hard fork, or major systemwide upgrade.  Read more: Edward Snowden Played Key Role in Zcash Privacy Coin’s Creation  Tuesday’s upgrade has removed the need for trusted setups in future hard forks. As a result, those trusted parties will no longer be a possible vector of attack or weakness in the protocol’s security. The process for implementing future hard forks is also simpler now because it won’t require the elaborate and costly procedures associated with setting up and securing the original ceremonies.  Improved scalability  Halo 2 also introduces PLONK, a new kind of z-SNARK (zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge), to verify transactions more efficiently. Essentially, PLONK is an instance of a proof that can verify itself, “allowing any amount of computational effort and data to produce a short proof that can be checked quickly,” according to an ECC blog post.  Halo 2 is an open-source project that encourages community participation and contribution. However, as Zooko Wilcox, the creator of Zcash and founder and chief executive of ECC, pointed out, “While the Halo Zero-Knowledge Proof system is available to the world under a permissive (MIT) open-source license that allows anyone to do anything with it, the new Zcash shielded money protocol is not.”  Zk-proofs have long been a part of the development roadmap for Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain, and are poised to play a role in future scaling and privacy systems for its zero-knowledge-powered Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Similarly, distributed store protocol Filecoin has been using Halo as part of its scaling system.",POSITIVE,ZEC,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | ZEC | FORKS,Christie Harkin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/05/31/zcashs-nu5-upgrade-goes-live-boosting-privacy-and-removing-trusted-setups,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/900a55bb3316e82c0b9eac2c94443951743b1055-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

With the advent of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) a few years ago, many dynamic concepts such as Play-To-Earn (P2E) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) cropped up. The latest trend in crypto, called Move-To-Earn (M2E), is currently taking the crypto world by storm, introducing a way for users to earn rewards through simple forms of movement such as walking or running. The mechanisms and methods through which Move-To-Earn NFTs are generated may vary among games, but all rewards are acquired by activities involving movement. Imagine walking and earning crypto! Sounds like a dream, right? Only it is not anymore. Why is M2E gaining traction so quickly? Gamification of tasks and activities has long been proved a great way to incentivize and motivate people to perform tasks. The M2E model was pioneered after P2E, both of which allow in-game assets to be tokenized and thus tradeable, allowing users to earn passive income. Move-To-Earn simply offers more variety and more diverse scope of activities for users to participate in, where earning tokens isn&apos;t limited only to gamers. Compared with P2E, this already has a much broader audience and user base. Currently, Move-To-Earn NFTs are the only needed initial investment for games using the M2E concept.

Although bitcoin, along with the rest of the crypto market, has been on a downturn lately, the price of a single BTC remains around $30,000, or about the starting price of a new Toyota Prius. Many take one glance and move on, not understanding that anyone can buy fractions of a bitcoin at countless places for pennies or even less.  Actually, bitcoin has a built-in way to express this: the satoshi. Named after the mysterious creator of the world’s first cryptocurrency, the satoshi represents the smallest fraction of a bitcoin you can buy, or one one-hundred-millionth of a bitcoin. Put more simply, 100 million satoshis equal one bitcoin.  If the bitcoin world offered easy ways to transact in satoshis, it could go a long way toward mainstream adoption of bitcoin and, by extension, crypto. That’s why CoinDesk is hosting a working session with select people in the industry at the Consensus 2022 Festival in Austin, Texas. It’s a private workshop to discuss ways the industry can move toward a world where transacting in sats isn’t just possible – it’s the norm.

The global banking standard-setter last year proposed rules requiring lenders to hold $1 in capital for each $1 of crypto held. That faced significant opposition from the likes of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Deutsche Bank (DB), two banks that viewed that as an overly arduous standard.  ""Recent developments have further highlighted the importance of having a global minimum prudential framework to mitigate risks from crypto assets,"" the committee said in a statement, likely referring to the recent collapse of Terra's USD stablecoin.  ""The committee plans to publish another consultation paper over the coming month, with a view to finalizing the prudential treatment around the end of this year,"" it said.

""We have booked an exceptional loss from our DeFi activities of £17m on liquidating our holding in UST,"" the firm's CEO Jean-Marie Mognetti said in the report, adding that it was a ""humbling lesson.""  For all of 2021, CoinShares' net loss widened to GBP2.4 billion from GBP1.4 billion, even as revenue jumped more than fourfold to GBP80.8 million, figures prepared according to international financial reporting standards (IFRS) show.  The net figure was attributable mainly to a loss on financial instruments. The Saint Helier, Jersey-based company noted that under IFRS gains on digital assets are not shown on the income statement.  Most of the revenue came from management fees for its exchange-trade products, which are issued by subsidiaries XBT Provider and CoinShares Digital Securities. Soaring crypto prices drove the increase in revenue, the report said.

42421163,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXasIv,1654007916,'I Don't Push Anything': Mayor Francis Suarez on MiamiCoin,"DAVOS, Switzerland — In September 2021, while appearing on an episode of CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover,” the mayor of Miami, Francis Suarez, said that MiamiCoin (MIA), a private cryptocurrency designed to benefit the city, has been mainstreaming faster than popular cryptocurrency bitcoin.  A month later, Suarez announced on CoinDesk TV that the city is planning to disperse yield earned from mining bitcoin to its citizens, and that it might even eliminate the need for Miami residents to pay taxes. But the mayor also warned that there should be no reason to believe MIA would not be volatile, considering how bitcoin has performed.  MIA, created by CityCoins, is built on the Bitcoin network and runs on the Stacks protocol, which generates MIA when people mint and send stacks (STX), the native token of Stacks, into a smart contract.  MiamiCoin has since crashed, shedding roughly 95% of its value from an all-time high around 5 cents in September 2021, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  CoinDesk spoke to Suarez about the fate of MiamiCoin following a media briefing last week, titled “The Future of Crypto: The View from Miami,” at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland.  The following has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.  CoinDesk: You've been an outspoken proponent of the crypto space and what it promises, particularly with MiamiCoin. What do you make of that recent crypto market downturn? Do you have any concerns?  Suarez: You know people ask me the same thing about bitcoin, the fact that it's lost more than 50% of its value, but that doesn't change my feelings about the fundamental technology. For me, what was interesting about MiamiCoin was the idea that a percentage of the mining revenue would go to the city. I just think that's a novel idea. Whether the tokenomics work is a much more complicated macro issue. Ironically, the stacks that we have earned, or that are put in a digital wallet for the city, which are approximately 11 million stacks, have actually generated about half a million dollars’ worth of bitcoin, in staking, that can be dispersed to all of our residents equally. And that's something that we've looked at as a project. So, I think the very limited conversations that I've had with some of the CityCoins people was, look, we have a concern, because when it's as inflationary as it is, you're seeing a precipitous price drop, which is what we're seeing in a lot of tokens. And that makes people lose confidence. I think the loss of confidence is what jeopardizes the project. So, if they don't want to see the project jeopardized, then they should fix it. I think that they've gotten that message out that they're trying to fix some of the tokenomics. Just to put the numbers in context, I mean, in bitcoin, you only have 19 million approximate bitcoin issued. In MiamiCoin, 3.65 billion have been issued in not even a year. So I think they were off in that tokenomic. And that's something that they're going to have to figure out.  You told Reuters that there were some glitches associated with MiamiCoin. Are you attributing the dramatic value-shedding we have seen with MiamiCoin to these technical glitches?  I mean, I can’t say that for sure, but it seems that way, when you have that kind of money supply, people are selling more than they're buying, that's usually what drops the price.  Where’s MiamiCoin at right now – what are adoption numbers like?  I don’t know.  In your view, what’s next for MiamiCoin?  I've seen some utility. I’ve seen some conferences in terms of creating utilization. I think CityCoins is also trying to fix some of the economics of it to see if they can stabilize the price from what I've read and seen in terms of some of the things that they've put out. I think once those things happen, then I think we'll see. I mean, we have used $5 million that was granted to us for a rent stabilization program to help people whose rent has increased by more than 20%. Then there's $11 million in a digital wallet that has created half a million dollars in bitcoin, and our intention was to disperse that. We're sort of seeing how this all plays out before we make a final decision.  You said MiamiCoin is an idea.  Exactly. Yeah.  Are you talking to other leaders and mayors, perhaps, on how it might be replicated in other states or cities?  You should talk to CityCoins. They are the ones that have the mining equipment. They have also created more coins.  Are you also speaking or advocating to push this idea of a city coin to other places?  I don't push anything. I talk about the facts, that's what I do.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TRADING,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/05/31/i-dont-push-anything-mayor-francis-suarez-on-miamicoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/538cf2e372f68d8a7355e3cb14295d28a2d0d568-4608x3456.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company was one of many to pull out of the project later that year.  The Aptos funding round was led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) with participation from Multicoin Capital, a16z alum Katie Haun, Three Arrows Capital, ParaFi Capital and Coinbase Ventures, among others.

42423223,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2XJ1h,1654003913,"First Mover Americas: BTC Finally Sees Rebound, but It Could Be Short-Lived","Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. I’m Lyllah Ledesma, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights.  Price Point: Bitcoin witnessed a small relief rally and is up 3.4% on the day. Analysts think that this is likely to be short-lived.  Market Moves: Cardano's ADA spiked 25% over the last 24 hours. CoinDesk's Shaurya Malwa looks at this in more detail.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) has finally seen relief and has soared above last week's low of $28,500. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was up 3.4% over the last 24 hours, trading at around $31,600. Bitcoin has tumbled roughly 16% over the course of May, at one point taking the price down to its lowest since late 2020.  BTC reached a high of $32,200 on Monday and performed significantly better than the S&P 500 futures while Americans took the Memorial Day holiday.  Laurent Kssis, head of Europe at Hashdex, said in an interview with CoinDesk that this is a short-term trend for BTC and the current signals are not substantial and could reverse very quickly.  “I still see a trading range in the $30K level which could break as downward pressure is still compromised,” said Kssis.  Pablo Jodar, financial products manager at Storm Partners, a systems provider for the cryptocurrency space in Europe, also said that despite the rebound for bitcoin, the fundamentals have not changed yet.  “We might see BTC going further upwards to $35,000 this week, as some short sellers will get liquidated and will need to buy back, but we still remain bearish for the short term,” said Jodar.  “The real question is can ether break above $2,000 again and continue its ascent as altcoins try to readjust after LUNA demise, but we are not confident short term,” said Kssis.  Ethereum (ETH) is up by 4% on the day and was trading around $1,900.  Last week, CoinShares data showed that Ethereum witnessed outflows of $11.6 million. Ethereum performed considerably worse than bitcoin did last week.  The total year-to-date inflows to all crypto backed funds currently amounts to $520 million, compared with inflows of $5.9 billion the same time last year, according to data from CoinShares.  Alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, also saw positive increases over the last 24 hours, with Cardano’s ADA taking the lead, soaring by 27%, Aave by 16% and NEAR protocol by 12%.  AXS, the native token of play-to-earn game Axie Infinity, soared by 29% over the last 24 hours.  Market Moves  By Shaurya Malwa  Crypto markets added some 4.4% to overall capitalization in the past 24 hours as bitcoin (BTC) saw signs of bottoming out, and traditional markets showed strength at the start of this week.  Cardano’s ADA token led gains among crypto majors with a 17% rise to trade over 64 cents on Tuesday. Fundamental catalysts include a rise in the issuance of native assets on the network – over 5 million assets have now been minted on Cardano, data shows – and the upcoming Vasil hard fork, a network upgrade expected in June that would increase scaling capabilities.  Price charts suggest ADA saw support at the 45 cents level. Readings on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) – a tool used by traders to calculate the magnitude of an asset’s price move – fell to nearly 33 earlier this week, which suggested early signs of ADA bottoming out. However, the token could see strong resistance at the 80 cents mark.  Ether (ETH) added 5.8% even as gas fees fell to lows. A fall in fees usually implies falling demand for the network, suggesting the move may have been led by traders betting on a market-wide revival instead of being driven by fundamental growth.  XRP rose 5%. Avalanche’s AVAX and Solana’s SOL added up to 4%. Meme coins dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB) saw limited gains, rising just 3.8% and 2.3%, respectively, to underperform the broader market.

The main thing is that the play ended positively. The new trading week in the BTC market began with a counter-attack by buyers and breaking the local mark of $31,400. During the day, buyers managed to absorb all the efforts of sellers for the previous two weeks. Given the dynamics of growth, the BTC price without any problems should rise to $34,500. It is in this note that it will become clear whether the global correction of the BTC price from November 2021 has ended or not. https://www.tradingview.com/x/Ao9JKgeo/ If you look at the monthly timeframe, the situation is not very clear yet. On the one hand, the May candle was able to break the global range of $29,000. However, the month may close with a false breakdown. And the higher the price of BTC closes, the better the chances will be for a strong growth wave in June. In the event of a breakthrough and consolidation above $34,500, we will expect the BTC price to continue growing to $39,000. Given the depression of the cryptocurrency market, we are not yet planning a more aggressive price movement. It is possible to buy Bitcoin with confidence after the end of the local growth wave, about $ 39,000 and the retest of $31,500. If buyers manage to keep this mark - the global consolidation of Bitcoin with the first target of $48,000 and the final one of $60,000 will be continued.

42423203,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2XIZh,1653998412,Polkadot’s Moonbeam Adds Liquid Staking Giant Lido,"Polkadot is bringing liquid staking to its network of blockchains, allowing cryptocurrency owners who’ve pledged to support the proof-of-stake (PoS) network an avenue to increase their revenue streams by earning additional yield in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.  Moonbeam, a connectivity layer between the Ethereum blockchain and services being built on Polkadot, is working with Lido, a staking derivatives platform that allows ether (ETH) and other cryptos locked up in staking contracts to be used elsewhere.  The move to bring Lido’s liquid staking to Polkadot was also facilitated by blockchain auditing and staking specialist MixBytes, the companies announced on Tuesday. In February, the same group unveiled liquid staking on Kusama, Polkadot’s so-called canary network, an experimental version of the blockchain.  Under liquid staking, cryptocurrency owners who’ve pledged to support proof-of-stake networks by dedicating their tokens to the process, receive a kind of staked IOU token. That token can then be invested to earn yield in DeFi apps.  The Lido integration enables holders of Polkadot’s native cryptocurrency, DOT, to stake their assets in the form of xcDOT (cross-chain DOT), for which they receive an stDOT (staked DOT) token. Both xcDOT and stDOT are XC-20 tokens, a token standard created by Moonbeam for compatibility between the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and the Substrate framework that powers Polkadot.  Moonbeam, which went live in January after raising over $1.3 billion to secure a parachain slot on Polkadot, has been assembling the infrastructure and tools needed to harmonize activity across multiple blockchains, said the platform’s CEO Derek Yoo. Lido, with some $8 billion in locked value on Ethereum alone, is an important integration, he added.  “Liquid staking is really a basic building block of the ecosystem,” Yoo said in an interview. “We’re positioning Moonbeam as the best place to make multichain apps, as we believe there’s a shift from people deploying apps with a single chain to deploying them to multiple chains, which is part of why we chose to build on Polkadot.”  As well as the smart contract-based application that lives on Moonbeam, there’s also a component that lives on the Polkadot relay chain, the ecosystem’s rule-enforcing centerpoint that handles blockchain security and staking services in particular, explained Yoo.  “Behind the scenes, these specialized components are being combined to present one simple application to the user,” he said. “That’s a little bit of our thesis in a nutshell: Apps are going to start to be built with multiple specialized chains, but at the same time, you’re kind of hiding the complexity away.”  Part of Lido’s concept as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is that any team can create liquid staking on any chain, according to Lido founding member Konstantin Lomashuk. Still, liquid staking on Polkadot was difficult, Lomashuk added, pointing out that Polkadot’s cross-chain communication format (XCM), which the integration leveraged, was only delivered three weeks ago.  “It was quite hard to develop because you have these two different blockchains that communicate, the relay chain and parachain, and you also need to redistribute the stake on different validators,” said Lomashuk in an interview. “So it took a lot of research, but has made a great addition to our product line, where institutional and retail users can get liquid staking of the same quality on Polkadot as they do on Ethereum.”",POSITIVE,DOT | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | DOT | ETH | RESEARCH,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/31/polkadots-moonbeam-adds-liquid-staking-giant-lido,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ae49df6288db8a05af075f7a9e31470682ae732d-5472x3648.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It aims to provide faster transactions and 24-hour trading support as well as compliance and tax-reporting tools.  Growing its tech team and providing support ether (ETH) support would signal Fidelity's intent to expand into the crypto industry.  ""The incredible energy around digital assets as an emerging asset class makes this an interesting time for anyone looking to move into a career in the space, including those working in more traditional areas within financial services,"" Jessop said.

However, deal activity is likely to drop, mirroring trends in other VC categories, the report said.  The number of VC cryptocurrency investments peaked in December. If the crypto industry matches other sectors, the level could slide as much as 50% by the end of the year, the bank said.  A slowdown is expected as “activity across eight of the most important VC bellwether markets over the past 12 months has reset 50% from peak; worsening performance of some of the largest tech/crypto investors who are prioritizing existing holdings over deploying further dry powder, and the exit of ‘tourist capital’ as both token and equity investments become more challenging during a crypto bear market - a similar pattern seen during 2018/19,” it added.  Venture capital is a form of private equity investing where financing is given to startup companies and small businesses with high growth potential.  Plentiful U.S. dollar liquidity and rising crypto prices fueled record VC investment in the sector last year, with more than 1,800 deals, the note says. This represented an increase of 160% above the average of the previous years. Investment in crypto was 7% of all venture capital investment globally, it added.  Morgan Stanley notes that at the beginning of 2020 most investment was in crypto infrastructure and financial services, in late 2020 to mid-2021 decentralized finance (DeFi) applications were favored and from the end of 2021 into 2022 non-fungible-tokens (NFTs) and gaming companies saw the most investment.  DeFi is an umbrella term used for lending, trading and other financial activities carried out on a blockchain, without traditional intermediaries. NFTs are digital assets on a blockchain that represent ownership of virtual or physical items and be sold or traded.

The token was launched on a new blockchain dubbed Terra 2 following the depeg of algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST).

Bitcoin regained the $31,000 level in U.S. hours on Monday after nine weeks of losses. That move came amid a relief rally in Asian markets, and technical data suggesting the asset may have bottomed out between the $29,000 to $30,000 range.  Cardano’s ADA token led gains among crypto majors with a 17% rise to trade over 64 cents on Tuesday. Fundamental catalysts include a rise in the issuance of native assets on the network – over five million assets have now been minted on Cardano, data shows – and the upcoming Vasil hard fork, a network upgrade expected in June that would increase scaling capabilities.  Price-charts suggest ADA saw support at the 45 cents level. Readings on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) – a tool used by traders to calculate the magnitude of an asset’s price move – fell to nearly 33 earlier this week, which suggested early signs of ADA bottoming out. However, the token could see strong resistance at the 80 cents mark.  Ether (ETH) added 5.8% even as gas fees fell to lows. A fall in fees usually implies falling demand for the network, suggesting the move may have been led by traders betting on a market-wide revival instead of being driven by fundamental growth.  XRP rose 5%. Avalanche’s AVAX and Solana’s SOL added up to 4%. Meme coins dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB) saw limited gains, rising just 3.8% and 2.3% respectively, to underperform the broader market.  Elsewhere, metaverse tokens saw a bump in prices. Axie Infinity’s AXS rose 46%, while The Sandbox’s SAND rose 11%. Growth in AXS came weeks after the game’s “Origin” version was launched in April, which created a demand for the tokens.  The relief in crypto markets comes amid optimism in Asian markets. Coronavirus cases in China dropped to under 100 for the first time since early March, spurring an increase in sentiment among traders betting on a wider economic recovery.  The rally in Asia continued on Tuesday. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng and China’s Shanghai Composite added over 0.70% since the session’s start, while futures on U.S. tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 gained 0.63%.",POSITIVE,ADA | AXS,ADA | ASIA | AXS | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/31/cardanos-ada-spikes-25-leads-gains-in-crypto-majors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c57b59c287d6e251800be4a03a4ab1c098a64ef8-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As this evolution happens, new innovations are created from time to time. One new innovation going around the crypto industry is Ethereum Name Service (ENS). Everyone is familiar with the domain name service (DNS), which is the component of the internet that comprises domain names and connects web browsers to websites. ENS serves a similar purpose for the Ethereum blockchain as DNS does for the internet. As DNS is to the internet, ENS is to the Ethereum blockchain. ENS Monthly Registration is at an All-Time High After reaching a landmark of 1 million users earlier in the month, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is now having a record-breaking month of new registrations. Nick Johnson, the lead developer of ENS, stated in a tweet that the month of May has now reached an all-time high for every single ENS metric, including the number of registrations, renewals, revenue, and income. In addition to that, there is a record number of returning users. Johnson made the statement, &apos;And there&apos;s still a week of May left,&apos; pointing to the likelihood that the number of registrations will increase before the end of the month.

42423219,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2XIzh,1653956376,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Jumps Above $31K; Ether Gas Fees Drop,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: A day after bitcoin completed its record ninth-straight weekly decline, the largest cryptocurrency's price jumped by the most since early March.  Insights: Ethereum's gas fees are at a record low, Sam Reynolds reports.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $31,646 +8.4%  Ether (ETH): $1,990 +11%  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Cardano ADA +17.8% Smart Contract Platform Internet Computer ICP +15.7% Computing Chainlink LINK +12.2% Computing  Biggest Losers  There are no losers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Bitcoin posts biggest daily price rise in two months, as crypto markets rally broadly  Traditional markets were mostly closed in the U.S. on Monday for the Memorial Day holiday, but bitcoin (BTC) didn't rest.  The largest cryptocurrency by market value jumped more than 7% to about $31,500, in its biggest gain since March 9.  The sudden burst higher came as bitcoin had just completed a record nine-week losing streak that took the price down to around $29,400 from $37,600.  Now, crypto analysts are starting to ask if the market is finding a bottom after the latest downdraft.  According to the blockchain analysis firm Glassnode, the recent selling pressure might be easing up. ""The price action appeared to have bottomed for the time being,"" Glassnode wrote Monday in its Uncharted newsletter.  Almost all major cryptocurrencies were in the green on Monday, with Cardano's ADA gaining some 17% and leading the CoinDesk 20.  Markets  (Most traditional markets were closed in the U.S. on Monday for an official holiday.)  Insights  As motorists complain about gas fees being too (expletive deleted) high, crypto traders are dealing with the opposite: Ethereum's gas fees are at a record low, Sam Reynolds reports.  The average transaction fee is around $3.70 now, according to on-chain data. When the year began that number was between $38 and $52 depending on the chain congestion at the time.  As such, gas-heavy transactions like selling a non-fungible token (NFT) on OpenSea or completing a Uniswap transaction are at all-time lows.  Traders seem to be spooked by the fallout of Terra and have been hesitant about jumping back into the market. On-chain data shows that throughout May there were massive spikes in gas consumption on key dates related to Terra’s decline, and subsequent spikes in activity on Uniswap as traders repositioned to shield themselves from market volatility.  The problem is, they aren’t getting back into the market: Gas is low, Uniswap is (comparatively) idle, and the price of ether continues to trend downward. Ether’s price is recovering, but demand is weak because there aren’t as many active traders at the moment.  While the prices of Solana's SOL and Avalanche's AVAX have begun to recover, the number of daily active users has not. Both of these chains were built in an era of high Ethereum gas fees, so it could be that low gas isn’t driving a rush to their doors. But it's more likely there’s no reason to do anything at all until things stabilize.  One knock-on effect from all of this will be how soon the Ethereum Merge happens. Because without high gas fees, there will be less a sense of urgency in migrating to proof of stake, and with that comes controlled, more predictable fees. What was once expected in June has been pushed off to “the fall” (autumn) and prediction markets are putting that date between October and the end of the year. Let’s see if gas fees stay low and this is delayed again.
