42401434,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbksb,1523656217,Bitmain Gets Go-Ahead for US Bitcoin Mining Operation,"China's crypto mining giant, Bitmain, is one step closer to establishing mining facilities in Washington state.  The Port of Walla Walla - Walla Walla county's economic development agency - unanimously approved a land lease and purchase option that would allow Bitmain to build its new crypto mining facility. The company's Ant Creek subsidiary will be able to lease 10 acres with an option to purchase after one year. However, an initial option for an additional 30 acre purchase was removed from the agreement.  Ant Creek still has to agree to the terms to complete the deal, local newspaper the Union Bulletin reported. If it does, it will pay approximately $4,700 per month in rent.    Bitmain has yet to publicly acknowledge the company as a subsidiary, but publicly available company registration information lists Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu as Ant Creek's sole governing person, as previously reported.    According to the Union Bulletin, Jeff Stearns, the company's director, described Ant Creek during the hearing as both a blockchain company and an artificial intelligence company headed by two different CEOs. Likewise, without specifying Bitmain, he reportedly characterized the company as the largest global manufacturer of crypto mining equipment.  Walla Walla residents voiced concerns over the amount of energy the company would extract from the community, which has some of the cheapest electricity rates in North America.  ""It extracts electricity and creates wealth for the owner with no trickle down,"" said local resident Robb Lincoln, according to the Union Bulletin.  The hearing was reportedly tense, and one resident was escorted out of the hearing during the public comment period.  Another community member criticized cryptocurrency more generally.  ""It's not used in legitimate business,"" Peder Fretheim told the Port commissioners. ""It's used for two things: transactions you want to hide from the law and speculation.""  Crypto mining companies have been quick to flock to regions with energy surpluses and inexpensive rates, but they are increasingly being met with resistance from locals.  Elsewhere in Washington state, officials announced a moratorium on new crypto mining operations in order to consider their effect on the community's power grid. The Mason County officials followed Washington's Chelan County in instituting temporary freezes on new mining operations.  Likewise, the government of the Canadian province of Quebec recently instructed utility firm Hydro-Quebec to halt its consideration of service applications from mining companies due to overwhelming demand.

42401425,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbkjk,1523649340,Credit Karma: Almost No One Is Reporting Crypto Tax Gains,"Users of Credit Karma's tax preparation software appear to be under-reporting their cryptocurrency holdings, according to data provided by the company.  Fewer than 100 of the first 250,000 federal tax returns filed using the service reflected cryptocurrency gains or losses, the company reported. A spokesperson told CoinDesk in a statement that the ""reporting of bitcoin gains [is] still at negligible levels.""  Further, Credit Karma compared reporting levels from February 2018 and April 2018. Less than 100 people reported bitcoin gains or losses out of the first 250,000 users to file, or roughly 0.04 percent. The spokesperson added:  ""With tax deadline less than a week away we reran the analysis and looked at the most recent 250,000 filers on the Credit Karma Tax platform and while we saw a more than 100 percent increase in the rate of those filing, the total remained a tiny fraction with still less than 100 people of the 250,000 having reported gains.""  However, fully 5 percent of Americans reported owning cryptocurrencies in a survey, according to TechCrunch.  While investors may not be reporting gains, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the U.S. federal tax agency, considers bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to be property. In other words, investors who sold cryptocurrency holdings in 2017 - for a gain or loss - need to report those transactions on a Form 8949.  Mining cryptocurrency is also a taxable event, whether or not the resulting holdings are sold. Hard forks resulting in new cryptocurrency holdings, such as the bitcoin cash fork, are taxable in at least some cases, but clear guidance from the IRS is lacking.  While there are questions surrounding what is taxed exactly, the uncertainty isn't due to a lack of interest. The IRS has employed Chainalysis, a startup that analyzes blockchain transactions, since 2015 to look into possible rules. The agency explains in documentation related to the contract:  ""This is necessary to identify and obtain evidence on individuals using bitcoin to either launder money or conceal income as part of tax fraud or other Federal crimes.""

Renwick Haddow, who was indicted in June on fraud charges for operating the Bitcoin Store and a startup called Bar Works, had been arrested by Moroccan authorities in July and detained for nearly nine months.  Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and William Sweeney Jr., assistant director-in-charge of the FBI's New York office, announced Friday that Haddow had been sent back to the U.S.  The Morocco Ministry of Justice originally held Haddow to investigate the Bitcoin Shop, Bar Works and a third venture of his called InCrowd Equity.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission first filed fraud charges against Haddow last year, claiming his Bitcoin Store misled investors, as previously reported. According to the SEC's complaint, the Bitcoin Store claimed an ""experienced team of leading investment professionals"" ran the outfit.  But the ""experienced team"" was fabricated by Haddow, according to the Department of Justice. In reality, he alone was the brains behind the Bitcoin Store, the DOJ said.  Further, the Bitcoin Store's shareholder mailing list announced various investments and partnerships which did not exist, according to a DOJ complaint filed in June 2017. The document continued:  ""Investors in Bitcoin Store equity, including Investor-1, have not obtained any return on their securities.

Lafayette parish is in dire financial straits, officials say. A presentation given by the town in March stressed that property tax revenues are insufficient and that a fund used to finance operations is running dry. The measures put forward to address the situation included raising taxes, eliminating the parks department and annexing unincorporated land.  According to local reports, Robideaux favors a less conventional solution: create a cryptocurrency and sell it.  He said Thursday that the parish should launch its own crypto, distribute it through an ICO, and use the proceeds to ""build a living lab of blockchain researchers and developers,"" the Acadiana Advocate reports.  The mayor-president did not explain what function this cryptocurrency would serve besides raising funds. He said the goal was to ""develop solutions targeting government inefficiencies, and, more importantly, alternatives for financing public infrastructure.""  Other municipalities have toyed with the idea in the past. The city of Berkeley, California, proposed creating a cryptocurrency earlier this year, describing the tokens as ""crypto enabled microbonds.""  Similarly to Lafayette, Berkeley's impetus is a funding crunch. The predominantly Democratic city has seen federal money for housing programs decrease under the Republican Trump administration. One Berkeley official presented the ICO in explicitly political terms, saying: ""the resistance requires a token.""  Robideaux, a Republican, tried to distance himself from any kind of ideology in his recent speech. Cryptocurrency, he said, is ""not just a bunch of global libertarians that want unregulated, untraceable and secure digital currency transactions.""  He went on to say:  ""It's the recognition of global stakeholders that the world of banking, finance and payment systems is forever changed, that the world of healthcare, government and possibly every other industry is about to be disrupted.""

The ceremony saw developers, community members and other contributors created random code for the zcash privacy protocol in order to make it more secure. Notably, those involved then got rid of the cryptographic ""toxic waste"" – the random code used to secure the protocol – by destroying their computers or otherwise wiping the machines used to generate the data.  This procedure prevents malicious actors from attacking the protocol or creating counterfeit tokens, as previously detailed by CoinDesk.  Sean Bowe, a member of the Zcash Foundation, announced the completion on the project's mailing list.  He added in the message:  ""All of the participants did a wonderful job, and I'm very happy with the diversity and openness of the ceremony.

Nearly 90 individuals or teams participated in the ceremony, each using unique methods to generate the cryptographic toxic waste, according to the Foundation's Github page.  The methods used to create – and later destroy – this data ranged from looking at lava lamps to introduce randomness, to using radioactive waste material to generate code.  All of these actions were taken in preparation for the second of two hard forks scheduled for 2018. While some members of the zcash community are preparing for the first hard fork, dubbed Overwinter, Powers of Tau is specifically targeted at the more impactful Sapling hard fork.

42401443,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbkzU,1523627148,"XVG, EOS, ONT: 3 Cryptos Leading the Market Recovery","The crypto market is finally showing signs of life after a painful first quarter.  The total value of all cryptocurrencies, also known as total market capitalization, jumped above $300 billion on Thursday and was last seen at $325 billion, the highest level since March 26, according to CoinMarketCap.  Also, the total market capitalization has jumped 31 percent in the week ended Friday.  The much-needed relief rally in the broad crypto markets could be associated with bitcoin's 21 percent weekly gain. The world's largest cryptocurrency defended the key 50-week moving average support in the first half of the week before rising to 2.5-week highs above $8,200 Friday.  Meanwhile, ethereum's native cryptocurrency, ETH, appreciated 38 percent week-on-week and is the top-performing major coin. Ripple's XRP and bitcoin cash gained 32.8 percent and 23.9 percent, respectively.  However, a look at the performance of the top 25 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization reveals that verge's XVG token has outperformed its peers. Also, EOS and Ontology's ONT token have etched out impressive gains.  Verge  Weekly performance: +58.36 percent  All-time high: $0.30  Closing price on April 6: $0.058483  Current market price: $0.092619  Rank as per market capitalization: 20  Verge's XVG token takes the top spot for the second week. The 58 percent surge could be associated with growing investor interest in verge's mystery partnershiphttps://cryptoglobalist.com/2018/04/10/which-mysterious-partner-will-verge-xvg-choose-part-1/ announcement, scheduled for April 17. Speculation is making the rounds that an angel investor, TokenPay, might be involved in the partnership. Also, a few other names like Overstock.com, Amazon, eBay, are being thrown around across social media.  Also, XVG is the second most actively traded cryptocurrency on Binance. Anticipation of the April 17 announcement will likely keep XVG better bid over the weekend. However, profit taking (sell the fact) after the announcement could push XVG lower. Note that the sell-off could be sharp if the announcement fails to meet heightened market expectations.  Daily chart  The relative strength index (RSI) shows overbought conditions, so the XVG token looks ripe for a pullback. Only a close below $0.05 (50-day moving average support) would signal invalidation of the bullish case.  EOS  Weekly performance: +55.68 percent  All-time high: $18.71  Closing price on April 6: $5.89  Current market price: $9.17  Rank as per market capitalization: 5  EOS picked up a bid on April 11 and jumped to $9.56 Friday on Bitfinex – its highest level since Feb. 20.  The developers recently announced an eosDAC airdrop to the EOS token holders and the lure of making free money via airdrop seems to have put a bid under the token. The airdrop is scheduled to happen on April 11. Thus, the token will likely remain in demand over the weekend.  However, EOS looks overbought, according to the technical chart below.  Daily chart  The relative strength index (RSI) has moved above 70.00, signaling overbought conditions. So, the resistance at $9.525 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement) could prove a tough nut to crack.  That said, the 5-day moving average and the 10-day MA are biased bullish (rising). So, the pullback could be short-lived. Only a close below $7.28 (March 21 high) would invalidate the bullish view.

In a newly released consultation paper published Thursday, the Caribbean financial regulator said it is aiming to capture a wide range of cryptocurrency-related activities under the bill in a bid to prepare a more formal framework that would attract and foster cryptocurrency businesses.  The suggested virtual currency act would mandate that cryptocurrency exchanges, wallet services and payment providers, as well as businesses that promote and facilitate token sales and initial coin offerings (ICO), collect and retain customer information. Notably, regulation on ICO organizers is not part of the proposed act. Instead, the paper indicated that supervision over ICOs would fall under a separate rule.  In this way, government officials said that the proposal is not meant to prohibit the nascent industry in Bermuda. Rather, it seeks to develop a comprehensive framework that would offer cryptocurrency businesses a safer and more stable environment.  According to a report by the Royal Gazette Thursday, Bermuda's Minister of National Security Wayne Caines believes the industry needs well-rounded regulation before it can flourish.  Caines told attendees:  “We can’t keep up with the amount of people who want to come to Bermuda. We’re going to London at the weekend and we have 20 companies lined up to meet us. It’s actually phenomenal.”  In fact, through the proposal, the BMA is exploring a sandbox-like licensing scheme that would give promising blockchain startups access to the market in a regulated environment.

Prices jumped close to 14 percent on Thursday and moved above the $8,000 mark for the first time since March, according to Bitfinex. The sharp rally was reportedly fueled by the unwinding of the short trades (also known as short liquidation).  Moreover, BTC margin shorts (sell BTC trades) on Bitfinex stood well above December highs. As such, there was always a risk of short liquidation and bitcoin price rise. That said, the margin longs (buy BTC) registered a decline as well, thus putting a question mark on the sustainability of gains.  However, volume analysis suggests the rally is here to stay. The total trading volume across all exchanges jumped above $8 billion yesterday, according to CoinMarketCap. Also, the trading volume on Bitfinex hit a two-week high.  Further, the price chart analysis indicates a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change, so, the cryptocurrency looks set to extend the rally. As of writing, bitcoin is changing hands at $8,100 on Bitfinex - up 18 percent on a 24-hour basis.  Daily chart        BTC closed yesterday above $7,500, confirming a double bottom bullish breakout and the falling wedge reversal (bullish pattern). The breakout was also backed by strong volumes.  Momentum studies show a 5-day moving average (MA) and 10-day MA trending north, indicating bullish setup. The relative strength index (RSI) has moved above 50.00 (into the bullish territory).  So, the tide has turned in favor of the bulls, at least for the short-term.  View  A short-term bullish reversal has been confirmed.  BTC looks set to test resistance lined up at $8,500 (double bottom breakout target) and could extend gains to $8,620 (50-day moving average).  A Minor pullback to $7,600 cannot be ruled out as BTC looks overbought as per the RSI on the hourly chart and 4-hour chart.  Only a daily close below $7,000 would abort the bullish view.

In an announcement Friday, the bank said it aims to join the financial group to advance R3's Corda distributed ledger (DLT) platform, and push cross-industry adoption of blockchain technology.  ""We regard blockchains as the core of FinTech innovation and are working on various measures both in Japan and abroad. Through this effort, we believe that we can contribute to the progress of the global blockchain field,"" the group stated.  The news marks yet another financial institution from Japan joining the global banking blockchain consortium. Previously, a group of Japanese financial firms conducted a test to streamline international transaction agreements using R3's Corda DLT platform.  Today's announcement is also part of a wider push by SBI Holdings into blockchain technology.  As detailed by CoinDesk, the Japanese banking group has previously registered with the country's financial watchdog to launch a cryptocurrency exchange platform, which is currently pending public release.  The bank also partnered with the San Fransisco-based blockchain startup Ripple to facilitate the experiment of cross-border blockchain payments among financial institutions.

42401430,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbkmh,1523606459,Beyond Banking: R3's Expanding Vision for Global Blockchain,"R3 may have started as a consortium of banks looking to use blockchain technology, but it's broadening its ambitions.  Now a startup whose staff numbers in the hundreds, R3 is proposing its distributed ledger technology platform, known as Corda, be used to link together a wide range of businesses, not just financial ones. The core idea is similar to the one originally pitched: if companies share data and assets with each other on Corda, they can ax duplicative processes and trust that they are all on the same page about who did what.  In an example offered by R3 CTO Richard Gendal Brown, airlines, travel agents and hotels around the world could reach consensus on which plane seats and rooms have been booked, knowing that the data being shared is the same for everyone all the time.  Taking this idea further, R3’s platform lead Mike Hearn claims Corda would power a future “automatable economy” where bots help to run supply chains.  “When we stepped back and looked at what we had built, we saw something that was far more broadly applicable,” Brown told CoinDesk, adding:  “It's the freedom and power that comes from knowing that what you are looking at either as a human or a business or even some sort of futuristic robot – is not only correct, but it's current, and it is shared with your counterparts.""  While Brown said Corda has attracted interest from a variety of industries (“people in insurance, people in healthcare, people in government, energy – you name it”), the new positioning of the platform comes at a time when the dust appears to have settled after 2016’s hype about corporations exploring blockchain.  All eyes are now looking for delivery.  Meanwhile, rivals such as the Hyperledger consortium, with the help of IBM, are courting seemingly every sector and business line with some flavor of enterprise blockchain solution.  For R3, it’s a pivotal time, as the startup is finalizing the first commercial distribution of the open-source Corda platform, targeted for the end of the second quarter. This paid product will be widely available to businesses, beyond consortium members.  Open, but private  While R3, one of the first companies to promote the idea of members-only blockchains, is moving toward a more inclusive model, it’s not going whole hog.  Rather, Brown describes the vision as “an open shared network – but still private, secured and permissioned.”  The R3 Corda team were inspired by ethereum’s goal of participants all running the same business logic while getting rid of silos and friction between different applications, he said.  However, the global broadcast design of public blockchain networks, while perhaps necessary in a trustless system like bitcoin, is unpalatable to enterprises.  “My critique of some of the enterprise blockchain platforms is that being originally inspired by a full broadcast system, I would argue that often they share too much,” Brown said.  To address this problem, the governing Corda design sought to minimize the amount of data that has to be shared among participants, while convincing someone that something is true.  Corda will not show data up front, Brown said, but will send a piece of evidence to convince the other parties about a fact or set of facts, regardless of whether it's to do with banking, hotels or airlines.  'Demilitarized zone'  Aside from keeping data private within the Corda network, sharing it via the internet presents another, more immediate problem. Most companies have their own highly secured data centers, and run their existing applications on their own infrastructure behind lots of firewalls.  “The data that actually matters, the data that you want to bring into consensus, is hidden deep inside data centers of banks and large firms,” Brown said. “This necessarily involves the opening of connections between these firms and sharing data, over the public internet.”  Simply putting an enterprise blockchain node on the internet, as one would do with a bitcoin or ethereum node, is insufficient at best and possibly hazardous, he said.  “Firstly, it’s nowhere near the corporate data, and second what happens if it gets hacked? That's a big attack surface.”  To reconcile this, the Corda node, which needs to be close to the systems of the bank or the manufacturer or the airline, runs there on existing servers or on cloud infrastructure owned by that firm, securely managed in a way that these firms know how to do, Brown said.  But a small part of the node that needs to be able to connect to the other firms and receive connections from them has to be visible on the internet.  “We take a tiny bit of the node – we call it the float – and allow it to float out away from the main node and just sit out in the demilitarized zone as they call it,” Brown said.  This piece of the node is “very small, very hardened, very protected,” Brown said, adding:  ""That's the bit that is exposed to the bracing winds of the internet,""  In this way, Corda nodes are connected yet stay protected.  “The main business logic runs where it matters inside the organization and a tiny highly secured piece floats out onto the internet and is responsible for all communication,” Brown said.  ’Working insanely hard’  Ahead of the commercial release of Corda expected this quarter, R3 has just shipped version 3.0 of the free open-source version, which features what Brown calls “wire stability.” This gives developers the same certainty about their data that API stability did for their code.  “One version of a Corda 3 node deployed to a network will be compatible with any future version of Corda, so that you don't have to upgrade the whole network,” Brown said.  Asked if he has detected any loss of appetite in the enterprise blockchain space, Brown said: “No, not really. Of course you might expect me to say that. But here's why – because what I see is developers working insanely hard” in response to demand.  “Regarding the commercial version of Corda we are offering, I am being asked every day when is that going to ship,” he added, concluding:  “Maybe this is not visible from the outside, but the people who are preparing to launch major initiatives and go live, they are so heads down on delivery and execution they are not making much noise yet externally.”  R3 office image via CoinDesk.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/04/13/beyond-banking-r3s-expanding-vision-for-global-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/164d0bbf08ae700f75102c085196179f78c74ef3-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42401424,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbkhm,1523602905,Another Washington County Puts Freeze on Bitcoin Mining,"Officials in yet another county in the U.S. state of Washington have placed a moratorium on new crypto mining operations.  Announced Wednesday, Mason County’s Public Utility District (PUD) commissioners decided to implement the freeze in order to consider the effect mining operations have on the local power grid, the group said in a statement.  The moratorium encompasses “computer or data processing loads related to virtual or cryptocurrency mining, bitcoin, blockchain or similar purposes."" Applications that have already been approved are not subject to the freeze, officials stressed.  The temporary ban on new operations came due to the “rush of cryptocurrency operations” the Pacific Northwest has seen, said power supply manager Michele Patterson.  She added:  “We need breathing room to study the local impact on power demands, the ability of the system to handle these energy-intensive operations, rate structure considerations and protecting the power supply of existing customers.”  Commissioners are also concerned that mining operations are unsafe, according to the statement.  “Other electric utilities have discovered ‘rogue’ cryptocurrency operations set up in homes or commercial buildings, with no consideration for safety,” the statement noted.  Mason County’s PUD is not the only utility provider to put a moratorium in place on cryptocurrency mining operations in recent months.  Washington’s Chelan County passed a similar moratorium earlier this year, as did a city in the state of New York. Both public utilities cited the electrical cost of mining and safety concerns as reasons for the prohibitions.  Similarly, the government of Quebec has temporarily disallowed new crypto mining operations from establishing themselves in the province, which has seen huge demand from the sector due to its surplus of hydroelectric power.

42380549,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gNS9,1523592048,Hardcore Early Adopters Are Dead-Set on Kik's ICO,"""I'm long-term bullish and short term I have no idea.""  That's how Fred Wilson, a partner at Union Square Ventures and one of the most widely respected VCs working today, answered a question about the crypto market in general and specifically his outlook for Kin, the soon-to-be launched token created by the messaging app, Kik.  Wilson made the comment in a small event space on Prince Street in Manhattan, sitting in front of 28 people that Kik had flown in from 13 countries (including Japan, India and Australia), and all of whom seemed to be holders of Kik's ethereum and stellar token.  Kik had brought them together to serve as the first wave of ambassadors for the new token, serving on Reddit, Telegram, Kik groups and anywhere people might want to talk about it.  So, when Wilson expressed that mix of confidence and uncertainty, he wasn't just giving the latest market's hot take; he aligned himself with a prevailing sentiment in the room, hope mixed with some confusion. A part of his role there seemed to be to induct Kik's guests into an ever-widening circle of the true believers backing the new model for monetizing digital experiences enabled by kin.  ""I wouldn't say it was my idea, but I would way I was one of a group of people who collaborated on coming up with it,"" Wilson told the room. ""Obviously, I think it's a great idea.""  Wilson spoke during the last fireside chat of the day, in conversation with CoinFund CEO Jake Brukhman.  CoinDesk had been invited to the event to interview Kik CEO Ted Livingston as the the two day event opened. During that conversation, Livingston described himself as a wreck two years ago, as the company lost marketshare to Facebook-owned products.  In Wilson's telling, he helped bring his fellow investors in the company around to a crypto-led strategy, so that now Livingston could say:  ""Our investors are very supportive, but it took us a while to get there.""  Faced with what he saw as the impossibility of monetizing a messaging app with ads amidst the Facebook-Google advertising duopoly, Livingston elaborated, ""Our new plan was to develop a new economy around a new currency.""  An economy is, of course, one form a community takes, which helps to explain why Kik has invested in forging bonds between its early advocates, expanding the cadre from that early circle that sold the Kik board to a larger one that can sell lots of people using services online.  Here's the funny thing about it's early advocates, though: by and large, they don't use Kik. During our interview with Livingston, we asked the crowd whether or not they were big Kik users before Kin came along. Only five or six raised their hand.  It's remarkable because when Kik first unveiled this idea, many people viewed its existing audience as its unfair advantage over potential social crypto competitors.  Livingston volunteered, ""Our users of Kik are largely unaware.""  Crypto Summer Camp  Arriving at the gathering on Prince Street felt a little like coming back to summer camp, with lots of people chatting with that peculiar spirit of reunion. Only it wasn't a reunion – these people hadn't met face-to-face before, they had spent a lot of time talking online.  And it was clear that certain levels of rapport had been established. This particular hit home during the (not really necessary) ice-breaking round when one community member in particular introduced himself. ""Hi, I'm Dillon,"" Baltimore's Dillon King said. Everyone broke into applause. ""And I don't actually look like Yoda.""  Later we would learn that King is one of the most active voices on kin's Telegram and Reddit channels. ""I kind of play the role of the educator,"" he told CoinDesk.  King was dressed like a lot of the guys at the gathering (it was very nearly all men), in a purple t-shirt and a black-zippered hoodie, apparently in tribute to Livingston, who wears those two things nearly every day. He said was glad to finally get to meet people from the Kik staff in a setting where they didn't have to constantly speak as if cameras were rolling he said.  ""In general I just wanted to meet everybody,"" he explained.  We have known for a long time that people can build real bonds and relationships online as well as offline, but there's other ways in which online life is not as much like the real world as it could be. And that's the impetus behind kin: deepening digital reality.  ""We want mainstream consumers to use cryptocurrency and we think the hardest problem with that is setting up a system, setting up an economy, in a place where they would actually use it,"" Livingston told the room. That place is the internet, buying and selling for purely digital goods and services.  Livingston said they had focused on picking ambassadors who understood that there was a real opportunity in creating entirely digital markets. In fact, he took it so far that he said he hopes to see such robust digital markets that people quit thinking in kin-dollar or kin-yen terms, and instead thinking fiat terms in real life and kin terms online.  Just like people don't think about exchange rates when they buy lunch from the corner burrito place.  As we spoke to ambassadors on the floor, it was clear that they still had questions about how a stable economy could rest on unstable crypto. ""There's things I don't understand,"" Australia's Will Gikandi told CoinDesk.  Gikandi took advantage of every Q&A to pepper each speaker with questions. It was clear that he wants to believe it could all work, but he still doesn't quite see how.  The money  Probably the biggest applause line of the whole day came when Livingston said:  ""I'm not in this for the money, though I do think kin is going to be very valuable.""  It helps here to step back and revisit what Livingston believes is so big about the kin idea. He saw himself surrounded by peer companies that had successfully built communities but couldn't make money. The idea of kin is to create a way for all those companies to monetize without ads or user fees.  Livingston describes that economy as having two pieces: a cryptocurrency and a software platform that can reward developers for creating active markets for that cryptocurrency.  The strangest part of this whole kin idea is that second part, called the Kin Rewards Engine (KRE), controlled by the non-profit Kin Foundation. The idea is that developers will try to build apps that encourage users to exchange kin with each other.  ""We don't want developers to charge consumers,"" Livingston said. ""We want to set up is what we call a consumer-to-consumer economy.""  So, someone might build an app where users send artists photos and pay them in kin to make drawings of them. The artist would keep all her earnings, but the KRE (which holds 60 percent of the kin that will ever be created) would pay the app's developer every day relative to the amount of economic activity it created within the whole kin economy.  Wilson said that there's lots of companies in his portfolio who would probably benefit from jumping on the KRE once its built, but he thinks there's more opportunity with developers just having their first glimmer of an app idea now.  That said, USV is so convinced that in the future tech companies will earn so much in tokens that its begun negotiating what it calls ""token exchange agreements"" with the companies it backs. In these agreements, it would have the option to exchange its equity for tokens a company has earned from doing business (not what they generated by issuing them in an ICO).  One member of the audience wanted to know when developers could begin building business models around the KRE?  Livingston wouldn't commit, but he did give his interlocutor a standard by which to hold him accountable. There's three ways Kik has to lead, he argued. It has to have a blockchain that can support a million users, it has to have lots of regular consumers actually earning and spending in crypto and it has to have a functional incentives system (like the KRE).  If any other company starts to show traction in any of those three areas, that's when kin backers should start getting angry.  ""Who's in first place. We have no idea. Nobody knows,"" Livingston said, concluding:  ""The race hasn't even started yet.""
