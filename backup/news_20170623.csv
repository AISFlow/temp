42379528,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX88Xgv,1498252530,Local Government in China Trials Blockchain for Public Services,"A city district in southern China is using blockchain to streamline government services for its one million residents.  Chan Cheng District, within Foshan City in Canton province, announced during an event on 23rd June the launch of a platform called Intelligent Multifunctional Identity (IMI) that lets registered local residents avoid filling repetitive personal information for different public services, presumably providing a more simple and secured process.  The newly revealed system is seen as an upgrade, incorporated to the current all-in-one workflow in the local administration.  Since 2014, the Chan Cheng District government has operated a central hub inside the city that serves as a physical portal for residents who need tax, pension, healthcare or utility services, among others. Despite offering a single source at which residents can access these services, repetitive work is needed for multiple processes.  According to the district's announcement, residents who are able to register on and verified by the IMI platform will have the control of their personal information and can grant access to a government service they need. Using paired public and private keys, the system is also said to be able to verify users' identity automatically without requiring them to be physically present at a service center.  Currently what the platform looks like and when it can be accessed for actual usage remains unclear. It is said to cover a wide network of public services such as banking, telecommunication, tax and healthcare.  While such system seeks to make government procedures more accessible for residents, as the announcement detailed, it also makes it transparent if the authority wishes to track any personal activity if needed.

42379541,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX88Xw1,1498245909,"OneCoin 'License' is a Fake, Says Vietnamese Government","The government of Vietnam is speaking out after promoters of OneCoin – a digital currency investment scheme widely believed to be a fraud – claimed it had been granted a formal license in the country.  Local media sources  report that, during an event earlier this month, proponents of the digital currency claimed that OneCoin had been given a license to operate by the country's Department of Management.  According to BehindMLM, which tracks multi-level marketing schemes worldwide, the government moved to issue a swift denial after receiving questions from those who ostensibly were pitched to buy OneCoin. Those who are encouraged in to buy into the OneCoin system are asked to purchase ""packages"" which can then be exchanged for the purported digital currency. They are further urged to find others to invest in order to expand their promised rewards.  Specifically, the Vietnamese government said that purported licensure documents shared on social media were fakes with forged signatures. BehindMLM further adds that, in the wake of the Vietnamese government's statements, OneCoin promoters in Vietnam have moved to pull down posts about the alleged license.  The news represents the latest move by a national government to disavow or speak out against OneCoin, which has been accused of operating a Ponzi scheme and bilking investors through promises of significant investment returns.  Countries including Germany, India and Italy, among others, have acted in recent months to disrupt OneCoin and its proponents.

42379534,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX88Xqz,1498238431,Top Secret? Bitcoin Scaling Plan Segwit2x Leaves More Questions Than Answers,"After years of debate, the Segwit2x scaling proposal looks like it could play a role in – finally – taking bitcoin a step forward.      But the coders and companies involved have been doing at least some of the development behind closed doors, a way of working that some argue runs counter to bitcoin's value proposition as a decentralized money that no one person, or group, controls.    The project, which follows in a long line of proposals for increasing bitcoin's transaction capacity, is now supported by an all-time-high of nearly 90% of the bitcoin mining hashrate.  Since the current method of triggering major code changes relies on the support of mining pools, it seems likely that the first portion of the agreement, SegWit, will activate on the network by the end of July. (Although, it's hard to say what will happen with the rest of the proposal.)  But, while Segwit2x is perhaps the most widely-supported scaling agreement among companies and mining pools following years of debate, some have argued that key decisions are being made by an insular group of companies.  These companies, some argue, have continued pushing the proposal through even though many of the developers that are perhaps the most familiar with bitcoin's code find fault with the technical implementation and disagree with the stated goals.  And those same companies have been elusive when it comes to details about the status of the proposal itself.  Invite-only  Segwit2x was kick-started at an invite-only meeting comprised of big companies and large mining pools in the space.  From the beginning, one of the main criticisms levied against Segwit2x is that its development process isn't open to everyone. And many argue this process doesn't jibe with bitcoin's history of open-source development.  There is certainly evidence to the contrary. Btc1, as the Segwit2x software implementation is called, is hosted on GitHub where any developer is welcome to point out bugs and suggest improvements. This open process has indeed already led to major changes in the project's direction. Similarly, the mailing list is open for anyone in the community to at least peruse – if not post to.  In other ways, the effort is staying true to its secretive origin story.  There's an invite-only Slack group, where companies that originally pledged to contribute are represented, including Abra, Bitfury, BitGo, BitPay, Blockchain, Bloq, BTCC, Ledger, RSK Labs and Xapo.  Others included in the Slack group are OB1, Purse and developers from the alternative bitcoin implementation Bitcoin XT, which aimed to increase bitcoin's block size parameter to 8MB in 2015.  Most of these companies and individuals who have committed developer resources, though, declined to provide specific information in response to CoinDesk requests to understand their involvement. Some companies did not respond at all.  Others confirmed that they're involved in development, but declined to be more specific about which developers are involved and what they're working on.  Who and what?  ""We are also contributing technical expertise to the Segwit2x code, which is in its test phase right now on a separate testnet,"" said Valery Vavilov, CEO of The BitFury Group.  Many company responses were similarly vague.  Yet Vavilov continued:  ""We are also in the working group that is researching, building, reviewing and testing the upgrade, and will help businesses adopt the upgrade as well.""  Companies are currently testing the code on the newly-deployed testnet. On Thursday, the group released a public testnet faucet, which produces fake bitcoins that developers can use.  A number of developers are tuned into the effort, as seen on the GitHub and the Segwit2x project mailing list. Those two resources make it easy to see a few of the people involved in development, including posted contributions from Bloq CEO Jeff Garzik and Purse.io CTO Christopher Jeffrey.  While Digital Currency Group (DCG) CEO Barry Silbert is often viewed as the public face and linchpin of the effort (it’s often called the ""Silbert Agreement""), he noted he's ""not involved on the development side at all"", and so can't comment on the process any more than what's already been published.  Despite knowledge of the process, there are gaps in the community's understanding of what's being developed, such as who specifically is contributing to the effort and what they are contributing.  Missing peer review?  Those who are not contributing, according to Lightening Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark, are those who have disagreed with the proposal in some way.  Stark said her company provided technical feedback to Segwit2x because they didn't agree with the proposal for ""various technical reasons"". And according to Stark, they were not invited to participate further.  ""This proposal has like zero developer consensus,"" she said, referring to Bitcoin Core developers, most of whom have outright rejected the project.  She added:  ""Unfortunately, the [mailing] list is only for people that agree with Segwit2x.""  Again, opponents said, this philosophy contrasts with bitcoin's open development process so far, which invites all developers to contribute their ideas. A loose group of volunteer developers work on Bitcoin Core, for example, where development, for the most part, is done out in the open.  On the other hand, Segwit2x's closed approach to development ""allows people to self-vindicate, and shields you from peer review and public commentary,"" wrote Blockstream CEO Adam Back in an email to the working group.  He continued:  ""The forming of distinct and closed communication channels is not inviting review. Why would this project be special in needing to work in closed/controlled environments and not participate openly like the six or so other implementations and hundreds of developers across dozens of companies, institutions and individuals[?]""  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Abra, BitGo, BitPay, Blockstream, Bloq, BTCC, Ledger, OB1, Purse.io, RSK Labs and Xapo.

During a recent UN meeting in Germany, an official with the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) discussed how the tech could provide benefits as the world moves to adopt the Paris Climate Change Agreement, an accord struck last year aimed at reducing global carbon emissions.  A recent blog post detailing discussions at the UN meeting in May remarks that the organization could use the tech to create a transparent and efficient system that can monitor, for example, carbon emissions and clean energy trading, fund allocation. Blockchain could also be leveraged to ensure the accuracy of carbon emission reduction data.  Alexandre Gellert Paris, who serves as associate programme officer at the UNFCCC, said at the May meeting:  ""As countries, regions, cities and businesses work to rapidly implement the Paris Climate Change Agreement, they need to make use of all innovative and cutting-edge technologies available. Blockchain could contribute to greater stakeholder involvement, transparency and engagement and help bring trust and further innovative solutions in the fight against climate change, leading to enhanced climate actions.""  As the post details, however, the organization did not specify a concrete timeline for use in this area, only saying it's currently at the early research stage.  Yet it nonetheless highlights another possible use case for the UN, which has utilized the tech to advance its anti-poverty and humanitarian aid missions.  The idea of applying blockchain to the problem of carbon emissions has seen traction in the private sector as well.  As CoinDesk reported late last year, IBM has been working with a China-based firm to develop a prototype to track and monitor carbon assets trading among high energy-consuming companies in the country, which produces about a quarter of the world's carbon emissions.

42379536,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX88XsF,1498227313,"The FBI Received Over 2,600 Ransomware Complaints in 2016","The FBI received more than 2,600 complaints about ransomware last year, according to a new report.  Published yesterday, the annual review of cybersecurity threats from the law enforcement agency's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) outlined a range of statistics, including the number of submissions it received regarding ransomware.  Ransomware is a type of malicious software that encrypts an infected computer's data, demanding a payment – usually in bitcoin – in return for the information being unlocked.  According to the IC3's report, 2,673 complaints were submitted, with losses of over $2.4m reported during that period. The number represents a small fraction of the 298,728 cybercrime-related complaints that IC3 said it received overall in 2016. All told, losses in 2016 connected to these activities constituted a reported $1.3bn.  The IC3 disclosure comes on the heels of a global ransomware attack, dubbed WannaCry, that impacted hundreds of thousands of computers owned by a host of organizations, including the UK's National Health Service.  The impact of that spread is still being felt, according to recent reports.  Reuters said yesterday that Japanese automaker Honda had to temporarily close one of its manufacturing plants because WannaCry was discovered on one of its networks.

42379525,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX88XeP,1498222828,Coin Center: US Senate's Digital Currency Bill Is 'Counterproductive',"An anti-money laundering bill before the US Senate and focused in part on digital currencies ""could upset years of policy and compliance work"", according to Washington, DC, advocacy group Coin Center.  A new blog post penned by Coin Center executive director Jerry Brito dives into the specifics of the bill, arguing that the Combating Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Counterfeiting Act of 2017 – introduced in late May by a group of influential senators – largely replicates rules put in place by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which first issued guidance on digital currency activities in 2013 and later 2014.  According to Brito, the Senate bill's approach as written is ""counterproductive"" to its intended goal of countering illegal activities.  He wrote:  ""Almost all of the digital currency specific language in the bill is now covered under existing money laundering law, and, if left as drafted, the proposed changes would be counterproductive to combatting money laundering.""  In the post, Coin Center takes aim at the addition of ""issuer, redeemer, or cashier of ... digital currency ... or any digital exchanger or tumbler of digital currency"" to the definition of what constitutes a financial institution under the US Bank Secrecy Act, which was first instituted in the 1970s.  According to Brito, the addition is again redundant in the context of FinCEN rules, ""making this section of S. 1241 bill redundant with current law.""  ""Furthermore, if this language were to remain in S. 1241 it would introduce a lot of confusion by creating new language and categorizations that would now be incompatible with FinCEN's guidance and the years of compliance efforts that have emerged around that guidance,"" he continued.  A move that would potentially add confusion to the market, Brito argued, could have global implications as well, because the shift ""would be counterproductive for international harmonization and cooperation.""  Coin Center also honed in on fears that digital currency holdings could be subject to declaration and seizure at the US border, with Brito noting that, at present, the bill calls for a report on how customs agents might approach this process. The measure itself remains in the early stages, being referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee in late May, according to public records.  ""Detecting and interdicting such instruments is the kind of thing Congress expects these agencies to be able to do and to be able to explain how they plan to do it, and mandating such a report does not say anything about policy,"" Brito wrote.

42379527,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX88XiB,1498219221,Accounting Coalition Moves to Work with Regulators on Blockchain Innovation,"Accounting isn't typically thought of as an innovative field. Yet some of the largest accounting firms in the world are moving to ensure the industry isn’t held back from the benefits of blockchain by cumbersome regulation.  To that end, the Accounting Blockchain Coalition has announced the formation of five working groups aimed to help guide the creation of global accounting standards and devise plans for helping regulators gain familiarity with blockchain's potential use in the industry.  Speaking prior to the announcement at the Blockchain Accounting Audit & Tax Conference on 22nd June, Griffin Anderson, head of blockchain accounting at blockchain startup ConsenSys and founding member of the coalition, told CoinDesk:  ""[The groups] are there to support the regulatory bodies and standard setting bodies around the globe and help them, advise them to deliver this technology throughout their institutions.""  Participants of the working groups will be limited to those participating in the coalition, according to Anderson, who added that further details about the topics to be addressed by the groups will be released later this week.  Catching up  While regulators around the world have begun making public statements about their intentions to regulate blockchain in the accounting space, large-scale guidance still appears to be years away.  And while blockchain is already starting to impact accounting – a fact addressed in panels at the conference that included representatives from PwC, Deloitte, EY, KPMG, Accenture, SAP and Grant Thornton – the industry is at the very early stages of innovating with the tech.  “We’re in the first inning, and accounting hasn’t even come up to bat,” said Scott Zimmerman a partner at ""Big Four"" accounting firm EY.  Even so, several major accounting firms have taken a proactive stance on the nascent technology.  PwC, for example, sponsored the ID2020 event held at the United Nations last week, and one of its principals, Grainne McNamara, is increasingly being recognized for her support of public blockchain technology like that which powers bitcoin and ethereum.  At the event, McNamara alluded to multiple ""live engagements"" PwC is currently undertaking to explore the role her firm could play in a world shaped by blockchain. She also elaborated on the single most commonly pursued use case asked about by PwC's customers.  ""Supply chain is getting the most attention,"" she said. ""Every single client we sit down with we can absolutely find a [supply chain] use case that provides value to the client and their customers.""  Even though individual accounting firms have taken only baby steps so far, Anderson thinks collaboration will be key in making sure regulation doesn't fall behind innovation.  He said:  ""We need everyone to come together under a neutral umbrella.""  Accounting & accountability  Part of that collaboration on blockchain means having the ability to hold others accountable, according to Iddo Bentov, co-founder of the Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Contracts (IC3), who spoke at the conference.  Bentov, also a postdoc at Cornell University, explained that blockchain offers ""more potential"" for accountability tracking than the centralized systems the accounting industry uses today.  He said:  ""Right now, in the real world, there is no decentralized system where everybody has to be held accountable.""  Bentov and ConsenSys founder Joe Lubin spent time discussing the merits of platforms including ethereum, Corda and zcash. According to Lubin, by adding some ethereum-based solutions, such as triple-entry platform Balanc3 (already in place at several companies around the world), even relatively basic accounting tasks can be performed with accountability in mind.  While progress on such efforts continues to be made, Lubin conceded that, for now, accounting firms are only looking for low-hanging fruit use cases for blockchain.

42379538,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX88Xul,1498215640,Ukrainian Government to Start Blockchain Land Registry Trial in October,"The government of Ukraine has revealed plans to trial a land registry system underpinned by blockchain.  In a government meeting on Wednesday, Maksym Martyniuk, First Deputy Minister of Agricultural Policy and Food, unveiled the pilot project, planned to start in October. According to local media reports, the scheme will introduce blockchain to the Eastern European country's State Land Cadastre and digitize auctions for leases of state land.  The news follows Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman's recent commitment to hold auctions for all state land leases going forward – a move aimed to increase competition, boost the local economy and reduce illicit activities. Warning of potential ""criminal punishment"" for non-compliance with the policy, the Prime Minister said at the time:  ""Any land that is provided must be provided at auctions.”  About 71% of Ukrainian territory (42.7 million hectares) falls under the category of agricultural land. Over 10 million hectares of this is owned by the state, comprising around 25% of the total amount of agricultural land.  According to a 2015 research project financed by the World Bank and launched in cooperation with the Ministry of Agricultural Policy of Ukraine, the State Land Cadaster Center and a number of state authorities, the current state of land management in Ukraine is alarming:  Public land registration is considerably lower than for private property (24% vs 71%), reducing transparency and allowing for illicit activities.  The level of lease payment for agricultural land is one of the lowest in Europe and the Russian Commonwealth (about $37 in 2015), negatively affecting the incomes of rural landowners and causing inefficient use of land resources.  The land market is very depressed, mainly due to the lack of financial instruments and the complexities of using land as collateral. The main way of transferring property rights to agricultural land is via leases, where there is a big ""shadow market.""  The number of land taxpayers (about 7.3 million) is much lower than the number of private landowners and land users.  Ukraine is not the first country to consider using blockchain in the land registry process. In March this year, Sweden’s land registry authority launched a trial for recording property deals. And, in May, the UK Land Registry detailed its plans for a so-called 'Digital Street', listing blockchain technology as one of the underlying technologies for the trial.

Huobi Launches Quantitative Model for Investors,"Beijing-based cryptocurrency exchange Huobi has released a quantitative analysis model that evaluates different blockchain-based currencies using a range of variables.  Named SMARTChainhttps://www.huobi.com/topic/index.php?a=eth_report and designed with support from academics, the model intends to serve as a guide for global investors who have an interest in cryptocurrencies and a need for a more scientific way to appraise each platform's differences. Currently in beta, the results of the model will be updated monthly and quarterly to focus on those with the highest market capitalization – the value of all their issued tokens combined.  Lending weight to the project, is that Tsinghua University, one of the most prestigious institutions in China, had its School of Finance design the evaluation model. It ultimately decided to use five variables for the analysis: a blockchain's relevance for real-life applications; its public and media attention; its trading volume; its credibility and risk for inflation; and its technological design.  Evaluated ultimately by the Huobi Blockchain Research Center, the model assigns scores to each blockchain in order to generate a final top-20 ranking.  Bitcoin, ethereum and litecoin, for example, ranked in top three in an initial analysis, garnering scores of 88.07, 70.67 and 69.62 points respectively. Ripple and ethereum classic came fourth and fifth, respectively.  According to the tool's creators, the scores suggest how much potential each cryptocurrency has as a long-term investment. Interestingly, perhaps, the three top tokens are also the only cryptocurrencies that can be traded on Huobi, where litecoin dominates volume, followed by ether and bitcoin  Still, as the model has only just launched, those involved admit its accuracy and efficiency remain to be seen.
