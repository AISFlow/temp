29958216,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626363,1719356440,Solana Eyes $200 Rebound As New Adoption-Driving Technology Debuts,"The Solana Foundation recently launched two new tools to facilitate the integration of Web3 capabilities into mainstream platforms and the adoption of blockchain. In a series of social media posts, the foundation launched “Actions” and “Blockchain Links” (Blinks), which, according to the announcement, is a step forward in allowing developers to build blockchain functionality into websites and social media platforms. Alongside these developments, the Solana ecosystem continues to expand its tooling and services, with notable advancements in transaction cost reduction and network efficiency. Seamless Web3 Transactions? Actions, one of the newly introduced tools, allows users to engage in Web3-native transactions, including asset transfers, non-fungible token (NFT) interactions, voting, betting, and tipping content creators. Complementing Actions, Blinks allows developers to format any Action into a shareable link, transforming websites and social media platforms into practical entry points for blockchain interactions. These tools reportedly provide an important bridge between traditional web applications and decentralized finance (DeFi), facilitating the integration of blockchain capabilities into everyday digital experiences. Related Reading: Crypto Research Firm Says Bitcoin Crash Below $60,000 May Not Be The End, Here’s Why In addition, to optimize transaction costs, Light Protocol and Helius Labs recently launched a testnet for ZK Compression on the Solana network. ZK Compression uses zero-knowledge proofs and call data to reduce the cost of transactions on the network. By minimizing the amount of on-chain data stored, ZK Compression enables considerable fee savings by reducing the computational demand of Solana transactions. Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Helius Labs, estimates that ZK Compression can cut the cost of airdropping tokens to one million users on Solana from $260,000 to just $50, providing a compelling, cost-efficient solution. Mumtaz further stated: example cost difference: take an airdrop to 1,000,000 users. This today would cost over $260,000 for state alone. Now, it’s $50 — 5,200x cheaper. But a token account is just one example of this — *everything* on Solana is an account, meaning everything can be scaled. ZK Compression On Solana While ZK Compression has garnered praise for its cost-saving potential, critics from the Ethereum community argue that it functions as a Layer 2 (L2) solution, contrary to Solana’s anti-Layer 2 ethos. Some skeptics contend that ZK Compression essentially operates as an L2 feature or a validity-based rollup. Adam Cochran, VP of Operations at SBT Partners, stated that ZK Compression is an L2 solution. In response, Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana’s co-founder, highlighted that ZK Compression addresses many issues commonly associated with Ethereum-based L2 solutions. Yakovenko emphasized its independence from security council multisigs, chain ID switches, governance tokens, and external sequencers while ensuring Solana validators receive transaction fees. SOL Price Analysis SOL experienced a temporary dip on Monday, with its price reaching a low of $122. However, crypto analyst “Skew A” has examined SOL’s 4-hour chart and pointed out its rebound, surpassing the recovery of other large tokens. According to “Skew A,” specific factors need to be considered when assessing SOL’s potential uptrend and price recovery. Firstly, SOL’s price movement above the 1-day 200MA (Moving Average) is a positive signal. This suggests the token’s value is trending above the average price over the past 200 days, indicating a potentially bullish sentiment. Furthermore, confirmation of SOL’s upward trend would involve observing higher highs (HH) above $150. Related Reading: 10x Your Crypto Portfolio: Top Analyst Highlights 4 Altcoins To Buy In the past 24 hours, SOL has notably recovered with a 9% increase, bringing its current trading price to $138. This upward movement positions the token favorably as it aims to surpass key resistance levels on its path toward consolidating above the significant milestone of $200. To reach the $200 mark, SOL must overcome and successfully breach major resistance walls at $150, $162, $174, and $186. These levels represent significant hurdles that must be surpassed before potentially breaking through the crucial $200 threshold. It remains to be seen whether the ongoing momentum and positive developments within the Solana ecosystem will sustain SOL’s current recovery and enable it to retest the higher price levels achieved in recent months.

29955403,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626343,1719351055,"Will Bitcoin Have A ‘Red Monday, Green Week’? Analyst Sets $63,500 Target","Bitcoin (BTC) faced a sharp price drop as the last week of Q2 began. The dramatic decline saw the flagship cryptocurrency momentarily lose its support above the $60,000 level on Monday. Related Reading: Bitcoin Takes A Beating: Another $630 Million Exits, Price Drops Lower The drop left many investors wondering whether the bullish rally is over. However, crypto analysts remain optimistic about BTC’s performance and consider the drag down to be part of the quarterly retest. Is Bitcoin Headed For A ‘Chop Summer’? On Tuesday, crypto analyst Jelle made a case for Bitcoin’s bullish momentum. Amid the bearish sentiment from some community sectors, the crypto investor believes BTC’s bull run isn’t over. Per Jelle’s posts, Bitcoin has been holding key support levels despite its brief fall under $60,000. Additionally, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization displays a “still firmly bullish” higher-timeframe structure. This structure exhibits BTC’s performance consistently, making higher highs (HH) and higher lows (HL) for the last year and a half. Per the chart, the price drop remains a higher low than the May 1 retrace, which remains the deepest this cycle. Jelly criticized those who send “hate” to bullish investors, highlighting that “Bitcoin has consistently moved higher for nearly 20 months.” He suggested that “In a bull market, conviction pays.” Moreover, he pointed out that the flagship cryptocurrency exhibits a bullish flag below all-time high levels. To the analyst, this consolidation could play out similarly to the consolidation below the $30,000 resistance range. If it were to happen, Bitcoin would see a “chop summer” below the new key resistance, the $74,000 ATH price, before breaking out. According to Jelle, the breakout could cost BTC $100,000. Quarterly Retest: ‘Red Monday, Green Week’? Despite the long-term forecast, Jelle set a $63,500 target for this week. During Monday’s drop, the analyst stated that BTC’s performance was playing out like it was in 2016-2017. Furthermore, pointed out that Bitcoin’s key support level of $58,000 is “doing its job” during this “quarterly retrace.” To Jelle, BTC can “lock in a lower-timeframe higher low” this Tuesday. As a result, the analyst considers that bulls can run the flagship cryptocurrency to $63,500 by the end of the week. Jelle also believes Bitcoin could surpass its weekly open, making it a “Red Monday, Green Week.” Altcoin Sherpa also suggested that BTC could reach the weekly open. Per the analyst, the current range remains a “bounce region,” which could return the price to $64,000. He expects this performance to relieve altcoins, although he doesn’t consider it “THE bottom.” Related Reading: ‘Crypto Winter’ Arrives Early For The Altcoin Market As Venture Capital, Founder Selloffs Mount Sherpa believes there will be more volatility before the local bottom: “4h EMAs all bearish; expecting price to pull back when we see it interact with them at 64kish.” To the analyst, BTC’s local bottom will come in the next few days and could test the May 1 retrace levels. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $61,700, representing a 4.5% recovery from Monday’s pullback.

29952521,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626332,1719345610,"Pundit Is Undeterred By The Solana Price Crash, Says Price Is Headed For $1,000","The Solana bearish price action might be coming to a close, as many cryptocurrencies have started to show mixed price action in the past 24 hours. Dialing the price action further back shows Solana has been mostly bearish and has been on a price decline since the beginning of the month. Notably, the crypto recently reached a 30-day low of $123.96, representing a 29% decline from a monthly high of $174.65. However, some proponents remain undeterred and are still looking forward to a bullish Solana on the long run. Particularly, an interesting prediction from crypto analyst Crypto Patel puts the price of Solana rising to $1,000 in the long term. Solana To $1000? Crypto Patel, mostly known for his Bitcoin takes, recently dropped a brief analysis on social media platform X regarding Solana’s price trajectory. According to his Solana/TetherUS 1 week timeframe chart, Solana’s price formation on the long-term seems to lead up to a surge towards $1,000. Notably, the chart shows the formation of a giant cup and handle pattern, which is generally considered a bullish pattern. Related Reading: Analysts Battle Over Cardano’s Next Move: 12,000% Rally Or 50% Crash? Solana has been on a U-formation since 2022, with a recent six-month surge since October 2023 completing the other side of the U cup. However, the pattern shows a prevailing neck line resistance around SOL’s current all-time high of $259, leading to the start of the handle pattern. According to the technical analysis, this handle pattern is expected to be completed sometime around late 2025. Following its completion, Solana will have the opportunity to break through this neckline resistance at some point in 2026, which would initiate a surge to new all-time highs. The first price target is around $430, and the second is just above $1,000, representing gains of 220% and 640%, respectively, from the current price levels. As explained above, the analyst’s technical analysis is more of a long-term outlook than on a short-term price prediction. This serves more as a strategic roadmap for the next few years. Related Reading: SkyBridge Capital’s Scaramucci Says Bitcoin Will Reach $250,000 Is This US Presidential Candidate Wins It’s important to note that while Crypto Patel’s final SOL price target might be ultra-bullish, the path to attaining it looks very tough. Surprisingly, the analysis suggests that Solana could fall to as low as $46 during the formation of the handle pattern, a price that might not resonate well with Solana bulls. At the time of writing, Solana is trading at $136 and is 9% in the past 24 hours as the bulls look to undo a month long price decline. According to price history, investors can look forward to Solana kickstarting a bullish price action in July. This is because Solana has registered price increases in July for the past six years.

While this corrective phase has seen Bitcoin’s price fall to as low as $58,000 yesterday, it has partially rebounded, currently trading around the $61,500 mark. However, the journey could be smoother, as ongoing liquidations and market adjustments pose challenges. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bottom In? Here’s What 7 Experts Say Analyzing The Depth Of Current Market Correction Woo’s insights highlight that Bitcoin’s market correction hasn’t been done despite the recent recovery. Particularly, the market continues to grapple with the impact of post-halving miner capitulations and the high costs associated with mining hardware upgrades. These factors contribute to the ongoing pressure on weaker miners, forcing them out of the market and potentially leading to further price drops. According to Woo, while Bitcoin has slightly recovered, the overall market sentiment remains cautious. Technical indicators suggest that although Bitcoin could rebound from recent lows, there is still potential for a further drop. Short term technicals point to a reversal playing out here. 2 hours away from a TD9 reversal on daily candles. If this plays out, then we go into a hidden bullish divergence to correct for the overselling of the market. pic.twitter.com/TPWRhmeGYn — Willy Woo (@woonomic) June 24, 2024 Woo predicts that Bitcoin could see a descent to $54,000 if current support levels fail. This key threshold may trigger another round of liquidations and potentially usher in a bearish phase for short-term holders. The importance of this price level lies in its role as a demarcation line between bearish and bullish market regimes. Falling below it, especially given the current macroeconomic setup, could significantly affect Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Bitcoin Bearish Market Ongoing, But Don’t Despair Adding to the conversation, Billy Markus, co-creator of Dogecoin, shares a somewhat philosophical take on handling the current crypto market’s bearish phase. He advises investors to view their crypto investments with detachment, likening it to “throwing money into a fire.” Such a mindset, he argues, could help weather the emotional rollercoaster of market ups and downs.

Bitwise Chief Investment Officer (CIO) Matt Hougan has weighed in on the potential of these ETFs, predicting substantial inflows into the regulated market within the first months of trading. Market Data Suggests $15B Demand For Spot Ethereum ETFs Hougan’s projections are based on a thorough analysis of available data. He emphasizes that there is no need for speculation when estimating the demand for spot Ethereum ETFs. Instead, Hougan points to the existing market data to support his forecast of $15 billion in net inflows during the initial 18-month period. To arrive at this estimate, Hougan compares the relative market capitalizations of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). As a starting point, he expects investors to allocate to Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded products (ETPs) roughly in proportion to their market capitalizations. Related Reading: 10x Your Crypto Portfolio: Top Analyst Highlights 4 Altcoins To Buy Bitcoin’s market cap currently stands at $1,266 billion, representing 74% of the combined market, while Ethereum’s market cap is $432 billion, accounting for 26% of the combined market. Considering US investors already have around $56 billion invested in spot Bitcoin ETPs, Hougan anticipates reaching $100 billion or more by the end of 2025 as these ETFs mature and gain approval on prominent platforms such as Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch. Using this $100 billion benchmark, he suggests that spot Ethereum ETFs would need to attract $35 billion in assets to achieve parity, which he estimates will take approximately 18 months. However, Hougan acknowledges that the actual inflows may differ due to various factors. For instance, the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) is expected to convert to an ETP on the launch day, bringing along $10 billion in assets. Factoring this in, the estimated net inflows to reach parity would be around $25 billion. Analysis Of International ETF Markets To validate his estimates, Hougan looks at international ETF markets, particularly Europe and Canada, which already offer Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. The asset split between the two cryptocurrencies in these markets is similar, according to Hougan, with Bitcoin ETPs accounting for approximately 78% and Ethereum ETPs representing around 22% of the total Assets Under Management (AUM). This alignment with market cap breakdowns strengthens Hougan’s earlier estimate. Hougan also considers the potential impact of the “carry trade” on Bitcoin and Ethereum ETP markets. While a significant fraction of US Bitcoin ETP flows are linked to the carry trade strategy, he highlights that the Ethereum ETP carry trade is not profitable for institutions. To maintain a conservative estimate, Hougan removes the $10 billion carry-trade-related AUM when sizing the Bitcoin market, leading to a revised estimate of $15 billion in net inflows for Ethereum ETPs. Related Reading: Analysts Battle Over Cardano’s Next Move: 12,000% Rally Or 50% Crash? In sum, Hougan believes that while there are several factors to consider and potential adjustments to the model, a starting point of $15 billion in net new demand for spot Ethereum ETFs within the next 18 months is a reasonable projection. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $3,405, up nearly 3% in the past 24 hours, after hitting a low of $3,230 on Monday.

42417884,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTbr2b,1719335817,Solana Adds 'Blinks' and 'Actions' so Users Can Trade Crypto on Their Favorite Social Apps,"The Solana blockchain has been the epicenter of crypto's latest ""meme coin"" frenzy, and a new set of features for the chain – so-called Actions and Blinks – could help make meme coins and other buzzy blockchain trends accessible to a wider audience.  Developed by the Solana Foundation in partnership with the Solana development shop Dialect, Blinks and Actions allow people to transact on blockchains directly from within the websites and social platforms they use every day.  ""Solana Actions allow users to execute on-chain transactions across various platforms, including websites, social media and physical QR codes,"" the Solana Foundation explained in a statement to CoinDesk. ""Actions make it simple for developers to integrate everything you can do in the Solana ecosystem right into their applications.""  The tech will be supported by popular Solana wallets like Phantom and Backpack right out of the gate, and other platforms will be able to integrate it by following implementation instructions in the chain's developer docs.  Meme coin traders buy and sell digital assets fashioned after everything from old-school internet memes to political figures. Solana has been the biggest hub for meme coins lately, serving as the home for such assets as Australian rapper Iggy Azalea's viral Mother token ($MOTHER), which sits at a $70 million market cap less than a month out from its June launch, and dogwifhat ($WIF), the breakout star of the 2024 meme coin craze, which boasts a market cap above $2 billion.  Although meme coins have many naysayers (meme coin trading sometimes resembles gambling more than it does investing), some crypto advocates think the hype around them could help carry blockchains further into the mainstream.  But for blockchains to become ubiquitous, the tech underlying them desperately needs an upgrade. Complicated wallet software and hard-to-navigate trading platforms continue to make meme coin trading—and crypto trading in general—hard to access for newcomers.  That's where Solana's new features come in.  ""Actions and blinks on Solana allow any website and application on the internet to be a distribution point for on-chain interactions – furthering the goal of mainstream adoption,” said Jon Wong, the Solana Foundation's head of ecosystem engineering.  For example, a person could embed an ""action"" into an X post that references a particular memecoin. Users who see the post could click on it and immediately initiate a transaction on Solana, adding the token to their own blockchain wallet. Users can also use ""blinks"" (a portmanteau of ""blockchain"" and ""link"") to share actions from other users with their own followings.  ""From your X feed, you can buy an NFT, tip a creator, receive money, vote, stake, swap, and so much more."" says Chris Osborn, founder of Dialect.  Accessibility has long been blockchain's Achilles heel, and the new Solana features follow similar moves from other ecosystems.  Blinks and actions share a close resemblance, for instance, to Farcaster – the X-like social platform on Coinbase's Base blockchain. Farcaster users can easily embed direct links to blockchain assets in their posts, and specialized Fascaster clients like Kiosk – an up-and-coming utility from the creators of Web3 publishing platform Mirror – make blink-like calls-to-action a core selling point.  Farcaster, Kiosk and Solana are all clearly motivated by the fact that social media platforms are at the forefront of crypto culture—where users go to exchange memes, news and trading opportunities. Solana's tech differs in that it plugs blockchain functionality into existing Web2 social apps rather than new, standalone Web3 apps.  ""This makes so much sense in a social media feed,"" Osborn told CoinDesk, but the Dialect founder hopes Actions could eventually disrupt how the web works at its very core.  ""Delivering these actions into feeds like X, Reddit, maybe Discord soon – these other platforms where people want to have these Actions experiences – is just the beginning,"" said Osborn. ""What I'm really excited about is, what's the non-skeuomorphic true 'Web3' internet equivalent of this? We don't know what that is, but I think this idea of actions is what's at the core.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/06/25/solana-adds-blinks-and-actions-so-users-can-trade-crypto-on-their-favorite-social-apps,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e0942b10edf5e8c8248e73bef34f1bd2bd7520e5-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Shiba Inu, Solana, & Cardano Form Buy Signal Following Market Crash In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about how a Tom Demark (TD) Sequential signal has formed for Shiba Inu, Solana, and Cardano recently. The “TD Sequential” here refers to an indicator in technical analysis (TA) that’s generally used for finding probable points of reversal in any asset’s price. This indicator typically involves two phases: setup and countdown. In the first of these, the setup, successive candles of the same color are counted up to nine. Once the chart has registered these nine candles, the price may be assumed to have hit a position of turnaround. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forms Bullish Signal That Led To At Least 60% Jump Last 3 Times Naturally, if the setup has completed with green candles, then the asset could be considered to have reached a top. Similarly, if it has finished with a downtrend, the price may be heading towards a rebound to the upside. Once the setup is done, the countdown phase begins. This second phase looks much like the first one, except for the fact that it involves thirteen candles of the same type, rather than nine. When the countdown is over with, the asset could be assumed to have reached another potential point of reversal. It would appear that three altcoins, Shiba Inu, Solana, and Cardano, have just completed a TD Sequential phase of the former type in their daily charts. Here are the graphs shared by the analyst that show this signal forming in the prices of these cryptocurrencies: As is visible in each chart, these altcoins have formed this TD Sequential pattern with red candles, meaning that the indicator is now giving a buy signal for them. The signal has appeared for Shiba Inu and company as a result of the downtrend that they have been experiencing recently. Respite may finally be here for these assets, though, if the indicator is to be believed. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Switching To Risk-Off Mode After $61,000 Crash In fact, since the buy signal has emerged, the coins have already started on a rebound. Among these, Solana has particularly stood out with its 9% jump in the past 24 hours. It now remains to be seen how long this renewed uptrend will last for these coins, especially for Cardano and Shiba Inu, who have so far only seen surges of 5% and 4%, respectively. SHIB Price The past month has been a terrible time for Shiba Inu investors as the memecoin has declined by more than 30% in this period, which has sent its price down to $0.0000173.

The firm also outlined several factors that support this bearish outlook. Bitcoin Could Drop To As Low As $50,000 10x Research’s lead analyst Markus Thielen mentioned in the report that Bitcoin could drop to as low as $50,000. He highlighted a topping formation for the flagship crypto that could lead to this steep decline. Thielen noted how Bitcoin had been range trading for a while now, a pattern that is often marked by several false breakouts. Related Reading: SkyBridge Capital’s Scaramucci Says Bitcoin Will Reach $250,000 Is This US Presidential Candidate Wins However, with BTC shifting into a topping formation, the research warned that such a pattern has usually left “the average retail investors vulnerable, with many altcoins experiencing significant drops” alongside Bitcoin. Thielen further highlighted $61,500 as an important price level that Bitcoin needs to hold above, as the flagship crypto trading below this level will confirm the potential drop to $50,000. 10x Research also mentioned several factors that support this bearish outlook. One is the lack of new money flowing into the crypto market. Instead, there have been net outflows with the US Spot Bitcoin ETFs, for example, recording $1.2 billion in net outflows since June 10. Traders have also suffered significant liquidations, with $0.8 billion and $0.9 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum positions wiped out from the crypto market this past week. Ethereum’s low network activity is another factor supporting 10x Researh’s bearish Bitcoin outlook. Transaction fees on Ethereum are currently at their lowest since 2020, suggesting that investors haven’t been keen on trading on the network for a while now despite the Dencun upgrade, which helped lower gas fees. Many Bitcoin miners are also said to be approaching break-even costs, which is also concerning considering the amount of sell pressure these miners can put on BTC. These miners are already reported to have sold over 30,000 BTC ($2 billion) this month, contributing to Bitcoin’s decline. History Suggests BTC Won’t Drop To As Low As $50,000 Crypto analyst Rekt Capital recently mentioned that Bitcoin should be able to hold above $60,000 based on its historical patterns. He stated that BTC has never lost its re-accumulation range low as support in the post-halving period, with $60,000 currently serving as the re-accumulation range low. Related Reading: Analysts Battle Over Cardano’s Next Move: 12,000% Rally Or 50% Crash? Meanwhile, Rekt Capital mentioned that a longer bull run is on the cards, seeing as Bitcoin’s rate of acceleration has already dropped from 260 days to 160. He also noted that Bitcoin has continued to reduce the rate of acceleration in this cycle through this consolidation in the reaccumulation range.

29941075,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626284,1719324026,10x Your Crypto Portfolio: Top Analyst Highlights 4 Altcoins To Buy,"In a new video titled “If I Had To 10X My Money, I’d Only Hold These 4 Altcoins!” aimed at shedding light on potential bull market leaders, renowned crypto analyst Miles Deutscher dissected the crypto landscape to pinpoint four altcoins that he believes could significantly outperform the market. His insights came in response to a query from his Discord channel about potential 5x to 10x gains during the current bull market. Deutscher believes that success in the crypto markets doesn’t necessarily come from holding a vast array of coins but rather from carefully selecting a few that have strong potential narratives. He articulated this during his presentation, stating, “You don’t need to own 30, 40, 50, 60 altcoins in order to get your desired returns. In fact, if you select the right coins and pick the right narratives, you could potentially succeed in this market with three, four, or five altcoins.” He also provided strategic insights into the typical market behaviors during the summer, a period he describes as a regular seasonal downturn across the crypto industry. He used historical data to support his claim, emphasizing that even during bullish years, cryptocurrencies have suffered during the summer months. Deutscher reassured his viewers by saying, “Even in the most bullish years for crypto, like 2021, majors were looking really bad during summer months so why would you now start to panic?” Deutscher’s Top 4 Altcoin Picks Deutscher chose coins based on their potential for significant returns and their strategic position within the market: #1 Ethereum: ETH holds the premier position in Miles Deutscher’s selection due to its established role as the leading smart contract platform in the crypto sphere. Ethereum’s upcoming catalysts, particularly the anticipated approval of US spot Ethereum ETFs, are seen as significant potential value drivers. Deutscher underscores its importance by stating, “Ethereum sits at a $428 billion fully diluted valuation versus Bitcoin which sits at $1.2 trillion. I think Ethereum is at a reasonable market cap now.” Related Reading: ‘Crypto Winter’ Arrives Early For The Altcoin Market As Venture Capital, Founder Selloffs Mount He doesn’t predict a 10x return from Ethereum in this cycle, but he values its potential for steady growth, making it a cornerstone in a well-diversified crypto portfolio. Deutscher further supports his choice by noting the technical aspects: “Ethereum has been in a strong uptrend all the way since $1,500,” indicating its resilience and bullish trends. #2 Pepe: PEPE, a meme coin with a strong cultural footprint, is Deutscher’s second pick. He believes Pepe could perform exceptionally well in a favorable market environment, driven by its strong mindshare and position as a leading meme coin alongside giants like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Deutscher explains, “Pepe is not only the strongest proxy to trade Ethereum’s risk-on proxy that is, but it’s also one of the meme coins in the market with the strongest mind share behind DOGE and SHIB.” #3 Solana: SOL is chosen for its technological prowess and its significant adoption among developers and users in the crypto community. Deutscher views Solana as a potent mix of innovation and market potential, saying, “Solana has been the home of meme coins, it’s been the home of degeneracy. It’s made strides in terms of its technology adoption, lots of devs building on Solana.” He acknowledges the high valuation of Solana but suggests it offers a favorable risk-reward balance, predicting that “SOL could potentially go to $1,000 in a really crazy market.” Solana’s potential to scale and its strong community engagement positions it as a robust candidate for substantial mid-term gains. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crash To $61,000 Drives 24-Hour Crypto Liquidations Toward $300 Million #4 WIF: Dogwifhat complements Solana in Deutscher’s portfolio, serving as the meme coin counterpart to Solana’s technological base. WIF, according to Deutscher, balances the conservatism of more established coins like Ethereum and Solana with a higher risk and potentially higher return profile. He believes WIF is a key player in the meme coin sector and a strategic pick for those looking to capitalize on volatile market segments. He remarks on its performance and strategic positioning, “WIF has been a major sell-off; it’s actually trading below a major range low […] But if you believe in WIF like I do as a cycle long meme coin bet and a Solana play, you could just average in the lower it goes.” Crypto Investment Strategy And Practical Advice Deutscher’s overarching strategy blends conservative, foundational investments with higher-risk, potentially high-reward opportunities. He advocates for a portfolio construction that involves a strategic division between core holdings (80%-90%) and speculative bets (10%-20%). This approach, he argues, allows investors to capitalize on the upside while managing risk effectively. Reflecting on the importance of market timing and portfolio positioning, Deutscher advised his audience, “It’s about accumulating on major dips […] and it doesn’t really matter what happens in the interim.” He emphasizes long-term gains over short-term fluctuations, advising investors to stay the course through market ups and downs.

29940582,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626321,1719323099,Brett Surges Almost 20% as New Base Chain Meme Coin DAWGZ Hits $2M in ICO,"The Base blockchain continues to grow – with two joke tokens making headlines this week. Brett (BRETT), Base’s largest meme coin, has surged almost 20% in the past 24 hours. Hot on its tail, newcomer Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) is also causing a stir, having raised over $2 million since its ICO went live at the beginning of the month. BRETT Bounces Back – Is This Just the Beginning? BRETT is turning heads with its recent price action. After a period of uncertainty, BRETT has bounced back, currently trading at $0.155. Earlier today, the token even touched $0.162 before pulling back slightly, showing that it still has the potential to explode. All of this bullishness came after BRETT rejected the $0.130 support level. However, despite this rejection, the momentum seems to be slowing – suggesting that the initial excitement might be cooling off. Zooming out, BRETT is still stuck in a range on the higher timeframes. The 4-hour chart also showcases the token’s indecision, with the price unable to decide whether it wants to stay above or below the 50-period exponential moving average (EMA). Despite this indecision, there’s no denying traders’ interest. Spot volumes are up 53% since yesterday, showing that traders are paying more attention to BRETT. BRETT has even leapfrogged Book of Meme (BOME) in the market cap rankings. Why Are Investors Flocking to Base Meme Coins? It’s not just BRETT making waves on the Base blockchain. The entire Base meme coin market is surging, with its total value rising 10% to over $2 billion in the past day. Trading volumes are also on the up – now at $140 million. While BRETT, DEGEN, and TOSHI continue to dominate the conversation, newcomers are quickly making their mark. BENJI, for instance, has been rocketing up the charts, proving there’s always room for new players. But what’s driving the meme coin mania on Base? For starters, Base’s layer-2 architecture offers much lower transaction fees than Ethereum’s mainnet. This makes it an attractive playground for developers and traders looking to capitalize on the demand for meme coins. Add to that Base’s growing user base – now at over 500,000 daily active users – and you’ve got a recipe for viral growth. Base total value locked (TVL) has also rocketed to $1.5 billion. These figures show why Base has become a breeding ground for meme coins in 2024. Could Base Dawgz be the Next Big Base Meme Coin? Alongside BRETT, another Base meme coin is making headlines this week. Base Dawgz has just sailed past the $2 million milestone in its ICO, showcasing the enormous interest from retail investors. Importantly, the buzz around Base Dawgz isn’t just because of its ICO success. Social media platforms are also red-hot with chatter about this meme coin, with the project’s Twitter page now at 4,000 followers. Most of the excitement is about DAWGZ’s multi-chain capabilities. Imagine buying DAWGZ tokens on Base, quickly transferring them to Ethereum to take advantage of a new DeFi opportunity, and then zipping over to Solana to trade. This is what the Base Dawgz developers have in mind. Adding to the buzz is the project’s Share-to-Earn protocol. It’s turning meme-making into a lucrative hobby, with community members earning points for creating and sharing DAWGZ-related content. These points can later be exchanged for DAWGZ tokens – creating a self-fulfilling hype cycle. Base Dawgz’s whitepaper has also caught the eye of investors. It outlines plans for DEX listings, marketing pushes, and mysterious “community rewards.” Ultimately, as the Base ecosystem grows, meme coins like Base Dawgz are perfectly positioned to benefit. Whether DAWGZ will be the next BRETT is anyone’s guess – but it’s certainly ticking all the right boxes.

The company has already deployed $2.75 million to 11 different companies.  Colosseum, the recently launched startup accelerator that organizes hackathons for the Solana ecosystem, raised $60 million for a fund that will invest in early-stage projects, the company announced Tuesday.  The fund, which was oversubscribed, will focus on pre-seed investments in selected startups from the winners of Solana Hackathons. ""It's evident that there is a market demand for novel, specialized venture products in crypto, and we are excited to have a diverse group of investors, including ecosystem founders and hackathon alumni, alongside us to realize our vision for Colosseum,"" said Clay Robbins, co-founder of Colosseum, in a statement.  When asked about what attracted investors to the fund, given the large sum of money that Colosseum raised, Robbins said, ""many of Colosseum’s LPs are agnostic to ecosystem but believe in the team’s immediate thesis that the Solana ecosystem has the most potential. Institutional LPs invest with both the current focus on the future in mind for what the model can become – so not necessarily a fund focused on one ecosystem, but more so this model.""  The accelerator sees hackathons – events where developers and founders come together to innovate – as the ""crucible"" for crypto innovation and company formation. According to the statement, it hosted its first Solana hackathon earlier this year, which attracted over 8,000 participants.  “Our hackathons are designed to level the playing field for builders globally to experiment with crypto product development and launch onchain startups,” explained Matty Taylor, co-founder of Colosseum and former head of growth of Solana Foundation.  Colosseum has funded 11 companies and deployed $2.75 million so far, Robbins added.  Among the investors, Bonk DAO – a 12-person council of Solana power brokers who manage $124 million worth of BONK token – said earlier this year that it plans to invest $500,000 in the fund.

Holding steady in the face of varying market sentiments, TON’s price stability has attracted attention from investors and analysts alike. This resilience raises a critical question, can TON maintain its strength and continue to thrive as the market potentially enters a tougher phase, often referred to as the crypto winter?

This article examines the price action of TON in detail to assess if the market of the crypto asset will continue to be optimistic or whether further gains are likely before a decline. Analyzing TON’s Performance Amidst Crypto Fluctuations On the 4-hour chart, the price of TON is actively bullish, and an upward move toward the $7.7 resistance level is being attempted. This followed after the price failed to break below the bullish trend line. It should also be noted here that the asset is actively trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) which suggests that TON might extend its upward trajectory. With the signal line of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) trending above 50% after an unsuccessfully attempted drop below it, the indicator confirmed the above claim that the digital asset might extend its upward movement. An analysis of TON’s current price action on the 1-day chart reveals that the bulls are still very active in the market as the price experiences a strong rejection after attempting a drop toward the bullish trend line. It can therefore be said that TON is actively bullish and may extend its bullishness. Adding to this, is the 1-day RSI indicator signaling more positive movements for TON’s price as the signal line after a drop to the 50% level, is beginning to rise above it again. Can TON Withstand The Crypto Winter? Exploring the prospects and strategies of TON for enduring future market downturns, it was revealed that if the crypto asset continues to move upward and break above the $7.7 resistance level. It may move higher to test the $8.2 resistance level and probably move on to create a new all-time high if the price breaches this level. However, if it fails to break above the $7.7 resistance level, it will begin to move downward toward the $6.7 support level. Should the price breach this support level, it may move further to test the $6.05 support level and possibly other lower levels.

42417890,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTbr8n,1719316981,"First Mover Americas: BTC Steadies, but 10% Monthly Loss Questions Nasdaq Rally","This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  The crypto market regained some poise early Tuesday as analysts said supply overhang concerns stemming from defunct exchange Mt. Gox's planned distribution of 140,000 BTC are overdone. Bitcoin traded above $61,000, having hit a low of $58,580 on Monday. The broader market gauge of the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) bounced to 2,083 points from 2,020. Still, BTC, a liquidity proxy for macro traders, is down almost 10% for the month, starkly contrasting with a 5% gain in Wall Street's tech-heavy index, Nasdaq. The differing trajectories might foreshadow a tightening of liquidity conditions in financial markets and be a bearish signal for Nasdaq. ""If Bitcoin serves as a liquidity gauge, then it would tell us that liquidity in the market is falling and that the Nasdaq 100 should eventually follow suit and move lower as well,"" Mott Capital Management founder Michael Kramersaid in his daily analysis. “It may not be such a good sign for Nvidia, either, because Nvidia has tracked Bitcoin fairly well, too.”  Traders on the decentralized predictions platform Polymarket have already chosen a winner in the 2024 U.S. Presidential Elections, and it's not incumbent Joe Biden. A Polymarket contract asking who would win the election showed Republican candidate Donald Trump as the clear favorite, with a 57% chance of winning versus 35% for Biden. Meanwhile, another contract showed Biden winning the popular vote, which merely represents the proportion of votes cast for each candidate and carries no electoral weight. Trump’s favorable stance on crypto means BTC and the wider market could emerge as a bet on Trump’s presidency in the lead up to the Nov. 4 election.  The impending U.S.-based spot ether ETFs could see less demand than their already live BTC peers, broker Bernstein said in a report Monday, echoing recent comments by investment banking giant JPMorgan. ""ETH should not see as much spot ETH conversion due to the lack of an ETH staking feature in the ETF,"" analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra wrote, adding that the basis trade will likely find takers over time and this should contribute to healthy liquidity in the ETF market. Spot ether ETFs are close to becoming available to investors in the U.S. after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved key regulatory filings from issuers last month. The excitement surrounding their debut has investors anticipating higher ether price swings than bitcoin. Some analysts believe it is unfounded.  Chart of the Day  The notional open interest in bitcoin futures listed across centralized exchanges has declined by 14% to $37 billion since June 7.  The decline represents the unwinding of carry/basis trades due to negative funding rates, according to analysts at Bitfinex.  Source: Coinglass  - Omkar Godbole  Trending Posts  Mt. Gox Effect?

Martin Shkreli continues to claim there was involvement.  So-called PoliFi tokens such as TRUMP, TREMP and Boden have recouped their losses after a slate of denials from people in Donald Trump's orbit – but not the campaign itself – regarding any official connection between the DJT token and the Republican presidential hopeful.  CoinGecko data shows that TRUMP, the first major token in the sector that matches financial instruments with political themes, has gained 24% in the past 24 hours, while its Solana counterpart TREMP added 20%, and the Joe Biden-themed BODEN is well in the green climbing over 45%.  The entire PoliFi sector has risen 14%, market data indicate.  The increases likely result from a market consensus that the DJT token does not have a connection to the former president's campaign nor to his family.  A Polymarket contract asking if DJT ""is real"" resolved to No, but that outcome is currently being disputed. Other contracts asking if Trump's son Barron Trump had some involvement also resolved to No, but they are going through that same dispute process.  Despite this, the DJT token added more than 30% in the last 24 hours.  An investigation by ZachXBT concluded that Martin “Pharma Bro” Shkreli, a convicted felon, was behind the token, which Shkreli confirmed – though he continues to claim that Barron Trump also participated in the project.

One analyst predicts that the crypto token could enjoy an unprecedented price rally. On the other hand, another analyst holds a bearish view and predicts that Cardano could experience a significant price crash. Cardano To Enjoy A 12,000% Rally In a post on Tradingview, crypto analyst Fiery Trading raised the possibility of Cardano rising to as high as $40 and even higher. The analyst highlighted a parallel channel and noted that Cardano could reach the top of this channel in the coming bull run, which would cause the crypto token to rise to $40. Related Reading: SkyBridge Capital’s Scaramucci Says Bitcoin Will Reach $250,000 Is This US Presidential Candidate Wins Fiery Trading admitted that Cardano rising to $40 is not a “likely outcome” but claimed that the risk-reward ratio is worth the risk. He added that Cardano’s current price is the “entry of a lifetime” and advised crypto investors not to miss out on it. In another post, Fiery Trading again hammered on Cardano’s current price level as an entry of a lifetime. He claimed that this entry is a “no-brainer” as long as Cardano keeps trading within that channel. Meanwhile, the crypto analyst highlighted more conservative price targets, pointing out $25 as another price level Cardano could reach, while he mentioned $3 as a target for “more defensive traders.” ADA Could Drop To As Low As $0.24 Crypto analyst Swallow Premium gave a bearish outlook for ADA. He noted that the crypto token has finally broken the liquidity zone at around $0.40 and now risks dropping to as low as $0.24. The crypto analyst predicted that Cardano could drop to that price level within a week or two. However, crypto analyst Sebastian suggested that Cardano might not drop below its current price range. He stated that the dump was over and that Cardano and the broader crypto market should enjoy a bounce from their current price level. He noted that the magnitude of the bounce will determine whether or not there may be more downside for ADA. The crypto analyst further stated that the next move the market should look forward to is seeing higher lows and higher highs. He claimed that the next target for Cardano is $0.40 and that the crypto token needs to rise above it and stay there. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Enters Accumulation Zone Amid 493% In Shibarium Transaction Fees Crypto analyst Trend Rider also noted that there are “quite a few bounce signals” on Cardano’s daily chart. He stated that Bitcoin needs to stop bleeding for ADA to recover. Bitcoin’s recent drop below $60,000 contributed to the significant declines that altcoins like Cardano experienced. At the time of writing, Cardano is trading at around $0.38, up almost 4% in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42417876,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTbquL,1719309976,Ether Spot ETFs Could See Lower Demand Compared to Bitcoin Peers: Bernstein,"Ether spot ETFs are expected to see less demand than bitcoin versions, the report said.  The lack of a staking feature in ether ETFs means less spot conversion, the report said.  Bernstein said that despite the recent pullback in crypto markets institutional adoption continues to grow.  Ether {{ETH}} spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), once approved for trading, will likely see the same sources of demand as the bitcoin {{BTC}} ETF but on a lower scale, broker Bernstein said in a research report on Monday.  “ETH should not see as much spot ETH conversion due to the lack of an ETH staking feature in the ETF,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra wrote, adding that the basis trade will likely find takers over time and this should contribute to healthy liquidity in the ETF market. The basis trade involves buying the spot ETF and selling the futures contract at the same time and then waiting for the prices to converge.  Spot ether ETFs are close to becoming available to investors in the U.S. after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved key regulatory filings from issuers last month.  “ETH as a primary tokenization platform is building up a strong use-case, both for stablecoin payments, as well as tokenization of traditional assets and funds,” the authors wrote.  Ether and other digital assets need a “more improved regulatory regime” and Bernstein expects the narrative to improve around the U.S. elections later in the year as the odds of a Republican victory continue to improve and because Trump is now pro-crypto.  ""Despite the recent pullback in crypto markets the “structural adoption cycle remains intact,” the report added.  Wall Street giant JPMorgan said that spot ether ETFs are likely to see much lower demand than the bitcoin ETFs, noting that the world’s largest cryptocurrency had the first mover advantage and could potentially saturate overall demand for crypto exchange-traded funds, it said in a report last month.

However, Dogecoin (DOGE), the memecoin often dismissed as a joke, has surprised some analysts with its relative stability during the downturn. Related Reading: Solana Slides 13% – Can It Recover Despite Analyst’s $1,000 Prediction? DOGE Holds On While Others Fall While established players like Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen significant price drops, Dogecoin has managed to maintain its support level. This unexpected resilience has sparked conversations about the future of DOGE, with some analysts cautiously optimistic. Analyst Predictions And Community Sentiment This cautious optimism is fueled by analyst predictions, with figures like Crypto Patel suggesting the current price correction presents a potential buying opportunity for DOGE.

Reminder: I never suggest… pic.twitter.com/bXT63iQb8V — Crypto Patel (@CryptoPatel) June 24, 2024 Patel has suggested an “accumulation zone” for DOGE between $0.07 and $0.10, hinting at a potential long-term price target that could be significantly higher. Based on his forecast, he believes that in the long run, DOGE might rise to $1 or perhaps $2. The passionate “Doge Army” has a history of driving up prices through social media campaigns and enthusiastic buying sprees. Renewed interest from the community, fueled by positive analyst outlooks like Patel’s, could lead to a surge in trading activity and potentially push the price upwards. The Challenge Of Sustainability The question of Dogecoin’s long-term sustainability remains. Memecoins are inherently volatile, and their value is often tied to hype and social media trends, not real-world utility. While a short-term pump is certainly possible, long-term success hinges on factors beyond community enthusiasm. Related Reading: Bitcoin Takes A Beating: Another $630 Million Exits, Price Drops Lower For Dogecoin to truly establish itself, it needs wider adoption and real-world use cases. While developers are working on improvements like the “Dogechain” scaling solution, progress has been slow.

Will it capitalize on its recent resilience and community support to carve out a niche in the ever-evolving cryptocurrency landscape?

Gox's repayments might be less severe than anticipated, potentially easing concerns about an immediate selloff.  Galaxy Research suggests that a significant portion of the distributed Bitcoin may not be immediately sold, as most will likely be held by creditors due to their low-cost basis.  Crypto traders say selling pressure from Mt. Gox’s newly announced repayments could be much less than market observers fear, easing concerns about an imminent selloff.  “The impact on bitcoin's price from Mt. Gox distributing Bitcoin is likely overblown,” Sam Callahan, senior analyst at Swan Bitcoin, said in a Tuesday email to CoinDesk. “Creditors who wanted to sell their bitcoin have now had more than 10 years to do so through selling their bankruptcy claims to more convicted, long-term investors.  “In addition, most creditors will likely hold their bitcoin because their cost basis is less than $700 per bitcoin,” he added.  Galaxy Research said in a Monday note that of the total 141,000 BTC earmarked for distribution, 65,000 BTC will be delivered to individual creditors, and another 30,000 BTC will be delivered to claims funds and a separate bankruptcy.  “It's reasonable to assume that most of the BTC received by funds that acquired claims from creditors will be distributed to LPs in kind and not sold off,” the firm said, alleviating concerns.

42417875,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTbqtJ,1719301575,Mt. Gox Effect? Bitcoin Dominance Drops Most in 5 Months,"BTC's dominance rate slid as Mt. Gox news weighs over BTC.  Short-duration options show renewed bias for puts or downside protection.  Some observers say Mt. Gox concerns may be overblown.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} is usually less volatile than alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), but Monday was different.  The leading cryptocurrency took a bigger hit than smaller tokens, leading to a marked slide in its market dominance in a compelling portrayal of the apprehensions about the impact of impending payouts to victims of a 2014 Mt. Gox hack.  BTC's dominance, or share of total crypto market value, fell by 1.8% to 54.34%, the biggest single-day percentage decline since Jan. 12, according to charting platform TradingView. In other words, investors likely pulled money from bitcoin faster than from its peers. The cryptocurrency's price fell nearly 5%, hitting lows under $59,000 at one point, CoinDesk data show.  The sell-off was not without cause. News that the defunct crypto exchange planned to distribute 140,000 BTC to the hack victims in July bolstered concerns the recipients would look to sell once they had their payouts, creating a supply overhang in the market. That added to pressures mounting since June 7 due to faster selling by miners and outflows from spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs).  Sell-off concerns boosted demand for short-term BTC put options on the Deribit exchange, according to data tracked by Amberdata. Put options offer protection against price slides in the underlying asset.  The seven-day and one-month call-put skews, which indicate what traders are willing to pay to acquire an asymmetric payout in the upward or downward direction over one week and one month, have flipped negative. That's a sign of renewed demand for puts.  Some observers, however, say the actual selling pressure from Mt. Gox reimbursements may be more measured.  ""The exact amount of Mt. Gox funds to be distributed in July are not specified, but it is part of a larger reimbursement plan that includes 142,000 Bitcoin and 143,000 Bitcoin Cash, as well as fiat currency totaling 69bn Japanese yen ($432mn),"" Tagus Capital said in a market note.  ""However, Mt. Gox creditors may hold their Bitcoin rather than sell, as they are long-term investors who resisted previous offers for USD payouts and may face capital gains tax on sales,"" Tagus Capital said in a market note,"" Tagus Capital added.",NEGATIVE,없음,BCH | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/06/25/mt-gox-effect-bitcoin-dominance-drops-most-in-5-months,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/07c4ef2efb1e99fa9ad9dd426ae054cf2bdc0312-2710x1442.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417889,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTbr7l,1719298800,ZKsync Developer's New 'Elastic Chain' Could Compete With Polygon's AggLayer,"Matter Labs, the main development firm behind the layer-2 network ZKsync, has introduced a new roadmap called ZKsync 3.0, aimed at making the ecosystem more interconnected – including a new ""Elastic Chain"" that somewhat resembles rival Polygon's AggLayer, released earlier this year.  At the core of ZKsync ""3.0"" is the v24 upgrade, released June 7, turning “ZKsync from a single ZK chain into an Elastic Chain,” the Matter Labs team wrote in a blog post shared with CoinDesk.  This Elastic Chain is composed of multiple chains in the ZKsync ecosystem, but users will feel like they are using a single chain, according to the team.  Last year, Matter Labs last year released their ZK Stack, which is a toolkit that allows developers to build their own blockchain on ZKsync’s technology. Essentially, these custom chains would all be interconnected through the Elastic Chain.  “The Elastic Chain is an infinitely extensible network of ZK chains (rollups, validiums and volitions), secured by math and seamlessly interoperable under uniform intuitive UX,” Matter Labs wrote.  The concept is part of a new trend in blockchain aimed at making interoperability within different ecosystems more seamless for users. Matter Labs’ competitor, Polygon, has a similar concept that they released in January, called the “AggLayer.”  The new Elastic Chain will be composed of three core components, according to Matter Labs.  The first component consists of the “Native Token Vault” and “Shared Router,” which is at the core of the network.  “Implemented as a series of smart contracts on Ethereum, these components are responsible for managing the state of the network, handling chain registrations,” the team wrote.  The second component is their ZK Gateway, which is a piece of middleware that connects the Ethereum blockchain to ZKsync’s ZK chains, that allows for interoperability between the different chains in the ZK sync ecosystem.  “Together, these core components ensure that ZK chains can interact and transact with each other efficiently, inheriting the security of Ethereum, and forming a network that can scale horizontally without compromising the core properties that make public blockchains so powerful,” Matter Labs wrote.

29927061,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626228,1719297005,Is The Bitcoin Bottom In? Here’s What 7 Experts Say,"The market saw a dramatic Bitcoin price drop over the past two days, plunging from a high of $64,500 on Sunday to a low of $58,474. Yesterday’s steep decline followed an unexpected announcement from the trustee of the defunct Mt. Gox exchange, revealing plans to commence BTC and BCH payouts in early July—a move that has sent shockwaves through the market. This news raises urgent questions about the immediate future of Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Amidst this market turmoil, several prominent cryptocurrency analysts have weighed in, offering their insights on whether Bitcoin could be nearing a local bottom. Here is a deeper dive into their analysis and perspectives: Bitcoin Technical Analysis Tony “The Bull” Severino, Chief Analyst at NewsBTC, provided a technical breakdown of the current situation. Utilizing the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements, Severino pointed out that the RSI levels are now as oversold as they were during the collapse of FTX, suggesting a potential cyclical bottom. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forms Bullish Signal That Led To At Least 60% Jump Last 3 Times “Bitcoin’s daily RSI is as oversold as during the FTX collapse, indicating a cyclical bottom might be forming,” said Severino. This analysis implies that, historically, such levels have often preceded a rebound or at least a stabilization in price. Volume And Market Behavior The Byzantine General, a trader and market strategist, noted the unusually high spot volume accompanying the price drop. “We’re seeing significantly high spot volume, which historically can signal a local bottom,” he remarked. High trading volumes during a price drop can indicate panic selling, which often exhausts itself leading to potential recovery. Social Media Sentiment Santiment, an analytics platform focusing on social metrics, observed a spike in discussions around the term “bottom” across various social media platforms. “This is one of the highest spikes in social volume and dominance for the word ‘bottom’ we’ve observed in the past year,” they reported. Historically, such spikes can signify heightened market attention that may correlate with pivotal market movements. Related Reading: SkyBridge Capital’s Scaramucci Says Bitcoin Will Reach $250,000 Is This US Presidential Candidate Wins Historical Patterns And Technical Indicators Teddy (@TeddyCleps), a cryptocurrency trader, emphasized the importance of historical patterns and specific technical indicators such as the 21-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA). “Historically, each correction in the BTC bull run has touched the 21-week EMA before rebounding. We’re approaching this indicator; if history is any guide, $61k could represent the bottom,” Teddy explained. The 21-week EMA is a key technical level watched by many traders for signs of long-term trend support. On-Chain Data Analysis James Check (@Checkmatey), an on-chain data analyst, shared his approach focused more on value acquisition rather than exact timing: “My strategy isn’t about pinpointing the absolute bottom but acquiring Bitcoin at significant discounts, as indicated by on-chain metrics like STH-SOPR and STH-MVRV both being below 1.” These metrics suggest that short-term holders are selling at a loss, which can be an opportunistic entry point for long-term investors. I prefer acquiring sats when both STH-SOPR and STH-MVRV are below 1. I’m not looking for bottoms, I’m looking for meaningful discounts. Love to see it.#Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/Jou9TSH3A9 — _Checkmate 🟠🔑⚡☢️🛢️ (@_Checkmatey_) June 25, 2024 Historical Post-Halving Performance Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) analyzed Bitcoin’s performance in post-halving periods, referring to the event where Bitcoin mining rewards are halved, theoretically increasing its scarcity. “BTC has not broken the high nor lost the low of its ReAccumulation Range in any post-halving period. This historical precedent suggests that Bitcoin should hold these levels,” he outlined. Market Psychology Cred (@CryptoCred), another respected trader, offered another angle and is not convinced the bottom is already in: “If this is the BTC bottom, I am likely to miss it. Often, a market that fails to break down at a level, only to return and close below it later, indicates a more legitimate breakdown. I’m not shorting but am also not buying.” At press time, BTC traded at $61,014.

After a euphoric climb that saw it breach the $73,000 level earlier this year, Bitcoin has shed its royal cloak, plummeting to new lows and dragging the entire crypto ecosystem into a period of frosty uncertainty. Related Reading: Solana Slides 13% – Can It Recover Despite Analyst’s $1,000 Prediction? Exodus From The Empire: Investors Pull Billions The past weeks have been marked by a mass exodus from Bitcoin. Investors, spooked by the prolonged price slump, have been fleeing the flagship cryptocurrency in droves. A recent report by CoinShares paints a bleak picture, revealing a staggering $630 million outflow from Bitcoin just last week. This follows a similarly hefty outflow of $631 million the week prior, marking a brutal two-week stretch for Bitcoin. The hemorrhaging extends beyond Bitcoin, with other prominent cryptocurrencies like Ethereum experiencing their own investor flight. The sell-off isn’t confined to individual holdings. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which allow traditional investors to dabble in crypto without directly owning it, have also been hit hard. Major issuers like Fidelity and Grayscale have witnessed a six-day consecutive outflow, with hundreds of millions of dollars vanishing from their coffers. This mass exodus from both Bitcoin and Bitcoin ETFs paints a clear picture: investors are losing faith, seeking shelter from the crypto storm. A Chink In The Armor? Not Quite While the overall sentiment is undeniably bearish, there are a few glimmers of hope amidst the gloom. Short positions, which essentially bet on a price decrease, have seen a surprising decline of $1.2 million. This could be interpreted as a decrease in bearish bets, hinting at a potential shift in investor sentiment. Additionally, some altcoins like Solana, Litecoin, and Polygon have defied the downward trend, registering healthy gains. This suggests that not all bets are off the table, and some investors might be seeking opportunities in other corners of the crypto market. A Crypto Winter Thaw Or Avalanche? The crypto market is no stranger to dramatic fluctuations. Bitcoin itself has a history of epic boom-and-bust cycles. However, the current downturn raises concerns about a prolonged “crypto winter” – a period of sustained decline. Related Reading: Toncoin On Fire: Crypto Explodes To All-Time High – Can It Hit $10? Meanwhile, the much-anticipated approval of an Ethereum ETF, initially viewed as a potential market catalyst, seems to be doing little to dispel the current chill. Will investors regain their appetite for digital assets, leading to a Bitcoin-fueled thaw? Or will the current outflow snowball into a full-blown avalanche, burying the crypto market under a blanket of red? The unfolding of this crypto winter remains to be seen.

Wikileaks and crypto have an intertwined history.  Julian Assange is free.  The Wikileaks co-founder, who spent five years in a U.K. jail cell and nearly seven years holed up in Ecuador's embassy in London, boarded a private jet at Stanstead airport and left the country, WikiLeaks announced on X.  Assange's departure from the U.K. follows prolonged negotiations with the U.S. Department of Justice, culminating in a deal that has not yet been formally finalized.  Assange was arrested in the U.K. for breaching his bail conditions after seeking asylum in Ecuador's London Embassy to avoid extradition on various charges, including those related to his role in publishing classified documents provided by Chelsea Manning.  Manning had her own sentence commuted in 2013 by then-President Obama.  Assange's first stop is Saipan, the capital of the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. protectorate, where he is expected to be sentenced to five years while getting credit for the five years of time served in the U.K.  Wikileaks and crypto  The history of Wikileaks and crypto has been closely intertwined.  In a 2014 interview, Assange said that bitcoin and Wikileaks helped keep each other alive.  As CoinDesk reported at the time, Assange said that Wikileaks initially refrained from accepting bitcoin to avoid drawing government scrutiny that could hinder the cryptocurrency's growth after a personal request from bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto. Later, when facing a financial blockade, it adopted bitcoin for donations, providing vital funding for Wikileaks and simultaneously enhancing BTC's legitimacy and utility.  In 2017, when rumors circulated that Assange was dead, he read off the latest bitcoin block hash as a proof-of-life.  During his legal battle with the U.S. and U.K governments, Assange and Wikileaks supporters turned to a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) to help fundraise for his legal fight, raising over 16,500 ether – over $55.2 million at current prices – for his defense.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/06/25/julian-assange-reaches-plea-deal-with-us-doj,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fc83ece0a4ad48505472fe28467434a2e628a245-1600x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a recent Bloomberg report, this decline can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the unlocking of tokens held by venture capitalists (VCs) and founders, as well as the selling pressure caused by the correlation between altcoins and major network tokens. Altcoin Market Hit By Token Unlock Wave As the crypto market recovered from the prolonged decline of two years ago, many projects’ tokens have reached their unlock dates this year. Per the report, venture capitalists and founders who received these tokens in exchange for investments or work contributions now have the opportunity to sell them. Out of the 138 tokens tracked by researcher TokenUnlocks, 120 have been scheduled for this year, with a combined market value of approximately $58 billion. This anticipated selling from unlocking VCs has led to downside price reflexivity as non-VC holders attempt to front-run the selling pressure, often resulting in steep discounts to spot prices. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crashes Below $61,000: The Main Reasons The price performance of altcoins such as DYDX, Avalanche (AVAX), and Pyth (PYTH) has been significantly impacted by token unlocks. DYDX’s token price has more than cut in half since mid-March, while AVAX and PYTH have also seen significant declines. These three tokens had unlocks scheduled for May, adding to the selling pressure. Token unlocks, which had previously helped drive 2023 prices, are now receiving more attention from VCs and public participants, prioritizing short-term profits over long-term holdings for altcoins with unlocks. Liquidity Crisis? Notably, since March 14, when Bitcoin (BTC) reached an all-time high of $73,700, only 12 out of the top 90 non-stablecoin assets tracked on centralized exchanges (CEXs) have posted positive returns, while 81 have recorded negative returns, according to the report. Bitcoin has dropped around 12% since its peak, and most of the top 100 tokens have declined by more than 25%. The smaller altcoins, including those correlated with major network tokens like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), tend to be sold off first when there is a decline. The unlocking of tokens exacerbates this selling pressure, further impacting the altcoin market. Related Reading: Toncoin On Fire: Crypto Explodes To All-Time High – Can It Hit $10? According to Bloomberg, the current market presents challenges for infrastructure projects funded during the bear market phase. While these projects launch their tokens, there is limited demand from “regular buyers” at high prices. The altcoin market is currently characterized by a lack of liquidity and a surplus of tokens being unlocked, leading to downward pressure on prices.

A close above the $0.500 resistance zone could send the price higher. The next key resistance is near $0.5250. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5500 resistance. Another Decline?

29920603,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626171,1719284437,Bitcoin Forms Bullish Signal That Led To At Least 60% Jump Last 3 Times,"An analyst has pointed out how an indicator is forming a signal for Bitcoin that has proven to be quite bullish for the asset during the past two years. Bitcoin Daily RSI Has Dipped Into The Oversold Territory In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed the latest trend forming in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for Bitcoin. The RSI is a popular technical analysis indicator that keeps track of the speed and magnitude of recent changes in BTC’s price. This metric represents its value on a scale from zero to a hundred. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Switching To Risk-Off Mode After $61,000 Crash When the indicator has a value lower than 30, the cryptocurrency is oversold right now. Such a trend may lead towards a bottom for the asset’s price. On the other hand, the metric above the 70 mark suggests the coin could be overbought currently and, hence, potentially due to a reversal towards the downside. Now, here is the chart shared by Ali that shows the trend in the daily RSI for Bitcoin over the last couple of years: As displayed in the above graph, the daily RSI has recently observed a plunge for Bitcoin, which now sits under the 30 level. Thus, it would appear that BTC is turning oversold, at least according to this metric. This development in the indicator has come as BTC has seen a crash in the past 24 hours that has taken its price below the $60,000 level for the first time since the start of May. The latest plummet into the underbought region is the first time the indicator has dipped into this region since August of last year. Interestingly, the signal eventually led to a 197% rally for cryptocurrency. Bitcoin also enjoyed a similar bullish effect during the other two occurrences of this trend from the past two years. The November 2022 signal resulted in a 60% surge, while the March 2023 one led to an increase of more than 62%. As the daily RSI has once again dropped into this territory for the asset, it’s possible that its price could end up seeing a return of bullish momentum in the coming future. The analyst notes that this could make the current dip a prime opportunity to buy. In the scenario that BTC does observe a rally arising out of this pattern similar to the previous instances, a run equal to the smallest surges (60%) would mean the cryptocurrency would rise to a new high of $96,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Slips Under $64,000: Here’s Where The Next Support Is Given this trend in the daily RSI, It remains to be seen how the price of the cryptocurrency develops from here.

Related Reading: Little-Known But Important Dogecoin Indicator Goes Off, How High Can It Drive Price? The SkyBridge Founder also revealed that he would be voting for Joe Biden and claimed that the good news for those who support Biden and crypto is that the “needle” has moved in a positive direction. Scaramucci tried to banish the belief that this current government is anti-crypto, noting that the Spot Ethereum ETFs have been approved, and there could be more layer-1 ETFs. Scaramucci further stated that although Biden vetoed the SAB 121 bill, he believes there will be a crypto bill in the ensuing congressional term that Biden will be willing to sign. Scaramucci is also bullish on Biden’s second term in relation to crypto because he believes that the “anti-crypto nonsense,” which he says is sponsored by Senator Elizabeth Warren and Gary Gensler, will be in the past by then. Interestingly, Scaramucci served as the White House Director of Communications under former US President Donald Trump, making his support for Biden surprising. Trump had also recently affirmed his support for cryptocurrencies, suggesting he was more open to Bitcoin and other crypto assets than Biden. However, despite all these, Scaramucci explained he isn’t supporting Trump because the former US President is “very transactional.” He noted how Trump had an anti-crypto stance while he was still President and has now made a complete turnaround, suggesting that Trump might just be supporting crypto because he wants to get votes from the crypto community. Why Crypto Has “Already Won” Scaramucci stated that the crypto industry has already won because it beat Warren and Gensler, who he claims are very Trump-like and “authoritarian and autocratic.” He also noted how the crypto industry has defeated the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in court on several occasions, with some of these cases causing the Commission to pay fines and be rebuked by Judges. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whale Withdraws 2.2 Billion SHIB From Robinhood, Should You Follow The Whales?

29916902,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626183,1719277213,Bitcoin Price Forecast: Three Strong Indicators Urge Buying As Experts Predict A 100% Rally Ahead,"The Bitcoin price has experienced a significant correction after failing to consolidate above the $70,000 level and retesting its all-time high of $73,700, which it reached in March. With a retracement of nearly 10% over the past week, BTC is now trading just above support at the $60,000 level. However, based on historical data, further price drops may be expected in the coming days, aligning with patterns observed before explosive bull runs. Bitcoin Price Analysis Crypto analyst Rekt Capital has compiled data showing the depth and length of retracements during previous market cycles. Historical patterns show retracements of approximately -23% (February 2023), -21% (April/May 2023), -22% (July/September 2023), -21% (January 2024), -23.6% (April/May 2024), and the current -16% retracement. Related Reading: Solana Developer Shares “Big News” That Could Send The SOL Price Flying Notably, the current retracement has not yet reached the average depth or length. Considering these statistics, Bitcoin could potentially retrace a further 6% to a trading price of $56,400. Additionally, the downtrend may continue for the next seven days until July 1st, possibly marking the final retrace below the sub $60,000 levels before a potential restart of the bull run and explosive price gains. However, the Bitcoin Crosby Ratio, a key indicator, is approaching the oversold territory. Throughout Bitcoin’s history, this has often signaled crucial reversal points for the cryptocurrency. Notably, the last time this occurred, Bitcoin rallied over 190% from approximately $25,000 to new all-time highs above $73,000. Furthermore, the Bitcoin daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) has entered the oversold zone for the fourth time since the $15,500 bottom reached in November 2022. In the past, such occurrences have frequently preceded rallies, resulting in gains of over 100%. Time To Buy The Dip? Renowned market expert Ali Martinez has identified a compelling correlation between Bitcoin’s market value to realized value (MVRV) Ratio and subsequent price jumps. The MVRV Ratio is a metric that compares the market capitalization of Bitcoin to the realized value of its coins. It provides insights into whether Bitcoin holders are at a profit or loss based on when they acquired their coins. Related Reading: Solana Slides 13% – Can It Recover Despite Analyst’s $1,000 Prediction? When the MVRV Ratio dips into negative territory, it suggests that many Bitcoin holders are in unrealized losses, potentially indicating an attractive buying opportunity. Analyzing the historical data, Martinez observed a consistent pattern where Bitcoin’s price experienced notable jumps following MVRV Ratio dips below -8.40%. On four occasions, these dips were followed by price surges of 63%, 100%, 92%, and 28%, respectively. These findings indicate that periods of negative MVRV Ratios can indicate strong market support and a subsequent bullish trend.

Over the past month, AVAX has plummeted by 25%, with a 14.7% drop in just the past week and a further 0.3% decrease in the last 24 hours, bringing its current trading price to $24.23. This decline marks a stark turnaround for an asset that has otherwise shown strong performance in previous months.

Crypto analyst Patel, referencing the current chart patterns, speculates that AVAX could soon face an additional 40% to 60% drop in its value. The formation of a head-and-shoulder pattern, a classic technical indicator of future price decreases, drives this bearish outlook. Patel pointed out the critical nature of the head-and-shoulder pattern forming on the AVAX chart, noting that the neckline support has already been breached.

He emphasizes the importance of implementing strict stop-loss measures to manage risks associated with the anticipated volatility. External Influences And Optimistic Counterpoints Further compounding AVAX’s market woes is the activity of significant holders moving large volumes of AVAX to major exchanges. Prominent on-chain investigator ZachXBT has recently linked the ongoing decline in AVAX’s value to significant transactions by a specific entity identified as ‘0x32…4f30.’ This entity has reportedly transferred approximately 1.96 million AVAX, valued at $54.2 million, to major exchanges, including Coinbase, Binance, and Gate, and has also facilitated transfers via THORChain. This type of large-scale movement typically indicates a bearish sentiment among major holders, potentially leading to further declines if the trend continues. Despite the prevailing downturn in AVAX’s performance, some analysts remain optimistic about the broader altcoin market. Analyst Captain Faibik suggests the current correction period could be a prime investment opportunity for long-term investors. According to Faibik, the altcoin sector has shown resilience and growth over the past several months and is merely undergoing necessary corrections after significant gains.
