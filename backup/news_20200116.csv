42383192,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uVKF,1579214485,CabbageTech CEO Sentenced to 33 Months in Prison After Pleading Guilty in Fraud Case,"Patrick McDonnell was sentenced to 33 months in federal prison Thursday after pleading guilty to charges of defrauding investors in his crypto trading firm CabbageTech, otherwise known as Coin Drop Markets.      McDonnell was also ordered to pay back his victims $224,352, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York. Thursday’s sentencing caps McDonnell’s back-to-back legal fights with the federal government, which saw the 47-year-old New York resident in civil and then criminal court on fraud charges. He pleaded guilty in June 2019, a press release stated.      Both cases stemmed from his tenure as CabbageTech CEO, where he defrauded victims of over $200,000, according to prosecutors.      Thursday's release claimed he stole bitcoin, litecoin, ethereum and verge from 10 victims under the alter-ego “Jason Flack.” New victims were solicited on social media. While McDonnell promised investors would profit, he instead provided false financial statements, prosecutors sai.      The CabbageTech platform started in May 2016, according to prosecutors. By 2018 the government was taking notice.      That January, the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed a civil suit against McDonnell, accusing him of defrauding investors. It based its right to enforce on a 2014 Internal Revenue Service ruling that bitcoin and other “convertible virtual currencies” are commodities.      This definition had never been tested in court before but a judge soon ruled in the CFTC’s favor, creating a precedent for the IRS rule and bolstering the regulator’s subsequent enforcement actions across the space. McDonnell was eventually ordered to pay $1.1 million.      The Justice Department followed with criminal action. It was assisted by the CFTC’s previous work and secured a guilty plea from McDonnell in June 2019, according to a press release.      “This office will continue to vigorously prosecute white-collar criminals who defraud the investing public,” Richard P. Donoghue, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said in a statement Thursday.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | SPONSORED | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/16/cabbagetech-ceo-sentenced-to-33-months-in-prison-after-pleading-guilty-in-fraud-case,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd816239f98222adb233d0ec61187dde47c608a3-1500x729.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383210,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uVi9,1579212001,Currency 'Cold War' Takes Center Stage at Pre-Davos Crypto Confab,"ST. MORITZ — The United States may be entering a second Cold War, according to some investors, who seem mildly curious but otherwise unconcerned about the prospect.      “It’s a kind of Cold War, but not just for crypto,” said Multicoin Capital’s Beijing-based partner Mable Jiang. “Currency is the leverage.”      Jiang said China’s goal is to leverage the rise of cryptocurrency, including both domestic bitcoin mining and a state-issued digital currency, to supplant the dollar and become the world’s leading economic power. Such rivalries feel lightyears away in the frosted Swiss alps, which are teeming with high-net-worth individuals soaking up the last few days of politician-free ski slopes before the World Economic Forum in Davos.      Roughly 250 people gathered at the Crypto Finance Conference St. Moritz this week, hosted in a luxurious mountain getaway at 6,000 feet, for a series of talks that largely revolve around embracing strict compliance standards. (Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss took a break from skiing to argue that thorough regulatory standards could help the U.S. retain its leading role in the global financial system.)      For crypto conference regulars who recall the post-2017 token boom correction, this gathering might feel like falling into a time machine, complete with security token sales and closed-loop stablecoins. Meanwhile, the World Economic Forum (WEF) worked with 38 central banks around the world in 2019 to develop digital payment or asset strategies, according to Sheila Warren, the WEF’s head of blockchain and distributed ledger technology. From Cambodia to Colombia, many emerging nations plan to launch operational stablecoin projects, beyond pilots, in 2020.      “There’s this sense that they [emerging economies] could actually benefit from pegging a stablecoin to a basket of currencies in a way that they can’t currently do if they issue paper money,” Warren said.      Today, most global commerce relies on dollars in some fashion. Warren said there’s “certainly an interest” among emerging economies in developing systems that don’t pass through New York clearinghouses. That’s where Jiang said the Chinese plans for a digital RMB currency come in.      “It’s not actually for people who live in China. They have WeChat or AliPay,” she said. “It’s another global settlement currency, including for developing countries around the world, which they [the Chinese] are friends with.”      Warren said the U.S. would likely resist systems that circumnavigate the dollar, adding Chinese government officials are actively participating in talks related to the WEF’s blockchain initiative. ConsenSys, the Ethereum Foundation and the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance are among the companies consulting leaders in those emerging economies, she said.      However, Warren added, the WEF doesn’t make those introductions nor recommend any country issue a digital currency. It merely offers guidelines and support to decision makers in emerging economies. Carmen Benitez, CEO of the Switzerland-based startup Fetch Blockchain LTD, heads yet another firm consulting countries eager to issue a cryptocurrency.      “They approached us,” Benitez said of her clients in the Colombian president’s office, which is setting up a bank-managed stablecoin for government projects in 2020. “They want a coin … they like the idea of keeping [the economic flow] as closed as possible with the coin.”    BankerCoin    Cypherpunks might argue a state- or bank-issued currency with strict limitations imposed by the issuer bears little resemblance to “cryptocurrency.” But that doesn’t deter the blockchain fans gathered at St. Moritz.      Benitez said using a blockchain-based currency would provide better transparency and automation than Colombia’s current, paperwork-heavy system. Likewise, most attendees appeared more excited about fitting tokens into a traditional banking framework than they were about innovations like the Lightning Network, for example.      “Stablecoins and central bank digital currencies will be [widespread] in just a few years,” said Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist of Hamburg Commercial Bank. “Even if Libra doesn’t come true, there will be another privately issued stablecoin backed by fiat currencies.”      To many of these attendees, bitcoin offers a welcome diversification of investment options. Indeed, Grayscale director Michael Sonnenshein said the firm garnered more assets in 2019 than all previous years combined, leading to a total of $2.4 billion worth of crypto under management. Bitcoin products are still the most popular, although altcoin dips don’t deter investors.      “We saw stronger inflows into our ethereum product last year,” Sonnenshein said. “Investors are looking at more than just bitcoin.”      Generally speaking, self-custody isn’t a priority for such institutional, European clients. This bothers Pascal Gauthier, CEO of hardware wallet company Ledger, who said there’s scant focus on secure custody as Europe is regulating bitcoin-related activities “very heavily, very quickly.”      European regulations like AMLD5 require all companies involved with money transmission, potentially including lightning liquidity providers, decentralized finance (DeFi) products like Compound and custodial wallets, behave more like banks in 2020 by collecting know-your-customer (KYC) information. This even applies to small startups working with microtransactions. Plus, the Financial Action Task Force established new rules that may force exchanges to collect more information related to addresses that users send crypto to in 2020.      Although no one knows for sure how these rules will play out, as they appear difficult to enforce, veteran bitcoiner Joseph Weinberg, co-founder of the Shyft Network, said he worries this approach may be regulating away censorship-resistance.      “Lightning applications may be accepting micropayments but acting as hubs, so if you think about being a payment channel provider, you’re effectively involved as an intermediary,” he said. “At the end of the day, this is all about sanctions.”      WEF’s Warren agreed dominant economic players, like the U.S., are now tightening the reins on activities with the potential to circumnavigate sanctions.    Digital Dollar    Some digital fiat advocates believe blockchain technology could even make sanctions more effective.      Former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo, who recently became co-founder of the Digital Dollar Foundation to advocate for a central bank digital currency (CBDC) from the U.S., said the term Cold War was a wee bit “strong” for disparity between the U.S. and China. Yet he generally agreed the economic rivalry was reminiscent of “the race to land on the moon.”      “Many other global powers are looking to assert their own currency as an important reserve currency,” Giancarlo said. “A digital dollar allows for a more scalpel-like approach to sanctions.”      On the other hand, de la Rubia said it would take a long time for any digital currency to rival the U.S. dollar’s global dominance. He argued that the European Union (EU) would love for Saudi Arabia to price oil contracts in Euros, yet the EU has been unable to contradict the dollar’s supreme liquidity.      “Bitcoin will always be volatile, with supply well-defined and demand moving,” he said. “As long as China has international capital controls, it will be hard for the yuan to take over, even as a digital currency.”      When asked about bitcoin, Giancarlo preferred to compare Facebook’s Libra project to his own Digital Dollar aspirations and the yuan.      “Only one of those three [currency issuers] would be constitutionally prohibited from mining that data for any purpose other than illicit use,” he said. “A digital Yuan will absolutely be monitored by the government for many purposes … a commercial venture absolutely will mine that data to say whether you are shopping at Nordstrom or at Target.”      Giancarlo said he wants to dedicate the rest of his career to modernizing America’s financial infrastructure, and he sees a blockchain-based fiat currency as a part of that.      He would not say what role bitcoin might play in that future. Instead, he said there’s an increasing interest in exploring “legitimate and positive use cases.”      Currency is, after all, a tool for political leverage. And although “blockchain” is on the tips of everyone’s tongue this time of year in Switzerland, few people at St. Moritz acknowledge the role a decentralized cryptocurrency might play beyond an investing hedge.      Those who are bullish on bitcoin, not just blockchain, are left wondering how bitcoin can be a geopolitical hedge if most conduits for moving money around the ecosystem are essentially banks.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/16/currency-cold-war-takes-center-stage-at-pre-davos-crypto-confab,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6ae7f79f078c27fd7be8e8ada7dece106e7273be-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383200,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uVUJ,1579209315,US Lawmakers Try Again on Tax Relief for Small Crypto Payments,"U.S. lawmakers have resurrected a bipartisan push to exempt gains from small cryptocurrency transactions from being taxed.      On Thursday, Reps. Suzan DelBene (D-Wash.), David Schweikert (R-Ariz.), Darren Soto (D-Fla.) and Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) introduced “The Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act of 2020,” an amendment to IRS tax code that would exempt realized gains under $200, otherwise known as a de minimis threshold.      From a practical standpoint the bill could simplify the tax burdens of day-to-day crypto users who must report even marginal capital gains under current federal law. This is based on a 2014 Internal Revenue Service guidance that treats bitcoin and other “convertible virtual currencies” as taxable commodities.      This legislation does not alter that bureaucratic determination, but it would provide relief for low-level use cases, like transactions, while enforcing it against more substantial users, like investors.      Neeraj Agrawal, director of communications for Coin Center, which lobbied the representatives on this bill, said it takes some pressure off everyday users.      ""Extending this sensible exemption to cryptocurrency would allow users to do simple things like send small transactions to each other or fractions of pennies to dapps without having to deal with a fairly complicated capital gains calculation every time,” he said.      The bill would retroactively apply to all qualifying transactions from Dec. 31, 2019.      Representatives have tried to push through similar legislation before. In 2017, Schweikert co-sponsored more ambitious legislation that would have placed the bar at $600.

Ex-CFTC Chair Chris Giancarlo – aka “Crypto Dad” – isn’t waiting around. He has teamed with Accenture to launch a new non-profit, the Digital Dollar Foundation.      As crypto continues to evolve, it does so in sometimes divergent directions. Gemini announced a new insurance company designed to make big institutions more comfortable with the space. Zcash, meanwhile, released an updated SDK to make it easier to shield transactions via mobile. Can the privacy-preserving side of crypto co-exist, ultimately, with the sanguine institutional side?

42383206,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uVbr,1579205373,Fake News on Steroids: Deepfakes Are Coming – Are World Leaders Prepared?,"This is part of a series of op-eds previewing the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. CoinDesk will be on the ground in Davos from Jan. 20–24 chronicling all things crypto at the annual gathering of the world’s economic and political elite. Follow along by subscribing to our pop-up newsletter, CoinDesk Confidential: Davos.      Arif Khan is the CEO of Alethea AI. The opinions here are his own.      Despite its shortcomings, the World Economic Forum has laudably established itself as an important venue for highlighting controversial technology trends that will have broad impacts on our world.      What 2018 and 2019 were to blockchain and cryptocurrencies on the WEF stage (met with a healthy mix of intrigue and skepticism), 2020 will be to synthetic media, also known by the ominous-sounding euphemism “deepfakes.”      While this concept may seem like sheer science-fiction to most, the WEF has added an entire session to its 2020 program devoted to deepfakes and the risks they pose to societies and political systems. These technologies will also be on full display at several of the side events populating the Davos Promenade.      For a quick primer on why deepfakes are no joking matter, see this video in which Jet Li’s face has been replaced by Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao.      While CZ was good-natured enough to retweet the light-hearted parody, he sounded a cautionary note that KYC and video recognition would be challenging to implement if this trend continues.      We’re not in Kansas anymore...    Open-source artificial intelligence algorithms are now enabling the creation of deepfakes at a staggering rate, meaning the “fake news” controversies witnessed during the 2016 U.S. presidential election will seem like child’s play in 2020. There are two categories of deepfakes: malicious and non-malicious, better known as synthetic media.      Given that most businesses are grossly under-equipped to protect themselves against basic scams like phishing emails, it’s difficult to even to fathom the impacts that deepfake media could have if deployed maliciously against a naive population.      So why does this matter to crypto? After all, we’re a savvy community at the bleeding edge of technology, right? True, but scams still proliferate in the crypto industry – just look at all the “Not giving away ETH” warnings attached to impersonated Crypto Twitter celebs.      With synthetic media, scammers now have a new arsenal to impact the trajectory of a decentralized organization and create unprecedented chaos. We will almost assuredly see deepfakes of crypto-industry titans in 2020. How we respond to this emergent media landscape depends on how well inoculated our societies and communities will be.    Synthetic media will emerge as an asset class in 2020    But there’s no need to run for the hills. Like any technology, the underlying algorithms that develop deepfakes can be put to benevolent uses unlocking economic value and productivity gains, while enabling new modes of artistic expression. While commercial use cases are still in their infancy, 2020 will see concerted attempts at making this technology accessible to the masses in positive ways.      For example, the now famous Peloton Girl’s face was instantly recognizable in the Gin advertisement developed and shot by the prescient Ryan Reynolds. Her likeness and face were “liquid” in the sense that they were superimposable to a diametrically opposite narrative context within a short span of time. In the future, we will witness similar examples, and if her “likeness” is digitally replicable, she’ll have the option of participating in a multitude of differing contexts within a short span of time, enhancing her virality and influence further. This will unlock significant commercial value for actors, talent agencies and their brands.      Synthetic digital copies that are lifelike, emotive and expressive will be instantly swappable and tradeable like game skins and voice skins in online role-playing games. Actors and their talent agencies will be clamoring for the whitespace that synthetically created digital storytelling will enable. Our faces and voices will be rented, modified, reskinned and repurposed.      Other benevolent use-cases could mean preserving a relative’s voice for future generations to hear and learn from or even preserving the likeness of a savant mathematician or musical genius, to serve as a constant source of inspiration for a society or community. Imagine Gandhi teaching you the principles of non-violence or a recently deceased relative reading a children’s audiobook to your yet-to-be-born children. The benevolent applications are endless. Yet, the digital rights infrastructure is nascent.    Should we encourage the financialization of our faces and voices?    But, as is the case with other novel technologies, it doesn’t require much imagination to envision how this could quickly turn dystopian. To fight against such a scenario, we must empower individuals to have access to the data that underpin their likeness, faces and voices. No government or corporation should own any human’s identity. Individuals must be empowered to preserve, transact and liquidate their likeness within the correct and evolving legal and intellectual-property landscape. For this to happen, synthetic media will need a new digital rights substrate to manage permissions, transactions and governance.      Rumors have set the creative and tech industries abuzz that both TikTok and Snapchat are developing face-swapping capabilities for the masses. While these centralized data companies will aim for as much value capture in terms of engagement and time spent on their apps, it is critical a decentralized alternative and ethos emerges to enable individuals to have agency over their likeness and their data.      As faces and voices become fully synthetic in 2020, we risk harming our social and economic fabric if individuals are not able to understand the value of their voices and faces. This will be especially so if all of the value capture occurs at the application layer of centralized companies, as has all too often been the case in the Web 2.0 context.    Will the internet be reduced to a hall of mirrors?    Even prior to deepfakes, the modern world was experiencing truth decay.      The trust that our society places on the digital information we come across is falling. The constant barrage of false information has left us exhausted and, at times, apathetic. The democratization of AI tools to generate synthetic content will make the current standards of misinformation seem almost benign. With the rise of synthetic media and at-will deepfake creation tools, how will we learn to discern the truth?      Some blockchain-based timestamping solutions offer interesting pathways to enabling a digital registry of all synthetic content, yet the possibilities for centralized control of the registries remain. Other solutions explored enable fingerprinting of digital content and hashing at the point of capture, both relevant but unfortunately narrow use cases that do not fully address the complexity of the problem.      Just like bitcoin and ethereum inadvertently led to individuals learning more about markets, game theory, money production and economics, we would need decentralized alternatives and incentives to allow people to truly understand the value of their digital likeness. Upcoming discussions at the WEF and elsewhere will, hopefully, establish a baseline grasp of the issues at play and a framework and an understanding for what solutions are required.  In particular, the role blockchain technology can play in creating an underlying substrate must be highlighted. Yes, we all remember 2018 when blockchain was the solution to every problem on Planet Earth and then some, but it will have to play a role here both in regard to timestamping deepfakes and facilitating the creation of a digital rights management layer – which would thus empower individuals to eventually transact with their face or voice data.      As the stakes continue to get higher and as content becomes increasingly liquid, emergent and viral, we will need to have a solid grasp on our reality and the shared truths that undergird it. If we thought fake news damaged the trust in our society, deepfakes, if improperly managed, will do far worse.      However, we cannot throw the baby out with the bathwater. The synthetic media phenomenon is here to stay; what is required is a solid understanding of how it can be used to benefit individuals and society, as well as a strategy for mitigating the damages potentially caused by malicious actors.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | BNB,Arif Khan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/01/16/fake-news-on-steroids-deepfakes-are-coming-are-world-leaders-prepared,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0617f5c0a8d957f80744e7316d9de773cbbde4d3-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

On Jan. 8, the New Hampshire House of Representatives accepted a motion from the General Court's Executive Departments and Administration Committee stating that the tax bill was ""inexpedient to legislate"" and should be removed before it reaches the floor. The committee voted to kill the bill in November on a 17-1 vote, as originally reported by The Block.      The bill would have required the state treasurer to develop a means for New Hampshire citizens to pay any taxes or fees due to the state in digital currencies beginning July 1, 2020. They would also have had to find ""an appropriate third-party payment processor that will process cryptocurrency transactions at no cost to the state.”      Proposed by Representatives Dennis Acton and Michael Yakubovich, both Republicans, on Jan. 3, 2019, the language of House Bill 470 was brief, comprising just two clauses. The bill did not specify if taxes were to be paid fully in cryptocurrencies and if only some digital currencies, such as bitcoin or ethereum, would be accepted.      The bill had a promising start, passing unanimously through a subcommittee of the House Executive Departments and Administration Committee in February 2019. It passed with an amendment to ensure the state could still collect taxes in the event a transaction failed or was sent to the wrong address.      However, cryptocurrencies have the added danger of being volatile assets, a fiscal note appended to the document states, meaning the value of revenue collected could fluctuate. ""The volatility of accepting cryptocurrencies could affect revenues due to tax assessments being generated in U.S. currency,"" it reads.      This is the second time New Hampshire lawmakers have stopped a crypto tax bill. One proposed in 2015 that directed the state to partner with a bitcoin startup to allow citizens to pay their taxes in cryptocurrency was also killed off in the committee phase. A similar effort in Arizona in 2018 was stripped down to such a degree that the final version did not mention the technology at all; the bill was eventually scrapped due to insufficient votes.      Taxes in New Hampshire can only be paid in U.S. dollars, while payments made in foreign currencies are usually returned. The only state that accepted cryptocurrency for tax was Ohio, which passed that into law in late 2018.

42431416,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2LFh,1579188424,Bitcoin’s Share of PoW Mining Rewards Now Above 80%,"Rewards received by bitcoin miners form a major chunk of the salaries paid across major proof of work (PoW) blockchains, according to Yassine Elmandjra, a cryptocurrency analyst from ARK Invest.      For example, bitcoin miners were paid over $15 million worth of the cryptocurrency as incentive to mine blocks and secure the network on Jan. 9. Meanwhile, the total rewards paid across bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH) and other major PoW cryptocurrencies including zcash (ZEC), litecoin (LTC), ethereum classic (ETC), bitcoin cash (BCH) and bitcoin SV (BSV) were just a bit more than $18 million.      Essentially, bitcoin miners were responsible for nearly 83 percent of the total mining rewards paid across major PoW blockchains.      Since mid-2017, bitcoin miners' salary share has increased by 250 percent, while that of ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, has dropped significantly.      Proof-of-work is a consensus algorithm for blockchain networks where miners find blocks by solving cryptographically hard puzzles. This is in contrast to the proof-of-stake (PoS), where validators lock up the respective cryptocurrency to claim their stake in the ecosystem.      Strongest coin    The fact that bitcoin miners are drawing significantly higher salaries than their counterparts is not surprising, given bitcoin is the strongest PoW-powered coin with the largest network effect and the longest track record, according to Muneeb Ali, CEO of Blockstack PBC.      A network effect is the idea that as adoption and integration into a system grows, so does its value – and at an exponential rate rather than at a linear rate.      Back in 2016, bitcoin expert Trace Mayer mentioned the store of value appeal, security and speculation that bitcoin’s network effect would grow rapidly.      “The cryptocurrency has almost totally captured the store of value narrative, allowing for consolidation around the strongest coin,” Blockstack’s Ali said.      Further, bitcoin's network security, as represented by its hash rate, has increased sharply over the years, helping build confidence in the blockchain and establishing a positive feedback loop of security and network effect. At press time, bitcoin's hash rate is roughly 100,000,000 Terahashes (or 100 exahashes).    Looking forward    Bitcoin’s share of PoW mining could grow even larger in the future as ethereum and other blockchains begin shifting to proof-of-stake, which is less energy-intensive consensus mechanism, said Ali.      Ethereum is expected to complete the transition from PoW to PoS by 2022. “Its network will be better once ETH 2.0 (post-transition) shows its true value in the global market,” Steve Tsou, Global CEO of RRMine, told CoinDesk.      Another factor that could affect miner’s income and influence bitcoin’s share of PoW mining is the reward halving due in four months. The rewards received for per block mined on bitcoin’s blockchain will be reduced from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC sometime in May. Mining costs will double post halving and that could crowd out weak miners, causing changes between supply and demand.      RRMine’s Tsou said miners' income will rise if halving creates a supply deficit, pushing prices above mining costs. That could also boost bitcoin’s share of PoW mining – more so, as increased profitability may attract miners from other chains.      “The most important thing is that the miners control the cost, which completely determines if the miners can profit from it,” Tsou said.      However, if prices drop sharply, controlling cost will be a challenge and miners may exit, possibly leading to a drop in bitcoin’s share of PoW mining.",POSITIVE,BCH | ETC,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | ETC | MARKET | MINING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/16/bitcoins-share-of-pow-mining-rewards-now-above-80,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1e67a3c516cd5f8e81e481d641424139a25cb962-943x663.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431412,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2LHh,1579187985,Chrysler Building Owner Sells Stake in Zurich Property for ERC-20 Tokens and Cash,"The new owner of the Chrysler Building is selling a property worth $135 million to a blockchain real-estate company, taking a fifth of the purchase price in tokenized securities.      New York-based RFR Holdings, which purchased the Chrysler Building in a joint agreement in March 2019, agreed to sell its majority stake in a commercial property in Zurich to BrickMark, a real estate agency with offices in Switzerland and Germany.      Announced Wednesday, BrickMark said roughly 20 percent of the purchase price will be paid in the firm's BMT security token.      The deal gives BrickMark 80 percent of the building, with the option to purchase RFR's remaining share until September. The purchase price has not been disclosed, but the value of the token share is believed to be in the tens of millions of euros.      According to BrickMark CEO Stephan Rind, it is the largest-ever real estate deal involving digital tokens. ""There has never been a token-based real estate transaction of this magnitude. We are implementing what was once no more than a concept in the real estate industry,"" he said.      The property is situated on the downtown street of Bahnhofstrasse (pictured), where rent per square meter is commonly between $13,000 to $15,000 a year, making it one of the most expensive shopping districts in the world. In 2014, Swatch Group purchased a nearby property for a reported $409 million.      One of the largest real estate purchases to involve cryptocurrency was the sale of a mansion just outside of San Francisco to a Chinse millionaire for 500 bitcoin, approximately $4 million at the April 2018 exchange rate.      BrickMark's ethereum-based tokens are hybrid digital securities – tokenized perpetual bonds that will be backed by property in the BrickMark portfolio (for now, just this one building). BMT's price represents the property's net asset value performance and tokens will confer voting rights to holders.      Under the deal, RFR will lead redevelopment plans to expand the Zurich property's rentable space sixfold, increasing annual revenue and, therefore, the value of the token.    Expansion ahead    With the Bahnhofstrasse deal completed, BrickMark plans to expand its portfolio. The firm plans to finalize a financing round worth €50 million ($55.7 million) and begin acquiring other high-value commercial properties in Europe and North America. More tokens will be issued in line with new real estate acquisitions, enabling more investors to participate without diluting those held by existing holders.      Currently, there are only a handful of entities holding BMT tokens. Although restricted for the time being to qualified investors, there are plans under evaluation that would allow BrickMark to offer BMT tokens to retail investors through a European-regulated security token offering (STO).      According to its website, BrickMark has a €1 billion ($1.1 billion) worth of property assets. Issuing digital securities makes the investable real estate market, worth approximately $80 trillion, more accessible to institutions, the company believes.      ""Only 3 percent [of investable real estate] is available for investors through public listed real estate companies or real estate-backed bonds or funds structures,"" Rind said in a call Wednesday, highlighting that only a 5-percent fraction is ever traded on an annual basis. ""We think digital securities and tokens are able to unlock these tremendous values and also give people, on a worldwide basis, access to properties that have [to now] been privileged.""      “Unlocking the value of the remaining USD 76 trillion is probably the biggest addressable market opportunity in the world,"" Rind told CoinDesk.    Nascent industry    Other entities have also recognized the disruptive potential for blockchain in real estate. The tZERO security token platform and the Tezos Foundation signed an agreement to tokenize $643 million of U.K. real estate back in October 2019. Another real estate startup, known as AssetBlock, launched a commercial property trading platform on the Algorand blockchain in September.      That said, previous initiatives have failed to meet the high expectation. One high-profile venture between technology startup Fluidity and broker-dealer Propellr was quietly shelved last summer because ""it didn't have sufficient institutional appetite.""      Discussing the Bahnhofstrasse deal, Dr. Alexander Koblischek, managing director of RFR Germany, said: ""We gladly accepted the Brickmark tokens as part of the purchase price. We assume that digital financial instruments will also significantly gain in importance in the real estate sector in the future.""      ""The current transaction may have an icebreaker function for the sector in terms of its volume and institutional character,"" Koblischek said.      EDIT (Jan. 16, 16:01 UTC): A previous version of this article said the BMT token did not confer voting rights and BrickMark managed a property portfolio worth $15 billion.

42431415,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2LJh,1579183200,Coinbase-Led Crypto Ratings Council Plans Transparency Boost as New Members Join,"The Crypto Ratings Council (CRC), the Coinbase-led organization hoping to create a standard for assessing whether different cryptocurrencies are securities under U.S. law, is adding new members.      The group announced Thursday that eToro, Radar and OKCoin US have joined the aspiring industry group looking to streamline how exchanges assess whether a cryptocurrency is a security. The new members bolster the level of technical and legal information that the group can utilize, said Juan Suarez, a VP and general counsel at Coinbase working with the CRC.      Suarez told CoinDesk in a phone call that every CRC member reviews the ratings before they are made public, and each asset is listed by at least one of the group.      The CRC rates assets on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 denoting cryptocurrencies that do not appear to have the characteristics of a security under U.S. law. Five new assets were rated Thursday: cosmos (ATOM) and livepeer (LPT) have both received a 3.75 score, while dash (DASH) and horizen (ZEN) received 1s and ethereum classic (ETC) received a 2.      In addition, the CRC will refine the explanations on its current list, Suarez said. The ratings themselves won't change but the reasoning behind whether each asset resembles a security will be condensed.      “It just is a part of routine operations of the company that we’ll be changing,” he said. “We’re refining the bullet points to make them more factual and explicit.”      While its ratings indicate the CRC’s confidence that a particular asset resembles – or doesn’t resemble – a security, the group is not affiliated with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which to date has only stated that bitcoin and ethereum are not securities.      As a press release puts it: “The CRC’s analysis is its own and is not endorsed by developer teams, regulators or any other third party.”    Public reveal    As part of its 2020 roadmap, the CRC plans to share details of the actual framework it uses to arrive at its evaluations. Suarez said the group plans to continue providing its analysis for any given asset, but releasing the broader framework may help the industry.      The current lack of transparency around how assets are evaluated was one major criticism of the CRC when the group was first unveiled. Industry lawyers told CoinDesk the initiative seemed a beneficial one overall for the space, but revealing the framework in particular would help non-member companies.      “We’re going to release the framework in the hopes that it creates a useful discussion for the industry and we’re going to recruit more members,” Suarez said.      There's also work afoot to address questions raised by current CRC members about the framework. Once those are finalized, the analytical framework will be released.      As part of this effort, several meetings are planned in the coming weeks, according to Suarez.      “We just want to make sure we release the best and final work product possible,” he said. The plan is to make sure it’s ""scalable and easy to use"" by legal teams at exchanges.      By releasing the framework, the CRC may be able to create guidelines and best practices for companies and developers to look at. The end goal, according to Suarez, is to help crypto startups more easily comply with existing securities law.      “That’s kind of the North Star that we’re driving to,” he said.",POSITIVE,ETC,ETC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/16/coinbase-led-crypto-ratings-council-plans-transparency-boost-as-new-members-join,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7bfa1d8eaf1b2a23bc6b2e9c888783aba64b088f-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42431413,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2LLh,1579183080,Former CFTC Officials Ramp Up Push for Digital Dollar With Accenture Partnership,"Former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo, former LabCFTC Director Daniel Gorfine and investor Charles Giancarlo want to take the dollar digital – and they're not waiting for the Federal Reserve.      The three are forming the Digital Dollar Foundation, working with Accenture to design and push for a potential U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC).      The new not-for-profit organization has a multi-part plan to first create potential designs and proposals; convene economists, lawyers, academics, technologists and others to evaluate these designs; and create a framework for testing the new system, all with the goal of making dollar transactions as seamless as a text message.      The idea isn’t new: The former CFTC officials called for using a blockchain platform to support a digital dollar since an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal last October. Essentially, a non-governmental group would run the project, with support from the Federal Reserve and other stakeholders.      An analog reserve currency does not serve modern users, Giancarlo, the former CFTC chairman, said in a statement Thursday.      “A digital dollar would help future-proof the greenback and allow individuals and global enterprises to make payments in dollars irrespective of space and time,” he said.      The proposed digital dollar would be a tokenized form of the U.S. currency, which would work with other existing Fed liabilities but act as a digital settlement medium.      The digital dollar would “meet the demands of the new digital world and a cheaper, faster and more inclusive global financial system,” Giancarlo said.      Accenture will act as the chief architect and technology partner on the project.      In a statement, Accenture global blockchain lead and managing partner David Treat said the firm would bring together some of the stakeholders to combine both real-world experience and new technological abilities to drive the project.      Giancarlo said Accenture has worked with a number of central banks, including the Bank of Canada, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the European Central Bank, to innovate around existing systems.      In particular, he highlighted the firm’s work with Sweden’s Riksbank on designing the ekrona.      Treat told CoinDesk via a spokesperson that Accenture has already invested heavily in the space, particularly with regard to CBDC and ""the inherent value use cases. CBDCs can also support other digital ledger-based projects, he said.      ""As an example, the ability to directly exchange a CBDC for a tokenized security will have profound effects on global capital markets,"" he said.    Supporting the dollar    To begin with, the foundation will hold meetings, roundtable discussions and open forums to look into different approaches to creating a digital dollar.      “Core governmental interests,” including support for existing Fed projects, will also be considered, the press release noted.      This initial effort will culminate in a set of principles, which will then be compared to stakeholder needs and the practical requirements for a CBDC, as well as evaluated for U.S. legal compliance, the release said.      Fed buy-in is key: The digital dollar would have to be backed by the U.S. central bank, unlike most existing cryptocurrencies and dollar-pegged stablecoins.      Notably, the Digital Dollar Foundation's proposals would look to preserve the existing financial system, not replace or otherwise supersede it, according to the press release.      As such, it is likely to take into account, if not outright coordinate with, the FedNow project, the Fed's real-time payment system. While rumors that the central bank would develop its own digital payment rails have persisted for years, the entity only formally announced the effort last year.      To date, it does not appear as though FedNow will utilize a blockchain, though the project is in an early stage.      Still, what is clear is Fed governors and Chairman Jerome Powell are aware of the technology, and are at least evaluating the potential use of a blockchain to support the system.      U.S. congressmen French Hill (R-Ark.) and Bill Foster (D-Ill.) have even weighed into the debate, asking Powell whether using a blockchain-based CBDC was feasible or worth the effort.      Powell has so far responded that while the Fed is looking into the matter, he doesn't yet see if there will be any significant benefit to pursuing monetary policy with a CBDC.      Gorfine, who previously ran the CFTC's financial technology initiative in LabCFTC, told CoinDesk via email that a number of issues must be worked out before a U.S. CBDC can be issued, including legal, economic, privacy, security and technology concerns.      ""These are some of the issues we intend to explore and we will do so with a broad range of stakeholders through a phased approach that may include actual or proposed pilots,"" he said. ""Ultimately, a digital dollar would need to be issued by the Fed, and our goal is to advance a framework for potential, practical steps that could support such an effort.""    Global needs    Thursday's announcement comes amid growing rumors that China may soon be ready to launch its own central bank digital currency. The full details and scope of China's project are unknown, though it appears possible that the country could try to take on the U.S. dollar's dominance of the global financial system.      It remains to be seen whether a digital renminbi could take on the dollar in dominating the global financial system. Jerry Brito, executive director at industry think tank Coin Center, argued in a blog post the renminbi's fundamentals will not change just because it is placed on a blockchain, and therefore a Chinese CBDC poses no threat to the U.S. dollar.      Still, former senior U.S. government officials and academics have considered the possibility that nations like North Korea could use a digital renminbi to bypass sanctions while hostile actors target the aging infrastructure supporting remittances today, like the SWIFT Network.      Other nations are also looking to issue their own CBDCs. The Marshall Islands is perhaps one of the most advanced, announcing last year it would issue the Marshallese sovereign in two stages: first, a private pre-sale to gauge liquidity, followed by the public issuance sometime within the next two years.      Private groups are also looking to serve the declared need for a global, scalable means of transmission, most famously the Libra stablecoin project, which social media giant Facebook announced in June as an effort to create an international payment system specifically targeting un- or underbanked individuals.      The new digital dollar envisioned by Giancarlo and Gorfine would fulfill the same niche, but act more simply as just the 21st century dollar, however.      “It must … reduce costs, foster security, improve transparency and serve as an effective digital settlement medium nationally and internationally to make the dollar a better currency for all of its global users,” the press release said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/16/former-cftc-officials-ramp-up-push-for-digital-dollar-with-accenture-partnership,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4dfc29363bec781a992a036c690a74b32f733227-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431421,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2LZh,1579182900,Fintech Startup Aims to Create New Asset Class With 'Continuous' ICO Model,"A newly launched fintech firm hopes to leverage the token sale model to back investments in real-world assets. But it's taking a different approach than many previous projects.      Hong Kong-based Two Prime – recently founded by open-source veteran Marc Fleury – calls the sale a Continuous Token Offering (CTO), as opposed to an initial coin offering (ICO) in which most tokens are sold early on. The goal is to use the funds raised to help make crypto a proper new asset class that appeals more to the financial world.      The firm will release an initial five million tokens (just five percent of the 100 million to be created in total) onto the secondary markets, with the rest being released over the next 10 years. That's similar to the approach taken by Ripple with its XRP sales, and the firm said the process resembles equity fundraising.      Two Prime's FF Accretive Token (FF1) will initially to be traded on Japan-based crypto exchange Liquid in late February, starting at $3 per token, the firm said.      “One of the greatest successes of cryptocurrencies is in rapid fund formation, as demonstrated during the initial coin offering boom,” the firm’s chief operating officer, Alexander Blum, said.      According to Blum, seed funding for startups via tokens offerings on exchanges overtook private equity in 2017. “As VCs generally shun the seed stage, [ICOs] filled a niche that traditional financial players left unaddressed,” he said.      Two Prime said the token offer a purchasing option that ""combines the features of a close-ended fund, asset-backed token, and a secure store of value.""      CEO Fleury has committed $2 million of his personal wealth to the fund. The firm also revealed to CoinDesk the first outside investor in its token is Hong Kong-based private equity firm SIB Investment Ltd.      Fleury founded JBoss, an open-source Java-based application server, in 1999. The firm was sold to Red Hat for $420 million in 2006. Red Hat is now owned by IBM.    Regulatory risk    Like with other startups that venture into token offerings, the firm will also have to avoid getting on the wrong side of investors or regulators.      Ripple, which has raked in billions from sales of XRP and equity funding rounds, has been entangled in a class action lawsuit filed by investors who accuse the company of selling unregistered securities.      And a raft of firms have launched ICOs only to later be charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with failing to register their tokens as securities.      Two Prime said it has consulted with law firms in different jurisdiction and think its designed an approach that will reduce the potential challenges from financial regulators.      The firm will initially list the tokens on exchanges in Asia to see how much traction the fund could gain from investors. Then it will consider setting up a special purpose vehicle (SPV) in the U.S. to offer the tokens as a security, according to Fleury.      Unlike many ICOs, the fund’s tokens will be backed by real-world assets, which the firm said would be managed by professional portfolio managers. The underlying assets will comprise a structured portfolio of debts, cryptocurrencies and equity instruments.      The first investments are focused on the blockchain sector, while the firm may in future branch out to other industries such as green technology and smart city management, according to Blum.      ""Our aim is to create a new asset class by applying traditional investment models and theories to crypto and bringing trust and professionalism to the industry,” said Fleury.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/01/16/fintech-startup-aims-to-create-new-asset-class-with-continuous-ico-model,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/54d2cbab9e7c18562b92aa93e3df788a28d64ae3-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431423,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2LXh,1579176000,Winklevoss-Led Gemini Exchange Now Has Its Own Insurance Company,"Gemini, the crypto exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has created its own insurance company to protect clients against the potential loss of coins from its offline vaults – with a possibly record-breaking $200 million coverage limit.      Announced Thursday, the captive insurer will provide coverage for customers of Gemini Custody, the crypto cold storage service of Gemini Trust Company. Typically, cold storage policies cover losses due to insider thefts and collusion, as well as the destruction of private keys by natural disasters like floods, earthquakes and so on. Cold storage refers to the practice of keeping the cryptographic keys controlling a crypto wallet offline, on a hardware device disconnected from the internet or a slip of paper locked in a safe.      Aside from its size, the Gemini policy is another sign the once-meager supply of insurance coverage available to crypto firms is growing – even if they have to create some of it. Last year, insurance broker Aon and crypto exchange Coinbase announced plans to create a captive; Aon said it had captive creation deals with other exchanges in the pipeline.      Gemini’s new policy, which supplements its captive with coverage from outside insurers, has “the largest limit of insurance coverage currently available by any crypto custodian in the world,” said Yusuf Hussain, the company’s head of risk.      He may be right, although it is hard to make apples-to-apples comparisons in this market. Coinbase has said it has $255 million in coverage of assets held in online, or hot, wallets, whereas the new Gemini policy is for cold storage. Other large crypto insurance offerings were previously reported by insurance brokerage Marsh’s Blue Vault, which provided $150 million for coins kept in cold storage.      Gemini’s captive insurance company is dubbed “Nakamoto” after bitcoin’s mysterious creator, and licensed by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA). The Caribbean island is a popular location for insurance carriers, owing to its favorable regulatory environment, particularly when it comes to bespoke products and entities such as captives.      To be clear: As a captive, Nakamoto will insure only Gemini clients, not competitors.    Reinsurance access    Captive insurance subsidiaries, wholly owned by the firm being insured, have been around for a long time in the traditional corporate world and are a common cost-saving approach taken by Fortune 500 companies.      When it comes to crypto, captives create a more formalized way of providing cover than self-insuring, which many large exchanges do by simply holding a big stash of bitcoin. The captive route is advantageous in this respect because it provides access to reinsurance markets (a form of insurance purchased by insurance companies to mitigate risk).      “A captive really broadens Gemini’s access to reinsurance markets which is something they would not have had access to before,” said Sarah Downey, who co-leads the digital asset risk transfer team at Marsh, which, along with Aon, helped arrange the policy. “So in a way, it gives them the opportunity to tap into more coverage and potentially a better rate.”      Aon is acting as Gemini’s captive manager, while Marsh placed the excess coverage (cover against losses over and above that provided by the Nakamoto captive entity) through the direct insurance market.      The excess coverage, for the most part, was placed through the Marsh Blue Vault facility and was led by the Lloyd's syndicate Arch Insurance International in the U.K., said Downey.      Hussain said the way to think about this is a combination of captive and traditional insurance providing a total of $200 million.      “The captive is the primary layer, and the traditional insurance markets are taking the excess layers – and then beyond that customers can procure additional insurance on a client-by-client basis,” he said.      He would not disclose how much of that is being stumped up by Gemini itself in the form of the captive but said, “A majority of it is provided by traditional insurance markets.”    Self-insurance?    The Nakamoto captive completes Gemini’s insurance triumvirate. Firstly, U.S. dollar customer deposits are eligible for FDIC insurance (placed at third-party banks including crypto-friendly Silvergate) and covered up to $250,000.      The second part came with a SOC2 security audit carried out by Deloitte, which enabled Gemini to attain hot wallet cover for funds held on the exchange, a deal also brokered by Marsh.      Hussain said Gemini managed to acquire coverage for its hot wallets back in 2018 – when underwriters had very little appetite for that kind of risk – because of the audit and the ability to show it had no single point of failure.      Quizzed over the limits on offer for hot wallet cover, he said: “It has a different risk profile and our underwriters prevent us from disclosing the amount.""      Some in the crypto space have suggested that operating a captive is really the same as self-insuring. However, Hussain said Gemini’s belt-and-braces approach to regulation (the exchange holds a Trust License from the New York Department of Financial Services) is carried on in the captive model, and that the two insurance approaches are “vastly different.""      “The capital reserve requirements required by a regulated jurisdiction like Bermuda bring regulatory oversight to the captive,” he said.      By contrast, “with self-insurance, an exchange can set aside $100 million and if things get tight, they can go ahead and repurpose that $100 million without notifying anybody and saying, ‘Hey, we need to go invest this elsewhere.’”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/01/16/winklevoss-led-gemini-exchange-now-has-its-own-insurance-company,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c1b3f8bb84a1a8c71bb769fe984ba29e9812655b-1500x903.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431428,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2Lbh,1579172443,Bull Breather? Bitcoin Market Turns Indecisive at Two-Month High,"View    Bitcoin is facing temporary bullish exhaustion, according to Wednesday’s “doji” candle.  The case for a notable pullback will strengthen if prices break below Wednesday’s low of $8,555. That could yield a drop to $8,200.  A move above the hourly chart resistance at $8,705 would allow a re-test of Wednesday’s high near $8,900.    The bitcoin market is telling a tale of bullish exhaustion with indecisive price action following a rise to the highest point since November.      The top cryptocurrency witnessed two-way business on Wednesday. Prices rose from lows near $8,550 seen during the Asian trading hours to a two-month high of $8,903, only to end the day (UTC) on a flat note at $8,808, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      Essentially, bitcoin created a “doji” candle, which is widely considered a sign of indecision in the marketplace.      In this case, however, the candle could be considered a sign of buyer exhaustion, as it has appeared following a sharp rally from $6,850 to $8,900 and suggests the indecision is predominantly among the bulls.      The price action seen so far today is telling the same story. The cryptocurrency fell from $8,800 to $8,575 during the Asian trading hours and has struggled to chart a strong bounce ever since. This is in contrast to the quick reversals from sub-$8,600 levels seen in the previous two days.      At press time, bitcoin is trading near $8,600, representing a one percent drop on a 24-hour basis.    Daily and hourly charts    Bitcoin now risks a deeper pullback below Wednesday’s low of $8,555. A drop through that support would validate buyer exhaustion signaled by the doji candle (above left), attracting selling pressure.      It would also confirm a double-top breakdown on the hourly chart (above right). That would open the doors for $8,210 (target as per the measured move method).      That said, the short-term outlook would turn bearish only if any pullback ends up violating the bullish higher low of $7,667 created Jan. 10.      That, however, looks unlikely with the five- and 10-day averages continuing to trend north. These averages, currently located at $8,508 and $8,276, respectively, tend to reverse pullbacks when they are on an upward trajectory. Further, the longer duration charts have recently turned bullish.

The tax is calculated at an annualized rate of 22 percent, and in this case was based on the amount of foreign withdrawals from Bithumb.

The D.C.-based Value Technology Association (VTA) helped lead the charge in requiring DoD to put together such a hearing, VTA President Jason Brett said in a video interview with CoinDesk at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas last week.      ""What our Value Technology Foundation worked on was a blockchain briefing,” Brett said. “We wanted the military to look at it so they could invest a long period of time in how the blockchain could evolve into something as strong as the internet.”      Such a report could be a boost to the broader industry. ""It requires the military to share with Congress how there might be some private-sector use cases that might be adopted from the way the military might use the blockchain,"" Brett explained.      The blockchain language appears in the conference report based on language in Section 255 of Senate Bill 1790, which passed and was signed into law on Dec. 20. Brett's organization collaborated with the office of Rep. Darren Soto (D-Fla.) to get the language into the report.      The same annual bill has been previously used for similar investigations. In 2017 it launched a cybersecurity study, for example. NATO also recently explored roughly the same topic as this latest requirement.    Risks and rewards    Naturally there is the danger the report will come back with a negative view of the technology.      ""That's obviously the risk you take when you have one of these hearings,"" Brett said. His organization will attempt to frame the issue ahead of any research by the department, however. ""We are writing a white paper right now with eight companies.""      This white paper will explain some of the ways that blockchain could be useful. So, for example, the military is already working on using additive printers to distribute parts rather than shipping them. Such plans could be distributed securely using a distributed ledger, Brett said. The Value Technology Foundation is the latest entrant into blockchain advocacy world in D.C., only founded in June 2019.
