42399634,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAblslR,1487193200,Can A New Method for Monitoring Blockchains Stop Sybil Attacks?,"A group of researchers has proposed a new way to more closely monitor the behavior of nodes that relay information on a blockchain network.  Published by academics at Zhejian University, the National University of Singapore and Tianji University, the paper, the authors believe, could one day help ease cybersecurity issues around the tech.  Within the context of bitcoin, nodes store the network’s transaction history, maintaining and sharing information about the blockchain with connected peers. Yet any peer-to-peer system faces unique kinds of cybersecurity concerns, including Sybil attacks, when fake identities are created and exploited on the network.  ""Sybil attack[s] can be one kind of the [problems]. And there are many other [problems] that may show anomalous behavior patterns,"" researcher Zhenguang Liu told CoinDesk in an email, adding:  ""For example, blockchain nodes that are captured by a hacker may periodically conduct fake transactions, a malignant node may perform frequent transactions with very small amounts to slow down the network.""  Ultimately, they propose what they believe is a method for determining behaviors between nodes, which they think could solve some of those long-held issues – or, at least, provide a way for keeping a closer tab on a blockchain.  The concept is notable given the issues raised around cybersecurity and blockchain, especially by regulators including the EU's top securities watchdog, ESMA. Earlier this month, the agency said that it wouldn't move immediately to draft new regulations for blockchain, but that it still believed cybersecurity concerns to be a major impediment to wider adoption.  An IT regulator within the EU raised similar issues in a report published in January.  Read the full report here.  Alyssa Hertig contributed reporting.

42399637,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAblspN,1487175735,North Dakota’s Bitcoin Regulation Hits Roadblock in New Hearing,"A proposal to study bitcoin regulation in North Dakota has reportedly run into some opposition.  As reported last week by CoinDesk, North Dakota’s legislature has taken up a measure that, if passed, would mandate a study into how the state could approach putting together a legislative framework for the tech.  Bill 2100 was submitted at the request of financial regulators at the end of last year, passing unanimously in the State Senate on 12th February. From there, it advanced to the North Dakota House of Representatives, the state legislature’s lower chamber, being taken up by the Industry, Business and Labor Committee.  Lawmakers convened a hearing on the bill yesterday, and while a video of the hearing was not immediately available at press time, local reports indicate that regulators want to see action on the legislative level due to interest from companies looking to open for business in the state.  Aaron Webb, assistant commissioner for the state’s Department of Financial Institutions, was quoted as saying by local news outlet KFYR:  ""If they do any other business relating to US currency, a lot of times they'll do both, and if they do any US currency money transmission, then they require a license. And we've indicated that we are going to bring this to the legislature for some type of direction.""  Yet according to the outlet, the committee currently considering the measure isn’t on board with it.  That body reportedly gave it a unanimous Do Not Pass recommendation – a determination that could either result in changes to the bill or a decision to abandon it entirely.

42399633,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAblsjT,1487170811,EU Commission: We Plan to Boost Support for Blockchain Projects,"The executive arm of the European Union government is planning to expand its work on blockchain, an official said last week.  According to newly published statements from 7th February by European Commission VP Andrus Ansip, the Commission is planning to grow its “support” for blockchain projects – something that Ansip characterized as an expansion of existing efforts.  It was last spring that the European Parliament approved a task force, led by the Commission, to study blockchain. At the time, MEP Jakob von Weizsäcker framed the measure as a way to monitor the nascent blockchain space while also avoiding new regulations for the time being.  Ansip went into detail about the efforts the Commission is undertaking, both within and beyond the scope of that task force. He highlighted potential technology pilots focused on “decentralised innovation ecosystems”, noting how the Commission has already become involved in several blockchain initiatives.  He told members of the European Parliament:  “The Commission is already supporting [distributed ledger tech]-enabled projects (DECODE, D-Cent, MyHealth MyData). Support activities are going to increase in the coming months (e.g. Decentralised Data Management). A study will be launched to investigate how DLT can help in reshaping public services and preparing for EU specific DLT actions to address relevant EU challenges.”  Ansip went on to say that the Commission would collaborate with the Parliament on future blockchain events, something the latter body has already undertaken in the past.  “The Commission will organise a kick-off conference with the European Parliament on Demystifying Blockchain and a series of workshops to look at Blockchain developments and use case applications,” Ansip said.

42399650,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAblsxF,1487168736,The Next Wave of Ethereum Applications is Almost Here,"While critics have long taken aim at ethereum for a lack of production projects, a new wave of decentralized applications (or 'dapps') is making notable progress.  Over the last few months, a number of long-anticipated ethereum projects have entered alpha and beta, including uPort, which aims to hand users more control of their online identity, and Akasha, a social media app that's been two years in the making.  And some brand new applications have emerged, too.  Aragon, for example, debuted last Friday with the goal of helping anyone launch their own DAO (an autonomous, blockchain-based company), a release that goes to show how new ethereum entrepreneurs are now looking to take forward long-established ideas.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Akasha CEO and ethereum founder Mihai Alisie noted that after months – sometimes years – in incubation, there is a belief that ethereum dapps are ""starting to make their debut"".  Alisie said that he believes its community has ""matured during the last year"", even in the face of what could at best be called obstacles and growing pains for the platform.  In 2016, The DAO, ethereum's largest project to date, dissolved in a matter of months, and later, an attacker took advantage of cheaply priced code functions to spam the network for months on end, slowing down transactions and smart contracts.  But, behind the scenes, work was underway, those close to the development ecosystem say.  Jarrad Hope, the developer of the decentralized ethereum wallet Status, told CoinDesk:  ""I think what we're seeing is the hard, quiet work of the ethereum developer community from the past year.""  The next Web?  Also notable about this batch of projects is their ambition.  Many projects intend to replace existing apps, whether social networks like Facebook or web tools like Google Docs, with new, decentralized versions. Using ethereum's architecture, these apps are designed without a single point of control, though they behave in a similar way to the centralized services they seek to replace.  One already up-and-running app is Ethlance, which connects freelancers with ethereum-related work gigs. Rather than storing the website in a central database, it spreads it across the ethereum network, with the front-end website code stored with the help of the peer-to-peer protocol, IPFS.  Today, there are extra steps users need to take to access the platform – mainly users need to be synched up with ethereum, which means downloading the entire blockchain history via a client like geth or parity.  With Ethlance, the app doesn’t take a cut of earnings. Rather, users need to pay the network a small amount of ether to make any update to their profile. This is because, behind the scenes, a version of the user’s data is being changed on every node in the network.  As with many projects, time will tell if this will prove an off-putting glitch in the user experience, but some believe the overall usability of the platform is improving.  Mattan Field, founder of the ethereum-based publishing platform Backfeed, attributes the uptick to several factors, including the ""maturity of the tech staff"".  ""Overall [there is a] maturity of the space, technical and conceptual,"" he said.  Waiting on ethereum  Like in the cryptocurrency world more broadly, much depends on more forward-looking changes, though. After all, a dapp isn't much use without a fully developed underlying infrastructure.  As acknowledged by its developers, ethereum itself isn't yet production-ready, and some components that it will connect to, like the file-storage system Swarm, remain in progress.  Moving forward with more user-facing apps depends heavily on these pieces of the puzzle being put in place.  Alisie added:  ""There is still a long way to go, but the present points towards a promising future when you also add into the picture [proof of stake], lightning networks and sharding.""  The Raiden Network, a must for any project looking for serious scale, is aimed at boosting the number of possible transactions and some types of smart contracts on ethereum. It's scheduled for a minimal release in 2017 — perhaps as soon as March.  Other solutions, however, are likely to only come with time.  Web of dependencies  Going forward, it remains to be seen whether the protocol's technical improvements can keep pace with entrepreneur aspirations.  Akasha and uPort, for instance, are both dependent on IPFS for a system of decentralized storage, while Akasha ultimately aims one day to add support for uPort for identity purposes.  Yet, others believe the sheer number of ethereum developers will help the protocol overcome its current growing pains.  The new phase for dapps perhaps go hand-in-hand with lower-level fine-tuning as protocol developers gear up for Metropolis, a more advanced version of ethereum expected for release this year.  Other planned changes don't exist yet – 'sharding' is in early stages, and the network's new consensus algorithm Casper is very much a work in progress. With this in mind, it’s less clear when protocol engineers will be able to make big underlying changes.  Hope, however, noted that developers will likely have to take a leap of faith in this regard, one based on their confidence in institutions like the Ethereum Foundation and its developer team.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Ethereum is bleeding-edge technology, in this space you have to build for the future. When it comes to the underlying protocols it often requires leaps of faith.""

42399621,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjuYe,1487166625,Microsoft Teams With KPMG to Launch Blockchain Workspace Network,"Tech giant Microsoft and professional services firm KPMG have announced the opening of new innovation workshops focused on blockchain development.  Dubbed ""Blockchain Nodes"", the workspaces are intended to serve as hubs for collaborative work on use cases, particularly those focused on finance applications. Of note is that the news expands an existing partnership, one that expanded last year that cover joint work on blockchain.  The latest announcement deepens that relationship, as the two firms are opening offices in Singapore and Frankfurt, with the intention to open a third location in New York at a later date.  Eamonn Maguire, KPMG chief for Digital Ledger Services, said in a statement:  ""The Blockchain Nodes will play a critical role in identifying new applications and use cases that blockchain can address. They will enable us to work directly with clients to discover and test ideas based on market insights, creating and implementing prototype solutions that use this innovative technology.""  The announcement also points to the growing trend of enterprise-focused firms establishing blockchain workspaces around the world.  Professional services firm Deloitte, for example, has opened labs in Dublin and New York in the past year, while IBM has launched a network of ""garages"", in part to develop applications of the technology.

42399624,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjuca,1487163634,Post-Trade Giant NSD: Blockchain 'Useless' If Not Legally Binding,"After nearly two years of experimenting with blockchain, the National Settlement Depository (NSD), Russia's central securities depository, believes it now knows what incumbents must do to reap benefits from the tech.  The largest securities depository in Russia, the NSD has found that there are only a few cases where blockchain solutions can provide benefits over centralized alternatives, and that there are two criteria it uses for determining a 'good' distributed ledger use case.  According to the NSD's director of innovation, Artem Duvanov, the first is that blockchains should only be used to record legally binding information.  ""Blockchain is useless if it stores information that has no legal consequences,"" he told CoinDesk in a new interview.  The remarks follow a number of smaller announcements from the NSD about its blockchain work in recent months. In April 2016, the NSD first revealed it had launched a distributed ledger trial, and by the year's end, it had announced collaborations with two other global central securities depositories (CSDs).  Duvanov said that, through these trials, the NSD has determined a second criterion: that blockchain must be used as a tool to satisfy ""non-functional requirements"" in a multi-party environment.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Centralized systems are inherently vulnerable to operational, legal, and cybersecurity risks. Blockchain allows us to mitigate these risks with lower costs that can be achieved through enhancement of traditionally digitized collaboration in multi-party environment with additional reconciliations, audits and other external means.""  The findings come on the heels of an uptick in activity at global CSDs – the large, often national entities that provide a central point for the depositing and settlement of financial instruments.  The most active to date has been the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) in the US, which revealed in January that it would seek to migrate its derivatives processing to a distributed ledger system sometime in 2018.  Multi-party benefits  But, what does it mean for a blockchain solution to enhance digital collaboration?  Duvanov described the NSD's proxy voting trial as an example of what the organization believes to be a true use case for a blockchain or distributed ledger.  As explained in its 2016 announcement, the NSD is using a test blockchain to process messages between the issuers of securities within a digital environment, ensuring that all votes are properly ""submitted and accounted for"".  ""[In this case,] blockchain doesn’t bring new functions for customers, end investors or issuers, but it ensures a voting environment with dramatically less operational, legal and cybersecurity risks,"" he said.  Though Duvanov did not provide any updates on the state of the trial, he described proxy voting as the company's ""main business case"" relating to the technology.  Created through a merger in 2010, the NSD provides services in clearing, securities settlement, cash settlement and asset servicing, support tools including equities and money market instruments. It later gained CSD status in 2012.  Confidentiality concerns  But while the NSD believes it has gleaned insights from its work with the tech, the organization is still grappling with many of the same challenges as its peers.  ""The main obstacle for implementation of blockchain in corporate environment is lack of confidentiality mechanisms in existing blockchain platforms,"" Duvanov said.  The statements follow an uptick in interest around privacy in blockchain systems, with enterprise blockchain firms debuting new tech in recent months aimed at providing solutions to this long-held concern.  It's here, however, that Duvanov said the industry can expect the NSD to soon make a contribution, as he projects the firm will provide a ""limited solution"" to the Linux-led Hyperledger blockchain project this year.  For now, however, Duvanov suggests industry observers may want to caution their expectations for the technology's growth, arguing that that while it can decentralize recordkeeping, this does not mean it can create sweeping change.  Duvanov concluded:  ""Blockchain cannot completely remove intermediaries. That was the widespread belief.""

42399618,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjuVh,1487160016,Will New Regulations Help or Hurt Bitcoin Startups in the Philippines?,"Luis Buenaventura is CTO of BloomSolutions, a Philippines-based remittance firm, and the author of the e-book ""Reinventing Remittances with Bitcoin"".  In this CoinDesk opinion piece, Buenaventura gives his take on new regulations aimed at bitcoin businesses in the Philippines. Cost burden aside, he argues, there's reason for entrepreneurs to be optimistic about the changes.  With everyone from Abra to ZipZap using it as either a launch market or a base of regional operations, the Philippines has long been the hub of innovation for bitcoin remittance companies.  Local founders have said it was only a matter of time before the central bank, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), would come around to regulating the industry, and that process finally began in early February of this year.  That's when when BSP deputy governor Nestor Espenilla announced the central bank would issue a circular that intended to clear up the government's position on bitcoin and other cryptocurrency exchanges.  At the time, Espenilla noted that monthly domestic bitcoin volumes in the Philippines had jumped from $1m in 2015, to $5m–$6m the following year, and it was time for guidelines. That circular is now available (BSP Circular No 944), and will take effect by the end of the month.  On the surface, the circular appears to take some of its cues from the Japanese Financial Services Agency, which published its own set of regulations for bitcoin exchanges last year, and that take effect this April.  But, there are differences as well.  Overall, the preamble emphasizes the BSP's position around encouraging innovation and financial inclusion – a welcome, if somewhat perfunctory, statement in light of what else the circular contains.  The release reads:  ""The Bangko Sentral recognizes that virtual currency systems have the potential to revolutionize delivery of financial services, particularly for payments and remittance, in view of their ability to provide faster and more economical transfer of funds, both domestic and international, and may further support financial inclusion.""  Casting a broad net  That's not to say the circular is without its weak spots.  Because of the way Philippine startups have been using bitcoin over the past three years, it appears that the BSP has latched on to this single use case more than any other.  The BSP does not appear to have a regulatory position on virtual currencies as an investment, a payment rail, a gambling platform or as a mechanism for offshoring personal assets – all of which are more common use cases for the technology than remittances.  And what exactly is a virtual currency, in the eyes of the central bank?  Here, the BSP is casting an extremely broad net.  ""VCs shall be broadly construed to include digital units of exchange that (1) have a centralized repository or administrator; (2) are decentralized and have no centralized repository or administrator; or (3) may be created or obtained by computing or manufacturing effort.""  Perhaps it’s in the interest of efficiency – these guidelines cover both centralized and decentralized currencies, blockchain-based or not.  It potentially also covers technology that doesn’t even exist yet, as it’s not entirely clear what it even means to 'manufacture' a virtual currency.  Exchange rules  But, the BSP does take care to distinguish 'virtual currencies' from 'mobile money' – Warcraft gold, Starbucks points and frequent-flier miles. (In the Philippines, mobile money is covered by a different, arguably more stringent, set of regulations.)  Elsewhere, the definition of 'virtual currency exchange' proves tricky.  For one, it does not just cover 'VC exchanges' in the way one would expect. It's been written to include bitcoin wallets and bitcoin payment processors – indeed, any service that facilitates currency conversion. (A wallet provider would be exempt if they did not exchange bitcoin for fiat, but those types of services would have little use in the Philippines.)  Virtual currency exchanges will further have to obtain a certificate of registration (CoR) with the Anti-Money Laundering Council Secretariat, and also pay annual service fees.  The document it refers to is a previous circular (No 942), which breaks down the various fees that need to be paid. In most cases, the registration fees come out to a little over $2,000, with annual service fees amounting to the same.  Essentially, all VC exchanges are now to be treated as remittance companies.  Effects on the industry  On the face of it, a first-year fee of $2,000 is no higher than any traditional money services business in the Philippines would be expected to pay, so it’s not altogether unfair.  The bigger challenge will be figuring out how to incorporate the mandatory compliance and reporting workflow without affecting costs. In most cases, this would involve hiring additional personnel and retaining legal advice.  So what does this mean for the bitcoin industry in the Philippines?  Overall, it’s good news that the government is finally recognizing startups that have been laboring in a legal gray area since 2013. It’s also encouraging that they’ve spent enough time to learn about bitcoin to understand what it’s good at.  It certainly appears like the intention is to treat any business dealing with bitcoin as a remittance agent, even if remittances aren’t the primary purpose of that company. But perhaps most importantly, they do not offer a temporary sandbox status to startups with more experimental models.  It will take a while to fully understand the impact of all these new regulations.  For now, the hope is that it won’t decelerate the innovative momentum that has built up over the past few years in one of the most important regions in the world’s most populous continent.

42399620,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjuWg,1487156428,Why Blockchain Firms Shouldn't Ignore New EU Cybersecurity Laws,"Jacek Czarnecki is an attorney at Warsaw-based law firm Wardynski & Partners, where he specializes in areas including FinTech, digital currencies and blockchain.  In this opinion piece, Czarnecki discusses European regulatory developments beyond blockchain, arguing that some laws under review outside the industry's oversight could prove impactful to its practices.  We know that 'virtual currencies' (the term to be hardwired into European Union law) will be covered by new anti-money laundering and terrorist financing regulations.  But, while the details on this industry-specific regulation will follow shortly, there are also other pieces of the EU legislation that deserve attention in the meantime.  Going forward, it is quite clear that blockchain as a technology will primarily attract the attention of regulators interested in particular applications.  Lawyers, by and large, think about bitcoin from the perspective of financial regulations or look at smart contracts from the point of view of contract law. This is not necessarily correct, (smart contracts may replace not just legal contracts, for example), but it shows a pattern of thinking that we may be wise to keep in mind going forward.  Namely, that other use cases of blockchain will require legal analysis based on specific areas they impact.  Am I regulated?  This has one important consequence: the regulations that may apply to any specific blockchain use case aren't clear.  In other words, depending on particular applications of blockchain, different laws may apply. For example, token crowdsales will be scrutinized under securities regulation, since they very often serve the same aim as IPOs, or at least have very similar economic meaning.  Naturally, this should not come as a surprise. The internet might provide a useful example.  We are already used to the fact that different activities performed over the internet may trigger wide range of various regulations, such as consumer protection, personal data protection or intellectual property law.  The practical result is that blockchain projects will often require legal analysis to determine what kind of regulation will apply to a particular application (if any).  This should be also taken into account by lawmakers and regulators. New legislation, even if not drafted with blockchain in mind, may cause side effects that can stifle innovation.  Changing data laws  With this in mind, we've recently seen a number of other regulations that, while not specifically aimed at the technology, could nonetheless impact its growth.  Examples include the new personal data protection framework in the EU, which – although declared as 'technologically neutral' – may potentially cause conflicts.  Another interesting example is the EU's directive on security of network and information systems (the NIS Directive, also dubbed as cybersecurity directive), adopted in 2016. Some of its provisions, which are going to become binding law in 2018, pose questions with regard to blockchain projects.  The new directive is important for the private sector, because it imposes cybersecurity obligations on some entities, including certain rules of handling cybersecurity incidents or obligations to take specific measures to manage risks in such systems.  The NIS Directive sets forth three types of digital services: online marketplace, online search engine and cloud computing.  Cloud computing  The cloud computing service is particularly interesting here.  The cybersecurity directive defines it as a ""digital service that enables access to a scalable and elastic pool of shareable computing resources"". While the definition of cloud computing isn't controversial, it is worth noting that it can be interpreted broadly.  The directive itself confirms that a wide interpretation should be applied when it says that ""cloud computing services span a wide range of activities that can be delivered according to different models"".  What does it mean for blockchain technology and its applications?  The first consequence is that some activities such as cloud mining can be covered by the above definition.  Much more interesting is how the new regulation will apply to ethereum and similar solutions. Services provided via ethereum (which is a kind of a distributed computing platform) may potentially fall within the above mentioned definition of a cloud computing service.  In such a situation, providers of such services will be subject to obligations set forth in the cybersecurity directive. It is even more interesting if we think of distributed services that cannot be easily attributed to any specific provider.  We will know the scale of issues following from potential application of the cybersecurity directive to blockchain-related matters when the law is implemented by the EU member states. However, it already gives us an idea how various regulations may, sometimes surprisingly, apply to applications of blockchain technology.
