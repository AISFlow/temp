42400767,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKWu5,1512164722,Sidechains Project Pushes Ahead with Bitcoin BIP Submission,"One of the developers behind the Drivechain project for bringing sidechains to bitcoin is seeking feedback on the project's code as well as two improvement proposals related to the tech.  In a message on the bitcoin development email thread, Paul Sztorc posted links for two proposed Bitcoin Improvement Protocols (BIPs), both of which were dated Nov. 17, in an effort to begin getting feedback on the code developed thus far. The release comes just over two years after Sztorc first introduced Drivechain, marking one of several ongoing efforts to develop applications around the concept.  Sidechains concepts, including Drivechain, have been positioned as a way to test new functionalities for bitcoin without actually integrating them within the cryptocurrency's code.  If implemented, they would effectively constitute interoperable blockchains that are pegged to the bitcoin blockchain. For example, a sidechain based on the transaction anonymity project Mimblewimble could allow for experimentation in that area that avoids the long and potentially contentious process of making changes to the bitcoin software.  At the same time, some developers have criticized the sidechains concepts, arguing that they, if introduced, could create new vulnerabilities in the system and lead to a less secure network.  For now, the BIPs put forward by the Drivechain developers are available for review – ""The most helpful review will probably take place on GitHub,"" Sztorc wrote in the email thread – and as he indicated, neither have been granted formal BIP status.

As previously reported, the lawsuits stem from Tezos' $232 million initial coin offering (ICO), which was completed earlier this year. Yet months after the token sale was finished, details of an internal power struggle between founders Kathleen and Arthur Breitman, and the head of the Switzerland-based Tezos Foundation, Johann Gevers, were made public.  And while the Breitmans initially sought to assuage fears over the future of the project, allegations of fraud and misrepresentation have been advanced in what are now three ongoing proposed class-action lawsuits. As the National Law Review reported earlier this week, the latest complaint was filed on Nov. 26 in California.  Those growing legal problems have led the Breitmans to seek out financial support from the Tezos Foundation, according to Reuters.  Citing anonymous sources, the news service reports that Breitmans want help in covering the expenses related to the lawsuits. Gevers, the Swiss-based foundation's head, told the wire service he could not comment on the report.  The Breitmans have been being accused of violating federal securities laws and defrauding their ICO's contributors, since they have yet to launch their proposed smart contracts network, and allegedly selling unregistered securities, in the form of their unreleased native ""tezzies"" token, to contributors.  Brian Klein, an attorney for the Breitmans, did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.

42400770,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKWv4,1512154844,'Microraiden' Payment Channels Go Live on Ethereum Network,"A streamlined version of the Raiden payments channel network has been launched on the main ethereum blockchain.  Activated yesterday  , the launch comes months after µRaiden – known more commonly as ""microraiden"" – first launched on an ethereum test net. The idea behind the project, which is a simpler take on the still-in-development Raiden network, is to provide a mechanism for micropayments similar to bitcoin's Lightning network.  Like Lightning, Raiden is envisioned as a way to scale the ethereum network by building a second layer that would exist above the blockchain. Using the second layer, participants could create payment channels that allow them to transact at a lower cost, whether they are sending ethers (the cryptocurrency of the ethereum network) or ERC-20 compatible tokens.  With Microraiden, the development team aimed to build tools for decentralized application (dapp) developers to open up payment channels, eschewing some of the more complex features intended for the full Raiden launch.  ""Talking to dapp developers, we noticed that many of them just want to use the Raiden Network as a robust many-to-one payment channel system; one service provider offering services to many recurring customers,"" the team wrote back in September.  On Github, developer Lefteris Karapetsas wrote yesterday that the version being released is aimed at sussing out any bugs in the code, adding that a limit has been placed on the maximum amount of Raiden tokens (RDN) that can be deposited for making payments.  ""This is a bug bounty main net release. We recommend using only small amounts of RDN as channel deposits. To that end, we have limited the maximum deposit to 100 RDN,"" he wrote.

""Oh how I wish I took your advice all the many moons ago,"" a friend commented on my nostalgic Facebook post about the bitcoin price hitting $10,000.  I reply.  ""I wish I had taken more of my advice.""  When I tell people I acquired my first bitcoin around the $14 mark, most people then ask whether I'm one of those famed ""bitcoin millionaires.""  I'm not. And sometimes that really hurts to admit.  Seeing bitcoin eclipse $10,000 brought about a feeling of missing out.  There was a blur over the day. Is this really happening? Did that really happen?  What the hell have I been doing?  I was once a young, starry-eyed bitcoin n00b, writing about its march towards $100 a coin. I believed in it then, but with the push towards utilizing it as a payments rail, spent bitcoin here and there on dinners and tech toys and drinks.  And as activist and writer Brett Scott tweeted: ""It's only got to this point because some of us actually used it to buy things in the real world in the past.""  I bought into the ether presale, because I believed there would not be just one winner, and although I made a couple thousand dollars on its initial rise, I had just gotten off a six-month road trip and had $300 to my name, so cashed out at around $7 a coin.  Seven dollars a coin. Ether has traded for more than $500 a coin this week. Based on some not very precise math, if I'd have held, I'd have a cool $150,000 – not a millionaire, but that's an amount of money I have never expected to see in an account I control all at once.  For, as skeptical as I became about all the ""change the world"" rhetoric, I still believed bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies needed to exist as counter-forces to the traditional system that was wreaking havoc on the world, but still I didn't buy.  Consuming so much knowledge about the inner-workings of this system got in the way.  Seeing what other rabbit holes my interest in crypto could take me got in the way.  Life got in the way.  I missed out.  But that's not right. I've been here, right here, in the thick of it for the past five years.  And whether or not I can buy a fucking Ferrari or pay in full in cash for a quarter of a million dollar apartment, I'm a bitcoiner.  And seeing how far a nerdy, little community has come is really inspiring.  It's why I got the bitcoin symbol tattooed on my leg. It's not because I think it'll destroy the dollar or collapse the state; it's not because I think it's underlying technology will make financial institutions and a whole host of different enterprises run more effectively; it's not even because I think most of the people in the industry are shining examples of altruism.  It's because bitcoin is an alternative, a counter-power, the resistance.  And dammit, it's shown the resistance can work.  It shows we can make our own things valuable. We can decide when we've had enough.  ""If you had bought bitcoin when I told you to...,"" I tell my brother as parting knowledge as I head to the airport and back to New York.  ""Well, now what should I invest in?"" he asks.  ""I'm looking into it.""  But will I?  One Facebook comment gives me comfort: ""You're worth millions in spirit … which is just as tangible as bitcoin.""

ManageGo vice president of business strategy Chaim Lowenstein told Technical.ly that the company does not intend to invest or hold the cryptocurrencies, but will instead immediately convert into fiat money.  He told the news source:  ""We saw we could do this and take the risk out of it by converting it. … It would be like if someone wanted to pay with marbles and we could convert marbles overnight.”  The New York-based company does not own any or manage any properties outright, but instead runs a payment and maintenance platform for landlords and tenants.

As per CoinMarketCap, bitcoin (BTC) moved above $10,500 after the news this morning that the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFCT) had approved the listing of three such products from CBOE, CME Group and Cantor Fitzgerald.  At press tine, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had added 3.9 percent on the news, bringing gains to 11 percent over the last 24 hours.  The chart above shows:  The falling trendline has been breached.  A higher lows pattern has been established.  The relative strength index is bullish (above 50.00) and rising.  As such, it appears bitcoin could revisit $11,000 with the position push. However, the longer duration charts favor consolidation as discussed here.  It's also possible the move may have been largely factored in already. (The CME Group talked about their plans to list BTC futures on Nov. 1. Since then, BTC has appreciated by 69 percent.)  One of the big reasons behind the rally to record highs above $11,300 has been a possible surge in the inflow of yield-hungry institutional money into bitcoin via the derivatives market.  View  While 1-hour chart does favor further upside, caution is still advised as the good news may have been priced-in. Also long duration charts signal bull market exhaustion.  As noted here, consolidation followed by a 1-hour close above $10,850 on the back of stronger volumes could yield a more sustainable rally.

First unveiled in an announcement by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the regulator said all three companies will pursue a self-certified initial listing, after working with the agency to set a standard for the offerings.  The reveal comes just weeks after CME indicated via its website that it would launch the product on December 11, before retracting the remarks, and months after CBOE revealed it, too, would seek to launch a futures product.  Both CME and CBOE will offer cash-settled contracts that will find investors buying exposure to different reference rates that will not require custody of the asset. CME will use a custom reference rate created with partner Crypto Facilities, while CBOE intends to use data from the New York-based cryptocurrency exchange Gemini.  Cantor Exchange, a subsidiary of Cantor Fitzgerald, will offer bitcoin binary options beginning on the above date.  However, in remarks, CFTC Commissioner J. Christopher Giancarlo was quick to caution against the idea that the products would be regulated under its full oversight, noting its ""limited statutory ability"" to oversee the underlying cash markets for bitcoin trading.  He said:  ""Market participants should take note that the relatively nascent underlying cash markets and exchanges for bitcoin remain largely unregulated markets over which the CFTC has limited statutory authority. There are concerns about the price volatility and trading practices of participants in these markets.""  Elsewhere, the CFTC sought to frame itself as a participant in the launch, indicating it had held discussions with CME, Cantor and CBOE for months prior to today's news.  The regulator also indicated that it would maintain a close watch on the nascent market for bitcoin-tied financial products. The CFTC said that it intends to ""assess whether further changes are required to the contract design and settlement processes and work with the [designated contract markets] to effect any changes"" over time.  Ready to trade  Warnings aside, those listing the products expressed optimism about their release.  In remarks, Terry Duffy, CME Group chairman and CEO, said he believes the Chicago-based exchange, as well as its peers, have put in place the necessary safeguards for the listing.  ""We are pleased to bring bitcoin futures to market after working closely with the CFTC and market participants to design a regulated offering that will provide investors with transparency, price discovery and risk transfer capabilities.""  At launch, Duffy explained the bitcoin futures product will be subject to risk management tools, including a margin of 35 percent, position and intraday price limits.

Despite the high volume retreat from a record price above $11,300, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been able to avoid a break below the $9,000 mark.  The cryptocurrency was last seen trading at $10,040. As per CoinMarketCap, bitcoin (BTC) is trading unchanged on the day.  Comments on social media indicate the investor community feels bitcoin may have topped out above $11,000 for now and a healthy correction would shake out the weak hands, thereby opening doors for a more sustained rally to new record highs.  That said, the price chart analysis seems to suggest a consolidation is more likely to be the name of the game in the short-run.  4-hour chart  The above chart shows:  The follow-through to bearish doji reversal has been weak (bears have not been able to cut through the low of the big red candle sitting next to doji).  The rising trend line is intact, and the 50-moving average (MA), 100-MA, and 200-MA are sloping upwards in favor of the bulls.  Volumes have dropped (as shown by the falling trend line on volume bars), indicating the pullback is nothing more than a healthy correction.  The relative strength index (RSI) is bottoming out.  All considered, odds are high that bitcoin holds around $10,000.  However, that does not necessarily mean fresh record highs are in the offing today. The daily chart shows strong signs of bull market exhaustion or indecision at record highs.  Bitcoin chart  The above chart shows:  Two consecutive doji candles, which indicate indecision in the marketplace.  The RSI shows overbought conditions.  View  A consolidation around $10,000 (+$1,000/-$1,000) is likely over the next 24 to 36 hours.  Bullish scenario: Consolidation around $10,000 for the next 24 to 36 hours, followed by 1-hour close above $10,850 on the back of stronger volumes would open doors for a rally to fresh record highs.  Bearish scenario: A close below the rising trend line could yield a deeper sell-off to $7,800, although the upward sloping 10-day MA indicates the dip could be short-lived.

42380072,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LyGZ,1512118818,World Computer? New Protocol Could Supercharge Ethereum Blockchain,"With scaling the center of attention in the public blockchain sector, an older but lesser known attempt to overcome the restrictions inherent in ethereum is getting a refresh.  Revealed in an exclusive interview with CoinDesk, a new TrueBit protocol is being released this December, one that removes the ethereum ""gas limit,"" which today puts an upper-bound on the number of computations the network can achieve, bringing the second largest blockchain by market capitalization closer to its oft-touted goal of becoming a ""world computer.""  While TrueBit is one of many in-progress scaling solutions being engineered for the ethereum platform – working alongside mechanisms such as sharding, state channels and Raiden – it distinguishes itself by focusing on the computational power of the network at large, instead of just transaction speed.  Geared specifically towards heavy computations, such as those video broadcasting and machine learning would require, TrueBit could resolve the fact that ethereum is still about as fast as a ""smartphone from 1999,"" as ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin joked last year.  ""In short, the new scheme would be a vast simplification of the current TrueBit protocol,"" said Zack Lawrence, the co-founder of 1protocol, who developed the technology.  And these gains all came about after speculation that someone could exploit the protocol, after an amendment to its white paper was released last month.  Jason Teutsch, a mathematician and co-founder of TrueBit, framed the speculation, and the process for patching the vulnerability, with a silver lining:  ""When so many people have eyes on the papers, over time, you get more and more confident that it's correct, but it's always an ongoing process for these things that are living systems... Now, we go another layer down the protocol rabbit hole, it's this iterative process of getting deeper and deeper into this.""  Hit the jackpot?  And going deeper led the devs to the incentive mechanism used in the protocol.  TrueBit aims to remove the gas limit on ethereum by moving computations off-chain – outsourcing them to an external marketplace that rewards participants for solving and verifying the computations. Within the marketplace ""task givers"" pay ""verifiers"" to solve computations in exchange for rewards, while ""validators"" check that the computations are correct.  To make sure everyone runs effectively, Truebit relies on an incentive scheme dubbed the ""forced errors jackpot,"" which ensures validators are actively checking for correctness by requiring verifiers to occasionally submit incorrect information. If a validator finds these forced errors, they're rewarded with a substantial payout: the ""jackpot.""  But according to Lawrence, that process can be a lot less complicated.  Within the new protocol, anyone can submit what they think is the correct solution to a problem. If another participant finds an error, they can submit what they believe the computation should be and enter that into the verification game. All the potential answers are then pooled together until a consensus is reached.  Because that verification pool is costly to participants, the protocol incentivizes them to work together honestly so disputes do not occur, since the reaching consensus within that verification pool would be costly for everyone.  Not only does this iteration eliminate the security flaws pointed out when the amendment was released, but it's also easier to implement and could increase the number of computations participants are willing to perform since it eliminates the once-every-so-often jackpot, Lawrence told CoinDesk.  Security challenge  Still, the new protocol may not be the last step in evolving TrueBit to achieve optimum efficiency.  Teutsch explained that both versions of the protocol will still hit against eventual limits when it comes to massive computations. If, for example, verification takes too long or gets too expensive, those who notice errors might be inclined to keep quiet, and just let them go.  ""Remember that the verification game is really slow compared to native computation, so my concern expressed here is more than just theoretical,"" he said.  Plus, because TrueBit is a protocol built on game theory (rather than relying on more familiar security auditing processes), Teutsch said, its ""security is an observational science,"" in which devs try to put themselves in every position an attacker might be in.  Because of this, Teutsch said the developers may decide to run both the original protocol (now internally nicknamed TrueBit Classic) and the new protocol in parallel for better security.  But nodding to the fact that digital security is an immensely challenging prospect that takes continual work, Teutsch told CoinDesk:  ""Full confidence happens once you have all the money in the world behind it, and it's sat there for a few years.""

42380065,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Ly7l,1512107146,Bank of Canada Paper Weighs Central Bank-Issued Cryptocurrency,"Central banks might benefit from issuing cryptographic versions of fiat currencies, but the benefits would vary depending on whether they did so in an advanced or developing economy.  At least that's according to Ben Fung from the Central Bank of Canada and Walter Engert from the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, both of whom published a paper this week discussing the pros and cons for central banks issuing cryptocurrencies.  Notably, the paper ends on the question of whether it's worth it for such institutions to offer cash or central bank digital currency (CBDC), should such demand drop deeply enough, though it ties the query to the idea this would need to come at the expense of cash use.  It reads:  ""Is it sufficient for a central bank to supply only reserves to qualified financial institutions? Put differently, is a 'cashless society' a sound outcome?""  The paper goes on to explore six different supposed benefits to a central bank for issuing a digital currency, but largely dismisses all but three: payments for consumers, financial inclusion and stability.  For consumer payments, the authors write that a ""CBDC would facilitate transactions that are currently foregone because of frictions that inhibit some types of transactions."" In particular, it would reduce friction for online payments and entice smaller merchants to offer services over the internet. In some economies, they also see benefits in reducing costs for retail payments to consumers.  The authors argue that financial inclusion would only really benefit in developing economies, though it cites several other existing solutions around the world (such as Africa's M-PESA system) that seem to be closing the gaps just as well as digital currency could.  ""Financial inclusion does not provide a compelling motivation for CBDC in most advanced economies, including Canada,"" they write.  Lastly, the paper gives mixed results for improved financial stability.  On the one hand, ""the financial systems in Canada and other countries feature highly levered banks conducting liquidity and maturity transformation and operating at the core of the payment system,"" the authors write. ""It is well known that under some conditions this set-up can be unstable, and in severe cases the stock of inside money can contract, with adverse negative externalities for the economy.""  Digital money would give consumers a largely risk-free way to store value without exposure to that risk. On the other hand, the ease of leaving bank deposits for a fiat crypto could accelerate financial turmoil.

42380071,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LyE3,1512102657,"Bitfinex and Tether Break Silence, Go on Media Blitz","After months of radio silence, Bitfinex, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, and Tether, the issuer of a dollar-pegged cryptocurrency, are responding to accusations of mismanagement.  In a statement emailed late Thursday to reporters, Ronn Torossian, a newly hired outside spokesman for both companies, blamed ""questionable actors"" for raising doubts about their financials and controls. Notwithstanding critics, he wrote, Bitfinex is ""committed to becoming the most transparent crypto exchange in the industry.""  Specifically, he called out ""Bitfinex'd,"" the pseudonymous blogger who has thrown shade on the exchange in a series of lengthy Medium posts and YouTube videos.  ""Who is Bitfinex’s biggest critic? An anonymous online Twitter user who throws allegations around without ever revealing his or her own identity,"" Torossian wrote, adding:  ""[W]henever someone lobs accusations and attacks behind the veil of anonymity, one has to question their motives.""  By contrast, Torossian went on to say, ""[f]ar from hiding in anonymity, Bitfinex is led by a strong management team."" However, his statement did not name any of the managers, and as of Thursday evening they were still not listed on Bitfinex's website.  The company is run by CEO Jan Ludovicus van der Velde, Chief Strategy Officer Phil Potter and Chief Financial Officer Giancarlo Devasini, Torossian said in a email.  Audit coming soon  The statement is also noteworthy for acknowledging that Tether is ""related"" to Bitfinex.  The link between the two organizations was long the subject of speculation but only recently confirmed by documents contained in the leaked Paradise Papers, which showed that Potter was a director and Devanisi a shareholder of Tether.  The New York Times cited the document in a recent lengthy article about the controversies surrounding Bitfinex. (Tether's website did not identify any of its leaders as of Thursday night, either.)  On a related matter, Torossian addressed concerns raised by many of the companies' critics about Tether's reserves.  A full audit ""will be released as soon as possible,"" he wrote, noting that an interim report found the company had $442.9 million of cash as of Sept. 15 to ""fully back"" the tether tokens.  However, that report, from auditor Friedman LLP of East Hanover, N.J., contained some caveats. The account where the cash is held is in the name of a trustee, and Friedman said it could not vouch that Tether had any enforceable agreement with the trustee.  Similarly, Friedman said in the interim report that it did not evaluate the terms of the bank account and could not attest to Tether's ability to withdraw funds or whether the money had been pledged for anything other than redeeming tokens. (The bank's name is redacted in the publicly available version of the report.)  Reached by CoinDesk Thursday evening, Torossian said the disclaimers were standard for financial reports of privately held companies.  Meanwhile, Tether is ""working closely with law enforcement"" to investigate the breach it reported this month, in which $30 million worth of tether tokens were allegedly taken, Torossian wrote in the statement.  Quiet period  Returning to Bitfinex, Torossian also apologized for the exchange's long silence, though he claimed the company's growing exchange volume was the culprit.  Speaking of financial institutions, Torossian acknowledged that, like many cryptocurrency exchanges, Bitfinex has lost ""a number of U.S.-based banking relationships."" Though he did not name any of them, Wells Fargo is a well-known example.  But the exchange ""was able to maintain and add to its roster of banking partners around the world,"" Torossian added, ""providing the vast majority of its customers with a diversified and resilient banking network to provide consistent liquidity."" He did not name any of those banks, either.  Nor did Torossian directly address speculation by Bitfinex'd and others that the exchange has been printing tether tokens to drive up the price of bitcoin.  ""Bitfinex abides by all existing laws and reporting requirements such as KYC/AML,"" he wrote. The exchange ""works closely with financial regulators, law enforcement, compliance personnel, and financial institutions to provide the highest possible level of protection and service for its customers.""

42380070,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LyCn,1512093618,Bitcoin Is an Emerging Systemic Risk,"Preston Byrne is an independent consultant and founder of Tomram LLC and the former chief operating officer of Monax Industries, an enterprise blockchain software vendor.      Recent news stories make it pretty clear that the new people in bitcoin have no idea what they’ve gotten themselves into.  Bitcoin is the Gom Jabbar of high finance. Cypherpunks who have populated the space to date hold the line because they do not care about money, and therefore do not fear.  These new people are different. The only reason they are here is the money.  They reek of fear.  When we consider that money from fresh, naive amateurs is flowing into the sector at a rate of millions of people per month, we should also understand that these amateurs are more susceptible to the animal spirits than their stoic, abrasive, less-socially-adept, battle-hardened forebears.  They will be prone to cut and run.  As such, a shock to the system, such as an exchange being taken down in a necessary and overdue enforcement action, could lead to a loss in confidence in the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem as a whole and a stampede for the exits the likes of which bitcoin has not seen to date.  In a recent post on my own blog, I pointed out that bitcoin, by setting itself up as a sort of decentralized bank, was also creating an unreasonable expectation to its new ""depositors"" that they will always be able to redeem their assets at par, given a wild mismatch between its $200 billion ""market cap"" and new investor money – which is clearly well shy of that number.  This expectation is dangerous as it means, in the event of a liquidity crunch, people will behave not as people necessarily behave when there’s a sharp sell-off in a stock, but more along the lines of when their bank’s solvency is being called into question. Remember bank runs?  As bitcoin qua decentralized bank is running a fractional reserve with a chronic shortage of dollars, a shock therefore has the potential to not just drive the price of bitcoin down a little bit, but also lead to a major liquidity crunch and abject panic.  Credit comes to crypto  In my post, I wrote:  ""In the current environment, there are a number of ways such a shock could arise. To begin with, I seriously question the intermediaries’ and traders’ ability to top up their USD holdings quickly enough to catch up with their depositors’ and counterparties’ paper gains in bitcoin. There is also the possibility that, in the event of a correction or an enforcement action, a risk-averse bank to a major service provider withdraws either credit or banking services to that provider, compromising that service provider’s ability to convert BTC into dollars, provide margin lending, or even to hold fiat deposits at all.""  I had a hunch people were lending into the sector. I just didn't know the degree of alacrity with which this lending was taking place.  Fortunately, I was reading CoinDesk this afternoon and the reporting from the Consensus:Invest conference delivered:    ""Dan Matuszewski, the head of trading at Circle Internet Financial, said during a morning panel that there is a ‘real strong need’ for the ability to borrow in this market.      It would not only facilitate short positions but also provide working capital for trading desks to make markets, he said.    During his talk, [Max] Boonen of B2C2 acknowledged the irony of the situation given that bitcoin was born as a reaction to the 2008 credit crisis.    ‘Bitcoin enthusiasts really, really do not like credit,’ he said. But, he added, ‘for better or for worse, credit is an important part of a functioning and liquid financial market…’    …Even before the institutional money started flowing in, he noted, 'by necessity, credit did creep back into bitcoin and crypto markets in general,' with the major exchanges offering leverage to the early retail investors.""    So someone's lending directly into the market, we just don't know who, nor how much, nor where the liquidity for these lines of credit is ultimately coming from.  Leverage sneaks into the ecosystem in other ways, too; for example, Coinbase accepts credit cards, which is basically margin trading for grandmas, without collateral and with 20%+ rates of annual interest.  Given that rather a lot of people seem to be interested in buying bitcoin in this way, and that platform is racking up a few hundred thousand new users a week, there’s undoubtedly systemic risk building up there.  Then there’s Bitfinex and Tether, which I do not intend to discuss save to share this passage from The New York Times:  ""One persistent online critic, going by the screen name Bitfinex’ed, has written several very detailed essays on Medium arguing that Bitfinex appears to be creating Tether coins out of thin air and then using them to buy Bitcoin and push the price up.""  Long story short, these neophyte masters of the universe, too young (or too busy working as a dev in California) to know what a financial crisis feels like, and too dilettantish to find out, are successfully (a) getting buyers to leverage to buy coins, in some cases probably up to the hilt, or (b) convincing institutions to lend into this titanic, one-way, unhedged, $300 billion insanity trade, and trying to convince more of them to do so in greater amounts.  This could become serious  There are two not necessarily mutually exclusive ways people are responding to the Great Bubble of 2017: anticipatory schadenfreude on the one hand, abject horror on the other.  So far the response from mainstream finance has been the former, with The Wall Street Journal’s treatment of the subject being more or less a long-form joke.  But while there is something ineffably twee about a retiree trying to show how they’re hip and ""down with the kids"" thanks to their position in ""big coin,"" the fact that they are doing so raises very serious questions about bubble-driven risk (and attendant negative externalities to society) which merits closer attention. As of right now, the notional value of the cryptocurrency sector is roughly a third the size of Long-Term Capital Management at its peak.  Cryptocurrency is, admittedly, much smaller than the subprime bubble that popped a decade ago, which was roughly two orders of magnitude larger than bitcoin today. But bitcoin has shown, on several occasions, a persistent ability to defy detractors like me to grow an order of magnitude in less than 12 months; if it does so again, it will be three times larger than LTCM. LTCM on its own very nearly ruined the world in 1998.  If we aren’t careful, this is the kind of market where a financial institution can get in serious trouble extremely quickly (imagine the damage a character like Nick Leeson or Kweku Adoboli could have done trading Bitcoin contracts – which are coming soon to both the CME and, reportedly, Nasdaq).  We know that cryptocurrency marketing is writing checks the technology can’t cash; most of these systems are unusable as backbones for global finance. It is a matter of time before the punter on the street becomes as disillusioned as I, an irascible blockchain software entrepreneur, have become. It’s just that none of the newcomers know what they’re doing, and most of the old-timers who have figured this out are keeping their mouths shut out of self-interest.  Put another way, this is a disaster waiting to happen. Fortunately for us, 2008 is not ancient history, and the fact that Bitcoin is a classic, manic bubble is so transparently obvious that it should be impossible for thinking people to deal with it otherwise.

For once, please have the good sense to not load up on frothy bubble-driven financial assets, which you have done hitherto with such predictable regularity that the European Central Bank can model it and write a 52-page paper on the subject which is actually fun to read.  That way, when regulators finally bring this party to the bitter end it so richly deserves, the rest of the ship won’t go down with it.
