31549980,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=631573,1721948453,"Cardano Among Alts Likely To See Price Boosts, Santiment Says","On-chain analytics firm Santiment has revealed Cardano (ADA) is one of the altcoins that could likely see price jumps shortly. Cardano Among Altcoins That Are Being Heavily Shorted Right Now In a new post on X, Santiment has talked about the altcoins being shorted against on the derivatives market. The indicator of relevance here is the “Funding Rate,” which keeps track of the periodic fee that derivatives traders have to exchange with each other. When the value of this metric is positive, it means the long contract holders are currently paying a premium to the short investors to hold onto their positions. Therefore, this kind of trend implies the presence of a bullish majority sentiment in the market. Related Reading: Ethereum Spot ETF Hype: ETH Whale Activity 64% More Than BTC On the other hand, the negative indicator suggests the short holders outweigh the long ones right now, and as such, a bearish mentality is the dominant one in the sector. In the current topic, Santiment has referred to the Funding Rate specifically for the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, which is the largest platform by trading volume and should, thus, represent the trend on other large exchanges. Here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in this indicator for three altcoins over the past few months: As is visible in the above graph, all three of Cardano, Chiliz (CHZ), and Fantom (FTM) have seen their Binance Funding Rate stay inside the negative territory for the past five weeks, implying that investors have continuously been betting against a bullish outcome for them. Historically, such aggressive shorting against any asset has positively affected its price. This is because a liquidation squeeze is more likely to affect the dominant side of the market right now. A “liquidation squeeze” is an event where a sharp move in the price liquidates a large amount of contracts at once. These liquidations feed back into the move that caused them, thus amplifying it and kicking off a cascade of further liquidations. The chart shows that these three altcoins had also seen a similar level of shorting earlier in the year. What followed this bearish sentiment was a surge in their prices. Cardano saw a 10% surge, Chiliz 32%, and Fantom 49%. Related Reading: XRP Whales Go On $84 Million Buying Spree: Rally To Continue? Thus, going by this trend, it’s possible that short liquidations could once again happen for these altcoins and lead to a rally in their prices. ADA Price Cardano had broken past the $0.45 mark earlier, but the asset appears to have plunged since then, as its price is now trading around $0.39.

31546668,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=631538,1721943038,Cardano In The Spotlight: Why The $0.6 Level Is Important To ADA,"Cardano (ADA) is currently in a pronounced seven-day decline, which was exacerbated by a fresh descent below the $0.41 mark. This decline is part of a broader trend observed across many altcoins, which have reacted negatively to Ethereum’s significant drop in the last 24 hours. The decline represents a correction from a bullish run that began earlier in the month, during which ADA holders saw good gains. Consequently, this up-and-down movement has created some critical support and resistance levels for ADA, which will be crucial for investors to monitor in the coming days. The market sentiment has shifted considerably, and traders are now focusing on these key levels to gauge whether ADA might rebound or continue its downward trajectory. Important Price Levels For ADA At the time of writing, Cardano is trading at $0.3963 and has corrected by 11.6% from a peak of $0.4485 in the past 48 hours. Zooming out on a monthly timeframe shows that the cryptocurrency is merely correcting after a strong bullish run. During this run, ADA surged from $0.3213 to $0.4545 within a week, representing an impressive increase of 41.5%. However, the $0.45 level acted as a significant resistance point, causing ADA to reverse and enter a consolidation phase between $0.45 and $0.40, which was followed by a recent breakdown below the support. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Reach A New All-Time High? Crypto Analyst Reveals Why $90,000 Is Possible According to a technical analysis by a crypto analyst, this consolidation movement created a pattern similar to a small bullish flag, and a breakout above $0.45 to the upside could push ADA to $0.6. This suggests that ADA could soon bounce back up on a support level and resume its uptrend. On the other hand, analyzing ADA’s price movement suggests a break to the downside could push it to as low as a final key support level at $0.32 and cancel all of the gains it made earlier in the month. However, this is less likely to happen in the short term, as ADA now finds itself hovering around the $0.40 price level. What’s Next For Cardano? According to blockchain analytics firm Santiment, Cardano (ADA) is one of three cryptocurrencies with significantly negative funding rates on major exchanges. However, Santiment suggests that this may not be entirely detrimental. The heavily negative funding rates indicate a high probability of a price boost from the potential liquidation of short positions. Related Reading: Golden Cross Appears On XRP Price Chart, Factors That Could Drive A Fresh Rally Over the past five weeks, Cardano has been consistently shorted on exchanges. Should these shorts be liquidated by even a minor price increase, it could trigger a substantial price surge. This liquidation could act as a catalyst, propelling ADA’s value on an extended surge above $0.6. A potential catalyst for a price increase could be the highly anticipated Chang Hard Fork upgrade to the Cardano blockchain.

42417586,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZ9DR,1721942181,"Jersey City to Invest in Bitcoin ETFs, the Latest Pension to Dive Into Crypto","The municipal pension plan of Jersey City, New Jersey, will soon invest in bitcoin via exchange-traded funds, according to a Thursday social media post from Mayor Steven Fulop.  While it's not likely to be a gigantic sum, the decision is another symbolic win for cryptocurrency on the road toward wider adoption. The move follows a Wisconsin pension making a similar decision earlier this year.  Read more: As a Pension Embraces Bitcoin, Hope Grows for Cryptocurrency's Long-Term Prospects Even Among Conservative Pros  Fulop, who has been the mayor of Jersey City since 2013, took to X (formerly Twitter) to announce the forthcoming investment, writing: “Not my normal subject matter in a post but I’ll share anyway – the question on whether [c]rypto/Bitcoin is here to stay is largely over [and] crypto/Bitcoin won.”  Fulop, a Democrat, has thrown his hat into the ring for New Jersey’s 2025 gubernatorial election. Incumbent Governor Phil Murphy, also a Democrat, has already served two terms and is ineligible for reelection.  Fulop added that the city’s pension fund, the Employees Retirement System of Jersey City, is currently in the process of updating paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allocate a percentage of the fund to bitcoin {{BTC}} ETFs. According to Fulop’s tweet, the investment is expected to be completed “by end of the summer.”  Though Fulop did not specify exactly how much of the pension funds' assets under management will be allocated to bitcoin ETFs, he said it would be “similar” to the 2% allocation to bitcoin ETFs made by Wisconsin’s state pension fund earlier this year. Fulop did not specify which bitcoin ETF Jersey City was considering selecting for its investment.  “I’ve been a long time believer (through ups/downs) in crypto but [b]roadly, beyond crypto [I] do believe blockchain is amongst the most important new technology innovations since the internet,” Fulop said.  Interest in bitcoin from public pension funds is growing slowly but surely.  Wisconsin’s public pension plan – the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, which has roughly $156 billion in assets under management – is the biggest pension plan to dive into crypto so far, with a $160 million investment into spot bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. Some small pension funds like the Houston Firefighters’ Relief and Retirement Fund, which has about $5 billion in assets under management, have been invested in crypto for several years.  The pensions of Fairfax County, Virginia, also invested in crypto exposure through VanEck's New Finance Income Fund, which became a creditor to crypto firm Genesis as it filed for bankruptcy last year.  Outside of the U.S., public pension plans including Japan’s $1.4 trillion Government Pension Investment Fund, the largest pension plan in the world, put out a request for information on bitcoin investments earlier this year.  “I’m sure eventually it will be more common,” Fulop said of pension funds allocating to crypto in his tweet.

31543333,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=631613,1721937637,"Cardano Down 50% In 4 Months: Sellers Unrelenting, Best Time To Buy ADA?","Cardano has been under pressure and selling off in the past four months. From the ADAUSDT daily chart, it is evident that bears have been in control. After peaking in March, prices plunged by as much as 60% before finding support in mid-July. Since then, ADA has recovered slightly, but bears have not relentred, especially this week. So far, ADA is still 50% after the spike in March. This set of conditions could explain traders’ bearish stance on multiple perpetual trading platforms like Binance and OKX. The slip in ADA prices and the alignment of the trend to be bearish from March explain why the funding rate is negative and continues to increase. Time To Buy ADA Despite Extremely High Negative Funding Rates? Even so, not everyone is extremely bearish. Santiment analysts note that despite this state of affairs, ADA prices could, if anything, recover unexpectedly. They explained that the recent spike in negative funding rates, pointing to heightened selling activity, could offer a contrarian opportunity for aggressive traders. Related Reading: End Of The Road? Shiba Inu’s Shibarium Sees Massive 80.3% Crash In Active Accounts Historically, Santiment analysts explained that prices tend to recover sharply in the sessions ahead whenever an asset is extremely sold, as is the case with ADA. Rapidly expanding prices tend to trigger a short squeeze, forcing sellers to buy at a higher price and fanning the uptrend. Nonetheless, this is not always the case, and this contrarian strategy should be taken cautiously. When a given asset is perceived as “extremely oversold,” prices can often dip even as analysts expect a recovery. This may mean traders are unconvinced that the asset has what it takes to recover in the wave of intense selling pressure. In this case, traders have to stay safe and align with the primary trend—bearish. Cardano Whales Staying Away Ahead Of The Chang Hard Fork So far, parallel data from IntoTheBlock points to waning investor confidence. According to data, there has been a drop in whale inflow, a dent to the expected optimism. Still, this can be attributed to portfolio rebalancing that might impact inflows, among other factors. It remains to be seen how ADA will perform in the coming days. The Cardano development team is preparing for the Chang hard fork, which is set to conclude by the end of July.

42417588,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZ9GX,1721937317,VanEck Sees Bitcoin Hitting $2.9M by 2050 – but a Lot Has to Happen First,"By 2050, bitcoin may settle 10% of international trade and 5% of local trade gain with central banks' holding it as a reserve asset, asset manager VanEck said in a report.  Bitcoin layer-2 networks will play a key role to overcome scaling issues and allow BTC to be used as a medium of exchange, the firm said.  There are risks for bitcoin's growth, including rising power demand, concerted government crackdowns and competition with other digital assets, the report said.  Asset manager VanEck, an issuer of spot bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} ETFs, says that BTC's price may reach $2.9 million by 2050 – assuming some pretty high hurdles are cleared.  Under VanEck's assumptions in a Wednesday report, bitcoin would become an essential part of the international monetary system in the next decades as rising geopolitical tensions and ballooning debt servicing costs erode the current system.  ""As we look at the world right now, we see enormous economic imbalances, rising distrust in existing institutions and continued deglobalization,"" Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at Van Eck and one of the report's authors, said in a Wednesday interview on CNBC.  ""We think many of these distortions stem from ... a massive misallocation of capital since the global financial crisis as G7 governments have abused the printing press, spending borrowed money on impossible goals,"" Sigel explained.  ""Bitcoin ... is the ultimate hedge against this rising fiscal recklessness,"" Sigel said.  In the report's base case scenario, BTC would become a key medium of exchange in local and global trade, representing 10% of international trade settlement and 5% of GDP.  Meanwhile, it would also gain as a global reserve asset at the expense of the four largest foreign reserve currencies – the U.S. dollar, euro, British pound and Japanese yen – reaching a 2.5% weight in international currency reserves.  If things play out as VanEck envisions, bitcoin's price will increase in value by 44 times, gaining 16% annually from its current price of just below $65,000. Its market capitalization would soar to $61 trillion.  The proliferation of layer-2 networks will play a key role in overcoming the Bitcoin blockchain's bottlenecks and scaling issues that prevent BTC from being a useful medium of exchange, the report said. The sector could collectively be worth $7.6 trillion by 2050, applying the same valuation framework as for Ethereum layer 2s.  VanEck also warned about potential risks ahead that could stifle bitcoin's expansion.  Increasing energy demand by miners will require innovation, while revenue from processing transactions has to grow dramatically to replace diminishing mining rewards (which get cut in half every four years via halvings) to incentivize miners to sustain the network. Concerted efforts by governments around the world to restrict or outlaw bitcoin are also a threat.  Further risks highlighted in the report include competition from other cryptocurrencies and large financial institutions exerting too much control.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/25/vaneck-sees-bitcoin-hitting-29m-by-2050-but-a-lot-has-to-happen-first,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dbaaf4ee09d542d601779598bea948f38611ee01-1184x678.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417571,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZ937,1721933497,How Kamala Harris Could Usher in a Clean Slate for Crypto Regulation,"What a difference a week makes. On Thursday, July 18, Donald Trump formally accepted the GOP nomination as its candidate for the 2024 presidential election at the Republican National Convention, just days after he survived an assassination attempt. On Sunday, July 21, at 1:46 pm ET, as President Biden announced his decision not to seek re-election, everything changed. The political landscape became as volatile as a bitcoin price chart.  With an endorsement from Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris has quickly become the presumptive nominee for Democrats, raising small-dollar donations at a pace reminiscent of Barack Obama’s insurgent 2008 presidential campaign. However, the enthusiasm stops at the door of a well-funded crypto industry that has taken an offensive position to protect itself from a hostile regulatory environment and driven it to coalesce around a single-issue voting block set to cast its votes for the GOP nominee.  Almost as soon as the Biden news broke, I began to see social media posts from the crypto community about what a Harris administration’s stance on crypto would be. Would she continue a regulation-by-enforcement and hostile policy position, or embrace the opportunity to reimagine crypto policy with a view toward embracing the new economy? Or set off in a new direction?  Then, I saw a flurry of social media musings that Vice President Harris is considering attending the Bitcoin 2024 Conference, taking place from July 25 to July 27 in Nashville, Tennessee. Trump, Michael Saylor, and Elon Musk are also expected to appear, making it a significant event with high stakes.  On Thursday, July 24, conference organizer and Bitcoin Magazine’s CEO David Bailey shared on X that VP Harris declined to attend. It seemed highly unlikely that she would be able to attend given that scheduling a senior Federal official takes longer than 48 hours. The process involves coordination, review and vetting by multiple offices and the requisite approvals.  Nonetheless, even the consideration is a win. With the crypto industry’s voice on the Harris campaign’s radar, Harris now has an opportunity to address a deeply concerned and invested group of bitcoiners and begin the reparative work of bridge-building to counter the anti-crypto aggression and regulation-by-enforcement initiatives deployed by the current administration.  The Biden Administration’s Anti-Crypto Policy  Under Biden, cryptocurrency regulation has been marked by a confusing and confounding enforcement-heavy approach, largely influenced by Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). Known for her skepticism of the crypto industry, Warren has advocated for strict regulatory measures to protect consumers and maintain financial stability. Her influence is evident in the administration's ""Chokepoint 2.0"" strategy and in the stance of her ally SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, as well as prudential regulators who restricted the crypto industry’s access to traditional banking services, effectively “de-banking” the sector.  Fueled by misinformation and a kernel of truth, Warren’s approach has focused on addressing the risks associated with cryptocurrencies, including fraud, money laundering, and terrorism financing without right-sizing the discussions to balance risks with the considerable economic justice opportunities and separate fact from fiction.  A Technological Moderate  Vice President Harris's prior approach to technology regulation is characterized by a more moderate tone compared to the current administration’s approach. Throughout her career, she has forged strong relationships with major technology companies such as Facebook and Google. She has been a notable presence at their headquarters and has enlisted employees and allies from these companies to advise her campaign on tech policy. Her approach emphasizes finding a balance between regulation and allowing technological advancement. A strategic policy shift to incorporate past openness to innovation coupled with her campaign’s focus on economic empowerment of the middle class may create an opportunity for a both/and approach that optimizes investor and consumer protections with the support of robust development of the Web3 economy on the rails of blockchain and powered by cryptographically secured digital assets.  But what signals that she would be open to a pivot on crypto policy? For one, billionaire Mark Cuban noted on X this week that Harris’ team has been asking numerous crypto-related questions. That, added to her pro-innovation record and entertaining discussions of appearing at Bitcoin 2024 all bode well for a different approach in a Harris Administration.  Ten Policy Shifts for a New Era  As the Democratic presidential nominee, Harris has the unique opportunity to chart a new course for crypto policy, one I am calling ""New Economy 2025,"" which balances sensible and transparent regulation with robust innovation for investors, consumers and businesses alike. This approach would ensure that the U.S. remains a leader in the digital asset economy while promoting financial inclusion and protecting consumer interests.  To that end, here are ten policy shifts that could redefine the Democratic party’s stance on digital assets and foster a more inclusive financial ecosystem under a Harris presidency:  Amend Securities Laws for Clarity and Innovation  What: Revise existing securities laws to clarify the distinction between a security and a commodity in the context of cryptocurrencies. I advocated strongly for thisin my testimony before the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology & Inclusion.  How: Ensure relevant and specific agencies are designated to regulate the crypto industry, preventing overly broad or conflicting interpretations that could hinder market growth and stifle innovation.  Update Banking Regulations for Crypto Integration  What: Modify the Bank Secrecy Act and other banking regulations to create clear guidelines for banks dealing with cryptocurrency businesses.  How: Promote a crypto-friendly banking environment, enabling financial institutions to engage with the crypto sector confidently, reducing perceived and actual risks, and fostering greater integration and accessibility. Additionally, consider the legislative and regulatory shifts needed to add bitcoin reserves as part of the Central Bank’s reserve portfolio.  Reform Tax Policies to Support the Digital Economy  What: Reform tax policies to address the unique aspects of digital assets, providing clear guidelines on the taxation of crypto transactions and holdings.  How: Create a framework for individuals and businesses to comply with tax obligations while participating in the digital economy safely and legally, ensuring fair participation across all economic income levels.  Enhance Consumer Protection Laws  What: Strengthen consumer protection laws specific to the crypto market, ensuring transparent disclosures and protections against fraud.  How: Implement measures to provide clear recourse for victims, building consumer trust and ensuring a safer crypto market, particularly protecting vulnerable populations.  Develop Robust Privacy Laws for Individual Data Protection  What: Formulate strong privacy laws to safeguard individual data in blockchain and digital identity systems.  How: Promote privacy-friendly digital identities and ensure crypto transactions respect individual privacy rights, protecting marginalized communities from exploitation.  Integrate Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Education  What: Incorporate cryptocurrency and blockchain education into national education standards, including financial literacy programs.  How: Equip individuals with the knowledge needed to navigate the digital economy confidently and responsibly through school curriculums and adult education programs, ensuring opportunities for all demographics.  Allocate Federal Funds for Blockchain R&D  What: Allocate funding to support research and development in blockchain technology.  How: Encourage innovation, create jobs, and maintain the U.S.'s competitive edge in the global digital economy by investing in R&D, particularly benefiting underserved communities through job creation and economic inclusion.  Promote DeFi Platforms for Financial Inclusion  What: Encourage the development and adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to offer financial services without traditional intermediaries.  How: Increase access to financial services for underserved communities, promoting financial inclusion and bridging the wealth gap.  Form Public-Private Partnerships for Public Good  What: Establish partnerships between government agencies and private blockchain companies for public infrastructure projects.  How: Develop digital identity systems and transparent supply chains leveraging blockchain technology, improving public services and economic opportunities for all. Also, consider regulatory sandboxes to further promote and support innovation in collaboration with government stakeholders to learn so they can effectively lead.  Harmonize International Crypto Regulations  What: Position the U.S. as a global leader in crypto regulation by collaborating with international bodies.  How: Develop harmonized regulations to ensure the U.S. plays a central role in shaping the future of the global digital economy, promoting stability and fostering cross-border innovation.  By implementing these initiatives, the Harris administration can create a regulatory environment that not only protects investors and fosters innovation but also promotes economic justice and opportunity for all, ensuring the U.S. remains at the forefront of the digital asset economy.  ""New Economy 2025"" vision would emphasize the transformative potential of blockchain and cryptocurrency, harnessing technology to create a more equitable and inclusive financial system that ushers in increase investment opportunities, job creation and economic growth, consumer, investor and industry protection from fraud and scams, tax simplification, financial inclusion and economic justice, and industry stability and confidence.  Crypto is political; not partisan. At least it shouldn’t be. Harris’s track record of championing technological advancement and protecting privacy rights positions her uniquely to harness the transformative potential of blockchain and cryptocurrency.  As we move forward, advocating for regulatory clarity, consumer protections, financial literacy, and global collaboration is essential to solidify the U.S. as a leader in the digital asset economy. By embracing this reimagined approach, we can truly democratize access to financial opportunities, empower marginalized communities, and uphold the values of freedom and privacy, paving the way for a prosperous and inclusive New Economy 2025.

Renowned crypto educator Common Sense Crypto has lately underlined the token’s ability to reach triple digits despite some doubts from some quarters. Related Reading: Will PEPE Climb 30% This Week? This Analyst Thinks So This positive view is based mostly on the ambitious projection of Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse for the larger crypto industry. Garlinghouse projected a $5 trillion market valuation for the crypto industry earlier this year—a number much beyond the $2.4 trillion market cap right now. Garlinghouse claims that in a strong bull market this estimate is not only realistic but also a cautious one. Making use of Garlinghouse’s conviction, Common Sense Crypto sees XRP as a main contender for significant price rise. For all the naysayers out there that don’t think $xrp can pull a 3 digit run let’s look at some ways it can happen: 1. Brad Garlinghouse expects $5 trillion to flow into this space by end of year 2024 & said that’s conservative. 2. Archax plans to bring $30 – $50 trillion in… pic.twitter.com/Lwi9cHYirY — Common Sense Crypto (@TheCSCrypto) July 23, 2024 Institutional Interest Archax, a well-known UK-based bitcoin exchange with big ideas for the XRP Ledger, fuels the positive story. Recently, CEO Graham Rodford presented a bold plan using XRP’s blockchain to oversee $50 trillion in tokenized assets. Made during Ripple’s Swell conference, this narrative emphasizes XRP’s transformative power in the financial industry. Common Sense Crypto said that Archax is only one of numerous partners helping XRP’s upward trajectory to be seen. Attracting institutional investors eager to profit on the token’s potential depends critically on the outcome of Ripple’s protracted legal struggle. Ripple’s lawsuit is crucial for XRP’s institutional investor appeal. Legal procedures have defined the cryptocurrency regulatory landscape, specifically XRP’s security status. A major verdict said that XRP sales to institutional investors are securities, while sales on public exchanges are not, allowing individual investors to trade more freely without extensive regulatory compliance. XRP Price Projections And Supply Dynamics XRP, which is currently trading at $0.62, has exhibited little change over the previous day—0.53%. Short-term projections show significant volatility; the token is predicted to trade 20.12% below its anticipated price during the next month. Related Reading: Ethereum Name Service (ENS) 153% Rally ‘Underway’, Analyst Says The medium-term picture is bright, though; a predicted 16.34% rise over the following three months and an astounding 170% expansion expected within six months, data from CoinCheckup shows. Looking ahead, a one-year estimate shows a possible 98% increase, signifying strong long-term development prospects. XRP would need a market cap between $5 and $10 trillion if it were to reach the illusive $100 mark—an ambitious target that recognizes the token’s ongoing challenges. The analyst is cautiously hopeful in spite of these obstacles, pushing investors to weigh the token’s potential while keeping abreast of the related risks.

42417580,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZ98H,1721930030,"Staking in Ethereum ETFs Might Be a Question of When, Not If","Spot ether exchange-traded funds successfully debuted in the U.S. on Tuesday, but regulators didn't let the ETFs generate income for investors by staking their ETH.  The absence represents a disadvantage over directly holding the cryptocurrency, but issuers are hopeful regulators will eventually allow staking.  Eight newly approved spot ether {{ETH}} exchange-traded funds got off to a busy start following their debut this week, despite lacking a key feature of Ethereum's native token: staking income.  While the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which has existed in non-ETF form for years but just converted into an ETF, has seen about $811 million of outflows, new products from the likes of BlackRock saw almost $800 million deposited in the first two days. Issuers say they're pleased.  This early success wasn't a given, especially after several issuers announced that they would not stake ether for yield, which they had initially planned to do in earlier filings. This was likely due to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission telling them to remove the feature as staking could potentially violate federal securities laws as it constitutes unregistered securities offerings, as the SEC had previously argued in other cases.  With a new administration taking office in January, things could change quickly and issuers remain hopeful that the feature could eventually become part of the products.  That being said, it is not currently ""an active discussion,"" Rob Mitchnick, head of digital assets for BlackRock, said in an interview with CoinDesk. He added that the SEC made its view on that clear.  BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, did not initially apply to be able to stake in their application but others, including Fidelity and Franklin Templeton, did.  ""I certainly would hope that as an industry, we're going to be able to help to educate and provide perspective on how it is that we can bring staking capabilities to investors in these products,"" said Cynthia Lo Bessette, head of digital asset management at Fidelity. ""Staking is a critical component of the Ethereum ecosystem as it is the activity that secures the ecosystem and so, therefore, it's an important part of the investment experience and being able to invest in your ether.""  Former President Donald Trump seems to have won over the hearts of many leaders in the crypto industry and is their favored choice in this year's election given his recent endorsement of the space.  ""I believe staking within spot ether ETFs is a matter of when, not if,"" said Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store. ""That said, there is no question that politics are intertwined with the timing of the 'when.'""  He added: ""Indications are that a Trump administration would be much more crypto-friendly, which could certainly accelerate the timeline of when staking might be allowed. Otherwise, ETF issuers could be left waiting on a comprehensive crypto regulatory framework to be put in place, which would likely take significantly longer.""  For Franklin Templeton, who, like Fidelity, was keen on making staking a part of the ETFs, starting without that feature seemed natural and made the overall process of getting the product approved easier.  ""The easier path or path of least resistance was clearly to do it as an unstaked version,"" said Christopher Jensen, director of digital asset research for Franklin Templeton's Digital Asset Investment Strategies Group. ""It just works better, it's simpler, it's easier, and the execution risk was lower, so I think it's very natural that that's where we started.""  If staking will be part of the ETFs in the future, it doesn't seem to be up to the asset managers, but is a question of whether the regulatory landscape in the future will be open to it.  ""I think it's very tied into the regulatory clarity that we think will happen over time of whether that will or won't happen,"" said David Mann, head of ETF product & capital markets for Franklin. ""This is the framework we're dealing with today and if it evolves, we'll be ready to evolve with it.""",NEUTRAL,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/news-analysis/2024/07/25/staking-in-ether-etfs-is-a-question-of-when-not-if-and-issuers-remain-hopeful,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5be80b30f22359c793cfd0f67f7dbf3a7879a940-1496x842.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

31536937,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=631537,1721926836,Ethereum Whales Rapidly Accumulate ETH Amid Price Decline,"Ethereum whales have been busy in the market, as on-chain data shows that these investors have been heavily accumulating the second-largest crypto token by market cap. This comes amid a price decline in ETH’s price, with history suggesting that the crypto token might suffer more price declines in the short term. Whales Accumulate More ETH Data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shows that Ethereum Whales bought 297,670 ETH ($1 billion) on July 24. The previous day, these whales also bought almost 400,000 ETH. Further data shows an increase of over 28% in the inflows into these whales’ addresses in the last seven days. Related Reading: Machine Learning Algorithm Predicts Shiba Inu Price Will Rise 119% In 5 Days The decline in outflows from these addresses further highlights these investors’ bullish sentiment towards Ethereum despite its underperformance. Outflows from these accounts have declined by over 14% in the last seven days and down by over 16% in the last 30 days. The large holders’ netflow metric on IntoTheBlock also highlights this wave of accumulation among Ethereum whales, as net flows have increased by over 313%. This means that these investors are heavily accumulating rather than opting to sell their ETH holdings. On-chain analytics platform Santiment noted that this significant increase in ETH’s whale activity is due to the Spot Ethereum ETFs, which began trading on July 23. The platform made this observation while revealing that since July 17, the amount of ETH transfers has exceeded over $100,000 in value, which is over 64% higher than the number of BTC transfers and over 126% higher than the USDT transfers on the Ethereum network. The Spot Ethereum ETFs had undoubtedly presented a bullish outlook for Ethereum even before they launched, as crypto analysts like RLinda predicted that ETH could rise to $4,000 thanks to these funds. As such, it is no surprise that Ethereum whales continue to accumulate the crypto token in anticipation of higher prices from ETH. The Spot Ethereum ETFs Launch Might Be A Headwind At First The Spot Ethereum ETFs were projected to be the catalyst that would spark a massive rally in ETH’s price, and that is likely to happen at some point. However, history suggests these funds may act as a headwind for Ethereum at first, similar to the fate that Bitcoin suffered immediately after the Spot Bitcoin ETFs launched earlier this year. Related Reading: Analyst Says Solana Price Will Surge 1,000% To $1,800, Here’s When Bitcoin experienced significant price declines, largely thanks to the outflows from Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). A similar situation is already playing out for ETH with Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE). Interestingly, Grayscale’s ETHE experienced a net outflow of $484.1 million on day 1 of trading, much larger than the net outflows GBTC experienced on day 1, and GBTC is bigger. Considering this, Ethereum could face significant selling pressure from Grayscale’s ETHE. Data from Farside Investors shows that the Spot Ethereum ETF experienced a net outflow of $326.9 million on July 24 (day 2), likely just the start of the massive outflows that could eventually pour out from the fund.

42417575,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZ95B,1721923424,$GREED 2.0: A New Lesson in Crypto Avarice That Might Also Enrich the People It Dupes,"Last year, a social experiment called $GREED aimed to teach crypto enthusiasts a lesson, tricking them into tweeting an embarrassing message.  The project is back. This time, there's real money involved – a lot of it.  ""In Sh*tcoin Season, any pointless cryptocurrency with a Twitter account can enchant thousands of traders into playing memecoin musical chairs. Throwing money at the wall and reason out the window, they let greed get the best of them. Sometimes literally.""  That is how I started my May 2023 story about $GREED, a social experiment that duped crypto traders hoping to score a quick buck into embarrassing themselves on Twitter (now X). It was a lesson in good judgment disguised as a money-making opportunity.  The story's moral did not stick. In less than a year, speculators' memecoin greed prompted them to once again trade their good judgment for too-good-to-be-true returns. Presale scammers pitching exclusive memecoins earlier this year stole $122 million from wannabe get-rich-quick degens, according to on-chain sleuth ZackXBT.  It was a devolution of the zero-sum casino games that give crypto a shady reputation. Forget about exchange tokens that traders believe have value, or well-known memecoins that have graduated from pure joke to, well, billion-dollar jokes like DOGE or SHIB. These presale tokens were literal scams. But people were willing to suspend their disbelief to get in early.  ""This is so stupid, people are just going to get rugged,"" $GREED's creator, who goes by Voshy, said in an interview. ""How do you teach these people a lesson?""  He decided to recreate his social experiment with a twist. Last time, his nonexistent $GREED token made a mockery of its ""victims"" without costing them any capital: He duped them into giving him access to their Twitter accounts, letting him shame them by posting an embarrassing tweet about their succumbing to their own greed.  This time, like last, $GREED would not cost its participants anything, nor would there be a token at all. Instead it would be the lure for a surprisingly lucrative staking freeze. $GREED's unwitting participants would lock their own SOL in a staking account, safe from presale predators. While their money was working for them, it would also work for $GREED: an education initiative that Voshy hopes will teach the entire space a lesson.  The plan  For part two of $GREED, Voshy started by tweeting vague promises of what seemed like an upcoming airdrop of a GREED token. It caught on. Just like in 2023, crypto traders started angling for a token they knew nothing about.  Soon, Voshy upped the ante with a website with wallet-connection capabilities. People could now seemingly commit their SOL to GREED. But for what? The website didn't say it was conducting a presale. It made no promises about what it was for, or what people would get. Details didn't matter; in the first hour, 1,527 wallets pledged 6,220 SOL (currently worth about $1 million).  That's where Voshy's experiment diverged from the scammy sh*tcoin presales. Instead of taking people's money in exchange for a token (or in exchange for nothing, as scammers do), Voshy's website had prompted them to stake their SOL tokens to a Solana validator. When they signed the transaction, they locked their tokens to this validator for six months, until mid-September.  ""Locking it for three days, nobody would care. We wanted the people to notice, we wanted the people to feel something, to remember it just like last $GREED,"" Voshy said.  Last year's $GREED experiment taught its unwitting participants to be ""very careful"" about giving out access to their social media accounts lest they be embarrassed again, the prankster said. With this year's $GREED, ""we wanted to achieve that people don't just send their assets out.""  Those who locked their money in $GREED aren't completely stranded. They can get their tokens out by creating a governance proposal and then convincing 15 other $GREED participants to vote for their assets' release. A couple hundred of the GREEDy have attempted to lobby their way back to liquidity, with mixed success.  ""Vote for me if you also hate presale meta and will never send to anyone again,"" wrote one participant who failed to get their SOL unlocked through a vote last month.  Unlikely moneymaker  One of the benefits of duping people to stake their SOL during presale scam season is, well, protecting their SOL from presale thieves. But another lucrative benefit: staking yield. Staked SOL earns more SOL.  For those who don't get their money out in votes, they'll have the option to withdraw come Solana's Breakpoint conference in September. At that point, the lock freeze will thaw and with it a pile of extra tokens from $GREED's partner protocols: Samoyed memecoin, the Marms NFT collection, Texture, Famous Fox Federation, Racket and Cyberfrogs. They all pitched in an assortment of tokens and NFTs that will go to those who leave their money in $GREED to the end.  ""Everybody who put their SOL in there is going to get more"" than they had if GREED was actually a token, Voshy said. He mused: A good chunk would have likely lost their SOL tokens to some other scam if their money wasn't stuck. Instead of losing it, they're earning more through staking at an annualized rate near 8%.  Most validators take a commission on the earnings generated by its staked assets, but the $GREED validator, run by Triton, doesn't, Voshy said. All of its staking yield goes to the frozen stakers, the ones who locked their SOL up for months.  $GREED academy  Voshy's $GREED experiment is attempting to teach the whole space a lesson. Though the validator at the heart of it doesn't take a commission, it does collect tens of thousands of dollars in SOL every month from transaction tips. All that money will go toward education initiatives, according to Voshy.  ""Mostly we want to empower people in the ecosystem to educate others,"" Voshy said. He spat out a few ideas: dapps that incentivize learning about crypto, TikToks and YouTube videos, that kind of thing.  ""It's going to be fully crypto education and quite Solana-focused,"" he said.  Altruism turned $GREED's validator into an unlikely success story. Though a couple thousand SOL were staked before the lockup ""gotcha"" was widely known, a tsunami of SOL poured in after word got out. The $GREED validator currently has nearly 900,000 SOL tokens – a hoard worth roughly $150 million. More continues to pour in ahead of an end-of-July deadline, he said.",NEGATIVE,DOGE | SHIB | SOL,DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL | AIRDROP,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/07/25/greed-20-a-new-lesson-in-crypto-avarice-that-might-also-enrich-the-people-it-dupes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bbf228e1cb8b1a192f9fc619aa7c2c549e9fade3-1684x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42417577,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZ99J,1721923396,Bitcoin Miners Have Considerable Upside From Their Power Portfolios: Bernstein,"Bernstein said bitcoin miners have upside from the power portfolios they control.  Miners that focus on an active power strategy and efficiency are more likely to see a valuation rerating, the report said.  Large miners remain focused on bitcoin production and Riot Platforms, CleanSpark and Iren are best positioned to grow market share, the broker said.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} miners have significant potential upside from the power portfolios that they control, broker Bernstein said in a research report on Wednesday.  “We believe bitcoin miners by focusing on an active power strategy and pushing the frontiers of power efficiency can make a stronger case for a valuation re-rating,” analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote.  Investors can profit by valuing the companies as “efficient power shells with data center capabilities,” as opposed to just bitcoin mining operations, the report said. Bernstein noted that miners trade at around a 90% discount to general data center valuations.  Read more: Bitcoin Miner Marathon Buys $100M BTC, Will Once Again Adopt 'Full HODL' Strategy  The bitcoin mining sector has rerated in recent months after Core Scientific (CORZ) inked a 12-year artificial intelligence (AI) deal with cloud computing firm CoreWeave. The market is pricing in the potential AI and high-performance computing (HPC) opportunity and the upside stemming from alternative and more accretive use cases for bitcoin mining sites.  Large miners remain focused on growing bitcoin production and their respective hashrates, the broker noted, and Riot Platforms (RIOT), CleanSpark (CLSK) and Iren (IREN) are best positioned to expand market share.  There is also headroom in power efficiency and uptime, the note said, and miners can benefit from extracting more hashrate from their existing portfolios by upgrading their hardware to the latest generations of ASICs. The hashrate, a measure of computing power, is a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty.  Iren, which used to be known as Iris Energy, and CleanSpark rate well in terms of power efficiency and uptime, and Core Scientific ranks highly with regards to data center uptime, Bernstein said. Riot’s efficiency should improve as it energizes its large power sites and Marathon Digital’s (MARA) efficiency should recover as it builds out its self-mining portfolio.  “Customization and innovation in mining systems and software can further boost efficiency,” the note said.  The broker has an outperform rating on CleanSpark, Core Scientific, Iren and Riot Platforms, and a market perform rating on Marathon Digital.

According to the analysis, Dogecoin appears to be following a consistent pattern where it consolidates within a descending triangle, followed by significant rallies of 140% to 230%. This is typically succeeded by retracements ranging from 56% to 60%, setting the stage for a bull run. “I haven’t sold one single DOGE. I’ve just been buying! Dogecoin is playing the same pattern we’ve seen before. It consolidates in a descending triangle, sees a 140% to 230% rally, and retraces by 56% to 60% before entering a bull run. So now we just wait!!!” Martinez said via X. The chart shared by the crypto analyst illustrates a recurring theme in Dogecoin’s trading history. In 2016, DOGE price successfully broke out of a descending triangle pattern, leading to a substantial rally of 229.58%, followed by a significant retracement of 60.44%. This pullback set the stage for the primary bull run surge witnessed in 2017. Similarly, in 2020, Dogecoin experienced a 138% rise post a breakout from another descending triangle pattern, only to undergo a 59.86% decline subsequently. Nevertheless, this decline cleared the way for yet another remarkable price surge in 2021. The second wave of price surges for Dogecoin has historically been substantial. Over a four-month period from September 2017 to January 2018, DOGE experienced a near meteoric rise of almost 2,900%, climbing from $0.0007 to $0.0194, following a retracement of up to 60%, as Martinez noted. In the last cycle, from February 2021 to May 2021, Dogecoin rallied approximately 1,700%, escalating from $0.041 to its all-time high of $0.7316. A rally akin to the 2017-2018 surge —about 2,900%—-could potentially elevate DOGE’s price to around $4 from its current level. Meanwhile, a rally similar to the 2021 increase—about 1,700%—would approximately push DOGE’s price to $2.4. Notably, Martinez’s chart suggests he anticipates a clear break above the $2 mark, although no exact price target has been specified. Already in March this year, Martinez wrote via X: “I feel my fellow degens have been distracted with the new shiny memecoins, but Dogecoin remains the most important altcoin in this sector. From a technical perspective, DOGE seems to mirror the 2018-2021 pattern. If so, DOGE could be at the very beginning of a massive parabolic bull run!” At the time, Martinez shared a chart which showed that he expects DOGE to exceed $11 in this bull run. Yesterday, Martinez offered a short-term price forecast for DOGE, stating via X: “It looks like Dogecoin broke out of a wedge, which suggests an upside target of 44%!” According to the chart presented by the crypto analyst, the next key short-term resistance levels for DOGE are positioned at $0.14479, $0.1613, and $0.1844.

During that period, however, the total value locked (TVL) on EigenLayer – a protocol that links restaking protocols – slumped by $2.28 billion to $15.1 billion. Restaking protocols like Renzo and Kelp have lost 45% and 22% of their TVL, respectively, data from DefiLlama shows.

For others, the yield is too low when compared with specific yield-generation protocols like Ethena. Renzo offers an annual yield of 3.43%; Ethena offers more than 10%.  Restaking is a strategy that investors use to secure an additional yield on ETH that is already staked on the main Ethereum blockchain.

Notably, Jito's code would allow users to secure AVSs using whatever crypto asset they choose.  Jito's brand of restaking differs from the version popularized by EigenLayer on the Ethereum network, which restricts collateral to ETH, certain ETH derivatives and the platform's native EIGEN tokens.  ""The flexibility and customization allowed in this architecture will be especially useful for the most important customer of these systems - the AVSs,"" said Lucas Bruder, a contributor at Jito Network.

Jito's code release puts it in the lead, though people familiar with the project told CoinDesk that it had not implemented the code on the mainnet. That's to come later this year.

Have you ever considered how to evaluate crypto projects and what criteria to consider? In today’s issue, Matthew Burgoyne, partner at law firm Osler Hoskin & Harcourt LLP, provides a guide for investment advisors to evaluate crypto projects.  In Ask an Expert, David Ben Kay, president at Function X, answers questions advisors can consider when evaluating investments.  –S.M.  As exclusive sponsors for this week's Crypto for Advisors newsletter, we'd like to congratulate Grayscale for launching their new Ethereum ETF. The ticker is simply ETH - we see what you did there!  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  How to Evaluate Crypto Projects: A Guide for Investment Advisors  As the momentum of the crypto and blockchain industry continues to grow, securities advisors are undoubtedly facing a greater number of questions from clients about specific crypto assets and the projects that underlie them. Evaluating these projects requires a thorough understanding of several crucial factors to ensure informed investment decisions. The following sections highlight areas for advisors to consider when evaluating the nature and legitimacy of any crypto project and corresponding crypto asset:  Project founder due diligence  Investigate the backgrounds of project founders, including their professional history, previous projects and industry reputation. Look for verifiable expertise and be alert for potential fraud. Red flags include newly created social media profiles and anonymous teams.  Reviewing and critically analyzing tokenomics  Tokenomics refers to the economic model of the token, including its supply, distribution, and utility within the project. Key aspects to analyze include:  Supply and distribution: Understand the total supply of tokens and how they are distributed among stakeholders. Pay attention to the allocation for founders, team members, advisors, and investors. A well-balanced distribution minimizes the risk of market manipulation.  Utility: Evaluate the practical use of the token within the project. Tokens should have a clear purpose, such as facilitating transactions, accessing services, or incentivizing participation. Projects with vague or unnecessary token usage should be approached with caution.  Inflation and deflation mechanisms: Assess whether the project has mechanisms to control token supply, such as token burns (reducing supply). Understanding these mechanisms helps in evaluating long-term value stability.  Evaluating the business plan  A realistic and sound business plan is essential for the viability of any token project. In the crypto industry, a business plan is commonly presented within a white paper, which is a foundational document that outlines the project’s vision, the nature and use of blockchain technology and implementation strategy. Key elements to review include:  Necessity of the token: Determine why a token is essential for the project. The token should solve a specific problem or enhance the functionality of the project, not just serve as a fundraising tool.  Market need and competition: Analyze the market demand for the project’s solution and identify its competitors. As is the case in the traditional finance (“TradFi”) world, a unique value proposition and a well-defined market niche are indicators of potential success.  Revenue model: It is essential to understand how the project plans to generate revenue. Look for sustainable and scalable revenue streams that are realistically achievable within the given market conditions.  Risk factors  Identifying potential risks is crucial in evaluating token projects. Common risk factors include:  Technical risks: Assess the likelihood of technical failures or vulnerabilities; multiple blockchain and software code audits conducted by reputable third parties are positive signs and lessens the likelihood of hacking incidents, which can lead to significant loss for consumers.  Liquidity risks: The liquidity for certain tokens can be heavily concentrated on a few crypto asset trading platforms or liquidity pools. When a significant portion of tokens is held within only a few of these venues, buying or selling them efficiently may become challenging, especially during periods of high trading volume  Risk from competitors: Many tokens face significant competition from other blockchain platforms that offer similar or enhanced functionalities. When analyzing a crypto project, consider whether there are high gas/transaction fees or network congestion associated with the blockchain. There may be competing projects and tokens which offer lower transaction costs and faster processing times, which could attract software developers and users away from the project under review.  Regulatory considerations  Evaluate whether the issuance of the token triggers regulatory requirements, such as anti-money laundering (AML) laws or securities laws; many new projects trigger one or both areas of law, while some older, well-established projects that are sufficiently decentralized do not trigger these laws. It is essential to verify whether the project founders have obtained legal advice and if sales are restricted in major markets like the U.S. and the UK. Such restrictions could indicate an attempt to circumvent securities regulators in those countries, suggesting that the token sale may involve the sale of securities or derivatives.  Conclusion  Evaluating token projects requires a comprehensive approach, considering the credibility of the founders, the economic model of the token, the quality and viability of the business plan, potential risks and regulatory compliance. By thoroughly analyzing these factors, investment advisors can provide informed guidance to their clients, helping them navigate the complex and evolving landscape of crypto assets.  - Matthew Burgoyne, Partner, Osler Hoskin & Harcourt LLP  Ask an Expert  Q: What are the key elements when looking into crypto projects from a legal perspective?  A: From a legal perspective, three key areas that I look at in assessing a crypto project are: compliance, governance and security. Does the team include dedicated, competent individuals looking after these areas? While it is natural and expected that the team has technical and marketing expertise, I would also want to see individuals with strong legal and financial experience to ensure that the company has been established in compliance with local laws to be able to operate as it intends and that it has an awareness about international laws and norms that could impact execution of their proposed business plan. I would prefer to see these individuals in key leadership and decision-making positions, although if the company is in a very early stage, then at least advisors to the company should include lawyers and accountants or those with a strong legal and financial management background. If the company is intending to or has issued a token, I would also expect to see a legal opinion from relevant jurisdictions to ensure compliance with local laws and regulations.  Q: How can advisors help their clients make investment decisions based on this information?  A: Legal compliance and governance are factors included in any investor’s assessment of the risks involved in a proposed project. They are not the only factors by any means, just part of the calculus in assessing whether or not to invest. Particularly in the crypto industry there are still many legal issues which fall into gray areas – and therefore potentially of higher risk. It will depend on the investor’s risk tolerance and judgment as to whether the potential returns on a project outweigh the potential risks.  Q: What is a good example of a project from a legal perspective?  A: Projects that are beyond the startup stage and have a record of good compliance and governance practices are going to be easier subjects for due diligence. Licenses, registrations and required filings will already be in place, as well as guidelines for internal practices and operations that are generally in written form. This is in contrast to early-stage startups. In those cases, more emphasis will be given to the individual team members and their previous experience and track records in other projects as well as the white paper that contemplates the regulatory framework that the project will operate in as well as how governance issues will be handled internally.  While these comments are quite generic and can apply to any project, they are of particular importance in the crypto field where, from a legal perspective, many things are still in a state of flux. Lawyers are tasked with gathering as much objective information as possible to present the prospective investor with an assessment that enables a well informed decision.  - David Ben Kay, President, Function X  Keep Reading  Spot ether exchange-traded funds launched on July 23rd, and trade volumes reached $300 million in the first hour.

31530113,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=631529,1721916040,"Could Bitcoin Soar To $100,000 With Trump Back In The White House?","Anticipation is at a high degree as the 2024 Bitcoin Conference draws near, driven not just by technical developments but also by the surprising backing of an influential person: Donald Trump. Related Reading: Is The US Emulating Germany? $4 Million Bitcoin Movement Raises Questions The surprising acceptance of Bitcoin by the former president may change the crypto scene and throw lengthy shadows over political debate and market projections. Here is a look at how Trump’s potential presidency can impact the direction of the crypto. The Bitcoin Turnaround Of Trump Once a strong opponent of Bitcoin, Donald Trump has changed his language dramatically. Even suggesting Bitcoin as a possible reserve currency alongside the US dollar, his campaign has aggressively embraced the digital asset. This fresh zeal differs greatly from his past posture, where he wrote out Bitcoin as a “scam.” In recent discussions, the former president has labeled Bitcoin as “digital gold.” His campaign vows to boost the digital asset’s acceptability. This might give companies and investors more confidence, adding more appeal to Bitcoin. Regulatory Change And Economic Effects Trump’s possible impact on Bitcoin is mostly dependent on his attitude to regulation. Given JD Vance’s pro-crypto posture, Trump’s choice of running mate suggests a likely tsunami of favorable crypto laws. Clearer rules and more institutional Bitcoin investment might find their path in this regulatory climate. Another important element for the dynamics of Bitcoin’s price might be Trump’s economic plans. His platform emphasizes on lowering inflation and enhancing economic stability—qualities that directly influence the value of Bitcoin. Trump’s economic policies were blamed with a somewhat consistent investment environment over his past presidency. Should he be successful in fostering a better economic climate, Bitcoin would gain from more liquidity and investor confidence. Conjecture And Market Responses The market for Bitcoin is driven by speculation, hence Trump’s close relationship with the crypto asset has magnified this influence. Recent events, like the attempted murder of Trump, have demonstrated how drastically market mood may respond to political changes. After the episode, the crypto enjoyed a big surge; meme coins and market mood reflected the great stakes of Trump’s involvement. Meanwhile, post-assassination attempt, the former commander in chief’s ratings against Biden rose somewhat (see chart below). Trump’s erratic political path fuels even more conjecture about his possible administration. The result of the election is still unknown even if Kamala Harris is becoming a strong competitor. Harris’s opinion on Bitcoin might potentially affect market dynamics, therefore adding even another level of intricacy to the future of the currency. Analyses disagree on the possible effect of a Trump win on the price of Bitcoin as the election gets near. While some see a positive trend with Bitcoin maybe skyrocketing above $100,000, others remain wary expecting firmer indications from Trump’s campaign and plans. BTC Price Forecast Technical signs show Bitcoin will rise significantly in the following week. The cryptocurrency is trading 33% below our monthly projection, predicting a comeback if market circumstances improve. Bullish indications like a rising moving average and a stronger Relative Strength Index (RSI) imply BTC might rectify its undervaluation and reach the forecasted price goal. Related Reading: Ethereum Name Service (ENS) 153% Rally ‘Underway’, Analyst Says Bitcoin’s expected three-month rise of 536% and six-month growth of 53% shows investor confidence. Analysts expect a 148% growth in BTC over one year, indicating its long-term potential. Positive trendline breakouts and solid support levels back this projection.

The miner said in a statement on Thursday that it now holds over 20,000 bitcoin, worth nearly $1.3 billion based on current prices, on its balance sheet and plans to buy more in the open market.  ""Bitcoin’s recent price decline, coupled with the strength of our balance sheet, afforded us an opportunity to add to our holdings. We look forward to continuing to leverage our technological expertise to support Bitcoin and distributed digital asset ecosystems,” said Marathon's CFO Salman Khan.  Read more: Bitcoin Miners Have Considerable Upside From Their Power Portfolios: Bernstein  The decision to HODL or holding onto bitcoin comes almost year after Marathon started to sell its mined digital assets to pay for the company's operating expenses. Prior to the crypto winter, most miners adopted the strategy to hold on to all the mined bitcoin in their balance sheet, which paid off during the bull market rally. However, as market imploded last year, most miners started to sell their mined bitcoin to pay for operating expenses and Marathon was one of the last one to start monetizing their digital assets in early 2023.  ""Adopting a full HODL strategy reflects our confidence in the long-term value of bitcoin,"" said Fred Thiel, Marathon’s chairman and CEO. ""We believe bitcoin is the world’s best treasury reserve asset and support the idea of sovereign wealth funds holding it. We encourage governments and corporations to all hold bitcoin as a reserve asset.”  After the prolonged bear market, bitcoin started to recoup its losses this year after the likes of BlackRock got approval to offer spot BTC exchange traded-funds (ETFs) in the U.S. This move brought more investors into the market and helped the digital asset reach a new all-time-high price. Bitcoin has come off its peak of over $70,000 since then and now trading around $64,000 - still up 51% this year.  “Given Bitcoin’s current tailwinds, including increased institutional support and an improving macro environment, we are once again implementing this strategy and focusing on growing the amount we hold on our balance sheet,"" Marathon's CFO said.  Marathon held $268 million in cash in its balance sheet as of June 30 and will report its second quarter earnings Aug. 1.

31526775,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=631528,1721910648,End Of The Road? Shiba Inu’s Shibarium Sees Massive 80.3% Crash In Active Accounts,"The Shibarium network, an Ethereum Layer 2 network that was developed and launched by the Shiba Inu team, did well following its initial launch in August 2023. However, less than one year following its launch, the Layer 2 network has run into some hard times, losing market share to larger counterparts. This has led to a decline in activity for the network as a whole, and so far this week, the Shibarium network has seen a major decline in active accounts. Shibarium Active Accounts Drop 80.3% In 4 Days The Shibarium network is currently struggling with adoption of the blockchain as its parent Layer 1 blockchain, Ethereum, is fighting against the likes of Solana to keep its users. Furthermore, Ethereum Layer 2 networks such as Base by Coinbase have also drawn out a reasonable number of decentralized finance (DeFi) users, putting it ahead of Shibarium. Related Reading: Golden Cross Appears On XRP Price Chart, Factors That Could Drive A Fresh Rally As a result of this, the Shibarium network has been unable to keep users, leading to a decline in active addresses. According to data from ShibariumScan, active accounts at the start of the week, on Sunday, July 21, were sitting at a mere 667. As the week has drawn on, this already small figure has crashed further down. On Wednesday, July 24, the total active accounts recorded on the Shibarium network was only 131. This means that between Sunday and Wednesday, the total active accounts on the Ethereum Layer 2 network had plummeted by 80.3%. In the same vein, there has also been a notable decline in new transactions. This metric saw a total of 6,353 transactions on Sunday. However, by Wednesday, the figures had declined to 1,023, representing an approximately 84% decline. Likewise, the number of new blocks mined dropped 66.6% from 17,220 on Tuesday to 5,739 on Wednesday. These all show that interest in the Shibarium network is completely down with number of new accounts created was only 11 on Tuesday, July 23. Playing With The Big Dogs While the popularity and success of Shiba Inu over the years played into the anticipation for the Shibarium network, it has failed to live up to the app. When it comes to Ethereum Layer 2 networks that were launched between 2023 and 2024, the Shibarium network doesn’t hold up a candle to these other players. Currently, the Total Value Locked (TVL) on the Shibarium network is only $1.5 million, according to data from DeFiLlama. In contrast, Coinbase’s Base network was launched in the same month of August 2023 as Shibarium currently boasts $2.175 billion in TVL. Related Reading: Analyst Says Solana Price Will Surge 1,000% To $1,800, Here’s When The Linea network was launched a few months before Shibarium in March 2023, and the Layer 2 network currently has a TVL of $1.198 billion. Likewise, the BLAST network, which was launched much later in February 2024, has $1.47 billion in TVL. What this suggests is that the Shibarium network may have failed, given its incredibly low usage. However, there is always the question of if the Layer 2 network will be able to rise from the ashes and become a top DeFi contender once again.

42417614,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZBnR,1721908903,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Slides After Wednesday's Tech Rout,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin {{BTC}} fell to just above $64,000 amid a stock market rout and weakening sentiment for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. The plunge led to over $250 million worth of bullish bets being liquidated, the worst hit since early July. Bitcoin is priced around $64,200 at the time of writing, a drop of almost 3.5% in the last 24 hours. The broader digital asset market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), has fallen 5.6%. The slump follows the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index posting its biggest drop since 2022 after Google parent company Alphabet and Tesla reported mixed quarterly earnings.  Ether {{ETH}} has fallen over 8% in the last 24 hours, faring worse than the wider crypto market, following $327 million worth of outflows from Grayscale's Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE). Most of the other ETH ETFs continued in the green during the Wednesday session, with BlackRock's ETHA leading the pack at $283.9 million of net inflows, followed by Bitwise's ETHW at $233.6 million and Fidelity's FETH with $145.7 million. ETHE bucking this trend echoes the plight of Grayscale's bitcoin equivalent, GBTC, which experienced heavy outflows when it listed earlier this year. Ether is trading at $3,165 at the time of writing.  The aggregate market capitalization of the stablecoin sector, which includes hundreds of coins, jumped to over $164 billion for the first time since the collapse of Terra in May 2022, according to data source DefiLlama and trading firm Wintermute. It had been languishing around the $160 billion mark. The expansion ""indicates growing investor optimism, underpinning a bullish outlook,"" Wintermute said in a note shared with CoinDesk. ""The increase in stablecoin supply indicates that money is being deposited into on-chain ecosystems to generate economic activity, either through direct on-chain purchases that can catalyze price appreciation or yield-generation strategies that could improve [market] liquidity. This activity ultimately fosters positive on-chain growth.""  Chart of the Day  Activity in Chicago Mercantile Exchange's ether futures reached new heights on Tuesday as the debut of spot ETH ETFs in the U.S. galvanized investor interest in the second-largest cryptocurrency.  The previous peak of 7,550 contracts was set one month ago. The standard contract is sized at 50 ETH.  CME witnessed 14,736 contracts change hands on Tuesday, which is three times higher than the average daily volume of 5,010 contracts seen throughout July. Tuesday was also one of the top 10 volume days for ether futures.  Giovanni Vicioso, global head of cryptocurrency products at CME Group, attributed the surge in activity to the onset of spot ether ETF trading in the U.S.  Source: Chicago Mercantile Exchange  - Omkar Godbole  Trending Posts  India to Release Its Crypto Policy Stance by September After Stakeholder Consultations: Report  Coinbase Asset Management Plans Tokenized Money-Market Fund, a Hot Area After BlackRock's BUIDL Success: Sources  Deutsche Telekom Joins RWA-Focused XDC as Infrastructure Provider in Digital Asset Push  CORRECTION (July 25, 15:43 UTC): Corrects outflows from Grayscale's converted Ethereum Trust ETF in second news item.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,"Jamie Crawley, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/25/first-mover-americas-bitcoin-slides-after-wednesdays-tech-rout,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d14100768ce21bc5111da3f0fa44274de1f07a5a-780x518.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In 2023 Russian-language darknet markets comprised 95% of all crypto-denominated illicit drug sales that occurred on the dark web.  Inflows to Russia-based exchange, Garantex, accounted for 82% of the crypto from sanctioned entities, despite restrictions being imposed due to the war on Ukraine.  Illicit use of crypto for ransomware, drug sales, and sanction evasion was rife in Russia in 2023 according to a report by TRM Labs on Thursday.  Russian-speaking ransomware groups were responsible for at least 69% of all crypto proceeds from ransomware in 2023, which exceeded $500 million. Ransomware is a type of malware that prevents a user from accessing a device until a sum is paid.  The two largest ransomware operators in 2023 were Lockbit and ALPHV/Black Cat, both Russian-speaking groups. However, in February the U.K. National Crime Agency said it had managed to take control of Lockbits services ""compromising their entire criminal enterprise,"" according to an article at the time.  In 2023, Russian exchange Garantex accounted for 82% of the crypto volumes from sanctioned entities internationally, the report said.  Due to Russia's war on Ukraine, nations around the world placed sanctions on the country leading to some turning to crypto to evade them. U.S. sanctions watchdog, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) blacklisted a bitcoin and ether address last year tied to sanctions evasion. Plus, U.S. federal prosecutors alleged in 2022 that five Russian nationals had laundered millions of dollars worth of crypto.  In 2023 Russian-language darknet markets comprised 95% of all crypto-denominated illicit drug sales that occurred on the dark web, the report added.

42417596,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZBUr,1721907608,Coinbase's CBPL Fined $4.5M by UK Regulator for Lapses in Onboarding Controls,"Coinbase's CB Payments Ltd. (CBPL) was fined 3.5 million pounds ($4.5 million) by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for offering services to high-risk customers.  Despite the restrictions in place, CBPL onboarded and/or provided e-money services to 13,416 high-risk customers, the FCA said.  CORRECTOIN (July 25, 13:20 UTC): Corrects headline and first paragraph to say fine related to onboarding high-risk customers. An earlier version said the fine related to money launderings lapses.  CB Payments Ltd. (CBPL), an e-money institution and payments processor tied to crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) was fined more than 3.5 million pounds ($4.5 million) by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for lapses in controls designed to prevent onboarding of so-called high-risk customers.  The London-based company, which is authorized by FCA and doesn't itself offer cryptocurrency services, acts as a gateway for customers to trade crypto on entities within the Coinbase group.  Concerns about the company's controls over financial crime were raised in February 2020 after the FCA visited its offices, and CBPL then entered into a voluntary agreement that prevented it from taking on new high-risk customers while it addressed those issues.  ""Despite the restrictions in place, CBPL onboarded and/or provided e-money services to 13,416 high-risk customers,"" the FCA said in a release on Thursday. ""Approximately 31 per cent of these customers deposited around USD $24.9 million. These funds were used to make withdrawals and then execute multiple cryptoasset transactions via other Coinbase Group entities, totalling approximately USD $226 million.""  The breaches, which were not discovered for almost two years, resulted from CBPL’s lack of skill in monitoring the controls put in place to ensure that the agreement was effective, the FCA said.  ""Coinbase remains committed to high standards of regulatory compliance, and this means partnering with regulators when it comes to compliance and other areas,"" the company said in the blog post.

The steepening of the U.S. Treasury yield curve is the biggest risk, one observer said.  Risk assets slid Thursday as China's second interest-rate cut in a week sparked concerns of instability in the world's second-largest economy.  Bitcoin {{BTC}}, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, fell almost 2% since midnight UTC to around $64,000 and ether {{ETH}} dropped more than 5%, dragging the wider altcoin market lower. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a measure of the broader crypto market, lost 4.6% in 24 hours.  In equity markets, Germany's DAX, France's CAC and the eurozone's Euro Stoxx 50 fell over 1.5%, and futures tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 were slightly lower after the index's 3% slide on Wednesday, according to data source Investing.com.  Early Thursday, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) announced a surprise, off-schedule cut in its one-year medium-term lending facility rate to 2.3% from 2.5%, injecting 200 billion yuan ($27.5 billion) of liquidity into the market. That's the biggest reduction since 2020.  The move, along with similar reductions in other borrowing rates early this week, shows urgency among policymakers to shore up growth after its recent third plenum offered little hope of a boost. Data released early this month showed China's economy expanded by 4.7% in the second quarter at an annualized pace, much weaker than the estimated 5.1%, and slower than first quarter's 5.3%.  ""Equity futures are stable after yesterday's bloody session that shook views across all asset classes,"" Ilan Solot, senior global strategist at Marex Solutions, said in a note shared with CoinDesk. ""The decision by the PBoC to cut rates in a surprise move only added to the sense of panic."" Marex Solutions, a division of global financial platform Marex, specializes in creating and distributing customized derivatives products and issuing crypto-linked structured products.  Solot noted the ongoing ""steepening of the U.S. Treasury yield curve"" as a threat to risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, echoing CoinDesk's reporting from early this month.  The yield curve steepens when the difference between longer-duration and shorter-duration bond yields increases. This month, the spread between 10-year and two-year Treasury yields has risen by 20 basis points to -0.12 basis points (bps), mainly due to stickier 10-year yields.  The so-called de-inversion or re-steepening from inversion (or negative spread) has historically coincided with risk aversion.  ""For me, the biggest concern is the shape of the U.S. yield curve, which continues steepening. The 2- and 10-year curve is not only -12bps inverted, compared to -50bps just last month. The recent moves have been led by rising back-end [10y] yields and falling short-end ones,"" Solot said.  That's a sign markets expect the Fed to cut rates but see stickier inflation and expansionary fiscal policy as growing risks, Solot said.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/25/bitcoin-stocks-bleed-as-china-rate-cuts-signals-panic-treasury-yield-curve-steepens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/18bdeaa130e87485d78e6912775037a520656efe-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

31523473,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=631549,1721905224,Cardano (ADA) Dips Under $0.4233: Will the Bears Continue to Rule?,"The cryptocurrency market has seen a recent downturn, with Cardano (ADA) experiencing a notable decline, dropping below the $0.4233 mark. This drop can be attributed to the recent shift in market sentiment towards a bearish outlook. The critical question now is whether this bearish momentum will continue or if a potential rebound is on the horizon. This article examines the current market position and technical indicators to offer a comprehensive analysis of the impact of ADA’s price falling below $0.4233. It also evaluates whether this negative momentum will persist or if a potential reversal is on the horizon. In the past day, the price of Cardano has dropped by 5.45%, trading at roughly $0.396 at the time of writing. The cryptocurrency has more than $14 billion in market value and $376 million in trading volume. Over the past day, there has been a 5.35% decrease in ADA’s market capitalization and a 7.32% rise in trading volume. Current Market Overview: ADA’s Recent Decline On the 4-hour chart, the price of ADA is currently bearish and trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) after successfully dropping below $0.4233. It is also important to note that after this break, Cardano has been on a bearish trajectory toward the $0.3389 support level. Also, the signal line of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator has fallen below 50%. This decline suggests that ADA could continue its current bearish trend toward the $0.3389 support level. On the 1-day chart, it’s evident that ADA’s price is currently bearish and has significantly fallen below both the 100-day SMA and the $0.4233 support level. Since breaking below the $0.4233 support mark, Cardano has consistently maintained a bearish trajectory toward the $0.3389 support level and will potentially continue in this trend for a while. Finally, it can be observed that the signal line of the 1-day RSI indicator has also dropped below 50% and is currently heading toward the oversold zone. This position of the RSI indicator suggests a potential further decline for ADA. Potential Scenarios: Will Cardano Rebound Or Continue Downward? If Cardano can sustain its current bearish momentum to reach the $0.3389 support mark and close below, the price may continue to move downward to test the $0.2388 support level. Should this level be breached, the digital asset may experience further price drop toward other lower ranges. Conversely, if ADA’s price rebounds at the $0.3389 support level, it could start to move upward again, heading toward the $0.4233 target. Additionally, when ADA breaks above this level, the crypto asset could see further price gains, testing the $0.5229 resistance level and possibly moving towards even higher levels.

The premise of the technology is to avoid pitfalls of centralized AI models, which might be prone to censorship or monopoly control, according to a press release shared exclusively with CoinDesk on Thursday.  The project relies on ""personal AIs,"" referred to as ""smart agents,"" which could be paid for using cryptocurrencies, according to the release. It is being deployed on Arbitrum's Sepolia test network.  ""The new Morpheus public testnet will be used to decentralize and more efficiently allocate AI compute power across the Morpheus AI network and enable users to engage in a decentralized Chat GPT-like interface,"" Lumerin said.  Started in 2021, Lumerin describes itself as an ""open-source protocol and foundational layer technology that uses smart contracts to control how peer-to-peer data streams are accessed, routed and transacted.""  Lumerin's first use case was a peer-to-peer, decentralized marketplace for trading Bitcoin hashpower – the computing power needed to find and confirm new blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain.  The project is now ""leveraging its existing codebase to build the core node software for Morpheus,"" its website reads.  According to the Morpheus technical documentation, or ""white paper,"" the project is expected to bring functional advantages over existing AI systems such as large language models (LLMs), since it's already in ""Web3"" – shorthand for technologies that are built on decentralized networks and designed to work with cryptocurrencies. Key capabilities could include running decentralized applications (dapps) and interacting with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.  ""Being Web3 native, the user can buy or sell crypto, send stablecoins, access smart contracts and use dapps and DeFi services, which no LLM is connected to today,"" the white paper reads.

The initiative could prevent forgery and reduce processing time from a month to three days.  Raipur, the capital city of the Indian state of Chhattisgarh, has started bringing its real estate records on to the blockchain with the help of Airchains, which builds blockchain-based bespoke privacy models through its use of zero-knowledge fully homomorphic encryption (zk-FHE)  The Raipur Municipal Corporation administers the area issuing more than 8,000 building permits, work orders, and colony development permissions annually. The corporation floated a tender to have its records on blockchain and Airchains emerged as the partner through that process, Abinash Mishra, Commissioner, Raipur Municipal Corporation told CoinDesk in an interview on Thursday.  ""We issue building permission certificates and previously we have had many issues such as forgery of documents,"" Mishra said. ""We developed the solution with the Airchains team and now we are exploring similar digital documentation through blockchain of essential services that urban bodies usually produce which are birth, death and marriage certificates.""  Airchains CEO Ankur Rakhi Sinha told CoinDesk that this marks the first use case of Zero-Knowledge Fully Homomorphic Encryption (zk-FHE) in India. ""ZK is used to prove that something is true without revealing any additional information, whereas FHE is used to perform computations on encrypted data without needing to decrypt it,"" Sinha writes in a blog.  The Raipur Municipal Corporation has their own server sets and all the encryption keys are ordered with the government body itself, Sinha said.  ""As of now, we are not on chain live yet, we are encrypting the old certificates and have completed around 100,000 certificates on ZK and once we go live we will bring the current (daily) data too,"" Sinha said. ""Every building permission will have its own smart contract, and every update on the building permission will be updated on that similar smart contract.""  Mishra of the Raipur Municipal Corporation told CoinDesk that the verification of the facts in the building permission applications takes ""at least one month"" between ""seven days"" for a bank to pass a loan and communicating that to the municipal commissioner who will then write to the subordinate. The goal here is to reduce that time to a matter of three days.  ""Certification should be secure and decentralization is the future we should work on,"" Mishra said. ""This is small initiative we have taken. I think many people will adopt it.""  Airchains has previously worked with other Indian state authorities on similar projects.

A special task force has been constituted to monitor such suspicious transactions.  India has seen as many as 92 cases since 2020 till April 2024 involving dark net and cryptocurrencies to purchase drugs, the nation's junior Home Minister Nityanand Rai said to parliament on Wednesday.  Rai's response was to questions about drug trafficking from Jose K. Mani, a minister of parliament (MP) from the opposition. One of the questions posed asked ""whether (the) Government has noticed increasing use of technology and other online methods while conducting drug trafficking in the country?""  The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), the nodal agency on drug law enforcement matters, booked three of such dark net and crypto-related cases in 2020, 49 in 2021, eight in 2022, 21 in 2023 and 11 until April 2024.  The data did not provide a distinction between how many of the 92 cases were solely dark net related and how many were solely crypto related in terms of methods of transactions.  In the same duration, 1025 cases involving parcels or couriers were reported.  Rai also said along with other prevention methods, a special task force has been constituted to monitor such suspicious transactions related to drugs.

ENS has shown it can bounce back with an almost 4% rise in the last week. Its success over the last 30 days has been even better, with a 15% increase. People think that the release of Ethereum ETFs will be a big part of making ENS more well-known and appealing. These ETFs are a big change in the world of cryptocurrencies, and they might get more investors interested. Related Reading: Is The US Emulating Germany? $4 Million Bitcoin Movement Raises Questions As Ethereum ETFs become more popular, they could lead to more demand for Ethereum-based assets, such as ENS, which would make it even more visible in the market. The price of ENS is $25.80 right now, and it’s worth $852 million on the market. Ethereum Name Service: Market Sentiment Even though ENS lost 9% in the last 24 hours, the general direction for the altcoin remains positive. Bitcoin’s recent drop to $65,500 is one factor that caused this short-term drop. This has put downward pressure on altcoins, including ENS. But Bitcoin has recently risen from its support level, which could mean that the negative pressure is over. $ENS (Ethereum Name Service) sustaining majorly here and returning with signs of strength towards the $76.121 target! With a breakout holding and significant progress towards this target already taking place, the run to meet it can already be underway and another +153% from here… https://t.co/hgiLnXUevs pic.twitter.com/sQWCVajAKC — JAVON⚡️MARKS (@JavonTM1) July 23, 2024 The market is once again feeling optimistic, which means that the price drop for ENS might not last long. As the market as a whole improves, Ethereum Name Service is ready to take advantage of the good vibe. This makes it an interesting asset for buyers to keep an eye on in the coming weeks. The well-known cryptocurrency expert Javon Marks has made a positive prediction about Ethereum Name Service. He thinks that its price will go up a lot. In fact, he said the altcoin’s price increase is “underway.” He estimates the altcoin to hit the $76.12. ENS has been breaking out in a way that he thinks shows a lot of strength and resolve. Analyst Predictions Marks talks about how current changes at the price point could be the start of a big rise. He predicts that the price of ENS could go up by about 153% from where it is now to this goal. Based on fundamental analysis and market trends, this confidence shows that ENS is in a great place to grow. The altcoin is moving 228% below its 1-month forecast, but Coincheckup predicts an upswing in seven days. This massive undervaluation signals tremendous potential. Positive news, technical signs, or market rebound may fuel the upswing. Coincheckup sees a 245% price increase in three months for ENS. With maintained good momentum, it predicts 180.55% growth over six months. The one-year projection suggests a 166.70% gain, indicating long-term confidence in the asset’s appreciation.

42417607,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZBgD,1721896295,Stablecoins Signal Crypto Ecosystem Buoyancy as Market Cap Jumps to $164B,"Expansion of the stablecoin market is bullish for the broader crypto ecosystem.  BTC and ETH slid amid broad-based risk aversion on Wall Street.  Stablecoins, which serve as a funding source for many crypto trading strategies, are experiencing growth after months of stagnation in a sign of renewed capital influx into the crypto market.  The aggregate market capitalization of the stablecoin sector, which includes hundreds of coins, jumped to over $164 billion for the first time since the collapse of Terra in May 2022, according to data source DefiLlama and trading firm Wintermute. It had been languishing around the $160 billion mark.  Stablecoins are digital currencies whose values are pegged to an external reference, such as the U.S. dollar. Tether's USDT, the leading dollar-pegged stablecoin, alone boasts a market capitalization of $114.26 billion.  These coins help investors mitigate market volatility because they maintain a fixed value to the external reference. They are widely used to fund crypto purchases, derivatives trading and yield-generation strategies like lending through decentralized finance (DeFi). Stablecoins are also utilized for real-world payments and cross-border remittances.  The expansion ""indicates growing investor optimism, underpinning a bullish outlook,"" Wintermute said in a note shared with CoinDesk. ""The increase in stablecoin supply indicates that money is being deposited into on-chain ecosystems to generate economic activity, either through direct on-chain purchases that can catalyze price appreciation or yield-generation strategies that could improve [market] liquidity. This activity ultimately fosters positive on-chain growth.""  Blockchain analytics firm Nansen voiced a similar opinion on X, calling the stablecoin expansion a bullish development.  Still, the two biggest cryptocurrencies – bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} – have declined 5.5% and 10%, respectively, this week, CoinDesk data show.  The price swoon is likely due to a ""sell the fact"" reaction to Tuesday's debut of the highly anticipated spot ether ETFs in the U.S. and the sharp slide in Wall Street's tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index. The index fell 3.7% on Wednesday, wiping out $1 trillion in market value.  The ongoing decline in the copper-to-gold ratio and the steepening of the U.S. Treasury yield curve favors risk-off sentiment.

The analysis, titled “Bitcoin 2050 Valuation Scenarios: Global Medium of Exchange and Reserve Asset,” paints a picture of Bitcoin transforming into a cornerstone of the global monetary framework, functioning as both a major international medium of exchange and a reserve currency. How Bitcoin Could Hit $52.38 Million The report elaborates on Bitcoin’s potential trajectory, forecasting its establishment as a primary reserve currency by mid-century. “By 2050, we see bitcoin solidifying its position as a key international medium of exchange, ultimately becoming one of the world’s reserve currencies,” the researchers state. This scenario is founded on the expectation that the current trust in traditional reserve assets will erode, mainly due to the unsustainable fiscal policies and geopolitical decisions of today’s economic leaders.

VanEck predicts that the resolution of Bitcoin’s scalability issues through emerging Layer-2 solutions will significantly enhance its functionality, making it an attractive option in the financial systems of developing nations. “The combination of Bitcoin’s immutable property rights and sound money principles with the enhanced functionality provided by L2 solutions could enable the creation of a global financial system capable of better meeting the developing world’s needs,” Sigel and Bush argue. Within their analysis of the International Monetary System (IMS), VanEck underscores the declining relevance of the principal currencies—USD, EUR, JPY, and GBP—in global trade. They foresee a reduction in their collective share of cross-border payments from 86% in 2023 to 64% in 2050. “This opens significant opportunities for Bitcoin to become an important alternative to settle international trade,” the report suggests. The base case scenario envisions Bitcoin reaching a valuation of $2.9 million per coin by 2050. This prediction is anchored in the cryptocurrency’s projected role in settling a portion of global trade—10% of international and 5% of domestic trade—combined with a significant allocation as a central bank reserve. “This scenario would result in central banks holding 2.5% of their assets in BTC, contributing to a total market cap of $61 trillion.” In this view, Bitcoin is anticipated to make up 1.66% of World Financial Assets, leveraging the anticipated growth in global trade and investment demand. Related Reading: Bitcoin Traders Brace for Impact: QCP Capital Signals Incoming Price Drop—Here’s Why The bull case, however, projects The bull case scenario presented by VanEck outlines an even more optimistic outlook where Bitcoin’s integration into the global economy is profoundly more significant. The report suggests Bitcoin could facilitate 20% of global international trade and 10% of domestic trade volumes by 2050. In this scenario Bitcoin comprises a staggering 29.79% of global financial assets. Notably, this scenario implies that nearly 99% of Bitcoin’s supply would be removed from circulation, attributed to its store of value properties, leaving only about 210,000 BTC in active circulation. The report also highlights existing limitations in Bitcoin’s ability to function as a medium of international trade, particularly its current transaction processing capacity and lack of support for complex smart contracts. However, VanEck is optimistic about future improvements, suggesting that “ongoing development in Bitcoin’s infrastructure, particularly through Layer-2 solutions, will progressively enhance its functionality and appeal as a robust, decentralized financial system.” Concluding the analysis, VanEck envisions Bitcoin not merely as a financial tool but as a transformative economic force that redefines money in a global context. “Bitcoin applies constitutional constraints to money, representing a system created by the people, for the people, and might serve as the ultimate check against the often arbitrary financial powers of the state,” the report reflects. At press time, BTC traded at $64,210.

In September 2023, Seth said India would analyse and decide its own position on crypto in the ""coming months.""  India plans to put out a discussion paper outlining its policy stance on cryptocurrencies before September, according to Indian news outlet Moneycontrol, citing an interview with Economic Affairs Secretary Ajay Seth.  Seth's interview does not suggest a commitment to regulating crypto through a comprehensive legislation but instead a position based on stakeholder consensus on the matter.  ““The policy stance is how does one consult relevant stakeholders, so it is to come out in the open and say here is a discussion paper these are the issues and then stakeholders will give their views,” said Seth who is the Economic Affairs Secretary. ""At the moment, an inter-ministerial group, is looking into a wider policy for cryptocurrencies. We expect to come out with the discussion paper before September.""  The inter-ministerial group includes India's central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), and market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). The RBI has been averse to legitimizing crypto or stablecoins, seeking instead to prohibit them because, it argues, digital assets pose macro economic stability risks for the emerging nation. SEBI has been not been opposed to regulating digital assets and has recently said that the oversight of cryptocurrency trading should be vested in several authorities.  India does not have a comprehensive crypto legislation but has imposed stiff taxes on the sector. However, it has introduced a requirement for crypto entities to get registered with the country's Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU-IND) to adhere to anti-money laundering (AML) and terrorism financing standards set by global bodies such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), marking a credibility shift for the industry.  “In India it (cryptocurrencies) is being regulated from the perspective of AML and EFT (Electronic Funds Transfer) alone. Regulation starts and ends there, it cannot be beyond that, so should the remit be more? What should be the policy stance? All that will come out in the discussion paper,"" Seth said according to the report.  In September 2023, Seth said India would analyse and decide its own position on crypto in the ""coming months"" after considering global leaders' stance on an acceptable crypto rule framework. That statement had come on the sidelines of India's presidency of the Group of 20 in which it had prioritized consensus based framing of global crypto rules.

Over $250 million in bullish bets were wiped out, marking the most substantial liquidation since early July.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} nosedived over 3% at the start of Asian trading hours amid a broader stock market rout and weakening sentiment for risk assets such as cryptocurrencies.  BTC fell from over $65,500 to nearly $64,000 within minutes at the start of Tokyo trading. The sudden plunge led to over $250 million bullish bets being liquidated, the worst hit since early July.  Liquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. Such data is beneficial for traders as it serves as a signal of leverage being effectively washed out from popular futures products – acting as a short-term indication of a decline in price volatility.  The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index tracking the largest tokens by capitalization, minus stablecoins, fell by 3.3%.  Ether {{ETH}} longs lost the most at $100 million, driven by a 7.5% slump in the token amid outflows from the newly launched ETH ETF.  Binance recorded the highest liquidations among exchanges at $118 million, of which 88% were long trades.

Activity in Chicago Mercantile Exchange's (CME) ether {{ETH}} futures reached new heights on Tuesday as the debut of spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. galvanized investor interest in the second-largest cryptocurrency.  The so-called open interest or the number of active bets in standard ether futures rose to a record of 7,661 contracts, equaling 383,650 ETH and $1.4 billion in notional terms, the exchange said in an email to CoinDesk. The previous peak of 7,550 contracts was set one month ago. The standard contract is sized at 50 ETH.  Speaking of trading volumes, the derivatives giant witnessed 14,736 contracts change hands on Tuesday, which is three times higher than the average daily volume of 5,010 contracts seen throughout July. Tuesday was also one of the top 10 volume days for ether futures.  Giovanni Vicioso, global head of cryptocurrency products at CME Group, attributed the surge in activity to the onset of spot ether ETF trading in the U.S.  ""The approval and subsequent trading of spot ether ETFs in the U.S. has reinvigorated the market, driving significant growth in volume across our Ether suite and leading to record open interest for our flagship Ether futures,"" Vicioso said in the email.  ""As more and more traders seek exposure to cryptocurrencies, our suite of regulated, reliable and deeply liquid bitcoin and ether futures products continue to provide transparent tools for managing risk and capitalizing on market opportunities,"" Vicioso added.  Spot ETFs hold ether, meaning investors in the fund have exposure to the actual cryptocurrency rather than derivatives tied to the digital asset. The ETFs are widely expected to pull billions of dollars worth of investor money in the coming months.  These funds can be used to take both directional and non-directional arbitrage bets, such as carry trades, as observed in the bitcoin market.

31511734,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=631331,1721885437,Ethereum Spot ETF Hype: ETH Whale Activity 64% More Than BTC,"On-chain data shows whale activity on the Ethereum blockchain has been quite high recently due to the excitement around the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Ethereum Whales Showing Significantly Higher Activity Than Bitcoin Ones According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, Ethereum whales have been displaying considerable activity recently. The indicator of relevance here is the “Whale Transaction Count,” which keeps track of the total amount of transfers happening on any given network carrying a value of at least $100,000. Related Reading: XRP Whales Go On $84 Million Buying Spree: Rally To Continue? Transfers exceeding this amount are generally associated with the whales, so this indicator’s value can provide insight into the activity of these humongous investors. When the metric’s value is high, the blockchain is currently observing many large transactions. Such a trend implies the whales have an active interest in trading the asset. On the other hand, the low indicator suggests the whales may not be paying much attention to the cryptocurrency as they aren’t making that many transfers. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Whale Transaction Count for the top three coins in the sector, Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH, and Tether (USDT), since the start of the year: As is visible in the above graph, the Whale Transaction Count for Ethereum has been the highest out of these three assets recently. More specifically, ETH has seen 77,200 whale transactions since the 17th of this month, notably higher than BTC’s 47,000 or USDT’s 34,100. The sharp spike in activity for the asset is likely the hype around the spot ETFs, which, after much anticipation, have finally been launched after gaining approval by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Whale Transaction Count would suggest the whales had started repositioning themselves before this launch. It’s hard to say, though, what type of activity exactly these large holders were participating in based on this indicator alone. Given that the event was considered bullish, it would make sense if the whales were buying. Data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has confirmed that large holders have recently increased their supply. IntoTheBlock defines “large holders” as investors who own at least 0.1% of the entire Ethereum supply in circulation. From the chart, it’s apparent that the netflow into the wallets of this cohort has remained positive over the past week, which coincides with the period that the whales have been active. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Forms Signal That Last Led To 123% Rally Yesterday alone, the Ethereum large holders bought 112,900 ETH, equivalent to around $391 million at the current exchange rate. “This accumulation notably surpasses the $106 million net inflows to the ETF,” notes the analytics firm. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $3,460, unchanged from one week ago.

Ethereum’s decline seems to be dragging ADA lower toward the $0.380 support. ADA price started a fresh decline from the $0.450 resistance zone. The price is trading below $0.4120 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.4060 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move down and test the $0.380 support zone. Cardano Price Shows Signs of More Downsides After a steady increase, Cardano faced sellers near the $0.450 resistance zone. ADA formed a short-term top and started a pullback below the $0.4250 level. Recently, Ethereum’s decline dragged it further lower below the $0.400 support. A low is formed near $0.3919 and the price is consolidating losses with a bearish angle. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.4060 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. Cardano price is now trading below $0.4100 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. If there is a recovery wave, the price might face resistance near the $0.4050 zone and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.4211 swing high to the $0.3919 low. The first resistance is near $0.4150 or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.4211 swing high to the $0.3919 low. The next key resistance might be $0.4220. If there is a close above the $0.4220 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.4450 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.4500. More Downsides in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.4050 resistance level, it could continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.3920 level. The next major support is near the $0.3800 level. A downside break below the $0.3800 level could open the doors for a test of $0.3650.

Dissecting the Bearish Sentiment The derivatives market has experienced a notable shift over the past day, with the implied volatility in Bitcoin options decreasing. Related Reading: Is The US Emulating Germany? $4 Million Bitcoin Movement Raises Questions This indicates that traders are worrying more about the possible downside risks. According to a note from analysts at QCP Capital, the spread between call and put options has tightened by three volatility points. QCP Capital noted: While spot prices remain muted, the options market is painting a different picture. 26 Jul vols made an impressive 8-vol rally with RR dipping by 3 vols signalling caution to the downside. This contraction reflects growing market caution as traders prepare for possible Bitcoin price declines amid increasing sell-pressure. Notably, the US government moving Bitcoin to exchanges like Coinbase and MtGox creditors beginning to receive their redistributed assets via Kraken, are contributing factors. These movements have injected substantial Bitcoin into the market, potentially suppressing prices further. QCP Capital’s analysts added: With the ETH Spot ETF potentially not impacting prices on the outset, coupled with potential selling pressure from the US Government and Mt Gox, prices may remain subdued until momentum builds up leading to the elections. The Positive Bitcoin Signal Amid the bearish sentiment from the derivative market shared by QCP Capital, some other Bitcoin metric suggest quite an opposite sentiment—Bullish. According to a CryptoQuant author on the QuickTake platform, there has been a significant increase in Bitcoin withdrawals from Kraken. This is particularly noteworthy as it comes at a time when Mt.Gox creditors are receiving their funds from the Kraken exchange. The analyst noted: This could be a positive signal, indicating that they are not selling and are preparing to hold their coins, moving them from the exchange to cold wallets. Although the volume is not high, over 5K $BTC (USD 329.192.018$) have been withdrawn in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, regardless of the mixed signals from both QCP Capital and the CryptoQuant analyst, BTC itself is still maintaining a crucial mark price above $66,000.

At the time of writing, the Shiba Inu price is still skirting around the $0.000017 level, and the price prediction puts it at $0.00003839. Such a price increase for the SHIB price would mean a 119.45% increase in less than a week. However, on a longer time frame, which is 30 days, the machine learning algorithm expects the price to turn bearish again. It puts it at a price of $0.00001686, which is a 3.66% decline from the current price. But would be an over 50% decline if the price does hit $0.00003839 in the next five days as predicted. When Will Shiba Inu Reach A New All-Time High? Despite the bullishness of the past year, the Shiba Inu price has failed to reclaim its 2021 all-time high of $0.00008845. Its current value puts it around 80% below this all-time high price, meaning that the meme coin still has a long way to go before it sets a new peak. According to the CoinCodex machine learning algorithm, investors in the Shiba Inu meme coin may be waiting a long time before this happens. The longer timeframe forecasts expect that the Shiba Inu price will hit a new all-time high in the year 2029 and rise as high as $0.000156. This would mean that it would take another half a decade before those who bought at the peak in October 2021 to see profit on their holdings again.

The token has surged over 230% in the past month, which propelled the token to a new all-time high (ATH). However, a crypto analyst has warned investors of a possible correction for the feline sensation. Related Reading: PolitiFi Memecoin Shakeout: BODEN Plummets 55% While KAMA Skyrockets 150% Following Biden Dropout POPCAT Leads The Clowder This month, Popcat has registered a remarkable performance. The token began climbing the chart on July 11, breaking above a $900 million market capitalization by July 16. That day, the Solana-based memecoin flipped Ethereum’s MOG and became the largest cat-themed token by market cap. Popcat continued its ascending trajectory, reaching a $1 billion market cap on July 20 and becoming the first ever cat memecoin to achieve this milestone. The following day, the token reached its ATH of $0.9939, according to CoinGecko data. Currently, the token is the eighth-largest memecoin by market cap, sitting above Cat in a dogs world (MEW) and MOG. MEW has also seen a remarkable performance in the past week, with a 98.2% surge in the last seven days. During Q2, the cat-themed tokens saw massive growth and infiltrated the top 10 memecoin list. Moreover, a CoinGecko survey revealed the category became the 14th most popular crypto narrative in the second quarter. Is A Correction Looming? Following its recent performance, some crypto analysts and investors considered that “Popcat is looking good.” Team Lambo Charts shared on X that the memecoin had “another fresh breakout done” earlier today. Per the post, the token broke out of the downtrend line after successfully retesting the $0.84 mark. If the cat-themed memecoin continues to hold above this price range, the analyst believes a retest of the $1 resistance level is possible. Based on this, he set an initial $1.08 target “for the overall 25% move short term.” VikingXBT, another market watcher, also commented on the token. To him, Popcat’s performance following its ATH “makes sense on the lower timeframe.” The analyst pointed out that the token “hit the psychological target a lot of people had.” He stated that the current retraces and retest of the old resistance are “molto buono.” Additionally, he suggested that investors embrace themselves “with a bit of patience” while the token resumes its climb. Nonetheless, not all analyses are confident about the memecoin’s recent performance. On Monday, renowned analyst Altcoin Sherpa shared his thoughts on X. Per the analyst, the chart “looks decent still but would be concerned if this prints a lower high/shoulder.” Sherpa thinks that if it happens, and Popcat starts to sell off, “all cat beta is going to die.” However, the analyst clarified he’s still bullish for now as he believes that cat-themed memecoins “will do pretty well and play catch up.” Related Reading: Ethereum ETFs Launch About To Kickstart The Altseason?
