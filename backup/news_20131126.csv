42425141,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHsrdh,1385489752,US Federal Elections Commission: Bitcoin Isn't Money,"How will bitcoin impact America's campaign finance system? Corruption, anonymous donations and foreign contributions stand out as some of the currency's biggest risks. Currently, these issues are being debated by policymakers at the Federal Election Commission (FEC).  A large portion of last week's FEC open meeting was taken up with a discussion about the Conservative Action Fund's (CAF) desire to start accepting bitcoins, something that chairwoman Ellen L Weintraub called “a seemingly exotic and novel issue”.  As a result, four advisory drafts were presented in a hearing last week by the FEC. One draft proposed that advisory opinion should be voted on.  Let's take a look at some of the interesting discussions these policymakers had regarding bitcoin.  Bitcoin isn't money  The question at hand is not really whether political groups can accept bitcoin. In reality, there are other units of value that groups already accept as in-kind donations; bitcoin should have a place not as money, but as a tradable instrument. It's clear the FEC is making the assertion that, in its view, bitcoin is not money but a ""thing of value"" such as stock or a treasury bond. Lee Goodman, the vice chairman of the FEC said:  “The CAF does not need our permission to accept in-kind contribution of things of value, including bitcoins.”  He continued: ""I think the legal question for the FEC is quite vanilla. The legal analysis starts with the clear and unambiguous statutory right that Mr Backer’s client has to give and receive contributions. There’s no debate about that. Contributions are defined as anything of value.”  “Bitcoins clearly are things of value to many people. They have purchasing value, they have trading value. They have US dollar exchange value. That makes bitcoins, in my mind, no different from any other in-kind contribution that political committees can give or receive today.”  He added: “There are any number of things of value that are like these bitcoins, and we have quite easily adapted our regulatory regime to regulate them. Many treasury bonds now are nothing more than an electronic transfer with an account number on them.”  Anonymity  However, as a result of this, CAF may not use bitcoins for disbursements (bitcoin being a thing of value and not cash money). Instead, CAF must sell its bitcoins and deposit the proceeds in a registered bank account in order to use them. That distinction is important, since the FEC is very concerned about anonymous political donations.  “Bitcoins are zipped electronically over the internet, from one bitcoin wallet to another bitcoin wallet. And There is concern that somehow that gives rise to potential anonymity and false reporting of the donor,” said Goodman.  It's clear that the FEC's job is to make sure that it can keep track of political donations, a serious concern for them regarding the usage of bitcoin.  “Congress, when it enacted the FEC, put in very low limits on donations that come in anonymously and donations that come in as cash. [Bitcoin] seems to share some of those features,” Weintraub commented.  According to commission member Matthew Petersen, the question of anonymity still remains an issue once a political group has received bitcoin. He noted that all four draft opinions on the subject deem the acceptance of BTC as fine, but the disbursement was another issue altogether. He said:  “All the drafts would allow the CAF to receive bitcoins as in-kind contributions, and then [the] question was, what could they do with them at that point?”  What happens next?  In the end, a motion to vote on one of the advisory opinions, Agenda Document No. 13-45-B (Draft D), failed to pass, with the votes split 3-3.  The cause can be attributed to some of the FEC's leaders, who highlighed the need for more time and information during the hearing. Each member discussed the amount of consideration virtual currencies such as bitcoin take to fully understand, given the precarious circumstances of something like campaign finance law.  It's possible that the FEC could reach some kind of temporary consensus before the end of the year. One proposed solution was to draft an advisory opinion that everyone could agree on, then allow it to expire at some point in the near future. One of the issues is that bitcoin's status as a 'thing of value' could be problematic given ""potential problems because of the volatility"", according to FEC member Caroline Hunter.  Weintraub, the chairwoman, suggested at the hearing that the FEC could ""try and craft an interim policy” by the end of the year. Ultimately, the major concern now is that rules are put in place for the anonymity issues that surround bitcoin.  “We have a statue that requires transparency,” she said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/26/us-federal-elections-commission-bitcoin-isnt-money,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ba4e659768e4f5f4f8e6d0eac4d0bd30a4cf82c2-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425128,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHsrFh,1385476809,Wagepoint's Bitcoin Payroll Service Hits Canada Next Week,"It's official, bitcoin-based payroll is coming to North America. Online payroll management firm Wagepoint is planning to integrate the feature into its product for Canadians next Monday, with a US rollout expected in January.  Virtex's role  The Halifax-based company is working with incumbent Canadian exchange Virtex to transfer payments into bitcoins for its customers’ employees.  Employees must set up a bitcoin wallet themselves (employers cannot do this for them) and tell the system how much of their net pay they want converted into bitcoins. Wagepoint then converts this amount via Virtex at the exchange’s current ask price.  Bitcoins will hit employee wallets once the payroll has been processed. Any tax deductions will be handled before the bitcoins are converted, meaning that the employee will only receive bitcoins from their net pay.  In theory, this avoids any potential tax hurdles further down the line, should the Canadian Revenue Agency revisit its rules on taxation. Earlier this month, the CRA reaffirmed its original position on bitcoin, which was to treat it as a barter transaction.  Advantages for employees  One of the advantages for Canadians who want to receive bitcoins in this way is that they’ll get a better rate.  Virtex normally charges 1.5% on transactions less than 400 BTC in a 30-day period. Employees accepting bitcoin payments via Wagepoint will be charged a 1% fee. Virtex normally requires an exchange of 1,200 BTC to 1,600 BTC – that’s at least $1m at the time of writing – to give that rate.  According to reportshttp://www.progressmedia.ca/article/2013/10/wagepoint-pay-processes-40-million-canadian-payroll, Wagepoint Pay has processed $40m in payroll since launching in July.  Additionally, Virtex has introduced a debit card that can be used to spend bitcoins by converting them to dollars automatically at an ATM or point of sale. However, this service requires people to own a Virtex account, rather than a third-party wallet.  Leema Thampan, Wagepoint's chief marketing officer, hopes to promote the feature primarily to merchants who already accept bitcoin payments, she commented: “As they are already comfortable with the concept, they will be likely to consider a payroll solution that supports bitcoin to pay their own employees.”  Risks for employees  This focus on companies that already take bitcoin could mitigate another risk – the uneducated employee. Bitcoin is notoriously volatile, thanks to a market that still lacks liquidity. Indeed, speakers at Tuesday’s banking Senate hearing even suggested it was closer to a commodity than a currency because it tracked currency so poorly. Thampan commented:  “We expect employees who set up a bitcoin wallet to understand the implications of their decision, given the volatile nature of bitcoin. We are simply enabling them [...] to buy bitcoin at the time they get paid.”  Thampan added that the company would not provide advice to employees about bitcoin, saying: “Employees are definitely taking a risk when accepting payment in bitcoin, but it is no different than employees making decisions to invest their money in stock options.”  The firm will be rolling out a similar US-based service in January with an undisclosed US bitcoin exchange. US company Coinvoice already provides an invoicing system for freelancers and contractors who wish to invoice in US dollars and get paid in bitcoins.

42425138,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHsrZh,1385469393,BitWasp Aims to Make Online Bitcoin Acceptance Easier,"Looking to build on bitcoin's merchant and auction shopping economy, BitWasp is a new software platform that allows entrepreneurs to get bitcoin merchant businesses off the ground.  “BitWasp is a totally free and open-source bitcoin marketplace that uses strong encryption – allowing administrators, vendors, and buyers to trade services and products anonymously or otherwise,” BitWasp's founders, Cameron Ruggles and Thomas Kerin, told CoinDesk.  “It is really all about giving privacy and power back to the individual who wishes to buy or sell online,"" they added.  The platform offers a number of security features, many of which will be familiar to those who embrace encryption. The pair commented:    “Users can upload a GPG public key so that other users can securely communicate with them. Client-side JS encryption is built in if users have javascript enabled, and we use RSA on top of this.      We also use two-factor GPG authentication to secure user accounts.""    BitWasp also has its own wallet software, which means that someone could use it without a third-party bitcoin payment processor such as Coinbase or BitPay. There are a number of features within the platform’s wallet configuration that are designed to mitigate a live wallet theft.  The founders commented: “Live wallets are a huge target for attackers, so we have settings which allow administrators to send funds to an offline wallet if the live wallet ever exceeds a specific balance.”  Online bitcoin marketplaces, particularly those that use escrow systems to hold payments, have been under scrutiny lately. One such service, Bitmit, recently put itself up for sale after experiencing a theft. BitWasp does offer an escrow feature on its platform, although it is up to merchants to be licensed for escrow or not. Ruggles and Kerin said:  “At present, we include an escrow feature, whereby the admin effectively has access to the funds. Most of these funds are kept in an offline wallet, which the admin tops up from time to time.”  The project also comes with built-in support for CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index, which aggregates pricing across a number of exchanges to formulate value.  BitWasp is still in the early stages of development. That being said, it is open-source and the code can be obtained on GitHub. There is also a BitWasp developers forum where enthusiasts can congregate. Those interested in using BitWasp, or any other bitcoin company, are advised to do their own research before committing funds.  BitWasp's founders believe bitcoin is a way to avoid the hassle of payment processors, allowing merchants to accept electronic money with no fees whatsoever. “It is cheaper, more secure [and] easier to use than any other payment processor,” they said.

42425134,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHsrRh,1385466038,Plug and Play to Host Event With Bitcoin Leaders and Startups,"The Plug and Play Tech Center, yet another accelerator program, is searching for bitcoin-related startups in Silicon Valley, with ambitions to fund bitcoin startups all over the globe.  The company, which brands itself as a “global accelerator”, is holding its Expo Winter 2013 conference on 5th December. The half-day event will feature a number of bitcoin and financial technology (or 'fintech') startups, which are expected to pitch to investors at the event.  Panelists  There will also be a panel featuring a number of members that are well known representatives of the bitcoin economy, including David Johnston, the executive director of venture capital firm BitAngels; Chris Larsen, the CEO of payment network Ripple; and Vinny Lingham, the CEO of Gyft. A full schedule and rundown of the panelists is located here.  Scott Robinson, who is leading the Expo as well as the bitcoin accelerator for Plug and Play, says that at least eight bitcoin startups will be pitching their business plans at the event. Robinson told CoinDesk: “We are looking for the next killer app for bitcoin.”  Startups  In 2014, Plug and Play is planning to invest in at least 10 bitcoin startups with a total of $250,000 for the year. Robinson said Plug and Play’s interest in bitcoin happened quickly and was the result of Plug and Play's founder, Saeed Amidi, seeing bitcoin's vast potential during the local Silicon Valley Bitcoin Meetup Group.  Robinson is helping to facilitate that meeting now, which counts over 330 members and meets at Plug and Play’s offices.  ""He wasn’t particularly interested in bitcoin at first,” said Robinson of Amidi’s level of enthusiasm, “but the meetup caught his attention. Charlie Lee spoke, as did two or three other speakers.”  Charlie Lee is the founder of the decentralized virtual currency litecoin. He recently left his job working on Chrome projects for Google to join bitcoin wallet and payment processor Coinbase.  Investor interest  Investment fervor in bitcoin-related businesses has spiked recently with some large backings. This includes itBit, a Singapore-based company that is planning to build a NASDAQ-style bitcoin exchange and has obtained a total of $5.5m in funding to execute that strategy.  Plug and Play isn’t the first accelerator to accept bitcoin startups. That title would go to Boost VC, an incubator in San Mateo which included seven BTC startups in its last class. However, Plug and Play is a bit different: the firm has a global approach, and works with partners in locales including Singapore, Berlin, Vancouver and Mexico City to incubate and build new businesses.  With 200 startups in its portfolio, bitcoin won’t become a big part of its strategy anytime soon. But Robinson, who just returned to California after attending Bitcoin Singapore 2013, is laying the groundwork for bigger things by “facilitating meet ups and growing connections all over the world,” he said.  A listing of the exact bitcoin and fintech companies that will pitch to the estimated 100 investors at Winter Expo 2013 has not yet been finalised. Startups in the space are still being encouraged to apply on the Plug and Play website.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | LTC,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/26/plug-and-play-to-host-event-with-bitcoin-leaders-and-startups,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b049b191b2266379d05cbcf013915ae0d440feee-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425140,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHsrXh,1385461844,KnCMiner Launches Neptune ASIC Bitcoin Miner With at Least 3TH of Power,"KnCMiner will today announce Neptune, its next-generation product: an ASIC bitcoin miner using 20nm chips that will provide at least 3TH of power.  The new boxes, which will ship “end of winter/early spring”, according to co-founder Sam Cole, will offer 0.7 watts per GH/sec. That represents a 30% power saving on its current generation of 28nm chips, he said.  KnCMiner’s  marketing model is conservative. It publishes nominal specifications for its devices ahead of time, with the caveat that these will probably be at the low end, and that real-world performance will be higher. It promised 400GH/sec for its 28nm Jupiter device, which eventually delivered 550-576GH/sec.  Under-promise, over-deliver  Cole is taking the same approach with the new box, saying that its 3TH performance is a minimum figure. He is also questioning the competition’s ability to deliver the performance promised with their 28nm boxes.  HashFast’s last update (at the time of writing) showed it had received silicon wafers with its circuitry (specced at under 0.65 watts per GH/sec) etched on them, and yet it originally promised shipments by late last month.  Cointerra said it had taped out its chips earlier in the month. HashFast is promising 1.2TH/sec per box for $6,300, while Cointerra is promising 2TH/sec for $5,999 (formerly $13,999). Cole said:  “We are going to be better than the existing competition in two ways. More performance, and we will actually deliver.”  This box – the price of which hasn’t yet been revealed – will come with a caveat, though. Cole believes that residential power supplies in some households won’t be able to handle it on a single fuse. “American houses don’t have the same supply as Sweden or Germany for example,” he said.  “The issue is that we are getting very close to the limit of the household supply in our next generation,” he said. “So the bottleneck has become the house.” This will probably be one of the firm’s last retail products, he added.  All boxes would ship with broadly the same configuration, he said, although there may be some tweaks available on the site’s pre-ordering system.  Some North American users might not be able to use the full power of the boxes unless they run electrical supply from different fuses.  “Maybe a European house can run six chips and a US house less chips,” he said, adding that chips would turn on automatically as more power became available to the box.  This sounds counterintuitive – lower process nodes are supposed to draw less power on a per-chip basis, not more. But Cole argues that while the chips draw less power, they will be able to “squeeze more cores” into the box.  The firm will engineer more silicon onto a board to improve the overall performance of its mining product.  Fabrication and delivery  The 20nm chips will be fabricated by the firm’s current ASIC fabrication partner, TSMC. He said that the non-recurring engineering (NRE) cost for the chips would be around three times that of the 28nm device (this came in with a total NRE of $4.7m, although not all of those costs were attributable to TSMC).  These are bold claims in a bitcoin mining market already struggling to make profits as difficulty skyrockets.  But KnCMiner does have a good track record up its sleeve. The company delivered its first-generation products to schedule. He added:  “We have taken over $30m in orders and continue to grow in this amazing field. We now have over 35 people in our team and still have eight positions left to fill.”  The company has also succeeded where others have struggled in the hosted mining market.  KnCMiner has its own hosting operation, while Coinlab-funded hosted mining firm Alydian is in bankruptcy. Cole suggests that KncMiner’s hosted operation could be a good option considering the expected high electrical draw of the 20nm boxes.  Existing customers will get a discount on the boxes, and they will also receive their products around two or three weeks earlier than the competition. There will be no trade-in program.  Pre-orders open today, Cole said, adding that all specifications given to CoinDesk are pre-release and subject to change.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/26/kncminer-launches-neptune-asic-bitcoin-miner-with-at-least-3th-of-power,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/20b3d4b4f1da6908aca9ac832ff74fcfa1fc20c3-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425135,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHsrVh,1385460660,Data Storage Startup Datashell Only Accepts Bitcoins,"Datashell  , a new web storage company, has announced that it will only accept payment in bitcoin, in response to a high demand from its users.  The Brighton-based company launched its web storage application this month, initially accepting both fiat currency and bitcoin. According to David Wright, a Datashell investor, 50 local businesses have already signed up as customers.  Wright said that two of Datashell's customers have paid in bitcoin; the rest used fiat currency. The company has since switched to accepting bitcoins only, but Wright added that Datashell might be forced to abandon its bitcoin-only payment policy if it can't get enough customers. He said:  ""We're being a bit fundamentalist at the moment, but if we can't make a living doing this, we're going to default back to PayPal at some point.""  Datashell is a backup and storage service with features similar to Dropbox. Its current price plans are aimed at small businesses, offering two annual subscription plans costing 0.10 BTC and 0.28 BTC. Datashell claims that both plans come with ""unlimited"" storage, although the cheaper plan will only back up data on five connected machines. The more expensive plan offers users unlimited connections.  Several redditors have expressed skepticism over Datashell's claim that it will back up unlimited amounts of data. For example, redditor 16rjg4 posted:  ""So I can back up 30 versions of the entire internet on this service, for 0.3 BTC/year? Someone should tell archive.org!""  Datashell's terms and conditions (pdf) state that unlimited storage will be offered as long as the data is also present on the customer's own machine. Wright, the Datashell investor, said that the company will honour its claim to offer unlimited storage.  ""We're confident that should someone turn up with 5TB to backup, we can cover it,"" Wright said.  Dropbox and bitcoin  In May, Dropbox users mounted an unsuccessful campaign to get the web storage startup to accept bitcoin payments. They rallied around a call to vote for bitcoin payments at Votebox, the company's official feature request channel. Users could cast votes for feature ideas they liked at Votebox. The request to buy storage with bitcoins eventually reached the top of the list.  However, in October Dropbox closed Votebox and moved feature requests to its user forums. The post explaining the closure said that Votebox had become ""a wasteland of unanswered requests"". Dropbox has not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication.  Dropbox users have expressed their displeasure with the company's move to shut down its Votebox channel. The top comment on the associated reddit thread reads:  ""F*** Dropbox. Not like they don't have plenty of competitors. Let's take our efforts, and business, elsewhere.""  Reddit users have suggested switching from Dropbox to SpiderOak, which began trialling bitcoin payments in August. SpiderOak claims to offer users a level of data privacy known as 'zero-knowledge' which means that the data it stores is only readable by its customers.  Wright said Datashell's move to take bitcoin payments was partly a response to Dropbox users' demands to pay in the digital currency.  ""People had been pushing us to take bitcoin, then we found out about Dropbox [taking down Votebox], which is just crazy,"" Wright commented. ""We believe there is a market opportunity here,"" he added.  Few large web storage providers currently accept bitcoin payments. Mega, for example, began accepting bitcoins in February. Mega charges an annual fee between 0.1548 and 0.4643 BTC for storage from 500GB to 4TB.  Datashell's founders, Phil Townsend and Tim Fry, also run a tech support business called Coast Networks in Brighton. Notably, Coast Networks has also begun accepting bitcoin payments.
