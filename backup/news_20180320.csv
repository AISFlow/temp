Announced Tuesday, the app's Series A round was led by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, whose portfolio includes a variety of tech companies such as Coinbase and Airbnb, and Union Square Ventures, a New York-based firm that has stakes in Coinbase, OB1 and other industry startups.  Still, the news is a milestone for the ethereum-based app, which has enjoyed tremendous popularity since its launch in December 2017. CryptoKitties allows users to buy, collect, breed and exchange unique digital cats built on ERC-721 tokens, and users have done so, even congesting the ethereum network and delaying token sales due to demand.  A spokesperson for Axiom Zen said CryptoKitties, which will retain at least 20 employees, aims to ""make blockchain technology accessible and relevant to everyday consumers,"" and believes ""digital collectibles can act as a constellation for identity and self-expression.""  ""They can be wonderfully representative of who we are and what's important to us,"" the representative told CoinDesk in an email, adding that the people behind CryptoKitties believe ""the world in the future will involve reputation-based identity powered by the blockchain.""  Axiom Zen's spokesperson said the proceeds will primarily be used to ""dramatically expand"" the CryptoKitties team ""as we figure out how to scale the blockchain to a billion consumers.""  Token Summit founder and advisor to Coin Center William Mougayar, who is an angel investor in company, told CoinDesk he thought the app could be a leader in what will turn out to be ""the year of native digital assets on the blockchain.""  ""The team and the company behind CryptoKitties are in a leading mindshare position and capable of increasing their market share in the consumer gaming sector,"" he said.  Axiom Zen said in its announcement that its other angel investors include Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam, AngelList founder Naval Ravikant and Zynga founder Mark Pincus, in addition to senior figures at BitFury, Y Combinator, Tinder, Earn.com, Lending Home, Compound VC and Entrepid.  Likewise, the company noted that it had obtained seed funding from the Digital Currency Group, YesVC, Version One and CAA Ventures.  Going forward the firm has high hopes that it can turn its brand of unique digital items into something that can appeal to larger enterprise partners and new business.

42380499,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8fmXj,1521576000,"Maryland Bills Call for Study, Possible Regulation of Blockchain","Two bills before the Maryland legislature call for the U.S. state to study and possibly regulate blockchain technology.  House Bill 1634 and its companion Senate Bill 1068, together known as the Financial Consumer Protection Act of 2018, would mandate that the Maryland Financial Consumer Protection Commission study the technology and the space.  Afterward, the commission would “include recommendations for State actions to regulate cryptocurrencies in its 2018 report to the Governor and ... the General Assembly regarding State action to regulate cryptocurrencies.”  The bills are notable, as Maryland has generally stayed out of the cryptocurrency regulation fray. The last time a state agency discussed the topic was in 2014, when the Maryland Office of the Commissioner of Financial Regulation issued a warning to bitcoin investors.  At the time, the agency noted that cryptocurrencies were unregulated, and warned investors to do their own research before buying bitcoin or its cousins.  It also noted that state and federal regulators were working on a framework for regulating cryptocurrencies, but no regulations have appeared in Maryland in the four years since.  While the Maryland bills do not spell out what form any future regulations would take, they are part of a worldwide surge in regulatory interest in the cryptocurrency space.  Recently the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have begun more actively tamping down on initial coin offerings (ICOs) deemed fraudulent or otherwise in violation of the law.  The SEC in particular has launched a major investigation into ICOs, and though the details of that probe are murky, chairman Jay Clayton has said repeatedly that “every ICO” he has seen would meet the definition of a security.

Everipedia further announced that its network would go live after the EOS mainnet is released, though in the event there are multiple competing EOS mainnets, members of the community would be able to vote on which network Everipedia should choose.  Users should not have to share public keys or provide access to their funds to receive tokens, Everipedia said. The startup ""is committed to transparent communications and security, which is why it has chosen to proceed with this method for the airdrop.""

42380497,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8fmRR,1521571515,G20 Calls for Crypto Regulation Recommendations By July,"The world's economic leaders have set a July deadline for the first step toward unified regulation of cryptocurrency.  Speaking Tuesday after the G20 meeting of finance ministers in Buenos Aires, Argentina Central Bank chair Frederico Sturzenegger said the member nations present agreed that cryptocurrencies needed to be examined, but that more information was needed before any regulations could be proposed.  However, during the press conference, he noted that the members had a firm deadline in July for recommendations, saying:  ""In July we have to offer very concrete, very specific recommendations on, not 'what do we regulate?' but 'what is the data we need?'""  Not every nation is on board with this plan. On Monday, Brazil Central Bank president Ilan Goldfajn said cryptocurrencies will not be regulated in his country, according to news service El Cronista. The outlet further reported that Brazil would not necessarily be following the regulations outlined by the G20, on cryptocurrencies or other issues.  In the meantime, the G20 pledged to apply the standards of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) – an intergovernmental body formed to fight money laundering and terrorist financing – to cryptocurrency.  In statement released Tuesday afternoon, the G20 said:  ""We commit to implement the FATF standards as they apply to crypto-assets, look forward to the FATF review of those standards, and call on the FATF to advance global implementation. We call on international standard-setting bodies (SSBs) to continue their monitoring of crypto-assets and their risks, according to their mandates, and assess multilateral responses as needed.""  The discussions were inspired in part by calls for a closer look at cryptocurrencies by France, Germany, the U.S. and Japan over the last several months.  Central bankers and government officials have advocated taking a closer look at the impact cryptocurrencies could have on crime, investors and on the world economy. While finance officials from France and Germany said in a joint letter that cryptocurrencies ""could pose substantial risks for investors,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and an anonymous Japanese government official expressed concerns about their use in illegal activities.  However, where major regulators seem to agree is on cryptocurrency's impact on the global financial system. Bank of England head Mark Carney, who also chairs the G20's Financial Stability Board, wrote on Sunday that ""crypto-assets do not pose risks to global financial stability at this time,"" citing the relative size of the overall market cap.  Cryptocurrencies make up less than 1 percent of the global gross domestic product (GDP), he said, while credit default swaps were equal to the global GDP in 2008.  Some of the officials attending the summit called for a global set of regulations that every country would be able to enforce, but it is unclear how far discussion on possible regulations has gotten.  That being said, a public document released prior to the meeting noted that “the technology behind crypto assets has the potential to promote financial inclusion,” but noted that the impact on financial stability and potential uses in tax evasion and illegal activities needed to be understood first.  A second meeting is expected to take place tomorrow, hosted through the G20 President's office.  Editor's note: Some of the statements in this article were translated from Spanish.

Citing anonymous officials familiar with the matter, the report states that billionaires Dennis Druzhkov and Fyodor Bogorodsky advised Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro in his efforts to build the petro. Further, Time reported that ""senior advisers to the Kremlin"" oversaw the petro's development, with the support of Russian president Vladimir Putin.  The article further stated:  ""Behind the scenes, the petro was in fact a collaboration—a half-hidden joint venture between Venezuelan and Russian officials and businessmen, whose aim was to erode the power of U.S. sanctions.""

Doubling Down on Sanctions  U.S. President Donald Trump officially sanctioned the petro Monday with an executive order barring American residents from purchasing the cryptocurrency.  Maduro said this was a sign that Trump was “scared” of the petro’s supposed power, and proof that the South American nation was “on the right track.”  In an official statement, Maduro condemned the sanctions, saying they were in violation of the United Nations charter and international law, and that they were “an attack on [Venezuelan] people.”  Meanwhile, U.S. Senator Bob Menendez, who has repeatedly called for action against the petro, said he welcomed the new sanctions, but added that the ""international community must continue coordinated efforts to increase pressure on the Maduro regime.""  Similarly, Florida representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen said she, too, welcomed the sanctions, but urged ""the [Trump] Administration to continue building on this momentum and and use all available tools to increase pressure on Maduro, but we must also find a way to support the people and their humanitarian needs.""

42380494,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8fmTx,1521563455,Bermuda Drafting ICO-Friendly Legislation to Draw Crypto Businesses,"A move toward ICO regulation is underway in Bermuda, the premier of the British Overseas Territory said last Friday.  David Burt, who is also the minister of finance, provided an overview of a draft bill to the parliament's House of Assembly, saying that legislators will take a ""measured approach"" to regulating the crypto industry in order to make the island ""a global leader in the fintech space.""  ""Bermuda has an opportunity to become a global leader in the Fintech space by being one of the first countries in the world to specifically regulate ICOs,"" he said, adding:  ""The proposed regulatory framework will provide legal certainty to companies looking to conduct ICOs in Bermuda.""  The proposed bill would designate ICOs as ""restricted business activities,"" and would require issuers to obtain consent from the minister of finance before starting operations.  Burt said the application process would require the disclosure of information about the company, the digital asset being issued and ""the rights of the purchaser to assist the public in making informed decisions about participating in any proposed ICO.""  Wayne Caines, Bermuda's minister of national security, will lead the legislative initiative. The government has also formed a Legal and Regulatory Working Group that includes MP Michael Scott, who was previously the island's attorney general, officials from the Ministry of Economic Development and Tourism and the Ministry of Finance, and individuals from private sector banking and legal institutions.  Bermuda's proposed ICO legislation will not be a wholly new regulatory framework, the premier explained, and instead will take the form of amendments to the Companies Act 1981 and the Limited Liability Company Act 2016. Likewise, other existing legislation will continue to apply to ICOs where appropriate, including securities laws.  The government is also consulting with the Bermudan Monetary Authority on additional legislation dealing with digital asset companies.  By creating an environment of regulatory certainty for ICO issuers, Burt said, Bermuda could reap a range of economic benefits, including the migration of new companies, jobs and capital to the island, as well as additional government revenues.  Implementing ICO rules would also reduce the risk of cryptocurrencies being used for ""cybercrime, consumer fraud, money laundering and terrorist financing,"" he said.  The draft bill is expected to circulate soon, and following a consultation period, will be passed to parliament for deliberation ""at the earliest opportunity.""  Bermuda has been involved in the crypto space since 2017 when it launched a blockchain task force. In January of this year, Burt said at the World Economic Forum that Bermuda may use the blockchain to revamp its property deeds system.

42380479,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8fmL9,1521559812,US Treasury Publishes 5 Tips For Blockchain Projects,"The US Department of the Treasury has just published five tips for building blockchain projects.  According to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service website, the list is based on the lessons staff learned while working on a proof of concept blockchain system for tracking physical assets, such as computers or cars, which began last autumn.  After months of tinkering with distributed ledgers, the first and most important insight offered is for people to ask themselves: Is blockchain technology a good fit for this concept?  These are some of the questions the Treasury recommends using to determine if blockchain technology is central to the project:  Do you need a structured central repository of information?  Is more than one entity reading or writing transactions to a database?  Is there less than total trust between parties/entities in the ecosystem (for example, one user will not accept the “truth” as reported by another user)?  Are central gatekeepers introducing costs and /or “friction” when verifying transactions (for example, manual verification)?  Are there routine or logical interactions that occur that could be programmed to self-execute (for example, smart contracts)?  If the answer to several of those questions is yes, the next step could be interviewing a variety of different stakeholders to understand their pain points, the Treasury states. It also recommends seeking out diverse teams and documenting the entire process, to help spot weaknesses and opportunities.  The website warns, though:  “Include both blockchain skeptics and non-technical people. A team comprised of only pro-blockchain people can be blinded by the hype and force a square peg into a round hole.”  The advice concludes by advising that entrepreneurs carve out time for explaining the basics of blockchain technology to everyone from investors to lawyers. Again, this is because diverse perspectives can help teams get beyond the hype surrounding blockchain experiments.  “There is no way to sugar coat it – agency governance processes can be time-consuming,” according to the website. “Building enough time into your project plan to present and explain blockchain technology in clear, easy-to-understand terms will help you plan for, and move through the process swiftly.”  Department of the Treasury image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/03/20/us-treasury-publishes-5-tips-for-blockchain-projects,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d68531cd82f082bccf1c14e6f1481d7d0390e299-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ether Price Seeks Floor After 40% Drop,"The 40 percent month-on-month decline of ethereum's ether cryptocurrency has pushed the long-term price floor down to $300, the technical charts indicate.  As of writing, the world's second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is changing hands at $534, as per CoinMarketCaphttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/etherum/historical-data/.  Stepping back, ether's sharp reversal from the Feb. 6 low of $555 (prices as per Coinbase) and the rally to near $1,000 in the subsequent days meant the cryptocurrency had established a strong price floor below $600. That now looks to have been pushed down.  Daily chart  As seen on the chart above, ETH left lower highs around the key descending trendline, as the rally from Feb. 6 lows ran out of steam and sellers took over after the cryptocurrency fell below its 100-day moving average (MA) on March 6.  The transfer of power from bulls to bears pushed the price down to $450 on March 18 – the lowest level since Dec. 11.  During that process, the cryptocurrency also witnessed a head-and-shoulders reversal on March 14 – indicating that the rally from the December 2016 low of $5.81 has ended and the bears have regained control. Further, a 50-day MA and the 100-day MA bearish crossover was confirmed on March 15.  So, ETH will likely find acceptance below $546 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of December 2016 to January 2018 rally) and extend the drop to $300 (78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement) over the next couple of months.  View  The price floor looks to have dropped to $300.  That said, oversold conditions in the near-term may help ETH defend the March 18 low of $450.  Only a convincing move above the head-and-shoulders neckline resistance (former support now seen at $661) would abort the bearish view.  A move above $982 would signal a long-run bearish-to-bullish trend change.

42380496,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8fmYz,1521547218,Ripple's XRP Might Be the Next Big Crypto Futures Market,"Bitcoin futures may have been launched with tremendous fanfare – but XRP futures, on the other hand, not so much.  In fact, U.K.-based startup Crypto Facilities has been operating a futures market for the world's third-largest cryptocurrency, developed by blockchain startup Ripple Inc., for almost 18 months now. And while the company's CEO, Timo Schlaefer, has been tight-lipped about the product so far, he sees trends in recent data that indicate broader XRP futures adoption may be on the horizon.  ""We have pretty good order books,"" Schlaefer told CoinDesk, ""And we're in the process of working with some of the large market makers to draw that further.""  Indeed, when bitcoin was still months away from getting its first Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulated bitcoin derivatives, Schlaefer's company had quietly partnered with Ripple and launched XRP futures – its second cryptocurrency futures product after bitcoin to be regulated under the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).  Later, when Chicago commodities giants Cboe and CME Group opened their first bitcoin futures in December, Crypto Facilities' own XRP futures were trading $14.2 million in volume a month. And by the time Cboe's first bitcoin futures contract expired in January, Crypto Facilities' XRP futures had almost doubled in volume to $24.6 million.  Yet, few outside the firm's own pool of investors even knew the futures were being traded, much less with that kind of volume. Now, that appears to be changing with the company on track for another positive month, and others exploring the contracts.  ""The liquidity has been growing quite a lot,"" Schlaefer said, adding:  ""We have seen our volume growing through February and expect March to set a new record.""  Mirroring the price  While Schlaefer wouldn't reveal the identities of the large market makers the company is currently courting, data he provided exclusively to CoinDesk gives a look into how the offering has been growing – and it largely mirrors the price of XRP itself.  For instance, the volume of cash-settled XRP futures, which the company officially launched in October 2016, were relatively flat from month to month until March 2017.  That's when XRP futures volume more than tripled to $3.08 million and quadrupled to $12.1 million the following month. Over the same time period, the price of XRP experienced similar growth, rising from $0.03 in April to $0.34 in mid-May, before shrinking substantially.  But then again in January 2018, the volume of futures mirrored XRP's price increases, jumping to $24.6 million as the price of the cryptocurrency reached a record $3.53.  And according to Schlaefer, while the number of registered investors in XRP futures, between 2,000 and 3,000 people, seems small, he estimates that those investing in the product comprise about 30 percent of Crypto Facilities' total number of investors.  With most of those trading falling into the category of retail investors, XRP also represents a growth opportunity for the company, and Schlaefer believes, the industry at large.  ""We still want to get them a more diverse user base,"" he said. 'But it's going in the right direction.""  Continuing momentum  And there's reason to believe more products could be on the horizon.  Already, CME Group, valued at $55 billion, has set a precedent of working with Crypto Facilities in the build-up to its own bitcoin futures launch.  While a representative of CME Group declined to comment on whether the company is exploring XRP futures specifically, it participated in Ripple's $55 million Series B investment in 2016. Shortly thereafter, the former head of precious metals and metals options at CME Group also joined Ripple as its head of XRP markets.  Cboe has also been non-committal in its answers to queries. In response to CoinDesk's inquiry about XRP futures, a Cboe spokesperson reiterated statements from the company's chief executive, who last year said the exchange was open to adding additional cryptocurrency options.  But it may be startups focused on the use case that are the first to finally embrace XRP.  Paul Chou, the co-founder and CEO of LedgerX, a CFTC-regulated bitcoin derivatives provider, said his company was exploring the possibility of XRP futures. LedgerX launched the first regulated and physically-settled bitcoin derivatives product last year and has since traded $100 million in notional volume.  Future manipulation  Still, Chou hinted at reservations that could slow adoption.  For example, he said that the company's decision on whether to add XRP futures will stem primarily from its analysis of XRP's ""concentration of holdings.""  Indeed, the reason for LedgerX's concern reflects apprehension more broadly held within the cryptocurrency community about Ripple Inc. and its control over XRP. For one, Ripple's employees reportedly hold large amounts of the cryptocurrency.  As such, in response to demand from customers ""who are definitely inquiring about XRP,"" Chou said, the company established a group to investigate.  In particular, the group is looking into the potential that those that who hold large amounts of XRP could manipulate the price, especially if the futures contracts are settled in cash.  Chou concluded:  ""Physical settlement avoids those issues because you are not beholden to some abstract price that might or might not be manipulated. You either want the crypto, or you don't.""

While the stock exchange has previously announced an initiative in developing a blockchain-based private market to finance smaller enterprises, Li said technology vendors were not able to lend sufficient support and the HKEX is not interested in taking the effort in-house.  That said, Li still hopes to beef up the exchange's blockchain efforts by following the technological progress and vendor relationships seen by the ASX.  ""Let’s use this cheap technology to do something that doesn’t affect the central order book,"" he was quoted as saying.

42380498,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8fmaF,1521543029,$9K Ahead? Bitcoin Looks North After Bull Breakout,"Bitcoin (BTC) looks set to extend its two-day winning streak and could soon test the $9,000 mark, technical analysis suggests.  Over the last two days, bitcoin has retraced close to 30 percent of the recent drop from $11,660 (March 5 high) to $7,335 (March 18 high). Further, the cryptocurrency also witnessed an upside break of the key descending trendline yesterday. So, it appears the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has bottomed out for the short-term.  However, despite the bull flag breakout, the cryptocurrency has been restricted to a narrow range of $8,200–$8,700 for the better part of the last 20 hours.  Trading volume in the last 48 hours has stayed around the monthly average of $6.64 billion, as per CoinMarketCap, which is a slight cause for concern. A big rise in the trading volumes would have meant the recovery in BTC is backed by strong hands.  Still, the price chart analysis indicates BTC is possibly a building base around $8,200 for the next move higher towards $9,000.  As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $8,448, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). The global average price, as calculated by CoinMarketCap stands at $8,498 – up 2.8 percent in the last 24 hours.  Daily chart  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows:  Short-term bulls reversal as indicated by Sunday's bullish hammer and Monday's positive follow-through.  BTC closed (as per UTC) above the 10-day moving average (MA) on Monday, indicating scope for short-term consolidation with a positive bias.  Both the 5-day MA and 10-day MA have bottomed out (shed bearish bias).  Major resistance is seen at $9,157 (200-day moving average) and major support is seen at $7,665 (March 15 low) and $7,240 (March 18 low).  4-hour chart  The bullish RSI divergence followed by an upside break of the falling wedge further adds credence to the short-term bullish reversal as seen in the daily chart. Also, the 10-MA is biased to the bulls.  View  BTC will likely test $9,000 (psychological hurdle) and $9,157 (200-day MA) in the next 24–36 hours.  A daily close above the 200-day MA would open the doors for $10,000. Currently, further gains are ruled out, as suggested by the bearish weekly chart.  On the downside, a move back inside the falling wedge would signal bullish invalidation.  A daily close (as per UTC) below $7,240 (March 18 low) would revive the bearish outlook.

As reported by CoinDesk, U.S. president Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday prohibiting American citizens and residents from purchasing or transacting in digital currencies issued by Venezuela.  Diosdado Cabello, vice president of Venezuela's United Socialist Party, decried the move on Twitter, saying:  ""Once again, imperialism is wrong in announcing sanctions and blockades against the brave and dignified Venezuelan people, the sell-out lackeys drool when our people suffer. Let's raise the flags of Bolivar and Chavez, we will win!!""  According to Prensa Latina, the official state news agency of Cuba, Cabello also commented on the sanctions at a press conference in Venezuela's capital, Caracas, Tuesday.  He reportedly remarked that President Trump and the U.S. have failed to take a diplomatic path over its political dispute with Venezuela, and instead have opted for a ""warlike"" approach.  The news comes just before the public ICO of the petro token, which is expected to kick off Monday, according to the white paper. That follows the closed pre-sale which ran from Feb. 20 to March 19.  Since the launch of the petro pre-sale, Venezuela's president, Nicolas Maduro, has claimed the token has raked in up to $5 billion, though no evidence has been presented to back up the claim.  Maduro announced the cryptocurrency in December 2017, and it was quickly condemned by U.S. officials as a means to evade international sanctions.

It's safe to say Assemblyman Ron Kim has high hopes for his newly proposed New York law, Bill A9899. Submitted to the state legislature in February, Kim's legislation takes aim squarely at the so-called ""BitLicense,"" the much-maligned regulatory regime now imposed on crypto startups serving the fourth most populous U.S. state.  In interview with CoinDesk, Kim went so far as to state his goal is to clear a path for startups, eliminating some of the more controversial components of the law, while preserving those he believes can help protect consumers.  “It would get rid of the fee and the actual license itself,"" he explained. ""We want to embrace the startup companies that are trying to launch exchanges.”  Such a change would no doubt be welcome by the startup community, including those that have struggled to work within the confines of the BitLicense. Those tensions were on display during a public forum held in February by two state senators who are planning a piece of reform legislation of their own.  To date, only a handful of companies have managed to acquire a BitLicense since 2015. (In fact, the bill's five backers – four co-sponsors and one multi-sponsor according to public records –might outnumber the companies that have been approved).  Still, it's not entirely clear if and when the bill would become law. Kim said he hopes the bill will start the long road this summer, although it could take until early 2019.  Sure to win him support among the technology's enthusiasts, though, is that his argument against the BitLicense is that it puts too much power in the hands of the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and that it was approved through a unilateral process.  ""As of now, one person, the superintendent from one state government agency, has way too much power over the current regulations, without any oversight, to determine which exchanges are allowed in the market,"" he told CoinDesk, adding:  ""The BitLicense, and its [regulations], were created unilaterally through the executive office without any legislative authority. That’s not the way we should treat the tech sector.""  Exchange focus  That said, Kim's bill calls for a range of requirements on companies that offer exchange services for cryptocurrencies, including mandates on cybersecurity and record-keeping.  This includes requiring exchanges to appoint a third-party depository to safeguard against fraud, bookkeeping errors, hacking, money laundering ""and all sorts of things,"" he explained.  ""It's more of a monitor system than actually holding an actual amount of money,"" he said.  The bill would also require exchanges use some kind of insurance, similar to other financial institutions, to ensure accounting records are transparent and independently verified.  So far, Kim says he is working with stakeholders like Bernard Moon, co-founder of the investment fund SparkLabs, and Crypto Working Group’s chief economist Richie Hecker, who heads up a network focused on best practices for the emerging industry.  He added that he is still open to feedback from more industry experts as the process moves forward.  Ultimately, Kim said he wants to create a more accommodative environment for cryptocurrency startups – and that doing so could open up new forms of revenue for the state if exchanges start opening up shop there.  ""There's a tremendous opportunity, as the financial capital of the world, to take a leadership role,"" he told CoinDesk, concluding:  'There are so many people interested in getting involved, with cryptocurrency, for the right reasons that I envision a whole new revenue stream that would help the state of New York.""

42380492,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8fmVD,1521520234,Olympic Medalist Apolo Ohno Has a Problem with Crypto,"It's time to grow up.  At least that's the message Apolo Ohno, eight-time U.S. Olympic medalist and the founder of a new cryptocurrency exchange called Hybrid Block, has for the industry. While the speed skating champion is so confident he sees cryptocurrency as a ""long-term play,"" he believes the state of global exchange ecosystem he's entering is a mess to say the least.  Not only are there issues that need to be resolved before the industry hits its next wave of maturity – education, transparency, liquidity and regulation – there's also rampant fraud.  Speaking at the Blockchain Unbound conference in Puerto Rico last week, Ohno signaled out wash trading – or the practice of buying and selling the same financial instrument to create artificial volume – as rampant. Not only is it practiced by individual investors, he claimed it's even done by individual exchanges that are cheating their customers.  But while wash trading is an illegal activity in more traditional markets, without a firm regulatory structure for the cryptocurrency markets, many partake in it, Ohno said.  ""The amount of wash trading and front-running … you'd probably be very scared to keep any money in cryptocurrency,"" he said.  Still, that's something that Ohno has set his sights on changing, and in his talk, he put forward the idea the challenges could be solved with collaboration and discipline.  He told the audience:  ""I want people to know what they're buying and why they're getting involved.  Bad reputations  In one of his first public speeches on the subject, Ohno didn't pull punches either, discussing the names of specific exchanges he believes are operating correctly.  Indeed in one monologue, Ohno compared the volume seen at the U.S. exchange Gemini with those of international exchanges. While volume is generally higher abroad, Ohno said, he believes that Gemini's volume is likely to be reflective of real trading.  Elsewhere, Ohno shared the stage with Alex Wearn, the CEO of decentralized exchange Aurora, and Biser Dimitrov, the technical director at BlockEx, which provides a platform for cryptocurrency exchanges, and both agreed wash trading is a problem for the industry.  ""There are some exchanges out there that have bad reputations … but people are making money so they're hesitant to call them on it,"" Wearn said.  But if Ohno's statements seemed to focus on offering advice to potential entrepreneurs, he was quick to note that he doesn't see crypto as a competitive sport.  ""We're so early in the industry that we're so collaborative,"" he said, adding:  ""Think about how many people in the world don't own cryptocurrency.""  Decentralizing the exchange  Still, Ohno was also insistent that coming regulation will do much to shape that landscape.  With rumors flying about a large-scale probe by the SEC into initial coin offerings (ICOs) and the exchanges that offer them, regulation was a hot topic during many panels at the conference.  While Ohno said that regulation is needed to a certain degree, he does worry that U.S. regulators could stifle innovation. In an effort to stop regulators from pursuing a cumbersome regulatory framework, Ohno said that the industry should seek to self-regulate.  But, he's still confident the technology can prevail even in that disaster situation. Ohno not only is focusing on the Asian market – ""If you're not targeting Asia, you're missing out,"" he said – he's also interested in high-tech alternatives to today's offerings.  ""If shit really hits the fan, we've got these decentralized exchanges you can't shut them down,"" he added.  Overall, while it's still a work in progress, Ohno believes there's still time.  ""We live in a sphere that's so small. Our voices are growing and becoming stronger, but if my dad and our parents don't know what [cryptocurrency] is, then we're not at mass adoption,"" Ohno said, adding:  ""And we need [mass adoption] if you want to make a true impact.""

42380488,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8fmMP,1521516902,"DOJ, SEC Argue Vague Laws No Excuse for ICO Fraud","The U.S. government is pushing back against an effort to dismiss the charges it filed in an ongoing initial coin offering (ICO) fraud lawsuit.  In twin filings submitted Monday, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dismissed claims by defendant Maksim Zaslavskiy that U.S. securities laws don't apply to the sale of tokens tied to two ventures, one backed by real estate and the other by diamond holdings.  Zaslavskiy – who has pled not guilty to securities fraud – was first charged by the SEC last September, followed by additional charges sought by the Justice Department in November. The SEC case against Zaslavskiy has been put on hold pending the outcome of DOJ's suit.  The filings are notable given the growing footprint of the U.S. government – and the SEC in particular – in the cryptocurrency space. The SEC has adopted an increasingly active approach since it first publicly declared that tokens issued in conjunction with The DAO, the now-defunct ethereum-based funding vehicle, were securities.  And just last week, a senior official with the SEC's Enforcement Division disclosed during an event appearance that the agency is conducting ""dozens"" of investigations in this area.  At the heart of Zaslavskiy's push to dismiss the charges is the argument that the two tokens in question aren't actually securities under U.S. law, which he argued is too vague, and are currencies instead. Prosecutors pushed back against this claim, stating that the both the RECoin and Diamond token fall squarely within the boundaries of the Howey Test.  ""Now facing prosecution for securities fraud, the defendant claims that his 'investment opportunity' was no investment at all—it was just a sale of a currency backed by a commodity, first real estate (REcoin) and then diamonds (Diamond),"" the U.S. government's lawyers wrote. ""The currency, according to the defendant, are the worthless certificates sent to investors that prompted some to ask for refunds.""  They went on to argue:  ""[Zaslavskiy] also claims that securities laws have not provided him with fair notice that his conduct was unlawful, despite having told his investors that he was in 'full compliance' with the law. The defendant’s arguments do not hold water in light of the allegations in the indictment and controlling law. Accordingly, his motion should be denied.""  'Vagueness' no excuse  The Department of Justice's filing strikes a decidedly dismissive tone toward the argument that SEC regulations aren't clear enough when it comes to the question of cryptocurrencies and ICOs.  Indeed, both of the filings are accompanied by copies of some of the statements issued in recent months by the U.S. securities regulator  ""The defendant invites this Court to be the first to declare the Securities Acts unconstitutionally vague (either facially or as-applied),"" the DOJ's filing quipped.  Notably, the government argued that Zaslavskiy knew what he was doing when he began soliciting investments for both token sales, writing that he “had more than sufficient notice that this conduct constituted securities fraud.”  ""What is more, there is evidence that the defendant was, in fact, on notice that he was subject to the securities laws,"" the government wrote, going on to add that one investor in the RECoin ICO had asked about compliance and had been told ""in sum and substance that the investor had nothing to worry about with respect to legal compliance.""  ""The SEC also contacted the defendant as early as August 15, 2017 requesting information about the REcoin ICO. The defendant wrote that he planned to hire an attorney, but instead proceeded with the Diamond ICO,"" the filing continued.

42401310,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcXzLx,1521507602,Theranos Fraud Holds Harsh Lessons for Crypto,"Marc Hochstein is the managing editor of CoinDesk.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      ""Innovators who seek to revolutionize and disrupt an industry must tell investors the truth about what their technology can do today, not just what they hope it might do someday.""  That quote, from the director of the SEC's San Francisco office, Jina Choi, referred to Theranos, the blood-test company and one-time Silicon Valley darling that the agency charged with fraud last week.  But you could be forgiven for thinking it was about the cryptocurrency space, given the frenzied fundraising through initial coin offerings (ICOs) for projects with little more than grand visions, a buggy prototype, zero users and plenty of speculators betting it can work.  To be sure, a cryptocurrency is not equity in a business (at least, it's not supposed to be), and an open-source project is not the same thing as a company. But the Theranos case, in which founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes paid a $500,000 fine and was barred from serving as a public company executive or director for 10 years, offers several sobering lessons for the blockchain community.  Some of them may seem obvious, but they bear repeating. The first two apply to investors:  DYOR  For those who don't spend their days on crypto Twitter, that stands for ""do your own research.""  You know how Google Ventures figured out it didn't want to invest in Theranos? According to an investigative article published in Vanity Fair in 2016, Google's venture capital arm sent one of its associates to Walgreens, the pharmacy chain that had a partnership with the startup.  Supposedly, the ""wellness centers"" Theranos had set up in the stores were showcasing the company's technology, which it claimed could test for hundreds of diseases just by taking a tiny bit of blood from the fingertip. But, according to Nick Bilton's expose, ""as the VC sat in a chair and had several large vials of blood drawn from his arm, far more than a pinprick, it became apparent that something was amiss with Theranos’s promise.""  It would later turn out that Theranos was using its vaunted Edison machine in only a sliver of the tests it sold to consumers.  What's the crypto equivalent of ""just go down to Walgreens and see what's up?"" Well, if a blockchain network is up and running, you can start by buying a tiny amount of a coin, downloading the software and playing around with it to see if the thing works as advertised.  That's how I figured out bitcoin was legit early on, and if the cryptocurrency you're looking at is anything like bitcoin, you won't have to buy a whole unit (and if you do, well that’s a red flag right there). Better to blow $50 on initial due diligence than $10,000 on someone's assurances.  However, that ""try it yourself"" approach may not be sufficient if, say, the network is running on a small number of nodes manually controlled by the development team, with a promise to eventually take off the training wheels. And for a token sale that's funding a yet-to-be-built blockchain, one that theoretically could do awesome things in the future...well, the homework is going to be a lot more involved.  Ignore charisma  Holmes' Steve Jobs-style turtlenecks, Stanford-dropout backstory and change-the-world rhetoric made for great magazine copy. And like her idol Jobs, Holmes was reportedly secretive and imperious, largely forbidding even Theranos employees from communicating with each other about their activities.  Unlike the iPhone or the Mac, however, Theranos' devices didn't work the way Holmes led investors and patients to believe.  You would think that in cryptocurrency, a field whose own founder (or founders) remain unknown and where decentralization is one of the highest ideals, cults of personality wouldn't be much of an issue. But then there was Josh Garza. So don't pin your investment decisions on a single charismatic individual.  Of course, just because someone is charming doesn't mean they're a fraud, either. It just has little relevance to the merit of the project. Until some future time when we're all disembodied brains, we have to learn to discount these superficial distractions.  (On a related note, ignore ""gravitas."" Theranos' board included two former secretaries of state, a former secretary of defense, a retired Marine general and two former senators. Lots of gravitas. Not a whole lot of medical expertise, though. It was perhaps a more highbrow version of the celebrity-endorsed ICO phenomenon.)  The other two takeaways from this affair apply to token issuers, entrepreneurs and developers seeking to raise money in this space. And they may be even harder pills to swallow, as it were:  Tough tokens  Many may find it unfair that Holmes paid only a six-figure fine considering the size of the fraud ($700 million), especially in light of the harsh treatments given over the years to some crypto entrepreneurs who operated in good faith, simply because they did not ask for regulators' permission.  (Holmes did not admit or deny wrongdoing in the settlement agreement; according to the Wall Street Journal, a criminal investigation of Theranos is still ongoing.)  And it may well be unjust. But it shows the advantages of working within the system rather than outside it. Theranos paid millions for high-powered lawyers well before the government started investigating the company.  Even as a sham enterprise, it had resources to defend itself.    “You pay for things one way or the other, upfront or down the line,” said Joe Colangelo, a New Jersey entrepreneur and longtime bitcoin enthusiast.    The wheels of justice turn slowly    Coming nearly three years after cracks started to show in Theranos' facade, the SEC charges show that enforcement actions can take time. Just because the government hasn't gone after someone for possible violations doesn't mean it won't.    ""Whatever statute of limitations you think exists, it does not,"" Colangelo said. ""They will catch up to you eventually.""  Teams who thought they could ""do an ICO really fast"" because there were ""so many they can't possibly punish all of us"" were mistaken, he said.  ""You might be getting charged with crimes associated with your ICO in 2023,"" Colangelo added. ""You have to be ready to spend the next five years thinking about this.""  Ouch. That smarts worse than a needle in the arm.
