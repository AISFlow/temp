42424534,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2prhh,1633386127,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Rises Toward $50K on Hopes for US ETF Approval,"Bitcoin strengthened on Monday as buyers attempted to push the price toward $50,000 for the first time since early September. The cryptocurrency is up about 15% over the past week as traders appear to be exiting short positions.  Analysts are waiting for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve a bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETF), which could happen in a matter of weeks.  Although SEC Commissioner Gary Gensler restated his preference for a futures-backed bitcoin ETF last week (rather than a so-called spot ETF that would hold physical bitcoin), some analysts expect an approval by the regulator could spark a year-end crypto rally.  “It would still open the floodgates for institutional adoption and hopefully result in a spot-backed ETF being approved in the not-so-distant future, which would allow ordinary people to include the asset easily” in their brokerage accounts, Marcus Sotiriou, sales trader at the U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC), $49,308, +1.1%  Ether (ETH), $3,411, -1.6%  S&P 500: -1.3%  Gold: $1,767, +0.3%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.484%  Still, some traders are cautious given the ongoing regulatory crackdown on cryptocurrencies. On Sunday, Nikkei reported that Japan’s tax authorities conducted a large-scale audit of several individuals. Later this month, the U.S. Treasury Department is expected to release a stablecoin report that could recommend bank-like regulations for stablecoin issuers.  Bitcoin short covering  Technical breakouts made by some cryptocurrencies last week led to “massive short covering,” according to a FundStrat report. Breakouts occur when demand for an asset exceeds supply, causing the price to rise above a particular resistance level. For bitcoin, the recent breakout level around $46,000 suggests traders are starting to exit short positions.  “My cycle composite shows bitcoin trending up into late November/December before peaking,” Mark Newton, managing director and head of technical strategy at FundStrat wrote in a newsletter last week.  “The current weekly cycle does show the potential for weakness into spring 2022 before the next major rally,” Newton wrote. “Thus, this current rally might prove to be tactical in nature before consolidation sets in and the larger rally might begin next year.”  FundStrat has an initial BTC upside target around $52,000.  Crypto funds draw $90 million in new money  Bitcoin-focused funds have attracted new capital for three straight weeks, after a period of outflows in recent months, CoinDesk’s Lyllah Ledesma reported.  Bitcoin-focused funds took in $69 million, according to a report published Monday by CoinShares. It was the third straight week of inflows for bitcoin funds, pushing the cumulative intake over the period to $115 million and cementing a trend reversal from the prior few months when redemptions were the norm.  Crypto funds focused on Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain, saw $20 million of inflows. Alternative digital assets appeared to show waning interest.  Altcoin roundup  Axie Infinity’s AXS token hits record high: Axie Infinity’s token reached a record $153 days after the play-to-earn game announced it would distribute over $60 million worth of tokens to its early adopters and the launch of staking capabilities, reported CoinDesk’s Lyllah Ledesma. “Staking yields on AXS remained exceptionally lucrative (189% APR), even with 12.4 million AXS staked already and growing, leading to a real risk of a supply crunch for AXS,” said Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Synergia Capital. “This could result in exponential, albeit likely unsustainable, upside, and in the end leading to erratic and choppy price action.”  Fed to launch CBDC review as early as this week: The U.S. Federal Reserve is set to initiate a review of the risks and opportunities of introducing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) as early as this week, reported CoinDesk’s Jamie Crawley. Chair Jerome Powell referred to the development of a digital dollar as “critical work” last week during a U.S. Senate Banking Committee hearing, adding that it would require legislation from Congress in order to proceed.  DeFi lending protocol Compound’s woes continue as $66 million added to vulnerable contract: A faulty Compound Finance contract intended to disburse liquidity mining rewards over time was topped off with $66 million in tokens on Sunday morning, reported CoinDesk’s Andrew Thurman. About $22 million of those funds were then exploited due to the same bug that drained $80 million in tokens throughout the latter half of last week, per one DeFi developer, who told CoinDesk the remaining $44 million has now been determined to be at risk. The price of COMP has lost more than 5% in the last 24 hours and recently traded at $330.53.

42424525,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2prNh,1633385035,LUNA Hits All-Time Highs After Terra Network Upgrade,"Prices for Terra’s LUNA token have hit record highs since Saturday, after the blockchain’s highly anticipated Columbus-5 upgrade went live last Thursday.  The rally reaffirmed investors’ confidence in Terra, a base-layer blockchain project similar to the Ethereum blockchain, after some questioned whether excitement about the Columbus-5 upgrade was already priced in back in August. Terra is now the No. 11 cryptocurrency by market capitalization, valued at nearly $19 billion.  The Columbus-5 upgrade is significant for investors because it enabled the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) standard, which will let users easily transfer LUNA, the TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin, and other assets from Terra to other networks and vice versa.  “Columbus-5 is a big upgrade for Terra,” Ryan Watkins, a research analyst at Messari, told CoinDesk. IBC “will allow Terra to export TerraUSD and position it to become the de facto stablecoin of the Cosmos ecosystem.” Cosmos is an interoperability project that aims to build a network of independent blockchains communicating via IBC.  LUNA is part of an algorithmic balancing system that helps stablecoins running on Terra maintain parity with fiat currencies. At press time, LUNA was changing hands at $46.91, up 10.54% in the past 24 hours, according to Messari. The price hit a record high earlier Monday, at around $49.43.  Another significant aspect of Columbus-5 that’s driving up LUNA’s price is a change in the network’s token economics, according to crypto research firm Delphi Digital.  Previously, when UST traded above $1, users could send $1 worth of LUNA to a community pool and receive 1 UST in return – a trade that helped to bring the stablecoin’s price back in line with the U.S. dollar.  Now, instead of being transferred to a community pool, LUNA is burned whenever UST is minted. About 23.4 million LUNA tokens (worth more than $1 billion at the current price) previously sent to the community pool were burned the day of the upgrade, Delphi Digital noted in its newsletter Monday.  “The supply burn places deflationary pressure on LUNA making it increasingly scarce,” Delphi Digital said. “This was a key driver for recent price action.”",POSITIVE,LUNA,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/04/luna-hits-all-time-highs-after-terra-network-upgrade,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f87de7be271f6cec09c0c71024b29c448b179654-1400x1004.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Citing two unnamed sources “with direct knowledge of the deal,” The Information wrote that venture giant Andreessen Horowitz is leading the round.  The monster-battling game, which uses non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to reward players, had revenue of 64,933.71 ether (ETH), which was worth $220.32 million, in September. That was down from a record $342 million in August, data center Axie World shows.  But September’s figure still represents a nearly 3,000-fold year-over-year growth.  Axie Infinity raised $7.5 million in a Series A funding round that was announced in May, according to Crunchbase. That round’s lead investor was Libertus Capital, and other investors included Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, the Collaborative Fund and 500 Startups Vietnam.  In 2019 , Axie Infinity raised $1.5 million in a seed funding round that was led by mobile game publisher Animoca Brands.  Launched by blockchain video game company Sky Mavis in 2018, Axie Infinity came into the spotlight in the early third quarter of this year as yield compression in bitcoin and decentralized finance (DeFi) drove hot money into gaming and NFTs.  The game has become a significant source of income in such countries as Brazil, the Philippines, Venezuela and Vietnam. It’s become so popular in the Philippines that the government has expressed its intention to tax Axie players.  Axie Infinity’s AXS token hit a record high on Monday after Axie announced last week that it would distribute over $60 million worth of tokens to its early adopters and launch staking capabilities.

42421740,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpGhx,1633376855,You Can’t Use a Trillion-Dollar Coin,"Fine, go ahead and mint the damn trillion-dollar coin. And then hang it on the wall or put it on display as a symbol of monetary – and legal – incompetence.  Proposed by Democrat members of Congress as a solution to the U.S. debt ceiling impasse, the idea behind the coin is deceptively simple: There’s a loophole in the U.S. law allowing the Treasury Department to keep spending even after the limit on how much public debt can be incurred – the debt ceiling – has been reached.  The ploy is to use a rule that authorizes Treasury to issue a platinum coin “in accordance with such specifications, designs, varieties, quantities, denominations, and inscriptions as the Secretary, in the Secretary’s discretion, may prescribe from time to time.”  Marcelo M. Prates, a CoinDesk columnist, is a central bank lawyer and researcher.  So, yes, it’s perfectly legal for the Secretary of the Treasury to wake up one day feeling bold and instruct the U.S. Mint to create a trillion-dollar platinum coin. The debt ceiling wouldn’t be raised – only Congress can do that. Still, minting a coin is different from issuing debt, like government bonds, so the public debt wouldn’t immediately grow. Problem solved, right?  Wrong. Minting the coin is the easy part. Spending the damn coin, on the other hand, is all but impossible. Platinum coins are numismatic coins. They were first introduced in 1996 by Pub. L. 104–208, which authorized the Treasury Dept. to issue them, and, in 2000, Pub. L. 106–445 made their numismatic nature clear (image below).  Unlike regular coins, such as pennies, dimes or quarters, numismatic coins aren’t put in circulation through the Federal Reserve Banks. Instead, they’re sold to collectors either directly by the U.S. Mint or through authorized dealers. More than that, as these coins are made of precious metals and intended for collection and investment, they are usually sold for a price much higher than their face value.  The platinum coins available at the U.S. Mint, for example, have a face value of $100 but are sold for $1,545 each. So, the question is: To whom will Treasury sell the coin in order to receive in payment “real” money that could then be spent as if there were no tomorrow?  Sure, the U.S. Mint could advertise the trillion-dollar platinum coin on its website, and maybe Warren Buffett would be willing to invest $1,000,000,000,001 in this historic coin to save the U.S. government from default.  Read More: Moving on From Good-Bad Crypto Dialogue | Marcelo Prates  If Buffett doesn’t come to the rescue, things get more complicated. Proponents of the trillion-dollar coin adamantly treat this as a non-issue because they believe the Federal Reserve would have no problem in purchasing the coin and replenishing the Treasury Dept.’s account with dollars that could be immediately spent.  What they ignore is that the Fed doesn’t have the legal authority to buy anything directly from Treasury, much less numismatic coins. The only thing issued by Treasury that the U.S. central bank can legally buy is government bonds and, even so, in the open market (Section 14 of the Federal Reserve Act).  “In the open market” means that, if the Fed needs to buy or sell government securities to implement monetary policy, it has to do it in the secondary market instead of transacting directly with the Treasury Dept. As a result, the Fed only buys government securities from financial institutions, never from Treasury.  This rule exists to prevent the Fed from issuing money to finance government spending. Monetary financing, as this expedient is known, has been prohibited in most jurisdictions since the 1930s to prevent politicians from using the monetary power of central banks with little regard for fiscal responsibility or price stability.  Well, but couldn’t the Treasury Dept. simply deposit the trillion-dollar coin in its Fed account (Section 15 of the Federal Reserve Act) to increase the available balance? No, because Fed accounts only receive reserves, a type of money used for payments inside the banking system and in transactions between the banks and the Fed or Treasury.  And even if the Fed received the coin in deposit to keep it in one of its safes, the Fed would be acting like a vault only, returning the coin whenever the Treasury Dept. asked for it – perhaps the day a filthy rich patriot agreed to purchase this exquisite collector’s piece.  The trillion-dollar coin isn’t just a cute but faulty idea, it’s useless.",NEGATIVE,없음,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Marcelo M.

Also included in today’s “Post-War to Present” auction were Vaynerchuk’s physical drawings of “Gratitude Gorilla,” “’Diamond Hands’ Hen,” “’You’re Gonna Die’ Fly” and “Tremendous Tiger.”  Although these drawings marked the beginning of Vaynerchuk’s non-fungible token project, the Christie’s lots don’t actually come bundled with NFTs; these are just the pen-and-ink doodles he used as models for the image files.  Vaynerchuk said his doodle’s outselling so many prominent artists was both “uncomfortable” and “humbling.”  “It’s almost an out-of-body experience,” he told CoinDesk in an interview. “I’m less worried about me, in that equation, and more thinking about how lucky I am to be in this moment in time when the world is changing.”  Since launching VeeFriends in May, Vaynerchuk has become a prominent influencer in the NFT space. The lowest listed price for a VeeFriend remains over $50,000, and ONE37pm, one of Vaynerchuk’s media properties, has pivoted somewhat forcefully to NFT coverage.  And as with other major NFT collections (think Bored Ape Yacht Club), VeeFriends aspires to be more than a vehicle for speculation; the idea is that when you buy into a token, you’re buying into a community. Next year Vaynerchuk plans to host a conference exclusively for VeeFriends token holders.  Over the phone, he added that he also purchased a Warhol drawing, “Dollar Sign,” at today’s sale.  “It was more important to me that [VeeFriends] came from me – the provenance – than hiring a great digital artist to collab with me,” Vaynerchuk said, adding:  “I thought it made for a really cool crossover situation. And that’s exactly what happened today. There was another element that was unique to this project that other projects didn’t have, and you can’t even imagine how I feel right now that the market agreed.”  At a separate sale this morning, Christie’s auctioned off a set of 30 “Curio Cards” NFTs for 393 ETH, or around $1.3 million.",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/01/gary-vaynerchuk-doodle-outsells-warhol-pollock-neel-and-more-at-christies-auction,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5a42b11c2c31d7037f157798b838db222efa0c3a-1500x1055.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In its coverage, the bank highlighted companies from payment providers and banks to utilities to media giants.  Digital assets are a $2 trillion market with 200 million users, according to a Bank of America press release, and the sector is “too large to ignore,” a group of analysts led by Alkesh Shah wrote in a new research note.  “We believe crypto-based digital assets could form an entirely new asset class,” the analysts said, adding:  “Bitcoin is important with a market value of ~$900bn, but the digital asset ecosystem is so much more: tokens that act like operating systems, decentralized applications (DApps) without middlemen, stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to replace national currencies, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) enabling connections between creators and fans.”  Bank of America noted that venture capital investments in digital assets and blockchain technology surpassed $17 billion in the first half of 2021, “dwarfing” the $5.5 billion from the same period last year.  “This creates a new generation of companies for digital assets trading, offerings and new applications across industries, including finance, supply chain, gaming and social media. And yet we’re still in the early innings,” the analysts wrote.

Disney, iHeartMedia and Warner Music were also included for their current and potential NFT projects.  Chemicals company Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE: ADM) made the list because it uses blockchain technology to process transactions in global agricultural trade.

What Is The Bitcoin Stock-To-Flow Model? The BTC stock-to-flow (S2F in short) method is a price prediction model popularized by PlanB. S2F is based on the ratio between the stock (current supply) and the flow (annual production). It&apos;s often thought that PlanB is the creator of the S2F model itself, however, that isn&apos;t the case. The method has been used in the past for other assets like gold and silver, but PlanB was the first to implement it for Bitcoin. In this way, PlanB is the creator of the Bitcoin S2F chart, although not the core concept itself. The stock-to-flow value of an asset like BTC shows how scarce it is. The model relates this value with the price and gives a prediction based on that. Here is the latest price chart based on the S2F model for BTC: Bitcoin price according to the S2F model | Source: buybitcoinworldwide As is visible in the above chart, the method has been remarkably close to the real thing in its predictions.

The BCU plans to finish a proposal by the end of the year to amend the current legal provisions covering digital assets and establish a clear framework to regulate those activities, the entity confirmed in a statement on Friday.  The BCU will also promote a “dialogue with industry players and will continue its relationship with other regulators and international organizations in order to deepen its knowledge of their experience in the regulation and supervision of these activities.”  In 2021, the BCU created an internal working group to study instruments and operations with virtual assets using an interdisciplinary approach. As a result of this initiative, the entity developed a “conceptual framework based on the business reality of the different operations involving virtual assets, including both new activities and those that may already be covered by current regulations,” it said.  Digital assets are not legal tender like the Uruguayan peso, and were not issued and are not backed by any central bank, the BCU said.  Currently, the BCU added, the issuance and trading of digital assets do not fall within the scope of the central bank’s activities, and therefore they are not subject to specific regulation.  The BCU recommended users of the financial system and the general public “make an exhaustive evaluation of the risks they assume when operating with these instruments and to take the necessary precautions to mitigate them, taking into consideration that high returns are generally associated with high risks.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Andrés Engler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/04/central-bank-of-uruguay-establishes-work-plan-to-regulate-digital-assets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/39f20e5a57878cb77a9f005f519fc89e0fdf0e9c-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

There are decentralized exchanges like Uniswap or PancakeSwap. They work entirely on smart contracts. And to change one coin for another in these exchanges, you need the smart contract to store a sufficient number of both coins. This storage of two coins for a trading pair in a smart contract is called a liquidity pool. And the more coins are injected into this liquidity pool, the more favorable prices you can sell or buy coins through this liquidity pool. In fact, a pool of liquidity in decentralized exchanges is a DOM (Depth Of Market) in centralized exchanges.

42421734,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpGcn,1633371133,Who Really Wants Corporate NFTs?,"Last week, TikTok announced its first foray into the world of non-fungible tokens (NFT) with “TikTok Top Moments” – a set of digital collectibles tied to short videos from Bella Poarch, Grimes, Lil Nas X and others.  For the NFT business, it felt like a big deal. Crypto is fueled by social media and star power, and companies recognize the need for reputable celebrities to legitimize the technology. TikTok, already a partner of the blockchain-backed music streaming service Audius, was making its crypto ambitions clearer than ever.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Press releases went out, and business outlets dutifully wrote up the news. TikTok took out a full-page ad in The New York Times to promote it.  Notably absent from the promotional campaign were the stars themselves. Bella Poarch, who’s previously used her Instagram to promote consumer-oriented brands like Moncler and Fenty, neglected to mention the NFT.  Curtis Roach, less of a celebrity than either Nas or Poarch (he’s best known for a viral song called “Bored in the House”), did do some minor promotion, sharing a headline from a crypto news aggregator, but stopped short of tweeting about the NFTs himself.  The muted reaction from these savvy creators is a good reminder that, outside of crypto, people are still very much grossed out by the idea of NFTs.  A tweet from Variety about Lil Nas X’s involvement garnered about 1,000 likes and 7,000 quote tweets, the vast majority of which expressed disapproval. Among the perennially online, this is what’s known as a “ratio.”  “Noo Lil Nas X don’t become an NFT shill, you’re so sexy aha,” tweeted one account.  Another quoted the infamous Twitter comedian @dril: “The only NFTs I deal in are nerds in the F**king trashcan. S**k my d**k.”  For many fans, NFTs are still tainted by their association with energy-intensive proof-of-work blockchains (TikTok says its NFTs are “carbon neutral,” though CoinDesk has confirmed that they’re interoperable with Ethereum, which is not), and with an industry that’s seen as a home for grifters and accelerationists.  Lil Nas X is one of today’s most artful promoters. He has a gift for turning even the most cynical corporate partnerships into goofy posts on social media: When Taco Bell named him its “Chief Impact Officer,” Nas somehow found a way to metabolize it.  That Nas couldn’t spin some ironic joke out of his NFT partnership suggests the subject was too hot to touch, even for him.  The critic Dean Kissick has said that part of the ick-factor has to do with the idea of artists “shilling themselves.” NFTs are not, as an influential venture capitalist once proposed, a “grassroots movement, led by creators.” People can see through that. The industry is flush with cash, and it’s difficult to blame artists for passing up an opportunity to capitalize on their work – but “doing NFTs” still involves a certain amount of reputational risk.  Some of the loudest voices in crypto believe NFTs will “eat the world.” But the industry needs to do some serious rebranding first.  Read more: The Problem of Authenticity in NFT Art – The Node  The Ethereum network’s impending shift to a proof-of-stake blockchain – which effectively kills the environmental concern – is a no-brainer. It’s the easiest possible win for this industry, and a crucial step on the path to rehabilitation.  Beyond that, the challenge is cultural.  “NGMI,” short for “not gonna make it,” is the most popular slogan in crypto right now. Much like “have fun staying poor,” it’s deployed to mock anti-crypto sentiment. Bought bitcoin just before a crash? NGMI. More worried about the climate crisis than about gambling with JPEG files? NGMI.  This is, in a word, annoying. NFTs are a genuinely exciting technological innovation, in many ways – a new framework for buying and selling digital goods, with potentially game-changing implications for the so-called “creator economy.” It’s a shame that they’re still so easily dismissed, but rhetorical tactics like these aren’t helping make the case.  Why not go with a gentler approach? NFT acolytes would do well to assuage the fears of the crypto-curious, rather than shutting them down.  While proof-of-stake may be something of a silver bullet for the climate question (at least for Ethereum – ETH miners will continue to orbit other cryptocurrencies, even after the switch), the cultural one is more complicated. There’s no single answer here. But if NFTs are going to find their way to the general public, the industry should at least acknowledge the problem.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | SPONSORED,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/04/who-really-wants-corporate-nfts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/84ce634c3a1a07f45e5891b8bac8570b162a0b5a-4765x3177.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

At the time of writing, BTC trades north of $48,000, a critical support zone that could support a fresh jump into previous highs. Although in lower timeframes there has been some &apos;crab like&apos; action, higher timeframes still record important gains. Trader Justin Bennet believes the key of the next leg up will be unlock as Bitcoin moves back into the $50,000 to $53,000 area. If the bulls can break above those levels, BTC&apos;s price should re-entered the $60,000 zone for the first time since May 2021. Otherwise, Bitcoin could still see some downside risk towards the middle area of its current levels at $45,000. Failure to sustain that support could see BTC return to the $40,700 area with danger of slipping further into the $36,500, as seen below. Unlike September, October has been historically a green month for BTC. Many traders are betting on this possibility.

42411893,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgwJN,1633367471,How to Get a Job in Crypto,"As demand to trade digital assets continues to rise, so do cryptocurrency job openings. If you want to turn your passion for cryptocurrency from a hobby into an occupation, there is no better time to make that leap than now. A report that pulled data from Indeed showed a 118% increase in cryptocurrency-related job postings since September 2020.  Read more: What Is Cryptocurrency?  Despite the industry demand for new hires, entering the crypto market isn’t easy. You’ll need to have a good idea of the type of job you want to land and the skillset to match. Here are some tips to get started.  Getting started: choosing a crypto sector  The first step of getting a job in the crypto industry is to identify your niche. With every job title comes a different set of qualifications, roles and requirements. Here are some of the most popular sectors under the umbrella of cryptocurrency jobs and some of the skills that typically accompany roles that are relevant to those areas.  Blockchain development  Blockchain developers are the most in-demand people right now in the crypto industry. According to the 2021 Global Blockchain Employment Report, global demand for blockchain developers is expected to increase 300%-500% yearly. Blockchain developers are also one of the highest-paying roles among cryptocurrency jobs with an annual average salary of $123,750. To be competitive for this role, you’ll need hard programming skills. The main programming languages used include C++, C#, ,Solidity GO, JavaScript and Python, although it’s always worth checking with a recruiter which languages are preferable for your chosen company.  Entry-level job opportunities:  Junior full stack developer  Graduate software developer  Blockchain legal assistant  Junior developer  Journalism  When it comes to cryptocurrency journalism, there are two main qualities that editorial organizations will look for in talent: strong writing ability and strong crypto knowledge. Although many journalists can lean on one or the other, having both will give you the best chance of landing a job in the competitive market. There are a number of crypto-focused university courses and certifications available to provide you with a solid understanding of the industry, along with a range of free online training options.  If you’re an aspiring cryptocurrency journalist but lack the experience of a competitive candidate, consider submitting freelance articles to publications to build up a portfolio of work. Most organizations will gladly accept freelance work paid for on a per-article basis. That serves as a good way to build connections in the industry. A quick search for “crypto journalist” on LinkedIn’s job board yields more than 3,000 results.  Entry-level job opportunities:  Content writer  Research analyst  Social media manager  Assistant editor  Venture capital  For every hot crypto startup trying to change the world, there’s a venture capital firm behind the scenes funding its operations. Working in cryptocurrency venture capital is a lot like its traditional finance counterpart. To work in this field, you’ll need a solid understanding of economics, financial modeling and entrepreneurial savvy. Roles in the sector are some of the more competitive and highest paid jobs in the crypto industry.  Entry-level job opportunities:  Investment analyst  Research associate  Venture capital intern  Junior portfolio analyst  Mining  If you’re interested in a more hands-on, tech-focused career in cryptocurrency, look no further than working for a crypto mining company. There are plenty of jobs centered around maintaining the data centers and mining plants that require a variety of skills, such as an understanding of electrical systems and engineering ability. Think of jobs you would find at a power plant, but for mining cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Mining companies also frequently require content writers, marketing staff and other administrative roles, making them a great entry point for aspiring crypto professionals.  Read more: Can You Still Mine Bitcoin and Other Crypto From Home?  Entry-level job opportunities:  Datacenter technician  Electrician  Mining process engineer  Content creator  Junior marketing assistant  Network, network, network  When it comes to getting a cryptocurrency job, who you know can be as important as the skills you possess. This industry is all about networking, and so whether you’re a journalist looking to find a scoop or a startup founder looking for investors, making connections is key to advancing your career. While the crypto community is heavily online, don’t underestimate the value of attending in-person meetups and conventions. Conventions and conferences are a great place to get your feet wet and meet people who work in the industry. And don’t overlook the value of smaller meetups hosted by specific companies or projects, usually in large metropolitan areas. Because crypto is still a relatively new industry, it’s much easier to connect directly with senior executives than it is in traditional finance.  Resources for finding crypto events:  Eventbrite  Blocksocial  Immerse yourself in the industry  Another important step for anyone looking to join the industry is to immerse yourself in it. This can include things such as:  Learning to trade digital assets.  Signing up and using different crypto-based platforms.  Opening crypto wallets.  Reading the news closely every day.  Following and (carefully) interacting with crypto Twitter.  Familiarizing yourself with crypto-native terminology.  If you do those things, you’ll stand a much better chance of impressing any crypto employer and showing you’re serious (and passionate) about entering the industry.

13222544,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=473004,1633366814,Why The Bitcoin At $100K Discourse Remains Strong Despite Market Crashes,"Bitcoin no doubt had an eventful ride through the month of September. The month which usually carries promises of price dips and crashes, and overall low market momentum maintained its reputation. This led to a value loss of over 20% in the market, causing cryptocurrencies to tumble down in the market. For the majority of the market, it was a matter of holding on long enough for the month to run out. Now that September is behind us, it is time to look forward. October has historically been known to perform in the complete opposite of its predecessor. This is when assets recover their lost value, and often the start of another rally that carries through to December. So while price predictions may have looked like wishful thinking through the bloody month of September, the new month may offer better trends that will see the price hit $100K before the year runs out. Factors Moving Bitcoin Price Green put forward the factors which he believed would drive bitcoin&apos;s price to its new highs. Laying out five factors, the CEO explained in clear and concise terms why the price of bitcoin was set to surge. The first, Green said, was the Federal Reserves&apos; reluctance to ban cryptocurrencies. Speculations in the crypto space had been that the U.S. would follow the footsteps of China and banned cryptocurrencies. But the Federal Reserve had stated that it had no intention of doing so.

In addition to the $1.3 million in cryptocurrencies, authorities seized $375,000 in cash and two luxury vehicles from the alleged perpetrators.

42424530,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2prXh,1633361283,Stablecoin Issuers Could Soon Face Bank-Like Regulations,"Stablecoin issuers including Tether and Circle could soon be subject to bank-like regulations, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal.  The reported recommendation is part of a Treasury-led presidential advisory group’s upcoming stablecoin report. First announced in July, the report is now expected to be released in late October.  A Treasury spokesperson declined to comment.  A senior administration official confirmed to CoinDesk that the report is accurate and that the federal government is looking at two different pathways. The first is the congressional pathway outlined by the WSJ, though the official did not provide specifics. The second is through the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), a panel of regulators tasked with monitoring potential risks to the financial system.  The news comes as Capitol Hill grows increasingly concerned about the lack of regulation in the $130 billion stablecoin market.  In a floor speech on Wednesday, pro-crypto Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) called for regular audits of stablecoin issuers and expressed concern with the lack of transparency of major issuers’ reserve backings. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler has suggested that stablecoins might be classified as securities under U.S. law, thus subjecting them to more regulatory scrutiny.  A number of stablecoin issuers are in the process of, or have stated intentions to, obtain bank-like regulatory status. Circle said in August it wants to be a national crypto bank; Paxos, which issues USDP (formerly PAX) and BUSD in partnership with Binance, got a conditional banking charter in April.  “Today’s news reports about the potential recommendations from the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets (PWG) is encouraging, as the time has come to address the risks and seize the significant opportunities of dollar digital currencies like USD Coin (USDC),” Circle Chief Strategy Officer Dante Disparte told CoinDesk through a spokesperson,” adding:  “Circle has already been working toward becoming a full-reserve national commercial bank, and we strongly believe that a full-reserve banking model built on digital currency technology can lead to a more efficient, fair, inclusive and resilient financial system.”  In a research note Friday, investment firm Wedbush Securities said the news casts a favorable light on the Facebook-initiated Diem project.  ”We believe Silvergate/Diem should receive the green light from regulators shortly after the regulatory goalposts are established given Silvergate’s longstanding warm relationship with regulators and very conservative nature in which it plans to manage stablecoin reserve balances,” Wedbush analyst David Chiaverini wrote.

Read more: The Top Universities for Blockchain – Methodology  This year’s ranking rates 230 schools internationally, expanding the sample from just U.S. schools in our first university ranking last year.  Overall, the National University of Singapore is in first place as a result of its multiple blockchain research centers, its frequently hosted blockchain-themed conferences, its many blockchain clubs, its company partnerships and its masters program in digital financial technology.  Also representing Asia in the top 10 are Hong Kong Polytechnic, Tsinghua University and Chinese University of Hong Kong. RMIT in Melbourne comes second while representing Europe are the University of Zurich, UCL and ETH Zurich.  The top U.S schools are Berkeley (third) and MIT (fifth). Cornell, which was second last year, is now in 17th place. Stanford, which placed fourth in 2020, is now in 12th. Harvard, which was fifth last year, is now 49th, reflecting stronger competition this time, and that schools with strong overall reputations aren’t always the best performers when it comes to blockchain.

Link Global set up a site in Sturgeon County using dormant natural gas without notifying the AUC, according to a CBC report Friday.  A second site at Kirkwall didn’t meet AUC rules on proving the plant had no adverse effects on locals or the environment.  The plant at Sturgeon County has relocated while Link Global has filed paperwork for the Kirkwall plant to resume operations, CBC reported. The two plants operated without approval for 364 days and 426 days, respectively.  The AUC published its findings against Link Global on Aug. 19, concluding that “Link Global failed to meet and continues not to meet the applicable conditions for an exemption from the requirement to obtain permission to operate a power plant.”  The commission’s enforcement team proposed that Link Global pays nearly $2 million for alleged economic gains from generating electricity and more than $5 million for gains from mining bitcoin.  Such a fine would be only the second time it has handed out a disgorgement penalty, the AUC has said.  In response to the proposal, Link Global CEO Stephen Jenkins issued a statement, saying the company had “made some mistakes” but that the proposals by the AUC are disproportionate.  “What enforcement staff is proposing is punitive and not consistent with the AUC’s August 19, 2021 decision and earlier operating requirements during the process,” he added.

Investment firm B. Riley Securities estimated that Greenidge will report $40.7 million in revenue for the quarter, according to FactSet. Shares of Greenridge were declining 1.4% to 24.75 on Monday morning.  Greenidge expects to post a net loss in a range of $16 million to $19 million and adjusted EBITDA in a range of $18 million to $22 million, according to a statement. The expected net loss is driven by about $30 million of charges associated with the merger with Support.com.  Greenidge mined 729 bitcoin during the third quarter and had approximately 15,300 miners in operation with 1.2 EH/s of combined capacity as of Sept. 30. The company ended the quarter with $52 million of cash and fair market value of cryptocurrency holdings.  As of Oct. 1, Greenidge had 67 stockholders of record, an increase from 11 as of Sept. 13, Greenidge said in a filing. In a September filing, the company said it had the 11 holders of common stock and 66 preferred stockholders. A stock split in March made each share of series A preferred stock convertible into four shares of class B common stock.

I don’t want to go on with this because it’s just about ticking boxes. My dad happened to agree.  “We went to the school, I think it was on my 16th birthday, and I withdrew.”  Read more: The Top Universities for Blockchain by CoinDesk 2021  You may not know Keonne Rodriguez by name, but you know his story. From the age of nine he compulsively played with the family computer, and was being paid to code web pages for local businesses by the time he was 14. He would go on to major success in the blockchain industry – but despite his obvious talent and focus, he had challenges with formal education.  “I was in advanced programs, honors, advanced placement [but] I was really starting to develop an allergy to bureaucracy and things that didn’t make sense.” The breaking point came when his high school instituted a required computing course – one Rodriguez is certain he could have taught.  The college conundrum  Some of the most successful people in the tech industry either didn’t attend or didn’t complete college. Famed dropouts include Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak – world-changers who made billions of dollars without a diploma.  Those stories have become totemic in the tech world, even as broader skepticism of college spreads. That skepticism is partly driven by financial calculus: As tuition and student debt loads rise dramatically, there’s more reason to ask whether the investment in college is really worth it. Various startups and reformers have established alternative paths, from coding boot camps to online certification programs to radical new models like Minerva University.  Some organizations, such as Peter Thiel’s Thiel Fellowship, push an even stronger line: not that college is too expensive or inefficient but that, at least for some people, it’s a waste of time at any cost. The Fellowship awards $100,000 to “young people who want to build new things instead of sitting in a classroom.” Recipients must skip or drop out of college to be eligible.  That backdrop makes things particularly challenging and confusing for young people interested in careers in crypto. Spending three or four or five years on a campus could seem like a big sacrifice in an industry that changes so fast. And perhaps the single most widely admired person in crypto stands as an example of the potential of skipping school: Vitalik Buterin received the Thiel Fellowship in 2014 and, instead of going to college, used the time to build Ethereum.  But the data about college outcomes tells a much different story than the biographies of these few outliers. The average college degree holder will earn $625,483 more than a high school graduate over his or her lifetime. College graduates also have much higher lifetime employment rates, better lifelong health and even longer-lasting marriages, according to a 2015 study by University of Maine education researcher Philip Trostel.  Moderate critics of higher ed acknowledge this reality. “I’m a pragmatist. At the individual level, you should take the system as it’s constructed,” said investor Marc Andreessen during a 2020 interview that was otherwise quite critical of the status quo in higher ed. “I think it’s actually quite dangerous to give someone as an individual the advice, ‘don’t go to college.’”  The data about college outcomes tells a much different story than the biographies of these few outliers  The reality on the ground in the crypto and blockchain industries, too, seems a bit less freewheeling than the mythos would have it. While reporting this story, I reached out to about a dozen close contacts in the industry, asking if they knew anyone who had found a role building in crypto without going to college. Rodriguez was the only example I was able to unearth. Unscientifically, it seems the overwhelming majority of people with serious careers in crypto are college graduates.  That makes sense once you remember how many complex ideas are wrapped up in the design and deployment of blockchains. The crypto industry moves fast, but that’s in part because it draws from a many-layered, complex “stack” of intellectual traditions, legal norms and technical breakthroughs stretching back decades, even centuries. That includes not just extremely advanced computer science, but the far frontiers of securities law, economics, even sociology and art.  The bitcoin off-ramp  Keonne Rodriguez defied those odds and immediately thrived – not just without going to college, but without even finishing high school. Despite his outlier status, his means of ascent holds career lessons even for people who do take the college route.  Most importantly, Rodriguez was able to clearly demonstrate his real-world effectiveness thanks to a portfolio of web design work built up in his early teens. His portfolio was the first step towards a string of full-time positions that grew his skill set further, at the same age he would have normally been attending college. Eventually he found himself a very well-paid coder and designer at Cleversafe, a security company that’s now part of IBM.  But then things hit a rough patch, thanks to the same thing that was derailing a lot of tech careers circa 2012: Bitcoin.  “I got so obsessed with bitcoin that I couldn’t stop tweeting about it,” Rodriguez told me. “So [Cleversafe] got concerned. We mutually decided it was better for me to focus on my passion.”  Things moved fast after that. Rodriguez, who was based in the U.K., showed up at an early bitcoin conference organized in London by Blockchain.com.  Blockchain “had just gotten some money from Roger Ver and they were building out the initial staff. I just told [them], I’m interested, here’s my portfolio and if you guys need someone let’s talk. I was interviewed by Dan Held and Changpeng Zhao.”  Those names may sound familiar. Nearly a decade later, Held is head of growth at the crypto exchange Kraken. Changpeng Zhao is slightly better known as “CZ,” the CEO of Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by a country mile. Rodriguez became employee number eight at Blockchain, living and working with a small initial crew in York, U.K. He eventually became head of user experience for Blockchain’s wallet, then its main product.  But can you write poetry?  Rodriguez, who evolved from web coding to front-end design, could clearly demonstrate results. But in fields where results are less tangible, that approach doesn’t work as well. “Anyone with hopes of a managerial position needs a college diploma,” for example, according to Steve Mintz, a historian and education researcher at the University of Texas.  That also applies to much of the high-level, back-end system design work involved in blockchain projects. In fact, blockchain encompasses so many deep concepts that it’s an ideal introduction to computer science as a whole.  “I use blockchain as a way to introduce a number of computer science fields in my courses,” says Professor Ron Van Der Meyden at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. “Here we’ve got this brilliant application which, to really understand how it’s working, there’s a lot of pieces of computer science we can introduce – cryptography, consensus. And each of those has a whole lot of [complexity] behind them.”  That sort of deep theoretical knowledge may seem abstract from the outside, but according to Van Der Meyden, it’s extremely practical.  “You can look at a particular thing you need to code, and identify within that problem, [for example,] here’s something that a finite set automata would be good for,” he says. “You learn how to think about, ‘I’m not just going to write a program, I’m going to really care about how efficiently that program performs.’ That requires a conceptual toolset.”  That’s why Van Der Meyden believes there’s little comparison between the strictly functional coding knowledge conveyed in condensed courses, and what students get from a full computer science degree.  “With respect to code camps, I would say that what those are giving you is just the coding skills. It’s kind of like, you can speak English but can you write poetry?”  Van Der Meyden also believes those pushing against college may have a point – but only within their own very narrow sphere. Peter Thiel “is thinking of his experiences in Silicon Valley, Harvard, Yale, that small fragment of the world,” he says of the entrepreneur’s Fellowship program. By contrast, many of Van Der Meyden’s students come from developing parts of Asia. UNSW considers educating these students something of a social mission because it ultimately helps their home nations advance and grow.  “That’s a very different world than the world Thiel is thinking about.”  College in context  As Marc Andreessen pointed out, it’s important to separate the broader debate over college from individual decisions. Simple math shows that going to college is still the right choice for those who have the option. And this is crypto – we trust math, right?  Still, it’s important to be tuned in to the broader debate, which breaks down into essentially two camps. On one side are those who focus on declining public spending on higher education, which has pushed costs on to students. On the other side are those who argue the university model itself is broken, and that new educational approaches and less reliance on credentials are the longer-term solution.  It’s important to keep in mind that critics of traditional colleges are often trying to profit from the alternatives. Andreessen Horowitz has substantial investments in edtech startups trying to disrupt college with new models for financing and delivering education. So does Peter Thiel – making the Thiel Fellowship as much a marketing expense as a philanthropic project.  Broadly, would-be education disruptors “unbundle” the college experience – with its partying, athletics and residence halls – from pure education. For example, it was for a time thought that Massive Open Online Courses, or MOOC, would upend the traditional college model by providing free or very cheap lectures from top-tier professors, available anywhere in the world.  But the promise of edtech has become much hazier. The coronavirus pandemic shutdown of most in-person schooling was a chance for online learning to shine, but it largely wound up demonstrating the limitations of education ripped from its social context and individual feedback. Endless Zoom lectures and isolation have led to mass burnout for students and educators alike. That shouldn’t have been a surprise – remote alternatives had already proven ineffective for most learners. Fewer than 15% of participants, for instance, complete MOOCs.  “I think it’s much more than creating great content and putting it up on the web,” David Deming, professor of education and economics at Harvard, said on the a16z podcast last year. “I think that’s why MOOCs haven’t revolutionized the market, because that’s not what education is. Education is not just content, it’s also engagement and personalization.”  It’s also worth remembering that even as some members of the American elite voice skepticism of traditional college, others are willing to go to absurd lengths to get their kids on exactly that path. The 2019 college admissions scandal arguably showed just how valuable college is to the wealthiest Americans, who were willing to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars and commit obvious fraud to fake admissions credentials for their unimpressive spawn.  But that’s just the egregious tip of the double-standard iceberg: One recent study found that 43 % of white Harvard students were either legacy admissions (students attending the same college their parents or other relatives attended), athletes or related to donors. (The rate was under 16% for non-white students). If those kids aren’t going to code camp or getting an education on YouTube, maybe you shouldn’t be either.  On the other hand, it’s true that college isn’t for everyone, and it’s certainly not perfect. I know that firsthand: My initial career goal was to become a professor, and I even earned a PhD and landed a short string of research jobs.  Ultimately, I found myself leaving academia. I had a variety of reasons, but a big one was that I saw the life of the mind dying a slow death in American higher education. During my career I taught at universities and colleges of various stripes, and found that many of them were havens for mediocrity and stasis, with professors merely pantomiming research – and even more often, pantomiming teaching.  There are still many colleges full of brilliant, engaged people in wonderful, grass-green settings, and I have walked that sort of glorious lawn. But not every college is the intellectual Arcadia of myth – in fact, it sometimes seems that fewer and fewer of them are. And this, too, is borne out by the numbers: For non-technical fields like business and social science, the rank and quality of a school has a major impact on the career prospects of its graduates.  The quitter’s dilemma  On both sides of the college debate I heard consensus on at least one good reason not to go to college: if you really, really don’t want to.  “For someone who is convinced that they’re a genius and don’t need a college education,” says Trostel, the education researcher, “they’re not going to put in the effort and they’re not going to get much out of it.”  In other words, it’s not that being brilliant guarantees you’ll succeed without a degree – it’s that without some humility, you’ll never earn one. Unlike most investments, education doesn’t just require time and money, but also mental and emotional focus. If you can’t or won’t apply those, you might as well not waste resources trying to earn a degree.  Going straight into the workforce might seem like an immediate way to learn practical skills – but it’s hard to say in advance what ‘practical’ really means  This was certainly true for Keonne Rodriguez. As much as his clear passion and portfolio justified skipping college, he was also very self-aware about the challenges he would face with a traditionally structured education. He even tried to attend college, twice, after completing his GED. His second try was at a computer science program at Oxford.  “I figured, it’s such a prestigious program, it must be different,” he says. “But I figured out it’s not the program, it’s me.” He dropped out, and soon after that he joined Blockchain.  Cases like Rodriguez’s, it must be emphasized, are exceedingly rare – particularly because Rodriguez, whose father was a lifeguard, didn’t come into the world with either a thick family bankroll or a built-in professional network. Many of the world’s celebrated dropouts rely on those advantages: Bill Gates’ father, for instance, was a prominent lawyer, and his mother was a major business figure who helped Microsoft ink a crucial early deal with IBM.  And as much as we celebrate successful dropouts, it’s just as important to remember those who fail. We don’t know most of their names, but you might include Mark Zuckerberg: Facebook has made him fabulously wealthy, but blindness to complex social impacts may earn his creation the same infamy now accorded tobacco and oil companies. Or take Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, who modeled herself after Steve Jobs, in part by dropping out of Stanford. She is now facing criminal fraud charges in large part because of her lack of education in the basic medical science at the core of her failed company. At age 37, her name is tarnished forever.  “There’s also an ethics component” to education, says Matthew D’Amore, a professor and associate dean at Cornell Tech, which offers courses on blockchain and the law. “How does my idea fit into the world? Is my idea just designed to make money or is it designed to improve people’s lives? Those kinds of things don’t necessarily come naturally to folks, and the opportunity to get that perspective exists on a college campus differently than elsewhere.”  It’s a final helpful way to think about the college question for aspiring blockchain innovators. Going straight into the workforce might seem like an immediate way to learn practical skills – but it’s hard to say in advance what “practical” really means. The complexity of crypto isn’t just in the technical dimension: It touches on nearly every aspect of human life, and its transformative potential is so profound it demands truly deep, expansive thinking. And the industry rewards that: it’s certainly why I’m here.  Famous dropout Steve Jobs, surprisingly, is also evidence for the value of a broad education. Though he left the formal college track, he frequently sat in on college courses. The most important one wasn’t about computers at all: The seeds of Apple’s nuanced design philosophy, the differentiator that helped it become the world’s most valuable company, were planted by a course on calligraphy taught by a former monk.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,David Z.

Despite this exceptional increase in TVL (from under a billion at the start of 2020), the number of users that interact with DeFi still pales in comparison with how many people invest in the rest of the crypto market, and these numbers are a drop in the bucket compared to those posted by traditional finance. DeFi&apos;s TVL is only a fraction of the two trillion dollar valuation of the entire crypto market. Furthermore, the entire crypto market is valued at a figure smaller than just one publicly traded company on the stock market, Apple. Putting these figures side by side, one could assert that the growth potential for DeFi is astounding.

However, it all started with the idea of creating a digital currency that no financial institution could control. What is Bitcoin? Bitcoin is the most popular digital currency or cryptocurrency founded by someone named Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Nakamoto designed Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system in a decentralized environment. The potential of this system was only realized later when traditional banking systems became rigged to benefit the investors rather than the users. Bitcoin is created through a process of Bitcoin mining which requires specialized mining hardware and software. Mining is a process of solving complex computations and registering transactions to create new blocks on the blockchain. Blockchain is a public digital ledger where every cryptocurrency transaction is recorded. The present While the new era of digital currencies a decade ago was considered to be a futile investment, the risk-takers back then are rewarded today. Starting from the low price of a few cents, Bitcoin today is priced at $42.223 and reached the highest of around $70,000 earlier this year.

42424537,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2prfh,1633350938,"Airdrop, Staking Announcement Power Axie Infinity’s AXS Token to Record High","Axie Infinity’s AXS token has climbed 41% in the last 24 hours to a record $153. The surge comes days after the play-to-earn game announced that it would distribute over $60 million worth of tokens to its early adopters and the launch of staking capabilities.  Since the Sept. 30 announcement, the price has more than doubled from $73, according to data from TradingView.  According to the AXS staking dashboard, since the announcement more than 12 million AXS have been staked. Staking is the process of participating in transaction validation on a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain, similar to mining. In a PoS blockchain, anyone with the minimum required balance of the relevant cryptocurrency is able to validate transactions and earn staking rewards.  “Staking yields on AXS remained exceptionally lucrative (189% APR), even with 12.4 million AXS staked already and growing, leading to a real risk of a supply crunch for AXS,” said Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Synergia Capital. “This could result in exponential, albeit likely unsustainable, upside, and in the end leading to erratic and choppy price action.”  The advance is also likely sapping away demand from other gaming and NFT-related assets as investors jump on momentum trades, according to Vinokourov.  Axie Infinity’s growth this year has surged, pushing its market cap to $9.3 billion. In countries where the earnings from playing Axie work out better than the average income, traffic is high. The Philippines ranks first, Brazil second and Venezuela third for traffic, according to data from Similarweb.  “The rise in price can be attributed to Axie’s growing popularity and how easy it is to get into,” said John Pangilinan, partner at Signum Capital. “I also feel that Axie has done some pretty smart marketing, such as their scholarship program.”  The Axie community offers scholarships to aspiring players so that they can get started without having to pay the high cost for a “starter team,” currently around $1,065. These scholarships are not official in-game features, they are done by a trusted community member who gives out a free Axie team and often takes a cut of the player’s earnings.  “I don’t think there’s another competitor that has this kind of price movement right now, therefore the attraction is high for both players and retail investors,” Pangilinan said.  The blockchain gaming startup also recently announced on the Scoop podcast that it will be launching a new decentralized exchange. According to The Block, it will be built on “Ronin,” an Ethereum-linked sidechain purpose-built for Axie Infinity.  “This will remove some of the friction that exists for players who have to move their tokens to platforms,” said Vinokourov. “The move will improve user experience and further solidify AXS’ market leading status in the world of blockchain gaming,” he added.",POSITIVE,AXS,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TRADING | AIRDROP,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/04/airdrop-staking-announcement-power-axie-infinitys-axs-token-to-record-high,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a0543a2aa1a7793827e4f1e7f9a044b128f2fe6a-1339x821.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376082,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwEDOH,1633347005,Bitcoin Steady at $48K as OMG Token Hits 3-Year High,"While bitcoin and the broader crypto market look to be taking a breather, OMG, the native token of scaling product OMG Network, has reached its highest level since April 2018.  Bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency by market value, was trading sideways on Monday – at about $48,000 for the third straight day – after rising by nearly 10% on Friday. That was the biggest single-day gain in almost three months, based on CoinDesk 20 data.  The cryptocurrency rose 11.7% last week, defying what appears to be a turn away from risky assets in traditional markets, as the Federal Reserve ruled out plans to follow China’s lead and outlaw virtual currency businesses. Further, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler reiterated support for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) rooted in regulated futures markets.  Although increased hopes for a futures-based ETF are likely to keep the market buoyant in the short term, an eventual disappointment, if any, could bring some selling pressure.  “Run-it-up turbo and disappoint? This makes me think of July 2018, when crypto went on a manic run higher driven by misplaced ETF expectations,” trader and analyst Alex Kruger tweeted Sunday, adding that an ETF approval would be massively bullish and lead to rotation of money into bitcoin from alternative cryptocurrencies.  The SEC has already extended its review of applications from Global X, Kryptoin, Valkyrie and WisdomTree by 45 to 60 days. The new deadline dates for the SEC to make decisions are Nov. 21 for Global X, Dec. 8 for Valkyrie, Dec. 11 for WisdomTree and Dec. 24 for Kryptoin, as CoinDesk’s Jamie Crawley reported. Decisions on several other ETF applications may be made in the coming weeks.  According to technical charts, last week’s move in bitcoin has opened doors for a retest of early September highs above $52,000.  “Bitcoin finally resolved its 10-day sideways range by exceeding the downtrend, which had been in place since early September,” research firm FSinsights said in an email. “Note, trends had turned negative a month ago technically, but after a visible three-wave decline into late September, Friday’s move is a big positive in helping to resolve this consolidation. The first upside target lies at September highs at $52,956, then $64,895.”  OMG rally continues  OMG Network’s OMG token is trading at a three-and-a-half-year high of $18 on Coinbase. The cryptocurrency has seen a sixfold rally since July 19 and surged 82% last week alone, topping the list of best-performing coins with more than a $1 billion market cap last week, according to Messari data.  Analysts said the token is benefitting from surging investor interest in so-called layer 2, or “L2,″ scaling projects that facilitate faster and cheaper transactions and help reduce the load on Ethereum’s blockchain. OMG Network creates a value transfer layer on top of Ethereum that bundles Ethereum transactions and validates them through a speed-optimized child chain before sending them back to the Ethereum blockchain for confirmation.  “OMG’s rise seems to be on investor excitement in L2s and on the announcement of the mainnet launch of Boba Network, an L2 Optimistic rollup, as OMG token holders are eligible for an upcoming airdrop of the BOBA governance token,” digital currency platform CrossTower research analyst Martin Gaspar told CoinDesk.  Boba Network, a new layer 2 product created by blockchain developer Enya in collaboration with OMG Network, will be airdropping its governance token BOBA to OMG token holders as of the snapshot date of Nov. 12 on a 1:1 basis.  “Named the Boba Network, the project is a layer-2 solution that allows crypto to have payment processing speeds that rival payment heavyweights like Visa and Mastercard,” Don Guo, CEO of Broctagon, said. “Game-changers like these, much like the NEXUS WorldBook movement, which is an inter-exchange liquidity network for digital assets, can create greater visibility and trust for crypto as a whole.”  OMG’s rally is accompanied by an exodus of coins from exchanges and appears sustainable. The number of coins held on exchanges fell to 28.9 million Sunday, hitting the lowest since September 2018, according to Glassnode. The tally has declined by 42% since February.  A slide in exchange balance typically represents strong holding sentiment is taken as a bullish indicator.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/04/bitcoin-steady-around-48k-as-omg-token-hits-3-year-high,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e0294f832bfe1e11452c07a0359ee25078358f0b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376075,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwEDFT,1633339703,CBDC Impact on Banking Sector Could Be Manageable: New BIS Report,"A Bank for International Settlements (BIS) working group of seven central banks has determined the impacts of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) on crowding out banks as middlemen in transactions and as facilitators of lending could be manageable for the industry if given the time and flexibility to adjust.  The working group published not one but three new reports on Thursday exploring customer needs, technological design alternatives and financial stability implications of a general purpose or “retail” CBDC – meaning a digital currency issued directly by a central bank – that would coexist with private payment systems.  CBDCs are seen as a means of making financial services faster, accessible and cost efficient, according to leading global institutions like the BIS and the International Monetary Fund. As it is a digital representation of a jurisdiction’s official currency, it has certain perks: A retail CBDC can be issued directly to wallets on smartphones particularly to those without access to private banking services, and cut the costs of printing and managing cash. More than 80 countries around the world are currently considering or testing a potential CBDC.  The reports come on the heels of a study published by the BIS that demonstrated how CBDCs could reduce costs and speed up cross-border transactions. The European Central Bank (ECB) is gearing up for a 24-month investigation into a digital euro, and the U.S. Federal Reserve has plans to release its own report on CBDCs. Meanwhile, China is powering ahead with trialing a digital yuan.  The reports are a follow up to the 2020 BIS publication on the foundational principles and feasibility of a CBDC. All reports were compiled by a working group of seven central banks (The Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the ECB, the Fed, Sweden’s Sveriges Riksbank, the Swiss National Bank) and the BIS.  “This group is helping central banks to answer difficult and practical questions about how to offer safe and neutral currency with interoperable systems that harness new technology and serve the public,” said Benoît Cœuré, head of the BIS Innovation Hub and co-chair of the working group that produced the reports, in a statement to the press.  Although the reports do not make specific design or technological recommendations, they outlined general expectations for how CBDCs should work that align with BIS objectives. Of the three reports, the one on financial stability implications is the most detailed, laying out potential risks to the banking sector that might arise from the introduction of a CBDC and how central banks could mitigate those risks.  Financial stability  The BIS report on the effects of a CBDC on financial stability outlined a number of risks bounded by three main uncertainties: the future structure of the financial system, the design of a CBDC and the scale of user adoption.  According to the report, risks to financial stability depend on the take-up, or rate of adoption, of a CBDC as well as bank funding, lending and resilience. If take-up is too fast, it could throw the existing financial and banking systems out of balance, the report says. The prevailing fear is that the use of any CBDC would require a shift of funds out of bank deposits and into digital cash. Without bank deposits, banks won’t have the funds to issue loans that help them make money. Should CBDCs rapidly replace bank deposits, they could reduce banks’ ability to lend, leading to instability in the financial system.  But if it happens slowly, with enough time for banks to adjust, the report says the effects of such a shift would be manageable. The report lays out a number of design options that could help control CBDC take-up and the crowding out of banks including setting holding and transactional limits on CBDCs, and considering different ways of remuneration. Take-up of a CBDC will depend on a number of factors including how attractive it proves to be in comparison to cash. For example, a CBDC can be non-interest bearing like cash, in which case it would seem less attractive. The report notes that demand for non-interest-bearing electronic money in the U.K. and European Union has been relatively low.  “However, CBDCs would be as safe as cash, with added electronic benefits and possibly attracting greater demand,” the report said.  If central banks issue a remunerated interest-earning CBDC it would prove to be a more attractive substitute for cash, low interest-bearing deposits or other cash-substitutes, risking rapid emptying of deposits, the report added.  “It could be attractive to households that are particularly risk averse or have already spread deposits across multiple bank accounts to minimize balances above deposit protection limits. Businesses might also wish to transfer some of their uninsured balances to a CBDC,” the report said.  Moderating take-up through remuneration and functionality will slow sizable shifts to any CBDC, according to the report.  But it also warns these considerations are not a statement of policy, only a framework for future work.  Unmet user needs  Although controlling the speed of CBDC rollout is a key consideration for financial stability, that does not mean CBDCs should not be adopted and used at scale.  The accompanying report on user needs and adoption says driving CBDC adoption is key to fulfilling central bank public policy goals that motivate its issuance.  “The CBDC system would require some capital investment, including the costs of the central bank to set up the core system as well as some costs borne by the private sector to interoperate and provide services on top of the core system,” the report said.  The report also says that any retail CBDC should meet “unmet user needs” without requiring “all users to buy new devices.”  According to the report, unmet user needs include the perks of holding money directly issued to them by the central bank like the certainty that a transaction is complete without risk of reversal (settlement finality), the ease with which assets are converted to cash (liquidity) and the trust users can place in their central bank (integrity).  “In addition, it would be important for CBDC to meet consumer or merchant demand that might not currently be met by existing payments products and services,” the report said, adding that meeting these needs involves encouraging private innovation in CBDC ecosystems.  The report also says consumer needs and the strategies for driving CBDC adoption would vary depending on the jurisdictions and reflect different economic needs, structures, and payment landscapes.  CBDC design options  The take-up of a CBDC also depends on its design, according to the working group’s reports.  But regardless of the design, developing and running a CBDC system would be a major undertaking for a central bank, the report on system design and interoperability said.  The report says that CBDCs will work effectively through a public-private partnership where financial institutions in both sectors cooperate to integrate CBDCs with existing payments systems.  “The central banks contributing to this report anticipate any CBDC ecosystem would involve the public and private sectors in a balance, in order to deliver the desired policy outcome and enable innovation that meets users’ evolving payment needs,” the reports said.  Any CBDC ecosystem would need a core ledger (a collection of financial accounts) with supporting infrastructure and rules, but central banks would be the only institutions entitled to issue and redeem a CBDC, the report said. It further explained that the central bank would have the ultimate responsibility for not only designing the CBDC system but also for the operation or oversight of the core ledger.  “Therefore, assigning the roles within a CBDC system would likely be the prerogative of a central bank,” the report said. “Theoretically, a central bank could perform all the functions in an ecosystem, either through directly operating or outsourcing certain functions.”  But central banks aren’t really accustomed to front-end customer service or the offering of day-to-day financial services like commercial banks. So if a CBDC is solely operated by a central bank, the bank has to build a customer interface from the ground up. According to the report, this approach may be useful for countries that don’t already have comprehensive private payment systems in place.  But the central banks that contributed to the report envision CBDC ecosystems based on a broad public-private collaboration, or a “tiered system” where the core roles are assigned to the central bank and other more public-facing roles to private financial institutions like banks, the report said.  “Yet, in any CBDC system, the central bank would face additional operational or oversight tasks and accompanying challenges regardless of the division of responsibilities among the various actors,” the report said.  The report also briefly considers interoperability or the ability of payment systems to exchange information.  While the multiple CBDC prototype tested by the BIS innovation hub focused on the effectiveness of CBDCs in international payments, the reports released on Thursday mainly outlined considerations for domestic interoperability.  According to the report, interoperability would help ensure the coexistence of a CBDC system within a wider payment ecosystem.  “In a domestic context, the characteristics of pre-existing payment systems would likely play a significant role in a CBDC’s interoperability. For example, if common technical interfaces and data or messaging standards already existed, adopting these could reduce costs,” the report said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/04/cbdc-impact-on-banking-sector-could-be-manageable-new-bis-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/104ff183e04981e5da1d6024fcc947c2b86395e7-1500x994.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Polygon’s count of unique daily addresses active either as sender or receiver rose to a record high of 566,516 on Saturday, surpassing Ethereum for the first time, according to data provided by polygonscan. Ethereum’s tally stood at 527,158 on Oct. 2.  The number of active addresses on Polygon has grown by 168% in the past 30 days, while Ethereum’s count has gone up by a meager 0.6%, data from etherscan shows.  Non-fungible tokens (NFT) adoption and gaming have fueled the growth in Polygon’s user base, according to Spencer Noon, an investor in Variant, a cryptocurrency venture capital fund.  “Since July, traders on Polygon OpenSea [the NFT marketplace] have multiplied 45.5x, and NFTs sold by 17.5x,” Spencer said in the Network report published Oct. 2.  “Second, gaming is taking off. Arc8 is one example, achieving 104K DAU [daily active users] days after launch,” Spencer added.  Increased network usage often translates into higher demand for the native token and an increase in its price, Chainalysis’s Philip Gradwell told CoinDesk.  However, the spike in active addresses has yet to give Polygon’s MATIC token a meaningful lift. While the token has risen 12% to $1.27 in the first four days of October, it is still down considerably from September’s high of $1.80.

42376067,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwED5P,1633327130,$22M Drained From Compound Contract That Was Hit for $80M Last Week,"A faulty Compound Finance contract intended to disburse liquidity mining rewards over time was topped off with $66 million in tokens on Sunday morning.  About $22 million of those funds were then exploited due to the same bug that drained $80 million in tokens throughout the latter half of last week, per one DeFi developer, who told CoinDesk that the remaining $44 million has now been determined to be at risk.  Read more: DeFi Money Market Compound Overpays Millions in COMP Rewards in Possible Exploit; Founder Says $80M at Risk  At approximately 9:30 a.m. ET, one ETH address claimed 37,504 of the tokens, worth $12 million, and another claimed 14,995, worth $4.9 million. The funds were claimed by contracts from the MakerDAO DSProxy factory, and are now in two separate addresses.  Additional claims of 9,499, 1,699 and 2,999 COMP have brought the total drained to $22 million.  MakerDAO representatives have been active in helping to find solutions to the bug, per Compound founder Robert Leshner. A MakerDAO rep did not return a request for comment by the time of publication.  In a tweet on Sunday morning, pseudonymous Yearn.Finance core contributor “banteg,” who has also been weighing in on Compound governance forums in the wake of the bug, wrote that the ability to top off the bugged contract has been “known for a few days now” but the community plan “was to keep shush and hope nobody discovers it for a week.”  Compound’s contracts do not have a multi-signature scheme that allows for more immediate upgradability; instead, changes can only be made after a seven-day governance process designed to make the protocol more resilient to hostile changes. That security architecture is now serving as a barrier to a patch to the faulty code.  A debate is underway in the community regarding what users should do with the funds they’ve received. Leshner split the debate broadly into two categories: DeFi “builders” who see protocols like Compound as public goods and the erroneous tokens as belonging to the community, and “profit maximalists” more inclined to say “haha, f*** you, this is your problem.”  The adding of new funds to the contract is still underway. Users are now continuously calling a function to add funds to the Comptroller contract from the Compound Reservoir, potentially putting the added funds at risk.  In a statement to CoinDesk, banteg said that while it was initially estimated the impact of the exploit was just one-quarter of the $66 million recently added funds, more addresses were found that could make claims that would empty the comptroller.  The price of COMP has lost more than 5% in the last 24 hours and in recent trading was at $330.53.
