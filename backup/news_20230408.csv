42411027,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giB3xn,1680984189,"Drugs, Erratic Dismissals and Feuding Founders: Behind Bitcoin Marketplace Paxful’s Unraveling","In September 2016, a police-blotter news item appeared on the website of a local CBS TV affiliate in Miami Beach, Florida: Pedestrians in the upscale area, just a couple of blocks from the former Versace mansion, had spotted two men on the penthouse balcony of a multilevel condominium building, aiming an AR-15-style assault rifle toward the streets below and taking turns holding the weapon while apparently posing for photos.  Three men were arrested and accused of offenses ranging from improper exhibition of a firearm to possession of cocaine and hashish, Miami-Dade County court records show.  The charges were eventually dismissed, and it was the sort of incident that might easily be written off as the puerile hijinks of spring breakers or as one of so many absurd Florida man minor crimes.  What now seems to be more relevant than ever is that the defendants in the case included Ray Youssef and Artur Schaback, the co-founders of Paxful, a website that allowed users to buy and sell bitcoin (BTC) on a peer-to-peer basis, similar to eBay (EBAY) or Craigslist. The company, founded in 2015, had grown to employ more than 200 people in four offices around the world, with $5 billion traded on Paxful by more than 12 million users over the course of its existence, according to court filings.  Paxful closed last week, and Youssef, 46, who served as founder and CEO, attributed the decision to “key staff departures” and “regulatory challenges.” But both Youssef and Schaback, 35, acknowledge that, behind the scenes, their frayed business relationship played a key role in the company’s demise, and the pair are now trading blows in court via a tangle of legal actions and counterclaims.  Former employees allege, in lawsuits and in interviews with CoinDesk, that the company long suffered from severe lapses in management professionalism, including promotions based on favoritism, erratic dismissals, lavish spending on travel and reports of routine cannabis usage on the job by Youssef himself.  Schaback, a co-founder of Paxful with 50% of the company’s Class B common shares who served as chief operating officer, is suing Youssef in Delaware Chancery Court. Schaback says that Youssef cut off his access to company resources and information while he was on paternity leave and that Youssef and other “cohorts” have “looted Paxful coffers.” Key sections of the complaint containing alleged dollar amounts were redacted from the public version.  The lawsuit even goes so far as to accuse Youssef of “an illegal plan to avoid international sanctions on transactions into and out of Russia.”  “Mr. Youssef took unilateral action to permanently shut down Paxful,” Schaback told CoinDesk in an interview. “His plan has been going for the better part of 15 months, but thanks to our civil proceedings in the United States, his plan was discovered and thwarted.”  Youssef, an American citizen now based in Dubai, told CoinDesk in an interview that Schaback was fired for “incompetence and bad behavior” and that Schaback’s suit was a contributing factor in the decision to close.  “It was clear to everyone at the company that Schaback did not have any understanding of what a COO (chief operating officer) was supposed to do,” Youssef’s legal team argued in a March 17 filing in the Delaware case.  In a separate statement sent to CoinDesk after publication of this article, Youssef said: ""I took a pay cut when we began layoffs in 2022 and used my own personal funds to pay engineers to perform vital site functions after Mr. Schaback refused to pay them and put our customer funds in peril.""  Schaback says Paxful is still a viable enterprise and wants the courts to appoint a custodian to assume control of Paxful’s assets. Both Schaback and Youssef confirmed to CoinDesk on Friday that a custodian had been appointed in a hearing late Thursday, though details were scant.  Schaback says his ultimate goal is to realize the company’s original mission of “empowering the forgotten 4 billion unbanked and underbanked.”  “We met because we believed the idea of bitcoin helps the little guy,” Schaback said in an interview.  Humble beginnings  Youssef was born in Egypt and immigrated to the U.S. as a toddler, settling in New York City. He’s a self-taught coder and, for a brief stint, was a professional mixed martial arts fighter. He says he met Schaback, who is Estonian, at a 2014 Bitcoin event.  In a 2018 interview with Digital Trends, Youssef chronicled the humble beginnings of Paxful and how an unbanked sex worker reached out to Schaback and him to get help buying bitcoin so that she could post ads on Backpage – a bitcoin-friendly prostitution and trafficking site that was eventually shut down by the FBI in April 2018.  Schaback and Youssef had co-founded another bitcoin payment service called EasyBitz – it was a dud. Paxful was like EasyBitz “2.0,” and after Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) pulled their integrations from Backpage in 2015, bitcoin was the sole payment method left. Paxful had hit the jackpot with its position in the market.  Youssef said in a filing with the Delaware court that he “was responsible for the development of Paxful’s business operations, marketing, design, support and technical systems administration,” and “wrote some of the code for Paxful’s system,” while “Schaback wrote most of the code for Paxful.”  Paxful’s business model was simple but clever. Users would exchange cash or gift cards – mostly gift cards – for bitcoin. Paxful’s role was to act as a middleman, providing escrow and mediation services for a fee.  The gift cards would typically be purchased at a steep discount because they aren't as liquid as cash or bitcoin.  “You want 10 euros worth of bitcoin, OK give me a 20 euro gift card,” Brian McCabe, who served as head of product marketing at Paxful from February 2018 to 2021, recalled in an interview.  Turn to emerging markets  Eventually, when U.S.-based Backpage was shut down, Paxful’s sex worker customer base disappeared. The company’s good fortune persisted, however, when soon after the Backpage shutdown, new demand for a peer-to-peer platform beckoned in Nigeria, China and other emerging markets, where bitcoin was seen as a viable alternative in locales with less reliable currencies and payment systems.  The company went through an explosive growth phase. Paxful’s website states that the four offices were located in New York City; Tallinn, Estonia; Hong Kong and Manila, Philippines.  The company’s compliance, legal, sales and marketing teams were based in New York where Youssef primarily worked, according to a former employee. The development, product and user-interface teams were based in Tallinn. Schaback says he worked out of multiple locations.  It was during that period of meteoric growth that Schaback and Youssef started to butt heads.  Five months after the Miami Beach incident, in February 2017, according to court documents filed by Schaback, Youssef was arrested once again, this time in Tallinn “on suspicion of drug trafficking after allegedly purchasing illegal drugs including MDMA (also known as ecstasy) and steroids multiple times through the dark web.”  Schaback cited posts on the website Glassdoor where employees supposedly said Youssef held meetings while under the influence of drugs.  In a filing in the Delaware case, Youssef responded that he suspected the Glassdoor complaints might have been made by Schaback himself or by “others acting in concert with him,” though he did admit to serving a sentence in connection with a guilty plea on a drug-related offense in Estonia.  Lavish spending, at least back in Paxful’s salad days, was a staple of working there, former employees recall.  McCabe says in 2018, Paxful flew the entire company to Belgium for the biggest electronic dance music festival in Europe.  “We were there for a week,” McCabe said. “On a retreat at a five-star hotel.”  In 2016, Paxful employed a 25-year-old Brazilian man as a computer and network technician who separately came under investigation by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration for his role as moderator of a darknet marketplace “WSM,” where drugs, hacking tools and stolen financial data were exchanged, with payments made in virtual currencies such as bitcoin and monero (XMR), according to an affidavit filed in connection with the case in 2019.  Abrupt decisions to fire an employee seemed to have been the norm at Paxful, McCabe recalls.  Youssef ""loves to praise you, and one day he gets into a mood and decides to fire you for reasons that seem to be made up,” McCabe said. Schaback was “quieter and holds back things before he says them.”  Ivan Suhharev, Paxful’s former chief technology officer (and the third man arrested with Youssef and Schaback in Miami Beach in 2016), claimed to be a victim of an abrupt firing. He was suddenly terminated from his role in April 2020 for “egregious conduct.” The co-founders then demanded that Suhharev fork over nearly $300,000 in excess profit share paid to him in prior years.  As a shareholder with more than 765,000 Paxful common shares, the former employee filed a complaint with the Supreme Court of New York in May 2021 demanding access to the company’s books and records. The case was dismissed in November 2021.  Paxful Inc. had a net profit of $5.47 million in 2018 and $3.63 million in 2019, according to a Nov. 3, 2020, letter from the company that was included as an exhibit in Suhharev's case.  The company in the late 2010s and into the early 2020s pushed aggressively into markets, including Nigeria, Kenya, Russia, Sri Lanka and elsewhere. In July 2018, Youssef described to CoinDesk Paxful’s plans to open an office in hyperinflation-ridden Venezuela, though in September 2020 the company announced it was pulling out, citing “concerns regarding the regulatory landscape around Venezuela and Paxful’s own risk tolerance.”  Through it all, Youssef became a sort of go-to expert for CoinDesk and other crypto media on bitcoin adoption in emerging markets, commenting on all manner of trends and specific news events.  In the statement sent to CoinDesk, Youssef said of his co-founder: ""The money changed him, and he adopted a lavish lifestyle and began showing off. This was not congruent with the mission of the company. A group of sycophants began to form around him, attracted by his nightly bottle service parties and spending.""  In 2021, Schaback welcomed his first child and went on paternity leave in October of that year, a move he claims marked the beginning of his 15-month-long feud with Youssef.  Court documents filed by both Schaback and Youssef clearly show that the pair were co-founders of Paxful and were the only two members on Paxful's board. The men each owned 50% of Paxful's Class B common stock.  The office smelled like weed  Schaback alleged in his suit that Youssef’s behavior became “increasingly erratic” during the period when he was out. He alleged that Youssef hatched a plan to undermine him in his absence and assert control over Paxful.  Schaback’s court documents state that Youssef attended management meetings under the influence of “unspecified substances,” and McCabe said the allegations were consistent with his own observations.  “I wouldn’t say smoking in meetings,” McCabe said. “But during virtual meetings, he would smoke CBD and weed in the office all the time and it would smell like it.”  Youssef didn’t immediately respond to a question about the alleged drug use. New York legalized recreational marijuana use in 2021.  “The conspiracy theories are madness,” Youssef told CoinDesk. “He even sued our general counsel who is an awesome guy and he resigned. We lost seven executives because of him.”  Schaback eventually returned to the office on Jan. 31, 2022, and says it wasn’t long before he realized how much things had changed. In his suit, Schaback says access to company resources, like his email address and Slack account, had been cut off and his corporate credit card had been blocked. His COO title had been removed.  In a conversation at a later point, Youssef suggested that Schaback accept a lesser role as an executive vice president, the filings state. “Schaback rejected that.”  'Like some kind of horrible divorce'  In late 2020, according to Youssef’s filing in the Delaware court case, Schaback brought in auditors to work with Paxful’s top engineers.  “Paxful’s employees quickly realized that these purported ‘auditors’ were merely Schaback’s friends who did not possess any qualifications and could not possibly bring any value to the company,” the filing reads. “After a company party, for example, the head ‘auditor’ became too intoxicated to control himself and admitted as much to several Paxful employees, stating, ‘Guys, don’t worry, we are here just to make some money from Paxful, and after that, we are gone.’”  According to Youssef: “Schaback’s serial misdeeds led to Paxful retaining outside counsel to conduct an internal investigation into his conduct, during which time Schaback’s access to company offices and systems was suspended, in accordance with company policies. Schaback refused to cooperate with the investigation, no doubt aware that his cooperation would lead to the inevitable conclusion that he should be disciplined due to his disloyal conduct.”  “It was like some kind of horrible divorce,” Youssef said. “He was fired over a year ago for several things, namely incompetence and bad behavior. He refused to partake in the internal investigation. He was legally fired.”  Schaback claims the investigation was a sham, saying it was an attempt to limit his activities, oversight and knowledge of Paxful internal activities, and he accused Youssef of “draining, misappropriating and outright stealing Paxful resources and profits.”  Half of the board  Schaback claims his suspension was unlawful, given that it hadn’t been authorized by Paxful’s board of directors.  “It wasn’t official because only the board can fire me as the COO and I’m half of the board and there was no evidence they found to fire me,” he told CoinDesk.  The internal investigation ordered by Youssef closed on June 9, 2022 with no evidence of wrongdoing by Schaback, according to his suit, and he continued in his position as officer and director of the company, even though he was terminated as an employee.  Schaback claims Youssef tried to erase him from Paxful’s corporate story, with no mention of him as the COO on the website, and that only Youssef’s picture appeared as the founder.  On Aug. 23, 2022, Youssef tweeted, “I have no cofounders.”  It was during this time that Schaback claims Youssef sent payments for “media consulting” of up to $30,000 a month to a woman with whom he was romantically involved. Schaback wasn’t aware any such service was needed and has requested documents related to the service, which haven’t been provided.  Youssef mostly denied the allegations in a court filing, though further explanation was redacted from the public version.  According to Schaback’s suit, Youssef made large transfers of bitcoin to Russia-based entities affiliated with Paxful and created a new entity for Paxful’s employees and operations in Russia, which they named ""Dekslektika."" The entities were run by two people not related to Paxful.  “Youssef and his cohorts conceived of and formed Dekslektika as part of an illegal plan to avoid international sanctions on transactions into and out of Russia,” Schaback said, claiming that they planned to allow illegal transitions of bitcoin in and out of Russia to avoid violations of sanctions at the time.  In his statement to CoinDesk, Youssef said: ""Paxful has long since stopped serving new Russian users and divested away from Russian, Belarus and all CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) countries, further invalidating his insane accusations.""  In September, according to Schaback, Youssef asked to buy out Paxful’s other shareholders, but the offer was rejected.  According to Youseff, he and Schaback equally hold all of the company’s stock except for 10% of the Class A common shares, held by three individuals.  Schaback says that Youssef attempted to “bully” him into selling his shares by threatening to sue him if he didn’t agree to resign from his positions.  After a few more attempts to seize control of the company, including trying to transfer Paxful’s assets to a shell company, Youseff on Jan. 7 tweeted that he “finally achieved victory,” and “one day all shall be revealed.”  Three days later, on Jan. 10, Schaback filed his complaints against Youssef and Paxful in the Delaware court.  In interviews and social-media posts last week, Youssef was already starting to recommend alternatives to Paxful, including an upcoming platform called Civilization Kit, or Civ Kit, while Schaback says he wants to revive Paxful as soon as the lawsuit is settled.  “I know Ray’s counterargument will be that all employees have left and it’s impossible to relaunch the product because all the knowledge is gone,” Schaback said to CoinDesk.  One lesson for startup founders might be found in the pitfalls of the duarchy that was Paxful’s corporate structure.  “Paxful has a two-member board, and Youssef and Schaback have served as Paxful’s two directors since the company’s founding,” Youssef acknowledged in the Delaware court case. “There is a two-thirds director vote requirement for the board to act. Thus, as Youssef and Schaback are Paxful’s only directors, both directors must vote in favor of an action presented for board approval for it to be valid.”  The filing concludes: “Youssef and Schaback are therefore on the road to being hopelessly deadlocked as Class B stockholders and co-directors regarding the proper course of action for Paxful.”  UPDATE (April 9, 19:09 UTC): Adds comments from Youssef in statement sent to CoinDesk after publication.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,"Frederick Munawa, Helene Braun",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/04/08/drugs-erratic-dismissals-and-feuding-founders-behind-bitcoin-marketplace-paxfuls-unraveling,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5fa54f3183f409c3f6e652f48f2fc0b17dcfdbd4-680x383.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

11549373,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=526116,1680960727,"Cardano’s TVL Set For Exponential Growth, TapTools Reports","Prominent blockchain Cardano is set to experience “exponential growth” in its Total Value Locked (TVL), according to a report by Cardano portfolio tracker TapTools. In a thread on April 7, TapTools urged its 15,000 followers to keep a close eye on Cardano while stating the possible factors that can drive the expected explosive growth on the blockchain platform. Innovation, Partnerships And Community To Drive Cardano’s TVL: TapTools Based on the TapTools report, one factor that should boost Cardano’s TVL is its innovative Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, which TapTools believes makes the blockchain a top contender in the next phase of DeFi adoption. According to the team behind the asset tracker, Cardano’s unique PoS mechanism offers users a secure, scalable and eco-friendly solution that could benefit the platform, especially with the projected massive growth of the DeFi space. TapTools also highlighted Cardano’s focus on financial inclusivity and real-world use cases as another possible key driver in the platform’s development. The team stated that this strategy enables Cardano to penetrate emerging markets allowing more users to join the network and boosting its TVL value. Related Reading: Chiliz Hot Streak Sees CHZ Notching 13% Rally Ahead Of Chain 2.0 Launch Another noteworthy point stated in the TapTools report is the role of strategic partnerships and collaborations in Cardano’s network growth. TapTools noted that Cardano’s partnerships with various industry giants would facilitate increased network adoption, thereby boosting its TVL growth in the coming years. That said, other factors stated in the TapTools report that could drive Cardano’s growth include its smart contract operations and its thriving community of developers, enthusiasts and investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Hits All-Time High For The 4th Time In 2023: Here’s Why Cardano’s TVL Growth Has Been Impressive So Far For many of the Cardano user community, the report by TapTools only produces more excitement as the platform’s TVL has been on a steady rise following the turn of the new year. According to data from Defillama, Cardano’s TVL has boosted by about 200% from its initial value of $48.95 million on January 1. On March 22, Cardano’s TVL crossed $140 million for the first time since June 2022. That said, the current TVL of Cardano stands at $143.16 million, with an increase of 31.98% in 30 days. The decentralized exchange Minswap is the biggest protocol on the blockchain, with a market dominance of 37.37%. Source: Defillama Meanwhile, ADA, Cardano’s native cryptocurrency, has also recorded a price growth synonymous with the platform TVL’s movement. Based on data from Coingecko, ADA is up by 22.6% in the last 30 days , however, its total gain since the beginning of the year is estimated to be around 62.5%. At the time of writing, ADA is trading at $0.39, gaining by 2.8% on the last day. Its daily trading volume is around $228.68 million.

11544013,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=526067,1680947835,Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Hits All-Time High For The 4th Time In 2023: Here’s Why,"Bitcoin mining difficulty continues to break records despite the struggles of BTC to surpass the $30,000 resistance mark. The leading coin has attracted the interest of miners in recent months due to the price recovery experienced since the turn of the year. Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Hits New Record Bitcoin mining difficulty moved to an all-time high on April 6, 2023, following the most recent mining difficulty adjustment on its blockchain network. The mining difficulty rose for the fourth consecutive time and reached 47.8 trillion, an increase of 2.3%. The Bitcoin mining difficulty automatically adjusts every 2,016 blocks – approximately two weeks – to maintain the 10-minute block creation time. There has been a steady increase in mining difficulty in recent weeks, with the last downward trend recorded on February 11. One of the consequences is reflected in the hash price, which is the rate of profit miners make for the hashrate they provide to the Bitcoin network. In theory, a higher mining difficulty leads to a lower hash price. This is because more miners are contributing computing power than normal, leading to more competition for the rewards that the Bitcoin network provides miners that produce new blocks on the network. Related Reading: Buckle Up! Bitcoin Bollinger Bands Signal An Impending Rollercoaster Ride Furthermore, the Bitcoin hashrate or processing power can indicate the degree of mining difficulty. At the time of the mining difficulty adjustment that preceded the latest one, BTC’s hash rate was at a record high leading to increased mining difficulty. However, this has changed recently, with the hashrate falling by an average of 20 EH/s this week. It should be noted that Bitcoin’s hashrate varies as measured by different sources. For example, BTC.com places the metric at 338 EH/s, and mempool places this at a slightly higher metric of 347/ EH/s Bullish Market A Major Reason For Increased Mining Difficulty Bitcoin has appreciated by more than 50% since the start of 2023, leading to calls for a bullish market. Unsurprisingly this positive trend has led to many miners reconnecting their equipment after a difficult 2022. Related Reading: Uniswap Who? Trader Joe’s AMM Takes DeFi By Storm The collapse of Terra Luna and subsequent fallout from FTX led to significant bearish pressure on the market, with several coins taking steep price declines. Bitcoin was one of the coins to dip, leading to a difficult year for miners, with many having to sell their equipment or shut down operations to stay afloat. However, the bull run of 2023 has raised expectations from miners that the market could be on its way to previous levels. Nonetheless, the crypto mining sector has not been without its difficulties, with friendly places like Texas in the United States planning to tighten regulations on electricity that could affect the booming sector soon.

Adding to the regulatory complexity, March also saw the implosion of several important crypto-banking institutions, amid broader banking sector panic. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced double-digit percentage increases in March. With Hong Kong set to unveil its digital asset regulatory framework, Chinese SOE banks have stepped up their relationships with crypto firms in HK and elsewhere. If deglobalization accelerates, we believe censorship-resistant bearer assets with predictable supply, such as Bitcoin and Gold, will comprise an increasing proportion of global reserves. Hong Kong's new digital asset framework coincides with U.S. crypto crackdown. Could Bitcoin's rise be driven by state-sponsored buyers & global interest amid deglobalization? Please note that VanEck may have a position(s) in the digital asset(s) described below. ""There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose."" - John Maynard Keynes In March, there was a significant variation in digital asset returns, with both Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) experiencing double-digit percentage increases, even as other sectors we track fell more than 10%. Returns were correlated to size, with the MarketVector digital assets 100 Large-cap index rising 13% while the digital assets 100 small-cap index fell 9%. For the month, Bitcoin +22%, Ethereum +11%, vs. Nasdaq composite +7%, and the S&P 500 +3%. Macro, Regulation, & Bitcoin We highlighted coming into the year that improving liquidity, especially in China, might lead to Bitcoin price strength if past relationships held. Indeed, as both the PBOC’s reverse repo hit record levels in Q1 and M2 growth accelerated to 13% y/y, a 5-year high, we observed the Bitcoin price acting better on days with bigger liquidity injections from the PBOC. In addition, with HK set to unveil its digital asset regulatory framework, giving access to retail investors for the first time, Chinese SOE banks have stepped up their relationships with crypto firms in HK and elsewhere, according to multiple media reports. In our opinion, U.S. dollar hegemony is facing its biggest threat in decades as China, Saudi Arabia, India, and now notably Japan, among others, subvert global sanctions on Russia to secure sustainable, affordable energy supplies. Indonesia president Jokowi summarized the backlash to Washington’s dollar weaponization on March 22nd when he proposed phasing out Visa ( V ) & Mastercard ( MA ) , according to RT, who quoted him as saying: “Be very careful. We must remember the sanctions imposed by the U.S. on Russia. Visa & Mastercard could be a problem.” During the month, the VanEck research team met with a Chinese Bitcoin mining machine manufacturer who told us that Saudi Arabia and other Middle East countries’ state-associated funds are currently tendering large Bitcoin ASICs orders, likely to make progress after Ramadan’s conclusion on April 20th. We think the Bitcoin price has run up sharply this year partially on expectations of these new state-sponsored Bitcoin buyers, in overt contradiction to the U.S. regulatory agencies’ hostile approach to the sector. For context, foreign holdings of U.S. treasury securities are languishing at a 10-year low, down 13% in the last 6 months, according to the U.S. Treasury. If deglobalization accelerates, we believe censorship-resistant bearer assets with predictable supply, such as Bitcoin and Gold , will comprise an increasing proportion of global reserves. Previous Cycles Suggest that Bitcoin will Rally Prior to and After the Next Halving Source: Arcana. Data as of 2/4/2023. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Staying on the topic of regulation, the U.S.’s multi-agency crackdown on crypto reached a fever pitch in March with the New York Attorney General (NYAG) suing exchange Kucoin ( KCS-USD ) over their business practices, the CFTC bringing charges against Binance ( BNB-USD ) for allegedly operating an unregistered futures exchange, and the SEC issuing Coinbase ( COIN ) a “Wells Notice.” To complicate matters further, there is an ongoing turf war between the SEC and the CFTC to determine the crypto regulatory domains of each entity. While the SEC is tasked with overseeing “securities,” the CFTC is in charge of governing “commodities.” This divide is settled in traditional finance, but how each agency’s regulatory powers relate to various cryptocurrencies is currently undecided despite each agency claiming overlapping suzerainty over crypto. The chief battleground in this fight is whether ETH is a “security” or “commodity,” which would determine regulatory jurisdiction. After a late February assertion by SEC Chairman Gary Gensler that “everything else other than Bitcoin is a security” and the March 9 declaration by the NYAG that ETH was a security in court documents, it seemed the SEC was winning the battle. However, pushback occurred when the Chairman of the CFTC, Rostin Behnam, said the agency had a “direct jurisdictional hook” to regulate ETH, the commodity on March 9th and again in the CFTC complaint documents against Binance launched on March 27. While many crypto participants believe the CFTC would be a more accommodating regulator than the SEC, it appears that being caught between two government entities competing through “regulation by enforcement” is both the “rock” and the “hard place.” Settling the matter through legislation is the optimal solution, but this appears unlikely until after the 2024 election. Thus, we expect regulatory limbo and the potential for follow-up “tape bombs” while reminding investors & regulators alike that the United States of America is still a nation of laws and crypto will have its day in court. Adding to the regulatory complexity, March also saw the implosion of several important crypto-banking institutions, including Silvergate ( SI ) and Signature Bank ( SBNY ), amid broader banking sector panic. Silvergate failing is a material loss to the crypto industry as Silvergate’s SEN network enabled crypto market makers and related parties to send and receive USD instantly. The result has been a marked decrease in crypto liquidity as the bid/ask spreads increased, and market depth receded. SVB’s ( SIVBQ ) failure also prompted a dramatic depeg of the much-trusted stablecoin USDC (USDC-USD) from its dollar mark. This result occurred because Circle , the company behind USDC, held $3.3B in reserves at Silicon Valley Bank. When U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen announced that the U.S. government would backstop depositors at SVB, the price of USDC quickly recovered to its peg at $1.00. Still, despite the recoup of the $1.00-mark, faith in USDC has been shaken, and the result has been outflows from USDC of $9.3B since March 9, or around 22.7% of its total supply. The practical conclusion to the increased regulatory enforcement appears to be the strengthening of certain incumbents, such as Tether ( USDT-USD ) , Coinbase, and Bitcoin, at the expense of a long tail of crypto exchanges and projects that do not have the resources to fight multiple regulatory battles and would prefer to retrench or go offshore during the crypto winter. Meanwhile, new banks are emerging to service the industry - ask for a list. The next Silvergate is more likely to be offshore, with more fragile correspondent banking relationships in the U.S. Market Capitalization USDC vs. Tether Source: Arcana as of 3/28/2023. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Layer-1s Despite the heated regulatory environment in March, the market capitalization of smart contract platforms rose from $297B to $321B thanks to notable strength from ETH (+11%) & BNB (+4%), and Cardano ( ADA-USD ) (+6%). The biggest losers of the month were Near ( NEAR-USD ) (-16%) and Cosmos ( ATOM-USD ) (-11%). While Ethereum usership was flat in the month of March, the ETH token appreciated partly because of the sound execution of the Ethereum roadmap. In this respect, Ethereum’s vision of scaling through offboarding transaction execution to layer-2s is progressing well, as the amount of L2 gas usage (how much of Ethereum’s blockspace is occupied by L2 transactions) in March reached 17% vs. less than 5% at the end of 2022. In our view, initiatives that significantly enhance user experience will play a crucial role in promoting Ethereum's widespread adoption. This requires infrastructure that enables Ethereum wallets to rival the simplicity of conventional online banking. On that front, we believe the introduction of Ethereum’s ERC-4337 Account Abstraction Upgrade is the second most important Ethereum upgrade (after the Merge) and will be a key contributing factor in boosting confidence in Ethereum's commitment to reaching a larger audience. An audited version of ERC-4337 became available on the Ethereum mainnet in March. It will enable two-factor authentication, setting monthly spending limits on an account, the use of session keys to play blockchain games without constantly having to approve transactions, decentralized recovery of wallets, and configuration to autopay bills and subscriptions. L2 Transaction Settlement Share of Ethereum Source: Dune as of 4/3/2023. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Going forward, we are also keeping a close eye on Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solutions that involve a technology called Zero-Knowledge roll-ups . Layer-2 roll-ups are a solution that allows the execution of transactions to happen off the Ethereum chain. The data from these transactions is compressed and posted to Ethereum to ensure authenticity and data storage. Currently, the dominant form of L2 roll-ups that exist are called optimistic roll-ups. Optimistic roll-ups post data onto Ethereum, which has a seven-day window that allows outside parties to challenge their authenticity. The result is that the roll-ups and transactions they execute can be rolled back if fraud is detected over that window of seven days. The issue is that users cannot trust their transactions to be truly final until that seven-day challenge period has passed. By contrast, Zero-Knowledge (ZK) roll-ups post proof of accuracy alongside the transaction data. Due to this property, ZK roll-ups are considered more promising over the long term for scaling Ethereum – which could result in transaction throughput increases to 1000x what it is today. Two important ZK-roll ups were launched in March, and these are zkSync’s Era and Polygon’s ( MATIC-USD ) zkEVM . Thus far, Era has dominated the ZK landscape with more than 40x the TVL as zkEVM. Still, it is early on in the adoption of ZK-roll ups, and many speculate users are migrating assets to Era for airdrops (distribution of rewards to early users). In any case, Era’s early lead is immense. TVL Comparison: Era vs zkEVM ($M) Source: Dune as of 3/31/2023. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. As for BNB, we partly attribute the Binance coin’s strength in March to a dramatic improvement in daily active addresses, up 28% compared to February, increasing to 1.22M. BNB token price also benefited from the release of BNB’s new roadmap, which promises to triple the chain’s validator count, enable a 12x transaction throughput increase to 5,000 TPS, deploy ZK roll-ups through zkBNB , and launch the BNB Greenfield decentralized storage project. BNB, despite the recent legal action against it, has an intense focus on creating interesting, inexpensive products that copy the best from other ecosystems and bring it to the lower-value users. This approach, mirroring the weapons export business aimed at bargain users of the Soviets during the Cold War, has earned it an average of 1 million daily active users, which is more than double the next highest chain, Ethereum.

Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Cardano , despite flat usership, outperformed in part due to an important governance upgrade called CIP-1694. This improvement inches Cardano towards an important roadmap mile marker called the Age of Voltaire, which introduces decentralization by enabling a token-based voting system for Cardano treasury management and chain upgrades. Then on March 30, Milkomeda, a Layer-2 to Cardano, launched the capability to deploy smart contracts using Solidity. This layer-2 EVM capability brings smart contract language and functionality – something sorely lacking in Cardano over the past few years. Among laggards in March, Cosmos and NEAR fell 16% and -11%, respectively. NEAR’s price is languishing due to a clear loss in adoption despite interesting announcements in March, such as the Blockchain Operating System, which allows a common layer for browsing Web3 applications, and a gaming partnership with South Korean powerhouse Kakao Games . Since the beginning of March, NEAR’s daily active addresses are down -17.3%, its TVL has dropped -34.9%, and transactions are down -9.1%. On the other hand, the issues of Cosmos relate less to on-chain metrics than they do the continued dysfunction of the Cosmos community combined with the lack of execution and clarity surrounding Cosmos’s long-term business model. Despite encouraging developments, such as the announcement of USDC deploying natively to Cosmos and the passage of Cosmos’s first iteration of its business model, Replicated Security, community drama drowned out the positive news. Ongoing Twitter spats, notably between Cosmos co-founder Jae Kwon and basically the remainder of the community, have devolved into a legal battle between Kwon’s entity and a former employee of Kwon’s entity. This lawsuit may extend further to other major Cosmos figures and is indicative of vision disagreement among the major entities in the Cosmos. The most recent spat contributes to a picture of a divided ecosystem many assumed was holding Cosmos back. Specifically, at least eight separate entities are focusing on developing the Cosmos Hub. While most of these organizations share many common goals, they differ markedly on major portions of the Cosmos roadmap, and this was demonstrated when the ATOM 2.0 plan was rejected last year. Despite the stalled progress, we continue to be bulls on the Cosmos as it offers a unique community, value proposition, and architecture that is well-differentiated from Ethereum.
