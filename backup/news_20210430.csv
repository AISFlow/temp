42406302,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetSen,1619820355,"South Korea’s Crypto Legal Framework Is Insufficient, Lawmaker Says","South Korean lawmaker Kim Byung-wook said he believes the crypto industry is unique and different from traditional finance, and thus requires a separate regulatory framework.      That isn’t a new refrain for Kim, who has repeatedly advocated for crypto-specific legislation. The government’s current method of regulating Korea’s cryptocurrency industry is by applying anti-money laundering (AML) laws and know-your-customer (KYC) protocols to crypto exchanges.      Crypto is in a gray area. Exchanges will be monitored by the country’s financial regulator, the Financial Services Commission (FSC), but the government doesn’t recognize bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as financial assets. The government will begin collecting taxes on crypto profits starting Jan. 1, but because crypto isn’t recognized as a financial asset, it will be taxed as income. All annual profits from crypto trading exceeding 2.5 million won ($2,252) will be taxed as “other income” at a rate of 20%.      Korea’s capital gains tax is also 20%. but it currently applies only to annual capital gains of 1 billion won ($900,596) or more. The Finance Ministry is planning on lowering the limit to 50 million won ($45,045) starting 2023.      The U.S., the U.K. and France view profits from crypto trading as capital gains, while Japan has adopted a similar stance to South Korea’s. The tax on short-term capital gains in the U.S. goes up to 37%, while the long-term rate is about 20%. President Biden has said he may propose raising the rate to over 40%.      Kim told CoinDesk Korea he agreed that crypto should be taxed, but he argued that establishing a legislative and regulatory framework should be the priority. He said it’s “problematic” for the government to view crypto as taxable without providing any legal protection for traders.      “Taxing any sort of financial profit is a given, but we need to first establish a legal and administrative framework that applies specifically to crypto and virtual assets,” Kim said.      South Korea Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki said during a press conference on April 27 that “the FSC’s position is that cryptocurrency isn’t really a financial asset,” and he noted that taxing crypto as income is “inevitable.”      On April 22, Eun Sung-soo, head of the FSC, said that the government isn’t responsible for protecting crypto traders from scams or fraud, because crypto trading is “inherently speculative.” Eun compared investing in crypto to gambling. He also suggested any exchanges that don’t register with financial authorities would be shut down.      Regarding the FSC head’s comments about exchanges being shut down, Kim said, “Authorities currently don’t even know how many exchanges there are in the country, how coins are listed and what kind of protections they offer to traders.”      “One of the reasons the crypto market is so overheated is because there is no regulatory framework,” he added.      Kim also pointed to the lack of any standardized procedure for listing coins and preventing fraudulent initial coin offerings in South Korea, citing the GoMoney2 and Arowana incidents as examples.      On March 17, the issuer of the GoMoney2 (GOM2) token announced that the project had secured an investment of 5 trillion won (around $4.5 billion) from the wallet service Celsius, but Celsius posted a tweet on March 18 that it had made no investment in GoMoney2. Upbit, one of Korea’s largest exchanges, delisted the GOM2 token the next day.      On April 20, the Arowana (ARW) token was listed on another major exchange, Bithumb. The price of Arowana rose over 100,000% within 30 minutes after being listed.      Many observers have suspected market manipulation by insiders within Hancom. HancomWITH, a subsidiary of Korean software firm Hancom, invested in the Arowana network through its Singapore branch on April 13, inspiring many Koreans to nickname Arowana the “Hancom coin.” Both Hancom and Bithumb have denied any knowledge of market manipulation.      At the time of writing, there has been no official investigation into the Arowana project. As of April 30 around 15:00 UTC, it is trading at about 15,670 won (about $14). On the day it was listed, the price went as high as 53,800 won ($48).      Kim has been working with CoinDesk Korea and legal experts since last July to formulate a blueprint for basic crypto regulation and push for crypto-specific legislation.      “We need virtual asset legislation that will allow Korea’s blockchain industry to prosper while protecting traders from fraud,” Kim said. “Otherwise we will fall behind in a burgeoning global industry.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Felix Im,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/30/south-koreas-crypto-legal-framework-is-insufficient-lawmaker-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/29900b7d3597ad0f9a5c209176ad085c44116d00-1500x1002.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Previously, the trust had only been open to a handful of Valkyrie clients.      The trust is seeing interest from institutions as well as firms like dental clinics and car dealerships, McClurg said. Several clients are putting excess cash into bitcoin as a liquid asset to earn yield, he added.      “Some of these companies that have excess cash that aren't being used for operations, they're putting a significant portion of their access cash into bitcoin through the trust,” McClurg said. “In many cases, it is north of 50%.”      The trust has a 40 basis-point management fee that doesn’t include some smaller custodial fees that should disappear as assets under management grow, McClurg said. He declined to reveal the fund’s current AUM.      This comes well below the 2% fee that Grayscale, the world’s largest digital asset manager, charges on the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and well under the 0.49% management fee that Osprey charges on its closed-end bitcoin fund.

With the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies soaring, institutional investment in the market on the rise and a new wave of hype around digitized art with non-fungible tokens (NFTs), everyone is either talking about crypto or thinking about it. If this isn't your first bull run, you’re familiar with the feeling of exuberance – and concern – that's probably hitting you right now like a date with your crush.      To help balance those feelings – with knowledge – CoinDesk created the Unlocked interactive explainer series. It made its debut last year at Consensus: Distributed, and this year for Consensus by CoinDesk, we've expanded the series to include Unlocked 101, a free three-week series designed for an audience that is still wrapping their head around the technology. Folks who maybe bought a little bitcoin and are wondering why everyone keeps telling them to HODL; people who want to change their profession to yield farmer but aren't quite sure if they need a pitchfork; bitcoin plebs who are intaking so much news on the topic but can't tell what's signal versus noise.    We will explore the basics of Bitcoin, DeFi, hacks and scams and the NFT boom at Unlocked 101, a free crash course running May 4-20 ahead of Consensus by CoinDesk, our virtual big-tent event. Register for Unlocked 101.    Even after all these years (I first got into crypto in 2012), I still have lots of questions. As the industry expands and the complexity increases ... well, sometimes I'm just as lost as the next n00b. And I've always been a learn-by-doing kinda woman, and I believe that getting hands-on with the technology is the best way to appreciate its power. Not to mention, pushing the button – whether it's send, stake or mint – is intimidating, and, yes, I'll admit it, I want someone to hold my hand through that process.      So whether you’re just beginning your journey into crypto or need a refresher, the best place to immerse yourself is at CoinDesk’s Unlocked 101 series of free sessions in the lead-up to our annual industry conference, Consensus by CoinDesk. Sessions start May 4 and will be held every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday during the first three weeks of May.

Grayscale Investments, the world’s largest digital asset manager, which is owned by CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group, has incorporated a DOT trust but has yet to launch it.      “Polkadot has the promise of being a faster network, with lower gas fees that can support a lot of different assets,” Steven McClurg, Valkyrie’s chief investment officer, said in an interview. “It is more of a speculative play on the future growth and future usability of that protocol.”    See also: Osprey Funds Launches Polkadot Trust    Many of the same institutions that are interested in Osprey’s bitcoin fund are also interested in the DOT fund, Osprey CEO Greg King said.      “It’s pretty compelling as a potential layer one platform that facilitates a multichain universe,” King said.

Meanwhile, the ether market seems to be decoupling from bitcoin, for now.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $56,996 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 7.5% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $52,604-$57,219 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC above the 10-hour and the 50-hour moving averages on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price made gains Friday. At around 17:00 UTC (12 p.m. ET), the world’s oldest cryptocurrency hit $57,219, according to CoinDesk 20 data. Bitcoin's price Friday jumped over $4,600 within a 24-hour period, settling a bit as of press time, at $56,996.      “One reason we may be seeing the upswing in bitcoin's price is because of the expiration of $4.2 billion in bitcoin options contracts today,” noted Steve Ehrlich, chief executive officer at investment firm Voyager Digital. “Historically, there have been price dips in the days leading up to a bitcoin options expiry, only for it to rebound thereafter.”      For most of this week, bitcoin’s price struggled to make gains. The last time bitcoin traded at the $57,000 level was almost two weeks ago, on April 17.      “What we're experiencing is likely the rebound, which further confirms the continued bullishness around bitcoin,"" Ehrlich said.      The options expiration may have caused some traders to return to the spot market Friday as buyers pushed the price up, noted Nate Cox, the chief investment officer of crypto brokerage Two Prime. “The majority of long calls and puts for the April monthly contracts are expiring worthless,” Cox said. “Needless to say, bitcoin didn't move the way many derivative traders expected this month.”      Read More: Bitcoin Jumps 6% to $57K as Market Shrugs Off $4B+ Options Expiry      This momentum may subside, however. It appears that options traders are not overly bullish on bitcoin holding the $60,000 level anytime soon. Based on market data aggregated by Skew, options expiring May 21 are positions such that there’s only a 38% chance bitcoin will reach $60,000 on that date, with a 53% probability of $56,000 and a 74% probability of BTC over $50,000.      Voyager’s Ehrlich said that it appears more money is pouring into the ecosystem Friday because many assets are also up – a plus for the entire crypto market.      ""Alongside BTC’s positive momentum, we are also seeing upwards price movement in other altcoins such as DOT, XLM, AVAX, LINK, LTC, ALGO, DASH and ICX in the last 24 hours,” said Ehrlich. “This indicates that traders remain bullish on the entire spectrum of crypto assets, and are not moving away from altcoins into bitcoin.”    Ether is surprisingly flat; is it decoupled from BTC?    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading around $2,786 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), up 1.9% over the prior 24 hours.      After hitting fresh record highs several times this week, ether was struggling to make gains Friday, a stark contrast from the bitcoin price pop. Analysts are mixed on whether ether’s correlation is completely decoupled from bitcoin.      “ETH now has a completely different play, making the most due to the DeFi projects,” noted Constantine Kogan, partner at investment firm Wave Financial. “My guess is they will be more and more decorrelated.”      Decentralized finance, or DeFi, is certainly showing fundamentals that signal continued growth; total value locked has now crossed $65 billion for that market.      Some of this gain is a function of price, but the amount of crypto deposited remains steady, meaning investors are not withdrawing crypto from DeFi to deploy elsewhere, which is a bullish sign.      Darius Sit, chief investment office of quantitative firm QCP Capital, noted the ETH/BTC trading pair, a popular one offered on most crypto exchanges, indicates there was some selling today of ether into bitcoin.      “ETH/BTC had been going up, so this is just some mean reversion, I guess,” Sit told CoinDesk.      ETH/BTC is down 5% on Coinbase as of press time.

42406314,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetSmf,1619808077,"With Bitcoin 'Bear Markets' Like These, Who Needs the Bulls?","The first half of 2021 has so far offered some significant opportunities for bitcoin bears to be wrong. The most salient of them came this past Sunday, when the bitcoin price suddenly dropped to $47,073.37, down from a freshly set all-time high (just 11 days old), of $64,888.99.      That drop of 27.5% in less than two weeks put bitcoin into bear market territory, at least as far as the normal definition of a bear market is concerned. In equities, the term “bear market” usually applies when prices drop by 20% or more. But bitcoin's price recovered quickly from the dip, and it seems clear that crypto's market regime is unchanged, at least for now. Bitcoin seems to demand a different standard to define bull and bear markets: The 20% dips come too frequently, and are often just part of a broader run-up.      Last weekend's dip wasn't the first time in 2021 that a price drop of 20% or more prompted headlines proclaiming a bear market. ""Bitcoin is now in a bear market, get used to it,"" one headline proclaimed on Jan. 25. On that day, bitcoin hit a daily low of $30,480.27, per the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX). In the next two days, it would plumb weekly lows just below $30,000 before rallying to a new all-time high of $58,353.78 three weeks later.      The chart above illustrates how wrong that was, with call-outs showing the price rally following Jan. 25. Similarly, it may take some time to tell what the April 25 dip means. It's possible the $64,889 all-time high, set on April 13, was the top ahead of a bear market. Or, bitcoin could continue to repeat its 2021 pattern of setting a new all-time high, then falling back below recent averages only to set a fresh all-time high weeks later.      To be defined as a bull- or bear-market regime, a market condition has to last more than a few weeks. With that in mind, we developed the following criteria to define bull and bear markets in bitcoin's history. Understanding bitcoin's cycles can be helpful for understanding the crypto market because bitcoin is the bellwether for all crypto assets. Bitcoin moves from bull to bear market, or vice versa, when:    There is a price change greater than 20%  The price does not return within 90 days to the high or low that preceded the change    As you can see from the chart above, based on our definition the duration of bull and bear cycles contracted between 2018 and 2020. However, the current bull market, which began after the COVID-19 price crash in March 2020, has lasted 407 days and counting, as of Tuesday when this chart was created.      In the absence of a consensus on fundamentals or macro correlations for crypto, cyclical analyses like this one can be helpful to investors seeking to interpret market dynamics. (For weekly insights like this one, subscribe to CoinDesk Indexes' Monday newsletter, The Hard Fork.)      Read more: Be on the Lookout for These 4 Bitcoin Bear Signals      Besides price, realized volatility is another metric worth considering from a cyclical viewpoint. In the chart below, we divided bitcoin's 30-day volatility of daily log returns into three categories: low volatility (< 0.5), middle (≥ 0.5 and < 1.0) and high (≥ 1.0). A cycle is defined as a period during which the 30-day moving average of the 30-day volatility does not move from one category to another.      The chart above shows the average length of a volatility cycle by year. (The year in which a cycle falls is determined by its end date.) After mostly getting longer from 2014 to 2018, these cycles became a lot shorter in 2019 and have stayed relatively short. The current volatility cycle was at 45 days, when this chart was made on Tuesday. It hasn't changed since then.      Bitcoin has been trading in or near a band between $50,000 and $60,000 since mid-February. In these COVID-stretched days, it feels like a long time. But the current volatility regime is still below recent averages.

42406310,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetSlg,1619806895,Iran's Bitcoin Bet and the Money Wars to Come,"During a continued divergence in the crypto markets, where ether posted new all-time highs while bitcoin wallowed at levels almost $10,000 below its peak, the politics and buzz around both continue to spur thought and debate.      In the spirit of that, this week’s newsletter dives into Iran’s ostensibly pro-bitcoin strategy and shows how it contravenes the level playing field values on which bitcoin is built. It also looks at the explosion in non-fungible token (NFT) sales and offers a lesson from Crypto Twitter on how to deal with rumors.      After you’ve read all that, please find time to listen to this week’s excellent episode of our “Money Reimagined” podcast.      In the latest stop on our world tour of crypto hot spots, Sheila Warren and I talk to two Nigerian entrepreneurs: Yele Bademosi, the CEO of payments app Bundle Africa, and Adia Sowho, a venture builder and operator. Among this entertaining pair’s many cool insights was the idea the Nigerian Central Bank’s February order that banks shut down crypto companies’ access backfired. It spurred even more innovation, inspiring local developers to dream up new decentralized solutions for getting around the banking sector’s gatekeepers.    Iran is the Cuba of the crypto age    Be careful what you wish for.      News this week that Iran will allow a small set of qualified entities to pay for imports with cryptocurrency mined by licensed operators might sound like an enlightened move to some bitcoin enthusiasts.      It fits a narrative that when governments start accepting bitcoin, they jump-start its role as a universal reserve asset. Meanwhile, the free trade-minded who chafe at all government intervention in markets may view Iran’s use of bitcoin to get around U.S. sanctions as a positive blow for global commerce generally.    You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    But look closer and you’ll see in Iran’s bitcoin strategy the hallmarks of an authoritarian system that flouts the freedoms crypto advocates like to embrace. When viewed alongside a crackdown against unlicensed crypto mining, the regime’s moves could widen the divide between government-favored elites and average Iranians. (Below we delve into the lessons on this taken from Cuba’s destructive dual-currency system.)      It’s not clear if federal officials in Washington will care about that inequity. But it will view Iran’s bitcoin solution for sanction avoidance with alarm, as it undermines the United States’ self-appointed role as cop to the global financial system. Concerns about that will be amplified if it’s apparent that China, which is eager to knock the dollar off its international reserve currency perch, is directly or indirectly supporting Iran’s approach. (The pathways for Beijing to do so are already laid.)      The question is: How should the Biden administration respond? Let’s hope it avoids the temptation to roll this into a simplistic “bitcoin bad” narrative and imposes tighter controls on the cryptocurrency’s users in the U.S. and elsewhere. A more constructive approach would encourage Iran to abandon its strategy for a crypto policy that favors innovation, green infrastructure and economic freedom for all its citizens.    Some miners more equal than others    The intent of the government of President Hassan Rouhani is hardly a mystery.      Even though Iran is a major oil producer, years of crippling U.S. sanctions aimed at containing its nuclear weapons program have deprived its economy of dollars. That makes it very difficult for Iran to buy what it needs from the world, and ensures that the local currency, the rial, is under perpetual downward pressure, which in turn stokes inflation.      Now, by creating a legal framework in which bitcoin can be mined locally, taxed under a strict licensing system and used by regulated institutions to pay for imports, the government has a workaround. Iran will still struggle to sell its energy resources for dollars, but it can do the next best thing: It can convert that same local resource into bitcoin, a harder currency than dollars.      At the same time, the regime is showing its authoritarian instincts. In January, it said that Iran had 24 officially registered mining farms, consuming 310 megawatts of power, and that the Ministry of Energy had shut down 1,620 illegal bitcoin mining operations with a capacity of 250 megawatts over the prior 18 months. It offered rewards of up to 100 million rials ($2,350) for information leading to the arrest of illegal miners.      In a subsequent story by CoinDesk’s Anna Baydakova, one household miner, “Basir” (not his real name), said he spent a week in jail before he could scrounge up the large bail amount by selling his house, his car and his mining equipment.      The premise for the crackdown is that illegal mining is disrupting Iran’s overstretched electricity grid. But bitcoin advocates say that is unfair as the country’s blackouts have continued even after the authorities have done their sweep.      Regardless, by making itself the gatekeeper for domestically mined bitcoin and discriminating over which entities can access it, the government is laying the groundwork for societal divisions – especially if bitcoin grows in importance, as many expect it will.      To understand why, let’s go back to the early years of the post-Cold War era in Cuba, another country that has labored under the constraints of U.S. sanctions.    Cuba's lesson    In 1993, Fidel Castro’s regime was broke. Its longtime benefactor, the Soviet Union, had collapsed and the island economy was reeling from four years of “Special Period” austerity.      Castro reluctantly adopted a radical solution: He legalized the use of U.S. dollars, but only within designated, closely regulated industries such as government-sanctioned tourism resorts that could only accept foreigners as guests. It later entrenched this system by requiring all incoming foreign currency, including that carried by foreign tourists, be exchanged into “convertible pesos,” a new local currency pegged one-to-one with the dollar. The new notes would circulate in parallel with the traditional Cuban peso, known as “moneda nacional” (national currency), but could only be used in those same sanctioned settings.      The strategy gave the regime a lifeline. With taxes from regulated foreign currency inflows, it continued to defy the Helms-Burton Act.      But the system created two Cubas, one where a privileged elite got access to goods and services available only in de facto foreign currency. Everyone else earned near-worthless moneda nacional, which could buy only items listed on the “libreta,” or ration book, an artifact of Soviet communism that guaranteed necessities such as bread and milk but excluded anything deemed to be a “luxury” – in effect, anything imported. To give you an idea of how limiting the libreta was, it did not include the “luxury” of tampons.      These deep divisions also bred rampant corruption because goods designated for the moneda nacional economy were hoarded and sold illegally in the convertible peso economy.      Bakers would secretly deliver half their production to fancy foreign tourist-only restaurants, denying libreta holders their bread rations. Gas stations would siphon off gasoline intended for domestic customers and deliver it to companies operating in the convertible peso economy. Painters would thin out their paint so that they could sell half their supplies to hotels.      The human effect of this stood out to me when I visited Cuba for book research in 2008. One day, I hired a rickshaw driver with my convertible pesos. Every time he saw a policeman up ahead, he urged me to dismount and walk to meet him two blocks down the road because he couldn’t be seen to be servicing dollar-wielding foreign tourists.      The system created a new class of predominantly white elites whose expat families in Miami and Madrid would send them foreign currency, while doing nothing for a disproportionately black community without such ties.      By the standards of Communist Cuba’s professed egalitarian ideals, it was an abomination. Yet, it took the government 28 years – until January of this year – to unify the currencies. Such was the intoxicating appeal of this unjust system for the Castro dictatorship – first under Fidel, then under his brother, Raul.    A different path?    Similar inequity lies ahead for Iran if it sticks with its crypto strategy and, as many of us believe, bitcoin becomes a sought-after store of value in a post-COVID era of high debt, slow growth and fiat currency depreciation. Some Iranians will become phenomenally rich. Others will be stuck with worthless rials. Attempts to cross the divide will encourage corruption and social tensions.      Still, for the Iranian regime, the strategy is a tempting way to fund itself. Also, given Iran’s relationship with China – with which it recently struck a $400 billion, 25-year investment deal that included access to Iranian oil and a plan for a binational “bank” – it presents an opportunity to shift the geopolitical landscape.      China has the largest bitcoin mining industry in the world, and so it’s not hard to imagine Chinese bitcoin miners building officially endorsed, fossil fuel-run facilities inside Iran. Once bilateral payment agreements are in place to use digital currencies that bypass the U.S.-led global financial system, one can foresee a feedback loop in which China gets oil, Iran gets hard currency, the dollar’s power is diminished, and bitcoin’s carbon footprint grows.      How should the U.S. respond?      My fear is the rallying cry in Congress will be that bitcoin is “enabling” reprehensible sanctions-busting behavior, prompting calls for tougher crypto regulations. That will only drive more activity underground and encourage more dirty fuel installations in Iran and elsewhere – in effect, strengthening the regime’s hand.      The alternative is the U.S. government takes a more constructive approach, encouraging innovation and economic freedom. It could offer to work with domestic bitcoin miners to commit to zero greenhouse emissions and, in so doing, develop such energy sources, whether it’s the government’s nuclear plants or locally run solar and wind operations.      As I wrote in a prior newsletter, I see a pathway for government incentives to make bitcoin mining a catalyst for green energy development. Iran, as an energy powerhouse, is well placed to work with U.S. scientists on such solutions.      One can hope, right?    Off the charts: The growing NFT pie    With “Saturday Night Live” making skits about NFTs, multiple sports stars and celebrities minting them and digital art selling for nosebleed prices, it seems like a good time to check in on how the NFT market has responded to all this attention.      Thankfully, the latest quarterly report from ConsenSys on the state of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem on Ethereum contains a nice set of pie charts to tell the story:      As expected, sales of crypto art grew rapidly during the quarter as a mania for non-fungible tokens took hold. However, the spoils of the growing pie were not distributed evenly. Nifty Gateway, the NFT platform acquired by Gemini two years ago, has consistently gobbled up the biggest piece of it.      Why? In one word: Beeple. The March $69 million sale of the digital artist’s ""Everydays – The First Five Thousand Days"" digital collage was not only a major driver of the platform’s volume, it also reflected the established relationship Beeple had already built with Christie’s, Nifty Gateway and other sellers of high-value digital art.    The conversation: The rumor Milne    Herein lies an old-school journalist’s crotchety warnings about treating rumors responsibly.      Crypto Twitter can take some lessons from a saga that began with a tweet early Tuesday by Alistair Milne, whose Twitter profile (89,300 followers) says he is the CIO of the Altana Digital Currency Fund.      That got many, many, people excited – for obvious reasons. Bitcoin’s price did not immediately jump after the tweet, but for the 36-hour period (until the rumor turned out to be false), it brushed with its highest level for the week. Knowing the trigger-happiness of the crypto investor scene, it seems likely that Milne’s tweet, which was very widely shared, prompted many to buy.      Now, before we discuss what Facebook actually announced, here’s a basic rule to which I was rightly subjected in financial newsrooms throughout my career: We could never report on potentially market-moving rumors, however interesting they might be, for the simple reason that you could cause people to unfairly lose or gain money on unsubstantiated hearsay.      Rumors are prevalent in all markets, precisely because people have vested interests in the price impact they can have. The last thing you want to do as a respected news outlet with a large megaphone is to amplify the rumormonger’s message. A rumor is a prompt for a journalist to try to confirm the truth of it, not to report on it prematurely.      Of course, Milne is not a journalist. But in the age of social media, and for the purposes of this discussion, it’s a distinction without a difference. He has 89,000 followers and a reputation as an early investor in the space. We all have a responsibility to our audience.      Anyway...       Facebook’s earnings came and went on Wednesday evening with nary a mention of “bitcoin,” “cryptocurrency,” “blockchain,” “dogecoin,” or even “libra” or, for that matter, “diem.”      Some delighted in the non-eventness of it all:      But others were incensed. This Twitter user summed up Crypto Twitter’s reaction quite nicely (sound on):      As Milne came under attack, he stood his ground. He didn’t delete the tweet and found some lighthearted ways to laugh it off, asking whether he should delete his account and then declaring he would never tweet again until Facebook does buy bitcoin.      But his mentions kept filling up. It probably didn’t help he had tweet-boasted 14 hours before the Facebook earnings release of taking profits, nor that he later defensively blamed the rumor on someone else.      Here, two old-school newsroom rules are useful: 1) the problem is not that you start a rumor per se, it’s that you amplify it and in so doing legitimize it, and 2) just putting the label “rumor” on an unsubstantiated claim does not get you off the hook. You’re still amplifying it.      That last tweet, 22 hours after the Facebook earnings report, suggests our culprit still has some learning to do.      Still, it’s heartening to know that an angry Twitter mob can have a sobering impact. Based on this last tweet from Alistair Milne on the topic Thursday night, he might think twice next time:    Relevant reads: When ETF?    Bitcoin investors are hoping the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission finally approves an exchange-traded fund for bitcoin, giving the price a boost. With at least three proposals before an SEC that’s now led by crypto-savvy Chairman Gary Gensler, and given the success of three Canadian ETFs, expectations are stronger than ever for a positive ruling.    So, it was a little disappointing for many that, as Nikhilesh De reported, the SEC has delayed a decision until June at the earliest on a proposal that comes with the most establishment name recognition, that of mutual fund manager VanEck.  After all, as Daniel Kuhn argued when he took issue with a Financial Times’ reporter’s characterization of bitcoin as “immature,” these eight-year-old arguments about crypto markets being too underdeveloped for an ETF seem outdated at a time when total market capitalization stands at more than $2 trillion.  But, hey, maybe the U.S. doesn’t matter. As Jamie Crawley reported, Wisdom Tree, one of the bitcoin ETF hopefuls now before the SEC, went off and easily listed a new ETP (exchange-traded product, a concept quite close to an ETF) in Germany and Switzerland this week – not for bitcoin, but for ether.  Indeed, the Wisdom Tree listing looks like good timing. Based on another report from Jamie Crawley, proposed legislation in Germany that would allow wealth and institutional investment fund managers known as Spezialfonds (special funds) to invest up to 20% of their portfolio in cryptocurrencies could bring as much as $425 billion into the market.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Michael J.

42406301,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetScp,1619805748,Cardano in Africa: Inside IOHK's Ethiopia Blockchain Deal,"Ethiopia might be not the first place you think of as a hotspot for blockchain technology.      A predominantly rural country where only 15% of the population has access to the internet, Ethiopia is going through severe civil unrest in the north. Ethnic strife in the Tigray region recently led to thousands killed and millions fleeing the country as refugees to neighboring Sudan. The country is also experiencing local internet shutdowns.      Ethiopia is thus a good example of the gap between the ambitious goals of modern technology and the actual circumstances on the ground.      IOHK, the company behind the cardano (ADA) cryptocurrency, believes it can help bridge this gap. This week, IOHK announced it has partnered with the Ethiopian government to create a blockchain-based system to track student performance in local schools.      “It’s a hard country, so if we make it there we can make it anywhere,” said John O’Connor, IOHK’s director of African Operations.    ‘A dream come true’    Local challenges do not appear to be deterring IOHK from its mission. “Life has to go on for the rest of the country,” said O’Connor.      IOHK is establishing a physical presence in the country, opening an office in the capital, Addis Ababa, and starting work on the large-scale blockchain ID project, which is expected to go live in January 2022, O’Connor told CoinDesk. At the moment, the core identity product, named PRISM, is ready, and other features, including classroom management, will come later.      In a video stream IOHK made on April 29, Ethiopia’s Minister of Education, Getahun Mekuria, spoke of the partnership, saying the “initiative is about bringing technology to improve the quality of education” in Ethiopia. Cardano is one of the top cryptocurrencies, the minister said, which is why “doing blockchain with IOHK is like a dream coming true” for him.      According to the minister, 5 million students will receive Cardano blockchain-based IDs, which will allow the authorities to track every student’s academic performance. Also, 750,000 teachers will get access to the system. According to the minister, the Ethiopian government struck a deal with an undisclosed Chinese manufacturer to provide enough tablets for the project to happen.      O’Connor said the ministry, which enjoys financial support from large donors in the West including USAID, will fund the purchase of the tablets, and also build lacking infrastructure so that 3,500 Ethiopian schools have access to the internet and can use the new system.      CoinDesk asked Ethiopia’s Ministry of Education to confirm these infrastructure plans but received no response by press time. It’s not clear how much the project will cost the government.    On the ground    O’Connor is half-Ethiopian and said he spent a few years in the country, hanging out with tech specialists. He was able to build a good rapport with Getahun Mekuria, who was the minister of science and technology before becoming the minister of education, O’Connor added.      IOHK also got involved with Ethiopia’s local tech community. In 2019, the company organized training for female developers, teaching them to code in Haskel, Cardano’s programming language. After that, the IOHK Addis Ababa office hired seven of the 30 alums, O’Connor said.      He believes that with Ethiopia’s predominantly young population and the government’s enthusiasm about blockchain, major progress can be achieved no matter how tough the task may appear. At the moment, most information in Ethiopia is recorded on paper, not electronically, so the Ministry of Education has no actual data of the situation on the ground, O’Connor explained.      Now, IOHK wants to take this obsolete system and launch it into the Web 3.0 era. If the project succeeds, the results will be much more notable than they would be in many other places in the world, O’Connor believes.      “The marginal improvement in the U.K. wouldn’t be as great as in Ethiopia,” he said.    How it will work    The system IOHK is building will mostly rely on the Ministry of Education running a full node, and schools will use a light client to get access. However, the system will be operating on the public Cardano blockchain and so will be decentralized in this sense, he said.      To implement the project in thousands of schools across Ethiopia (though not in the Tigray region, where civil unrest continues), IOHK will work with a wide network of partners, O’Connor said, including mobile payment networks.      As a result, high school graduates will receive cards with near field communication (NFC) chips that will contain their educational credentials. This means the data will be available even if a child doesn’t have a mobile phone or other device to connect to the system, O’Connor said.      This will resolve the issue of fake certifications, which is a serious problem in Ethiopia, he said. This might give young Ethiopians opportunities they don’t have now because their diplomas are not viewed as being reliable in the West, O’Connor said.      “I studied at Oxford and I was intrigued why there were no students from Ethiopia. When I asked about it I was told [the college] didn’t recognize their credentials. They don’t have enough information about what’s happening in Ethiopian universities,” O’Connor said.      When the project goes live, it will start with 12th grade students, Minister Getahun Mekuria said in the video stream with Cardano. But in the following years more students will receive blockchain IDs. According to O’Connor, the first million tablet computers for students are due to arrive in Ethiopia this month.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/30/cardano-in-africa-inside-iohks-ethiopia-blockchain-deal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/498e27d6ae378d01b66a2c03ab81916a90126a3f-1200x802.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406287,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetP1U,1619804562,"Colombia’s Crypto Use Soars, and Local Regulators Step In","More and more Colombians are using crypto, and that has regulators stepping in with rules.      According to Jehudi Castro, digital transformation adviser to the Presidency of Colombia, the government simply could not ignore the upswing in crypto use in Colombia – along with various scams.      “The consequence of all this crypto activity is that we have to be careful. We can’t stand by and do nothing,” Castro told CoinDesk.      The trajectory is clear. Last year, Chilean crypto exchange Buda.com recorded $31.1 million in traded volume in Colombia. In the first three months of this year alone the exchange recorded close to $40 million traded on the platform.      “It’s our best year ever. In just three months we passed our 2020 threshold. It’s crazy,” Alejandro Beltrán, Colombia country manager for Buda.com, told CoinDesk.    Alejandro Beltrán Torrado will be speaking at Consensus by CoinDesk, our virtual experience May 24-27. Register here.    Colombia is emerging as one of the fastest-growing crypto markets in the region, second only to Venezuela, according to Chainalysis’ 2020 global crypto adoption index. Colombia ranked ninth in the index, only three places behind the U.S. The same year, peer-to-peer crypto trading platform LocalBitcoins found Colombia to be its third-largest market globally by trading volume.      The government appears to be taking note. In addition to expanding its fintech regulatory testing environment, or sandbox, to include cryptocurrency startups in 2020, regulators have issued crypto tax guidelines as well as anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. They are now conducting a pilot that allows top local commercial banks to work with notable international crypto exchanges to test certain services.      But none of the recent regulatory measures appears to be overly restrictive. Banning crypto would be pointless, said Castro, who is a member of the evaluating committee for the sandbox.      “The correct thing to do is gather data and implement regulations incrementally as required. The position of the Colombian government regarding crypto regulations is that they shouldn’t be made without data and without sufficient information,” Castro said.    The banking pilot    In January, Colombia’s financial watchdog, the SFC, announced that nine crypto firms (out of 14 applicants) were chosen to test banking services for crypto platforms in a yearlong project that started in March. According to the announcement, the goal of the pilot is to allow Colombia’s fintech firms and the national government to safely test crypto use cases under the regulatory sandbox.      The country’s biggest banks have worked with international crypto exchanges operating in Colombia, and Buda.com was one of the selected firms. Bancolombia partnered with Gemini, while Davivienda bank partnered with Binance. Latin American exchanges Buda and Bitso are working with Banco de Bogotá.      According to Beltrán, the banks will be working with crypto platforms to test on/off ramps for deposits and withdrawals.      “But the banks don't touch any cryptocurrencies. They don't have a direct relationship with cryptocurrencies,” Beltrán said.      The pilot project has no impact on the current regulatory framework applicable to crypto assets, the SFC said in the announcement. Castro explained that as part of the sandbox the chosen crypto firms are allowed to test their own projects under their own rules, and so the government can gather data for implementing regulations.      “But those crypto firms have to work together with the government and regulated banking institutions,” Castro said, referring to the sandbox.      Buda.com’s own pilot test will allow its users (who already have bank accounts with Banco de Bogotá) to make deposits on the platform through their bank accounts. Bank customers who are interested in the pilot project or cryptocurrencies can register on Buda.com to start using cryptocurrencies.      Beltrán added that Buda.com is validating some details with the bank, and he hopes to begin operations in May or June.    AML guidelines    In December, Colombia’s Superintendency of Corporations published a circular that included AML guidelines for financial institutions in accordance with the rules specified by the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog, the FATF.      Castro said that because banks are regulated, the partnerships between crypto firms and those involved in the sandbox presents a much easier and legal way to implement AML requirements.      “The exchange must implement risk management of money laundering and terrorist financing, operational risk and cybersecurity, and consumer protection measures during the test,"" Castro said. “The sandbox is allowing Colombians to carry out operations with crypto firms within high security standards and adequate risk management, in a similar way to what is currently done with e-commerce.”      Beltrán said the local crypto industry had been ready for AML regulations for five years.      “Before this we had a voluntary system, but now we are obligated to integrate it by the rules of Colombia,” Beltrán said.    Government can’t ignore crypto    It wasn’t always smooth sailing for Buda.com. In 2018, a lack of regulatory clarity about crypto in Colombia led to a number of local banks shutting down accounts held by the exchange.      “The government tried for years to deny the existence of crypto but right now, because cryptocurrency is a global phenomenon, they can't deny what's happening and they are trying to to change their minds,” Beltrán said. He added that when the Buda.com accounts were shut down, the financial authorities did not speak to him about getting the accounts back online.      According to Castro, the goal of the sandbox is to pave the way for a legal framework that doesn’t stop innovation in the crypto or decentralized finance (DeFi) space.      Castro also said the Colombian government is not only carefully stepping into the crypto market but is looking at ways to use blockchain to fight corruption. Last year, the government began working with the World Economic Forum (WEF) on a blockchain-based solution to tracking government contracts in a transparent way.      “We've been through many things, bad and good. Right now we are on the good side,” Beltrán said.",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/04/30/colombias-crypto-use-soars-and-local-regulators-step-in,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e783f76d9e273d41ade9f71ed194a6d801e83ba2-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406280,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetOub,1619800755,Financial Censorship Is a Thing. Bitcoin Fixes It,"The next time someone smugly tells you there is “no legitimate use case” for cryptocurrency, or asserts that it has “no redeeming social value,” shove this story in his or her face:      Meduza, a Russian news outlet, is soliciting donations in cryptocurrency (along with traditional payment methods) after the government labeled it a “foreign agent,” CoinDesk’s on-the-ground correspondent, Anna Baydakova, reported Thursday.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories on cryptocurrency and the future of money. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Meduza is now required by law to post a notice of its “foreign agent” status in a typeface bigger than the text of its articles. As a result of this scarlet letter, Meduza lost many of its advertisers and is running out of money, the team behind the publication said. Apparently, it hasn’t been deplatformed by traditional financial institutions because it is also taking donations by bank card and PayPal. But the reasons Meduza gave for including the crypto option were telling.      “If people are afraid to send us money from their bank accounts, and they might well be, they can send us crypto,” said Meduza’s editor-in-chief, Ivan Kolpakov.      A skeptic might note that donors who send bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), or BNB to Meduza would leave a permanent record of their actions on the blockchains, or public ledgers, of these assets. But such a record would show only the address, a random-seeming string of numbers and letters, that sent the money, not the person behind it. An address may or may not be tied to donors’ real-world identity, depending on how they acquired the crypto and what steps they took to protect their privacy, whereas their bank and PayPal accounts definitely are.    The age of weaponized banking    Further, if recent history teaches us anything, it is that financial intermediaries cannot be relied upon to stand with dissident or unpopular voices.      We saw this more than a decade ago with the blockade of WikiLeaks by PayPal and other large financial institutions that caved to extra-legal pressure from U.S. politicians.      We see it today when payment processors and crowdfunding sites boot content creators, fundraisers or pariah-friendly internet platforms, not because they are breaking any laws but because their speech offends activists. I, too, find the content in many of these cases unsavory. But I don’t mind that it exists, and I don’t want to prevent those who want to read, watch or hear it from doing so. That’s a basic “small-l liberal” principle. Or was.      To quote a locked Twitter account, whom I will not name out of respect for the person's privacy: “If I cover my ears because I don’t want to hear from you, it’s not censorship. If I cover your mouth or someone else’s ears because people want to hear you, it’s censorship.”      I can already hear the bien pensants say, “It’s only censorship when the government does it.” But even if you accept only that narrow legal definition of the word, it surely describes what the Russian government – the very regime whose influence in the U.S. many of those same bien pensants spent the last four years hyperventilating about – is trying to do to Meduza.      Crypto might thwart that attempt, or at least hinder it, by enabling individuals to transfer money to a publisher without permission from third parties that can be strong-armed or politicized.    Downsides    By all means, let’s talk about the copious amounts of electricity required to secure Bitcoin and other proof-of-stake networks – although describing this intensive computation as “wasteful” is a subjective value judgment. (TikTok and hair dryers are wasteful in my book. Should those things be banned?)      By all means, let’s acknowledge that cryptocurrency’s openness to all comers makes it attractive to criminals – although the blockchain’s trail of crumbs also helps law enforcement catch the crooks who use these systems.      See also: Daniel Kuhn – Bitcoin, Warts and All      By all means, let’s pay attention to how terrorists, foreign or now, we’re told, domestic, might take advantage of this technology. But if we’re going to blame anyone or anything other than the terrorists for their actions, remember it was not Satoshi Nakamoto who destabilized the Middle East or hollowed out Middle America.      When tallying the social costs of censorship-resistant money, do not ignore the benefits for the Meduzas of the world.",POSITIVE,BTC | BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | BNB,Marc Hochstein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/30/financial-censorship-is-a-thing-bitcoin-fixes-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/70b6e9367d74ed67f3b2987557fd15b8c9a8680a-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406290,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetP4R,1619800056,Bitcoin Jumps 6% to $57K as Market Shrugs Off $4B+ Options Expiry,"Bitcoin (BTC) prices surged Friday as the market appeared largely unfazed by the expiration of more than $4 billion of options earlier in the day. Historical price patterns suggest the largest cryptocurrency may be due for further gains over the coming weeks.      Since October the settlement of the monthly options contracts has proven to be a catalyst for bullish short-term moves. In the 10 days following the past six monthly expiries, the cryptocurrency has charted gains ranging from 7% to 35%.      Last month, prices pulled back to $50,000 in the week leading up to the March 26 expiry, only to reverse course in the following days and reach new record highs above $64,000 on April 14. A similar dynamic unfolded before and after the February and January expiries.      One possible explanation for the month-end pullbacks was that the ""max pain point"" – the strike price at which the most open options contracts expire worthless – was so far below the spot price. Such a setup raises the risk that some traders might try to push the market down so that the options would be in the money at expiration.      For instance, the max pain point for the March 26 expiry was $44,000, and the cryptocurrency traded near $60,000 a week before expiry. That likely prompted options sellers – typically institutions – to create bearish pressure in the spot/futures market and push prices closer to the max pain point in a bid to inflict maximum loss on options buyers.      This time around, the max pain point for the April expiry, which took place at 08:00 UTC Friday, was $54,000, according to Deribit, the dominant exchange for trading cryptocurrency options.      Prices fell from $60,000 to $48,000 in the eight days to April 25. However, the cryptocurrency bounced back over the next few days. By the time of Friday's expiration, the price was right around the max pain point of $54,000. Most options expired worthless or out of the money.      Also read: Bitcoin Stabilizes Near Support; Resistance Around $56K-$58K      The exchange settled some 77,000 options contracts worth over $4 billion, data shows.

During the last market cycle, ethereum broke this level and [had] as high as 80% of bitcoin’s value.”  “The crypto narrative is shifting from bitcoin to ethereum and other segments like DeFi (decentralized finance) and Web 3.0 apps.”  FundStrat is bullish on ETH as new financial applications are being developed on the Ethereum network, which has grown significantly in scale over the last year.  “These applications are generating ~3x fees for the Ethereum network vs. Bitcoin, which trades at ~3x the market cap.”  “In crypto accounting terms, this is the same as a company using revenue, less operating costs and earning profit that is used to buy back stock. This means the network would become profitable like a company once ETH supply reduction from burned fees outpaces inflation,” wrote FundStrat.

A spokeswoman for the prosecutor’s office said CEO Faruk Fatih Ozer’s brother and sister and other senior employees were among the six jailed, according to a report by Reuters.  The police detained at least 83 people in connection with the investigation over the last week, most of whom have since been released.  Interpol issued a red notice on April 23 for Ozer, who fled to Albania shortly after Thodex ceased trading. An Interpol red notice is a request to law enforcement officials worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition.  The exchange, which has 400,000 members, announced it was undergoing maintenance April 18-19, subsequently telling users it would be offline for five days.  Users filed a complaint against the exchange April 22 alleging hundreds of million of dollars had been stolen.  Suleyman Soylu, Turkey’s Minister of the Interior, said the company’s portfolio totaled $108 million.  Turkey has been tightening restrictions on the cryptocurrency industry of late, banning crypto as a means of payment effective today.  Prior to the ban, crypto use was soaring thanks in part to the Turkish lira facing significant outside selling pressure.  Another crypto exchange, Vebitcoin, has also found itself in the firing line of these legal and regulatory pressures. Vebitcoin informed users April 24 it was stopping all activity due to financial strain, state-run Anadolu news agency said.  Turkish authorities froze all bank accounts associated with Vebitcoin.

O'Connor told CoinDesk the company is only beginning to develop the code for this project, and does not expect to launch anything before January 2022.

42406284,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetOwZ,1619790648,China Is Opting Out of US-Run Financial System,"An ancient Chinese proverb states that “the man who moves a mountain begins by carrying away small stones.” China has perfected that like no other nation and has been working to create the infrastructure to leapfrog to global reserve currency status by innovating, building and controlling the plumbing of a competing global financial system. Digital currencies are a key part of this Great Game.      The U.S., with Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler in the lead, has taken notice and is finally beginning to stir. Gensler once told NPR: “Markets work best when there’s a cop on the beat."" His observation speaks to the competition among international central banks. But it's the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) that may ultimately become the one, and only, unofficial, cop monitoring and influencing global financial flows.    Sune Sorensen is Co-Managing Director of The Strategic Funds.    The current global financial system is managed by Wall Street and the Washington Consensus. China wants to have more control over its destiny by using other currencies in a cross-border digital world.      Wang Xin, director of the PBOC’s research division, stated, “If the digital currency is closely associated with the U.S. dollar, it could create a scenario under which sovereign currencies would coexist with U.S. dollar-centric digital currencies. But there would be in essence one boss, that is the U.S. dollar and the United States. If so, it would bring a series of economic, financial and even international political consequences.”      China’s recent announcement to join the central bank digital currency (mCBDC) bridge project demonstrates its willingness to design a world without the U.S. dollar supporting it.      While China eclipses the United States in the space race for digital currencies, could that be a Betamax-versus-VHS scenario of incompatible financial systems? The world may depend on the U.S. dollar presently, but the world may switch to another currency under China’s influence. If the U.S. government doesn’t lead private-public partnerships encouraging financial innovation, then China will leapfrog it and control the world’s financial infrastructure.    Read more: Omer Ozden: What China’s Blockchain Services Network Means for the World    Despite unresolved banking system issues, the Chinese have applied former European Central Bank President and current Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi's dictum to do “whatever it takes"" to their administration of national and, potentially, international financial affairs. The Chinese know that the financial fishbowl built by the West decades ago lacks the legacy control over the future flow of the world’s money.      An old Chinese proverb says, “If you want to know what water is, don't ask the fish.” If members of the dollar-denominated financial world are the fish, then fresh perspectives are needed to unseat the PBOC's advantageous position in global markets.      For decades, China has worked on alternatives to the Western-dominated SWIFT system and has sought to obtain a more powerful position within global financial governance institutions such as the International Monetary Fund. Recently, it has given its fintech industry massive support, effectively putting it in a commanding emerging-markets position. Access to payments grants the Chinese government unprecedented access to its citizens’ buying decisions and taxable wealth. China’s aggressive push into CBDCs is the next step in the process of establishing a credible alternative to the euro in the East and dominance of regional finances.      In short, China has taken a number of actions to put it position at the forefront of the global fintech revolution – actions that require a coordinated and consistent response if China is to be prevented from influencing the global financial infrastructure in a direct manner.    China testing digital currency    Wang Xin, also said, “The PBOC sees itself in a race with the United States on digital currency.” He added, “We had an early start…but lots of work is needed to consolidate our lead.”      The intent of the People’s Bank of China’s central bank digital currency – often referred to as the digital yuan – is to offer an alternative to cash. A leader in cashless payments, China is testing the digital yuan in real-world trials in Shenzhen, Chengdu, Suzhou and other cities, while experimenting with the idea of expanding use to international athletes and visitors at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.    Read more: Inside China’s Effort to Create a Blockchain It Can Control    While China systematically goes about its business of implementing a fait accompli in developing the next global financial system, many world governments and regulators are missing the forest for the trees. These governments tend to see the broader digital currency and asset market as a silly plaything of millennials or are overreacting and focused on slamming the barn door shut long after the horse has bolted.      The Chinese government, on the other hand, has always encouraged monetary innovation with the goal of improving daily transactions for its citizens and monitoring the national economy.    China's alternative to SWIFT    Cryptoassets with international use cases have garnered attention, but the general manager of the China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation pointed out, “A unified payment platform is easier to achieve than a unified global digital currency, which will find it harder to get a foothold.”      According to a report from the Bank of China, the potential exists for the United States to cut off access to Chinese banks’ dollar settlements. That could lead to China halting U.S. dollar use as the anchor currency for its foreign exchange controls.      Meanwhile, use of the the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) will increase if international transactions of China’s national digital currency bypasses SWIFT. The development will in turn make it easier to avoid U.S. financial sanctions, while reducing exposure of China’s global payments data to the U.S.      China wants to manage its national debt effectively as well as monopolize international industries and resources in the brave new world without U.S.-imposed restrictions. The late economist John Maynard Keynes once wrote, “Though in the ideal commonwealth, men may have been taught or inspired or bred to take no interest in the stakes, it may still be wise and prudent statesmanship to allow the game to be played, subject to rules and limitations.” The Chinese know that writing new rules influences establishment of a new world order.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Sune Sorensen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/04/30/china-is-opting-out-of-us-run-financial-system,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4bdcb4ceb891acfb9b2db129abe0b221ca3131c2-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

(ICE), owner of the New York Stock Exchange, sold its 1.4% stake in newly listed Coinbase earlier this month for $1.2 billion.      Minus tax, the sale of shares in the leading cryptocurrency exchange generated $900 million, ICE Chief Financial Officer Scott Hill said on a first-quarter earnings call Friday. The proceeds were used to pay down debt.

Some early backers collected a lot of money from the direct listing of Coinbase on Nasdaq, which incidentally valued the San Francisco-based crypto exchange higher than ICE.

Meanwhile, ICE-owned cryptocurrency exchange Bakkt is close to going public, too, around the end of this quarter via a blank check company, which Hill alluded to on the call.      “We expect that Bakkt's merger with Victory Park Spac will be completed toward the end of this quarter.

According to a press release shared with CoinDesk on Friday, Medici has signed a seven-year contract with the Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources of the Republic of Zambia.      The project will see the initial issuance of 4 million Certificates of Titles (COTs) over the life of the contract with a further 3.5 million COTs issued during the following three years.      The initiative is part of the country's National Land Titling Program, which is expected to be the largest project of its kind in Zambia, according to the release.      See also: Overstock Subsidiary to Put Wyoming County Land Registry on the Blockchain      The ministry, along with Medici, ran a pilot project in 2018 to collect 50,000 title-eligible properties using proprietary systematic land titling technology known as Enum in the country's capital of Lusaka City.      MLG uses blockchain technology to support land governance, titling and administration with a public record of land ownership. In Zambia, it will employ Enum to gather landowner information for processing and issuing title deeds.      Enum provides tools that can be used by trained and locally hired enumerators with mobile tablets who knock door-to-door to collect the data.      The data collected includes items such as names, identification, co-ownership, administrators, sex, age and picture of owners as well as high-resolution aerial imagery and complete maps with boundaries, according to MLG's webpage. Upon completion, the data will be uploaded into a government approval system built by MLG.      MLG will also provide a means of integrating a payment platform with Enum that will be used to collect titling fees from landowners on behalf of the ministry and in collaboration with the Smart Zambia Institute – a division under the Office of the President.      ""This program has the overall objective of ensuring security of tenure for our people,"" Jean Kapata, Minister of Lands and Resources, said in the release.

42406291,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetP5Q,1619780378,Scaling Narrative Propels Polygon's MATIC Token Closer to $1,"Polygon Network's MATIC token continues to rally in a sign of persistent demand for layer 2 scaling projects that help decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols bypass Ethereum's high transaction costs and thus attract more users.      MATIC reached a record high of $0.9459 early today, surpassing the previous high of $0.92 reached on Thursday, according to data provided by CryptoCompare. Messari puts the cryptocurrency's daily high at $1.05.      The token has rallied by 150% this month, outperforming ether's 45% rise.      ""The ongoing capital rotation into all things Polygon is showing no signs of abating,"" Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Synergia Capital, said. ""The layer 2 scaling solution is attracting capital inflows at an astronomical rate, as evidenced by the recent sharp rise in the total value locked through $1.5 billion.""      Scaling refers to increasing the throughput of the system, as measured by transactions per second.      Layer 2 scaling solutions facilitate faster and cheaper transactions by running sidechains or tangential networks alongside the main Ethereum blockchain. Demand for these projects has picked up in the wake of network congestion and high transaction costs on Ethereum's blockchain., with prominent DeFi protocols like Aave announcing integration with Polygon earlier this month.      Derivatives market data shows the focus has shifted to Ethereum-based scaling solutions in recent weeks from rival blockchains like Solana.      Open interest in MATIC futures listed on Binance, FTX and Huobi has skyrocketed along with the cryptocurrency's price. Open interest refers to the number of contracts traded but not squared off with an offsetting position.      Open interest in Solana's SOL token has turned south since mid-April, after it had risen solidly during the preceding months. Vinokourov expects continued growth in Polygon at the expense of Solana.       ""Non-Ethereum based solutions, such as Solana, may suffer in the short-term due to Polygon's growth,"" Vinokourov said. ""The dominance of Polygon will most likely strengthen going forward, and its positioning as an aggregator could boost interest in the sector as a whole and support a wide variety of Ethereum-scaling solutions.""      Indeed, Ethereum's scalability could improve, bringing transaction fees down once the sharding upgrade is implemented. However, Polygon's Sandeep Nailwal doesn't foresee Ethereum's improved scalability affecting demand for sidechains.      ""Ethereum 2.0 will become 64 times more scalable than Ethereum is now, but the demand is 1,000 times than where we are. You will need L2 scalability,"" Nailwal told CoinDesk.      Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin plans to implement the sharding upgrade after the completion of the switch to proof-of-stake mechanism by early next year.

The investment vehicle, which will trade under the ticker symbol DEFI, aims to back the next Uniswap.      DeFi’s endless summer continues with some $65.34 billion locked up in platforms, according to DeFi Pulse. The Dispersion listing could be a smart move because many talk about “institutional DeFi” but nobody is sure exactly how large firms will play in this experimental realm. As such, Dispersion could be seen as proxy DeFi exposure without having to dirty any hands with cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and smart contract-based market making.      Read more: Next Step for Institutional DeFi? Institutional NFTs      The time may be ripe for crypto endeavors thinking of going public, most recently evidenced by the glitzy listing of Coinbase earlier this month. Argo Blockchain reported annual profits for the first time, and its co-founders recently listed a non-fungible token (NFT) investment fund on Aquis.      Dispersion’s directors include Argo Blockchain co-founder Michael Edwards and Timothy Le Druillenec, a director of the NFT vehicle.      “We are going to be investing in early-stage DeFi projects that are built on top of the Ethereum ecosystem, the Binance ecosystem, the Polkadot ecosystem,” Dispersion CEO Michael Edwards said in an interview. “So, helping to scale and grow those companies and also create new companies the way we did with Argo.”      Dispersion has £11 million ($15.3 million) to deploy, having raised £2 million on the pre-IPO round, and £9 million on the IPO round. Investors in the IPO round included U.K. asset manager Schroders. On admission, Dispersion will have 612,500,000 ordinary shares in issue, giving the company a market capitalization of approximately £18 million, said Edwards.      “One place that we're exploring is what’s been called the ‘metaverse,’” said Edwards. “So, asset classes at the intersection of NFTs, gaming, esports and everything that's happening there.

Greenberg offered to send $250,000 in the cryptocurrency to Roger Stone, a political consultant tied to former U.S. President Donald Trump, as a fee for Stone securing a pardon for Greenberg, The Daily Beast said, citing screenshots of Signal messages the former Florida official allegedly sent.      “If I get you $250K in bitcoin, would that help or is this not a financial matter?” Greenberg reportedly wrote.      The disclosure is part of a broader story about U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, who is reportedly being investigated by federal officials for an alleged sexual relationship with a minor.      Federal prosecutors have charged Greenberg with a number of legal violations, including sex trafficking of a child. Gaetz, a member of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, is said to be under investigation as part of Greenberg’s case, and Greenberg is cooperating with the investigation, according to the New York Times.      The Daily Beast reported Thursday it had also acquired a confession letter Greenberg wrote as part of his effort to secure a pardon. The letter implicates Gaetz in the allegations of sex with a minor, according to the news site.      “On more than one occasion, this individual was involved in sexual activities with several of the other girls, the congressman from Florida’s 1st Congressional District and myself,” Greenberg is reported to have penned in late 2020.      Gas money, gifts, rent or partial tuition payments are among the methods Greenberg alleges he and Gaetz used, including to the individual under the age of 18, according to the article. Payments using Square's Cash App, PayPal's Venmo and other tools were made to the girls on “behalf of the congressman,” according to the report.
