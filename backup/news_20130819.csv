42416880,eB3NjBN6VPjgNZ6DbOxhGg,1376927524,Print paper bitcoin and litecoin wallets with Piper,"When looking for a secure way to store your bitcoin wallet details, paper wallets are one way to go. Software engineer Chris Cassano has a solution in the form of Piper wallet. It's a self-contained device that generates strong keys and prints them on a till-roll for safe keeping.  The Piper wallet is a Raspberry Pi powered device that can either be used as a standalone machine, or can be connected to a display (via HDMI), keyboard (and mouse), and even a USB printer.  As we recently saw with the flaw in the Android operating system, the randomness of numbers used to generate a private encryption key is crucial to protecting your wallet. Because bitcoin uses elliptic curve key cryptography, it's possible to reverse engineer a wallet's private key if the random numbers used in their generation and subsequent transactions are at all predictable.  Cassano claims that the hardware random number generator used in his Raspberry Pi based device satisfies all 26 of the ""diehard"" random number statistical analysis tests. In addition to being printed, private keys can be backed up on to a USB key in JSON format (as used by blockchain.info and others).  In addition to bitcoin wallets, the Piper Wallet also supports Litecoin and works with the Electrum desktop bitcoin client.  Piper Wallet uses a thermal printer rather than laying down ink. Thermal printing uses a special paper that is coated with a chemical that changes colour when exposed to heat. This means you won't have to spend money on ink to keep the device running. Cassano claims that the prints produced by the Piper will last for 10 years if kept in a cool, dark and dry environment.  There are two versions of the Piper Wallet, respectively based on the Model A and Model B Raspberry Pi designs. The Piper Wallet models cost 1.95 BTC ($199) and 2.14 BTC ($219) respectively.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | LTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/08/19/print-paper-bitcoin-and-litecoin-wallets-with-piper,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/91ecb4d9657a6fdb5b41338314783da60478a63d-640x480.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42416878,eB3NjBN6VPjgNZ6DbOxhEe,1376921781,Butterfly Labs Monarch miner announcement angers customers,"Article updated on 27th August at 14:37 BST  Butterfly Labs  has announced a new PCI bitcoin mining card, named Monarch, based on the new 28nm technology. Butterfly Labs claims the Monarch will achieve 600 GH/s and consume 350W. The release has courted controversy with customers who are still awaiting delivery of their longstanding 65nm-based products.  The Monarch has been optimised to work when connected to a PCIe slot, however, it also has a USB port, which allows it to be used with Windows and Linux computers and even Android devices. Butterfly Labs boasts that the card will achieve 600 Gigahashes per second (+/- 20%), and will cost $4,680 ($7.80 per GH/s), and consume 350 Watts (0.6 W per GH).  It's fair to say that Butterfly Labs has earned a poor reputation because of its consistently late deliveries. For example, its first-generation entry-level miner, the Jalapeño, was eventually delivered to customers six months after it was supposed to ship (promised November 2012, started shipping April 2013). The Bitforce 500 and Bitforce SC 60 were also released earlier this year, falling short of their projected specifications. Butterfly Labs is still struggling to keep up with its massive list of backorders, however, some customers are receiving new hardware:    My upgraded Bitcoin-Miner with new hardware from @ButterflyLabs :) pic.twitter.com/CEDEyxpUyf      — Simon Bräuer (@redshark1802) August 16, 2013        Butterfly Labs makes a point of stating on the product page that this mining device will not be shipping any time soon, but ""towards the end of the year"". It further states that those not comfortable waiting for so long should not pre-order.  For those interested in the product, Butterfly Labs has an offer for customers who are waiting for 65nm miners to transfer their current orders and apply the credit towards the Monarch. The catch is that doing so will be subject to a 10% transfer fee.  This has understandably raised the ire of many existing customers:    @butterflylabs your priorities are wrong stop doing more gear and ship our old orders... upset about.. http://t.co/eQNlMxzWIR      — mr.ebola (@mrebola) August 18, 2013        Recent months have seen Butterfly Labs customers being refused refunds, which has further added to anxieties of those with large sums of money tied up in products that have not yet arrived.  For example, a Bitcoin forum user reported: ""I just tried to get a refund and they refused. They should be tagged as a scammer as previously posted, especially now that they are refusing refunds (confirmed). They just refused mine in an email.""  Then, on Butterfly Lab's forum, a user reported the following response from the company: ""As stated on the order form, all sales are final. Unfortunately, we cannot give you a refund. We truly do appreciate your business.""  There has even been the cancellation of a group-buy on the Bitcoin forum: ""Ugh... I just read through the forum and the general consensus about this third BFL preorder is rather negative. I will stop this attempt of a group-buy before it even starts to minimize anger/grief/etc.""  Further to the ""all sales are final"" position, Butterfly Labs is not accepting PayPal as a method of payment for the Monarch; instead, only taking bitcoin or bank transfers as payment. Both of these are irreversible payment methods.  We asked Butterfly Labs COO, Josh Zerlan, about the company's refund history and he told us: ""Throughout that whole process, we gave customers the opportunity to cancel and get a full refund, culminating with a positive opt-in email where they had to agree that they understood we've screwed up the timeline and still want the product, otherwise we would cancel their order and refund their money, they wouldn't even have to do anything if they wanted a refund as we'd do it automatically.""  Zerlan also explained the lack of PayPal as a payment option for the Monarch: ""We do accept Paypal, just not on the Monarch. When you start doing Paypal transactions over a certain amount, it gets more complicated, which is why we elected not to do PayPal with the Monarch at it's nearly $5,000 price point. We still accept PayPal for all of our other products though.""  What do you think about Butterfly Labs? Have you received your hardware yet or are you still waiting? How have you found its customer service?

42416882,eB3NjBN6VPjgNZ6DbOxhMm,1376908699,"Germany officially recognises bitcoin as ""private money""","Article updated on August 19th at 14:31 (BST)  The German ministry of finance (Bundesministerium der Finanzen) has officially recognised bitcoin, mentioning the digital currency in a reply to an inquiry in parliament.  ""The German Ministry of Finance does not classify bitcoins as e-money or as a functional currency, they cannot be regarded as a foreign currency. Nevertheless they have to be subsumed under the German term of 'Rechnungseinheit' as a financial instrument,"" Martin Chaudhuri, of Bundesministerium der Finanzen, told CoinDesk.  German news website Die Welt reports Member of Parliament Frank Schäffler as saying that this is good news as, for the first time, the federal government is recognising bitcoins as private money.  A few weeks ago, Germany's financial regulator BaFin amended the German Banking Code to state that bitcoins are ""units of value"" and, therefore, can be classed as financial instruments.  Stefan Greiner, of German law firm Xenion Legal, said both this and the government's recognition of bitcoin are, in principle, positive for digital currencies.  ""Germany now is the first country in the world which has a clear cut set of rules applicable to bitcoins,"" he explained.  Greiner went on to say this could improve the access of bitcoin companies to VC funding as VC companies now have a ""manageable regulatory risk environment"".  ""This could also facilitate the cooperation between bitcoin companies and banks as banks now know where bitcoin companies are placed in the regulatory framework and which standards these companies must meet.""  Greiner believes these developments will raise the standards within the bitcoin space significantly as the companies involved are now regarded as financial services companies and must fulfil strict standards of operation. For example, companies are required to have an initial capital of 730,000 euros, certain professional qualifications of management and must report to BaFin.  Marco Streng, a bitcoin investor and trader based in Munich, agreed that the government's recognition of bitcoin is good news for the future of digital currency in Germany.  ""We can finally be more confident in dealing with bitcoins. Also it feels really good to have open-minded politicians like Frank Schäffler who can see the potential benefits of cryptocurrencies,"" he said.  ""I think that having bitcoin-related discussions on a governmental level and also having banks cooperating with bitcoin businesses gives us a special role in the global view of regulations and I hope this serves as a good example for other nations to follow,"" Streng added.  What is yet to be clarified is whether sales tax is due on commercial transactions involving bitcoin. Although it has been clarified that bitcoin is exempt from capital gains tax in Germany.  In the meantime, over in the US, the government has launched an inquiry to establish the potential of bitcoin and other virtual currencies. A letter from the US Senate Committee on Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs to the Department of Homeland Security states: ""As with all emerging technologies, the federal government must make sure that potential threats and risks are dealt with swiftly; however, we must also ensure that rash or uninformed actions don’t stifle a potentially valuable technology.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/08/19/germany-officially-recognises-bitcoin-as-private-money,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e6f7fd2e7959450997ad6a78672893ec7198335d-1024x681.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
