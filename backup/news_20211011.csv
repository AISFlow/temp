The most notable of this recovery has been the break above $57,000. This effectively set a new four-month high, hitting price points that have not been reached since the market had peaked in May. It is no doubt that the bulls currently have control of the market and investors&apos; sentiment is very positive with this. But CrossTower research analyst Martin Gaspar thinks this may only be the beginning of the rally.

The firms said Monday that Ripple will be the majority investor in the tie-up, which will fund solar energy projects throughout the United States.  The solar projects financed by the joint venture are estimated to offset over 1.5 million tons of carbon dioxide over 35 years, or about the same amount of carbon dioxide emissions from consuming 154 million gallons of gasoline, according to the companies.  “Guaranteeing a clean energy future is a major priority across every industry, not only to drive future economic growth but also to ensure a more sustainable world. As the adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain continues to grow, it’s evident that the technology will underpin our future financial systems,” said Ken Weber, Head of Social Impact at Ripple, in a press release. The investment is part of Ripple’s “commitment to reduce the carbon footprint of financial services globally and to deliver on the promise of a carbon negative cryptocurrency industry.”  The carbon footprint of the crypto industry is a longstanding concern, and this isn’t Ripple’s first eco-focused partnership.

In the YouTube interview, Simmons said he also owns bitcoin, ether (the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain) and litecoin, among others.  He said he bought bitcoin when the price was around $10,000. Lately it’s trading just above $57,000.  “All my cryptos have done very well,” Simmons said.

42412201,KEYN3b06rsSCg2kKkMJOoF,1633983826,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin All-Time High Expected, but Not Before a Pullback","Bullish sentiment continues to grow after bitcoin’s price broke above $57,000 on Monday. BTC is up about 3% over the past 24 hours, extending its outperformance compared to alternative cryptocurrencies.  Analysts see continued upside, with some calling for a return to the all-time high near $63,000 this quarter.  “The crypto rally is impressive since it occurred in the face of a broader risk-off environment in both equities and bonds, with crypto markets seemingly decoupling from the equities markets,” Coinbase wrote in a newsletter last week to institutional clients. “We are seeing BTC clearly lead this market up as evidenced by bitcoin dominance (BTC market cap relative to the total crypto market cap) reaching multi-month highs.”  The initial BTC spike last week could be the result of traders taking large positions ahead of a rumored approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of a futures-based bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), according to CoinDesk’s Lawrence Lewitinn.  For now, technicals suggest the current rally is due for a pullback. The recent uptrend appears to be exhausted, according to Katie Stockton, managing director of Fairlead Strategies. Stockton expects about two weeks of price consolidation toward $47,000-$48,000, which is where the September sell-off stabilized.  Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $57,542, +3.9%  Ether (ETH): $3,527, +0.0%  S&P 500: -0.6%  Gold: $1,755, -0.1%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.612%  Bitcoin all-time high within reach  The options market is placing a 20% probability on bitcoin ending the month at a new all-time high above $65,000, according to data provided by Skew. BTC is currently about 10% below the all-time high of $64,863 reached on April 14.  Analysts expect further upside due to the resurgence of buying activity and seasonal strength in the fourth quarter.  “Today’s leg higher, after a dull weekend session, keeps the bullish technical pattern of higher lows and higher highs in place, pushing BTC toward the double top around $59,580 made in May,” Nick Cawley, strategist at DailyFX, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  A break above $59,000 could place bitcoin closer to the all-time high, so long as the downside remains limited around $53,000, according to Cawley.  Crypto funds see inflows  Crypto-focused funds took in more than double the amount of new money last week than they did the prior week as bullish sentiment returned to the bitcoin market, reported CoinDesk’s Lyllah Ledesma.  The jump was largely driven by bitcoin-focused funds, where inflows rose to $225 million, the highest in five months, according to a report Monday from digital asset manager CoinShares.  However, Ethereum-focused funds, which had gained in recent months as bitcoin funds were mostly flat to down, saw minor outflows last week, totaling $14 million.

42394407,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvczpl,1633982679,Bitcoin Mining Is Reshaping the Energy Sector and No One Is Talking About It,"Recently, I was invited to give a talk at the Texas Blockchain Summit on the topic of the growth of bitcoin mining in Texas. Not knowing anything about bitcoin mining in Texas, I interrogated around two dozen mining entrepreneurs, wholesale energy traders, academics and energy experts. What I discovered would completely alter my views on bitcoin mining.  Put shortly, bitcoin mining is converging with the energy sector with amazing rapidity, yielding an explosion of innovation that will both decarbonize bitcoin in the medium term, and will dramatically benefit increasingly renewable grids. What’s more, it appears that only bitcoin – rather than other industrial load sources – can actually achieve some of these goals.  Bitcoin mining is suitable for renewables – and the proof is in the pudding  Bitcoin enthusiasts have long maintained that bitcoin mining could drive a clean energy transition. The logic went as follows: Bitcoin miners voraciously buy the cheapest sources of energy available; renewable (wind and solar) sources of energy are getting progressively cheaper and will soon outmatch thermal energy on cost; bitcoin miners will therefore subsidize the buildout of renewable energy, benefiting everyone.  I was long suspicious of this argument, due to the acknowledged low capacity factors exhibited by wind and solar sources of energy. Given that miners enter a race against time to get the most out of their new mining machines before hashrate climbs and they become uneconomical to run, putting those miners to work with low-uptime solar or wind energy wouldn’t make sense. Indeed, this was a common critique leveled at bitcoiners promoting this narrative: that renewables weren’t suitable for bitcoin mining.  However, a few new developments within the mining market completely changed my mind on this. I now firmly believe that bitcoin mining is suitable for and beneficial to renewable energy, both on a first order and second order (indirect) basis. The key developments that changed my view are the following:  The emergence of the “lifecycle mining” concept  The development of a new hybrid model for bitcoin mining that is partially grid-based and partially “behind the meter” mining  The slowing of ASIC development cycles.  Lifecycle mining is a concept I learned of at a talk given by Ro Shirole of miner Compute North at the Bitmain Mining Disrupt summit in Miami. In short, it refers to the concept that the energy inputs and datacenter model that miners employ should be tailored to the age of the hardware. Effectively, the practice of mining is becoming heterogeneous across hardware vintages: the type of energy deployed depends on how old your machines are. Newer units generally go in higher-assurance data centers, and get plugged into reliable energy with high uptime assurances. This is generally grid energy and inherits its carbon intensity – normally a mix of high and low carbon sources. If you have latest-gen units, you want to take advantage of them right away before hashrate climbs. Thus you can afford to pay a bit more for power, because they’re more profitable.  For older units, like Bitmain S9s, which are five years old at this point and still represent 30% of the network, according to Coin Metrics, the considerations are quite different. These units head to “ASIC retirement homes,” where they can take more interruption. Operators with these units look instead for dirt cheap power. If the economics make sense, they will run them.  Read More: The Frustrating, Maddening, All-Consuming Bitcoin Energy Debate | Nic Carter  Thus while grid energy – or more stable, low-carbon sources like nuclear or hydro – is most suitable for high-end ASICs, more intermittent renewables, even at a capacity factor of 70%, make sense for older units. The opportunity cost is much lower with older units, so they can be placed alongside a more intermittent renewable source of energy and still be economical.  Additionally, a new hybrid model for Bitcoin mining is emerging. Bitcoin miners can buy energy from energy providers when energy is abundant (as in West Texas with an excess of wind and solar), drawing from the grid the rest of the time. In so doing, the miners monetize a renewable asset that would otherwise be dumped into the ground, while maintaining generally high uptime. During periods of energy scarcity, the miners can be turned off. The net effect is that renewables become more economical, as they can monetize their asset even when the grid has no demand for it.  Critics either don’t understand this concept or deliberately misrepresent reality. For instance, Popular Science claims that “there are no excess renewables,” citing an academic stating “if bitcoin miners or cryptocurrency miners are going to take that renewable, that means it’s not there for somebody else to use.” This is blatantly untrue, as demonstrated by hydro power use in Sichuan. In Texas, the western portion of the grid boasts 32 GW of capacity (much of it wind and solar), 5 GW of load and only 12 GW of transmission to load centers elsewhere in Texas. The rest of the power is habitually curtailed, and it’s no wonder that bitcoin miners are flocking to the region.  Alex De Vries, the notorious Bitcoin energy critic (who created Digiconomist and works for the Dutch central bank) claims that miners are “the ideal customer for obsolete fossil fuels rather than renewables since these are both cheap and a source of constant power.” One wonders how he will react to news of low-carbon energy providers engaging with bitcoin miners to serve as a source of additional offtake.  Already, we know that hydro (which gets curtailed seasonally) has historically been a huge source of supply for bitcoin miners, and remains one, in Canada, Russia, Washington state and New York. Now, miners are signing up deals with nuclear power plants (which often produce excess power at night, when the grid is less demanding). It’s only a matter of time before solar and wind energy producers begin to take advantage of bitcoin mining as an additional, uncorrelated buyer. Already, we see Norwegian energy giant Aker declaring their intention to use bitcoin as a “load-balancing economic battery” and to become a “valuable partner to new renewable projects.” Blockstream and Square are partnering on a solar-powered mining facility.  Lastly, as ASIC releases get more infrequent – and they are undeniably slowing down, due to the physical limits being reached at the transistor level – miners are more incentivized to find cheap energy, rather than racing to get the latest units active. Despite the absolutely comical claims by critics that ASICs last only 1.29 years, ASICs are lasting longer and longer, and new cycles are less and less frequent. This means that miners can take a longer-term focus and work to find cheap, renewable sources of energy.  Flared gas mitigation is as close to a free lunch as you can get  I first heard about mining as an alternative use for waste methane from Steve Barbour of Upstream Data, who is acknowledged as having pioneered the concept in 2017. For a long time, it was considered a bit of a pipe dream, destined to remain a highly niche sector in the mining space. However, today there are a number of well-funded companies actively deploying assets in the flared gas mitigation space. These include Giga Energy, Crusoe Energy, Great American Mining, Nakamotor Partners, Jai Energy and Upstream.  Mining with waste methane at oil wells makes perfect sense because it is a natural byproduct of oil extraction, especially during “initial production” when you get a huge, short term burst of gas. Many oil wells are completely remote from pipeline infrastructure, and due to the prices of natural gas, do not find it economical to transport the methane to refineries. Thus they simply opt to flare the gas (venting it would be far worse, as raw methane is a much worse greenhouse gas than CO2, the output of the combustion). But flaring is inefficient, and on windy days, much of the methane is not consumed in the reaction.  What bitcoin miners do instead is capture the natural gas, pipe it into a generator present on the well pad, and use that energy to power bitcoin miners. This is a more complete, controlled burn and therefore reduces emissions associated with the alternative in which the gas is flared. The systems deployed in the field are highly modular and transportable – if a well is producing an abundance of natural gas following initial production, miners can come in for the first six months and take advantage of that initial burst, which wouldn’t otherwise be captured (since no operator would build a pipeline for a short term glut of cheap gas).  It’s no surprise that Texas Sen. Ted Cruz extolled the practice in his recent comments at the Texas Blockchain Summit:  “Fifty percent of the natural gas in this country that is flared, is being flared in the Permian right now in West Texas. I think that is an enormous opportunity for bitcoin, because that’s right now energy that is just being wasted. It’s being wasted because there is no transmission equipment to get that natural gas where it could be used the way natural gas would ordinarily be employed; it’s just being burned.”  The common response to the flared gas mitigation use case is that we shouldn’t be extracting any hydrocarbons, period, and thus waste gas miners are still producing illegitimate emissions. This talking point is aimed to delegitimize the excellent work that bitcoin miners working with otherwise flared gas are doing to manage this waste product in an efficient and low-emission way.  But this is a fundamentally Malthusian stance: We are nowhere near a move to a non-fossil fuel energy standard, and to do so would be suicide on a civilizational scale. Cut off natural gas, for instance, and billions of individuals will not be able to heat their homes in winter. Curtail petroleum use, and our transport system will fail. The globalized system of trade would collapse. Farmers, lacking fertilizers, will not be able to feed the earth’s population. Death and famine at a mass scale would directly follow an abrupt end of oil and gas extraction.  For now, until we invent nuclear fusion, alternative fuel types or some other energy golden bullet, oil extraction will remain a civilizational necessity. If the critics aren’t willing to live in the counterfactual world where we cease using hydrocarbons, the seriousness of the critique should be questioned.  The other objection to flaring is that it should be regulated out of existence, as many states in the U.S. have done. But this wouldn’t stop flaring – all it would do would be to make hydrocarbon extraction more expensive and unwieldy in the U.S., advantaging oil extraction abroad. A ban on flaring, if it raised costs for producers, would simply cause the U.S. to import more oil from overseas.  Foreign states like Saudi Arabia and Nigeria have no qualms whatsoever about flaring. As long as the world has a need for oil – and this won’t change anytime soon – there will be waste gas produced at the well pad. Bitcoin miners are undeniably the best positioned to sustainably mitigate this waste product – and also protect a global monetary network while they’re at it.  Flexible load allows grids to accommodate more renewables  Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, a new feature of bitcoin mining has begun to gain traction, to the benefit of power grid operators. Bitcoin miners represent “interruptible load,” which means that they can deal with power outages without suffering adverse impacts to their business. Of course, they prefer to have power all of the time, but nothing catastrophic happens when they lose power, unlike other industrial consumers such as hospitals, high-end data centers, factories and smelters.  This makes them perfect for so-called “demand response” programs, which refers to formal or informal agreements to curtail their demand when the grid is overtaxed and prices are high. This means that when energy is in short supply, bitcoin miners can turn themselves off and get power to the households that need it most.  In exchange for agreeing to have their power interrupted some percentage of the time, miners get rebates, so it’s economically worthwhile to opt into these programs. Even if miners aren’t participating in an explicit rebate program, surging market prices during shortages in deregulated grids like ERCOT send miners the signal to turn themselves off.  During his remarks in Austin, Texas, Sen. Ted Cruz demonstrated his familiarity with the concept, pointing out the benefit of having bitcoin miners on the grid as a source of interruptible load.  Even more compellingly, miners can serve as a source of “controllable load,” which is a concept I learned from Lancium. This means that miners can can dial up and down their consumption to a level the grid operator demands – within seconds. Instead of tweaking the supply side, like turning on gas turbines to make up for a sudden interruption of wind, grid operators can instead ask mining data center operators to dial down their consumption. Having this option means fossil-fuel powered peaker plants don’t need to be triggered as often.  The flexibility of these miners is not going unnoticed. The 2020 state of the market report from the ERCOT independent market monitor marvels at 100MW worth of new data centers (all mining Bitcoin) using “fast acting control systems” that enrolled as Controllable Load Resources. Grid operators have rarely encountered such flexible consumers of energy, and it has taken them some time to design appropriate programs to take advantage of these resources.  More demand-side control for grid operators means fewer carbon-intense peaker plants. And due to the growing influence of renewables on grids like that of Texas, more flexible load is welcome. Wind and solar, unlike coal plants, hydro or nuclear, don’t produce energy reliably. Their intermittency means they need to be backstopped by batteries (mostly uneconomical at present), or gas-powered turbines.  More controllable load however alleviates this intermittency without requiring more fossil fuels. A new paperhttps://lancium.com/press/flexible-data-center-whitepaper/ from Texas energy academics finds that more controllable load would actually assist in decarbonizing the grid. In their words, “Operating the data centers in a flexible manner during times of high grid prices could lead to the deployment of even more wind and solar and – if they are operated with enough flexibility – could result in lower overall carbon emissions.”  During the conference, Cruz compared bitcoin mining to fracking, another innovation that has been much maligned by environmental activists, but has contributed to energy independence in the U.S. and actually led the decarbonization of the U.S. grid, as natural gas has around half the carbon intensity of coal.  His comments were apt: Bitcoin mining appears to be wholly consistent with the goals of environmentalists in the U.S., as it safeguards grids made unstable by new wind and solar assets; monetizes hydro and nuclear when the grid is not a buyer; and settles into off-grid niches like waste natural gas. That he has achieved this level of sophistication on the topic is truly remarkable, as bitcoin is not a policy priority of his. One can only hope that the rest of his Senate colleagues do the same.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | COMMODITY | MARKET | MINING,Nic Carter,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/11/bitcoin-mining-is-reshaping-the-energy-sector-and-no-one-is-talking-about-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3c8835fc4cdd405bf8f9e00aa7bb586a73f82ed6-6016x4016.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394410,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvd059,1633982058,The Financialization of NFTs Raises Regulatory Issues,"Last Wednesday, the good people over at TechCrunch ran a story about a company called Visionrare, which is essentially trying to gamify the process of investing in startups.  It’s a play on the “fantasy betting” concept that’s already popular in the world of sports and culture. Fantasy football brackets let fans make predictions without actually putting any money down, and fantasy stock markets let investors hone their skills in a simulated environment, where the stakes aren’t quite so high. There’s a similar system for betting on the outcome of the TV show “The Bachelor”.  Visionrare is trying to do the same thing with investments in startups: Log onto the site, “invest” in a real company and see how it performs over time. If your company lands a big funding round in real life, your in-game portfolio appreciates in value.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The “Ender’s Game” twist here is that for about 24 hours, Visionrare was asking users to stock their portfolios with actual money.  “VisionShares are NFTs (non-fungible tokens) that live on the blockchain,” reads a section on the company’s FAQ page. “This way, players have real ownership over their fantasy equity, and there is a provable scarcity of the virtual equity of each company.”  The “investments” weren’t real in the sense that putting money into a company via Visionrare didn’t actually get you any equity, but buying a VisionShare would get you an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain. Hence, “real ownership over… fantasy equity.”  Visionrare’s open beta launched on Wednesday and shut down less than a day later, thanks to a swift backlash in the wake of TechCrunch’s piece.  In addition to being an ouroboric nightmare, Visionrare is a good reminder of the dangers of financialization.  For better or worse, crypto is great at assigning discrete monetary value to things we’re used to understanding as free. NFTs can put a price on media files, and tokens for crypto-backed social clubs and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) can turn online communities into investment collectives. On a fully crypto-backed internet, photos, videos, memes, likes and avatars are all ultimately investment opportunities.  Visionrare seemed to underestimate the power of that idea. There’s a market for NFTs because crypto’s nouveau riche have cash to burn, and parking it in NFTs lets them keep their chips in the casino, but also because there’s also an understanding that buying the token doesn’t get you anything but the token. It works, for now, because NFTs operate like digital certificates of ownership. But they are fundamentally incompatible with equity in a traditional company. NFTs and token equity models work for DAOs, because they’re essentially on-chain, unregulated versions of traditional companies; without that anchor in the “real” world; there’s more leeway for digital assets to represent actual ownership.  Marrying “off-chain” and “on-chain” assets can also pose significant regulatory risks. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has a history of going after crypto assets that bear a resemblance to traditional equities, and Visionrare’s decision to allow trades from the U.S. was a little like playing with fire.  “Since our launch, we have learned thanks to people who reached out to us that we might have been too optimistic when it comes to the legal aspects of what we were doing, especially when dealing with regulators,” wrote Visionrare’s CEO, Jacob Claerhout, in the company’s Discord server.  There’s a sense, in tech, that people will just give you money if you go around saying words like “DAO” and “NFT.” Blockchain technology is good for certain things – logistics, recordkeeping, certain kinds of investing – but the reality is that some things don’t need crypto.  To its credit, Visionrare has said it’s giving back all the money users spent on its NFTs. And the community remains surprisingly upbeat, thanks in large part to the ethos of company leadership: Claerhout and the company’s other co-founder, Boris Gordts, are 20-something strivers with ambitions that click with other young people in the crypto sector. Their earnest, attentive vibe seems to have put users at ease.  “We’re growing, building and learning in public,” Claerhout told me in a DM.  The company plans to return this Friday, with a new “free-to-play model” and new NFTs. Claerhout declined to elaborate on how exactly those NFTs – which are inherently speculative assets with the ability to spawn secondary markets – would be dissociated from the financial aspect. But he said they would operate more like “badge[s] of honor showcasing valuable contributions” than equities.  In a blog post this morning, the Visionrare team claimed its 24-hour experiment was somehow in line with U.S. securities laws, describing it as “according to us, compliant.”  “[We are] honored to have fueled a global debate on how to democratize startup investment through crypto,” the post said.

42415749,WkWFu5l5TZXnF1B32UXK1Z,1633978926,Dying for a Bitcoin Futures ETF? Watch Out for ‘Contango Bleed’,"Improved prospects of the U.S. approving a futures-based bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) has brought cheer to the crypto market.  However, the fund may fail to match bitcoin’s price performance thanks to a scary-sounding market dynamic known as “contango bleed.” This refers to fund underperformance that could theoretically occur because longer-dated futures contracts are trading at higher prices than shorter-dated contracts.  In commodities markets, it’s considered normal for prices on longer-dated contracts to trade above those on shorter-dated contracts; this is known as “contango.” The price spread often roughly correlates with the cost of storage – such as for oil or soybeans. There’s also the time value of money: the foregone yield that an investor might get from socking money into interest-bearing securities like U.S. Treasury bonds. In the bitcoin market, contango mainly results from bullish price expectations.  Such contango could prove a liability, though, if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approves a bitcoin-futures ETF. Several futures ETF proposals are due for regulatory approval in the coming weeks, of which the ProShares’ product is widely expected to receive accreditation on Oct. 18. Investors who pile into these new funds could get hit with “contango bleed,” where they might get lower returns than if they had simply bought bitcoin directly.  The dynamic shows one potential downside from the SEC’s preference for an ETF based on bitcoin futures over one that buys bitcoin directly. While Gensler has suggested that a futures-based ETF might be less risky for investors because it’s rooted in regulatory commodity markets – bitcoin futures are traded on the Chicago-based CME exchange – the “contango bleed” might represent a consistent source of underperformance.  “The futures-based ETF, if approved, will be an inefficient product,” Ilan Solot, global market strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, told CoinDesk. “Because bitcoin’s futures curve is typically in contango, the fund is going to suffer from a negative rollover.”  “I am expecting the average negative yield to be at around 5%-10% on the CME bitcoin futures curve,” said Patrick Heusser, head of trading at Swiss-based Crypto Finance AG. In plain English, if the price of bitcoin doubles in the next 12 months, the ETF would underperform by at least 5%-10%.  Futures-based ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to the underlying asset via a futures contract – an obligation to buy or sell the underlying at a later date at an agreed-upon price. The contracts expire once a month so the rollover is needed for investors to maintain the exposure.  However, the process often results in a loss because on the expiry day the contract due for settlement tends to converge with the spot price, while the out-month contracts still trade at a premium. Investors might end up selling the contract due for expiry at a loss and buying the next one at a high price.  Unhedged investors would still benefit from any underlying gains in bitcoin’s price – just not as much, because of the contango bleed.  “If the futures curve is in contango and the serial months are all premium to the preceding, you are bleeding the difference between the months every month,” said one trader for a major crypto exchange, who asked not to be named because of employer-imposed restrictions on making public statements.  The CME data shows bitcoin’s October expiry contract is currently trading at $58,000, for a premium of roughly $500 over the spot price, while the November expiry is changing hands at $58,500, or a premium around $1,000.  Assume a newly approved bitcoin futures ETF purchases the October contract at the current price.  By month’s end the premium in the October contract would likely evaporate. So when the fund resets its exposure, it could end up selling the October contract at a loss of $500 or 0.86% (annualized 10.34%) and then having to buy the subsequent month’s contract at a premium.  The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, widely expected to receive approval on Oct. 18, mentions the rollover risk in its prospectus as a key risk for investors: “Extended periods of contango could cause significant losses for the fund.”  “We’ve seen this phenomenon in commodities and other futures markets for years,” Trey Griggs, CEO at crypto trading firm GSR, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. “When the forward curve is in contango, particularly steep contango, long-only ETF and ETN [exchange-traded note] investors get nickel-and-dimed each month by having to pay the roll.”  “Often, the price investors pay for the roll exceeds the absolute return of the underlying, causing the investment to earn negative yield even in a rising price environment,” Triggs added. In such cases, the fund tends to lose value over time, as evidenced by the futures ETF tied to Chicago Board Options Exchange’s volatility index (VIX).  “The $VXX is a VIX ETF and suffers from strong contango bleed,” trader and analyst Alex Kruger tweeted. “This is how its long-term chart looks like. Yes, it looks like death. You never go long $VXX unless for a short period of time.”  “The roll period is different for every asset,” one trader from a crypto exchange said. “Historically, the roll period on the CME has usually occurred in the last week before contract expiration.”  Negative roll not seen as a big deterrent  According to experts, the prospect of a futures ETF underperforming bitcoin is unlikely to deter investors from pouring money into the product.  “Investors simply want exposure to the asset class and will look the other way if there is a slight roll charge,” GSR’s Griggs said. “In our view, the only way the roll charge will prevent investor interest in a BTC ETF is for the forward market to be in very steep contango, far steeper than we’ve previously seen in BTC futures.”  If contango steepens, fund managers could change strategy and hold more than just the front-month futures contract.  ProShares’ ETF proposal says: “The Advisor will utilize active management techniques to seek to mitigate the negative impact or, in certain cases, benefit from the contango or backwardation present in the various futures contract markets, but there can be no guarantee that it will be successful in doing so.” Backwardation is the opposite of contango.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/11/dying-for-a-bitcoin-futures-etf-watch-out-for-contango-bleed,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/38d3f5f8879683532d959a0c6c4f2659c4d47356-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Digital asset investment products saw a total of $226 million in inflows during the week ended last Friday, up from $90 million the week before.  The jump was largely driven by bitcoin-focused funds, where inflows rose by $156 million to $225 million, the highest in five months, according to a report Monday from digital asset manager CoinShares.  The resurgence in interest in bitcoin funds came as the largest cryptocurrency’s price rose last week to a five-month high. The crypto was recently trading at around $57,300.  The last time bitcoin saw inflows this high was in May, when its price was about $58,500 on its way down from the all-time high of nearly $65,000 reached earlier in the year. Bitcoin’s price subsequently fell to as low as $29,000 in July, but has recently staged a fresh rally, up 20% in October alone.  The Gensler effect  Ethereum-focused funds, which had gained in recent months as bitcoin funds were mostly flat to down, saw minor outflows last week, totaling $14 million. Funds focused on alternative blockchains Litecoin, Ripple and Polkadot also saw outflows last week.  The authors of the CoinShares report attributed the uptick in bitcoin flows to recent statements by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler, who has hinted that the regulatory agency might be willing to approve an exchange-traded fund linked to bitcoin futures. Gensler also notably said last week that he has no intention of banning cryptocurrencies.  “We believe the turnaround in sentiment towards bitcoin is due to constructive statements from SEC chair Gary Gensler, potentially allowing a bitcoin ETF in the U.S.,” the report stated.  Some other altcoin-focused funds continued to see gains. Investment vehicles focused on Solana’s SOL token saw inflows of $12.5 million, while funds linked to Cardano’s ADA token took in $3 million.

On Monday, the U.S. wing of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire said its new marketplace, FTX NFTs, will allow users to trade, mint, auction and authenticate Solana-based NFTs. It plans to soon support NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain, the home to the bulk of non-fungibles trading.  The exchange’s prioritization of Solana instead highlights two realities: Bankman-Fried is heavily invested in the Solana ecosystem; and that ecosystem, while host to a handful of so-called “blue chip” projects, doesn’t yet have a juggernaut marketplace for NFT trading.  Instead, it features a scattered array of lesser-known marketplaces sometimes hosted by projects themselves. Solanart and Solsea both charge 3% sales fees. FTX.US says its new platform will charge 2%.  The choice could bolster Solana’s bid for a bigger slice of the NFT business. The blockchain is faster and cheaper to use than Ethereum’s is. That hasn’t been enough to convince the vast majority of NFT traders to move over, however.  FTX said it will support all Solana NFTs that follow NFT protocol Metaplex’s standard. It won’t allow users to list revenue-sharing projects and is capping artist royalty schemes at 40%.  FTX’s offering will be different from those found on Ethereum’s top NFT marketplaces, such as OpenSea. It is open only to users with an FTX account linked to their real-world identity, meaning an anonymous crypto wallet address won’t be enough.  The marketplace will also support credit card purchases and bank transfers, as well as crypto.  “If you look at every NFT marketplace, they’re all trying to achieve” a more seamless buying experience, said Fanny Lakoubay, who runs an NFT advisory service in New York.

The crypto exchange allows users to buy 94 cryptocurrencies online with euros, CEO and co-founder Pedro Borges told CoinDesk, adding that users can also trade those cryptocurrencies for an additional 398 other cryptos.  In June, the Central Bank of Portugal (Banco de Portugal) licensed Criptoloja as a “virtual asset service provider,” making it the first crypto company licensed to operate since a new law covering crypto trading platforms in Portugal took effect earlier this year.  In August, the company started offering an offline trading service. “We were doing the pure broker work, exchanging euros for the crypto requested and sending it to the client’s wallet,” Borges said, adding that the company has only 317 users so far. “Small numbers, but this is just starting,” he said.  To start trading, customers must send euros to one of two accounts Criptoloja holds at two local banks, Totta Santander and Abanca. Customers must also provide an identity document, and ownership of the bank account and Criptoloja’s account must be the same, Borges said.  Once users acquire some cryptocurrency, they can hold their assets on Cryptoloja’s platform, which has an integrated third-party custody service, Borges said. He declined to disclose the custodian’s name.  So far, the exchange offers its service only on desktops, although it expects to launch a mobile app by the end of 2021.  On the institutional side, Criptoloja plans to be the exchange partner for Portuguese companies that are already receiving payments in crypto and need to convert them to euros.  And by the end of October, the company plans to start providing services in Spain from Portugal. “Spanish clients will be opening the account with the Portuguese company,” Borges said. “For that we just have to inform Banco do Portugal that we are [offering] commercial efforts in Spain.”  Criptoloja’s license approval came after nearly nine months, as it first filed its application in September 2020, Borges told CoinDesk.

He highlighted how bitcoin rallied over 2,400% before the day bitcoin futures were listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in 2017, followed by an 83% bear market .  This year, the bitcoin market rose 822% coming into the day of Coinbase’s Nasdaq listing, peaking at $64,863 that day and then starting a 53% bear-market slump, Morehead wrote.  Morehead’s comments come after analysts and investors recently attributed the rally in bitcoin to speculation the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will soon approve a bitcoin ETF. The SEC last week approved the Volt Crypto Industry Revolution and Tech ETF, which aims to provide investors with exposure to publicly traded companies with exposure to bitcoin.  Many in the crypto community have speculated that, despite delays, the approval of a bitcoin ETF could happen by the end of the month. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has also repeatedly suggested that he is not opposed to the idea of a futures-based bitcoin ETF like those proposed by Valkyrie and BlockFi, which filed for a bitcoin futures ETF on Friday.

As of October 2021, the total crypto market cap is comfortably sitting at over $2.1 trillion, with 300 million users spread across the globe. These numbers might seem huge at first, but on further inspection, we realize that they are minuscule in comparison to our traditional financial systems. Even after cryptocurrencies successfully stood the test of time and flourished in the wake of the pandemic, their adoption rate seems to be low. This is mostly because of their lack of accessibility and liquidity. The truth is that the complex processing involved in the buying, selling, storing, and trading of cryptocurrencies deters people from getting involved in the decentralized space. Wallets like Metamask, where users can buy and store cryptos, are not user-friendly and DEXs do not accept fiat payments. So, beginners are only left with centralized exchanges to buy crypto from. To make things worse, users are forced to rely on too many platforms for their different needs in the crypto space, which becomes extremely difficult to manage.

42421032,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXBHWX,1633965281,How We Ranked the Top Universities for Blockchain,"Last year, CoinDesk released its inaugural Blockchain University Rankings in an attempt to both recognize the role that academic research has played in the development of blockchain technology, as well as quantify the impact of individual schools. Our goal was simple: offer the most rigorous and nuanced window into universities’ impact on the blockchain field.  Naturally, there were limitations, and as we began working on our 2021 rankings, mitigating as many of these limitations as we could was a primary objective.  To this end, we’ve made two major changes to our methodology this year. First, we included not only more schools, but a wider variety of schools – our field has expanded from 46 U.S.-based universities to more than 200 schools (230, to be exact) from around the globe. Second, we factored in “cost of attendance” to reflect a metric of growing concern for many current and future students.  Read more: The Top Universities for Blockchain by CoinDesk 2021  Above all, we want to ensure that these rankings do what they’re intended to do: offer a holistic snapshot of the intersection between this transformative technology and institutions of higher education. We believe that a transparent, intellectually defensible ranking can help condense what ends up being an incredible amount of difficult-to-find information (with innumerable factors) down into a more manageable format.  In the open-source spirit, we’d also like to reiterate our commitment to integrity and data transparency. We are more than happy to discuss and/or share our data, our methods or anything else about the project upon request.  Sample size  Our official sample size for these rankings was 230 individual schools, which is not nearly the total number of universities that exist around the world. To determine on which institutions to focus, we added schools to the list according to their ability to meet any one of three criteria.  First, we included any school that was listed in the top 100 of any one of the USNWR Best Global Universities (2021), the QS World University Rankings (2022), the ShanghaiRanking’s Academic Ranking of World Universities (2021), or the World University Rankings (2022). We also included any school that had been considered last year (2020) that was similarly based on aggregating outside rankings. This gave us a large initial sample.  This setup, however, if limited to just these two criteria, could pose a problem: What if a lower-ranked school (as judged by USNWR, QS, ARWU, or THE) is doing amazing work but fails to be considered simply because a few outside sources happened to overlook them in their global rankings? This is far from a desirable outcome.  On the other hand, we simply don’t have the resources to closely examine every school in existence, especially when relatively few of them are engaged in the kind of impactful blockchain work that is likely to lead to a place on our rankings.  Chart by Shuai Hao / CoinDesk  To balance these considerations, our third criteria was a compromise: When we released our qualitative survey, we also included a call for any school, anywhere in the world, to request inclusion/consideration in our rankings. By opening our criteria but placing the burden of requesting to be included on the schools themselves, we were able to remove any artificial limitations on which schools were considered while simultaneously maintaining a high level of confidence that any school that took the affirmative step of asking to be evaluated would ultimately be worth our time and resources to examine closely.  These final 230 institutions represent some of the best schools in existence today, and our final sample saw a mix of large, traditionally “elite” research institutions and smaller schools, from public to private, from free to expensive, with every continent (with the exception of Antarctica) represented.  Methodology  To determine final scores, we looked at five primary categories: (1) an institution’s strength in research and academic contributions to advancing the field; (2) the existing blockchain offerings on campus, whether in the form of classes, educational centers, clubs, etc.; (3) employment and industry outcomes; (4) cost of attendance; and (5) overall academic reputation.  Each category comprises multiple sub-categories, offering a holistic picture of a university’s presence in the blockchain space. For a final score, we assigned points to each institution proportional to their performance in each category, and normalized their final point totals on a scale from 0-100.  1) Scholarly impact: To determine a school’s scholarly impact score, we relied primarily on the Clarivate Web Of Science database. We took the total number of publications (all subjects) from each school, and narrowed them to include only blockchain- or cryptocurrency-related papers published between 2019-2021 (including forthcoming papers slated for 2022). From this set, we generated citation reports and created subsets in which the first author of the publication was affiliated with the university in question. The resulting data gave us the key metrics of (1) total blockchain research papers published by university affiliates, (2) how often these papers were cited, and rough numbers on (3) how often the primary researcher on a paper comes from a given institution (the “first author” convention being, of course, discipline dependent).  Raw numbers, however, don’t always tell the full story. A bigger school, with a larger faculty and a hefty endowment, may be putting out more blockchain research overall (while still managing to devote a relatively small percentage of its resources to the field), while a tiny school that dedicates a much more impressive percentage of its overall resources to blockchain research may end up with fewer papers simply due to a smaller overall headcount.  To account for this, we also normalized each data point (where applicable) against the total institutional output. When normalized in this way, a smaller university that is devoting a larger proportion of its research to blockchain will be rewarded relative to a more massive university who is able to pump out a greater quantity of research with less investment. In recognition of the fact that both raw output and targeted output are valuable metrics, both are factored into our rankings, along with the aggregated H-Index of a school’s blockchain publications. For anyone interested in reproducing our dataset, please ensure that a) you have full access to the Web of Knowledge and all Clarivate subscriptions; and b) use our query to filter the results: “cryptocurrenc* OR blockchai* OR bitcoi* OR ethereum OR stablecoi*”  2) Campus blockchain offerings: To arrive at a school’s blockchain offerings score, we examined multiple facets of their existing campus infrastructure. Campus course offerings are the largest single subcategory that we looked at. The number of available classes (especially when spread over multiple departments, providing an opportunity for a more robust education) shows a deep investment into the space both in the present and for the future. Faculty must be hired, curricula must be developed and administrative buy-in must be achieved. These are not done on a whim, and are usually quite permanent.  The second-largest factor in our rankings is the presence of a dedicated blockchain research center, although we also separately considered smaller initiatives and student-run clubs. Research centers and initiatives often offer unique opportunities for students to get involved in academic work or obtain hands-on experience, and can serve as a gravity well for novel ideas and thinkers (especially when these entities take the additional step of organizing conferences, summits or other educational events). Research centers, initiatives and clubs all allow students, faculty and the larger community to connect with other enthusiasts, and tend to provide a crucial tether between academia and industry.  Lastly, to round out this category, we gathered data on the nascent but ever-growing set of universities that offer blockchain-related degrees, whether at the graduate or undergraduate level and sometimes as a concentration within another degree. As a whole, the Campus Blockchain Offerings category is the most consequential component of our methodology.  3) Employment and industry outcomes: A university’s ability to place students into relevant jobs is an important metric for two reasons: one, it says something about an institution’s cache in the industry, either due to name recognition, personal connections, or institutional pipelines; and two, this is of particular importance to current and incoming students.  A student’s primary goal in obtaining a college education is, after all, often to secure a job in industry. To discover which schools are placing the most graduates in the blockchain field, we looked at the LinkedIn footprint of over 200 of the largest and most influential companies in the space, as well as their thousands and thousands of employees. To mitigate biases, we factored in both raw and normalized numbers. Raw numbers are useful for highlighting schools that are placing a high number of graduates into jobs, but larger schools in larger countries will tend to have an advantage simply because of sheer size.  Normalized numbers paint a more nuanced picture of hiring practices. To shed some light on our data, we tweaked our data in two additional ways. First, because we relied heavily on LinkedIn as a source, we found it prudent to get a sense of how accurate LinkedIn might be for different countries. To do this, we used each country’s size, higher education levels, and LinkedIn use to generate a multiplier for each university based on the expected number of hires that we may have missed. Countries with lower proportionate levels of LinkedIn use got a boost in terms of raw numbers.  Second, we also recognize that raw numbers can easily be inflated simply due to the size of a population. The University of Buenos Aires, for example, with its ~300,000 students, is much more likely to place 200 alums into blockchain jobs than someplace like Rockefeller University with its ~213 students.  The University of Buenos Aires placing 200 grads into blockchain is expected even with zero investment into the field, whereas Rockefeller placing that same number would be indicative of something closer to a school that is focused entirely on blockchain (highly unlikely, as Rockefeller is well-respected bio/medical sciences university). To account for this, we normalized against school size, as well.  To gather qualitative data, we also surveyed industry stakeholders and other non-students, non-academics to get a sense of how institutions are (subjectively) viewed by those who consider themselves to be outside of academia. This data was quantified numerically, as was information about the number of active industry partnerships (including sponsored research) maintained by each university.  4) Cost of attendance: To calculate a school’s Cost of Attendance score, we looked at both overall cost and a normalized construction of overall cost of attendance. We assumed here that lower tuition was preferable, and feel that we ought to acknowledge the important caveat that we only considered the base price of a university, while in actual practice, grants, scholarships, opportunity costs, and even residency can completely change an individual’s calculation. Along similar lines, tuition is a purely student-facing concern, while we hope that these rankings find use by non-students. Because of these concerns, our cost metric is, by weight, the least consequential component of our methodology.  Two pieces of data were factored in to generate this score. The first is tuition, with one note. Whenever possible, we assumed that an attendee would be from within the country but out of state when calculating tuition costs. Of course, some universities just have one flat fee. Others, however, charge different amounts of tuition for in-state (versus out of state), and have yet another fee schedule for international students. To capture the largest number of likely students, we consistently applied the “out of state but not out of country” tuition rule whenever necessary.  The second piece of data is a normalized cost of attendance. To determine this, we employed both salary data for the country in which the university is located and an external cost-of-living chart as proxy data to build a combined country-specific cost of living index. We then ran raw tuition data against this hybrid index to assign ranked scores to each university.  5) Academic reputation: In a perfect world, rankings would emphasize merit, and anonymized, quantifiable data would be sufficient to judge a university’s impact in the blockchain space. Realistically, however, the intangibles of a school have an outsized impact on everything from a student’s job prospects, to their ability to get a foot in the door of an internship, to the caliber of speaker that will spend their limited time giving a talk at any given school.  To pretend that reputation doesn’t matter, that history is insignificant, is to do a disservice to our rankings. The effect of a school’s academic reputation on our methodology, however, is dwarfed by every other category except for cost, reflecting both the recent shift away from credentialism and the greater weight that we assign to more tangible, productive metrics.  To determine an institution’s reputation score, we looked at two criteria: (a) existing, overall reputation as calculated by USNWR, THE, ARWU, and QS; and (b) reputation as determined by our own qualitative surveys, which asked both practicing academics and current students to evaluate schools. This data was split according to whether it came from a student or an academic, and quantified numerically.  Similar to last year, there are two common threads in our methodology. First, in keeping with our goal of rigor, defensibility and reproducibility, we used externally verified, quantitative data whenever such data was available, and normalized this data where appropriate to add as much nuance into our rankings as possible. When we required qualitative data, we sent out open, public, shareable surveys through all available channels and did our best not to limit participation in any way.  Second, we made every attempt to examine each data point from as many angles as possible. As is often the case, any given data point can be seen as a positive in some situations but a negative when seen through a different lens. Normalization is one tool to combat this, but so are things like common sense and a dispassionate analysis of the landscape. Data tells a story, and our goal was to let our data tell as complete a story as we could.  On rankings in general  As a final note, we’d like to echo a sentiment expressed last year and address the project of creating university rankings in a more general sense. In important ways, ordinal rankings are incredibly useful for showing very specific data or reducing large amounts of information down into a digestible format, but are also both narrow and inherently malleable.  Even small changes to the methodology can have outsized effects on the final result, as can outlier data or even researcher-introduced errors. To state that rankings are vulnerable to criticisms of subjectivity and malleability is not intended to marginalize our data or the larger project at hand; rather, we hope that by highlighting the limitations of our output, these rankings will be more useful to a greater number of individuals.  We are very willing to discuss our methodology, share data, answer questions, and address concerns. Interested readers are encouraged to contact Joe Lautzenhiser (joe.lautzenhiser [at] coindesk.com).  As a final note, it’s worth noting that we hope these rankings serve as the foundation for a living, breathing resource that goes well beyond an ordered list of schools. We have started and will continue to do this research, but we’re not naive enough to believe that we can build this particular monument alone.  But we believe this resource illuminating one small corner of the blockchain universe has tremendous value – for students seeking a more traditional path into the industry, for academics hoping to collaborate with like-minded individuals, for companies wondering where specific research is being done. As a first step, we’ve started filling out profiles for some of the top universities, but we’d eventually like to have every school represented.  Students can contribute to this by checking their school(s) and having an authorized university representative (e.g., a member of the media/communications/etc. team) contact us if any information is outdated or missing, or if their schools do not yet have a profile. Individuals can help by highlighting important research and projects, or novel approaches to blockchain education. Schools can help by examining these rankings and using them as a signal for how to improve. Ultimately, the answer is simple: devote resources to educating students, faculty, and the community about blockchain technology.

42412198,KEYN3b06rsSCg2kKkMJOjn,1633960800,"China FUD Over Bitcoin Mining Is ‘Now Moot,’ Luxor Report Says","The ”Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt” or FUD about China controlling the cryptocurrency is “now moot” as Bitcoin’s hashrate is expected to reach near all-time highs, according to a new report by Luxor Technologies.  The hashrate, one of the major profitability drivers for the crypto miners, is expected to climb closer to 185 exahashes per second in the fourth quarter, the report said. This would mark a rise of about 33% from the Oct. 7 hashrate of 139 exahashes per second, according to Glassnode.  The hashrate measures the total computational power dedicated to the Bitcoin blockchain to secure new data blocks on the distributed ledger.  Since China’s sweeping ban in July, Bitcoin’s hashrate has been recovering alongside the bitcoin currency’s price because miners outside of China saw an opportunity to reverse that country’s dominance on the sector. “Hashrate is being distributed around the globe with North America potentially emerging as the new dominant hub,” Luxor said in its report.  It added, “China’s historic ban has presented a unique opportunity, a second chance for sidelined investors who never thought it would be possible to enter the industry.”  Bitcoin mining trends all point up  Luxor is not the only firm to predict a higher hashrate for 2021. BitOoda, the digital asset fintech firm, estimated even higher hash power by year end. It raised its hashrate assumption to 198 exahashes per second from 145 exahashes previously, citing better than expected recovery in hash power after China’s mining ban.  Meanwhile, Wall Street firm B. Riley Securities predicted that hashrates for the Bitcoin network will climb to 200 exahashes per second in 2022 and 235 exahashes per second in 2023, according to a research report sent to CoinDesk by the broker.  On the flip side, mining difficulty, which is a variable gauge that automatically adjusts under the Bitcoin blockchain’s code to keep the network running smoothly, is also predicted to be higher in the fourth quarter by Luxor. “We will continue to see successive upward difficulty adjustments, though none will be as drastic as the largest positive adjustments we experienced in Q2 and Q3,” the report said. A higher difficulty is usually an earnings headwind for the miners as new bitcoin becomes harder to find for the mining rigs.  Luxor’s report also predicts prices of highest-cost ASIC miners, or computers that are solely designed to mine digital currencies, are expected to reach all-time highs in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, transaction revenue from fees will at least double and hash price will rise to its yearly high but will not break $0.50 per terahash.  So far this year, the shares of publicly traded crypto miners have been benefiting with the recovery in hashrate and bitcoin prices. A test of how much of this bullish sentiment will hold true for the miners’ stock prices will be apparent when they start reporting their earnings, later this year.  Shares of crypto miners Marathon Digital Holdings Inc. jumped 259% this year and Hut 8 Mining Corp. rose 242%, while those of Riot Blockchain Inc. climbed about 57% and Hive Blockchain Technologies Ltd. advanced 50%.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/11/china-fud-is-now-moot-for-miners-luxor-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2c208df599799be111741fde863cba3944068e90-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The bill would delay the legislation coming into effect from the currently planned Jan. 1, 2022, to the beginning of 2023.  It would also alter the law from levying a 20% tax on cryptocurrency capital gains above 2.5 million won (US$2,125) to placing a 20% tax on gains between 50 million and 300 million won ($42,000-$251,000), and a 25% tax for profits above 300 million won.  “It is not right to impose taxes first at a time when the legal definition of virtual currency is ambiguous,” the Korea Herald quoted Rep. Cho Myung-hee of the People Power Party as saying. “The intention is to ease the tax base to the level of financial investment income tax so that virtual currency investors do not suffer disadvantages.”  Lawmakers are expected to submit the bill as early as Tuesday, according to the report.

The Academy serves as a bridge for investors who want to enter the crypto space but want to learn the basics before diving headfirst.

Just like with CryptoPunks, early adopters may be in for some massive ROI. NFTs are still such a big deal Following Beeple&apos;s $69.3 million NFT sales in March, the digital art market appears to have gone into an overdrive mode. In the first half of 2021, the market for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) surged to $2.5 billion. Comparatively, the sales volume of the global NFT market was $338 million in 2020. From investors spending millions of dollars on CryptoPunks to digital artists churning out new NFTs at a record pace, one could assume that the frenzy is only just beginning. However, some industry experts have argued that the NFT flame will eventually burn out. For instance, Litecoin&apos;s Charlie Lee predicts that the value of most non-fungible tokens will eventually crash to zero as supply overwhelms demand. He wrote: &apos;The problem with NFTs is that they are non-finite tokens. There is zero cost to create an unlimited number of tokens.&apos; For some context, a non-fungible token is a crypto asset used to represent a tangible or intangible item such as an image, in-game item, real-life artwork, or even real estate.

The market also turned a blind eye toward the data showing supposedly bearish positioning by leveraged funds in the futures market.  The cryptocurrency rose to $57,000 during the early European trading hours, hitting its highest mark since mid-May, according to CoinDesk 20 data. Prices rose 13% in the week ended Sunday, registering their second straight double-digit weekly gain.  Bitcoin’s continued resilience to usually bearish macro factors could be attributed to improved prospects of the U.S. approving a futures-based bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) this month.  “The positive sentiment in BTC has been partially driven by the expectations of a potential approval for a futures-based Bitcoin ETF in the near future. Other factors contributing to the rise include continued inflows from institutional investors and SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) Chairman Gary Gensler telling Congress that the agency has no plans to ban crypto,” Coinbase Institutional said in its weekly email.  U.S. jobs data, which was released on Friday, showed nonfarm payrolls increased by 194,000 in September, compared with analysts’ average estimate of 500,000. The jobless rate, however, dropped to an 18-month low of 4.8%, keeping the Fed on track to begin unwinding the crisis-era stimulus in November and lift interest rates by mid-2022.  “Friday’s headline NFP jobs miss has done little to dampen Fed tapering/tightening expectations. For example, Dec 2023 Euro-dollar futures continue to break lower, consistent with the recent trend of the market re-pricing the U.S. interest rate curve towards Fed projections in the September Dot Plots. This is dollar bullish,” ING analysts noted in their daily market analysis.  Recent reports of the Soros Foundation gaining exposure to bitcoin and U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis’ (R.-Wyo.) disclosure of bitcoin purchases may have also added to the bullish sentiment.  The Commitments of Traders (COT) report published by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Friday revealed that hedge funds and various types of money managers that, in effect, borrow money to trade – increased their short positions from 18,000 to 22,000 in the week ended Oct. 5.  The uptick doesn’t necessarily represent outright short positioning and could have stemmed from renewed interest in a cash and carry arbitrage strategy. The method involves buying the asset on the spot market and taking a sell position in the futures market when futures are trading at a significant premium to the spot price. Futures prices converge with spot prices on the expiry day, giving a risk-free return to a carry trader.  The premium on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange-based front-month futures rose from an annualized 1.5% to nearly 12% in the seven days to Oct. 5, according to data provided by Skew.  Although bitcoin appears to be on a strong footing, some investors anticipate a temporary price pullback.

13222482,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=473415,1633937154,Can This Project Eliminate Wrapped Tokens from the DeFi Markets?,"Wrapped tokens are being widely adopted because they enable crypto traders to leverage their assets on multiple blockchains or distributed ledger technology (DLT) platforms. For instance, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), which are BTC tokens that have been &apos;wrapped&apos; into another token format, may be used on the Ethereum blockchain to conduct transactions involving smart contracts. But it might now be possible to completely eliminate these so-called Wrapped tokens from cryptocurrency trading. With this new approach, platform developers could significantly lower the time, effort, and costs associated with conducting DeFi-related transfers. By effectively removing the need to wrap tokens, transactions could become a lot more efficient, because the process of actually wrapping tokens is quite cumbersome, particularly for novice traders. Native Cryptocurrency Tradable Without Wrapping Tokens Portal&apos;s cross-chain decentralized exchange with atomic swaps has been specifically created to remove the requirement of wrapping tokens.

According to a criminal complaint filed Friday by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Jonathan and Diana Toebbe, both of Maryland, had been engaged in a conspiracy to sell information relating to the design of U.S. nuclear submarines to a foreign nation, referred to as COUNTRY1 in the complaint and supporting affidavit.  Jonathan Toebbe, an engineer assigned to the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program, held an active national security clearance through the U.S. Department of Defense, which afforded him access to sensitive information. The charge alleges the pair violated the Atomic Energy Act. The act prohibits the communication, transmission or disclosure of restricted nuclear data with the intent to injure the U.S. or to secure an advantage to any foreign nation.  The use of crypto as payment in a case with national security implications could embolden regulators and members of Congress who argue for curbs on crypto due to what they say is its prevalence in facilitating illegal activity.  On April 1, 2020, according to the affidavit, Jonathan Toebbe sent a package containing a sample of restricted data to a foreign government in a bid to establish a relationship to purchase additional sensitive information. The complaint also alleges Toebbe began corresponding via encrypted email with an individual he believed to be a representative of the foreign government.  Toebbe and his wife, Diana Toebbe, attempted to sell the restricted data on three occasions from June 8 to Oct. 9, 2021, according the the complaint.  Unbeknownst to the Toebbes, the pair met with an undercover agent on three separate occasions and handed over restricted documents, including encrypted data loaded onto SD cards concealed in a chewing gum packet and half a peanut butter sandwich. A review of the SD cards revealed they contained restricted data related to submarine nuclear reactors.  The Toebbes had received a total of $100,000 in monero before they were arrested by the FBI and the Naval Criminal Investigative Service in West Virginia on Saturday, the complaint reads.  The Toebbes will appear via the federal court in Martinsburg, W.Va., on Tuesday.
