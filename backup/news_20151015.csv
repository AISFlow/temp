42398738,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgUTD,1444941437,Prosecutors Seek 7-Year Sentence for Corrupt Silk Road DEA Agent,"Carl Force IV, the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) agent who pled guilty this summer to charges of extortion, money laundering and obstruction of justice, is set to be sentenced this Monday.  Working as part of a federal task force investigating the Silk Road, Force went rogue amidst the US government’s investigation of the now-defunct online dark market. He pled guilty in July.  The sentencing hearing is set for 2 PM PST on 19th October at the US District Court for the Northern District of California, presided by Judge Richard Seeborg.  The government has asked the court to impose a prison sentence of 87 months, or seven years and three months, as well as three years of supervised release.  According to court documents, the defense plans to ask for a sentence beneath statutory guidelines on the grounds that Force suffered from mental health issues during the period in which he committed the crimes – a basis the government disputed in its filing.  The defense filed a motion to have Force’s sentence reduced under seal on 9th October, the same day the government filed its sentencing memorandum. A representative for Bates & Garcia, the law firm representing Force, was not immediately available for comment.  Acting US Attorney Brian Stretch wrote in the government’s filing that Force ""abused the public trust and tarnished the reputation of law enforcement in the process"" and that he does not deserve leniency. He later wrote that Force’s actions were reputationally damaging for US law enforcement, stating:  ""In providing the defendant with a gun and a badge, the government entrusted him to act in a manner consistent with standards becoming a sworn law enforcement officer, namely to protect and serve the public. Conduct like Force’s undermines public confidence in law enforcement and threatens the credibility of the entire criminal justice system.""  The filing goes on to outline how the court ought to act in a bid to deter other forms of government corruption, stating that any sentence ""should send a message that this kind of conduct will be met with a harsh penalty in the form of a high-end prison sentence"".  ""Other government employees will look to what sentence Force gets as an example of what could happen to them if they were to betray the public trust,"" Stretch wrote. ""The message, accordingly, must be that this kind of conduct will result in a very lengthy custodial sentence.""

42398752,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgUgz,1444937723,Wave Brings Blockchain Trade Finance Trial to Barclays,"Blockchain-based supply chain startup Wave graduated from the TechStars FinTech accelerator this week, in the process becoming the third firm to ink a deal with UK bank Barclays, which provides non-monetary support to the startup program.  Though the deal may not be as impactful to the industry at large as Barclays's attempt to lift its banking blockade on bitcoin businesses with the help of Chainalysis, the bank's interest in Wave signals that enterprise banks may be interested in the application of the blockchain to trade finance.  Formerly called OGYDocs, Wave's product will be leveraged by Barclays Corporate Bank in a bid to help business clients reduce costs associated with supply chain management. The deal brings a high-profile client to the startup, which is toiling on similar grounds as blockchain trade finance startups including Gazebo and Skuchain.  In interview, Wave founder Gadi Ruschin suggested that this use case was one of the more potentially lucrative for the industry. Digital solutions based on the blockchain, he said, can already outperform pen-and-paper processes used today.  Ruschin told CoinDesk:  ""Blockchain is a very good solution to eliminate the pain in international trade, because you have an industry that combines all industries, because all industries are either importers or exporters at some level. You have the carrier, the bank and the customer and it's hard to find one centralized entity everyone can work with.""  Even more advantageous, Ruschin added, is that Wave's products don't threaten to remove any intermediaries.  ""We can change the industry without stepping on anyone's toes,"" he said.  Wave incorporates industry standard workflows, according to the company, replacing printed documents with versions that are stored electronically in blockchain transaction metadata.  ""The document will go between the parties on the supply chain [over the blockchain], but if they want to change ownership, the doc will be sent to the recipient, and the sender will publish a transaction that moves the document,"" Ruschin explained.  Wave is currently composed of three team members, and will base its operations in Tel Aviv following graduation from the TechStars program.  Playing with fire  Though core to its product, Ruschin said Wave will use the blockchain ""as little as possible"" in its design due to the ongoing uncertainty around how the technology is treated under law.  ""We're not putting anything on the blockchain,"" Ruschin emphasized, ""just using it to manage the ownership of each document or good in transport.""  He said Wave is developing a ""layer"" of technology that can interact with any blockchain, and that today it is being shaped on the bitcoin and litecoin testnets, versions of the protocols that include current rules but do not use real digital currencies.  Ruschin suggested that it's not yet clear which blockchain Wave will use at launch, but that it is open to using private alternatives to bitcoin due to the ""regulation problem"" facing the industry.  ""We prefer not to play with fire to be honest,"" he said.  Bill of lading  In particular, Wave will focus on integrating its product in one part of the supply chain process, seeking to take the place of traditional bills of lading (BoL), documents issued by carriers that include details about a shipment, generally the type of good, quantity and destination, and give title of the property to a certain party.  Ruschin explained carriers primarily deal with companies that have finished producing goods that need to be transported internationally, and that they in turn hand over BoLs to exporters.  ""As the exporter, once you receive the bill of lading, you add the invoice, the certificates that go along the supply chain and you put it all in an envelope and you bring it to your local bank,"" he said. ""They check it, approve it and send it to [the recipient]. They'll check all the documents, and then this is the time they trigger the receipt.""  When the recipient's bank receives the BoL, payments are then triggered to the supplier and goods are released.  ""All these processes are based on antiquated tools on the supply chain,"" Ruschin said seeking to highlight the pain point Wave's product will address. ""In any paper-based process there are problems and forgeries.""  Client acquisition  Ruschin contends the biggest challenge facing Wave is not technology, but reaching the scale it would need for its product to be successful.  As a starting point, he said the deal with Barclays would be beneficial due to its status as an international bank and position in global trade.  ""They are extremely supportive regarding everyone, but specifically about us because they are a player in this market and they have signed an agreement with us. We have already simulated the functionality of how the product would work, and they are committed to it,"" he continued, calling the firm a ""very big target customer"".  Ruschin said Wave is in talks with other, unidentified customers, and that it benefits from the increasingly positive dialogue about blockchain technology.  However, he said the team's priorities now are to build a strong local team in Israel before investing the resources needed to bring on more marquee clients, concluding:  ""We'll need to be bigger, but we're still not there.""

42398736,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgURF,1444931763,Bitcoin Node Numbers Fall After Spam Transaction 'Attack',"The number of reachable nodes has declined further following an ""attack"" that overloaded the bitcoin network.  Last week, an unknown actor sent a deluge of spam that left bitcoin's nodes – the clients that store and relay transactions – with upwards of 88,000, or 1GB worth, waiting in their collective memory pool.  As Jay Feldis from hardware node maker BitSeed explained to CoinDesk, many low-spec nodes simply could not keep up:  ""Eventually, the transaction backlog fills-up the RAM memory of the nodes. This causes the node computers to slow down dramatically or even freeze-up. If a node slows down too much, the bitcoin network considers it to be ineffective and 'offline'. My guess is that most of the offline nodes just stop functioning well enough to respond.""  By Thursday, node numbers on tracking service Bitnodes had dropped 10%.  Today, despite the memory pool returning to normal (around 4MB at press time) and Core developer Jeff Garzik implementing a 'quick fix' for operators, the total number of reachable nodes – 5,030 – remains 16% lower than before the 'attack'.  Under stress  Over the past year, the bitcoin network has been subject to a number of so-called 'stress tests' which has seen it flooded with many low-value transactions. While some have speculated over the legality of these actions, others have accused those behind them – namely, CoinWallet – of holding the network ransom.  While node operators cannot stop the tests – sending 1 million transactions in bitcoin's smallest denomination, 5,430 satoshis, could cost a spammer as little as 54 BTC (or roughly $13,000) – there are now a number of proposals that could help mitigate against them.  The 'quick fix' Garzik implemented Monday, for example, is an adjustment to each node's so-called 'Minrelaytxfee', which lets it reject transactions below a certain fee.  In the most recent release of Bitcoin Core it had been set to 0.00001 bitcoin per KB by default. This has now been increased by a factor of five to 0.00005 bitcoin per KB.  Garzik himself admits it's an ""ugly workaround"" while a more robust solution is underway, with proposals from fellow Core developers Matt Corallo, Pieter Wuille and Peter Todd currently on the table.  ""Pretty much everyone on the Bitcoin Core team is working on this, mostly by reviewing proposals, with a subset writing code,"" Todd told CoinDesk, adding:  ""The main obstacle to doing this right has been to come up with a scheme that doesn't allow attackers to use up network bandwidth at no cost; it took a number of attempts by the Core devs to come up with a scheme that didn't have vulnerabilities in it.""  However, like any change that could impact bitcoin's economics, not everyone agrees on exactly how this should play out, with Mike Hearn's Bitcoin XT client taking its own route.  Some have been skeptical that nodes' varying fees will make it difficult to price transactions – a potential problem for services which want to send transactions cheaply, for example smaller wallets.  Altruism  Node operators, unlike miners, receive no newly minted bitcoins for their contribution to the network. Many are simply hobbyists who choose to run them altruistically – to keep bitcoin big, decentralised, and thus healthy.  Thomas White, who has been running multiple nodes for the past 15 months, told CoinDesk he does so because he already pays for a server which often has capacity going spare.  ""As a big bitcoin user, I'm very aware of the importance of maintaining diversity in the network ... hosting the bitcoin blockchain there has no negative impacts for other projects on the hardware, while offering benefits to the bitcoin community,"" he said.  Although he reported that last week's sudden uptick in transactions had not affected him, others with limited hard disk space were likely to suffer.  Reddit user 'aaaaaaaarrrrrgh' was one of the node operators who took to the social network to express frustration during last week's inflated mempool. They said:  ""I've restarted my (XT) node and will try to add monitoring through Bitnodes, but otherwise, if it dies, it dies. I don't have any actual reason to be running that node, I'm doing it out of goodwill and to support the network. If it gets too annoying, I'll stop.""  While projects like Bitnodes – now rolled into 21 – are seeking to incentivise node operators with weekly payouts, it appears some operators simply won't return, with this the final straw.  Redditor 'Introshine' said they had spent $400 on hosting costs in the last year, adding: ""I had to take over 28 nodes offline that could no longer handle the mempool. Also, I ran out of funds the last few months. I'm sorry to say but they're not coming back.""",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Grace Caffyn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/10/15/bitcoin-node-numbers-fall-after-spam-transaction-attack,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/924696f455fc9cfaa755ae06600790bf378e41a8-1500x549.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398751,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgUf1,1444919541,Research: Bitcoin Price Higher Where Economic Freedoms Are Low,"New academic research has found that the price of bitcoin is higher in countries with lower degrees of economic freedom.  In his paper  , Robert Viglione, a PhD student at Darla Moore School of Business in South Carolina, notes that investors in repressed countries have bigger incentives to invest in the digital currency.  Bitcoin, he says, is a low-cost option which allows citizens of these nations to bypass their domestic financial system.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Countries with less freedom (eg capital controls and foreign exchange controls, like Argentina) have significantly higher bitcoin prices. It goes to the whole story about bitcoin having its highest values in repressive parts of the world. I think we're seeing a similar argument for Venezuelans' interest in bitcoin, as well.""  Viglione pointed out that Argentina's high bitcoin price was likely due to the data picking up the differences between the official peso exchange rate – set by the government – and the effective exchange rate used by traders buying and selling the digital currency ""on the street"".  A disaster asset  Bitcoin's decentralised and open-source nature, Viglione says, affords it the ability to trade and transmit funds across borders with few barriers or transaction costs, hence allowing the digital currency to behave as a disaster asset for people in politically unstable environments.  Countries with capital controls, unstable prices, trade barriers or little financial freedom, he says, would be prime candidates for bitcoin as investors undergo a higher degree of asset confiscation and are less likely to move funds outside of the government controlled currency and their political jurisdiction.  Viglione asserts that there is also a connection between high corporate tax rates, total tax burden and the premiums that investors are willing to pay for bitcoin.  Although he notes hat bitcoin markets are probably too small for agents to consider the digital currency a viable channel of tax avoidance, he points out that there is a negative relationship between economic freedom and tax burden.  ""Taken together, this could suggest that investors are using bitcoin as a mechanism of escaping broader repression, of which excessive taxation is a component,"" he concludes.  Bitcoin in Argentina  The findings come after the Bitcoin Potential Market Index (BMPI), an index that seeks to rank bitcoin's potential utility across 177 countries, asserted that bitcoin was most likely to succeed in Argentina.  Bitcoin's potential in the South American country made the headlines earlier this year, following the publication of an article which highlighted Argentina's volatile currency and dysfunctional banking structure and explored the digital currency's performance.  CoinDesk's research has found that bitcoin's prominence in Argentina was comparable to that of New York or San Francisco, with one interviewee saying that Argentina has between 8,000 to 20,000 bitcoin owners, amounting to approximately $70,000-$80,000 worth of over-the-counter daily trades.

42398784,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgUa6,1444912216,UK Government Highlights Benefits of Blockchain Tech,"The economic secretary to the UK government's economic and finance ministry – HM Treasury – has spoken about the benefits of digital currencies and blockchain technology.      During her speech in London yesterday about the government's technology drive, Harriet Baldwin MP said the government is working to create the right regime for digital currency businesses and to attract both overseas investors and companies to the UK.      The secretary also touched upon the government's pledge to inject £10m – announced in March – into research addressing the opportunities and challenges of digital currencies and their underlying technology as part of its larger pledge to innovation in FinTech.      According to Baldwin, the potential benefits of distributed ledgers include:      ""The potential to facilitate the fast, efficient, and secure transfer of ownership of digital assets – including bonds, shares, and other financial instruments, over the internet; and the function of digitally 'signing' and time-stamping digital assets – helping maintain records of digital documents securely and efficiency. In other words, it's all about making processes simpler and life easier.""              Baldwin's comments come after the UK Treasury announced its plans to regulate digital currencies in a report published earlier this year. The report, although largely positive about digital currencies, also noted the technology's nascent state and outlined the risks associated to cryptocurrencies.      The publication of the report followed the UK Treasury's 'Call for Information' on digital currencies in June last year, which was an attempt to decipher the risks and benefits associated with this new payment technology.      In response to this call for information, the UK's Home Office urged the government to consider creating its own digital currency, which would eradicate anonymity and pave the way for traceable transactions in a bid to reduce crime.

Speaking to Computer Weekly  at Sibos – a financial services conference held in Singapore earlier this week – John Lyons, head of strategy and commercial services for RBS's payments business, said the bank could potentially trial and launch the blockchain-based pilot in 2016.  Although Lyons reportedly declined to divulge further details about the proof-of-concept, he suggested it was ""on the fringes of payments"".  Lyons' comments come after Simon McNamara, chief administrative officer at RBS, announced the bank's work on a proof-of-concept using Ripple technology as part of a £3.5bn technological revamp.  More recently, RBS – which partnered with distributed ledger startup R3CEV – made the headlines after its technology chief said the bank had experimented with its own in-house cryptocurrency; using it to trade and settle between the group's banks.
