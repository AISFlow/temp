42427255,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK17th,1484610632,Bitcoin Tranquility Continues as Prices Remain in $800 Range,"Bitcoin prices have thus far enjoyed a day of reasonably tranquil price movements.  During today’s session, the digital currency fluctuated between $820 and $835, having fallen to as little as $820.05 at 12:15 UTC and risen to as much as $834.70 at 02:15 UTC, according to the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  The lack of volatility that bitcoin prices have seen thus far today coincides with a broader trend, as bitcoin prices have been moving between $800 and $840 since late last week. The average price is currently $828.82, BPI data shows.  Traders have been watching the markets with suspense and waiting to see what steps the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), the country's central bank, will pursue after it held meetings with major Chinese exchanges BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin earlier this month. The PBoC later pledged to keep a closer eye on the ecosystem.  Those exchanges have already gone on to revise their margin trading practices, reigning in market participants’ use of leverage to enhance their trading. Now, traders are standing back and waiting to see whether China’s central bank takes any additional action.  “We’re all waiting to see whether the PBoC does anything serious,"" said Tim Enneking, chairman of cryptocurrency hedge fund EAM.

42427248,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK17fh,1484603997,Masters-Backed Hedge Fund: Greed and Leverage Broke Bitcoin's Rally,"The bitcoin price may be stuck in the $800s for some time, a new investor note from Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment (GABI) argues.  Published today, the note finds one of the technology's more well-known hedge funds (led by ex-JP Morgan trader Daniel Masters) asserting that the market is ""temporarily broken"" after rising to near all-time highs of more than $1,100 at the start of 2017.  Overall, the firm projects that bitcoin's price is likely to continue to be volatile, and that further gains could remain elusive due to the uncertainty that it expects in the aftermath of the decline.  The note reads:  ""The extreme move and the damage no-doubt done to a number of latecomers to the market will mean that no clear trend will emerge in the very short term. We believe that we will see a series of failed rallies fueled by new players, of whom many perceive bitcoin as 'cheap' relative to recent highs.""  It continues: ""In short, the price isn’t going anywhere fast.""  That said, GABI is bullish on digital currency as an asset class long term.  Of note is that it believes there is the possibility bitcoin could see another breakout in 2017, with a ruling on a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) snapping the market out of the doldrums.  As reported last year, the SEC is expected to rule on two applications, one by the New York-based investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the other by New York-based startup SolidX, as soon as this March.  GABI goes on to suggest that its buyers accumulate bitcoin in advance of the expected rulings, and to establish long positions for when the time comes.  ""There is room for a considerable upside during the last three quarters,"" the note reads.  The findings follow a separate note from investment banking and asset management firm Needham & Co, which contends that the Winklevoss filing has a less than 25% chance of being approved.  Still, it projected that an approval would be a boon for the market, attracting as much as $300m in capital in the first week of trading alone.  Leverage to blame  Yet, the note was also critical of a bitcoin market it identified as still insufficient for the needs of an expanding investor base.  According to the note, bitcoin traders should have been aware that the market was in for what it termed an ""impending collapse"" due to what it framed as the industry's acceptance of out-of-control leveraged trading.  The note goes on to break down offerings from both BitMEX, a Hong Kong-based leveraged trading specialist and Beijing-based OKCoin, one of the world's largest bitcoin exchange firms, noting the disparities between the two models.  Overall, it pointed to a lack of standardization as a culprit, noting that exchanges offer ""divergent funding rates"" that are often based on little more than the risk tolerance of its users.  It also painted the wider market as one that was forcing investors to consider bitcoin due to the possibility of large returns.  ""Chinese investors and speculators – who are faced, as previously noted many times, with weak domestic currency, stocks, credit and commodity markets – turned to bitcoin as a non-correlated investment and speculative opportunity,"" it reads.  The note concludes:  ""Wherever you looked around the bitcoin ecosystem in early January, the message was clear. Investors had become too greedy.""  Download the full report here.

42427246,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK17Zh,1484595607,Russia's Central Bank Adds Blockchain-Friendly Firm to FinTech Working Group,"Russia’s central bank is continuing to grow its blockchain footprint, having announced the creation of a new FinTech association focused in part on studying the technology.  Officially formed  on 28th December, the group includes representatives from major Russian banks including Alfa Bank, Sberbank and VTB, among others. Payments processor Qiwi and the National System of Payment Cards (NSPK), which operates Russia's nationwide Mir charge card, are also on board.  Qiwi CEO Sergey Solonin will be the association's new chief going forwards, the firm saidhttps://investor.qiwi.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=1007852 earlier this week. Among financial companies in Russia, Qiwi has emerged as a prominent proponent of the tech.  In addition to blockchain, the Bank of Russia said it would also be investigating identification technologies and new payment system frameworks through the association.  The bank's deputy governor Olga Skorobogatova said in a statement:  “The Association’s key objectives will include the development and introduction of new technological solutions to ensure the development of the Russian financial market. It will also promote digitalisation of the Russian economy.”  The announcement is the latest signal that the Bank of Russia intends to play a leading – and visible – role in the experimentation and deployment of blockchain within the country’s financial sector.  The central bank has made no secret of its interest in the tech. Early last year, Skorobogatova said that financial institutions in Russia should prepare for wider use in the years ahead.  In recent months, the Russian central bank has been undertaking a hands-on education into the tech, unveiling a system for financial messaging dubbed “Masterchain” in October.  The Russian government, too, has been exploring blockchain concepts of its own, while its national securities depository has launched similar efforts in conjunction with other institutions.

42427251,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK17lh,1484580654,Coinbase CEO: IRS Battle Could Cost Startup $1 Million,"Digital currency exchange Coinbase has issued new comments in its ongoing dispute with the IRS.  The firm filed last week to officially respond to the so-called ""John Doe"" case instigated in November by the IRS, which is seeking to obtain three years' worth of customer records in a bid to catch tax cheats.  Specifically, Coinbase is asking that the court hold off a decision on a motion filed by one of its customers as well as the IRS summons itself, until March at the earliest.  Coinbase is also going public about how it believes the effort could cost much-needed time and resources.  Specifically, the startup said it may face as much as $1m in legal expenses as part of what it called ""an extraordinarily broad"" summons in last week's court filing. As CEO Brian Armstrong wrote in a blog post published over the weekend, this comes in spite of what he called the startup's cooperative track record when it comes to working with the IRS on its investigations.  Armstrong wrote:  ""I believe Coinbase and the IRS fundamentally want the same thing: for all US users of virtual currency to pay their taxes. And I believe our prior actions demonstrate that we are committed to making this happen. I also feel that the IRS sending us a John Doe summons on all customer accounts is not the best way for us to mutually accomplish this objective.""  Armstrong went on to advocate that the IRS use 1099-B, a tax form issued by brokers in the US that reports information on the sale of stocks and bonds, among other assets, suggesting that accepting data in this fashion could actually help the IRS in the long term.  Ultimately, he concluded, the case risks becoming a lose-lose situation for all stakeholders involved.  ""A protracted legal battle, seeking to reveal private information from people who are not evading taxes, would be bad for Coinbase, the IRS, and many US citizens,"" he wrote.

42427250,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK17jh,1484577043,Brexit Blues: Why Dublin is Turning Into a Haven for Blockchain,"In the wake of Brexit, the Republic of Ireland could become the go-to European hub for FinTech companies, and among them, its many specialists in blockchain technology.  Following the UK's leave vote, Dublin was found to be the second most attractive financial center in Europe by a PwC survey – and although London still topped the poll, uncertainty over the terms of Britain's exit from Europe make the Irish challenger more appealing by the day.  Besides a specialization in financial services, Ireland is already the European outpost for many of the most influential tech companies in the world today.  In Dublin's Grand Canal Dock area, now dubbed 'Silicon Docks', are the European headquarters of Google, Uber, Amazon, Airbnb, Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter, each employing large numbers of highly skilled technology workers who are concentrated in the region.  The evolution of the strong tech industry that exists in Ireland today can be traced back through many years of work by IDA Ireland – the governmental agency responsible solely for attracting foreign direct investment in the country, and which has worked to provide tax breaks, logistical support and other incentives to create a favourable environment for business.  Today, the fertile ground that has been created by the co-presence of the financial and technology industries is being recognized by companies based elsewhere, at least according to Keith Fingleton, chief technology advisor for IDA Ireland.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We have a number of US companies that have come here to set up R&D centers, with the research being sent back to the States in a lot of cases. And the reason they’re coming here can be summed up in one word: ecosystem.""  This ecosystem involves far more than just the big tech players – equally important is the mix of startups, university departments and research centers that occupy other crucial points on the spectrum.  As an example of the latter, Fingleton points to the Insight Centre for Data Analytics, a government-funded initiative employing hundreds of data scientists whose services are made available to local businesses.  Private sector responds  One of the many companies to respond to these incentives has been professional services provider Deloitte, which elsewhere has shown considerable interest in blockchain technology.  To date, Deloitte has so far invested London-based startup SETL, experimented with running a bitcoin ATM and developed an ethereum-based identity platform, among other projects.  Recently, the Dublin-based branch of Deloitte was named the firm's centre of excellence for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), a decision made partly on the strength of the tech ecosystem which the branch was able to access.  Lory Kehoe, a FinTech specialist at Deloitte and the EMEA blockchain lab lead, said:  ""We had some clients who wanted to explore with us, we were part of the ecosystem here in Dublin and Europe, and we'd published some thought leadership on the subject – that put us in a good place [to become the centre of excellence].""  Besides being given the internal award, interest from the international blockchain community spiked recently in the wake of a blockchain hackathon that Deloitte co-sponsored last month.  The event attracted over 150 participants and delivered €10,000 in cash prizes – with the judges giving the winning prize to a team comprised of Deloitte employees.  ""After we did the hackathon in November, and got so much global attention, that was the real ignition for us, and it really got things up and running,"" said Cillian Leonowicz, business development lead for the blockchain lab.  Following the hackathon, Deloitte was approached by the Bank of Ireland for help with assessing blockchain use cases and building a prototype based on the technology.  The outcome was a proposed solution to a challenge faced by the bank in relation to MiFID II – a new piece of European regulation of financial products and investment which, where applicable, requires that every interaction with a client must be tracked (and where the use of a distributed ledger could potentially save time and money).  And besides just benefiting from the ecosystem that already exists in Dublin, Deloitte hopes to strengthen it by building a blockchain lab, announced earlier this year and scheduled to open in January 2017.  Part of this lab will be a workspace area where up to 50 blockchain-focused developers or startup team members will be able to work, bringing one more nexus to the community and reinforcing Deloitte’s place as an influential connector.  Ecosystem growth  Kevin Loaec, managing director of blockchain consulting firm Chainsmiths – the organiser of the previously mentioned hackathon – moved to Dublin five years ago in search of somewhere that offered a buzzing tech scene and affordable living costs.  Loaec says that the high concentration of tech-minded people meant there was an underlying interest in bitcoin years before the mainstream surge, and at the same time, the small size of the city has always been conducive to forming a tight-knit scene..  ""We all follow what each other is doing, we help each other, we even work from the same coffee shops. It's like everyone is a friend in the bitcoin community here,"" said Loaec.  This friendly attitude sometimes spans bridges between otherwise rival companies: as one example, the Irish Blockchain Expert Group – an informal association of key players in the field – brings together employees of both Deloitte and PwC, usually considered strong competitors.  And as the ecosystem grows, the network effect of industry concentration becomes self-reinforcing, with Dublin attracting more and more interest from within Europe and further afield.  Where FinTech is concerned, Keith Fingleton of IDA Ireland sees a bright future:  “Financial services companies are looking at technology and data in a new light, as something that can be of real strategic importance. We know there’s a shortage of high-end developers worldwide … People are asking where can we find them, and find them at the right price point, and we say: we’re the solution.”  Dublin image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Corin Faife,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2017/01/16/brexit-blues-why-dublin-is-turning-into-a-haven-for-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/79d291636678200692c3f1685ec3181024f4d904-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

With the move, Coinfloor, one of the larger players in bitcoin's still nascent GBP market, embraces a pricing strategy that is comparable to the industry's largest, though primarily China-based exchanges, which have long withheld fees on bitcoin-denominated trades.  Speaking to CoinDesk, exchange representatives indicated that the move is designed to boost liquidity at the exchange, the largest GBP bitcoin trading platform by volume, according to data from Bitcoinity.  The exchange sees just over 630 BTC (roughly $425,000) in GBP/BTC trades daily, a figure that puts it ahead of competitors in the market including Coinbase's GDAX exchange and San Francisco-based Kraken.  Yet, Coinfloor founder Mark Lamb said that he believes Western exchanges shouldn't be afraid to follow the more ""innovative"" policies adopted globally.  Lamb told CoinDesk:  ""We also think the model is the right model for an exchange and could really fuel growth of Western bitcoin trading.""  The news is notable given that in recent weeks, BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin, the world's three largest exchanges, have been increasingly active in engaging with the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank.  So far, this interaction has seen the exchanges adjust policies on lending-based margin trading, though volume figures appear unaffected, returning to averages seen before the price neared an all-time high earlier this month.  However, Lamb stopped short of saying that the move was designed to capitalize on recent uncertainty surrounding China-based exchanges.  ""This is about growing the trading activity in the UK rather than taking away activity from other regions,"" he said.  Coinfloor said it will continue to charge for bitcoin withdrawals, as well as GBP deposits and withdrawals.

42427258,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK181h,1484568047,"'Blockchain' May Fail Banks, But Open Software Won't","Pavel Kravchenko is a decentralized systems expert, public speaker and the founder of Distributed Lab, a startup dedicated to bringing open-source blockchain to the financial sector.  In this CoinDesk opinion piece, Kravchenko offers a rebuttal to a feature penned by Ferdinando Ametrano, titled ""Why 2017 Will Prove 'Blockchain' Was a Bad Idea"", arguing that while the enterprise blockchain industry has yet to gain real traction, that doesn't mean it's failed.  We all tend to have similar assumptions about the future.  If you were to poll financial industry experts, the majority would agree that by 2050 sending payments will be as easy as WhatsApp messaging.  We all (on some level) believe payments will be digital and instant – money transfers will be free, transactions will be private, the origin of funds will be provable, and that the user will be the ultimate owner of his or her funds.  Where you'll run into arguments, is whether or not 'bitcoin' or 'blockchain technology' is the right tool to bring about this change.  Vested interests  First, a step back. When bitcoin appeared, it looked like a prototype for the future.  Bitcoin transfers were almost instant, cheap (even for microtransactions), kind of private (until you dug deeper) and transparent (until we saw Monero), and users (mostly) had sole control over their funds.  There were some who, seeing these attributes, were quick to herald that bitcoin was the path to this bright future. There was a catch, though: it was generally those who were most heavily invested in bitcoin that were saying bitcoin would be widely used.  In the process, this group assumed bank fees, regulation, wealth inequality and the risk of the failure of third parties in finance would be enough to convince the average Joe to follow suit.  But even though bitcoin has amassed an $18bn market cap and hundreds of millions people have heard about it, it is not yet in widespread use.  Edge cases  That's not to say it has failed. Rather, I would argue bitcoin is succeeding, but not where it's original supporters had hoped. If you look at this report from Chainalysis, you will see that the majority of bitcoin is used for speculation or in the 'gray economy'.  There are a few reasons for that: there is actual utility for bitcoin in the gray economy, bitcoin’s legal status is not well clarified in many countries, it still displays high volatility, and its public reputation is not that positive.  To sum it up with a generalisation, most 'bad' people don’t use bitcoin because they expect that it will be legal, and most 'good' people don’t use bitcoin because they expect it will become illegal.  On the other hand, even in the gray economies, there is huge potential for bitcoin to grow. Far from being marginalized, bitcoin could find a real role here in facilitating global commerce.  Bitcoin is a great invention, and has big potential.  It solves one important problem: the need for fast, cheap, trustless, anonymous, international money transfer, and it solves it really well.  The hype  But, bitcoin isn't for banks. Even if some of them liked bitcoin, they can't use it. In its place, then, they have focused on how decentralized systems could actually be used to handle precious assets and provide self-governance.  In 2015, tech dreamers and bitcoin enthusiasts began eyeing bank budgets, and all of a sudden, bitcoin was transformed.  These people invented the term 'blockchain payment', and instead of talking about a 'digital currency', chose the more politically acceptable term.  However, a lot of confusion resulted from the fact that 'blockchain' was understood differently by different people.  Depending on who you'd you ask, it could mean: the bitcoin blockchain, blockchain as a technology, or a specific implementation of blockchain tech.  Adding this confusion of meaning, the mainstream media was extremely careless with the terminology.  The above definition mixes up the bitcoin blockchain with the pure technology and creates overblown and incorrect expectations.  Is it any wonder why we now have groundless hype?  Pushback  Obviously, when people who understand what blockchain is hear something like ""bank Y will adopt payments on blockchain"" or ""blockchain is an immutable record of tracked changes"", they can't help but become a bit irritated.  Blockchain, defined broadly, is a mechanism for reaching consensus regarding the state of a shared ledger between an unknown number of parties who don’t trust each other. But, 'blockchain' has become a chimera sent to solve all the problems banks and governments have today.  The real irony is that private blockchain solutions haven't evolved from the advanced database technologies that have been around for some time.  But 'blockchain' has done one thing well, too – that is, show how big the market for core banking, processing and wallet software is.  Banks do realize they have to modernize their technology, and thanks to bitcoin, they understand that something can be changed soon. It's just that, in banking, there are no multiple parties that don't trust each other.  'Blockchain' doesn’t mean 'decentralization' for the financial industry, it means 'changes and innovation'.  Failed so far  Just a few companies, however, have developed some blockchain mechanisms to test how change and innovation could be achieved.  Unfortunately, these are generally more expensive than current database technologies. They might improve the efficiency of some of their processes, but on an organization level, there won't be any significant effect.  Applying standard business approaches to the 'blockchain industry' – patents, proprietary components – have been just as misguided.  For example, in the computer industry, every consumer device, regardless of the producer, is able to operate on the Internet. This is true for Linux, eTorrent, Android, bitcoin – all of which generated global change because they were open source and license free.  What the financial industry needs are products that share the same philosophy, just like the Internet needed Apache web server and the TCP/IP stack.  Not over yet  This is why I believe it's too early to declare bitcoin the winner – not every invention is used as intended.  Indeed, on further scrutiny, the comparison doesn't hold much water. (It would be like comparing C++ and WindowsXP or HTTP and WhatsApp).  The codebases powering blockchain projects will lead to crypto-based account management, synchronization between databases, proofs of integrity of history and decentralized reconciliation. Yes, you can build these things using old methods, but the presence of blockchain codebase will reduce the time needed to do so.  Even in this regard, it is clear that blockchain technology has much wider implications than databases. Because of this promise, technological research should continue in earnest on consensus protocols, cryptography, smart contracts and databases.  The inevitable evolutionary process of the market will weed out the substandard business models and only leave standing those that create real and lasting value.  Ironically, though, there will be change.  Most of the blockchain projects that survive will transform into enterprise software companies with all the related consequences (just look at Coinbase – it became a bank).  There is a high expectation of a coming revolution in the financial industry – and 'blockchain-based' products are likely to become a foundation of it.  However, I would argue we should keep our eyes on that bright future we all see ahead.  'Blockchain' may not change our lives, but it will inspire open software that will.

42427242,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK17Vh,1484565312,"SWIFT, The DTCC and How Blockchain Will Go Mainstream","Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis, corporate finance and fund management, and a member of CoinDesk's product team.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.  We caught a glimpse last week of how blockchain tech will go mainstream.  No, it won't be through killer apps developed by startups, consortia rolling out a consensus solution or breakthroughs in privacy or security. Rather, it appears it will happen when large incumbents roll out blockchains in existing processes.  That may not sound exciting, but it is a big deal (or at least, as big as we're going to get in the short term).  But, we need to remember that financial institutions are not generally known for their flamboyance or risk taking. And we need to bear in mind that only the incumbents have the reach to test the technology at scale in the short term.  Two events indicate that this process has already begun:  The DTCC's announcement that it will migrate the post-trade processing of credit derivatives to a DLT system in 2018  SWIFT's reveal it is launching a proof-of-concept to test the blockchain’s impact on real-time reconciliation of international accounts.  Diving in  On the surface, the two announcements have remarkable similarities:  They both come from structural giants owned by their members or users, ensuring buy-in from most of the main sector participants.  Both instigators dominate their respective activities. The DTCC is the largest central securities depository (CSD) in the world, and it provides processing services for about 98% of all credit default swaps. SWIFT, on the other hand, is the world's largest electronic payment messaging system, used by more than 11,000 financial institutions.  Both SWIFT and DTCC are founding members of blockchain consortium Hyperledger, which indicates an interest in experimentation and collaboration.  Both announcements may seem bold and sweeping, but they are actually exercises in caution.  This last point merits further consideration, as it is likely to be a key factor for success:  Both DTCC and SWIFT plan to combine the new technology with existing systems. Even after the new platform goes live in 2018, DTCC will continue to run its old one in parallel. SWIFT plans to combine the blockchain under trial with its current identity protocol and public key infrastructure.  Both plan to make adoption optional. This should reassure those members and users who prefer a ""wait-and-see"" approach, and allows for gradual roll-out across their respective sectors.  In neither case are we looking at new, innovative services. We're looking at potential improvements on current processes.  In both cases, blockchain technology will not initially be used for actual settlement or payments, to mitigate systemic risk. The focus will be on the handling and reconciliation of information, not money.  Slow and steady  While blockchain enthusiasts may be disappointed at the limited scope of the applications, we need to bear in mind that for the technology to have significant real-world impact, it needs broad implementation in a conservative industry.  Also, it needs regulators to be comfortable with the pace of change.  Whichever project becomes a reality first, a large portion of the financial sector will be using blockchain technology to simplify processes and reduce costs.
