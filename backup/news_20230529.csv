So far, Chinese coins have led the pack when it comes to gains, so here are three of the most popular Chinese tokens likely to rally if the bullish trend continues. Neo (NEO) Neo (NEO) has long been a favorite of Chinese investors and is often fondly referred to as the “Chinese Ethereum.” The cryptocurrency is one of the leading coins from the region so it is no surprise to see that it has moved back into the spotlight as retail traders are set to begin trading cryptocurrencies in Hong Kong on June 1. Related Reading: Bullish Case For Litecoin Grows Stronger As LTC Halving Draws Close The past week has already been profitable for its investors with 13.95% gains already recorded on the weekly chart. In the past day as well, the digital asset has seen gains of 3.34%, but there is still a lot of ground to cover before trading goes live. So NEO could present as a good choice for investors looking to take advantage of the new bull rally being led by Chinese investors. NEO price recovers above $11 | Source: NEOUSD on TradingView.com Conflux (CFX) Conflux (CFX) is one of the top Chinese coins for investors to keep an eye on during this time. Conflux is a blockchain company based in China and its native token CFX has seen much success this year. However, the drawdown in the price of the coin in the last month has not deterred investors and as the Chinese narrative gains ground, the token has grown as well. Just like NEO, the last week has been a good one for CFX whose price has risen 9.96% to bring its price above $0.32 once more. The coin’s trading volume also crossed $117 million in a 24-hour period, indicating that investors are always investing in this token ahead of the anticipated June 1 date. VeChain (VET) VeChain (VET) is one of the oldest blockchains in the space which was founded in 2015, the same year as Ethereum. And although VeChain hasn’t grown as much as Ethereum, it hasn’t been stagnant either and has become one of the foremost Chinese coins, making it a perfect candidate for those looking to take advantage of the present narrative. Related Reading: Elon Musk Reveals Reason Behind Dogecoin Investment, But Why Is DOGE Down? Although VET hasn’t performed as well as the others on this list, it is up nonetheless with 5.58% gains in the last week. It is also seeing a modest upside of 1.67% on the 24-hour chart, but the promise of more gains remains vast as the last two days leading up to June 1 could see these coins heat up very fast. If the trend continues, then VET could be looking at breaking the $0.03 resistance before the week is over. China And Crypto China banned cryptocurrencies in 2021 when the price of Bitcoin had rallied to $60,000. This move triggered a crash in the market, from which Bitcoin recovered not too long after, but it left Chinese investors unable to adequately participate in a market that they had previously dominated. That is, until now that Hong Kong has made a move. Related Reading: When Is A Token Coming For Coinbase’s Base L2? Here’s What The Roadmap Says The country passed a new law that would allow crypto exchanges to offer services to investors, making it possible for them to participate in the market once more. This gives investors in China an avenue to trade cryptocurrencies without being worried about breaking the law. It is set to go into effect on June 1, less than three days from now. As this date draws closer, a study by Forex Suggest has shown that Hong Kong is the most crypto-ready country in the world. However, it remains to see how this event will play out in the crypto market.

Large Buyer’s Purchase May Signal Yes","Bitcoin is finally seeing some green after trading at a loss over the past two weeks. The cryptocurrency continues to trade within a tight range, but activity in the options market could hint at a potential run toward new highs. Related Reading: No All-Time High For Bitcoin In 2023, Former BitMEX Head Arthur Hayes Predicts As of this writing, Bitcoin (BTC) trades at $27,900 with a 2.5% profit in the last 24 hours. Over the last week, the cryptocurrency has seen twice the profits recording a 4.4% performance. Other cryptocurrencies in the top 10 by market cap are experiencing similar momentum. Bitcoin Options Hint At Fresh Rally? Data from crypto options trading platform Deribit indicates a drop in Implied Volatility (IV). This metric measures the expectation of future price movements by market participants. IV has been trading sideways over the past month, with a tendency to the downside. Deribit claims that growing uncertainty in the crypto market and the macroeconomic landscape is fueling the current dynamic on this metric, which translates into slow price action for BTC and crypto. As the price of Bitcoin retraces, option buyers have been selling their contracts. When the opposite happens, and BTC sees an uptick, options sellers dump their contracts. This dynamic has put “constant selling pressure” on the IV and contributed to suppressing the BTC spot sector. However, the upcoming U.S. debt ceiling, the date this country could default on its national financial commitments, could change the status quo. The narrative around this event hints at a further appreciation for BTC and risk-on assets. Today, equities and crypto rallied as key political factions in the North American country reached a tentative agreement that could avert a crisis across the financial world. Over the weekend and into today’s development, Deribit noted that maturity for BTC options turned profitable. The exchange also saw aggressive calls buying as the landscape signals profits for the cryptocurrency and prices return north of $27,000. This large player bought calls (buy orders), betting that BTC could hit $34,000 somewhere in July/August 2023, as seen on the chart below.

13014839,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=535589,1685392232,The End of Tether? Why A Structural Shift In The Market Spells Trouble For USDT,"Tether (USDT) is the largest stablecoin in the market, with a market capitalization of over $86 billion as of May 2023. Despite the concerns about the current state of the cryptocurrency market, Tether has continued to dominate the stablecoin space, with its supply growing significantly since the beginning of 2023. However, there are signs that new competitors may challenge its dominance in the future. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Hopes Still Alive, If This Metric Is To Go By USDT’s Reign Over? According to the researcher and founder of DeFiance Capital, ArthurOx, one factor that may limit Tether’s growth is the emergence of new stablecoins. As investors become more concerned about the risks associated with Tether, they are likely to seek alternatives that offer greater transparency and accountability. For example, USDC (USD Coin) is a stablecoin fully backed by US dollars held in reserve by regulated financial institutions, and its supply has been growing rapidly in recent years. Another factor that may limit Tether’s growth is the emergence of decentralized stablecoins. These stablecoins are built on blockchain platforms, offering a decentralized alternative to centralized stablecoins like Tether. Decentralized stablecoins eliminate the need for a central authority to manage the reserves, as the reserves are held in smart contracts on the blockchain. This offers high transparency and security and eliminates the risk of a central authority mismanaging the reserves or engaging in fraudulent activities. One example of a decentralized stablecoin is DAI, built on the Ethereum blockchain. DAI is backed by a basket of cryptocurrencies held in smart contracts on the blockchain. This ensures that the value of DAI remains stable while offering high transparency and security. In addition to these factors, there are also regulatory risks associated with Tether. The stablecoin has come under scrutiny from regulators in the US and other countries, with some calling for greater transparency and oversight. If regulators impose stricter regulations on Tether, this could limit its growth and open up opportunities for other stablecoins to gain market share. Tether And USDC Show Resilience Amid US Debt Ceiling Drama According to a recent report by Kaiko, USDT and USDC have shown little volatility amid the ongoing drama surrounding the US debt ceiling. Despite concerns over a potential US default, USDT and USDC saw little to no price movement over the past two weeks. This suggests that the markets did not view default as the base case scenario and that investors remained confident in the stability of these stablecoins. Interestingly, USDT and USDC have increasingly been trading in tandem during periods of market stress. For example, when Binance temporarily halted withdrawals for Bitcoin (BTC) earlier this month due to network congestion issues, both stablecoins rose above $1, as seen in the chart above. This suggests that USDC may have gained some safe-haven appeal as U.S. banking troubles eased. The resilience of USDT and USDC during the debt ceiling drama reflects a wider trend in the cryptocurrency market, where stablecoins have become an increasingly popular way for investors to hedge against volatility. Related Reading: Bearish Sentiment Hits EOS As Bulls Lose Control, What Lies Ahead? These developments underscore the growing importance of stablecoins in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As more investors seek to hedge against market volatility and regulatory uncertainty, the demand for stablecoins will likely grow. Moreover, the emergence of new decentralized finance (DeFi) applications that require stablecoins as a means of exchange and collateral is also fueling demand.

13013304,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=535573,1685386803,"Bearish Sentiment Hits EOS As Bulls Lose Control, What Lies Ahead?","EOS Network, a popular open-source blockchain platform prioritizing high performance and security, has recently witnessed a sharp price decline. The asset exhibits bearish sentiment in the 30-Day timeframe. Related Reading: The Best Decision Is To ‘Buy Bitcoin (BTC),’ Robert Kiyosaki Urges The EOS price is down by 14.19% in its one-month data from CoinMarketCap. This suggests that the bears have controlled the market since the last 30 days trading session. This shift in market sentiment raises questions about what lies ahead for EOS. EOS Faces High Bearish Momentum, Further Price Decline, or Potential Reversal? The bearish sentiment and the loss of control by the bulls have had a noticeable effect on EOS’s price. The cryptocurrency has experienced a downward trend, with declining trading volumes and increased selling pressure. Notably, the 24-hour trading volume is declining by 13.29% today, May 29, 2023, and its market cap is down by 1.32%. As of the time of writing, the price of EOS is down by 1.28%, at $0.89. This trend reflects a shift in market dynamics as investors become more cautious and start to sell their EOS holdings. Despite the prevailing bearish sentiment, potential catalysts could alter the trajectory for EOS. On May 26, the EOS network shared potential bullish news about its partnership with Hypha DAO and an initiative dubbed Beta Program. EOS network claims that the Beta program will offer a range of pre-configured templates designed to meet different firms’ needs and objectives. Generally, this news may lead to a positive market impact on the EOS price and market sentiment. EOS’s positive development and partnership can attract new buyers and increase demand, increasing prices. Also, Fear of Missing Out (FOMO), a psychological phenomenon, can create a buying frenzy and drive the price even higher quickly. EOS Price Formed Double Bottom Pattern In that sense, the EOS/USDT has formed a double-bottom chart pattern, suggesting a potential uptrend movement soon. The double bottom pattern is a bullish reversal pattern that typically forms after a prolonged asset price decline. Confirming the double bottom pattern occurs when the asset’s price breaks above the resistance level formed by the peak between the two bottoms. This breakout confirms the reversal signal and suggests a higher probability of an upcoming uptrend. Related Reading: JPMorgan Predicts Bitcoin (BTC) To Revisit $45,000, Here’s Why EOS has an important resistance level at $0.931, which represents a significant blockage for possible bullish movement. Bollinger Bands and MACD Signal Potential Trend Reversal The asset is currently oscillating between the upper band and middle band of the Bollinger Band indicator. This suggests an increase in the buying pressure and a rising bullish momentum. In addition, the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is currently above its signal line, suggesting bullish momentum. This indicates that the buyers are gradually taking over the market, and there might be a potential trend reversal soon. As seen in the chart above, the histogram is above zero and has strong green bars, further confirming the bullish sentiment in the market.

13012244,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=535510,1685383245,"Bitcoin Rally Hopes Still Alive, If This Metric Is To Go By","If the historical pattern in this on-chain indicator is anything to go by, hopes for the continuation of the Bitcoin rally may still be alive. Bitcoin SOPR Ratio Has Been Going Up In Recent Weeks As an analyst in a CryptoQuant post pointed out, the SOPR ratio has been above 1 recently. The “Spent Output Profit Ratio” (SOPR) indicates whether the investors in the Bitcoin market are selling their coins at a profit or a loss right now. When the value of this metric is above 1, it means the average holder in the sector is currently moving their coins at a loss. On the other hand, values below this threshold imply the market is realizing a net profit at the moment. The BTC sector is generally divided into two main holder groups: the “short-term holders” (STHs) and the “long-term holders” (LTHs). The former cohort includes all investors that acquired their coins within the last 155 days, while the latter group includes those who bought before this cutoff. In the context of the current discussion, the relevant indicator is not the SOPR itself but the “SOPR ratio.” This indicator measures the ratio between the SOPR, specifically for the LTHs and the STHs. Related Reading: Will This Political Deal In The US Save Bitcoin and Crypto? Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 30-day simple moving average (SMA) Bitcoin SOPR ratio throughout the history of the asset: Looks like the value of the metric has been going up in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the quant has marked the pattern that the 30-day SMA Bitcoin SOPR ratio seems to have followed during the past cycles of the cryptocurrency. Whenever the SOPR ratio is below 1, the LTHs realize lower profits relative to the STHs. Historically, this has usually been observed inside bear markets. The bear market bottom formations in the asset price have always occurred when the indicator has plunged deep below this mark and hit a value of about 0.5. Bullish periods followed with a surge in the metric back above the 1 level. Such a breakout implies a shift in the market dynamics, as the LTHs are harvesting a higher profit than the STHs during periods like these. During the rally in the last few months, the 30-day SMA Bitcoin SOPR ratio has again managed to break above the 1 mark, suggesting that the shift towards a bull market may have occurred. Related Reading: Bitcoin Shows Recovery: Did This Historical Line Act As Support Again? The metric is still firmly above this level, despite the recent struggle that the coin has seen. The analyst believes this is a sign that the bulls continue to dominate the market. From the chart, it’s also visible that the present values of the SOPR ratio are nowhere near as high as what was observed during past rallies, including the April 2019 rally, which may hint that the rally has some potential to go before the top. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $27,900, up 4% in the last week.

13011167,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=535564,1685379639,Get Rich Or Get Rugged? RUGME’s Unique Liquidity Mechanism Sparks Controversy,"A new token has emerged in the cryptocurrency world, causing a stir among investors. Rug Me (RUGME) has a unique liquidity mechanism that is daring investors to try to “rug” the contract. According to the DeFi researcher Tsubasa, this high-stakes competition has a big brain game that challenges the most intelligent investors to solve a complex puzzle, promising high rewards. However, there is a catch. If someone is smart enough to solve the puzzle, they can rug the liquidity and take 20% of the pool. “Rugging” the liquidity means that someone can pull out a significant amount of funds from the pool and cause the token’s value to drop rapidly. This can result in significant losses for investors who hold the token. Related Reading: Polkadot Experiences Correction After Reaching $5.54: What’s Next In Store? RUGME, Big Brain Game, Or Big Risk? RUGME has a 1 trillion supply, with 100% used as liquidity. The token has a 10% transfer and buy fee, with no selling fee. All fees are disbursed to holders, who can claim them from the contract. When the liquidity is rug-pulled, 20% goes to the rugger, and 80% is refunded to the holders. Furthermore, Tsubasa believes investing in Rug Me is not for the faint. The token is high-risk and high-reward, with the potential for significant loss. But Rug Me (RUGME) offers a unique and exciting investment opportunity for investors willing to take risks. Investors are flocking to RUGME, with 15 ETH already in the liquidity pool. The token has a 100e curve, meaning that any buy below 100e will get the same price, with no first-comer advantage. The token has a 10% transfer and buy fee, with all fees disbursed to holders who can claim from the contract. This mechanism incentivizes holding the token, as holders can earn fees every time the token is transferred or bought. Investors can enter the market at the same price point as others below 100e, eliminating the issue of joining later to this market. The earlier investors are, the more fees they earn from buys. However, after 100e, the price will start moving, and if people keep buying, the price could skyrocket. But the risk of rug-pulling is ever-present, and investors need to know the potential for loss. Is The Memecoin Craze Losing Steam?

13010103,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=535556,1685376058,Bullish Run for Injective (INJ): Will the Momentum Continue?,"The Injective (INJ) price has experienced an uptrend, resulting in price increases since yesterday, May 28. This trend indicates a positive sentiment among investors, with more buyers entering the market and increasing prices. Meanwhile, the uncertainty around the price of the general crypto market has caused speculations about whether this momentum will continue. Assessing The Potential For Sustained Momentum The bullish sentiment in the INJ market has affected its price positively, resulting in an increase of 8.78% in the last 24 hours. Also, the buyers have maintained this momentum, resulting in a surge of 8.56% in the 7-day trading period. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Inflows Mostly Coming From Loss Holders, Weak Hands Exiting? The asset’s current price sits at $7.41 as of the time of writing based on CoinMarketCap data. The assets’ 24-hour trading volume and total market cap show positive market participation with an increase of 200.36% and 9%, respectively. INJ has maintained the uptrend movement by forming higher highs and lows. This formation indicates that INJ’s price is under bullish control, and the demand is growing rapidly. Also, the asset trades above the trendline, which may be considered a trendline support for investors and traders. This positive sentiment may attract more investors and increase prices. Recent Bullish Fundamentals Recently, there have been many partnerships and initiatives around the Injective ecosystem. This has resulted in bullish sentiment and price gains for INJ. On May 24, Injective announced the launch of the first IBN-enabled SVM Rollup with their partnership, Eclipse, on their page. This initiative will enable Solana developers seamlessly interact and build with Injective and the broader Cosmos universe. The INJ team made this announcement on May 13, 2023, stating that anyone interacting with dApps built on INJ or L1 Chain may receive an NFT. The surprise NFT announcement boosted the bullish momentum in the market. Bollinger Bands & MACD Signals Bullish Momentum The asset is currently trading above the upper band of the Bollinger Bands Indicator. This suggests a bullish movement and a potential buy signal for investors and traders. It is important to note that an asset above the upper band implies that the price has moved to an extreme or overbought level. In addition, the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is currently above the signal line suggesting a bullish sentiment. This indicates that the buying pressure outweighs the selling pressure. The INJ price trades above the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), indicating bullish sentiment. The price above both SMAs implies that the asset is under bullish pressure and a potential long-term bullish trend.

Hayes believes that Bitcoin’s anticipated climb to an all-time high of $70,000 is unlikely to materialize this year, dampening the hopes of investors and traders. However, he points to a potentially bullish turn in 2024, driven by a significant event that could shape the market’s trajectory. Bitcoin Rise To $70,000 To Be Delayed During an episode of the ‘What Bitcoin Did’ podcast, Hayes shared his perspective on Bitcoin’s price trajectory. He indicated that breaching the $70,000 milestone is not expected to occur in 2023. Related Reading: The Best Decision Is To ‘Buy Bitcoin (BTC),’ Robert Kiyosaki Urges Instead, Hayes suggests that next year’s anticipated halving event will play a crucial role in determining the market’s direction. While the delay may disappoint some, he remains optimistic about a potential breakthrough in the near future. The former head of BitMEX believes that the upcoming 2024 halving, an event that slashes Bitcoin’s block reward in half, will be a pivotal moment for the market. He suggests that crossing the $70,000 barrier will likely happen during that time. However, his long-term forecast raises concerns about an impending “blow-off top” in 2025 or 2026, potentially signaling a significant societal event or turmoil which he calls “Armageddon.” Hayes attributes this potential turmoil to factors such as excessive money printing and growing global discontent. Hayes noted: We have got this halving next year, 2024. I think that’s gonna be a good year. I don’t think we get up to $70,000 this year. Next year is when we cross that barrier and then we get the blow-off top 2025, 2026. And then it’s Armageddon. BTC Latest Price Action Meanwhile, Bitcoin has shown a possible brewing uptick in the past week. The largest crypto asset by market capitalization has surged 4.3% in the past week. Over the past 24 hours, BTC has seen a 2.8% gain. At the time of writing, Bitcoin currently trades at $27,925 after slightly trading above $28,000 on Sunday. Bitcoin’s trading volume has surged from $5 billion last Monday to $12 billion in the past 24 hours indicating a possible upward momentum. In addition, the asset’s market capitalization has also seen a more than $20 billion gain in the past 7 days. However, according to Hayes, the increased practice of quantitative easing, which involves injecting more money into the economy, has created a volatile situation that could explode in the third and fourth quarters of this year. Related Reading: JPMorgan Predicts Bitcoin (BTC) To Revisit $45,000, Here’s Why He warns of mounting geopolitical tensions and a lack of trust, asserting that these factors form a “tinderbox” that could trigger a period of immense volatility for Bitcoin.

13008007,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=535518,1685369067,Polkadot Experiences Correction After Reaching $5.54: What’s Next In Store?,"Yesterday, Polkadot (DOT) reached its weekly high at $5.54 but subsequently started a corrective phase. In the past 24 hours, DOT has managed to retain 1.8% of its overall gains during that period. On the weekly chart, DOT exhibited a 3% price increase. However, the technical analysis suggests that bears currently have the upper hand, with buying strength and demand remaining low. Despite this, if Bitcoin continues its upward movement toward the $28,000 level, several altcoins, including DOT, may also experience positive price action. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bounces Off $0.070 Mark, Awaits Breakthrough of Crucial Hurdle On the flip side, if sellers dominate, DOT could break below its crucial support level, strengthening the bearish sentiment in the upcoming trading sessions. The decline in the DOT market capitalization further indicates the prevailing low buying strength at the present moment. Polkadot Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, DOT was trading at $5.47. Following a rejection at the $5.54 level, the altcoin has experienced a retracement on its chart. The overhead resistance for DOT is currently positioned at $5.58. If the altcoin manages to surpass this resistance level, it could potentially reach $5.80. Despite the price correction, DOT has thus far maintained a position above the crucial support level of $5.40. However, if sellers gain momentum, the price may drop below the vital support level of $5.40 and trade around $5.30. The trading volume of DOT in the previous session was bearish, indicating a decline in demand driven by the bears on the daily chart. Technical Analysis Throughout the month of May, DOT has experienced minimal demand on its chart. Although the Relative Strength Index (RSI) displayed signs of recovery initially, the depreciation of DOT led to a decrease in demand. This suggests that buying strength did not enter the positive zone. Furthermore, the DOT price moved below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, indicating that sellers have been driving the price momentum in the market. If there is a slight increase in demand in the upcoming trading sessions, DOT may attempt to trade above the 20-SMA line, providing an opportunity for the bulls to regain control over the price. Although demand for Polkadot has declined, the chart still displays buy signals, suggesting the potential for a price increase. These buy signals are accompanied by an increase in demand, indicating a positive outlook. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, which reflects price momentum and trend changes, shows green histograms tied to buy signals. Related Reading: Floki Inu: Does Meme Coin Have What It Takes To Re-Enter Top 100 Spot?

Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Cost Basis May Still Be Active As Support According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the BTC price approached the cost basis of the short-term holders recently. The relevant indicator here is the “realized price,” which is a metric derived from the “realized cap.” The realized cap refers to a capitalization model for Bitcoin that says that the value of each coin in the circulating supply is not the current spot price, but the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. In this way, the model accounts for the price at which each investor acquired their coins. That is, their “cost basis.” When the realized cap is divided by the number of coins in circulation (to find a sort of average value), the aforementioned realized price emerges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Inflows Mostly Coming From Loss Holders, Weak Hands Exiting? This realized price signifies the average value at which each holder in the market bought their coins. The metric can also be defined for only partial segments of the market, like the “short-term holders” (STHs), in which case, the indicator will tell us about the average cost basis among this group only. The STHs are all those investors who bought their coins less than 155 days ago. The BTC holders outside this group are termed the “long-term holders” (LTHs). Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin realized price for the STHs over the past couple of years: The value of the metric seems to have been climbing in recent days | Source: Glassnode on Twitter In the above graph, Glassnode has marked the various instances where the Bitcoin STH realized price has apparently interacted with the spot price of the asset. Back when the 2021 bull run topped out in November, the cryptocurrency’s value dropped below this indicator, signaling a change of trend. From this point on, as the bear market took over, the STH cost basis started providing resistance to the asset. Back in January of this year, though, the price finally managed to break through this resistance as the rally began to take place. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Push BTC Back Up To $28K Amid Surging Address Activity This break lead to another change in the wider trend, as the line seemingly turned into support for the asset. However, this isn’t an unusual pattern, as bullish periods have historically observed the metric helping the price. Recently, Bitcoin found some struggle, as the price plunged towards the $26,000 level. The consolidation near this level meant that the price was fast approaching the STH realized price, which was slowly going up. When Glassnode posted the chart yesterday, it described this current state as a “decision point” for the market. According to the analytics firm, a successful retest here would be a sign of strength in the bullish trend, while failure would imply weakness. Over the past day, Bitcoin has enjoyed a rebound, with the price briefly breaking above the $28,000 level. But it may perhaps not be a coincidence that the uplift has come right as the price was nearing a retest of this historical level. Naturally, a sustained move away from the STH realized price now would confirm that the level is still active as support, a sign that would be positive for the rally’s sustainability. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $27,900, up 4% in the last week.

42410578,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdfcD6,1685362818,Dogecoin Chart Pattern Suggests Volatility Explosion Ahead,"Dogecoin (DOGE), the meme cryptocurrency known for its rapid price moves, has been unusually calm this year, underperforming market leaders bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) by a significant margin.  One technical analysis indicator called Bollinger bandwidth suggests it may be the calm before the storm.  The indicator illustrates periods of varying volatility relative to the price gyrations and is calculated by dividing the spread between the Bollinger bands by the 20-day simple moving average (SMA) of the cryptocurrency's price. Bollinger bands are volatility lines placed two standard deviations above and below the 20-day SMA average of prices.  Periods of rising volatility are marked by a sharp increase in the distance between the two bands and the widening of the bandwidth. Conversely, the two bands contract and the width narrows or declines during a volatility lull.  An usually wide or high bandwidth indicates the ongoing bullish/bearish trend is nearing an end. Meanwhile, an unusually low bandwidth suggests ""the market may be about to initiate a pronounced move in either direction, as Fidelity  When the bandwidth is too high, it's a sign the current bullish/bearish trend may be ending. Meanwhile, an unusually low bandwidth suggests the market may be about to exit a consolidation pattern with a pronounced move in either direction, as Fidelity's explainer says.  Dogecoin's daily chart shows the bands have recently tightened, pushing the bandwidth down to 0.06, the lowest since February 2019, according to TradingView.  So, dogecoin could soon see a volatility explosion in line with the bandwidth's tendency to alternate between expansion and contraction. Note that the impending volatility explosion is agnostic to price direction, meaning the big move can be bearish or bullish.  At press time, dogecoin traded near $0.073. The world's leading meme cryptocurrency, currently valued at $10.22 billion, has risen just 3% this year.

13004808,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=535490,1685358022,"Dogecoin Bounces Off $0.070 Mark, Awaits Breakthrough of Crucial Hurdle","In recent trading sessions, the price of Dogecoin has experienced an upward trend, surpassing a significant resistance level. Over the past 24 hours, DOGE recorded a 1.2% increase, and within the last week, the coin appreciated by 2%. The technical analysis suggests the possibility of upcoming bullish momentum as buying strength attempts to recover. However, demand and accumulation indicators have not yet entered the positive zone. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Push BTC Back Up To $28K Amid Surging Address Activity To establish bullish control in subsequent sessions, DOGE must surpass a crucial resistance level. The broader market’s recovery, including Bitcoin’s rise above $27,500, may also contribute to the DOGE upward price movement. The upcoming trading sessions will be crucial in determining whether bulls or bears will dictate the price action. However, the decline in the Dogecoin market capitalization indicates current seller dominance over the asset. Dogecoin Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, DOGE was trading at $0.073 and has shown gradual gains since surpassing the $0.070 resistance line. However, a potential price correction could occur if it fails to breach its overhead resistance. The immediate resistance level for DOGE is set at $0.075. Surpassing this level would likely trigger a rally toward the $0.078 mark, strengthening the position of the bulls. Conversely, if DOGE fails to hold its current price level, it may decline to $0.071 and potentially drop below $0.070. The recent trading session indicated weak buying strength, as the amount of Dogecoin traded was in the red. Technical Analysis Throughout May and even April, Dogecoin faced challenges in attracting positive demand. At the current moment, buying strength remains low despite the ongoing recovery. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates that buyers still lack confidence in the asset, as it is below the half-line. Furthermore, the DOGE price has fallen below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, indicating that sellers are driving the price momentum in the market. However, if Dogecoin manages to surpass the $0.070 price level, it will move above the 20-SMA line, indicating increased demand and potentially reversing the current trend. On the one-day chart, DOGE exhibited diminishing buy signals in line with other technical indicators. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which indicates price momentum and trend reversal, showed declining green histograms associated with buy signals. Additionally, the Bollinger Bands, which reflect price volatility and fluctuation, displayed significant narrowing. This suggests that DOGE may experience heightened price volatility and fluctuations in the upcoming trading sessions.

The SEC, in a lawsuit filed in January to a New York court, targeted Gemini's yield-bearing product Earn, an unregistered offering through which the regulator alleged the two entities ""raised billions of dollars’ worth of crypto assets from hundreds of thousands of investors.""  ""As alleged in the complaint, Genesis then exercised its discretion in how to use investors’ crypto assets to generate revenue and pay interest to Gemini Earn investors,"" the SEC said in its complaint. Genesis, like CoinDesk, is owned by the Digital Currency Group (DCG).  While with the Earn program ""the borrower and lender could choose to engage in subsequent transactions,"" Gemini said in Friday's filings that ""it did not itself require any lending or borrowing by any party, and there was no way for a lender to transfer or assign it without the affirmative consent of all parties.""  Gemini further alleged the SEC's treatment of the tri-party Master Digital Asset Loan Agreement (MDALA) contract between Genesis, Gemini and Earn users as an unregistered security ""has no basis in law or fact.""  The SEC failed to ""adequately plead"" MDALA was a security and failed ""to make non-conclusory allegations that the MDALA was sold to anyone, or that any party offered to sell it,"" the document supporting a motion to dismiss said.  In its original complaint, the SEC noted Genesis held around $900 million in assets belonging to some 340,000 Gemini Earn investors, when it froze withdrawals from the platform in November shortly before filing for bankruptcy protection in the U.S.  “We allege that Genesis and Gemini offered unregistered securities to the public, bypassing disclosure requirements designed to protect investors,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said at the time.

42410581,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdfcJi,1685353973,Bitcoin's Short-Term Holders Are Again Selling at Profit,"Bitcoin's (BTC) near-term outlook appears constructive as blockchain data show short-term holders of the cryptocurrency are moving coins at a profit.  The seven-day moving average of the short-term holder's (STH) spent output profit ratio (SOPR) has recently moved back above 1, according to blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.  ""After a brief stint of coins moving at a loss, STH-SOPR is now back above 1,"" analysts at Blockware Solutions said in a weekly newsletter. ""This is bullish for near-term price action as it shows capitulation from short-term holders.""  The short-term holder SOPR of more than 1 means the average short-term holder in the market is selling coins at a profit. A reading below 1 is considered a sign of capitulation, while a reading of 1 indicates the average short-term holder is just breaking even.  The SOPR is calculated by dividing the realized dollar value of a spent output (UTXO) by the value at output creation to reflect the degree of realized profit for all coins moved on-chain. The short-term holder SOPR is focused on all wallets that have held onto their coins for less than 155 days.  The STH SOPR has historically stayed above 1 during bull markets. That's understandable, as rallies allow short-term holders – mostly new entrants, active traders or weak hands – to liquidate their holdings at a price higher than the acquisition cost.  Besides, the area around 1 tends to act as a support level during bull runs, as holders, expecting continued price rallies, see their cost basis as a profitable buying opportunity. On the flip side, level 1 acts as resistance during bearish trends.  The STH SOPR crossed above 1 in January, signaling a bullish trend reversal and has since tested the support twice. Bitcoin has rallied over 68% this year, according to CoinDesk data. At press time, the cryptocurrency was trading near $27,900, having put in a high of $28,441 during the overnight trade, CoinDesk data show.

Its charismatic Shiba Inu mascot and an active community on social media platforms quickly attracted a dedicated following. Floki Inu’s journey, however, has not been without its fair share of ups and downs. As the crypto market is known for its volatility, the question arises: Can Floki Inu rally strong enough to regain its coveted spot among the top 100 cryptocurrencies? Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Push BTC Back Up To $28K Level Amid Surging Address Activity Floki Inu Market Cap And Growth Analysis Floki Inu (FLOKI), despite previously achieving a significant rally that propelled it into the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, has recently lost its position among the elite. Currently, FLOKI holds the 121st spot with a market capitalization of $332,037,915. Source: Coingecko Within the vast cryptocurrency market, Floki Inu (FLOKI) is currently priced at a modest $0.00003367, as per CoinGecko. Over the past 24 hours, the token experienced a slight 2.8% increase. However, it managed to tally a decent 8.8% over the past seven days. The coin is down 6.7% in the last two weeks. Despite being introduced in 2021, Floki Inu has not achieved the same extraordinary level of success as renowned meme coins such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). However, it would be unjust to characterize FLOKI’s growth as disappointing. Since its launch, the token has experienced an impressive surge of 656.12%, illustrating its capacity for generating substantial returns. Potential Catalysts For Floki Inu’s Re-entry To Top 100 A pivotal factor in Floki Inu’s quest to reclaim its position among the top 100 cryptocurrencies is the cultivation of a more robust and engaged community. By fostering active participation, encouraging community-driven initiatives, and maintaining transparency through regular updates on the project’s development, FLOKI can significantly enhance its appeal to investors and crypto enthusiasts. Floki Inu also holds strong potential in the realm of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Notably, the trade volume associated with FLOKI’s NFTs has achieved remarkable milestones, reaching millions of dollars. Crypto total market inches up a bit at $1.12 trillion on the daily chart at TradingView.com Related Reading: Bitcoin Core 25.0 Hits The Market: A Sneak Peek Into The Future According to on-chain data, FLOKI’s total NFT volume surged to an impressive $16.25 million in April, illustrating the significant interest in non-fungible assets linked to the Floki Inu network. To regain its standing, Floki Inu must prioritize the enhancement of its token’s utility and innovative capabilities. By actively developing real-world use cases and forging strategic partnerships with businesses and platforms, FLOKI can establish a more solid foundation for long-term growth. This focus on utility will not only attract more users but also contribute to the token’s broader adoption and increased market capitalization. -Featured image from Science Photo Library",NEUTRAL,BTC | SHIB | FLOKI,BTC | ICO | MARKET | SHIB | FLOKI,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/floki-inu-does-meme-coin-have-what-it-takes-to-re-enter-top-100-spot/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/13003225.jpeg

Eligible applications will be rewarded 15% of the gas fees they produce, providing developers with marginal extra income.  This is part of a planned move called the “dApp Gas Monetization Program,” which passed a community governance vote earlier this year.  That proposal sought to reduce fantom’s current burn rate in order to redirect more network fees directly to applications building on Fantom. Now that it has passed, the implementation will reduce Fantom’s burn rate from 20% to 5% and redirect the 15% reduction toward gas monetization.  This gas monetization will reward in-demand applications, retain developers and is said to help support Fantom’s network infrastructure.  Gas refers to a type of fee paid by blockchain users in the native token of that blockchain, such as fantom (FTM) in this case. Fees on Fantom are fractions of a few cents per transaction, but add up to a significant amount over time – one that is borne by the users of Fantom-based projects.  Data shows some projects are already benefiting from the monetization program just hours after its Sunday implementation.

Trading volumes for the tokens, which are fashioned after the Shiba Inu dog breed, jumped to over $60 million, up from last week’s $25 million average. The spike comes as ads for its Floki game featured in some Chinese sporting tournaments. This could have attracted some speculators who hypothesized that the move might attract new traders from China.  In a tweet, Floki developers said they saw an influx of Chinese-based community members on their social media groups.  Floki previously said it was targeting China in its latest push toward attracting more users for its Valhalla game, as previously reported. The game’s content and technical documents will be available in both traditional Chinese and simplified Chinese and are specifically targeted toward the Chinese gaming market, developers added at the time.  The “China narrative” has caught on among some on Crypto Twitter ahead of lax laws for retail trading in Hong Kong, driving up prices of some Asia-focused tokens, such as conflux (CFX) in the past few weeks.  Starting June 1, Hong Kong will allow traders to invest in some tokens, such as bitcoin, ether and solana, on regulated exchanges in the country. Traders are not allowed to hold any stablecoins, but the move has fuelled sentiment that wealthy Chinese speculators could soon plough money into the crypto markets.  ""While most major economies are expected to slow down this year, the Chinese economy is projected to grow strongly,” said Floki core developer @100bviking in a Twitter message to CoinDesk. “J.P. Morgan projects a 4% GDP growth for China in 2023; that's 2.5 times more than what is projected for the global economy and 4 times more than projected US economic growth.”  “This strong growth will spill over into crypto, especially with Hong Kong legalizing crypto in a few days' time which is a sign of China warming up to crypto.

In addition, it links users to the Bitcoin network, a decentralized network of computers that combine to confirm and record Bitcoin transactions. Bitcoin Core is built to be secure and trustworthy. It employs cryptography to safeguard your transactions and Bitcoins. It also includes a built-in wallet and an intuitive interface, making it simpler for users to manage their Bitcoins.

Over the past 24 hours, the price of this altcoin has experienced a modest increase of nearly 2%. However, when observing the weekly chart, the price has only managed to appreciate by 3%. In terms of technical analysis, the outlook has favored the bulls, with buying strength exhibiting an uptick. Additionally, both demand and accumulation have displayed positive changes. As the price began to rise, ETH successfully surpassed a significant resistance level, crossing the $1,790 mark. Related Reading: XRP Revisits $0.47 – What Can Be Expected For Short-Term Price Movement? This breakthrough has enabled the bulls to gain control of the price action. Nevertheless, an important hurdle still remains to be overcome for ETH to witness a substantial rally. Notably, with the Bitcoin price demonstrating uncertain price action, several major altcoins have struggled to surpass their key price resistance levels. As BTC surpassed $27,000, the broader market’s increased strength might also contribute to the Ethereum upward price movement on its chart. The market capitalization of Ethereum witnessed an increase in the last trading session, indicating a return of buyers to the market. Ethereum Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, ETH was priced at $1,840. The altcoin has exhibited gradual appreciation following its breakthrough of the $1,790 resistance level. However, ETH has experienced intermittent corrections, and in order to halt this pattern, it needs to surpass the overhead price ceiling of $1,870. Surmounting this level would pave the way for ETH to trade near $1,900. Conversely, a drop from this level would bring ETH to $1,790 and subsequently to $1,740. The volume of ETH traded in the last session appeared positive, indicating reduced selling pressure on the chart. Technical Analysis Following ETH’s breakthrough of the $1,840 price level, buyers made further attempts to reenter the market. This resulted in a shift in demand into the positive zone. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) surged past the half-line, signaling that buyers outnumbered sellers in the market. In line with this, the ETH price also moved above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, indicating that buyers were steering the price momentum in the market. In addition to the aforementioned technical indicators, ETH displayed further buy signals. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicated the price momentum and reversals through the formation of green histograms, which were growing in size.

Jimbos said it was working with security researchers to reclaim lost funds – the same people who’ve previously helped Euler Finance recover over $200 million – and added that they would contact law enforcement by 4 P.M. UTC on Monday if the attacker failed to return the money.  Jimbos lost 4,090 ether (ETH) late on Saturday, which security analysts blamed on the lack of slippage control in the main contract. This allowed the yet-unidentified attackers to take out a $5.9 million flash loan, manipulate the prices of jimbo (JIMBO), and walk out with treasury funds.  The protocol planned to issue a semi-stable token backed by a basket of crypto tokens, alluring traders to this concept as similar projects have seen brief success.  Flash loans are a popular way for attackers to gain funds to conduct exploits on decentralized finance (DeFi) systems. The loans allow traders to borrow unsecured funds from lenders using smart contracts instead of third parties.  These do not require any collateral because the contract considers the transaction complete only when the borrower repays the lender – meaning a borrower defaulting on a flash loan would cause the smart contract to cancel the transaction, and the money would be returned to the lender.  Meanwhile, JIMBO, its token, traded at nearly 18 cents on Monday, slightly recovering in Asian morning hours as developers floated their protective plans.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | ARB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/29/arbitrum-based-jimbos-protocol-scurries-for-revival-after-7m-exploit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5844591d4fc53908b4ecc1fda0511af88a269620-6024x4024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, considering recent development within the Band Protocol ecosystem, there could be more upsides as the project unveils new features and strikes strategic partnerships. Horizen Partnership Recently, Band Protocol, a platform focusing on cross-chain data oracles, partnered with Horizen, a public blockchain offering a scalable ecosystem for decentralized applications (dapps). The goal is to provide EON, Horizen’s recently launched EVM-compatible intelligent contracting platform, with access to decentralized oracle services. In this way, decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) within the EON ecosystem will have real-time pricing information and reliable data via Band Protocol’s middleware solutions. Related Reading: Monaco, NFTs, And Formula 1: Reasons Polygon Is Bullish EON uses Band Protocol’s primary Oracle solution to provide real-time token price feeds across several blockchain networks. Integrating these two platforms ensures the integrity of EON’s data, which will be essential in developing the company’s DeFi, gaming, and NFT ecosystem. Band Protocol’s ability to gather and integrate real-world data and APIs to intelligent contracts may help EON become less reliant on centralized oracles, which introduce points of failure. This new link allows programmers to enhance and expand the functionality of EON intelligent contracts. According to Rob Viglione, co-founder, and CEO of Horizon Labs, the relationship with Band Protocol is a broad step forward in the company’s efforts to provide a safe and scalable environment for DApps. The reliable oracle services provided by Band Protocol allow programmers to design innovative software for DeFi, gaming, and NFTs. Integrating Band Protocol’s oracle solution, Horizen EON can now provide their intelligent contracts with accurate, real-time price data. Due to this collaboration, new possibilities in DeFi, gaming, and NFT applications will emerge, and the whole blockchain ecosystem will become more robust and decentralized. Band Protocol Planning For SubDAOs Moreover, Band Protocol has proposed the implementation of SubDAOs. According to Shine Sutheeravet, head of operations at Band Protocol, the goal is to address challenges in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). SubDAOs offer solutions for complexity management, efficient resource allocation, specialized expertise, flexibility, inclusivity, and scalability. The proposal suggests transforming the Cosmos Group module into councils to establish clear governance structures. Related Reading: European Commission To Present Regulatory Framework For Digital Euro In June At the moment, Band Protocol is seeking community feedback to refine and optimize this governance framework and drive the growth of the SubDAO ecosystem.

12997911,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=535402,1685334307,Ethereum’s Block Size Surges To 1-Month High – What This Means For ETH,"Ethereum, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has witnessed a significant surge in its mean block size, reaching a new 1-month high. This milestone was recently announced by Glassnode, a renowned on-chain analysis platform. The increase in block size indicates a notable improvement in Ethereum’s network capacity and transaction throughput, potentially bringing positive implications for the ecosystem. Breaking Down The Block Size Surge The mean block size of Ethereum has skyrocketed, surpassing the previous 1-month high recorded on May 27, 2023. Glassnode’s data reveals that the current mean block size stands at 121.4 million. This surge highlights a substantial increase in the average data volume accommodated within individual blocks of the Ethereum blockchain. Related Reading: Gas Crisis Averted: NFT Marketplaces Witness Dramatic Reduction in Ethereum Fees Larger block size is indicative of Ethereum’s ability to handle more data and transactions per block, effectively enhancing the network’s capacity. With a higher average data volume in recent blocks, ETH showcases its potential for improved scalability and transaction throughput. Ethereum’s surge in block size signifies a positive development for the ETH ecosystem, as it accommodates the growing demands and usage of the network. What This Means For Ethereum The surge in Ethereum’s mean block size holds several implications for ETH and its community. Firstly, it signifies the network’s continued growth and adoption. As more participants engage with the Ethereum blockchain, the increased block size demonstrates the platform’s ability to handle a higher volume of transactions, leading to enhanced efficiency and reduced congestion. Moreover, the surge in block size also contributes to improved transaction throughput. With larger block sizes, more transactions can be included in each block, resulting in faster confirmation times and smoother user experiences. This development is crucial for applications built on the Ethereum network, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces, and various other decentralized applications (dApps). It enables them to process a greater number of transactions within a given timeframe, fostering better scalability and usability. Additionally, Ethereum’s increased block size may have a positive impact on gas fees. Gas fees, which are transaction fees on the Ethereum network, can be influenced by block size. A larger block size allows for the inclusion of more transactions, potentially alleviating congestion and reducing gas fees. This could lead to a more cost-effective and accessible environment for users and developers utilizing the Ethereum ecosystem.

In a statement released Monday morning, the fund said there was “fraudulent conduct intentionally hidden from investors, including Temasek.”  ""Although there was no misconduct by the investment team in reaching their investment recommendation, the investment team and senior management, who are ultimately responsible for investment decisions made, took collective accountability and had their compensation reduced,"" Temasek Chairman Lim Boon Heng said in a statement posted to its website.  Days after FTX collapsed in November, the fund said it had written off the entirety of its investment. In November, Temasek said that the $210 million investment, which accounted for 1% of FTX International, and $65 million for 1.5% of FTX.US, represented 0.09% of the firm's net portfolio value of $293.5 billion (SGD 403 billion) from last year.  At the time, Temasek claimed that it did eight months of due diligence on FTX, reviewing its audited financial statements, analyzing regulatory risk, and cyber security threats. Post the collapse of FTX, Temasek said that intends to refine its investment appraisal procedure, especially for rapidly growing firms.  Temasek reiterated that it does not plan to invest in cryptocurrencies and said it will be cautious when considering new investments in the blockchain space. FTX was the only investment Temasek had in a crypto exchange.  During the heydays of FTX it was accessible to users based in Singapore, while Binance, its chief rival, was blocked.

42410580,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdfbzs,1685325600,"Indian Crypto Exchanges Are in Survival Mode, Trying to Extend Their Runways","Indian crypto exchanges are in survival mode, cutting costs wherever possible, re-negotiating partner contracts, suspending employee pay-hikes, conducting lay-offs, exploring new revenue models and rebranding themselves, all in an effort to extend their financial runways – when they run out of money.  CoinDesk spoke to employees and senior executives at six prominent Indian crypto platforms – CoinDCX, CoinSwitch, WazirX, BuyUCoin, ZebPay and Giottus. Several of these exchanges said their runways range from 21 months to four years, which can, if true, likely take them into the next bull market. CoinSwitch and ZebPay did not share their financial runway timelines.  The survival of India’s crypto exchanges has been a concern since Feb. 1, 2022, when the nation announced stiff taxes – a 30% tax on crypto profits and the more controversial 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) on all transactions. At the time, local industry leaders said they had entered a “period of pain” but that ""ultimately, technology always emerges, it always wins.""  Signs of a crypto “brain drain” emerged within weeks. Ten days after the taxes were implemented, crypto trading volumes plummeted, in some cases more than 70%. India’s government then imposed a ""shadow ban,” which saw local payment processors cut off banking access to crypto exchanges.  Four months into the imposition of the 30% tax, the industry’s advocacy body was disbanded and enforcement agencies were investigating at least 10 crypto exchanges for allegedly assisting foreign firms launder money via crypto. Soon, the world took note and global industry leaders such as Binance CEO Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao claimed India’s taxes would probably “kill the industry” in the country.  By 2023, data revealed crypto traffic in the nation continued its nosedive and that Indians had moved more than $3.8 billion in trading volume from local to international crypto exchanges.  India, as president of the Group of 20 (G-20) in 2023, has prioritized framing globally coordinated rules for the crypto sector. As a result, experts say, it needed to align with the guidelines of the global standard setter, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on virtual assets by including Indian crypto business under anti-money laundering rules.  This move, which adds some legitimacy to the sector by way of setting up regulatory oversight, has fueled a little optimism among Indian exchanges on the local industry’s longevity, even if the nation doesn’t change its tax regime, according to several industry officials. But they don’t have an answer to what happens if the tax regime stays the same – and are taking various steps to guard against such a scenario.  Read More: India Has Clamped Down on Crypto. What Will It Do With Its G-20 Power?  CoinDCX  Indian crypto exchange CoinDCX is weathering the storm by diversifying and banking on its recent series D funding of $135 million.  “We have a runway of four years,” under present conditions, said Neeraj Khandelwal, co-founder of CoinDCX and Okto. “Our biggest bet is on our Okto Wallet. We believe DeFi [decentralized finance] will offer 10X value eventually as only 6.5 million DeFi customers exist, while there are 400 million crypto investors.”  CoinDCX has been leading engagement with lawmakers through the industry’s policy advocacy body, Khandelwal said, exemplified by a recent event, and has emerged as a major player in the Indian crypto industry after recent setbacks faced by WazirX, who ostensibly led the industry in policy engagement before CoinDCX.  Its strategy, Khandelwal says, is “investing heavily in innovation and technology,” including hiring in the space “even now” as we “never overhired.”  WazirX  WazirX, India’s biggest exchange by trading volume until recently, continues to survive despite a tumultuous year.  The exchange’s future seemed uncertain when its founder Nischal Shetty moved from India to Dubai to focus on a new project late last year. Later, Indian agencies that were investigating local crypto exchanges raided properties tied to a director of WazirX. Shortly after, Binance CEO Zhao and Shetty were involved in a public spat over who truly controls the exchange – a quarrel that continues to this day.  The events have seen the exchange lay off 40% of its staff. Yet, the exchange has a 21-month runway, said an employee who was not authorized to speak publicly about the company. “But employees who deserve pay hikes won’t be getting them,” he said.  WazirX’s survival strategy is to renegotiate contracts with partners including software vendors, the person said. Unlike some other exchanges, WazirX will not be diversifying. It will stay focused on crypto.  “That’s what the founders enshrined into us,” the person said. “The idea is to survive because [the] Bitcoin halving is going to happen in May 2024 when, we hope, a bull run will come. By then, if things don’t break, we should be around to see it.” The Bitcoin halving is when the total number of bitcoin that miners can potentially win is halved. This happens roughly every four years.  WazirX also plans to “keep chipping away at costs constantly to extend the runway” and capitalize on its 15 million registered users to attract lucrative partnerships, like a recent one with tax solutions provider TaxNodes.  CoinSwitch  CoinSwitch shed “Kuber” from its previous name, CoinSwitch Kuber, and pivoted from being a crypto exchange to a crypto investment platform.  This occurred as India’s taxes, the crypto winter and the ire of Indian agencies all hit the platform hard. CoinSwitch properties were raided by Indian agencies in August 2022.  “CoinSwitch has always been conscious of its expenses,” said Ashish Singhal, the company’s co-founder and CEO. “Today, we are proudly serving more than 19 million registered users, and are excited to grow and evolve with them by providing them with a diverse range of investment options, including fixed deposits (FD), mutual funds, Indian stocks, and more.”  Without giving a timeline on its runway, Singhal said “our healthy runway gives us enough ammunition to invest in our long-term vision – to be a one-stop wealth-tech destination for Indians.”  Singhal also said his company has “strengthened its leadership team by hiring industry experts,” presumably to navigate regulators, even if he added that the recent step to bring crypto businesses under anti-money laundering rules was a “significant positive advancement.”  ZebPay  One of India’s first crypto exchanges, ZebPay, also refused to share a timeline on its runway. But Chief Revenue Officer Nirmal Ranga said it had support from an unnamed subsidiary in Singapore, in the event it loses customers, the bear market extends or things generally go from bad to worse.  “Our internal revenue strategy is to increase the lending value of our customers and concentrate on user growth,” Ranga said. “We are also trying to create interest for institutional investment.”  Given ZebPay’s team has seen crypto’s early up and down cycles, it follows two ways to survive – “use profits made during previous bull runs or use funds from marketing partnerships or investors,” Ranga said. Like WazirX, ZebPay also has a partnership with TaxNodes.  BuyUCoin  Another early player in the Indian crypto space, BuyUCoin, said its runway extends until early 2025.  “By the end of 2024, we will see a good bull run,” said Atulya Bhatt, its co-founder. “Crypto is a seasonal market and every four years bitcoin goes up and down. It will take 10 years for crypto to become completely sustainable.”  Nevertheless, BuyUCoin had to lay off 10% of its 100 people workforce, Bhatt said. At the same time, BuyUCoin has set up sister companies in Estonia and Singapore as part of a global expansion plan.  “Since we have never raised funds, we can now, given interest from partners across the globe,” he said.  Giottus  After FTX’s implosion, crypto entities scrambled to publish proof of reserves. Giottus, a lesser-known Indian exchange recognized for its staking service and multilingual options in the country, said it would provide customers with proof of reserves, while rivals remained silent.  “We have a two-year runway under the current conditions,” said Vikram Subburaj, Giottus' co-founder and CEO. “Our focus is completely on bringing in operational excellence, building your products right, drastically cutting marketing and acquisition expenses, and reducing perceived risks associated with exchanges.”  In terms of employees, Subburaj said Giottus had a compact marketing team even during bull runs and like others, it partnered with TaxNodes to improve operational support.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Crypto and Asian stock markets opened strongly as the White House announced a deal averting a debt ceiling crisis, with Bitcoin and Ether seeing increases of 5% and 4.9%, respectively.  Insights: China didn't say much new about Web3 in a paper it released over the weekend, but the report represented progress in a country that has scaled back its approach to cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin is starting the Asia trading day up 5% to $28,249, while ether is up 4.9% to $1,917. Overall, the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) is up 4% to 1,209.  Bitcoin is still down 2.8% during the past month, as the looming debt ceiling crisis weighed heavily on the asset class.  ""Bitcoin found support around $25K and consolidated for about two weeks before rallying today,"" Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital wrote in an email. ""Whether this move continues till $30K remains to be seen, but we expect the market leader to test that key resistance once again in the near term.""  DiPasquale added: On the flip side, the range between $22K and $25K is acting as a reliable support for bulls.""  House Speaker Kevin McCarthy told reporters over the weekend that there's still work to be done on the bill, anticipating its completion by Sunday, and a vote by Wednesday.  Meanwhile, President Biden said the deal is ""an important step forward"" in a statement, calling it a compromise.  Stock markets in Asia are also opening strong on the news. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 was up 2% in the first 30 minutes of trading, while Australia’s ASX 200 was up 1.18%.

Insights  China’s Web3 Isn’t Our Web3  Over the weekend, authorities at the Beijing Municipal Science & Technology Commission, which oversees the Zhongguancun Chaoyang Park – a cluster of China’s top tech companies and academic institutions – released a whitepaper outlining suggestions for China’s web3 policy.  On Crypto Twitter, this excited the usual crowd, egged on by a tweet from Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, who said the timing was “interesting” considering Hong Kong’s soon-to-be-enabled crypto regulatory framework on June 1.  But the reality is this whitepaper is more of China’s existing policy of blockchain-not-crypto.  Web3, in China, means an internet enhanced by artificial intelligence, blockchain, faster computing chips and more resilient networks.  The whitepaper is more interested in defining – and enhancing – the layers of infrastructure behind the internet, which it identifies as the infrastructure layer, interactive terminal layer, platform tool layer and application layer, in a way that’s reminiscent of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model of network layers, which has been the bible of network topology since the 1980s.  And by no means is this a bad thing. It might be time that our understanding of a network layer is updated to account for new technologies, and China is keen to write the next generation of technology standards to wrestle that away from a U.S.-led Western technology trade bloc.  But this doesn’t have anything to do with crypto.  Bulls of the China narrative say that mainland China is only a few steps behind Hong Kong in opening its doors to crypto trading, just like how it looked to the semi-autonomous territory for lessons in stock markets before opening its own. This might be the case now, but a lot has to be figured out before then, such as how to allow crypto trading to exist without running into conflict with mainland China’s rules on capital control.  That’s the subject for another day, though. Meanwhile, China isn’t embracing crypto – yet.  Important events.
